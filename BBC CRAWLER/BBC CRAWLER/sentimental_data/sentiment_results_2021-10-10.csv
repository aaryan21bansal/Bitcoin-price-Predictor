"Liberty Steel has secured a Â£50m cash injection which it says will safeguard 660 jobs at its plant in Rotherham. The deal is part of a wider restructure of GFG Alliance, Liberty's owner, which was forced to seek funding when its key lender, Greensill Capital, collapsed. GFG Alliance said the cash would allow the Rotherham plant to reopen this month after being closed since spring. Community, the steelworkers' union, said it was ""overdue"" but was ""an important step in the right direction"". Jeffrey Kabel, GFG's chief transformation officer, said: ""The injection of Â£50m of shareholder funds into Liberty Steel UK is an important step in our restructuring and transformation. ""It will help to create sustainable value, ensure that Liberty has the ability to raise and deploy capital quickly in the UK and enable our businesses to demonstrate their potential and agree long-term debt restructuring."" At the beginning of the year, Liberty Steel employed 3,000 steelworkers in the UK. But its future was thrown into doubt when Greensill collapsed in early March. GFG has been struggling to raise new financing since then, while the majority of its workers have been on furlough. In April, GFG approached the government for help, but the request was rejected by Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng. GFG, one of the UK's largest industrial groups, is owned by businessman Sanjeev Gupta. Kwarteng defends rejecting Liberty Steel bailout How metal tycoon Sanjeev Gupta built his empire A further 2,000 people work at other GFG steel sites in the UK. GFG said the cash injection would allow Liberty Steel (LSUK) to restart its electric arc furnace at Rotherham. ""Production ramp-up will commence in October 2021 with a plan to reach 50,000 tonnes per month as soon as possible,"" it added. ""The restart of operations will enable colleagues to return to work, setting the platform for LSUK's longer-term refinancing and delivery of its plan to expand Rotherham's capacity, creating a two million tonnes per annum green steel plant."" News of the move was welcomed by industry body UK Steel. A spokesperson said it was ""really good news for not only the company, but those many thousands of workers and their families, the communities where those jobs a located and of course the whole of the UK steel sector"". ""Our friends at Liberty Steel can now fire up those furnaces, make the steel that this economy needs and most importantly give some certainty to the well-paid and highly-skilled workforce."" But the spokesperson added: ""The last thing the sector needs now is for government to merely sit on its hands and risk an energy crisis becoming a steel industry crisis."" UK Steel called on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to intervene on the industry's behalf ""before it is too late"". Roy Rickhuss, general secretary of Community, said the deal ""demonstrates that GFG can raise funds for the UK"". ""Huge challenges remain,"" Mr Rickhuss said. ""But the workforce is ready to get back to making the best steels money can buy and the Â£50m injection will enable us to restart steelmaking."" Meanwhile, plans are proceeding to sell off GFG's Speciality Steel business, which employs about 750 staff at plants in South Yorkshire. GFG said the cash lifeline would help Speciality Steel to ""establish a stable operating environment and create an attractive asset"". Further afield, GFG said it had also agreed a debt restructuring for Liberty's Australian division with Credit Suisse Asset Management. Greensill's heavy exposure to Mr Gupta's business had prompted Credit Suisse to freeze withdrawals from up to Â£10bn worth of funds held as security.

"UK demands on the Northern Ireland Protocol could cause ""a breakdown in relations"" with the EU, Ireland's foreign minister has warned. Simon Coveney made the comments after the UK reiterated that it wants the European Court of Justice (ECJ) removed from oversight of the deal. Mr Coveney said this was the creation of a new ""red line"" which the EU cannot move on. The EU will bring forward proposals on Wednesday for reforming the protocol. The Northern Ireland Protocol isthe special Brexit deal for Northern Ireland, which the UK and EU agreed in 2019. The EU proposals will focus on easing practical problems with the movement of goods from Britain to Northern Ireland, rather than changing oversight arrangements. However, on Tuesday, the UK's Brexit Minister Lord Frost will give a speech in which he is expected to tell diplomats that removing the ECJ's role in dispute settlement is necessary to sustain the protocol. Lord Frost is due to give his speech on Tuesday He is due to say: ""Without new arrangements in this area the protocol will never have the support it needs to survive. ""The role of the ECJ in Northern Ireland and the consequent inability of the UK government to implement the very sensitive arrangements in the protocol in a reasonable way has created a deep imbalance in the way the protocol operates."" The protocol keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods and the ECJ acts as the supreme interpreter of the single market's rules. In 2019, the UK agreed to the ECJ's role, but in July this year the government said it had only done that because of the ""very specific circumstances"" of the protocol negotiation. What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? Boris Johnson says NI Protocol could work if it was 'fixed' What is Article 16 and what exactly does it say? It now wants a new governance arrangement in which disputes would ultimately be resolved by an independent arbitrator. Writing on Twitter, Mr Coveney suggested the UK position would not help resolve practical problems. He said: ""EU working seriously to resolve practical issues with implementation of Protocol - so UKG creates a new ""red line"" barrier to progress, that they know EU can't move onâ¦. are we surprised?"" He added that the ""real question"" was: ""Does UKG actually want an agreed way forward or a further breakdown in relations?"" Lord Frost later responded to Mr Coveney on social media, saying he would prefer ""not to do negotiations on Twitter"" but that ""the issue of governance and the ECJ is not new"". ""We set out our concerns three months ago in our 21 July Command Paper. The problem is that too few people seem to have listened."" As the protocol works by keeping Northern Ireland in the single market for goods, the EU has said removing the ECJ would simply unravel the whole arrangement. Mr Å efÄoviÄ told an event in Dublin that he hoped talks would begin before the end of October Speaking last week, European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic said: ""I find it hard to see how Northern Ireland would stay or would keep the access to the single market without oversight of the European Court of Justice."" When the EU publishes its proposals next week that is expected to lead to a new round of negotiations. Both sides have suggested there will be short, intense talks process beginning in late October or early November. What is the new Northern Ireland Brexit trade deal?

"This video can not be played Consistency and the lack of publicity around Covid passes are some issues raised by people in Cardiff People in Wales now need an NHS Covid pass to be able to legally attend big events or nightclubs. They are compulsory for over-18s, and show people have either tested negative on a lateral flow test or are fully vaccinated against Covid. Wales' rugby game against New Zealand on 30 October will be one of the first mass events to require Covid passes. Some nightclub bosses said they felt ""singled out"" by the rules, but other people said they felt reassured. First Minister Mark Drakeford said the new scheme was ""vulnerable to abuse"" but the ""huge bulk of people"" will follow the new rules. What is a Covid pass and how do I get one? Covid pass breaches 'should not be police priority' Wales to introduce Covid passes from next month The Principality Stadium, with a capacity of almost 75,000, will be one of the first to host a mass event with Covid passes Asked if people could falsify their lateral flow tests, Mr Drakeford said: ""It is vulnerable to people who want to abuse the system but that's why the law is there."" ""I am quite sure the huge bulk of people will use the lateral flow test in the correct way,"" he told ITV's Good Morning Britain programme. He also rejected claims the new Covid pass was a financial burden for businesses, adding: ""Nightclubs already have to check people for their age. ""I don't think the cost issue is a very significant one here."" In its autumn and winter plan Mr Drakeford's government has not ruled out extending the scheme if further action is needed to tackle Covid rates. He suggested that could include using passes when going to care homes or visiting hospitals. ""If numbers in the community continue to rise... being able to show a Covid pass if you were going into a care home might be an extra defence,"" he said. Covid passes will be required in nightclubs in Wales, under the plans Welsh Education Minister Jeremy Miles toldBBC Politics Walesthat public services were expected to face ""significant pressure"" this winter, and the pass would cut transmission of the virus. The Senedd voted on the passes last Tuesday - a vote the Welsh government saidwill not be repeated, despite it passing by just one vote. Anyone who is over 16 and has been fully vaccinated in Wales or England, or has had a negative lateral flow test result within the past 48 hours, can get a pass. They are compulsory for anyone over 18 to enter: Nightclubs or similar venues Indoor no-seating events with more than 500 people Outdoor no-seating events with more than 4,000 people Any event with more than 10,000 people, including sport The Welsh government says any venue that can serve alcohol, is open between midnight and 0500, and where music is provided for dancing will need to check for passes. That means it could cover other venues not traditionally considered nightclubs which have a late licence. Venues can either apply the pass rules from when they open their doors, or when they open their dancefloor. Negative tests will be self-certified but the Welsh governmentplans to make it illegal to fake a negative test. Large events could also be allowed to check passes at random, rather than check every person who attends. The Welsh government says the passes can be downloaded to people's phones TheNHS Covid Pass,externalis available digitally but you need to register for anNHS login,externalvia the website. You need to upload a photo of your ID. That can be a passport, full UK driving licence or full European driving licence. This allows you to produce a Covid pass using a smart phone, computer or laptop. Your NHS Covid Pass includes a barcode. The expiry date refers to the barcode and will update automatically. It does not apply to your vaccination status. In Wales, you cannot get the pass via the NHS app, as this is only valid in England. Big sport games are some of the bigger events that will be affected by the rule change Wales is not the first nation to introduce such a pass. In France, people have had to prove they are fully vaccinated, have recently tested negative or recently recovered from Covid with a ""health pass"". That must be produced on entering cafes, restaurants or public transport. Scotland is the only other UK nation to use them afterthey were introduced on 1 October. Mike Murray will close Prestatyn's Bar 236 early rather than implement passes One nightclub and bar in Denbighshire has decided to close earlier in the evening rather than dealing with the ""complexity"" of implementing Covid passes. Mike Murray, manager of Bar 236 in Prestatyn, said the club used to stay open past midnight with live music and DJs, but would need extra staffing to police the system, and it was not worth it financially. ""We always weighed up the situation, following the government guidelines to make it a safe and comfortable environment to drink in. Since the hospitality industry re-opened, staff have erred on the side of caution when observing the rules, says Mike Murray of Bar 236 in Prestatyn ""We've even been keeping masks on and doing table service after the government advice changed because what's wrong with doing it a little longer to keep people comfortable?"" He added he received a lack of guidance from Welsh government as to ""what passes would look like or where we could get one from if people asked"". ""We want people to come in and let common sense prevail: If you're unwell, don't come to the bar."" Nightclub owner Guto Brychan said different rules could be a problem as students return from outside Wales The decision to introduce Covid passes has very much split opinion, which was evident in the Senedd vote. Guto Brychan, chief executive of Cardiff music venue Clwb Ifor Bach, said the timing made things difficult as students had just returned to university and it is ""the busiest time of year"". He said this was made more difficult because many students are from outside Wales and may not understand the law. Clubbers and businesses torn over Wales Covid pass Mr Brychan said: ""One of the main concerns as well is that the Covid pass isn't uniform across the whole of the hospitality industry. ""It seems to have been specifically designed to target places that supply dancing or culture, but I'd argue the high risk activity here is the consumption of alcohol, not dancing. ""There'll be plenty of venues open as late as ourselves that will have as many people in them but won't have the restrictions that we have in place."" Lidi Staffurth has been shielding during the pandemic and said the rules will make shielders feel more comfortable Lidi Staffurth is one of thousands of people who have been shielding during the pandemic due to a condition which makes them extremely vulnerable to Covid-19. She said Covid passes would help reassure people who might feel uncertain about attending large events, adding she felt she had her ""freedom back"". Ms Staffurth labelled it a ""brilliant idea"", not least because there are three young people in her family. ""If they're in large groups then we'll know they're around people who are double vaccinated, or at least free from Covid,"" she said. ""I think it's a fantastic idea and for a society at large it means people are looking after each other. ""I think some young people just don't care - they've had it with Covid, and I think we've all had it with Covid - but they live in their own little bubble and they don't really see beyond that bubble a lot. ""And that's fair enough, but it means with a Covid pass they're made to consider that."" David Chapman, executive director for UK Hospitality in Wales, called for ""tolerance"" from government, licencing authorities and the public as the passes were introduced. He toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfastthere was some ""trepidation"" in the industry, particularly about alignment with England, as well as staff shortages. ""We've got staffing problems as people will know already and more labour intensive moves such as this actually makes it quite difficult for a business to juggle resources well at the moment,"" he said. He also called for the ""easiest possible trading conditions"" over Christmas, saying businesses had been told passes would stop ""stop at a certain point when society and the health service can cope"". Proof of vaccination has already been required for some large events Dr Mair Hopkin, chairwoman of the Royal College of General Practitioners in Wales, said the risk of Covid will increase as the weather gets worse and people spend more time indoors. She said: ""They've introduced them in France and it seems to have been very acceptable to the French population, and also it seems to have coincided with a more rapid drop in their incidence rates. ""If that happens here then that would be a good thing."" Economy Minister Vaughan Gething said he would not ""expect perfection on day one"" as the system is introduced. He said: ""We do accept there may be problems in venues getting used to what they need to do."" Covid pass plans agreed in tight Senedd decision Where do I need to use a Covid passport?

"People will have to get used to higher food prices, the boss of Kraft Heinz has told the BBC. Miguel Patricio said the international food giant, which makes tomato sauce and baked beans, was putting up prices in several countries. Unlike in previous years, he said, inflation was ""across the board"". The cost of ingredients such as cereals and oils has pushed global food prices to a 10-year high, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation. Kraft Heinz has increased prices on more than half its products in the US, its home market, and Mr Patricio admitted that is happening elsewhere too. ""We are raising prices, where necessary, around the world,"" he said. During the pandemic, many countries saw production of raw materials, ranging from crops to vegetable oils, fall. Measures to control the virus, as well as illness, limited output and delivery. As economies have restarted, the supply of these products hasn't been able to keep up with returning demand, leading to higher prices. Higher wages and energy prices have also added to the burden for manufacturers. Prices in major economies 'to continue to rise' Toy giant warns of higher prices as costs rise What is inflation and why does it matter? Mr Patricio said this broad range of factors was contributing to the rising cost of food. ""Specifically in the UK, with the lack of truck drivers. In [the] US logistic costs also increased substantially, and there's a shortage of labour in certain areas of the economy."" Kraft Heinz chief executive, Miguel Patricio, says consumers need to get used to higher food prices Mr Patricio said that consumers would need to get used to higher food prices, given that the world's population was rising whilst the amount of land on which to grow food was not. In the longer term ""there's a lot to come in technology to improve the effectiveness of farmers"" that will help, he said. Not all cost increases should be passed on to consumers, Mr Patricio said. Firms would have to absorb some of the rise in costs. ""I think it's up to us, and to the industry, and to the other companies, to try to minimise these price increases,"" he said. But big food producers like Kraft Heinz, Nestle and PepsiCo ""will most likely have to pass that cost on to consumers"" according to Kona Haque, head of research at the agricultural commodities firm ED&F Man. ""Whether it's corn, sugar, coffee, soybeans, palm oil, you name it, all of these basic food commodities have been rising,"" she said. ""Poor harvests in Brazil, which is one of the world's biggest agricultural exporters, drought in Russia, reduced planting in the US and stockpiling in China have combined with more expensive fertiliser, energy and shipping costs to push prices up."" But she said food producers would all be affected and would therefore all be raising prices in similar ways: ""because it's so widespread that everyone will do it, meaning they probably won't lose customers"". This weekPespsiCo warned,externalit was also facing rising costs on everything from transport to raw ingredients, and said that further prices rises were likely at the start of next year. However, as well as pushing up costs, the pandemic did help boost sales for some Kraft Heinz brands, Mr Patricio said, because staying in meant ""people are cooking far more than they were before"". Customers in the UK bought more Heinz Baked Beans, while customers in the US bought more Kraft Mac & Cheese. Overall sales rose 1.6% to $13bn in the first half of this year, representing a slight slowdown. The results were described by Erin Lash, at the investment firm Morningstar, as ""still quite impressive relative to the comparable pre-pandemic period in 2019"". The company is also undergoing an extensive restructuring under Mr Patricio, involving selling some old, and buying some new brands, which Ms Lash said was ""narrowing its focus and increasing its spending on innovation and marketing"" which would support future sales. Why even huge ships can't fix the shipping crisis 'We pay $16,000 for shipping - it used to be $2,800' Disruption to shipping could last until Christmas Mr Patricio said the firm was also spending significant sums on developing new packaging to meet its aims on reducing plastic waste. Most of the 650 million bottles of ketchup the firm sells every year are plastic, for example. But Mr Patricio said the firm was ""encouraging"" customers to buy glass bottles even though they are less convenient ""because you have to tap on the bottom"". He added: ""We are working hard, not only on the plastic bottles, but everywhere in our footprint that has plastic."" The pandemic led to a shortage of ketchup sachets as demand for takeaways soared Campaigners against plastic waste would like to see a reduction in the use of single serving sachets. However followinga shortageof sachets during the pandemic, as consumers bought more takeaways from restaurants, Kraft Heinz has invested in expanding production of them by 30%. ""Thanks God we did that, because now we don't have that [shortage] problem anymore"", said Mr Patricio. But he said the company was working on a solution ""to cutting the amount of plastic they use"".

"The couple allegedly tried to sell secrets about US nuclear submarines to a foreign government A US navy nuclear engineer and his wife have been charged with trying to sell nuclear secrets to what they thought was a foreign state. Jonathan Toebbe and his wife Diana were arrested in West Virginia on Saturday, the Justice Department announced. They allegedly tried to sell nuclear submarine design data, hidden in a peanut butter sandwich, to someone they thought represented another country. In fact, it was an undercover FBI agent. According to the statement,external, Mr Toebbe and his partner - 42 and 45 respectively - have now been charged under the Atomic Energy Act. Mr Toebbe worked in the US Navy's nuclear propulsion programme and had national security clearance. His wife is a high school teacher. The Justice Department said that in April 2020 he sent a package to an unnamed foreign government containing restricted data and a message suggesting a covert relationship, so that they could buy more data from him. He then allegedly began writing to an individual by encrypted email. While he thought this person represented the foreign government, they were actually an FBI agent, the affidavit said. James Bond and MI6: Is there fact in fiction? MI5 warns of spies using LinkedIn to steal secrets Five Russian hacks that transformed US cyber-security After several months, the accused couple allegedly made a deal to share secret information in exchange for around $100,000 (Â£73,000) in cryptocurrency. In June this year, Jonathan and Diana Toebbe travelled to West Virginia to drop off the data. With Diana acting as a lookout, Jonathan ""placed an SD card concealed within half a peanut butter sandwich"" at a determined location, the affidavit said. After the agent collected the card, they sent payment and received a decryption key to access the SD card. On it was restricted data ""related to submarine nuclear reactors"". Mr Toebbe then performed a second so-called dead drop - this time hidden inside a chewing gum packet - in August, with yet more secret data on it. FBI agents then arrested the couple on Saturday, during a third dead drop. The couple are set to appear in federal court on 12 October.

"This video can not be played Dr Jenny Harries: We're facing an 'uncertain' winter The UK is facing an uncertain winter with the spread of coronavirus and the flu, the head of the Health Security Agency Jenny Harries has said. People are at ""more significant risk of death and of serious illness if they are co-infected"" with both viruses, she told the BBC. She said: ""It's a more uncertain year but I certainly would be encouraging everybody to go and get their vaccine."" More than 40 million people in the UK are being offered a flu jab this year. For the first time this includes all secondary school children up to the age of 16. The over-50s and younger adults with health conditions are also being offered a Covid booster jab this autumn and winter. Covid symptoms: Is it a cold or coronavirus? Flu jab vital this winter along with Covid vaccine How can I get a flu jab? Dr Harries, former deputy chief medical officer for England, told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: ""This is probably the first season where we will have significant amounts of Covid circulating as well as flu. ""People's behaviours have changed, we are mixing more, winter weather is coming along, everybody is going into enclosed spaces."" She said because of social distancing and other measures during the pandemic the public has not had the flu exposure they usually would, ""so people are susceptible"". Flu kills about 11,000 people on average every winter in England and during the last bad flu winter of 2017-18 the toll was more than double that - with more than 300 deaths a day during the peak. Research shows those infected with both viruses are more than twice as likely to die as someone with Covid alone. Areport,externalfrom the Academy of Medical Sciences suggests that respiratory illness could hit very high levels this winter, causing severe strain on the NHS and between 15,000 and 60,000 deaths. Thelatest government figures,externalreleased on Sunday show the UK recorded new 34,574 Covid cases. There were also 38 deaths recorded within 28 days of a positive test, taking the total number of people to die in the past week to 785. Dr Harries said the current number of deaths from Covid was not seen as ""acceptable"" officials were still ""taking it extremely seriously"". She told the Andrew Marr show: ""We are starting to move to a situation where, perhaps Covid is not the most significant element and many of those individuals affected will of course have other comorbidities which will make them vulnerable to serious illness for other reasons as well."" She said the ""extremely good vaccine uptake"" was preventing ""very significant amounts of hospitalisation and death"". But Dr Harries said it was now ""one of the most difficult times to predict what will come"" with coronavirus. ""We have different levels of vaccination, we have a little bit of immunity waning in older individuals, which is why we're now starting to put in a Covid booster vaccine,"" she said. ""We have slightly different effectiveness in different vaccinations that have been provided."" She added that it appeared the global dominance of the Delta variant had seen other coronavirus variants ""become extinct"". But the public needed to ""stay alert"" as it was ""still very early days of a new virus"".

"People will have to get used to higher food prices, the boss of Kraft Heinz has told the BBC. Miguel Patricio said the international food giant, which makes tomato sauce and baked beans, was putting up prices in several countries. Unlike in previous years, he said, inflation was ""across the board"". The cost of ingredients such as cereals and oils has pushed global food prices to a 10-year high, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation. Kraft Heinz has increased prices on more than half its products in the US, its home market, and Mr Patricio admitted that is happening elsewhere too. ""We are raising prices, where necessary, around the world,"" he said. During the pandemic, many countries saw production of raw materials, ranging from crops to vegetable oils, fall. Measures to control the virus, as well as illness, limited output and delivery. As economies have restarted, the supply of these products hasn't been able to keep up with returning demand, leading to higher prices. Higher wages and energy prices have also added to the burden for manufacturers. Prices in major economies 'to continue to rise' Toy giant warns of higher prices as costs rise What is inflation and why does it matter? Mr Patricio said this broad range of factors was contributing to the rising cost of food. ""Specifically in the UK, with the lack of truck drivers. In [the] US logistic costs also increased substantially, and there's a shortage of labour in certain areas of the economy."" Kraft Heinz chief executive, Miguel Patricio, says consumers need to get used to higher food prices Mr Patricio said that consumers would need to get used to higher food prices, given that the world's population was rising whilst the amount of land on which to grow food was not. In the longer term ""there's a lot to come in technology to improve the effectiveness of farmers"" that will help, he said. Not all cost increases should be passed on to consumers, Mr Patricio said. Firms would have to absorb some of the rise in costs. ""I think it's up to us, and to the industry, and to the other companies, to try to minimise these price increases,"" he said. But big food producers like Kraft Heinz, Nestle and PepsiCo ""will most likely have to pass that cost on to consumers"" according to Kona Haque, head of research at the agricultural commodities firm ED&F Man. ""Whether it's corn, sugar, coffee, soybeans, palm oil, you name it, all of these basic food commodities have been rising,"" she said. ""Poor harvests in Brazil, which is one of the world's biggest agricultural exporters, drought in Russia, reduced planting in the US and stockpiling in China have combined with more expensive fertiliser, energy and shipping costs to push prices up."" But she said food producers would all be affected and would therefore all be raising prices in similar ways: ""because it's so widespread that everyone will do it, meaning they probably won't lose customers"". This weekPespsiCo warned,externalit was also facing rising costs on everything from transport to raw ingredients, and said that further prices rises were likely at the start of next year. However, as well as pushing up costs, the pandemic did help boost sales for some Kraft Heinz brands, Mr Patricio said, because staying in meant ""people are cooking far more than they were before"". Customers in the UK bought more Heinz Baked Beans, while customers in the US bought more Kraft Mac & Cheese. Overall sales rose 1.6% to $13bn in the first half of this year, representing a slight slowdown. The results were described by Erin Lash, at the investment firm Morningstar, as ""still quite impressive relative to the comparable pre-pandemic period in 2019"". The company is also undergoing an extensive restructuring under Mr Patricio, involving selling some old, and buying some new brands, which Ms Lash said was ""narrowing its focus and increasing its spending on innovation and marketing"" which would support future sales. Why even huge ships can't fix the shipping crisis 'We pay $16,000 for shipping - it used to be $2,800' Disruption to shipping could last until Christmas Mr Patricio said the firm was also spending significant sums on developing new packaging to meet its aims on reducing plastic waste. Most of the 650 million bottles of ketchup the firm sells every year are plastic, for example. But Mr Patricio said the firm was ""encouraging"" customers to buy glass bottles even though they are less convenient ""because you have to tap on the bottom"". He added: ""We are working hard, not only on the plastic bottles, but everywhere in our footprint that has plastic."" The pandemic led to a shortage of ketchup sachets as demand for takeaways soared Campaigners against plastic waste would like to see a reduction in the use of single serving sachets. However followinga shortageof sachets during the pandemic, as consumers bought more takeaways from restaurants, Kraft Heinz has invested in expanding production of them by 30%. ""Thanks God we did that, because now we don't have that [shortage] problem anymore"", said Mr Patricio. But he said the company was working on a solution ""to cutting the amount of plastic they use"".

"Abby, not her real name, called the system ""harrowing"" A traumatised domestic abuse victim has said her experience of the justice system was so bad it was ""like the abuse has continued"". Abby, not her real name, branded the system ""harrowing"" and felt she had to ""constantly prove that I'm innocent"". A rape charity said some victims waited years for their cases to reach court. The Ministry of Justice said it had invested hundreds of millions of pounds to ""restore swift access to justice in Wales"". Abby alleges her partner beat her, left her with broken bones, abused her emotionally and controlled her finances. The Crown Prosecution Service decided not to prosecute. Scheme stops abusers writing to victims from jail Bodycam pilot for domestic violence victims Coercive control: Male victims say they aren't believed The experience of pressing charges was ""emotionally draining,"" she said, adding that constantly being asked to recount the abuse was ""traumatic"". She said she felt she had to ""constantly prove that I'm innocent"" ""It was absolutely horrific,"" Abby, from south-west Wales, said. ""I could feel myself shaking because I didn't know what was going to happen. ""Not once have I felt that I've been treated like a survivor, I've felt I've had to constantly prove that I'm innocent,"" she said. ""I don't feel safe. And I don't have the confidence in the courts to put my children's safety first. ""The issue was male violence, not female behaviour, and that needs to be recognised."" Sarah Thomas, of Merthyr Tydfil-based rape charity New Pathways, said delays in getting justice is one of the biggest challenges for survivors. Sarah Thomas, of charity New Pathways, said there were the ""significant"" delays in getting justice ""They feel forgotten, they feel lost in the system, that they're not important, and that the system is set up for their perpetrator,"" she said. She said some women wait three years for their case to get to court, leaving some feeling unable to continue with the case. Gwendolyn Sterk, of Welsh Women's Aid, said she wanted a system that prioritised survivors and implemented restraining orders better. She said many did not report abuse as it was easy for perpetrators to ""continue the harassment of the woman"" during court cases. Victim's Commissioner Dame Vera Baird QC said violent crimes against women and girls were prosecuted ""extraordinarily weakly"" in England and Wales. Dame Vera Baird QC says violent crimes against women are prosecuted ""extraordinarily weakly"" The crime survey for England and Wales, considered an accurate assessment of crimes committed, estimated just 16% of raped or sexually assaulted women report it to police. Home Office figures show just 1.6% of such cases that get to court result in a conviction. Dame Vera said she wanted abuse given the same priority as terrorism. ""There needs to be an urgent, a powerful and a relentless drive to change, not only police attitudes, but criminal justice attitudes and indeed public attitudes,"" she said. In Wales, 22 magistrates' courts have closed and there are currently 17,726 cases outstanding as Covid puts extra pressure on the system. The Magistrates' Association has prioritised cases such as domestic violence where people are in danger, and the courts have been holding remote hearings to clear the Covid-induced backlog. Rape prosecutions have fallen 59% in the last five years. In June the UK government published a plan to improve that. Victims and youth justice shadow minister Anna McMorrin, Labour MP for Cardiff North, said the criminal justice system was failing women and girls ""at every turn"", and labelled it a ""national scandal"". Anna McMorrin has called for cross-party co-operation to improve women and girls' experience with the justice system She called for cross-party co-operation on the issue, and for the Victim's Bill, a proposed law currently being debated in Parliament, to be brought forward. Last week, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said targets to return to 2016 levels of prosecutions would be ""incredibly tough"" to meet. The MoJ said it planned to spend Â£151m on victims, including an extra Â£50m to increase support for victims of rape and domestic abuse. A pilot scheme for rape and sexual violence survivors to have their cross-examinations recorded before trial has also recently been extended. An MoJ spokesman said: ""The impact of the pandemic was vast and unprecedented but we are already cutting backlogs in magistrates' and crown courts across Wales.

"Thirty energy companies have stopped trading in the UK since August 2021, including Bulb, which is being managed separately because of its size. What happens when a supplier goes bust, and what should consumers do? More than four million households have seen their energy firm collapse since the summer, though most suppliers are tiny compared to Bulb. Ofgem automatically moves customers to a new provider, and their supply will continue without interruption. The companies which have gone out of business are: Ampoweruk, Avro, Bluegreen, CNG Energy, Colorado Energy, Daligas, Enstroga, Entice Energy, Goto Energy, Green, Green Network Energy, Hub, Igloo Energy, MA Energy, MoneyPlus, Neon Reef, Omni Energy, Orbit Energy, People's Energy, PFP, Pure Planet, Simplicity, Social Energy Supply, Symbio Energy, Together Energy, Utility Point, Whoop Energy, Xcel Power, Zebra Power and Zog Energy. Firms have struggled because they offered customers cheap fixed deals. That meant they couldn't pass on the cost of soaring gas prices, which have risen dramatically because of a worldwide squeeze on energy supplies. The wholesale price of gas - the price that UK fuel companies pay gas suppliers - has also gone up further because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. How high could my energy bills go? Why are prices rising so quickly? Could the world cope without Russian oil and gas? If your energy provider goes bust, you still receive gas and electricity. Because of its size, Bulbwas put into an arrangement called ""special administration"". The company is being run as normal by administrators Teneo, until a buyer can be found or its customers can be moved elsewhere. In the short-term, it meansBulb customers haven't been been transferred to another provider, and don't have to do anything,external. The accounts held by the other failed firmsare automatically moved to a new supplier by energy regulator Ofgem.,external You can't choose the provider and may end up on a more expensive tariff. Ofgemhas sent customers,externalto the following suppliers: British Gas:Bluegreen Energy Services, MoneyPlus Energy, Neon Reef, People's Energy, PFP Energy, Social Energy Supply, Together Energy and Zebra Power British Gas Evolve: Simplicity Energy EDF:Green Network, Utility Point, Zog Energy Eon:Enstroga, Hub Energy, Igloo and Symbio Octopus:Avro Energy Pozitive Energy:CNG Energy Scottish Power:Entice Energy, Orbit Energy Shell:Colorado Energy, Daligas, Goto Energy, Green, Pure Planet SmartestEnergy:MA Energy Utilita:Omni Energy YÃ¼ Energy:Ampoweruk, Xcel Power, Whoop Energy Ofgem andCitizens Advice,externalboth recommend making a note or taking a photo of your meter reading and downloading any bills, while waiting for your new supplier to get in touch. There's no need to cancel direct debits. If you're in credit, the balance will be added to your account with your new supplier. However, this may take several weeks. If you're in debt to a company which has stopped trading, you still have to pay the money you owe. You will be contacted by its administrators, or the supplier which takes over its business. It's unlikely. Usually, consumers are encouraged to shop around when energy bills rise. But at the moment better offers simply aren't available. In particular, people already on fixed deals are advised to stay put. Those coming to the end of fixed deals will be moved on to higher standard tariffs. A tariff set at the price cap limit - the maximum price suppliers can charge customers on a standard deal - will be the most competitive. Instead of searching for a cheaper deal, the Energy Saving Trust sayssimple changes to our homes and energy habits,externalcould help offset the current price rises. How to save energy at home and help the planet The price cap sets the maximum price suppliers can charge customers on a standard - or default - tariff. The level of the cap is reviewed every six months. It's the reason energy suppliers haven't been able to pass on all of the recent wholesale gas price increases. The energy cap rose sharply in October 2021 and again in April 2022. Ofgem has warned thata typical energy is likely to rise by a further Â£800 in Octoberwhen the cap is next reviewed. After reviewing the cap,the regulator has also proposed that in future the cap should be updated quarterly,externalrather than every six months. The price cap does not apply in Northern Ireland, which has its own energy market, buta number of suppliers there have also announced price increases. How much are energy bills going up?

"Olivier Rousteing's Instagram photo showed injuries he suffered last year, he said Celebrated French fashion designer Olivier Rousteing has revealed he was injured following an accident at his home last year, sharing a picture of himself in heavy bandages. Rousteing, the creative director of fashion house Balmain, shared the news inan Instagram post,externalon Saturday. ""Exactly a year ago, the fireplace inside my house exploded,"" he wrote. He woke the next day at the HÃ´pital Saint Louis in Paris, and has since been recovering from his injuries. Rousteing said his insecurities and fashion's ""obsession with perfection"" had stopped him from revealing all before now. ""To be honest I am not really sure why I was so ashamed,"" he wrote. As he recovered he had hidden his injuries with long sleeves and jewellery during interviews. ""Now, a year later - healed, happy and healthy,"" he wrote. He thanked the medical staff who had treated him despite ""dealing with an incredible number of Covid cases at that same time"", and spoke about how lucky he now felt. ""There is always the sun after the storm."" The designer, pictured here at Paris Fashion Week earlier this month, says he is ""healed, happy and healthy"" Fellow fashion designers, models and other celebrities were among those to offer their support in response to Rousteing's post. The designer Donatella Versace wrote she was ""so glad"" he was safe. ""Let love rule,"" said musician Lenny Kravitz. Kim Kardashian West wrote ""I love you"", while her mother Kris Jenner said she was ""beyond proud"" of Rousteing, adding that his ""message of hope and strength and focus and love will always inspire everyone who you come in contact with"". Rousteing took up his post as Balmain's creative director in 2011 at the age of just 25.According to a profile in Out Magazine,externalthe brand grew between 15% and 20% between 2012 and 2015. He has opened boutiques in London and New York, the company's first outside Paris.

"Mr Airey said he was happy the actor had allowed them to share details of his donation Film star Daniel Craig has donated Â£10,000 to three fathers who have set out on a 300-mile walk to raise funds for a suicide prevention charity after their daughters took their own lives. Andy Airey, Mike Palmer and Tim Owen's ""Three Dads Walking"" trek will see them walk between their homes in Cumbria, Greater Manchester and Norfolk. They are raising money for the Papyrus charity. They said the donation from the James Bond actor was ""amazing"". This video can not be played Three dads united by daughters' suicides take on challenge Mr Airey said he was happy that the actor had let them share the news of his generosity. ""Allowing us to shout about it is fantastic news, especially as he's just about the most famous film actor in the world at the moment, isn't he?"" he said. The trio, who set out earlier, will be walking about 20 miles a day between Mr Airey's home, near Cumbria, Mr Palmer's house in Sale, Greater Manchester, and Mr Owen's property in Shouldham, Norfolk. They expect to complete the challenge on 23 October. Mr Airey, whose 29-year-old daughter Sophie took her own life in 2018, said they had ""three different stories to tell, but each has the same tragic ending; the devastating loss of a daughter to suicide"". ""Daniel Craig has clearly been moved by the indescribable pain we and our families are suffering and wants to help us to bring something positive out of the utter devastation,"" he added. Mr Palmer, whose daughter Beth died in 2020, said being part of the challenge was ""not a club I want to belong to, but [it gives us] an opportunity to fight back and maybe make a difference. ""We hope that by linking our three homes and telling our three daughters' very different stories, we will put a spotlight on young mental health."" As well as fundraising, the trio want to raise awareness of the help and support available Mr Owen added that ""strongly"" believed that ""in a moment of darkness"", his 19-year-old daughter Emily ""made a wrong decision"" last year. ""Had she just taken time to think or to speak to someone, her decision and my family's lives would be on another path,"" he said. ""Instead, she decided she could no longer go on, leaving behind a devastating ripple effect on her family and friends.""

"This video can not be played Kwasi Kwarteng: ""The energy price cap stays"" Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has not committed to any additional government help for businesses struggling amid record gas prices. Some industries have warned firms could be forced to shut down operations. Mr Kwarteng said he was working closely with the chancellor over possible support for energy intensive sectors - but a Treasury source denied this. The business secretary said domestic customers would not see a change to the energy price cap this winter. Asked on BBC One's Andrew Marr programme whether there would be additional government help for energy-intensive companies, Mr Kwarteng described the situation as ""critical"" and said he was ""looking to find a solution"". When Andrew Marr suggested this sounded like a ""yes"" the business secretary said: ""No, it doesn't sound like yes at all. ""We already have existing support and we're looking to see whether that's sufficient to get us through this situation."" Energy price cap: Why are fuel bills rising? What can I do if my energy supplier goes bust? Is the UK headed for a gas shortage this winter? Speaking to Times Radio Mr Kwarteng, who met leaders from heavy industry on Friday, said he was not going to commit to ""any firm figure or subsidy"" for companies. Asked about whether the government would ensure factories would not have to close if they could not pay for gas he said it was a commercial decision and ""up to them"". He added: ""We are not in the business of bail-outs. What we are in the business of is ensuring security of supply and that is what I am focused on."" Wholesale gas prices have risen 250% since January. CEO of British Glass Dave Dalton, who was at Friday's meeting with Mr Kwarteng, said some of the confederation's ""significant"" members were ""teetering on the edge"". ""I think some companies are staring down the ability to survive, absolutely - ultimately that obviously cascades on to jobs and impacts on the consumer,"" he told the BBC. Gareth Stace, director general of UK Steel, said he was frustrated by the lack of action to support businesses. He told the BBC that without help in the next week or so, there would be ""significant and permanent damage to the UK steel sector"". Unite leader Sharon Graham said the country was ""contemplating factory shutdowns across viable manufacturing and businesses"" and that workers were ""worried sick"". Businesses have been shouting louder and louder for support through this period of soaring energy prices. This morning, the business secretary told the BBC he was listening to their concerns - but would not commit to any extra support. Those industries that use a lot of energy for manufacturing say that the time for working out a way forward has long gone. The director general of UK Steel, Gareth Stace, expressed his frustration, saying pauses in steel production will only increase. The government says the current situation emphasises the need for a revolution in how we generate energy, moving towards home-grown renewables. But that's little comfort for those businesses dependent on energy from fossil fuels now, competing with intense demand in a global market. On the Andrew Marr show, Mr Kwarteng denied asking for ""billions"" from the Treasury to subsidise energy-intensive businesses and said supply itself was ""not an issue"". A Treasury source said the business secretary had been ""mistaken"" to say that he had been working on possible support measures with the Chancellor Rishi Sunak. Bridget Phillipson, Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said the government ""needs to get a grip"" and called for ""urgent answers on who exactly is running the show"". ""The two key government departments responsible for the current cost of living crisis have spent this morning infighting about whether they were in talks with each other. What a farce,"" she said. She also accused the government of having ""put its out of office on"", referring to reports that the prime minister is on holiday in Spain. A number of Conservative MPs have called for the government to take action to support heavy industry. The SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford called on the UKgovernment to ""nurse"" businesses through the crisis, describing it as a ""perfect storm"". The domestic consumer energy price cap, which is reviewed every six months, sets the maximum level a supplier can charge a consumer on a standard tariff in England, Wales and Scotland. Mr Kwarteng told Marr that protecting consumers was his ""first and foremost objective"" and as such the price cap would stay at its current level until its next update which is due to in April. Some suppliers say the cap is just delaying an inevitable increase in consumer prices and should be reviewed more regularly. Energy regulator Ofgem has warned households will seefurther ""significant rises"" in the spring, when the cap is reviewed. Asked by Marr if he was sure the lights would stay on this winter, Mr Kwarteng said ""yes, I am"". Due to high gas prices household energy suppliers have been forced to sell gas for less than they can buy it due to the price cap, leading some to fail. Last month, nine domestic energy supply companies went out of business, forcing 1.7 million customers to move to new suppliers and on to higher rates. Paul Richards, chief executive of Together Energy, which he said is currently making losses, said while he supported a price cap to protect customers, the current mechanism ""is not fit for industry, nor is it fit for customers"". He said it protected customers in the short term but somewhere between Â£1bn and Â£3bn in costs would be spread back across business and households as a result of suppliers going bust. The founder of OVO Energy Stephen Fitzpatrick told Marr that it has been ""too easy"" for companies to enter the energy market and that there will be more companies in difficulty. He said the market was a complicated one, and he thought some people had not understood the risks. A LOVE LETTER TO THE NORTH:The Hairy Bikers head to Cumbria and the Lake District!

"Mrs Luttrell was only able to see her husband via a video-link while he was being treated A cancer patient whose wife was told he might not wake from a coma he was put in while being treated for Covid-19 has been called ""a cat with nine lives"" by doctors after making a speedy recovery. Paul Luttrell, who has myeloma cancer, went to Bristol's Southmead Hospital on 27 July and was placed in a coma. His wife Dalma said she was ""very much prepared for the worst"", but the 52-year-old woke after 11 days and left hospital a month after arriving. She said it was ""unbelievable"". Mr Luttrell, from Frome, was sent to the hospital after nurses noticed he was ""very unwell"" and had to put him on oxygen whilst on a routine dialysis visit. ""They put me into an induced coma for 11 days and it took me a week to fully wake up,"" he said. ""When I did, I asked doctors to call Dalma. ""They couldn't believe it."" Mr Luttrell said he hoped his story will show that the dangers of Covid-19 still exist Mrs Luttrell said following conversations with her husband's doctors, she had ""very much prepared for the worst"". She also said the medical team had warned her that as he was in a coma, he would probably need a long recovery time if he survived. However, within two weeks ,she said she ""had a call from him"", adding: ""It was unbelievable."" Mr Luttrell, who had been double vaccinated, said though he had had lucid dreams whilst in the coma of ""terrible things"", after he woke, he could walk ""my stairs at home to go to dialysis"" within a week. He returned home on 26 August. ""My haematologist and doctors said I was a cat with nine lives,"" he said. However, he said he felt lucky to be alive and was worried that about ""people still not taking [coronavirus] seriously"". ""Get vaccinated,"" he said, adding: ""Covid is very real.""
