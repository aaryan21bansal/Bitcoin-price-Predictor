"This video can not be played Mark Drakeford is set to remain as first minister of Wales as his party wins 30 seats in the Senedd Labour is set to stay in power in Wales after matching its best-ever Senedd election result, with exactly half of the 60 seats in the Welsh Parliament. The Tories took the Vale of Clwyd from Labour, and Brecon and Radnorshire from the Liberal Democrats. Labour held firm in other Tory target seats and took Rhondda back from Plaid Cymru. Leader Mark Drakeford, who extended the majority in his seat, vowed to form a ""stable and progressive"" government. With 52 of the 60 seats declared, Labour is on 30 with the Conservatives on 12, Plaid Cymru nine and the Liberal Democrats one. As it happened: Welsh election results day The Welsh election story - in charts It is unlikely Labour will gain further seats when votes for the regional lists in South Wales Central and South Wales East are counted on Saturday, after the party won the lion's share of constituency seats there. Current first minister Mr Drakeford,who raised his majority in his Cardiff West seat by 12.7 points and more than 6,000 votes, told BBC Wales he would ""do whatever I can"" to ensure Wales has a ""stable and progressive"" government. He added he would prefer to be in a position ""where you have a government that is able to command a majority for the action that it needs to take on the floor of the Senedd"". He added: ""Without trying to rush a decision at this time on a Friday we'll take a couple of days to make sure that we make the best decision that we can for Wales."" Allow Twitter content?

Labour also regained Rhondda from Plaid Cymru, toppling its former leader Leanne Wood. Her win there in 2016 was one of the major upsets of the last Senedd election but Labour's Buffy Williams overturned it with a 19% swing and a majority of more than 5,000. Ben Lake, the Plaid Cymru MP for Ceredigion, said losing the Rhondda seat was a ""terrible blow for the party"". Asked if the party could still play a role in a coalition with Labour if required, he said it was a ""dead duck"". ""The people of Wales have sent a very clear message at the election, and I can't see it being feasible or indeed desirable on the part of either party,"" he toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfast. Plaid Cymru has won five constituency seats, holding on to Arfon, Dwyfor Meirionnydd, Ynys Mon, Ceredigion, and Carmarthen East and Dinefwr. With three of the five regional list results declared so far, Plaid has won four list seats, the Conservatives four, Labour three and the Liberal Democrats one. The Conservatives held on to Montgomeryshire, Aberconwy, Clwyd West, Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire, and Preseli Pembrokeshire. The party also kept Monmouth where ex-Monmouthshire council leader Peter Fox is its new incumbent following the deselection of Nick Ramsay. But the Tories failed to capture the Vale of Glamorgan, another Labour-held target seat which is Conservative at Westminster.

The Labour seats of Alyn and Deeside, Gower, Swansea East, Swansea West, Neath, Aberavon, Ogmore, Bridgend, Cynon Valley, Pontypridd, Cardiff Central, Cardiff North, Cardiff South and Penarth, Cardiff West, Caerphilly, Islwyn, Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney, Newport East, Newport West and Torfaen have also remained red. Labour also held on to the Plaid Cymru target seat of Llanelli, with Welsh government deputy transport minister Lee Waters being re-elected. Following his victory, Mr Waters said Mark Drakeford was ""definitely an asset"", due to his leadership during the pandemic. ""He may not be flashy, he may be a bit nerdy, a bit boring, he's a university professor, but thank God for him,"" he said. Health Minister Vaughan Gething also paid tribute to his party leader, saying: ""The recognition of the way Mark has run the Welsh government in this extraordinary time was undoubtedly a factor in the way that people have voted."" How to organise an election in a pandemic A really simple guide to the Welsh elections Five things to find out from the Welsh election Despite the challenges of the pandemic, more than 1.1 million people voted, making it the highest-ever turnout for a Senedd election at 46.6%. This beat the previous record of 46.3% at the first Senedd election in 1999, but is still significantly lower than turnout for general elections. Laura McAllister, professor of public policy at Cardiff University, said Labour had ""performed better than most people expected"". ""After 22 years in power, with a Conservative Party that was really strongly tipped to make significant breakthroughs, and of course Plaid Cymru biting its ankles as well, that's some achievement."" Political commentator Prof Roger Awan-Scully said: ""I think it's been an astonishingly resilient performance by the Welsh Labour Party, amidst disasters for Labour elsewhere in the UK. ""The Conservatives are also performing strongly, but not quite bringing it home in terms of the number of constituency victories that they might have expected. ""For Plaid Cymru I think this has to be said to be a deeply disappointing election."" Gareth Davies thanked voters for their trust in him The Vale of Clwyd was the only Conservative gain in Labour's ""red wall"" of seats in north Wales where the Tories had enjoyed success in the 2019 General Election. Winning candidate Gareth Davies, an NHS physiotherapist, said: ""It's a magnificent achievement. ""In 1999 I was a small boy, and now I'm in my 30s and I never thought back then I'd ever be in this position. So I feel really humbled."" Andrew RT Davies, leader of the Tories in the Senedd, said the result in the Vale of Clwyd was ""fantastic"". North Wales has been a fiercely contested battleground, with re-elected Aberconwy Tory MS Janet Finch-Saunders sayingshe had been ""horrified""by personal attacks which had hurt her family during the campaign. Labour's win in Alyn and Deeside represents the last of the red wall seats that the Conservatives had hoped to take in north east Wales. It's the last brick in the wall. But they have only managed in this election to take Vale of Clwyd in that region - by a small amount. So it counts as a disappointing set of results for the Conservatives. Labour, which has been in charge of the Welsh government for 22 years, is now set to remain in power for a sixth term with exactly half the seats in the Senedd chamber. Of the 60 members of the Senedd (MSs) being elected, 40 will serve constituencies and 20 will be elected to represent larger regional areas of North Wales, Mid and West Wales, South Wales West, South Wales Central and South Wales East. A party needs to win 31 seats to claim a majority but it has never happened, with Labour last time having 29 seats. It previously won 30 seats in 2003 and 2011. Social distancing and other Covid measures have delayed the count in many areas For Plaid Cymru, the party's Westminster leader Liz Saville Roberts painted a gloomy picture for their hopes of making inroads into Labour's grip on the south Wales valleys. She said the pandemic had meant ""ministers in the governments, both in Westminster and Cardiff, have had an immense platform over the last year"". It had been an ""extraordinarily different"" election, Ms Saville Roberts said, ""to anything that anybody has been used to, and it's been difficult for a party like Plaid to get the same sort of platform"". ""At the same time there's a real sense that our policy, our offer of policies, has offered something that was progressive and new and is, I hope, really the seeds for something in the future,"" she added. Adam Price, who held Carmarthen East and Dinefwr with a reduced majority, said he would not stand down as Plaid Cymru leader. Adam Price was re-elected in Carmarthen East and Dinefwr but saw his majority fall Despite no gains, Mr Price said the party had increased its share of the vote and its stance on independence had been a ""net positive"". ""I'm not walking away from anything, because this is the moment when Wales needs leadership,"" he said. ""This is a historic challenge, because of the way that the politics is moving in this island, but it's also a historic opportunity for us. ""We can move our nation forward and I'm looking forward to playing my part, it's not something that anyone can do on their own. ""I have a role to play, we all have a role to play and that's what's exciting about politics at the moment. Wales is on the move Wales is on the march. I'm going to be part of that.""

Eg 'W1A 1AA' or 'Westminster'   Meanwhile, the Welsh Liberal Democrats lost their constituency seat in Brecon and Radnorshire but won a list seat in Mid and West Wales with party leader Jane Dodds heading for the Senedd. Liberal Democrat peer Baroness Jenny Randerson said she did not think Welsh Labour would need the support of Ms Dodds to run a government as had happened with her predecessor, former Education Minister Kirsty Williams who stood down prior to the elections. ""I think Labour will have the numbers to just about manage on their own,"" said Baroness Randerson. Ian Price, director of CBI Wales, congratulated Labour. ""This is a critical time for the Welsh economy and the new parliament must have a laser-like focus on rebuilding from the devastating impact of the pandemic,"" he said. ""That means all parties pulling together and working with business to protect jobs, rebuild livelihoods and create a fair and sustainable recovery that addresses the longstanding structural challenges our economy faces."" The Abolish the Welsh Assembly Party was also hoping to make a breakthrough in the regional lists. Voting also took place for four police and crime commissioners, with those votes to be counted on Sunday. POSTCODE SEARCH:What are the results in your area?

"The vaccine has already been given to millions of people The World Health Organization (WHO) has granted emergency approval for a Covid vaccine made by Chinese state-owned company Sinopharm. It is the first vaccine developed by a non-Western country to get WHO backing. The vaccine has already been given to millions of people in China and elsewhere. The WHO had previously only approved the vaccines made by Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson and Moderna. But individual health regulators in various countries - especially poorer ones in Africa, Latin America and Asia - have approved Chinese jabs for emergency use. With little data released internationally early on, the effectiveness of the various Chinese vaccines has long been uncertain. But the WHO on Friday said it had validated the ""safety, efficacy and quality"" of the Sinopharm jab developed by the Beijing Institute of Biological Products. The WHO said the addition of the vaccine had ""the potential to rapidly accelerate Covid-19 vaccine access for countries seeking to protect health workers and populations at risk"". It is recommending that the vaccine be administered in two doses to those aged 18 and over. A decision is expected in the coming days on another Chinese vaccine developed by Sinovac, while Russia's Sputnik vaccine is under assessment. The green light from the global health body is a guideline for national regulators that a vaccine is safe and effective. WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said it would give countries ""confidence to expedite their own regulatory approval"". It also means that the vaccine can be used in the global Covax programme, which was set up last year to try to ensure fair access to vaccines among rich and poor nations. The decision to list the Chinese vaccine for emergency use is expected to give a substantial boost to the scheme, which has been struggling with supply problems. How will Covid vaccines be shared around the world? How many people have been vaccinated so far? Indians' desperate wait for Covid jab to get longer Prior to the WHO approval, the Sinopharm vaccine was already being widely used, with an estimated 65 million doses administered, according to reports. In addition to China, countries already using the vaccine include the UAE, Pakistan and Hungary. The decision on Friday to approve the vaccine for emergency use was made by the WHO's technical advisory group, which reviewed the latest clinical data and manufacturing practices. It said the vaccine's efficacy for symptomatic and hospitalised cases of Covid-19 was estimated to be 79%. The WHO noted that few adults over the age of 60 were included in clinical trials, so efficacy could not be estimated for this age group. But it said there was no reason to think that the vaccine would act differently in older recipients. The health body is yet to reach a decision on China's Sinovac vaccine. WHO experts on Friday said they were awaiting additional information before they could make a recommendation. Millions of doses of that vaccine have also already been shipped to a number of countries, which have permitted its emergency usage. This video can not be played What do we know about the Chinese vaccines? One of the Chinese vaccines' main advantages is that they can be stored in a standard refrigerator at 2-8 degrees Celsius, like the AstraZeneca vaccine. The WHO said these ""easy storage requirements"" made the Sinopharm vaccine ""highly suitable for low-resource settings"". The two Chinese vaccines differ significantly from some of the other Covid vaccines currently in use, especially those by Pfizer and Moderna. Developed in a more traditional way, they are so-called inactivated vaccines, which means they use killed viral particles to expose the immune system to the virus without risking a serious disease response. What's it like in the best place to live during Covid? Your top questions about India's Covid crisis answered By comparison, the BioNtech/Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are mRNA vaccines. This means part of the coronavirus' genetic code is injected into the body, training the immune system how to respond to it. The UK's AstraZeneca vaccine is yet another type of vaccine where a version of a common cold virus from chimpanzees is modified to contain genetic material shared by the coronavirus. Once injected, it teaches the immune system how to fight the real virus. BioNTech/Pfizer and Moderna have an efficacy rate of around 90% or higher, while the AstraZeneca jab is thought to be around 76%. In April,China's top disease control official said the efficacy of the country's Covid vaccines was low, although he later insisted his comments had been misinterpreted.

"The inquiry was launched in 2018 into a payment made to Stormy Daniels (pictured) An inquiry into whether Donald Trump violated campaign financial law during the 2016 election has been dropped. The case stemmed from an allegation that Mr Trump directed his former lawyer to pay Stormy Daniels, an adult film actress, to stop her speaking out about an alleged affair. The lawyer, Michael Cohen, was later jailed on multiple charges. The regulatory agency tasked with enforcing campaign finance law announced the case closure Thursday. It came after the Federal Election Commission (FEC), which is split evenly between Democrats and Republicans, became deadlocked on taking action at a closed-door meeting in February. The vote came months after an internal report recommended that there was ""reason to believe"" Mr Trump's campaign had knowingly violated campaign finance law. Trump's legal battles: How six cases may play out Two Republicans who voted to dismiss the case said they had concluded it would not be ""the best use of agency resources"" while two Democrat-aligned commissioners criticised their decision. ""To conclude that a payment, made 13 days before Election Day to hush up a suddenly newsworthy 10-year-old story, was not campaign-related, without so much as conducting an investigation, defies reality,"" they wrote in a letter. Cohen previously testified under oath that Mr Trump had directed him to make the payment of $130,000 (Â£100,000) just days before the election. Mr Trump has acknowledged reimbursing the payment but denied the affair and any wrongdoing regarding campaign laws. This video can not be played Five things Cohen said about Trump ""The hush money payment was done at the direction of and for the benefit of Donald J. Trump,""Cohen said in a statement to The New York Times,external, responding to the case dismissal. ""Like me, Trump should have been found guilty. How the FEC committee could rule any other way is confounding."" In a statement issued through his website, Mr Trump thanked the commission for dropping what he described as a ""phony case against me...built on lies from Michael Cohen, a corrupt and convicted lawyer"". Cohen, who once said he would take a bullet for Mr Trump, was given a three-year prison sentence after pleading guilty to multiple offences in 2018, including violating campaign finance laws and lying to Congress. Legal wrangling over the allegations involving Ms Daniels, who alleges she had sex with Mr Trump in 2006, were ongoing throughout the Trump presidency.

"This video can not be played Grant Shapps on the green list destinations: ""This is just a first step"" Twelve destinations have been put on a green travel list for people in England, meaning anyone returning will not need to quarantine from 17 May. A new traffic light system of rules means international travel will no longer be illegal. However, places on the green list - which includes Portugal, Israel and Gibraltar - have their own restrictions on who can visit from abroad. The transport secretary said the UK approach was ""necessarily cautious"". But the travel industry has said it is too cautious and called it a reopening of air travel ""in name only"". Turkey, the Maldives and Nepal will be added to England's red list of countries from 04:00 BST on Wednesday 12 May, meaning travellers from those destinations will have to quarantine in a hotel for 10 days on their return. The biggest group is the amber list - which includes popular European destinations such as Spain, Italy and France. People returning from those countries have to isolate from home for at least five days - but Mr Shapps said no-one should be travelling to those destinations at the moment. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have not said when they might ease their strict travel restrictions, but Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said all four of the UK's chief medical officers agreed on the principles behind the traffic light system. Which countries are on the green list? What are my refund rights for foreign holidays? Travel firms reject 'overly cautious' green list Speaking at a Downing Street briefing, Mr Shapps said the changes were a ""tentative"" first step to opening up travel, as there remained ""concern about the resurgence of Covid"". Mr Shapps said the ""success in combating Covid"" in the UK was ""not yet replicated in many places abroad"". ""We must make sure the countries we reconnect with are safe,"" he added. Covid tests will be required before and after travel. The long-awaited restart of international travel is less throwing open the doors, more opening them a crack. That's a deliberate decision by the government, which is hoping to reassure those who are nervous about opening the country's borders while also giving a small concession to the travel industry. Some in the industry are not impressed, calling the list a ""missed opportunity"". Many of the transport secretary's comments - he dissuaded passengers from travelling to amber countries and warned them to expect queues at the border - will be seen as trying to dampen down demand, just at the moment when the industry was hoping to start to ramp up. Ultimately, the real test will be in a few weeks' time when the government will announce the green list for June. The industry will be hoping it's a little longer than this list. Mr Shapps said people looking to travel overseas should check any restrictions that apply to new arrivals, and not book trips which do not include a refund should the Covid situation change. Countries on the green, amber and red lists would be reviewed every three weeks from 17 May, he added. Spain's ministry of tourism said the decision had no immediate effect with restrictions still in place for non-essential travel from the UK. But a spokesperson said Madrid ""reiterates its conviction that this summer it will be possible for British citizens to spend their holidays in Spain"" and it predicts that in June ""we will be able to start the reactivation of international travel"". This video can not be played ""No-one enjoys a holiday more"": A restaurant owner in Portugal is excited to welcome back tourists from England The travel industry has been largely critical, with Airlines UK calling the move a missed opportunity and ""a reopening of air travel in name only"" which leaves the UK ""at risk of falling behind"". Andrew Flintham, managing director of holiday firm Tui, said it was ""an overly cautious start"". Easyjet chief executive Johan Lundgren said: ""The decision to put so few European countries into the green tier is simply not justified by the data or the science and is inconsistent with the approach to reopen the domestic economy."" Travellers have also been warned of queues at the UK border when they return. Border Force director Paul Lincoln said the increased delays would be at each stage of their journeys, with staff required to check ""100%"" of all travellers coming through. Red list countries have the strictest rules, with only UK or Irish nationals and UK residents allowed to return. They must pay for a 10-day stay in a government-approved quarantine hotel. Asked what Turkey being added to the red list means for the Champions League final between Manchester City and Chelsea in Istanbul, Mr Shapps said fans should not travel to Turkey. He added that the Football Association is in discussions with European football's governing body UEFA about the UK hosting the final.

"Nicola Sturgeon easily saw off a challenge from Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar in her Glasgow Southside constituency The SNP has won three key seats but its hopes of securing an overall majority in the Scottish Parliament election remain on a knife edge. The party has taken both Edinburgh Central - where former MP Angus Robertson was standing for the SNP - and Ayr from the Conservatives. It also won the East Lothian seat from Labour. But it fell short in other targets, with counting in the remaining seats due to resume on Saturday. No other constituencies have changed hands so far, with the SNP currently on 39 seats, the Liberal Democrats four, Tories two and Labour one. But the opposition parties will see their number of seats increase dramatically once the regional list results are finalised on Saturday. The story of the Scottish election so far Scottish election results in maps and charts Full details of the results from across Scotland,external Polling expert Prof Sir John Curtice said it was now unlikely, but not impossible, that the SNP would achieve an overall majority in the new Holyrood parliament. And he said there were clear signs that tactical voting by pro-UK voters in some parts of the country had been successful. The Alba Party, which was founded by former first minister and SNP leader Alex Salmond, looks unlikely to win any seats. Click or tap to explore results A modern browser with JavaScript and a stable internet connection is required to view this interactive. As the count resumed on Saturday, Aberdeenshire East was first to declare with the SNP's Gillian Martin holding her seat with a reduced majority of 1,889 over the Scottish Conservatives - who increased their vote share by 11%. Friday's results included First Minister Nicola Sturgeon - the SNP leader - easily holding off a challenge from Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar in her Glasgow Southside constituency. Ms Sturgeon won by 9,456 votes, only marginally lower than the 9,593 she won by in 2016. Turnout has been higher than anticipated in many areas, with the SNP's share of the vote falling in many of the early constituencies to declare but increasing in others. The A-Z of Scotland's constituencies,external When will we know the result of the Scottish election? BBC Scotland election results coverage When will my seat declare? Ms Sturgeon said that the SNP ""appears to be on course for a fourth consecutive election victory and to be on course to have the privilege of forming a government again"". She pledged to ""get back to work immediately"" and lead the country's Covid recovery. ""And then, when the time is right, to offer this country the choice of a better future,"" she added. It comes as UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson suggested he would reject any calls for a second independence referendum, saying it would be ""irresponsible and reckless"" right now. Asked if an SNP majority would mean there was a mandate for another vote, he toldthe Daily Telegraph,external: ""I think that count is still taking place and we'll have to see what happens. I listened to the Scottish election carefully. My impression was that they [the SNP] moved away from the idea of a referendum, and I think very wisely. ""I don't think this is anything like the time to have more constitutional wrangling, to be talking about ripping our country apart, when actually people want to heal our economy and bounce forward together. That's what people want."" John Swinney told BBC Breakfast he was 'confident' there would be a pro-independence majority However deputy first minister John Swinney toldBBC Breakfastthat his party would legislate for a second referendum if Mr Johnson were to block one. He said: ""We've said we will take forward legislation to have a legal referendum - we already have put in place some of the legislative arrangements for that process. We will embark on such an agenda should there be a majority for such a proposition in the Scottish Parliament."" Mr Swinney said that although he was waiting to see the ""electoral arithmetic"" of the final results, he was ""very confident"" there would be a majority of candidates ""elected on a programme to deliver a referendum on independence"". This election has a long way to go with a further 26 constituencies and all 56 regional list seats still to declare. While the SNP is on course to finish as the largest party, there are only limited opportunities left for them to do so with an overall majority. To achieve that they really need to hold all they have and pick up an additional constituency seat like Aberdeenshire West, where the Conservatives are defending a majority of 900 votes. There is also a possible pathway if they do better than expected on the regional lists which are very hard to predict because of the proportional voting system. If the SNP fall short of that outright majority they could enter a fourth term in office as a minority government (as they are now) or seek a more formal arrangement with another party - most likely the Greens. Together the SNP and the Greens will almost certainly have a pro-independence majority at Holyrood - committed to holding another referendum that the UK government seems determined to resist. A big wrangle over indyref2 is coming and it could end up in the UK Supreme Court. The constituencies that declared on Friday included eight of the SNP's top 10 target seats. The Conservatives held Dumfriesshire, which had been one of the SNP's goals, with Oliver Mundell increasing his majority, while Jackson Carlaw held the marginal Eastwood seat for the Tories from the SNP. And Labour's Daniel Johnson held off the SNP challenge in Edinburgh Southern and the party's deputy leader Jackie Baillie increased her majority over the SNP in Dumbarton. Labour increase majority in Dumbarton Jackson suspended over Yousaf confrontation Salmond says Alba may not win any seats Robertson takes Davidson's former seat The election is seen as being crucial to the future of the UK as the result could impact on whether or not there is a second referendum on Scottish independence. The SNP - which has formed the devolved Scottish government since 2007 -  will once again finish as the largest party, but is seeking to win an overall majority to strengthen the case for indyref2. Although it is not yet clear that it will win a majority by itself, there is likely to be a pro-independence majority in the parliament once the Scottish Greens are allocated regional list seats on Saturday.

"Portugal is one of just four European countries on the green list The travel industry has expressed disappointment that so few countries areon the UK government's green list for travel,describing the announcement as ""overly cautious"". The traffic light system means travel abroad from 17 May will not be illegal. The 12 green list countries, which include Portugal, Gibraltar and Israel, will not require people to quarantine on return to England. Firms said leaving the US off the list would risk the UK ""falling behind"". Travel to amber or red lists countries is not advised. The change in travel rules applies to England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have not said when they might ease their strict travel rules. Only four of the countries on the green list are in Europe, and Portugal is the only large holiday destination from the continent on the list. Israel and Singapore are also included, but Australia and New Zealand - which are approved as safe by the UK government - are not currently allowing in visitors from abroad. France, Greece, Italy and Spain, normally hugely popular holiday destinations for UK travellers, are not included on the safe list. NI ministers urged to relax Covid travel rules Portugal and Israel on quarantine-free list Which countries are on the green list? What are my refund rights for foreign holidays? Andrew Flintham, managing director of holiday firm TUI, said: ""While we were expecting to see just a handful of destinations on the green list, this is an overly cautious start."" Airlines UK, representing UK carriers, described it as ""a missed opportunity"" and ""a reopening of air travel in name only"" which left the UK ""at risk of falling behind"". And Easyjet chief executive Johan Lundgren said: ""The decision to put so few European countries into the green tier is simply not justified by the data or the science, and is inconsistent with the approach to reopen the domestic economy."" UK citizens risked missing out on bookings for hotels if other European tourists were permitted to travel, he added. Making the announcement, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the easing of restrictions was ""necessarily cautious"" in the light of the threat from new variants of Covid-19. He said the UK's success in combating the virus was not matched in many other countries. However he said the list would be reviewed every three weeks by the Joint Biosecurity Centre - the team set up last year to monitor the threat from the virus. Some firms had hoped the rapid roll out of the vaccination programme in the US would allow summer travel to resume there more quickly. ""There is no reason for the US to be absent from the green list. This overly cautious approach fails to reap the benefits of the UK's successful vaccination programme,"" a spokesperson for Virgin Atlantic - one of the airlines which relies heavily on UK-US traffic - said. ""A transatlantic travel corridor is vital to deliver a much-needed boost to economic recovery,"" the spokesperson added. But British Airways predicted that more countries would be included before the summer. ""What's clear is that with high levels of vaccination in the UK being matched by other countries, we should see more destinations going 'green' before the end of June,"" BA chief executive Sean Doyle said. ""We cannot stress more greatly that the UK urgently needs travel between it and other low-risk countries like the US, to re-start the economy, support devastated industries and reunite loved ones."" Meanwhile, Ryanair, Easyjet, Tui and British Airways all said they would be increasing their flights to Portugal and other destinations on the green list. Tourist-dependent firms in Portugal were quick to welcome the news. ""No-one enjoys a holiday more than the British people,"" said Miguel Campino, owner of Maria's Restaurant - a beach venue on Praia do GarrÃ£o Poente. ""They bring a colourful atmosphere to all the restaurants, bars and hotels. This is a happy moment for everyone, for Portugal, for England... it's great news."" This video can not be played ""No-one enjoys a holiday more"": A restaurant owner in Portugal is excited to welcome back tourists from England JoÃ£o Fernandes, president of the Algarve Tourism Bureau, also said the region was ready to welcome UK visitors back. ""We are obviously delighted with the news,"" he said. ""It's a recognition of the remarkable work Portugal has done in reducing levels of Covid to be able to restart the economy safely."" It comes as ministers continue talks with Uefa about holding theChampions League final between Chelsea and Manchester Cityin the UK, after host nation Turkey was added to England's travel red list. From 04:00 BST on Wednesday 12 May, travellers from Turkey, as well as those from the Maldives and Nepal,will have to quarantine in a hotel for 10 days on their return. Environment Secretary George Eustice told BBC Breakfast that the UK had offered to host the match but that it would ""ultimately be a decision for Uefa"". However, the UK consumer body Which? warned that practical difficulties over taking a holiday abroad would remain. ""Travellers will have an expectation that these new government rules should protect their health and their money, yet serious issues around lengthy airport queues and a broken testing system remain unresolved,"" Rory Boland, editor of Which? Travel, said. VACCINE:When will I get the jab? GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? NEW VARIANTS:How worried should we be? QUARANTINE:Will I need to self-isolate in a hotel? Although international travel has been heavily restricted since January, returning travellers have experienced long delays at border control when arriving at Heathrow, sometimes waiting for up to six hours. Private firms offering Covid tests to returning travellers have been criticised for failing to deliver tests and results on time. ""Travellers should also be aware that there is still some financial risk involved in booking travel plans, depending on how you book and which company you choose,"" said Mr Boland. ""In a summer when further disruption can be expected, travel companies must be honest about the risks holidaymakers may be taking on. Crucially, holidaymakers also need to do their research before booking, as choosing the right provider could be the difference between getting hundreds of pounds back or just getting the run-round."" A further 15 deaths in the UK within 28 days of a positive test were reported on Friday, bringing the total to 127,598. There were 2,490 new cases. More than 35 million first doses of a coronavirus vaccine have been given and more than 16.7 million second doses.

"The newly identified Omicron variant of Covid has led to more disruption for international travellers. Quarantine is being reintroduced for people arriving from some African countries, flights have been cancelled and PCR tests will be mandatory within 48 hours of arrival to the UK from 30 November. If the government announces that travel to a particular country is not advised, then airlines and travel companies are likely to cancel any pre-booked flights or holidays there. For example, that is already the case for some flights to and from South Africa as a result of risks associated with the Omicron variant. What are the UK's new travel rules? If your flight is cancelled, you are entitled to a full refund and you can choose to receive that refund in cash rather than as a voucher. An airline should refund the money within seven days, although some people have waited longer. A package holiday should be refunded, in full, within 14 days. This is far less clear-cut. If you cancel, rather than your travel provider, then you have no automatic right to a refund. In this situation, it is worth contacting the airline/holiday provider to see what options you have. EasyJet, for example, has announced that it will extend its ""freedom to change"" service - which allows passengers to change flights up to two hours before departure for free  - until 31 March, 2022. Some may charge a fee to transfer to another date or destination, but some may allow it without charging a fee. You would have to pay the difference if the alternative flight is more expensive. They may give you a voucher, or they may allow you to cancel and get a refund. That may be trickier, according to Rory Boland, travel editor at Which? who said that the property's specific policy will determine whether refunds would be given. ""If your trip is several weeks or months away, travellers should at this stage do nothing as the situation may change,"" he said. ""Those booking a trip should do so through holiday providers with good, flexible booking policies in case it cannot go ahead."" People who have booked a package holiday will be refunded in full, including accommodation, if it is cancelled by the operator. Operators do not have to refund you if you are unexpectedly forced to self-isolate. It is best to study their policies before booking, or see whether they can offer some support if you have already booked and want to cancel. Travel insurers are offering different levels of cover. In part, this depends on how much you pay for a policy. The majority, but not all, will pay out if you test positive for Covid and have to cancel before you travel. Importantly, if the Foreign Office advises against travel to a country - as it is for some in southern Africa at the moment, then all but a handful of travel insurance policies would be invalid if you still decide to go. Rules are inevitably going to be complex, given the risk of Covid varies so much between countries. The government haspublished a charter,externalthat ""clearly sets out consumer rights and responsibilities when booking travel while Covid-19 measures remain in place"". It says it expects travel operators to be ""flexible"" with customers, given the circumstances, and theCompetition and Markets Authority (CMA) has warned package holiday firmsthey must stick to refund rules. â¨ How are travel rules being relaxed?

"This video can not be played Grant Shapps on the green list destinations: ""This is just a first step"" Twelve destinations have been put on a green travel list for people in England, meaning anyone returning will not need to quarantine from 17 May. A new traffic light system of rules means international travel will no longer be illegal. However, places on the green list - which includes Portugal, Israel and Gibraltar - have their own restrictions on who can visit from abroad. The transport secretary said the UK approach was ""necessarily cautious"". But the travel industry has said it is too cautious and called it a reopening of air travel ""in name only"". Turkey, the Maldives and Nepal will be added to England's red list of countries from 04:00 BST on Wednesday 12 May, meaning travellers from those destinations will have to quarantine in a hotel for 10 days on their return. The biggest group is the amber list - which includes popular European destinations such as Spain, Italy and France. People returning from those countries have to isolate from home for at least five days - but Mr Shapps said no-one should be travelling to those destinations at the moment. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have not said when they might ease their strict travel restrictions, but Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said all four of the UK's chief medical officers agreed on the principles behind the traffic light system. Which countries are on the green list? What are my refund rights for foreign holidays? Travel firms reject 'overly cautious' green list Speaking at a Downing Street briefing, Mr Shapps said the changes were a ""tentative"" first step to opening up travel, as there remained ""concern about the resurgence of Covid"". Mr Shapps said the ""success in combating Covid"" in the UK was ""not yet replicated in many places abroad"". ""We must make sure the countries we reconnect with are safe,"" he added. Covid tests will be required before and after travel. The long-awaited restart of international travel is less throwing open the doors, more opening them a crack. That's a deliberate decision by the government, which is hoping to reassure those who are nervous about opening the country's borders while also giving a small concession to the travel industry. Some in the industry are not impressed, calling the list a ""missed opportunity"". Many of the transport secretary's comments - he dissuaded passengers from travelling to amber countries and warned them to expect queues at the border - will be seen as trying to dampen down demand, just at the moment when the industry was hoping to start to ramp up. Ultimately, the real test will be in a few weeks' time when the government will announce the green list for June. The industry will be hoping it's a little longer than this list. Mr Shapps said people looking to travel overseas should check any restrictions that apply to new arrivals, and not book trips which do not include a refund should the Covid situation change. Countries on the green, amber and red lists would be reviewed every three weeks from 17 May, he added. Spain's ministry of tourism said the decision had no immediate effect with restrictions still in place for non-essential travel from the UK. But a spokesperson said Madrid ""reiterates its conviction that this summer it will be possible for British citizens to spend their holidays in Spain"" and it predicts that in June ""we will be able to start the reactivation of international travel"". This video can not be played ""No-one enjoys a holiday more"": A restaurant owner in Portugal is excited to welcome back tourists from England The travel industry has been largely critical, with Airlines UK calling the move a missed opportunity and ""a reopening of air travel in name only"" which leaves the UK ""at risk of falling behind"".

Easyjet chief executive Johan Lundgren said: ""The decision to put so few European countries into the green tier is simply not justified by the data or the science and is inconsistent with the approach to reopen the domestic economy."" Travellers have also been warned of queues at the UK border when they return. Border Force director Paul Lincoln said the increased delays would be at each stage of their journeys, with staff required to check ""100%"" of all travellers coming through. Red list countries have the strictest rules, with only UK or Irish nationals and UK residents allowed to return. They must pay for a 10-day stay in a government-approved quarantine hotel. Asked what Turkey being added to the red list means for the Champions League final between Manchester City and Chelsea in Istanbul, Mr Shapps said fans should not travel to Turkey. He added that the Football Association is in discussions with European football's governing body UEFA about the UK hosting the final.

"The vaccination of younger adults in Moray is to be accelerated because of the coronavirus surge in the area. NHS Grampian has announced appointments will start being given from Saturday to those between 18 and 39 who have not already been vaccinated. Health officials are urging everyone in Moray to take up asymptomatic testing in a bid to combat the recent spread. They are also considering the introduction of door-to-door testing in Elgin. Moray is experiencing what is being described as ""uncontrolled, sustained community transmission"" of Covid-19. Covid spread in Moray is 'uncontrolled' The region currently has an infection rate of more than 81 cases per 100,000 - four times the Scotland-wide level. Katrina Morrison, the clinical lead nurse for the vaccination programme, said additional stocks and the sustained community transmission in Moray had made the decision ""straightforward"". She said: ""It needs to happen quickly and our staff have been mobilised to speed up the process. ""During the first few days, we will phone to offer appointments before moving to letter appointments from the middle of next week. You may not recognise the number or the number may be withheld.  Check your voicemails regularly. ""Working together to reduce the spread in Moray will reduce the risk of further spread to Aberdeenshire and Aberdeen."" Allow Twitter content?

"The inquiry was launched in 2018 into a payment made to Stormy Daniels (pictured) An inquiry into whether Donald Trump violated campaign financial law during the 2016 election has been dropped. The case stemmed from an allegation that Mr Trump directed his former lawyer to pay Stormy Daniels, an adult film actress, to stop her speaking out about an alleged affair. The lawyer, Michael Cohen, was later jailed on multiple charges. The regulatory agency tasked with enforcing campaign finance law announced the case closure Thursday. It came after the Federal Election Commission (FEC), which is split evenly between Democrats and Republicans, became deadlocked on taking action at a closed-door meeting in February. The vote came months after an internal report recommended that there was ""reason to believe"" Mr Trump's campaign had knowingly violated campaign finance law. Trump's legal battles: How six cases may play out Two Republicans who voted to dismiss the case said they had concluded it would not be ""the best use of agency resources"" while two Democrat-aligned commissioners criticised their decision. ""To conclude that a payment, made 13 days before Election Day to hush up a suddenly newsworthy 10-year-old story, was not campaign-related, without so much as conducting an investigation, defies reality,"" they wrote in a letter. Cohen previously testified under oath that Mr Trump had directed him to make the payment of $130,000 (Â£100,000) just days before the election. Mr Trump has acknowledged reimbursing the payment but denied the affair and any wrongdoing regarding campaign laws. This video can not be played Five things Cohen said about Trump ""The hush money payment was done at the direction of and for the benefit of Donald J. Trump,""Cohen said in a statement to The New York Times,external, responding to the case dismissal. ""Like me, Trump should have been found guilty. How the FEC committee could rule any other way is confounding."" In a statement issued through his website, Mr Trump thanked the commission for dropping what he described as a ""phony case against me...built on lies from Michael Cohen, a corrupt and convicted lawyer"". Cohen, who once said he would take a bullet for Mr Trump, was given a three-year prison sentence after pleading guilty to multiple offences in 2018, including violating campaign finance laws and lying to Congress. Legal wrangling over the allegations involving Ms Daniels, who alleges she had sex with Mr Trump in 2006, were ongoing throughout the Trump presidency.

"Johannah, 5, was visiting her grandparents in Kerala state when the pandemic saw borders closed and flights cancelled Dilin was unable to hold back his emotions when he talked about his young daughter, who he has not seen since November 2019. ""I can certainly see the sorrow in her heartâ¦ she truly misses us,"" he told an Australian Senate committee on Friday. Johannah, 5, is one of at least 173 unaccompanied children who are stuck in India trying to return to Australia. She was staying with her grandparents when the pandemic struck and borders were closed. Johannah's parents tried to get her on government organised flights to Sydney but children younger than 14 are not allowed to travel alone on the repatriation trips. Qantas, which operates flights between India and Australia, also does not allow unaccompanied minors, so the couple's only other option is to charter a private plane or fly with Air India. However, until recently Johannah was still too young. Drisya and Dilin did not risk trying to fly back to India to be with Johannah because of the limited flights to return to Australia from there. The coupled feared they would join the 9,000 people in India struggling to get home to Australia. Australia to resume some India flights after backlash Why can't Australians get back into their country? Drisya and Dilin were finally able to get Johannah a seat on a chartered plane from Bangalore to Sydney, with a private company willing to take unaccompanied children. It was due to arrive in Sydney on 6 May but  that flight was also cancelled when the Australian government brought in a controversial ban on all arrivals from India. ""It was our last hope, we have exhausted all options,"" Dilin told the BBC. ""We literally fell apart. Sometimes you get a ray of hope, but then there's a set back like this,"" he said. Drisya and Dilin told their story to an Australian Senate committee which is investigating the government's efforts to help stranded Australians return home from India. Drisya told the hearing that there were seven other unaccompanied children on the privately chartered flight. The couple, who have connected with families in similar situations on social media, say many of the children are very young - some even younger than Johannah. Allow Twitter content?

""I plead, on behalf of all of them, to please consider the option of bringing in minors unaccompanied, either through repatriation flights or even private chartered flights,"" Dilin said. Senior Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) official Lynette Wood said a flight specifically for children had not been considered, and that the government was working directly with families to try and bring children home. The BBC also approached the DFAT for comment on this article. Australia's High Commissioner to India Barry O'Farrell told the hearing 20 unaccompanied minors had been helped home since December.

They went back to Malaysia and started making preparations to move to Sydney a few months later. Johannah was due to arrive in Sydney on 6 May, but the flight was cancelled due to the Australian government's India flight ban Their reunion was thrown into disarray when the pandemic hit and Johannah's flight home was cancelled. As time went on, all of the flights they managed to book were cancelled, or Johannah was ""bumped"" - which means she was no longer able to fly, because the number of people allowed to enter Australia that day had been reached.

""When we can see her again she will have grown up a lot, it's that time we have lost, that we can never get back,"" Dilin told the Senate committee.

"Nicola Sturgeon easily saw off a challenge from Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar in her Glasgow Southside constituency The SNP has won three key seats but its hopes of securing an overall majority in the Scottish Parliament election remain on a knife edge. The party has taken both Edinburgh Central - where former MP Angus Robertson was standing for the SNP - and Ayr from the Conservatives. It also won the East Lothian seat from Labour. But it fell short in other targets, with counting in the remaining seats due to resume on Saturday. No other constituencies have changed hands so far, with the SNP currently on 39 seats, the Liberal Democrats four, Tories two and Labour one. But the opposition parties will see their number of seats increase dramatically once the regional list results are finalised on Saturday. The story of the Scottish election so far Scottish election results in maps and charts Full details of the results from across Scotland,external Polling expert Prof Sir John Curtice said it was now unlikely, but not impossible, that the SNP would achieve an overall majority in the new Holyrood parliament. And he said there were clear signs that tactical voting by pro-UK voters in some parts of the country had been successful. The Alba Party, which was founded by former first minister and SNP leader Alex Salmond, looks unlikely to win any seats.

As the count resumed on Saturday, Aberdeenshire East was first to declare with the SNP's Gillian Martin holding her seat with a reduced majority of 1,889 over the Scottish Conservatives - who increased their vote share by 11%. Friday's results included First Minister Nicola Sturgeon - the SNP leader - easily holding off a challenge from Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar in her Glasgow Southside constituency. Ms Sturgeon won by 9,456 votes, only marginally lower than the 9,593 she won by in 2016. Turnout has been higher than anticipated in many areas, with the SNP's share of the vote falling in many of the early constituencies to declare but increasing in others. The A-Z of Scotland's constituencies,external When will we know the result of the Scottish election? BBC Scotland election results coverage When will my seat declare? Ms Sturgeon said that the SNP ""appears to be on course for a fourth consecutive election victory and to be on course to have the privilege of forming a government again"". She pledged to ""get back to work immediately"" and lead the country's Covid recovery. ""And then, when the time is right, to offer this country the choice of a better future,"" she added. It comes as UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson suggested he would reject any calls for a second independence referendum, saying it would be ""irresponsible and reckless"" right now. Asked if an SNP majority would mean there was a mandate for another vote, he toldthe Daily Telegraph,external: ""I think that count is still taking place and we'll have to see what happens. I listened to the Scottish election carefully. My impression was that they [the SNP] moved away from the idea of a referendum, and I think very wisely. ""I don't think this is anything like the time to have more constitutional wrangling, to be talking about ripping our country apart, when actually people want to heal our economy and bounce forward together. That's what people want."" John Swinney told BBC Breakfast he was 'confident' there would be a pro-independence majority However deputy first minister John Swinney toldBBC Breakfastthat his party would legislate for a second referendum if Mr Johnson were to block one. He said: ""We've said we will take forward legislation to have a legal referendum - we already have put in place some of the legislative arrangements for that process. We will embark on such an agenda should there be a majority for such a proposition in the Scottish Parliament."" Mr Swinney said that although he was waiting to see the ""electoral arithmetic"" of the final results, he was ""very confident"" there would be a majority of candidates ""elected on a programme to deliver a referendum on independence"". This election has a long way to go with a further 26 constituencies and all 56 regional list seats still to declare. While the SNP is on course to finish as the largest party, there are only limited opportunities left for them to do so with an overall majority. To achieve that they really need to hold all they have and pick up an additional constituency seat like Aberdeenshire West, where the Conservatives are defending a majority of 900 votes. There is also a possible pathway if they do better than expected on the regional lists which are very hard to predict because of the proportional voting system. If the SNP fall short of that outright majority they could enter a fourth term in office as a minority government (as they are now) or seek a more formal arrangement with another party - most likely the Greens. Together the SNP and the Greens will almost certainly have a pro-independence majority at Holyrood - committed to holding another referendum that the UK government seems determined to resist. A big wrangle over indyref2 is coming and it could end up in the UK Supreme Court. The constituencies that declared on Friday included eight of the SNP's top 10 target seats. The Conservatives held Dumfriesshire, which had been one of the SNP's goals, with Oliver Mundell increasing his majority, while Jackson Carlaw held the marginal Eastwood seat for the Tories from the SNP. And Labour's Daniel Johnson held off the SNP challenge in Edinburgh Southern and the party's deputy leader Jackie Baillie increased her majority over the SNP in Dumbarton. Labour increase majority in Dumbarton Jackson suspended over Yousaf confrontation Salmond says Alba may not win any seats Robertson takes Davidson's former seat The election is seen as being crucial to the future of the UK as the result could impact on whether or not there is a second referendum on Scottish independence. The SNP - which has formed the devolved Scottish government since 2007 -  will once again finish as the largest party, but is seeking to win an overall majority to strengthen the case for indyref2. Although it is not yet clear that it will win a majority by itself, there is likely to be a pro-independence majority in the parliament once the Scottish Greens are allocated regional list seats on Saturday.

"The SNP will form the next Holyrood government having won 64 seats - just one short of an overall majority Party leader and first minister Nicola Sturgeon says she wants to see the country through the pandemic and then ""give people in Scotland the right to choose their future"" With all results declared, the Scottish Conservatives have secured 31 seats (no change); Scottish Labour 22 (-2); Scottish Greens 8 (+2) and Scottish Lib Dems 4 (-1) Smaller parties, including former Scottish first minister Alex Salmond's Alba and George Galloway's All for Unity, won nothing The turnout of 66% is the highest since the parliament was established in 1999 BBC Scotland News The final results are in after a second day of counting in the Scottish Parliament election. Here are the key points: Glenn CampbellBBC Scotland Political Editor Having secured a fourth term in power for the SNP, Nicola
Sturgeon is not short of things to do as first minister. She has to form a government - that could be another
SNP-only administration, unless she wants to explore a more formal arrangement
with the independence-supporting Greens to secure an outright majority. She has to reshuffle her ministers, with four cabinet
posts - including that of health secretary - needing filled as a result of
retirements. There are also important decisions that need to be taken
on coronavirus - with a further easing of restrictions due on 17 May, plans
to reopen international travel to consider and concern over Covid cases in
Moray to address. Ms Sturgeon has insisted that dealing with the pandemic
and its aftermath will be her immediate priority - although clearly she intends
to press the case for another independence referendum too. There are also formalities - being sworn in with the
other 128 MSPs on Thursday, before putting herself forward in parliament for
re-election as first minister the following week. SNP deputy leader Keith Brown:""It is a fantastic win for the SNP. We have won this election out the park and in the process secured a historic fourth term.  We have got perhaps the most exciting manifesto I have ever seen in the SNP, and we are looking forward to implementing those policies."" Scottish Conservative MSP Craig Hoy:""This is a very good result for the Scottish Conservatives. We asked the pro-UK majority to come behind us and stop the SNP getting a majority, and we have done that. They thought they would walk into it and we have deprived them of that."" Labour MP Ian Murray:""We came into this campaign looking to stop the rot. Anas Sarwar has led from the front and he has won this election in terms of the party leaders and has put Scottish Labour back on the park. We are optimistic and looking forward to the future now."" Scottish Greens co-leader Lorna Slater:âWith this record result, the Scottish Greens have grown
our votes and influence in Scotland at this election. Thatâs because while
other parties focused on short-term tactical voting, the Scottish Greens
conducted a positive campaign on a green recovery and tackling the climate
crisis."" Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie:""We have had some astonishing constituency results, with almost half the vote in Shetland, more in Orkney and North East Fife and the highest vote for any constituency since the formation of the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh Western. It is frustrating that we werenât able to move the dial in other constituencies and on the regional lists."" Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent The SNPâs victory in these elections means the party is
heading for at least 19 years in power. Thatâs remarkable. Some will be slightly disappointed at not achieving a
majority. But the fact there is a comfortable pro-independence majority means
the issue is going to continue to be a significant one in Scottish and UK politics for years. In Downing Street, the plan was always to say no to
indyref2. That hasnât changed today, meaning a big political and potentially
legal battle is coming. But maybe not immediately. Nicola Sturgeon has said her
immediate focus will be the pandemic. Thatâs one way in which the Scottish and
UK governments agree. Kirsten CampbellBBC Scotland political correspondent The sixth session of the Scottish Parliament is going to be
the most diverse yet. There will be more women than have ever been elected before, more
disabled MSPs and more politicians from minority ethnic backgrounds. A total of 58 female candidates have been successful. The previous high was 48, back in 1999. The SNP actively chose to replace MSPs who were standing down with
female candidates where possible. Labour too sought to promote women by zipping candidates,
alternating men and women on their party list. Leader Anas Sarwar, who by
rights should have topped the Glasgow list, ceded the top spot to Pauline
McNeill to set an example. The challenge for Holyrood will be to
retain this new cohort. Politics is a notoriously un-family-friendly business.
Four female MSPs with young children decided to stand down this year to
find a better work-life balance. With all the results in, the SNP has won a fourth consecutive victory in the Scottish Parliament election. The party finished on 64 seats - one more than in 2016, but one short of an overall majority. The Conservatives won 31 seats, Labour 22, the Scottish Greens eight and Liberal Democrats four. You can check outall the results here. Professor Sir John CurticePolling expert The final share of the vote for the pro-independence parties combined on the two ballots is as follows:  This leaves plenty of room for argument as to whether or not this election did register majority support for the idea of holding another referendum on independence. Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor For a minority SNP administration, Greens are vital to Holyrood voting
through an independence referendum. There is much that the two sides can
agree on, including action on climate change. The
Greens could hope to force a faster pace of reduction
in emissions, pushing for more spend on public transport, less on roads, and
improved energy efficiency in homes and public buildings. The tensions are more likely to be around
oil and gas. The SNP is signed up to a transition
from burning fossil fuels to renewable energy, but it is more cautious than the Greens about the speed of winding down the oil and gas sector. That has become politically
sensitive in the Holyrood election. Tactical voting has
underlined the battle between the SNP and Tories in north east Scotland, once the SNPâs heartland. Since last yearâs plummet in the oil price, the SNP cannot
be seen to be too negative about the offshore industry without having a strong
and credible message about the transition and securing jobs. The Greens could hope to make progress, as
they claim to have done in 2018, in shifting tax policy. Their
manifesto was in favour of a shift to taxing wealth. That would include reform of council tax and business
rates, to base tax on land and asset values. The SNP has wanted to replace
council tax as well, but has given up on proposing a clear alternative in the
hope of cross-party agreement. It would be wary of major reforms, for the risk of
political backlash from those who lose out. Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor Nicola Sturgeon will be looking for allies to support her minority government The election of another SNP minority government opens up
questions of where it would build a coalition or shifting alliances needed to secure
votes, legislation and budgets. Having
done so as a minority administration between 2007 and 2011, and again since 2016,
it has a lot of experience in making that happen. And
having built up a rapport in the most recent parliament with Scottish Greens,
on budgets as well as independence, that is the obvious place to look for the
big votes. Greens
point out the sessions when the SNP relied more on
Conservative MSPs to get its business through. A
coalition would likely involve a formal deal on legislation. Deals between Labour and Lib Dems in 1999 and 2003 were brokered by
civil servants and depended heavily on finding common ground in manifestos. The Lib Dems
secured a disproportionately large number
of ministerial jobs, and held a veto over Labour on unforeseen votes. With their experience of minority government, it seems unlikely the SNP would go for that arrangement unless forced. The Scottish Greens would also be wary, if they look at the Lib Dems' track record at Holyrood and Westminster. Junior partners in coalitions can be burned by the compromises required. The SNP could look for a ""confidence and supply"" arrangement, to secure budgets and when other opposition parties put down motions of no confidence. But Greens have also been learning lessons about how to make the most of their leverage, and any such deal could be hard won by the SNP. Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar says his party are ""on a journey"" and ""back on the pitch"" despite being projected to finish with two fewer seats (22) than they achieved in the 2016 election. Mr Sarwar, who has only been in the role for 10 weeks, told BBC Scotland that time was not on his side - but that ""even his harshest critics"" would say the party has ""come a long way in that time"". ""I am happy compared to where we were 10 weeks ago, but am I satisfied in terms of where I want us to get to? Of course not,"" he said. ""We are on a journey and I recognise that.â Mr Sarwar, who returns to Holyrood on the Glasgow regional list, maintains Scottish Labour ""have a credibility again"" after a ""positive and energetic campaign"". ""We are back on the pitch and people arenât embarrassed anymore to say they vote Labour,"" he added. He also pledged to work with other parties to prioritise the country's recovery from the Covid crisis. Mr Sarwar also hailed the election of the first women of colour to Holyrood and the success of Labour's Pam Duncan-Glancy,  who will be the parliament's first permanent wheelchair user. The SNP won six of the nine constituency seats in the
Lothian region, meaning they did not pick up any additional members on the
regional list despite getting the most votes. The Conservatives got three seats on the list:  Labour won two:  Scottish Greens won two:  Full results here People have two votes in Scottish Parliament elections - one for a constituency MSP, and another for a regional ballot. There are 73 constituency MSPs, each elected on a first-past-the-post system similar to the UK general election - the winner is the candidate who receives the most votes in each constituency. In the regional ballot, people vote for a party. The parties are then allocated a number of MSPs depending on how many votes they receive - once the number of constituencies already won in that region is taken into account - to make the overall result more proportional. There are eight electoral regions, each with seven regional MSPs. These are:  This means that people in Scotland are each represented by eight MSPs - one representing their constituency and the other seven representing their region. The Scottish government is formed from the party that hold the most seats in the parliament, or alternatively a coalition of more than one party. It is led by the first minister, who appoints a number of ministers to be in charge of departments such as education, health and finance. Professor Sir John CurticePolling expert The South of Scotland result has now been officially declared. The SNP have managed to grab the last of the list seats in this region, so the party has managed to win 64 seats rather than 63. The SNP gained two extra constituency seats in the South Scotland
region â East Lothian and Ayr. Their success in the constituency â taking six of the nine
seats in the region â means they drop down from three regional list seats to just
one. The Conservatives, who lost the constituency seat of Ayr, picked up an extra regional list seat after a strong showing on the additional
member list. The seats in South of Scotland were: Conservative won three (up one):  Labour won three (up one):  SNP won one (down two) Professor Sir John CurticePolling expert In the aftermath of the Scottish Parliament election, there will doubtless be attempts by both sides of the constitutional debate to claim that their side of the argument is the more popular. However, it looks as though this is not a debate that either side can win. Given the results that are in so far, it looks as though the SNP plus the Greens are heading for 49% of the constituency vote, and that the SNP plus the Greens and Alba may win 51% of the list vote. In truth, the only safe conclusion one can draw from these results is that Scotland is indeed divided down the middle on the constitutional question. Alex Salmond has failed in his bid to return to the Scottish Parliament, as his Alba party missed out on a seat in the North East regional list Alba polled 8,269 votes in the region, 2.3% of the vote - well short of the number required to get an MSP. The former first minister and SNP leader had earlier conceded that his new party was unlikely to return any parliamentarians to Holyrood Mr Salmond says he will continue as party leader. In a statement he said the 32 Alba candidates had been ""injecting urgency"" into the need to deliver independence and that it intended to stay on the political scene. It plans to hold a conference in June and contest local elections in Scotland next year. The SNP won eight of the nine constituency seats in the Mid Scotland and Fife region, so did not get any MSPs under the additional member system. The Conservatives won four:  Labour won two:  Scottish Greens won one:  Full results here Professor Sir John CurticePolling expert With just one of the South Scotland constituencies to declare its list result, it looks as though it may be nip and tuck between Labour and the SNP for the last of the seven list seats. Labour might have a slightly better chance, but the SNP could yet edge it. If they were to do so then the party would end up on 64 seats rather than 63. In the North East, the list results were in line with predictions - four Conservatives, two Labour and one Green. BBC Radio Scotland Alistair Carmichael,
the Liberal Democratsâ MP for Orkney and Shetland since 2001, said the predicted outcome for Willie Rennie's Scottish party - which would see them drop from five seats to four in Holyrood - was a âdisappointing result, there
is no getting away from thatâ. Despite that, Mr Carmichael said there was nothing about the party's campaign ""for which we should be apologising or should be embarrassed"". He congratulated the SNP, and Nicola Sturgeon in particular, for âa quite
remarkable election outcomeâ. Ms Sturgeon was ""right"", he said, in saying she would prioritise
dealing with the pandemic first, but believed there were ""mixed messagesâ in
hercomments on an independence referendum, which âsuggested her mind might well be
elsewhereâ. As long as the first minister ""is prepared to
put the recovery first, then she will get a fair hearing from us,"" Mr Carmichael told BBC Radio Scotland. Pam Gosal Pam Gosal has become the second woman of colour to be elected to the Scottish Parliament. The Conservative candidate was elected as an MSP via the Glasgow list. Earlier this year, Ms Gosal said she had experienced racist abuse throughout her life but said it would never stop her.Read more here. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Grant Shapps on the green list destinations: ""This is just a first step"" Twelve destinations have been put on a green travel list for people in England, meaning anyone returning will not need to quarantine from 17 May. A new traffic light system of rules means international travel will no longer be illegal. However, places on the green list - which includes Portugal, Israel and Gibraltar - have their own restrictions on who can visit from abroad. The transport secretary said the UK approach was ""necessarily cautious"". But the travel industry has said it is too cautious and called it a reopening of air travel ""in name only"". Turkey, the Maldives and Nepal will be added to England's red list of countries from 04:00 BST on Wednesday 12 May, meaning travellers from those destinations will have to quarantine in a hotel for 10 days on their return. The biggest group is the amber list - which includes popular European destinations such as Spain, Italy and France. People returning from those countries have to isolate from home for at least five days - but Mr Shapps said no-one should be travelling to those destinations at the moment. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have not said when they might ease their strict travel restrictions, but Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said all four of the UK's chief medical officers agreed on the principles behind the traffic light system. Which countries are on the green list? What are my refund rights for foreign holidays? Travel firms reject 'overly cautious' green list Speaking at a Downing Street briefing, Mr Shapps said the changes were a ""tentative"" first step to opening up travel, as there remained ""concern about the resurgence of Covid"". Mr Shapps said the ""success in combating Covid"" in the UK was ""not yet replicated in many places abroad"". ""We must make sure the countries we reconnect with are safe,"" he added. Covid tests will be required before and after travel. The long-awaited restart of international travel is less throwing open the doors, more opening them a crack. That's a deliberate decision by the government, which is hoping to reassure those who are nervous about opening the country's borders while also giving a small concession to the travel industry. Some in the industry are not impressed, calling the list a ""missed opportunity"". Many of the transport secretary's comments - he dissuaded passengers from travelling to amber countries and warned them to expect queues at the border - will be seen as trying to dampen down demand, just at the moment when the industry was hoping to start to ramp up. Ultimately, the real test will be in a few weeks' time when the government will announce the green list for June. The industry will be hoping it's a little longer than this list. Mr Shapps said people looking to travel overseas should check any restrictions that apply to new arrivals, and not book trips which do not include a refund should the Covid situation change. Countries on the green, amber and red lists would be reviewed every three weeks from 17 May, he added. Spain's ministry of tourism said the decision had no immediate effect with restrictions still in place for non-essential travel from the UK. But a spokesperson said Madrid ""reiterates its conviction that this summer it will be possible for British citizens to spend their holidays in Spain"" and it predicts that in June ""we will be able to start the reactivation of international travel"". This video can not be played ""No-one enjoys a holiday more"": A restaurant owner in Portugal is excited to welcome back tourists from England The travel industry has been largely critical, with Airlines UK calling the move a missed opportunity and ""a reopening of air travel in name only"" which leaves the UK ""at risk of falling behind"". Andrew Flintham, managing director of holiday firm Tui, said it was ""an overly cautious start"". Easyjet chief executive Johan Lundgren said: ""The decision to put so few European countries into the green tier is simply not justified by the data or the science and is inconsistent with the approach to reopen the domestic economy."" Travellers have also been warned of queues at the UK border when they return. Border Force director Paul Lincoln said the increased delays would be at each stage of their journeys, with staff required to check ""100%"" of all travellers coming through. Red list countries have the strictest rules, with only UK or Irish nationals and UK residents allowed to return. They must pay for a 10-day stay in a government-approved quarantine hotel. Asked what Turkey being added to the red list means for the Champions League final between Manchester City and Chelsea in Istanbul, Mr Shapps said fans should not travel to Turkey. He added that the Football Association is in discussions with European football's governing body UEFA about the UK hosting the final.

Qantas, which operates flights between India and Australia, also does not allow unaccompanied minors, so the couple's only other option is to charter a private plane or fly with Air India. However, until recently Johannah was still too young. Drisya and Dilin did not risk trying to fly back to India to be with Johannah because of the limited flights to return to Australia from there. The coupled feared they would join the 9,000 people in India struggling to get home to Australia. Australia to resume some India flights after backlash Why can't Australians get back into their country? Drisya and Dilin were finally able to get Johannah a seat on a chartered plane from Bangalore to Sydney, with a private company willing to take unaccompanied children. It was due to arrive in Sydney on 6 May but  that flight was also cancelled when the Australian government brought in a controversial ban on all arrivals from India. ""It was our last hope, we have exhausted all options,"" Dilin told the BBC. ""We literally fell apart. Sometimes you get a ray of hope, but then there's a set back like this,"" he said. Drisya and Dilin told their story to an Australian Senate committee which is investigating the government's efforts to help stranded Australians return home from India. Drisya told the hearing that there were seven other unaccompanied children on the privately chartered flight. The couple, who have connected with families in similar situations on social media, say many of the children are very young - some even younger than Johannah. Allow Twitter content?

""I plead, on behalf of all of them, to please consider the option of bringing in minors unaccompanied, either through repatriation flights or even private chartered flights,"" Dilin said. Senior Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) official Lynette Wood said a flight specifically for children had not been considered, and that the government was working directly with families to try and bring children home. The BBC also approached the DFAT for comment on this article. Australia's High Commissioner to India Barry O'Farrell told the hearing 20 unaccompanied minors had been helped home since December. The trio were living in Malaysia and visiting family in India when Drisya and Dilin left Johannah to spend a longer holiday with her grandparents in the southern state of Kerala. They went back to Malaysia and started making preparations to move to Sydney a few months later. Johannah was due to arrive in Sydney on 6 May, but the flight was cancelled due to the Australian government's India flight ban Their reunion was thrown into disarray when the pandemic hit and Johannah's flight home was cancelled. As time went on, all of the flights they managed to book were cancelled, or Johannah was ""bumped"" - which means she was no longer able to fly, because the number of people allowed to enter Australia that day had been reached. The Australians who are trapped in the UK Celebrity rush exposes Australian 'double standard' Johannah's Malaysian visa eventually expired, and her parents had to move to Sydney without her. ""When we can see her again she will have grown up a lot, it's that time we have lost, that we can never get back,"" Dilin told the Senate committee. ""What we have missed as parents is her prime childhood ageâ¦ It's been almost one and a half years that we have not seen her grow,"" he added, holding back tears. Drisya often finds it hard to sleep and says she cries through the night, missing her young daughter. ""I can only imagine the emotional pain she is going through now, even though we are trying to keep her happy, buying her books, but I think from the bottom of her heart, there's nothing her parents can be replaced with,"" Dilin said.

"This video can not be played Grant Shapps on the green list destinations: ""This is just a first step"" Twelve destinations have been put on a green travel list for people in England, meaning anyone returning will not need to quarantine from 17 May. A new traffic light system of rules means international travel will no longer be illegal. However, places on the green list - which includes Portugal, Israel and Gibraltar - have their own restrictions on who can visit from abroad. The transport secretary said the UK approach was ""necessarily cautious"". But the travel industry has said it is too cautious and called it a reopening of air travel ""in name only"". Turkey, the Maldives and Nepal will be added to England's red list of countries from 04:00 BST on Wednesday 12 May, meaning travellers from those destinations will have to quarantine in a hotel for 10 days on their return. The biggest group is the amber list - which includes popular European destinations such as Spain, Italy and France. People returning from those countries have to isolate from home for at least five days - but Mr Shapps said no-one should be travelling to those destinations at the moment. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have not said when they might ease their strict travel restrictions, but Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said all four of the UK's chief medical officers agreed on the principles behind the traffic light system. Which countries are on the green list? What are my refund rights for foreign holidays? Travel firms reject 'overly cautious' green list Speaking at a Downing Street briefing, Mr Shapps said the changes were a ""tentative"" first step to opening up travel, as there remained ""concern about the resurgence of Covid"". Mr Shapps said the ""success in combating Covid"" in the UK was ""not yet replicated in many places abroad"". ""We must make sure the countries we reconnect with are safe,"" he added. Covid tests will be required before and after travel. The long-awaited restart of international travel is less throwing open the doors, more opening them a crack. That's a deliberate decision by the government, which is hoping to reassure those who are nervous about opening the country's borders while also giving a small concession to the travel industry. Some in the industry are not impressed, calling the list a ""missed opportunity"". Many of the transport secretary's comments - he dissuaded passengers from travelling to amber countries and warned them to expect queues at the border - will be seen as trying to dampen down demand, just at the moment when the industry was hoping to start to ramp up. Ultimately, the real test will be in a few weeks' time when the government will announce the green list for June. The industry will be hoping it's a little longer than this list. Mr Shapps said people looking to travel overseas should check any restrictions that apply to new arrivals, and not book trips which do not include a refund should the Covid situation change. Countries on the green, amber and red lists would be reviewed every three weeks from 17 May, he added. Spain's ministry of tourism said the decision had no immediate effect with restrictions still in place for non-essential travel from the UK. But a spokesperson said Madrid ""reiterates its conviction that this summer it will be possible for British citizens to spend their holidays in Spain"" and it predicts that in June ""we will be able to start the reactivation of international travel"". This video can not be played ""No-one enjoys a holiday more"": A restaurant owner in Portugal is excited to welcome back tourists from England The travel industry has been largely critical, with Airlines UK calling the move a missed opportunity and ""a reopening of air travel in name only"" which leaves the UK ""at risk of falling behind"". Andrew Flintham, managing director of holiday firm Tui, said it was ""an overly cautious start"". Easyjet chief executive Johan Lundgren said: ""The decision to put so few European countries into the green tier is simply not justified by the data or the science and is inconsistent with the approach to reopen the domestic economy."" Travellers have also been warned of queues at the UK border when they return. Border Force director Paul Lincoln said the increased delays would be at each stage of their journeys, with staff required to check ""100%"" of all travellers coming through. Red list countries have the strictest rules, with only UK or Irish nationals and UK residents allowed to return. They must pay for a 10-day stay in a government-approved quarantine hotel. Asked what Turkey being added to the red list means for the Champions League final between Manchester City and Chelsea in Istanbul, Mr Shapps said fans should not travel to Turkey. He added that the Football Association is in discussions with European football's governing body UEFA about the UK hosting the final.

"Holidaymakers in England are to find out which ""green list"" countries they can visit without quarantining on their return later this afternoon. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps will unveil details of new travel rules at a coronavirus briefing at 17:00 BST. Rules will be based on a traffic light system, with countries rated green, amber or red based on their Covid risk. Currently, people in England face fines for holidaying abroad, and must have a valid reason for foreign travel. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have not said when they might ease their strict travel rules. How will the traffic light system work? Where can I go on holiday in the UK now? What are the current travel rules? The list of green countries with the fewest travel restrictions is expected to be small when the rules come into effect on 17 May. Travellers to countries rated green will not need to isolate on their return, but they will need to take a Covid test before and after their trip. Arrivals from amber countries will need to quarantine, while red-list countries have the strictest rules, with only UK or Irish nationals, or UK residents, allowed to return - and they must pay for a 10-day stay in a government quarantine hotel. Countries will be categorised based on their number of Covid cases and the success of vaccine rollouts. At the moment, the UK has fewer cases and a higher rate of vaccinations than many popular destinations, including France, Spain, Greece and Turkey. Infections in Portugal are at a similar level to that in the UK, with 27 confirmed virus cases per 100,000 people per week compared with 21 in the UK, according to figures from Our World in Data from 4 May. The UK government previously said the travel rules will be reviewed again on 28 June to see whether any measures can be relaxed further. The chief executive of Booking.com warned thattravel prices would risedue to pent-up demand and fewer planes in service. While the UK's largest tour operator, Tui,has said it will subsidise the cost of Covid testingfor its customers, offering test packages for between Â£20 and Â£90. Ahead of the transport secretary's announcement, airline giant IAG, which owns British Airways,said it was ""ready to fly""but urged the government to introduce affordable, simple and proportionate testing to replace quarantine. Meanwhile, a coronavirus variant first detected in India has been escalated to a ""variant of concern"" by Public Health England, as scientists believe it is at least as transmissible as the Kent variant. India is currently on the red list of countries, with people only able to enter the United Kingdom from there if they are a British or Irish national, or UK resident.

"Nicola Sturgeon easily saw off a challenge from Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar in her Glasgow Southside constituency The SNP has won three key seats but its hopes of securing an overall majority in the Scottish Parliament election remain on a knife edge. The party has taken both Edinburgh Central - where former MP Angus Robertson was standing for the SNP - and Ayr from the Conservatives. It also won the East Lothian seat from Labour. But it fell short in other targets, with counting in the remaining seats due to resume on Saturday. No other constituencies have changed hands so far, with the SNP currently on 39 seats, the Liberal Democrats four, Tories two and Labour one. But the opposition parties will see their number of seats increase dramatically once the regional list results are finalised on Saturday. The story of the Scottish election so far Scottish election results in maps and charts Full details of the results from across Scotland,external Polling expert Prof Sir John Curtice said it was now unlikely, but not impossible, that the SNP would achieve an overall majority in the new Holyrood parliament. And he said there were clear signs that tactical voting by pro-UK voters in some parts of the country had been successful. The Alba Party, which was founded by former first minister and SNP leader Alex Salmond, looks unlikely to win any seats.

As the count resumed on Saturday, Aberdeenshire East was first to declare with the SNP's Gillian Martin holding her seat with a reduced majority of 1,889 over the Scottish Conservatives - who increased their vote share by 11%. Friday's results included First Minister Nicola Sturgeon - the SNP leader - easily holding off a challenge from Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar in her Glasgow Southside constituency. Ms Sturgeon won by 9,456 votes, only marginally lower than the 9,593 she won by in 2016. Turnout has been higher than anticipated in many areas, with the SNP's share of the vote falling in many of the early constituencies to declare but increasing in others. The A-Z of Scotland's constituencies,external When will we know the result of the Scottish election? BBC Scotland election results coverage When will my seat declare? Ms Sturgeon said that the SNP ""appears to be on course for a fourth consecutive election victory and to be on course to have the privilege of forming a government again"". She pledged to ""get back to work immediately"" and lead the country's Covid recovery. ""And then, when the time is right, to offer this country the choice of a better future,"" she added. It comes as UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson suggested he would reject any calls for a second independence referendum, saying it would be ""irresponsible and reckless"" right now. Asked if an SNP majority would mean there was a mandate for another vote, he toldthe Daily Telegraph,external: ""I think that count is still taking place and we'll have to see what happens. I listened to the Scottish election carefully. My impression was that they [the SNP] moved away from the idea of a referendum, and I think very wisely. ""I don't think this is anything like the time to have more constitutional wrangling, to be talking about ripping our country apart, when actually people want to heal our economy and bounce forward together. That's what people want."" John Swinney told BBC Breakfast he was 'confident' there would be a pro-independence majority However deputy first minister John Swinney toldBBC Breakfastthat his party would legislate for a second referendum if Mr Johnson were to block one. He said: ""We've said we will take forward legislation to have a legal referendum - we already have put in place some of the legislative arrangements for that process. We will embark on such an agenda should there be a majority for such a proposition in the Scottish Parliament."" Mr Swinney said that although he was waiting to see the ""electoral arithmetic"" of the final results, he was ""very confident"" there would be a majority of candidates ""elected on a programme to deliver a referendum on independence"". This election has a long way to go with a further 26 constituencies and all 56 regional list seats still to declare. While the SNP is on course to finish as the largest party, there are only limited opportunities left for them to do so with an overall majority. To achieve that they really need to hold all they have and pick up an additional constituency seat like Aberdeenshire West, where the Conservatives are defending a majority of 900 votes. There is also a possible pathway if they do better than expected on the regional lists which are very hard to predict because of the proportional voting system. If the SNP fall short of that outright majority they could enter a fourth term in office as a minority government (as they are now) or seek a more formal arrangement with another party - most likely the Greens. Together the SNP and the Greens will almost certainly have a pro-independence majority at Holyrood - committed to holding another referendum that the UK government seems determined to resist. A big wrangle over indyref2 is coming and it could end up in the UK Supreme Court. The constituencies that declared on Friday included eight of the SNP's top 10 target seats. The Conservatives held Dumfriesshire, which had been one of the SNP's goals, with Oliver Mundell increasing his majority, while Jackson Carlaw held the marginal Eastwood seat for the Tories from the SNP. And Labour's Daniel Johnson held off the SNP challenge in Edinburgh Southern and the party's deputy leader Jackie Baillie increased her majority over the SNP in Dumbarton. Labour increase majority in Dumbarton Jackson suspended over Yousaf confrontation Salmond says Alba may not win any seats Robertson takes Davidson's former seat The election is seen as being crucial to the future of the UK as the result could impact on whether or not there is a second referendum on Scottish independence. The SNP - which has formed the devolved Scottish government since 2007 -  will once again finish as the largest party, but is seeking to win an overall majority to strengthen the case for indyref2. Although it is not yet clear that it will win a majority by itself, there is likely to be a pro-independence majority in the parliament once the Scottish Greens are allocated regional list seats on Saturday.

"The vaccination of younger adults in Moray is to be accelerated because of the coronavirus surge in the area. NHS Grampian has announced appointments will start being given from Saturday to those between 18 and 39 who have not already been vaccinated. Health officials are urging everyone in Moray to take up asymptomatic testing in a bid to combat the recent spread. They are also considering the introduction of door-to-door testing in Elgin. Moray is experiencing what is being described as ""uncontrolled, sustained community transmission"" of Covid-19. Covid spread in Moray is 'uncontrolled' The region currently has an infection rate of more than 81 cases per 100,000 - four times the Scotland-wide level. Katrina Morrison, the clinical lead nurse for the vaccination programme, said additional stocks and the sustained community transmission in Moray had made the decision ""straightforward"". She said: ""It needs to happen quickly and our staff have been mobilised to speed up the process. ""During the first few days, we will phone to offer appointments before moving to letter appointments from the middle of next week. You may not recognise the number or the number may be withheld.  Check your voicemails regularly. ""Working together to reduce the spread in Moray will reduce the risk of further spread to Aberdeenshire and Aberdeen."" Allow Twitter content?

"The SNP will form the next Holyrood government having won 64 seats - just one short of an overall majority Party leader and first minister Nicola Sturgeon says she wants to see the country through the pandemic and then ""give people in Scotland the right to choose their future"" With all results declared, the Scottish Conservatives have secured 31 seats (no change); Scottish Labour 22 (-2); Scottish Greens 8 (+2) and Scottish Lib Dems 4 (-1) Smaller parties, including former Scottish first minister Alex Salmond's Alba and George Galloway's All for Unity, won nothing The turnout of 66% is the highest since the parliament was established in 1999 BBC Scotland News The final results are in after a second day of counting in the Scottish Parliament election. Here are the key points: Glenn CampbellBBC Scotland Political Editor Having secured a fourth term in power for the SNP, Nicola
Sturgeon is not short of things to do as first minister. She has to form a government - that could be another
SNP-only administration, unless she wants to explore a more formal arrangement
with the independence-supporting Greens to secure an outright majority. She has to reshuffle her ministers, with four cabinet
posts - including that of health secretary - needing filled as a result of
retirements. There are also important decisions that need to be taken
on coronavirus - with a further easing of restrictions due on 17 May, plans
to reopen international travel to consider and concern over Covid cases in
Moray to address. Ms Sturgeon has insisted that dealing with the pandemic
and its aftermath will be her immediate priority - although clearly she intends
to press the case for another independence referendum too. There are also formalities - being sworn in with the
other 128 MSPs on Thursday, before putting herself forward in parliament for
re-election as first minister the following week. SNP deputy leader Keith Brown:""It is a fantastic win for the SNP. We have won this election out the park and in the process secured a historic fourth term.  We have got perhaps the most exciting manifesto I have ever seen in the SNP, and we are looking forward to implementing those policies."" Scottish Conservative MSP Craig Hoy:""This is a very good result for the Scottish Conservatives. We asked the pro-UK majority to come behind us and stop the SNP getting a majority, and we have done that. They thought they would walk into it and we have deprived them of that."" Labour MP Ian Murray:""We came into this campaign looking to stop the rot. Anas Sarwar has led from the front and he has won this election in terms of the party leaders and has put Scottish Labour back on the park. We are optimistic and looking forward to the future now."" Scottish Greens co-leader Lorna Slater:âWith this record result, the Scottish Greens have grown
our votes and influence in Scotland at this election. Thatâs because while
other parties focused on short-term tactical voting, the Scottish Greens
conducted a positive campaign on a green recovery and tackling the climate
crisis."" Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie:""We have had some astonishing constituency results, with almost half the vote in Shetland, more in Orkney and North East Fife and the highest vote for any constituency since the formation of the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh Western. It is frustrating that we werenât able to move the dial in other constituencies and on the regional lists."" Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent The SNPâs victory in these elections means the party is
heading for at least 19 years in power. Thatâs remarkable. Some will be slightly disappointed at not achieving a
majority. But the fact there is a comfortable pro-independence majority means
the issue is going to continue to be a significant one in Scottish and UK politics for years. In Downing Street, the plan was always to say no to
indyref2. That hasnât changed today, meaning a big political and potentially
legal battle is coming. But maybe not immediately. Nicola Sturgeon has said her
immediate focus will be the pandemic. Thatâs one way in which the Scottish and
UK governments agree. Kirsten CampbellBBC Scotland political correspondent The sixth session of the Scottish Parliament is going to be
the most diverse yet. There will be more women than have ever been elected before, more
disabled MSPs and more politicians from minority ethnic backgrounds. A total of 58 female candidates have been successful. The previous high was 48, back in 1999. The SNP actively chose to replace MSPs who were standing down with
female candidates where possible. Labour too sought to promote women by zipping candidates,
alternating men and women on their party list. Leader Anas Sarwar, who by
rights should have topped the Glasgow list, ceded the top spot to Pauline
McNeill to set an example. The challenge for Holyrood will be to
retain this new cohort. Politics is a notoriously un-family-friendly business.
Four female MSPs with young children decided to stand down this year to
find a better work-life balance. With all the results in, the SNP has won a fourth consecutive victory in the Scottish Parliament election. The party finished on 64 seats - one more than in 2016, but one short of an overall majority. The Conservatives won 31 seats, Labour 22, the Scottish Greens eight and Liberal Democrats four. You can check outall the results here. Professor Sir John CurticePolling expert The final share of the vote for the pro-independence parties combined on the two ballots is as follows:  This leaves plenty of room for argument as to whether or not this election did register majority support for the idea of holding another referendum on independence. Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor For a minority SNP administration, Greens are vital to Holyrood voting
through an independence referendum. There is much that the two sides can
agree on, including action on climate change. The
Greens could hope to force a faster pace of reduction
in emissions, pushing for more spend on public transport, less on roads, and
improved energy efficiency in homes and public buildings. The tensions are more likely to be around
oil and gas. The SNP is signed up to a transition
from burning fossil fuels to renewable energy, but it is more cautious than the Greens about the speed of winding down the oil and gas sector. That has become politically
sensitive in the Holyrood election. Tactical voting has
underlined the battle between the SNP and Tories in north east Scotland, once the SNPâs heartland. Since last yearâs plummet in the oil price, the SNP cannot
be seen to be too negative about the offshore industry without having a strong
and credible message about the transition and securing jobs. The Greens could hope to make progress, as
they claim to have done in 2018, in shifting tax policy. Their
manifesto was in favour of a shift to taxing wealth. That would include reform of council tax and business
rates, to base tax on land and asset values. The SNP has wanted to replace
council tax as well, but has given up on proposing a clear alternative in the
hope of cross-party agreement. It would be wary of major reforms, for the risk of
political backlash from those who lose out. Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor Nicola Sturgeon will be looking for allies to support her minority government The election of another SNP minority government opens up
questions of where it would build a coalition or shifting alliances needed to secure
votes, legislation and budgets. Having
done so as a minority administration between 2007 and 2011, and again since 2016,
it has a lot of experience in making that happen. And
having built up a rapport in the most recent parliament with Scottish Greens,
on budgets as well as independence, that is the obvious place to look for the
big votes. Greens
point out the sessions when the SNP relied more on
Conservative MSPs to get its business through. A
coalition would likely involve a formal deal on legislation. Deals between Labour and Lib Dems in 1999 and 2003 were brokered by
civil servants and depended heavily on finding common ground in manifestos. The Lib Dems
secured a disproportionately large number
of ministerial jobs, and held a veto over Labour on unforeseen votes. With their experience of minority government, it seems unlikely the SNP would go for that arrangement unless forced. The Scottish Greens would also be wary, if they look at the Lib Dems' track record at Holyrood and Westminster. Junior partners in coalitions can be burned by the compromises required. The SNP could look for a ""confidence and supply"" arrangement, to secure budgets and when other opposition parties put down motions of no confidence. But Greens have also been learning lessons about how to make the most of their leverage, and any such deal could be hard won by the SNP. Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar says his party are ""on a journey"" and ""back on the pitch"" despite being projected to finish with two fewer seats (22) than they achieved in the 2016 election. Mr Sarwar, who has only been in the role for 10 weeks, told BBC Scotland that time was not on his side - but that ""even his harshest critics"" would say the party has ""come a long way in that time"". ""I am happy compared to where we were 10 weeks ago, but am I satisfied in terms of where I want us to get to? Of course not,"" he said. ""We are on a journey and I recognise that.â Mr Sarwar, who returns to Holyrood on the Glasgow regional list, maintains Scottish Labour ""have a credibility again"" after a ""positive and energetic campaign"". ""We are back on the pitch and people arenât embarrassed anymore to say they vote Labour,"" he added. He also pledged to work with other parties to prioritise the country's recovery from the Covid crisis. Mr Sarwar also hailed the election of the first women of colour to Holyrood and the success of Labour's Pam Duncan-Glancy,  who will be the parliament's first permanent wheelchair user. The SNP won six of the nine constituency seats in the
Lothian region, meaning they did not pick up any additional members on the
regional list despite getting the most votes. The Conservatives got three seats on the list:  Labour won two:  Scottish Greens won two:  Full results here People have two votes in Scottish Parliament elections - one for a constituency MSP, and another for a regional ballot. There are 73 constituency MSPs, each elected on a first-past-the-post system similar to the UK general election - the winner is the candidate who receives the most votes in each constituency. In the regional ballot, people vote for a party. The parties are then allocated a number of MSPs depending on how many votes they receive - once the number of constituencies already won in that region is taken into account - to make the overall result more proportional. There are eight electoral regions, each with seven regional MSPs. These are:  This means that people in Scotland are each represented by eight MSPs - one representing their constituency and the other seven representing their region. The Scottish government is formed from the party that hold the most seats in the parliament, or alternatively a coalition of more than one party. It is led by the first minister, who appoints a number of ministers to be in charge of departments such as education, health and finance. Professor Sir John CurticePolling expert The South of Scotland result has now been officially declared. The SNP have managed to grab the last of the list seats in this region, so the party has managed to win 64 seats rather than 63. The SNP gained two extra constituency seats in the South Scotland
region â East Lothian and Ayr. Their success in the constituency â taking six of the nine
seats in the region â means they drop down from three regional list seats to just
one. The Conservatives, who lost the constituency seat of Ayr, picked up an extra regional list seat after a strong showing on the additional
member list. The seats in South of Scotland were: Conservative won three (up one):  Labour won three (up one):  SNP won one (down two) Professor Sir John CurticePolling expert In the aftermath of the Scottish Parliament election, there will doubtless be attempts by both sides of the constitutional debate to claim that their side of the argument is the more popular. However, it looks as though this is not a debate that either side can win. Given the results that are in so far, it looks as though the SNP plus the Greens are heading for 49% of the constituency vote, and that the SNP plus the Greens and Alba may win 51% of the list vote. In truth, the only safe conclusion one can draw from these results is that Scotland is indeed divided down the middle on the constitutional question. Alex Salmond has failed in his bid to return to the Scottish Parliament, as his Alba party missed out on a seat in the North East regional list Alba polled 8,269 votes in the region, 2.3% of the vote - well short of the number required to get an MSP. The former first minister and SNP leader had earlier conceded that his new party was unlikely to return any parliamentarians to Holyrood Mr Salmond says he will continue as party leader. In a statement he said the 32 Alba candidates had been ""injecting urgency"" into the need to deliver independence and that it intended to stay on the political scene. It plans to hold a conference in June and contest local elections in Scotland next year. The SNP won eight of the nine constituency seats in the Mid Scotland and Fife region, so did not get any MSPs under the additional member system. The Conservatives won four:  Labour won two:  Scottish Greens won one:  Full results here Professor Sir John CurticePolling expert With just one of the South Scotland constituencies to declare its list result, it looks as though it may be nip and tuck between Labour and the SNP for the last of the seven list seats. Labour might have a slightly better chance, but the SNP could yet edge it. If they were to do so then the party would end up on 64 seats rather than 63. In the North East, the list results were in line with predictions - four Conservatives, two Labour and one Green. BBC Radio Scotland Alistair Carmichael,
the Liberal Democratsâ MP for Orkney and Shetland since 2001, said the predicted outcome for Willie Rennie's Scottish party - which would see them drop from five seats to four in Holyrood - was a âdisappointing result, there
is no getting away from thatâ. Despite that, Mr Carmichael said there was nothing about the party's campaign ""for which we should be apologising or should be embarrassed"". He congratulated the SNP, and Nicola Sturgeon in particular, for âa quite
remarkable election outcomeâ. Ms Sturgeon was ""right"", he said, in saying she would prioritise
dealing with the pandemic first, but believed there were ""mixed messagesâ in
hercomments on an independence referendum, which âsuggested her mind might well be
elsewhereâ. As long as the first minister ""is prepared to
put the recovery first, then she will get a fair hearing from us,"" Mr Carmichael told BBC Radio Scotland. Pam Gosal Pam Gosal has become the second woman of colour to be elected to the Scottish Parliament. The Conservative candidate was elected as an MSP via the Glasgow list. Earlier this year, Ms Gosal said she had experienced racist abuse throughout her life but said it would never stop her.Read more here. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Holidaymakers in England are to find out which ""green list"" countries they can visit without quarantining on their return later this afternoon. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps will unveil details of new travel rules at a coronavirus briefing at 17:00 BST. Rules will be based on a traffic light system, with countries rated green, amber or red based on their Covid risk. Currently, people in England face fines for holidaying abroad, and must have a valid reason for foreign travel. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have not said when they might ease their strict travel rules. How will the traffic light system work? Where can I go on holiday in the UK now? What are the current travel rules? The list of green countries with the fewest travel restrictions is expected to be small when the rules come into effect on 17 May. Travellers to countries rated green will not need to isolate on their return, but they will need to take a Covid test before and after their trip. Arrivals from amber countries will need to quarantine, while red-list countries have the strictest rules, with only UK or Irish nationals, or UK residents, allowed to return - and they must pay for a 10-day stay in a government quarantine hotel. Countries will be categorised based on their number of Covid cases and the success of vaccine rollouts. At the moment, the UK has fewer cases and a higher rate of vaccinations than many popular destinations, including France, Spain, Greece and Turkey. Infections in Portugal are at a similar level to that in the UK, with 27 confirmed virus cases per 100,000 people per week compared with 21 in the UK, according to figures from Our World in Data from 4 May. The UK government previously said the travel rules will be reviewed again on 28 June to see whether any measures can be relaxed further. The chief executive of Booking.com warned thattravel prices would risedue to pent-up demand and fewer planes in service. While the UK's largest tour operator, Tui,has said it will subsidise the cost of Covid testingfor its customers, offering test packages for between Â£20 and Â£90. Ahead of the transport secretary's announcement, airline giant IAG, which owns British Airways,said it was ""ready to fly""but urged the government to introduce affordable, simple and proportionate testing to replace quarantine. Meanwhile, a coronavirus variant first detected in India has been escalated to a ""variant of concern"" by Public Health England, as scientists believe it is at least as transmissible as the Kent variant. India is currently on the red list of countries, with people only able to enter the United Kingdom from there if they are a British or Irish national, or UK resident.

"Stuart Lubbock died following a party at TV presenter Michael Barrymore's home near Harlow in March 2001 The ailing father of a man whose body was found in Michael Barrymore's swimming pool 20 years ago said he believed ""the truth will come out"". Stuart Lubbock, 31, died after being found unconscious in the TV presenter's pool in Roydon, Essex, in March 2001. This week, Essex Police said afile would be submitted ""imminently"" to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). Terry Lubbock, who has terminal cancer, said he could rest in peace knowing he had done the best for his son. Stuart, a butcher from Harlow, was at a party with eight other people at Mr Barrymore's home when he died. A post-mortem examination showed he suffered severe internal injuries which suggested he had been sexually assaulted. Michael Barrymore, 69, hosted a gathering at his house and Stuart Lubbock was found unconscious in his swimming pool A man in his 50s, who has not been named, was arrested in Cheshire in March on suspicion of murder and indecent assault after ""significant new information"" emerged, police said. ""I have done my best now for my son,"" said Mr Lubbock, a 76-year-old retired toolmaker. ""I can rest in peace now. I think the truth will come out."" He added: ""My body is going down, and my mind, and I am starting to forget things."" Terry Lubbock called for a fresh inquest but was refused an application to the High Court In February, Mr Lubbock saiddoctors had told him he had months to live. He said all he lived for was to get ""justice for Stuart"", but accepted he may never get the answers he wanted. In January, he called for a fresh inquest, and said he thought information must now have emerged which justified a fresh inquiry by a coroner. A coroner recorded an open verdict at an inquest in 2002 and, three years ago, the then-Attorney General, Jeremy Wright, refused to give Mr Lubbock permission to make an application to the High Court for a second inquest. But Mr Lubbock said a fresh Essex Police appeal, which coincided with the broadcast of aChannel 4 documentary Barrymore: The Body In The Poolin February 2020, had changed the landscape. No-one has been charged with any offence in relation to Stuart Lubbock's death. Mr Barrymore, now 69, was arrested in 2007 but never charged with any offence. He described the Channel 4 documentary as ""vile and vicious""and said nobody who was at his house on the night of Stuart Lubbock's death knew what happened. Asked if he had anything fresh to offer the police, he replied: ""I honestly wish I did."" Essex Police said it would soon pass a file to the CPS regarding the man who was arrested, following a ""substantial and detailed investigation"".

"Twitter has launched a new ""tip jar"" feature that lets people send money to others on the social network. The company says the feature is ""an easy way to support the incredible voices that make up the conversation"". To begin with, only a select group of people can receive tips - a group Twitter said was made up of ""creators"", journalists, experts, and non-profits. But the feature has also been criticised for exposing personal information such as email addresses. The tip jar function essentially adds a small icon to a user's profile - on mobile devices only for now - with a drop-down menu for other payment providers such as PayPal, Venmo, or the Cash App, the latter two of which are popular in the United States. But because the payment is made through those external systems, some Twitter users noticed that tipping a PayPal account lets the recipient know the postal address of the tip sender. In other cases, the recipient's email address could be seen, whether or not any money was sent. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

After security expert Rachel Tobac highlighted the issue, Twitter product lead Kayvon Beykpour thanked her for the ""good catch"" - but said Twitter could not control how PayPal handled that information. Instead, Twitter said it was updating the information around the tip jar to make clear that some details might be shared. PayPal, meanwhile, said the issue arose because the Twitter tip jar was using its ""goods and services"" payment option - which shares details for shipping those goods. It said people can toggle to the ""friends and family"" option during payment to avoid the issue. The tip jar function also has support for Bandcamp - widely used by musicians - and Patreon, used by all sorts of independent digital creators such as YouTubers and podcasters. Twitter says the addition was inspired by people who added payment links or Patreon ads in replies to viral tweets. ""We $ee you - sharing your PayPal link after your Tweet goes viral, adding your $Cashtag to your profile so people can support your work, dropping your Venmo handle on your birthday or if you just need some extra help,"" wrote Twitter's senior product manager Esther Crawford in the blog post announcing the feature,external. It said more people would be able to add the function to their profile ""soon"". But there are some concerns about the way the function will be used. Journalists, in particular, are often banned from accepting gifts - and it's not clear how ""tips"" will be treated by news organisations. ""Seems like Twitter's tip jar feature is going to raise some issues for newsrooms,"" tweeted Ryan Lizza, Politico's Washington correspondent. Allow Twitter content?

"Nicola Sturgeon easily saw off a challenge from Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar in her Glasgow Southside constituency The SNP has won three key seats but its hopes of securing an overall majority in the Scottish Parliament election remain on a knife edge. The party has taken both Edinburgh Central - where former MP Angus Robertson was standing for the SNP - and Ayr from the Conservatives. It also won the East Lothian seat from Labour. But it fell short in other targets, with counting in the remaining seats due to resume on Saturday. No other constituencies have changed hands so far, with the SNP currently on 39 seats, the Liberal Democrats four, Tories two and Labour one. But the opposition parties will see their number of seats increase dramatically once the regional list results are finalised on Saturday. The story of the Scottish election so far Scottish election results in maps and charts Full details of the results from across Scotland,external Polling expert Prof Sir John Curtice said it was now unlikely, but not impossible, that the SNP would achieve an overall majority in the new Holyrood parliament. And he said there were clear signs that tactical voting by pro-UK voters in some parts of the country had been successful. The Alba Party, which was founded by former first minister and SNP leader Alex Salmond, looks unlikely to win any seats.

As the count resumed on Saturday, Aberdeenshire East was first to declare with the SNP's Gillian Martin holding her seat with a reduced majority of 1,889 over the Scottish Conservatives - who increased their vote share by 11%. Friday's results included First Minister Nicola Sturgeon - the SNP leader - easily holding off a challenge from Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar in her Glasgow Southside constituency. Ms Sturgeon won by 9,456 votes, only marginally lower than the 9,593 she won by in 2016. Turnout has been higher than anticipated in many areas, with the SNP's share of the vote falling in many of the early constituencies to declare but increasing in others. The A-Z of Scotland's constituencies,external When will we know the result of the Scottish election? BBC Scotland election results coverage When will my seat declare? Ms Sturgeon said that the SNP ""appears to be on course for a fourth consecutive election victory and to be on course to have the privilege of forming a government again"". She pledged to ""get back to work immediately"" and lead the country's Covid recovery. ""And then, when the time is right, to offer this country the choice of a better future,"" she added. It comes as UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson suggested he would reject any calls for a second independence referendum, saying it would be ""irresponsible and reckless"" right now. Asked if an SNP majority would mean there was a mandate for another vote, he toldthe Daily Telegraph,external: ""I think that count is still taking place and we'll have to see what happens. I listened to the Scottish election carefully. My impression was that they [the SNP] moved away from the idea of a referendum, and I think very wisely. ""I don't think this is anything like the time to have more constitutional wrangling, to be talking about ripping our country apart, when actually people want to heal our economy and bounce forward together. That's what people want."" John Swinney told BBC Breakfast he was 'confident' there would be a pro-independence majority However deputy first minister John Swinney toldBBC Breakfastthat his party would legislate for a second referendum if Mr Johnson were to block one. He said: ""We've said we will take forward legislation to have a legal referendum - we already have put in place some of the legislative arrangements for that process. We will embark on such an agenda should there be a majority for such a proposition in the Scottish Parliament."" Mr Swinney said that although he was waiting to see the ""electoral arithmetic"" of the final results, he was ""very confident"" there would be a majority of candidates ""elected on a programme to deliver a referendum on independence"". This election has a long way to go with a further 26 constituencies and all 56 regional list seats still to declare. While the SNP is on course to finish as the largest party, there are only limited opportunities left for them to do so with an overall majority. To achieve that they really need to hold all they have and pick up an additional constituency seat like Aberdeenshire West, where the Conservatives are defending a majority of 900 votes. There is also a possible pathway if they do better than expected on the regional lists which are very hard to predict because of the proportional voting system. If the SNP fall short of that outright majority they could enter a fourth term in office as a minority government (as they are now) or seek a more formal arrangement with another party - most likely the Greens. Together the SNP and the Greens will almost certainly have a pro-independence majority at Holyrood - committed to holding another referendum that the UK government seems determined to resist. A big wrangle over indyref2 is coming and it could end up in the UK Supreme Court. The constituencies that declared on Friday included eight of the SNP's top 10 target seats. The Conservatives held Dumfriesshire, which had been one of the SNP's goals, with Oliver Mundell increasing his majority, while Jackson Carlaw held the marginal Eastwood seat for the Tories from the SNP. And Labour's Daniel Johnson held off the SNP challenge in Edinburgh Southern and the party's deputy leader Jackie Baillie increased her majority over the SNP in Dumbarton. Labour increase majority in Dumbarton Jackson suspended over Yousaf confrontation Salmond says Alba may not win any seats Robertson takes Davidson's former seat The election is seen as being crucial to the future of the UK as the result could impact on whether or not there is a second referendum on Scottish independence. The SNP - which has formed the devolved Scottish government since 2007 -  will once again finish as the largest party, but is seeking to win an overall majority to strengthen the case for indyref2. Although it is not yet clear that it will win a majority by itself, there is likely to be a pro-independence majority in the parliament once the Scottish Greens are allocated regional list seats on Saturday.

"Nicola Sturgeon was involved in a tense confrontation with a far-right candidate as she visited a polling station in the south of Glasgow. The SNP leader was praised on social media for how she handled an approach from a former deputy leader of Britain First. Jayda Fransen accused Ms Sturgeon of ""flooding"" the country with immigrants. Footage posted online showed the first minister call Ms Fransen ""a fascist and a racist"". Ms Fransen, who has convictions for religiously aggravated harassment, is an independent candidate in Glasgow Southside, the same constituency  as Nicola Sturgeon. On Thursday evening, a video was widely shared on social media showing Ms Fransen approach Ms Sturgeon in the street. She said: ""What are you sorry for? Mass immigration, Marxism?

I've been on the ground speaking to locals who say you are an absolute disgrace ..."" Ms Sturgeon said: ""We'll see what the locals' view is later on."" Ms Fransen said: ""The locals, what the ones you have flooded from other countries? ""The decent people of Scotland don't want it flooded with immigrants."" Ms Sturgeon then told her: ""You are a fascist, you are a racist and the southside of Glasgow will reject you."" The first minister then walked away with party members as Ms Fransen pursued her, talking about ""mass immigration"" and ""Marxism"". Ms Fransen later told an SNP supporter who asked her who she was: ""I'm not fascist, just a normal, decent unionist patriot. My grandfather fought the Nazis."" In a piece to camera uploaded afterwards by the British Freedom Party, she accused Ms Sturgeon of ""running away like a coward"", adding: ""Of course if you flood a constituency with foreigners and hardline republicans who absolutely hate Britain, hate the Union, they are going to secure their votes. ""The unionist community are no longer unrepresented and we are coming for you."" Jayda Fransen, pictured outside court in 2018, was convicted for comments made in Northern Ireland in 2017 Ms Fransen has previously been pictured outside the constituency office of Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf holding a sign saying ""it's okay to be white"" and has said she is running against the ""SNP commie, Marxists, naughty people"". She has previously been convicted of a number of religiously aggravated crimes, including harassment in both 2016 and 2018 - the latter of which saw her sentenced to 36 weeks in prison. Although a member of the British Freedom Party, documents from Glasgow City Council show Ms Fransen is running as an independent. The video was shared by Nicola Sturgeon, who said: ""Glasgow Southside is the most diverse and multi-cultural constituency in Scotland - one of the many things that makes it so brilliant. I am confident it will unite today to utterly reject these fascists."" RESULTS:Full details from across Scotland,external WHEN:Why is there no counting overnight?

"The SNP will form the next Holyrood government having won 64 seats - just one short of an overall majority Party leader and first minister Nicola Sturgeon says she wants to see the country through the pandemic and then ""give people in Scotland the right to choose their future"" With all results declared, the Scottish Conservatives have secured 31 seats (no change); Scottish Labour 22 (-2); Scottish Greens 8 (+2) and Scottish Lib Dems 4 (-1) Smaller parties, including former Scottish first minister Alex Salmond's Alba and George Galloway's All for Unity, won nothing The turnout of 66% is the highest since the parliament was established in 1999 BBC Scotland News The final results are in after a second day of counting in the Scottish Parliament election. Here are the key points: Glenn CampbellBBC Scotland Political Editor Having secured a fourth term in power for the SNP, Nicola
Sturgeon is not short of things to do as first minister. She has to form a government - that could be another
SNP-only administration, unless she wants to explore a more formal arrangement
with the independence-supporting Greens to secure an outright majority. She has to reshuffle her ministers, with four cabinet
posts - including that of health secretary - needing filled as a result of
retirements. There are also important decisions that need to be taken
on coronavirus - with a further easing of restrictions due on 17 May, plans
to reopen international travel to consider and concern over Covid cases in
Moray to address. Ms Sturgeon has insisted that dealing with the pandemic
and its aftermath will be her immediate priority - although clearly she intends
to press the case for another independence referendum too. There are also formalities - being sworn in with the
other 128 MSPs on Thursday, before putting herself forward in parliament for
re-election as first minister the following week. SNP deputy leader Keith Brown:""It is a fantastic win for the SNP. We have won this election out the park and in the process secured a historic fourth term.  We have got perhaps the most exciting manifesto I have ever seen in the SNP, and we are looking forward to implementing those policies."" Scottish Conservative MSP Craig Hoy:""This is a very good result for the Scottish Conservatives. We asked the pro-UK majority to come behind us and stop the SNP getting a majority, and we have done that. They thought they would walk into it and we have deprived them of that."" Labour MP Ian Murray:""We came into this campaign looking to stop the rot. Anas Sarwar has led from the front and he has won this election in terms of the party leaders and has put Scottish Labour back on the park. We are optimistic and looking forward to the future now."" Scottish Greens co-leader Lorna Slater:âWith this record result, the Scottish Greens have grown
our votes and influence in Scotland at this election. Thatâs because while
other parties focused on short-term tactical voting, the Scottish Greens
conducted a positive campaign on a green recovery and tackling the climate
crisis."" Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie:""We have had some astonishing constituency results, with almost half the vote in Shetland, more in Orkney and North East Fife and the highest vote for any constituency since the formation of the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh Western. It is frustrating that we werenât able to move the dial in other constituencies and on the regional lists."" Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent The SNPâs victory in these elections means the party is
heading for at least 19 years in power. Thatâs remarkable. Some will be slightly disappointed at not achieving a
majority. But the fact there is a comfortable pro-independence majority means
the issue is going to continue to be a significant one in Scottish and UK politics for years. In Downing Street, the plan was always to say no to
indyref2. That hasnât changed today, meaning a big political and potentially
legal battle is coming. But maybe not immediately. Nicola Sturgeon has said her
immediate focus will be the pandemic. Thatâs one way in which the Scottish and
UK governments agree. Kirsten CampbellBBC Scotland political correspondent The sixth session of the Scottish Parliament is going to be
the most diverse yet. There will be more women than have ever been elected before, more
disabled MSPs and more politicians from minority ethnic backgrounds. A total of 58 female candidates have been successful. The previous high was 48, back in 1999. The SNP actively chose to replace MSPs who were standing down with
female candidates where possible. Labour too sought to promote women by zipping candidates,
alternating men and women on their party list. Leader Anas Sarwar, who by
rights should have topped the Glasgow list, ceded the top spot to Pauline
McNeill to set an example. The challenge for Holyrood will be to
retain this new cohort. Politics is a notoriously un-family-friendly business.
Four female MSPs with young children decided to stand down this year to
find a better work-life balance. With all the results in, the SNP has won a fourth consecutive victory in the Scottish Parliament election. The party finished on 64 seats - one more than in 2016, but one short of an overall majority. The Conservatives won 31 seats, Labour 22, the Scottish Greens eight and Liberal Democrats four. You can check outall the results here. Professor Sir John CurticePolling expert The final share of the vote for the pro-independence parties combined on the two ballots is as follows:  This leaves plenty of room for argument as to whether or not this election did register majority support for the idea of holding another referendum on independence. Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor For a minority SNP administration, Greens are vital to Holyrood voting
through an independence referendum. There is much that the two sides can
agree on, including action on climate change. The
Greens could hope to force a faster pace of reduction
in emissions, pushing for more spend on public transport, less on roads, and
improved energy efficiency in homes and public buildings. The tensions are more likely to be around
oil and gas. The SNP is signed up to a transition
from burning fossil fuels to renewable energy, but it is more cautious than the Greens about the speed of winding down the oil and gas sector. That has become politically
sensitive in the Holyrood election. Tactical voting has
underlined the battle between the SNP and Tories in north east Scotland, once the SNPâs heartland. Since last yearâs plummet in the oil price, the SNP cannot
be seen to be too negative about the offshore industry without having a strong
and credible message about the transition and securing jobs. The Greens could hope to make progress, as
they claim to have done in 2018, in shifting tax policy. Their
manifesto was in favour of a shift to taxing wealth. That would include reform of council tax and business
rates, to base tax on land and asset values. The SNP has wanted to replace
council tax as well, but has given up on proposing a clear alternative in the
hope of cross-party agreement. It would be wary of major reforms, for the risk of
political backlash from those who lose out. Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor Nicola Sturgeon will be looking for allies to support her minority government The election of another SNP minority government opens up
questions of where it would build a coalition or shifting alliances needed to secure
votes, legislation and budgets. Having
done so as a minority administration between 2007 and 2011, and again since 2016,
it has a lot of experience in making that happen. And
having built up a rapport in the most recent parliament with Scottish Greens,
on budgets as well as independence, that is the obvious place to look for the
big votes. Greens
point out the sessions when the SNP relied more on
Conservative MSPs to get its business through. A
coalition would likely involve a formal deal on legislation. Deals between Labour and Lib Dems in 1999 and 2003 were brokered by
civil servants and depended heavily on finding common ground in manifestos. The Lib Dems
secured a disproportionately large number
of ministerial jobs, and held a veto over Labour on unforeseen votes. With their experience of minority government, it seems unlikely the SNP would go for that arrangement unless forced. The Scottish Greens would also be wary, if they look at the Lib Dems' track record at Holyrood and Westminster. Junior partners in coalitions can be burned by the compromises required. The SNP could look for a ""confidence and supply"" arrangement, to secure budgets and when other opposition parties put down motions of no confidence. But Greens have also been learning lessons about how to make the most of their leverage, and any such deal could be hard won by the SNP. Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar says his party are ""on a journey"" and ""back on the pitch"" despite being projected to finish with two fewer seats (22) than they achieved in the 2016 election. Mr Sarwar, who has only been in the role for 10 weeks, told BBC Scotland that time was not on his side - but that ""even his harshest critics"" would say the party has ""come a long way in that time"". ""I am happy compared to where we were 10 weeks ago, but am I satisfied in terms of where I want us to get to? Of course not,"" he said. ""We are on a journey and I recognise that.â Mr Sarwar, who returns to Holyrood on the Glasgow regional list, maintains Scottish Labour ""have a credibility again"" after a ""positive and energetic campaign"". ""We are back on the pitch and people arenât embarrassed anymore to say they vote Labour,"" he added. He also pledged to work with other parties to prioritise the country's recovery from the Covid crisis. Mr Sarwar also hailed the election of the first women of colour to Holyrood and the success of Labour's Pam Duncan-Glancy,  who will be the parliament's first permanent wheelchair user. The SNP won six of the nine constituency seats in the
Lothian region, meaning they did not pick up any additional members on the
regional list despite getting the most votes. The Conservatives got three seats on the list:  Labour won two:  Scottish Greens won two:  Full results here People have two votes in Scottish Parliament elections - one for a constituency MSP, and another for a regional ballot. There are 73 constituency MSPs, each elected on a first-past-the-post system similar to the UK general election - the winner is the candidate who receives the most votes in each constituency. In the regional ballot, people vote for a party. The parties are then allocated a number of MSPs depending on how many votes they receive - once the number of constituencies already won in that region is taken into account - to make the overall result more proportional. There are eight electoral regions, each with seven regional MSPs. These are:  This means that people in Scotland are each represented by eight MSPs - one representing their constituency and the other seven representing their region. The Scottish government is formed from the party that hold the most seats in the parliament, or alternatively a coalition of more than one party. It is led by the first minister, who appoints a number of ministers to be in charge of departments such as education, health and finance. Professor Sir John CurticePolling expert The South of Scotland result has now been officially declared. The SNP have managed to grab the last of the list seats in this region, so the party has managed to win 64 seats rather than 63. The SNP gained two extra constituency seats in the South Scotland
region â East Lothian and Ayr. Their success in the constituency â taking six of the nine
seats in the region â means they drop down from three regional list seats to just
one. The Conservatives, who lost the constituency seat of Ayr, picked up an extra regional list seat after a strong showing on the additional
member list. The seats in South of Scotland were: Conservative won three (up one):  Labour won three (up one):  SNP won one (down two) Professor Sir John CurticePolling expert In the aftermath of the Scottish Parliament election, there will doubtless be attempts by both sides of the constitutional debate to claim that their side of the argument is the more popular. However, it looks as though this is not a debate that either side can win. Given the results that are in so far, it looks as though the SNP plus the Greens are heading for 49% of the constituency vote, and that the SNP plus the Greens and Alba may win 51% of the list vote. In truth, the only safe conclusion one can draw from these results is that Scotland is indeed divided down the middle on the constitutional question. Alex Salmond has failed in his bid to return to the Scottish Parliament, as his Alba party missed out on a seat in the North East regional list Alba polled 8,269 votes in the region, 2.3% of the vote - well short of the number required to get an MSP. The former first minister and SNP leader had earlier conceded that his new party was unlikely to return any parliamentarians to Holyrood Mr Salmond says he will continue as party leader. In a statement he said the 32 Alba candidates had been ""injecting urgency"" into the need to deliver independence and that it intended to stay on the political scene. It plans to hold a conference in June and contest local elections in Scotland next year. The SNP won eight of the nine constituency seats in the Mid Scotland and Fife region, so did not get any MSPs under the additional member system. The Conservatives won four:  Labour won two:  Scottish Greens won one:  Full results here Professor Sir John CurticePolling expert With just one of the South Scotland constituencies to declare its list result, it looks as though it may be nip and tuck between Labour and the SNP for the last of the seven list seats. Labour might have a slightly better chance, but the SNP could yet edge it. If they were to do so then the party would end up on 64 seats rather than 63. In the North East, the list results were in line with predictions - four Conservatives, two Labour and one Green. BBC Radio Scotland Alistair Carmichael,
the Liberal Democratsâ MP for Orkney and Shetland since 2001, said the predicted outcome for Willie Rennie's Scottish party - which would see them drop from five seats to four in Holyrood - was a âdisappointing result, there
is no getting away from thatâ. Despite that, Mr Carmichael said there was nothing about the party's campaign ""for which we should be apologising or should be embarrassed"". He congratulated the SNP, and Nicola Sturgeon in particular, for âa quite
remarkable election outcomeâ. Ms Sturgeon was ""right"", he said, in saying she would prioritise
dealing with the pandemic first, but believed there were ""mixed messagesâ in
hercomments on an independence referendum, which âsuggested her mind might well be
elsewhereâ. As long as the first minister ""is prepared to
put the recovery first, then she will get a fair hearing from us,"" Mr Carmichael told BBC Radio Scotland. Pam Gosal Pam Gosal has become the second woman of colour to be elected to the Scottish Parliament. The Conservative candidate was elected as an MSP via the Glasgow list. Earlier this year, Ms Gosal said she had experienced racist abuse throughout her life but said it would never stop her.Read more here. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Holidaymakers in England are to find out which ""green list"" countries they can visit without quarantining on their return later this afternoon. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps will unveil details of new travel rules at a coronavirus briefing at 17:00 BST. Rules will be based on a traffic light system, with countries rated green, amber or red based on their Covid risk. Currently, people in England face fines for holidaying abroad, and must have a valid reason for foreign travel. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have not said when they might ease their strict travel rules. How will the traffic light system work? Where can I go on holiday in the UK now? What are the current travel rules? The list of green countries with the fewest travel restrictions is expected to be small when the rules come into effect on 17 May. Travellers to countries rated green will not need to isolate on their return, but they will need to take a Covid test before and after their trip. Arrivals from amber countries will need to quarantine, while red-list countries have the strictest rules, with only UK or Irish nationals, or UK residents, allowed to return - and they must pay for a 10-day stay in a government quarantine hotel. Countries will be categorised based on their number of Covid cases and the success of vaccine rollouts. At the moment, the UK has fewer cases and a higher rate of vaccinations than many popular destinations, including France, Spain, Greece and Turkey. Infections in Portugal are at a similar level to that in the UK, with 27 confirmed virus cases per 100,000 people per week compared with 21 in the UK, according to figures from Our World in Data from 4 May. The UK government previously said the travel rules will be reviewed again on 28 June to see whether any measures can be relaxed further. The chief executive of Booking.com warned thattravel prices would risedue to pent-up demand and fewer planes in service. While the UK's largest tour operator, Tui,has said it will subsidise the cost of Covid testingfor its customers, offering test packages for between Â£20 and Â£90. Ahead of the transport secretary's announcement, airline giant IAG, which owns British Airways,said it was ""ready to fly""but urged the government to introduce affordable, simple and proportionate testing to replace quarantine. Meanwhile, a coronavirus variant first detected in India has been escalated to a ""variant of concern"" by Public Health England, as scientists believe it is at least as transmissible as the Kent variant. India is currently on the red list of countries, with people only able to enter the United Kingdom from there if they are a British or Irish national, or UK resident.

"This video can not be played Mark Drakeford is set to remain as first minister of Wales as his party wins 30 seats in the Senedd Labour is set to stay in power in Wales after matching its best-ever Senedd election result, with exactly half of the 60 seats in the Welsh Parliament. The Tories took the Vale of Clwyd from Labour, and Brecon and Radnorshire from the Liberal Democrats. Labour held firm in other Tory target seats and took Rhondda back from Plaid Cymru. Leader Mark Drakeford, who extended the majority in his seat, vowed to form a ""stable and progressive"" government.

Current first minister Mr Drakeford,who raised his majority in his Cardiff West seat by 12.7 points and more than 6,000 votes, told BBC Wales he would ""do whatever I can"" to ensure Wales has a ""stable and progressive"" government. He added he would prefer to be in a position ""where you have a government that is able to command a majority for the action that it needs to take on the floor of the Senedd"". He added: ""Without trying to rush a decision at this time on a Friday we'll take a couple of days to make sure that we make the best decision that we can for Wales."" Allow Twitter content?

Labour also regained Rhondda from Plaid Cymru, toppling its former leader Leanne Wood. Her win there in 2016 was one of the major upsets of the last Senedd election but Labour's Buffy Williams overturned it with a 19% swing and a majority of more than 5,000. Ben Lake, the Plaid Cymru MP for Ceredigion, said losing the Rhondda seat was a ""terrible blow for the party"". Asked if the party could still play a role in a coalition with Labour if required, he said it was a ""dead duck"". ""The people of Wales have sent a very clear message at the election, and I can't see it being feasible or indeed desirable on the part of either party,"" he toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfast. Plaid Cymru has won five constituency seats, holding on to Arfon, Dwyfor Meirionnydd, Ynys Mon, Ceredigion, and Carmarthen East and Dinefwr. With three of the five regional list results declared so far, Plaid has won four list seats, the Conservatives four, Labour three and the Liberal Democrats one. The Conservatives held on to Montgomeryshire, Aberconwy, Clwyd West, Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire, and Preseli Pembrokeshire. The party also kept Monmouth where ex-Monmouthshire council leader Peter Fox is its new incumbent following the deselection of Nick Ramsay. But the Tories failed to capture the Vale of Glamorgan, another Labour-held target seat which is Conservative at Westminster.

Labour also held on to the Plaid Cymru target seat of Llanelli, with Welsh government deputy transport minister Lee Waters being re-elected. Following his victory, Mr Waters said Mark Drakeford was ""definitely an asset"", due to his leadership during the pandemic. ""He may not be flashy, he may be a bit nerdy, a bit boring, he's a university professor, but thank God for him,"" he said. Health Minister Vaughan Gething also paid tribute to his party leader, saying: ""The recognition of the way Mark has run the Welsh government in this extraordinary time was undoubtedly a factor in the way that people have voted."" How to organise an election in a pandemic A really simple guide to the Welsh elections Five things to find out from the Welsh election Despite the challenges of the pandemic, more than 1.1 million people voted, making it the highest-ever turnout for a Senedd election at 46.6%. This beat the previous record of 46.3% at the first Senedd election in 1999, but is still significantly lower than turnout for general elections. Laura McAllister, professor of public policy at Cardiff University, said Labour had ""performed better than most people expected"". ""After 22 years in power, with a Conservative Party that was really strongly tipped to make significant breakthroughs, and of course Plaid Cymru biting its ankles as well, that's some achievement."" Political commentator Prof Roger Awan-Scully said: ""I think it's been an astonishingly resilient performance by the Welsh Labour Party, amidst disasters for Labour elsewhere in the UK. ""The Conservatives are also performing strongly, but not quite bringing it home in terms of the number of constituency victories that they might have expected. ""For Plaid Cymru I think this has to be said to be a deeply disappointing election."" Gareth Davies thanked voters for their trust in him The Vale of Clwyd was the only Conservative gain in Labour's ""red wall"" of seats in north Wales where the Tories had enjoyed success in the 2019 General Election. Winning candidate Gareth Davies, an NHS physiotherapist, said: ""It's a magnificent achievement. ""In 1999 I was a small boy, and now I'm in my 30s and I never thought back then I'd ever be in this position. So I feel really humbled."" Andrew RT Davies, leader of the Tories in the Senedd, said the result in the Vale of Clwyd was ""fantastic"". North Wales has been a fiercely contested battleground, with re-elected Aberconwy Tory MS Janet Finch-Saunders sayingshe had been ""horrified""by personal attacks which had hurt her family during the campaign. Labour's win in Alyn and Deeside represents the last of the red wall seats that the Conservatives had hoped to take in north east Wales. It's the last brick in the wall. But they have only managed in this election to take Vale of Clwyd in that region - by a small amount. So it counts as a disappointing set of results for the Conservatives. Labour, which has been in charge of the Welsh government for 22 years, is now set to remain in power for a sixth term with exactly half the seats in the Senedd chamber. Of the 60 members of the Senedd (MSs) being elected, 40 will serve constituencies and 20 will be elected to represent larger regional areas of North Wales, Mid and West Wales, South Wales West, South Wales Central and South Wales East. A party needs to win 31 seats to claim a majority but it has never happened, with Labour last time having 29 seats. It previously won 30 seats in 2003 and 2011. Social distancing and other Covid measures have delayed the count in many areas For Plaid Cymru, the party's Westminster leader Liz Saville Roberts painted a gloomy picture for their hopes of making inroads into Labour's grip on the south Wales valleys. She said the pandemic had meant ""ministers in the governments, both in Westminster and Cardiff, have had an immense platform over the last year"". It had been an ""extraordinarily different"" election, Ms Saville Roberts said, ""to anything that anybody has been used to, and it's been difficult for a party like Plaid to get the same sort of platform"". ""At the same time there's a real sense that our policy, our offer of policies, has offered something that was progressive and new and is, I hope, really the seeds for something in the future,"" she added. Adam Price, who held Carmarthen East and Dinefwr with a reduced majority, said he would not stand down as Plaid Cymru leader. Adam Price was re-elected in Carmarthen East and Dinefwr but saw his majority fall Despite no gains, Mr Price said the party had increased its share of the vote and its stance on independence had been a ""net positive"". ""I'm not walking away from anything, because this is the moment when Wales needs leadership,"" he said. ""This is a historic challenge, because of the way that the politics is moving in this island, but it's also a historic opportunity for us. ""We can move our nation forward and I'm looking forward to playing my part, it's not something that anyone can do on their own. ""I have a role to play, we all have a role to play and that's what's exciting about politics at the moment. Wales is on the move Wales is on the march. I'm going to be part of that.""

Liberal Democrat peer Baroness Jenny Randerson said she did not think Welsh Labour would need the support of Ms Dodds to run a government as had happened with her predecessor, former Education Minister Kirsty Williams who stood down prior to the elections. ""I think Labour will have the numbers to just about manage on their own,"" said Baroness Randerson. Ian Price, director of CBI Wales, congratulated Labour. ""This is a critical time for the Welsh economy and the new parliament must have a laser-like focus on rebuilding from the devastating impact of the pandemic,"" he said. ""That means all parties pulling together and working with business to protect jobs, rebuild livelihoods and create a fair and sustainable recovery that addresses the longstanding structural challenges our economy faces."" The Abolish the Welsh Assembly Party was also hoping to make a breakthrough in the regional lists.

"The Array Collective at Pride 2019 (left) and Project Art Works' Siddharth Gadiyar at the Phoenix Art Space The 2021 Turner Prize nominees are, for the first time, made up of collectives who have helped to ""inspire social change through art"", organisers say. Exhibitions have been largely closed over the past year due to the pandemic. With that in mind, Friday's shortlist contained the names of five groups who continued to work in the community. Prize chair and Tate Britain director Alex Farquharson said it is intended to capture and reflect the mood of the moment in contemporary British art. ""After a year of lockdowns when very few artists have been able to exhibit publicly, the jury has selected five outstanding collectives whose work has not only continued through the pandemic but become even more relevant as a result,"" he said in a statement. The efforts - by Array Collective, Black Obsidian Sound System (B.O.S.S.), Cooking Sections, Gentle/Radical and Project Arts Works - have included artwork in support of law changes in Northern Ireland, a 24-hour fundraising rave for queer, trans and intersex black and people of colour, and the use of food to help understand the workings of the world. As well as a lockdown doorstep neighbourhood story-telling campaign and work by a group of neurodiverse artists. Last year's Turner Prize didn't happen at all due to the effects of coronavirus and it was instead replaced by a fund for struggling artists. In 2019,the prize pot was split four waysat the nominees' request. Eventual joint-winners Lawrence Abu Hamdan, Helen Cammock, Tai Shani and Oscar Murillo said they wanted to make a ""collective statement"" at a time when there was ""already so much that divides and isolates people and communities"" - a nod to the fall-out from the Brexit referendum. This year is the first time a Turner Prize jury has selected a shortlist comprising entirely of artist collectives, who the judges say have all showed ""solidarity"" with various communities across the UK during a difficult 12 months. Array Collective on International Women's Day in 2019 Array Collectiveare a group of Belfast-based artists whose work tackles issues affecting Northern Ireland. Their work encompasses performances, protests, exhibitions and events. The jury commended the way it ""fuses seriousness with humour, and addresses contemporary issues using ancient folk imagery"". Recent projects have included public artworks in support of the decriminalisation of abortion in Northern Ireland, challenging legislative discrimination of the queer community, and participation in the group exhibition Jerwood Collaborate! in London. A portrait of B.O.S.S. artists The English capital is whereBlack Obsidian Sound System (B.O.S.S.)are based, and they work across art, sound and radical activism. Formed by and for QTIBPOC (queer, trans and intersex black and people of colour), the group aims to challenge the perceived norms of sound-system culture across African communities In London - through club nights, art installations, technical workshops and a film documenting QTIBPOC nightlife. Judges praised their live performances - they've put on events at Somerset House - and ""their commitment to community"", including an online 24-hour fundraising rave. A portrait of the Cooking Sections artists Cooking Sectionsare the other London-based nominees and they examine the systems that organise the world through food. Using installation, performance and video, they explore the overlapping boundaries between art, architecture, ecology and geopolitics. Turner Prize officials applauded the ingenuity of their long-term CLIMAVORE project, which asks questions about how our diet can respond to the climate emergency. The duo put on a sound, light and sculpture installation at Tate Britain last year, reflecting on salmon farming, as well as an ongoing installation-performance on the Isle of Skye which sees an underwater oyster table turn into a community dining space at low tide. Gentle/Radical's Doorstep Revolution Over in the Cardiff,Gentle/Radical- made up of artists, community workers, performers, faith practitioners, writers and others - are advocating for art as a tool for social change. They create real and virtual spaces for communities in Wales to engage with culture, such as the creation a pop-up cinema space showing independent films. Their ongoing Doorstep Revolution helped people to share neighbourhood stories during lockdown. The jury admired their ""deep commitment"" to the hyper-local community of their native Riverside. Illuminating the Wilderness found Project Art Works on location in Glen Affric, Scotland Last but not least,Project Art Worksare a collective of neurodiverse artists and makers based in Hastings. Neurodiversity is defined as autistic or other neurologically atypical patterns of thought or behaviour. They explore art through collaborative practice with, for and by neurominorities - and their work appears in exhibitions, events, films and online. Their recent film, Illuminating the Wilderness, followed members of the collective and their families and carers exploring a remote Scottish glen. The jury praised their continuing work at Hastings Contemporary, where passers-by could continue to view work in lockdown by looking through the windows of the closed gallery. An exhibition of all five Turner Prize nominees work will be held at the Herbert Art Gallery and Museum in Coventry from 29 September until 12 January 2022, as part of the UK City of Culture 2021 celebrations.

"The SNP will form the next Holyrood government having won 64 seats - just one short of an overall majority Party leader and first minister Nicola Sturgeon says she wants to see the country through the pandemic and then ""give people in Scotland the right to choose their future"" With all results declared, the Scottish Conservatives have secured 31 seats (no change); Scottish Labour 22 (-2); Scottish Greens 8 (+2) and Scottish Lib Dems 4 (-1) Smaller parties, including former Scottish first minister Alex Salmond's Alba and George Galloway's All for Unity, won nothing The turnout of 66% is the highest since the parliament was established in 1999 BBC Scotland News The final results are in after a second day of counting in the Scottish Parliament election. Here are the key points: Glenn CampbellBBC Scotland Political Editor Having secured a fourth term in power for the SNP, Nicola
Sturgeon is not short of things to do as first minister. She has to form a government - that could be another
SNP-only administration, unless she wants to explore a more formal arrangement
with the independence-supporting Greens to secure an outright majority. She has to reshuffle her ministers, with four cabinet
posts - including that of health secretary - needing filled as a result of
retirements. There are also important decisions that need to be taken
on coronavirus - with a further easing of restrictions due on 17 May, plans
to reopen international travel to consider and concern over Covid cases in
Moray to address. Ms Sturgeon has insisted that dealing with the pandemic
and its aftermath will be her immediate priority - although clearly she intends
to press the case for another independence referendum too. There are also formalities - being sworn in with the
other 128 MSPs on Thursday, before putting herself forward in parliament for
re-election as first minister the following week. SNP deputy leader Keith Brown:""It is a fantastic win for the SNP. We have won this election out the park and in the process secured a historic fourth term.  We have got perhaps the most exciting manifesto I have ever seen in the SNP, and we are looking forward to implementing those policies."" Scottish Conservative MSP Craig Hoy:""This is a very good result for the Scottish Conservatives. We asked the pro-UK majority to come behind us and stop the SNP getting a majority, and we have done that. They thought they would walk into it and we have deprived them of that."" Labour MP Ian Murray:""We came into this campaign looking to stop the rot. Anas Sarwar has led from the front and he has won this election in terms of the party leaders and has put Scottish Labour back on the park. We are optimistic and looking forward to the future now."" Scottish Greens co-leader Lorna Slater:âWith this record result, the Scottish Greens have grown
our votes and influence in Scotland at this election. Thatâs because while
other parties focused on short-term tactical voting, the Scottish Greens
conducted a positive campaign on a green recovery and tackling the climate
crisis."" Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie:""We have had some astonishing constituency results, with almost half the vote in Shetland, more in Orkney and North East Fife and the highest vote for any constituency since the formation of the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh Western. It is frustrating that we werenât able to move the dial in other constituencies and on the regional lists."" Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent The SNPâs victory in these elections means the party is
heading for at least 19 years in power. Thatâs remarkable. Some will be slightly disappointed at not achieving a
majority. But the fact there is a comfortable pro-independence majority means
the issue is going to continue to be a significant one in Scottish and UK politics for years. In Downing Street, the plan was always to say no to
indyref2. That hasnât changed today, meaning a big political and potentially
legal battle is coming. But maybe not immediately. Nicola Sturgeon has said her
immediate focus will be the pandemic. Thatâs one way in which the Scottish and
UK governments agree. Kirsten CampbellBBC Scotland political correspondent The sixth session of the Scottish Parliament is going to be
the most diverse yet. There will be more women than have ever been elected before, more
disabled MSPs and more politicians from minority ethnic backgrounds. A total of 58 female candidates have been successful. The previous high was 48, back in 1999. The SNP actively chose to replace MSPs who were standing down with
female candidates where possible. Labour too sought to promote women by zipping candidates,
alternating men and women on their party list. Leader Anas Sarwar, who by
rights should have topped the Glasgow list, ceded the top spot to Pauline
McNeill to set an example. The challenge for Holyrood will be to
retain this new cohort. Politics is a notoriously un-family-friendly business.
Four female MSPs with young children decided to stand down this year to
find a better work-life balance. With all the results in, the SNP has won a fourth consecutive victory in the Scottish Parliament election. The party finished on 64 seats - one more than in 2016, but one short of an overall majority. The Conservatives won 31 seats, Labour 22, the Scottish Greens eight and Liberal Democrats four. You can check outall the results here. Professor Sir John CurticePolling expert The final share of the vote for the pro-independence parties combined on the two ballots is as follows:  This leaves plenty of room for argument as to whether or not this election did register majority support for the idea of holding another referendum on independence. Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor For a minority SNP administration, Greens are vital to Holyrood voting
through an independence referendum. There is much that the two sides can
agree on, including action on climate change. The
Greens could hope to force a faster pace of reduction
in emissions, pushing for more spend on public transport, less on roads, and
improved energy efficiency in homes and public buildings. The tensions are more likely to be around
oil and gas. The SNP is signed up to a transition
from burning fossil fuels to renewable energy, but it is more cautious than the Greens about the speed of winding down the oil and gas sector. That has become politically
sensitive in the Holyrood election. Tactical voting has
underlined the battle between the SNP and Tories in north east Scotland, once the SNPâs heartland. Since last yearâs plummet in the oil price, the SNP cannot
be seen to be too negative about the offshore industry without having a strong
and credible message about the transition and securing jobs. The Greens could hope to make progress, as
they claim to have done in 2018, in shifting tax policy. Their
manifesto was in favour of a shift to taxing wealth. That would include reform of council tax and business
rates, to base tax on land and asset values. The SNP has wanted to replace
council tax as well, but has given up on proposing a clear alternative in the
hope of cross-party agreement. It would be wary of major reforms, for the risk of
political backlash from those who lose out. Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor Nicola Sturgeon will be looking for allies to support her minority government The election of another SNP minority government opens up
questions of where it would build a coalition or shifting alliances needed to secure
votes, legislation and budgets. Having
done so as a minority administration between 2007 and 2011, and again since 2016,
it has a lot of experience in making that happen. And
having built up a rapport in the most recent parliament with Scottish Greens,
on budgets as well as independence, that is the obvious place to look for the
big votes. Greens
point out the sessions when the SNP relied more on
Conservative MSPs to get its business through. A
coalition would likely involve a formal deal on legislation. Deals between Labour and Lib Dems in 1999 and 2003 were brokered by
civil servants and depended heavily on finding common ground in manifestos. The Lib Dems
secured a disproportionately large number
of ministerial jobs, and held a veto over Labour on unforeseen votes. With their experience of minority government, it seems unlikely the SNP would go for that arrangement unless forced. The Scottish Greens would also be wary, if they look at the Lib Dems' track record at Holyrood and Westminster. Junior partners in coalitions can be burned by the compromises required. The SNP could look for a ""confidence and supply"" arrangement, to secure budgets and when other opposition parties put down motions of no confidence. But Greens have also been learning lessons about how to make the most of their leverage, and any such deal could be hard won by the SNP. Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar says his party are ""on a journey"" and ""back on the pitch"" despite being projected to finish with two fewer seats (22) than they achieved in the 2016 election. Mr Sarwar, who has only been in the role for 10 weeks, told BBC Scotland that time was not on his side - but that ""even his harshest critics"" would say the party has ""come a long way in that time"". ""I am happy compared to where we were 10 weeks ago, but am I satisfied in terms of where I want us to get to? Of course not,"" he said. ""We are on a journey and I recognise that.â Mr Sarwar, who returns to Holyrood on the Glasgow regional list, maintains Scottish Labour ""have a credibility again"" after a ""positive and energetic campaign"". ""We are back on the pitch and people arenât embarrassed anymore to say they vote Labour,"" he added. He also pledged to work with other parties to prioritise the country's recovery from the Covid crisis. Mr Sarwar also hailed the election of the first women of colour to Holyrood and the success of Labour's Pam Duncan-Glancy,  who will be the parliament's first permanent wheelchair user. The SNP won six of the nine constituency seats in the
Lothian region, meaning they did not pick up any additional members on the
regional list despite getting the most votes. The Conservatives got three seats on the list:  Labour won two:  Scottish Greens won two:  Full results here People have two votes in Scottish Parliament elections - one for a constituency MSP, and another for a regional ballot. There are 73 constituency MSPs, each elected on a first-past-the-post system similar to the UK general election - the winner is the candidate who receives the most votes in each constituency. In the regional ballot, people vote for a party. The parties are then allocated a number of MSPs depending on how many votes they receive - once the number of constituencies already won in that region is taken into account - to make the overall result more proportional. There are eight electoral regions, each with seven regional MSPs. These are:  This means that people in Scotland are each represented by eight MSPs - one representing their constituency and the other seven representing their region. The Scottish government is formed from the party that hold the most seats in the parliament, or alternatively a coalition of more than one party. It is led by the first minister, who appoints a number of ministers to be in charge of departments such as education, health and finance. Professor Sir John CurticePolling expert The South of Scotland result has now been officially declared. The SNP have managed to grab the last of the list seats in this region, so the party has managed to win 64 seats rather than 63. The SNP gained two extra constituency seats in the South Scotland
region â East Lothian and Ayr. Their success in the constituency â taking six of the nine
seats in the region â means they drop down from three regional list seats to just
one. The Conservatives, who lost the constituency seat of Ayr, picked up an extra regional list seat after a strong showing on the additional
member list. The seats in South of Scotland were: Conservative won three (up one):  Labour won three (up one):  SNP won one (down two) Professor Sir John CurticePolling expert In the aftermath of the Scottish Parliament election, there will doubtless be attempts by both sides of the constitutional debate to claim that their side of the argument is the more popular. However, it looks as though this is not a debate that either side can win. Given the results that are in so far, it looks as though the SNP plus the Greens are heading for 49% of the constituency vote, and that the SNP plus the Greens and Alba may win 51% of the list vote. In truth, the only safe conclusion one can draw from these results is that Scotland is indeed divided down the middle on the constitutional question. Alex Salmond has failed in his bid to return to the Scottish Parliament, as his Alba party missed out on a seat in the North East regional list Alba polled 8,269 votes in the region, 2.3% of the vote - well short of the number required to get an MSP. The former first minister and SNP leader had earlier conceded that his new party was unlikely to return any parliamentarians to Holyrood Mr Salmond says he will continue as party leader. In a statement he said the 32 Alba candidates had been ""injecting urgency"" into the need to deliver independence and that it intended to stay on the political scene. It plans to hold a conference in June and contest local elections in Scotland next year. The SNP won eight of the nine constituency seats in the Mid Scotland and Fife region, so did not get any MSPs under the additional member system. The Conservatives won four:  Labour won two:  Scottish Greens won one:  Full results here Professor Sir John CurticePolling expert With just one of the South Scotland constituencies to declare its list result, it looks as though it may be nip and tuck between Labour and the SNP for the last of the seven list seats. Labour might have a slightly better chance, but the SNP could yet edge it. If they were to do so then the party would end up on 64 seats rather than 63. In the North East, the list results were in line with predictions - four Conservatives, two Labour and one Green. BBC Radio Scotland Alistair Carmichael,
the Liberal Democratsâ MP for Orkney and Shetland since 2001, said the predicted outcome for Willie Rennie's Scottish party - which would see them drop from five seats to four in Holyrood - was a âdisappointing result, there
is no getting away from thatâ. Despite that, Mr Carmichael said there was nothing about the party's campaign ""for which we should be apologising or should be embarrassed"". He congratulated the SNP, and Nicola Sturgeon in particular, for âa quite
remarkable election outcomeâ. Ms Sturgeon was ""right"", he said, in saying she would prioritise
dealing with the pandemic first, but believed there were ""mixed messagesâ in
hercomments on an independence referendum, which âsuggested her mind might well be
elsewhereâ. As long as the first minister ""is prepared to
put the recovery first, then she will get a fair hearing from us,"" Mr Carmichael told BBC Radio Scotland. Pam Gosal Pam Gosal has become the second woman of colour to be elected to the Scottish Parliament. The Conservative candidate was elected as an MSP via the Glasgow list. Earlier this year, Ms Gosal said she had experienced racist abuse throughout her life but said it would never stop her.Read more here. Â© 2025 BBC.

""I am happy compared to where we were 10 weeks ago, but am I satisfied in terms of where I want us to get to? Of course not,"" he said. ""We are on a journey and I recognise that.â Mr Sarwar, who returns to Holyrood on the Glasgow regional list, maintains Scottish Labour ""have a credibility again"" after a ""positive and energetic campaign"". ""We are back on the pitch and people arenât embarrassed anymore to say they vote Labour,"" he added. He also pledged to work with other parties to prioritise the country's recovery from the Covid crisis. Mr Sarwar also hailed the election of the first women of colour to Holyrood and the success of Labour's Pam Duncan-Glancy,  who will be the parliament's first permanent wheelchair user. The SNP won six of the nine constituency seats in the
Lothian region, meaning they did not pick up any additional members on the
regional list despite getting the most votes. The Conservatives got three seats on the list:  Labour won two:  Scottish Greens won two:  Full results here People have two votes in Scottish Parliament elections - one for a constituency MSP, and another for a regional ballot. There are 73 constituency MSPs, each elected on a first-past-the-post system similar to the UK general election - the winner is the candidate who receives the most votes in each constituency. In the regional ballot, people vote for a party. The parties are then allocated a number of MSPs depending on how many votes they receive - once the number of constituencies already won in that region is taken into account - to make the overall result more proportional. There are eight electoral regions, each with seven regional MSPs. These are:  This means that people in Scotland are each represented by eight MSPs - one representing their constituency and the other seven representing their region. The Scottish government is formed from the party that hold the most seats in the parliament, or alternatively a coalition of more than one party. It is led by the first minister, who appoints a number of ministers to be in charge of departments such as education, health and finance. Professor Sir John CurticePolling expert The South of Scotland result has now been officially declared. The SNP have managed to grab the last of the list seats in this region, so the party has managed to win 64 seats rather than 63. The SNP gained two extra constituency seats in the South Scotland
region â East Lothian and Ayr. Their success in the constituency â taking six of the nine
seats in the region â means they drop down from three regional list seats to just
one. The Conservatives, who lost the constituency seat of Ayr, picked up an extra regional list seat after a strong showing on the additional
member list. The seats in South of Scotland were: Conservative won three (up one):  Labour won three (up one):  SNP won one (down two) Professor Sir John CurticePolling expert In the aftermath of the Scottish Parliament election, there will doubtless be attempts by both sides of the constitutional debate to claim that their side of the argument is the more popular. However, it looks as though this is not a debate that either side can win. Given the results that are in so far, it looks as though the SNP plus the Greens are heading for 49% of the constituency vote, and that the SNP plus the Greens and Alba may win 51% of the list vote. In truth, the only safe conclusion one can draw from these results is that Scotland is indeed divided down the middle on the constitutional question. Alex Salmond has failed in his bid to return to the Scottish Parliament, as his Alba party missed out on a seat in the North East regional list Alba polled 8,269 votes in the region, 2.3% of the vote - well short of the number required to get an MSP. The former first minister and SNP leader had earlier conceded that his new party was unlikely to return any parliamentarians to Holyrood Mr Salmond says he will continue as party leader. In a statement he said the 32 Alba candidates had been ""injecting urgency"" into the need to deliver independence and that it intended to stay on the political scene. It plans to hold a conference in June and contest local elections in Scotland next year. The SNP won eight of the nine constituency seats in the Mid Scotland and Fife region, so did not get any MSPs under the additional member system. The Conservatives won four:  Labour won two:  Scottish Greens won one:  Full results here Professor Sir John CurticePolling expert With just one of the South Scotland constituencies to declare its list result, it looks as though it may be nip and tuck between Labour and the SNP for the last of the seven list seats. Labour might have a slightly better chance, but the SNP could yet edge it. If they were to do so then the party would end up on 64 seats rather than 63. In the North East, the list results were in line with predictions - four Conservatives, two Labour and one Green. BBC Radio Scotland Alistair Carmichael,
the Liberal Democratsâ MP for Orkney and Shetland since 2001, said the predicted outcome for Willie Rennie's Scottish party - which would see them drop from five seats to four in Holyrood - was a âdisappointing result, there
is no getting away from thatâ. Despite that, Mr Carmichael said there was nothing about the party's campaign ""for which we should be apologising or should be embarrassed"". He congratulated the SNP, and Nicola Sturgeon in particular, for âa quite
remarkable election outcomeâ. Ms Sturgeon was ""right"", he said, in saying she would prioritise
dealing with the pandemic first, but believed there were ""mixed messagesâ in
hercomments on an independence referendum, which âsuggested her mind might well be
elsewhereâ. As long as the first minister ""is prepared to
put the recovery first, then she will get a fair hearing from us,"" Mr Carmichael told BBC Radio Scotland. Pam Gosal Pam Gosal has become the second woman of colour to be elected to the Scottish Parliament. The Conservative candidate was elected as an MSP via the Glasgow list.

"The SNP will form the next Holyrood government having won 64 seats - just one short of an overall majority Party leader and first minister Nicola Sturgeon says she wants to see the country through the pandemic and then ""give people in Scotland the right to choose their future"" With all results declared, the Scottish Conservatives have secured 31 seats (no change); Scottish Labour 22 (-2); Scottish Greens 8 (+2) and Scottish Lib Dems 4 (-1) Smaller parties, including former Scottish first minister Alex Salmond's Alba and George Galloway's All for Unity, won nothing The turnout of 66% is the highest since the parliament was established in 1999 BBC Scotland News The final results are in after a second day of counting in the Scottish Parliament election. Here are the key points: Glenn CampbellBBC Scotland Political Editor Having secured a fourth term in power for the SNP, Nicola
Sturgeon is not short of things to do as first minister. She has to form a government - that could be another
SNP-only administration, unless she wants to explore a more formal arrangement
with the independence-supporting Greens to secure an outright majority. She has to reshuffle her ministers, with four cabinet
posts - including that of health secretary - needing filled as a result of
retirements. There are also important decisions that need to be taken
on coronavirus - with a further easing of restrictions due on 17 May, plans
to reopen international travel to consider and concern over Covid cases in
Moray to address. Ms Sturgeon has insisted that dealing with the pandemic
and its aftermath will be her immediate priority - although clearly she intends
to press the case for another independence referendum too. There are also formalities - being sworn in with the
other 128 MSPs on Thursday, before putting herself forward in parliament for
re-election as first minister the following week. SNP deputy leader Keith Brown:""It is a fantastic win for the SNP. We have won this election out the park and in the process secured a historic fourth term.  We have got perhaps the most exciting manifesto I have ever seen in the SNP, and we are looking forward to implementing those policies."" Scottish Conservative MSP Craig Hoy:""This is a very good result for the Scottish Conservatives. We asked the pro-UK majority to come behind us and stop the SNP getting a majority, and we have done that. They thought they would walk into it and we have deprived them of that."" Labour MP Ian Murray:""We came into this campaign looking to stop the rot. Anas Sarwar has led from the front and he has won this election in terms of the party leaders and has put Scottish Labour back on the park. We are optimistic and looking forward to the future now."" Scottish Greens co-leader Lorna Slater:âWith this record result, the Scottish Greens have grown
our votes and influence in Scotland at this election. Thatâs because while
other parties focused on short-term tactical voting, the Scottish Greens
conducted a positive campaign on a green recovery and tackling the climate
crisis."" Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie:""We have had some astonishing constituency results, with almost half the vote in Shetland, more in Orkney and North East Fife and the highest vote for any constituency since the formation of the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh Western. It is frustrating that we werenât able to move the dial in other constituencies and on the regional lists."" Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent The SNPâs victory in these elections means the party is
heading for at least 19 years in power. Thatâs remarkable. Some will be slightly disappointed at not achieving a
majority. But the fact there is a comfortable pro-independence majority means
the issue is going to continue to be a significant one in Scottish and UK politics for years. In Downing Street, the plan was always to say no to
indyref2. That hasnât changed today, meaning a big political and potentially
legal battle is coming. But maybe not immediately. Nicola Sturgeon has said her
immediate focus will be the pandemic. Thatâs one way in which the Scottish and
UK governments agree. Kirsten CampbellBBC Scotland political correspondent The sixth session of the Scottish Parliament is going to be
the most diverse yet. There will be more women than have ever been elected before, more
disabled MSPs and more politicians from minority ethnic backgrounds. A total of 58 female candidates have been successful. The previous high was 48, back in 1999. The SNP actively chose to replace MSPs who were standing down with
female candidates where possible. Labour too sought to promote women by zipping candidates,
alternating men and women on their party list. Leader Anas Sarwar, who by
rights should have topped the Glasgow list, ceded the top spot to Pauline
McNeill to set an example. The challenge for Holyrood will be to
retain this new cohort. Politics is a notoriously un-family-friendly business.
Four female MSPs with young children decided to stand down this year to
find a better work-life balance. With all the results in, the SNP has won a fourth consecutive victory in the Scottish Parliament election. The party finished on 64 seats - one more than in 2016, but one short of an overall majority. The Conservatives won 31 seats, Labour 22, the Scottish Greens eight and Liberal Democrats four. You can check outall the results here. Professor Sir John CurticePolling expert The final share of the vote for the pro-independence parties combined on the two ballots is as follows:  This leaves plenty of room for argument as to whether or not this election did register majority support for the idea of holding another referendum on independence. Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor For a minority SNP administration, Greens are vital to Holyrood voting
through an independence referendum. There is much that the two sides can
agree on, including action on climate change. The
Greens could hope to force a faster pace of reduction
in emissions, pushing for more spend on public transport, less on roads, and
improved energy efficiency in homes and public buildings. The tensions are more likely to be around
oil and gas. The SNP is signed up to a transition
from burning fossil fuels to renewable energy, but it is more cautious than the Greens about the speed of winding down the oil and gas sector. That has become politically
sensitive in the Holyrood election. Tactical voting has
underlined the battle between the SNP and Tories in north east Scotland, once the SNPâs heartland. Since last yearâs plummet in the oil price, the SNP cannot
be seen to be too negative about the offshore industry without having a strong
and credible message about the transition and securing jobs. The Greens could hope to make progress, as
they claim to have done in 2018, in shifting tax policy. Their
manifesto was in favour of a shift to taxing wealth. That would include reform of council tax and business
rates, to base tax on land and asset values. The SNP has wanted to replace
council tax as well, but has given up on proposing a clear alternative in the
hope of cross-party agreement. It would be wary of major reforms, for the risk of
political backlash from those who lose out. Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor Nicola Sturgeon will be looking for allies to support her minority government The election of another SNP minority government opens up
questions of where it would build a coalition or shifting alliances needed to secure
votes, legislation and budgets. Having
done so as a minority administration between 2007 and 2011, and again since 2016,
it has a lot of experience in making that happen. And
having built up a rapport in the most recent parliament with Scottish Greens,
on budgets as well as independence, that is the obvious place to look for the
big votes. Greens
point out the sessions when the SNP relied more on
Conservative MSPs to get its business through. A
coalition would likely involve a formal deal on legislation. Deals between Labour and Lib Dems in 1999 and 2003 were brokered by
civil servants and depended heavily on finding common ground in manifestos. The Lib Dems
secured a disproportionately large number
of ministerial jobs, and held a veto over Labour on unforeseen votes. With their experience of minority government, it seems unlikely the SNP would go for that arrangement unless forced. The Scottish Greens would also be wary, if they look at the Lib Dems' track record at Holyrood and Westminster. Junior partners in coalitions can be burned by the compromises required. The SNP could look for a ""confidence and supply"" arrangement, to secure budgets and when other opposition parties put down motions of no confidence. But Greens have also been learning lessons about how to make the most of their leverage, and any such deal could be hard won by the SNP. Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar says his party are ""on a journey"" and ""back on the pitch"" despite being projected to finish with two fewer seats (22) than they achieved in the 2016 election. Mr Sarwar, who has only been in the role for 10 weeks, told BBC Scotland that time was not on his side - but that ""even his harshest critics"" would say the party has ""come a long way in that time"".

Mr Sarwar also hailed the election of the first women of colour to Holyrood and the success of Labour's Pam Duncan-Glancy,  who will be the parliament's first permanent wheelchair user.

"Tel Aviv's beaches have been busy again as coronavirus restrictions have eased Prices for international travel are set to rise this year due to pent-up demand and fewer aeroplanes in service, a travel boss has warned. Booking.com's chief executive Glenn Fogel told the BBC that holiday ""prices are already going up"". Many airlines have significantly reduced the number of flights they operate due to travel restrictions. However, Tui's UK boss Andrew Flintham said it would be ""a long time"" before holiday firms try to boost profits. Mr Fogel said that despite huge demand, uncertainty makes it hard for airlines to plan bringing more planes back into service. ""There's so much pent-up demand,"" said Mr Fogel. ""Everybody wants to go travelling, but we all want to do it safely."" EU unveils plans for overseas tourists to return When can I holiday abroad and how will the green list work? Airlines' Covid travel pass ready 'within weeks' John Grant, an aviation analyst with global travel data provider OAG said this will have a knock-on impact on air fares as travel restrictions are eased. ""That will, in the short term, create a rush of pent-up demand and revenge spending,"" he said. ""In turn, the airline algorithms will detect an uptick in demand and move prices up accordingly"". Airlines have reduced capacity by putting aeroplanes into storage, such as these in France The government will shortly announce which foreign destinations holidaymakers from England can visit from 17 May without needing to quarantine on their return. Air fares to Portugal - which is expected to be on the green list - have already started to rise as airlines respond to higher demand. According to PA, British Airways is charging Â£530 for a flight from Heathrow to the Algarve on 17 May, compared with Â£276 two days earlier. A Ryanair flight from Stansted to Lisbon costs Â£262 on 19 May, PA found, more than double the price of Â£128 on 14 May. But Tui's managing director for the UK and Ireland, Andrew Flintham, told BBC Breakfast travel firms were unlikely to push up prices anytime soon. ""Our prices are very, very stable. They're pretty much like for like, flat, year over year. There isn't a big increase in there. ""We've got plenty of holidays to sell. I think everybody in the industry has. ""It'll be a long time before the idea of trying to increase prices to make more money. We want to get people away on holiday, having a great time, because we think they genuinely all deserve it."" A lack of clarity about how governments will go about recognising vaccine and testing statuses from other countries is troubling the travel industry, which has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic. Mr Fogel believes a single system would be helpful: ""So many different people in so many different governments are talking about different programmes, but right now, there is nothing out there that is unified, so it's very confusing. ""I listened to the prime minister of Italy saying how they want to let people into Italy soon and you just have to prove that you have a vaccine and it'd be great. ""And my thinking is, well, I have my vaccine myself, but how do I prove it? Do I just bring my little white card that I got in the US that said I got it, is that going to be good enough? We need some clarifications."" Several systems are being explored, including the International Air Transport Association (IATA)'s travel pass, which is being trialled by a number of airlines. Meanwhile, theEuropean Union is working on having a digital passready in time for the summer holidays. The idea of a scheme that allows passengers who have had the vaccine to travel has proved divisive. The UK equality watchdog recently warned it could create a ""two-tier society, whereby only certain groups are able to fully enjoy their rights"". That's a view supported by the World Health Organization (WHO) but Mr Fogel disagrees. ""It's true that if you're not vaccinated, you may not be able to enter a country under this type of a system,"" he said. ""But I'm okay with that. Because the alternative is what - nobody gets to go in? That doesn't make a lot of sense to me."" He added that there are countries that people cannot go into if they don't have proof of vaccination against yellow fever, for example. ""There's nothing wrong with using technology to prove you are a safe traveller that can help get the industry up faster,"" said Mr Fogel. How to verify the coronavirus vaccine and test status of travellers like this man at Milan's Malpensa Airport has become a divisive issue The lack of clarity has hurt the finances of Booking.com's US owner Booking Holdings, which also owns Kayak and rentalcars.com. Revenues for the three months to the end of March fell to $1.1bn (Â£790m) - 50% lower than the same period a year ago. Figures from the World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC) reflect a similar picture across the industry, showing tourism's value to the global economy fell from nearly $9.2tn in 2019 to $4.7tn in 2020. As a share of the global economy that equates to a fall from 10.4% to just 5.5%. But Mr Fogel, who is chief executive of both the Dutch-based Booking.com and its parent firm Booking Holdings, told investors that there is still reason to be optimistic things will improve. ""While the pace of vaccine distribution remains frustratingly slow in most places around the world, Israel, the UK and the US are benefiting from successful vaccine distribution programs,"" he said. ""In each of these countries, we have seen encouraging booking trends, which supports our view that vaccine distribution is key to unlocking pent-up travel demand.""

"The Array Collective at Pride 2019 (left) and Project Art Works' Siddharth Gadiyar at the Phoenix Art Space The 2021 Turner Prize nominees are, for the first time, made up of collectives who have helped to ""inspire social change through art"", organisers say. Exhibitions have been largely closed over the past year due to the pandemic. With that in mind, Friday's shortlist contained the names of five groups who continued to work in the community. Prize chair and Tate Britain director Alex Farquharson said it is intended to capture and reflect the mood of the moment in contemporary British art. ""After a year of lockdowns when very few artists have been able to exhibit publicly, the jury has selected five outstanding collectives whose work has not only continued through the pandemic but become even more relevant as a result,"" he said in a statement. The efforts - by Array Collective, Black Obsidian Sound System (B.O.S.S.), Cooking Sections, Gentle/Radical and Project Arts Works - have included artwork in support of law changes in Northern Ireland, a 24-hour fundraising rave for queer, trans and intersex black and people of colour, and the use of food to help understand the workings of the world. As well as a lockdown doorstep neighbourhood story-telling campaign and work by a group of neurodiverse artists. Last year's Turner Prize didn't happen at all due to the effects of coronavirus and it was instead replaced by a fund for struggling artists. In 2019,the prize pot was split four waysat the nominees' request. Eventual joint-winners Lawrence Abu Hamdan, Helen Cammock, Tai Shani and Oscar Murillo said they wanted to make a ""collective statement"" at a time when there was ""already so much that divides and isolates people and communities"" - a nod to the fall-out from the Brexit referendum. This year is the first time a Turner Prize jury has selected a shortlist comprising entirely of artist collectives, who the judges say have all showed ""solidarity"" with various communities across the UK during a difficult 12 months. Array Collective on International Women's Day in 2019 Array Collectiveare a group of Belfast-based artists whose work tackles issues affecting Northern Ireland. Their work encompasses performances, protests, exhibitions and events. The jury commended the way it ""fuses seriousness with humour, and addresses contemporary issues using ancient folk imagery"". Recent projects have included public artworks in support of the decriminalisation of abortion in Northern Ireland, challenging legislative discrimination of the queer community, and participation in the group exhibition Jerwood Collaborate! in London. A portrait of B.O.S.S. artists The English capital is whereBlack Obsidian Sound System (B.O.S.S.)are based, and they work across art, sound and radical activism. Formed by and for QTIBPOC (queer, trans and intersex black and people of colour), the group aims to challenge the perceived norms of sound-system culture across African communities In London - through club nights, art installations, technical workshops and a film documenting QTIBPOC nightlife. Judges praised their live performances - they've put on events at Somerset House - and ""their commitment to community"", including an online 24-hour fundraising rave. A portrait of the Cooking Sections artists Cooking Sectionsare the other London-based nominees and they examine the systems that organise the world through food. Using installation, performance and video, they explore the overlapping boundaries between art, architecture, ecology and geopolitics. Turner Prize officials applauded the ingenuity of their long-term CLIMAVORE project, which asks questions about how our diet can respond to the climate emergency. The duo put on a sound, light and sculpture installation at Tate Britain last year, reflecting on salmon farming, as well as an ongoing installation-performance on the Isle of Skye which sees an underwater oyster table turn into a community dining space at low tide. Gentle/Radical's Doorstep Revolution Over in the Cardiff,Gentle/Radical- made up of artists, community workers, performers, faith practitioners, writers and others - are advocating for art as a tool for social change. They create real and virtual spaces for communities in Wales to engage with culture, such as the creation a pop-up cinema space showing independent films. Their ongoing Doorstep Revolution helped people to share neighbourhood stories during lockdown. The jury admired their ""deep commitment"" to the hyper-local community of their native Riverside. Illuminating the Wilderness found Project Art Works on location in Glen Affric, Scotland Last but not least,Project Art Worksare a collective of neurodiverse artists and makers based in Hastings. Neurodiversity is defined as autistic or other neurologically atypical patterns of thought or behaviour. They explore art through collaborative practice with, for and by neurominorities - and their work appears in exhibitions, events, films and online. Their recent film, Illuminating the Wilderness, followed members of the collective and their families and carers exploring a remote Scottish glen. The jury praised their continuing work at Hastings Contemporary, where passers-by could continue to view work in lockdown by looking through the windows of the closed gallery. An exhibition of all five Turner Prize nominees work will be held at the Herbert Art Gallery and Museum in Coventry from 29 September until 12 January 2022, as part of the UK City of Culture 2021 celebrations.

"Twitter has suspended an account sharing posts from former US president Donald Trump's new communications platform. The account claimed to be tweeting ""on behalf"" of Mr Trump. A spokesperson for the company said the account, @DJTDesk, violated theban evasion policy,externalby sharing content ""affiliated with a suspended account."" But the BBC found similar accounts still active on the social media platform. Mr Trump was permanently banned from Twitter in January after he voiced support for rioters who stormed the US Capitol. He launched his own communications platform - titled ""From the Desk of Donald J Trump,external"" - on Tuesday. The account was suspended hours after appearing on Twitter. According toNBC News,external, the bio for the @DJTDesk account read: ""Posts copied from Save America on behalf of the 45th POTUS; Originally composed via DonaldJTrump/Desk"". Twitter says that although it does allow accounts to share content from Mr Trump's new website, it won't allow an individual to ""circumvent"" a ban. Those ""evasion"" rules can include ""having someone else operate on your behalf, an account which represents your identity, persona, brand or business persona for a different purpose.""

"This video can not be played Mark Drakeford is set to remain as first minister of Wales as his party wins 30 seats in the Senedd Labour is set to stay in power in Wales after matching its best-ever Senedd election result, with exactly half of the 60 seats in the Welsh Parliament. The Tories took the Vale of Clwyd from Labour, and Brecon and Radnorshire from the Liberal Democrats. Labour held firm in other Tory target seats and took Rhondda back from Plaid Cymru. Leader Mark Drakeford, who extended the majority in his seat, vowed to form a ""stable and progressive"" government. With 52 of the 60 seats declared, Labour is on 30 with the Conservatives on 12, Plaid Cymru nine and the Liberal Democrats one. As it happened: Welsh election results day The Welsh election story - in charts It is unlikely Labour will gain further seats when votes for the regional lists in South Wales Central and South Wales East are counted on Saturday, after the party won the lion's share of constituency seats there. Current first minister Mr Drakeford,who raised his majority in his Cardiff West seat by 12.7 points and more than 6,000 votes, told BBC Wales he would ""do whatever I can"" to ensure Wales has a ""stable and progressive"" government. He added he would prefer to be in a position ""where you have a government that is able to command a majority for the action that it needs to take on the floor of the Senedd"". He added: ""Without trying to rush a decision at this time on a Friday we'll take a couple of days to make sure that we make the best decision that we can for Wales."" Allow Twitter content?

Labour also regained Rhondda from Plaid Cymru, toppling its former leader Leanne Wood. Her win there in 2016 was one of the major upsets of the last Senedd election but Labour's Buffy Williams overturned it with a 19% swing and a majority of more than 5,000. Ben Lake, the Plaid Cymru MP for Ceredigion, said losing the Rhondda seat was a ""terrible blow for the party"". Asked if the party could still play a role in a coalition with Labour if required, he said it was a ""dead duck"". ""The people of Wales have sent a very clear message at the election, and I can't see it being feasible or indeed desirable on the part of either party,"" he toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfast. Plaid Cymru has won five constituency seats, holding on to Arfon, Dwyfor Meirionnydd, Ynys Mon, Ceredigion, and Carmarthen East and Dinefwr. With three of the five regional list results declared so far, Plaid has won four list seats, the Conservatives four, Labour three and the Liberal Democrats one. The Conservatives held on to Montgomeryshire, Aberconwy, Clwyd West, Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire, and Preseli Pembrokeshire. The party also kept Monmouth where ex-Monmouthshire council leader Peter Fox is its new incumbent following the deselection of Nick Ramsay. But the Tories failed to capture the Vale of Glamorgan, another Labour-held target seat which is Conservative at Westminster.

The Labour seats of Alyn and Deeside, Gower, Swansea East, Swansea West, Neath, Aberavon, Ogmore, Bridgend, Cynon Valley, Pontypridd, Cardiff Central, Cardiff North, Cardiff South and Penarth, Cardiff West, Caerphilly, Islwyn, Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney, Newport East, Newport West and Torfaen have also remained red. Labour also held on to the Plaid Cymru target seat of Llanelli, with Welsh government deputy transport minister Lee Waters being re-elected. Following his victory, Mr Waters said Mark Drakeford was ""definitely an asset"", due to his leadership during the pandemic. ""He may not be flashy, he may be a bit nerdy, a bit boring, he's a university professor, but thank God for him,"" he said. Health Minister Vaughan Gething also paid tribute to his party leader, saying: ""The recognition of the way Mark has run the Welsh government in this extraordinary time was undoubtedly a factor in the way that people have voted."" How to organise an election in a pandemic A really simple guide to the Welsh elections Five things to find out from the Welsh election Despite the challenges of the pandemic, more than 1.1 million people voted, making it the highest-ever turnout for a Senedd election at 46.6%. This beat the previous record of 46.3% at the first Senedd election in 1999, but is still significantly lower than turnout for general elections. Laura McAllister, professor of public policy at Cardiff University, said Labour had ""performed better than most people expected"". ""After 22 years in power, with a Conservative Party that was really strongly tipped to make significant breakthroughs, and of course Plaid Cymru biting its ankles as well, that's some achievement."" Political commentator Prof Roger Awan-Scully said: ""I think it's been an astonishingly resilient performance by the Welsh Labour Party, amidst disasters for Labour elsewhere in the UK. ""The Conservatives are also performing strongly, but not quite bringing it home in terms of the number of constituency victories that they might have expected. ""For Plaid Cymru I think this has to be said to be a deeply disappointing election."" Gareth Davies thanked voters for their trust in him The Vale of Clwyd was the only Conservative gain in Labour's ""red wall"" of seats in north Wales where the Tories had enjoyed success in the 2019 General Election. Winning candidate Gareth Davies, an NHS physiotherapist, said: ""It's a magnificent achievement. ""In 1999 I was a small boy, and now I'm in my 30s and I never thought back then I'd ever be in this position. So I feel really humbled."" Andrew RT Davies, leader of the Tories in the Senedd, said the result in the Vale of Clwyd was ""fantastic"". North Wales has been a fiercely contested battleground, with re-elected Aberconwy Tory MS Janet Finch-Saunders sayingshe had been ""horrified""by personal attacks which had hurt her family during the campaign. Labour's win in Alyn and Deeside represents the last of the red wall seats that the Conservatives had hoped to take in north east Wales. It's the last brick in the wall. But they have only managed in this election to take Vale of Clwyd in that region - by a small amount. So it counts as a disappointing set of results for the Conservatives. Labour, which has been in charge of the Welsh government for 22 years, is now set to remain in power for a sixth term with exactly half the seats in the Senedd chamber. Of the 60 members of the Senedd (MSs) being elected, 40 will serve constituencies and 20 will be elected to represent larger regional areas of North Wales, Mid and West Wales, South Wales West, South Wales Central and South Wales East. A party needs to win 31 seats to claim a majority but it has never happened, with Labour last time having 29 seats. It previously won 30 seats in 2003 and 2011. Social distancing and other Covid measures have delayed the count in many areas For Plaid Cymru, the party's Westminster leader Liz Saville Roberts painted a gloomy picture for their hopes of making inroads into Labour's grip on the south Wales valleys. She said the pandemic had meant ""ministers in the governments, both in Westminster and Cardiff, have had an immense platform over the last year"". It had been an ""extraordinarily different"" election, Ms Saville Roberts said, ""to anything that anybody has been used to, and it's been difficult for a party like Plaid to get the same sort of platform"". ""At the same time there's a real sense that our policy, our offer of policies, has offered something that was progressive and new and is, I hope, really the seeds for something in the future,"" she added. Adam Price, who held Carmarthen East and Dinefwr with a reduced majority, said he would not stand down as Plaid Cymru leader. Adam Price was re-elected in Carmarthen East and Dinefwr but saw his majority fall Despite no gains, Mr Price said the party had increased its share of the vote and its stance on independence had been a ""net positive"". ""I'm not walking away from anything, because this is the moment when Wales needs leadership,"" he said. ""This is a historic challenge, because of the way that the politics is moving in this island, but it's also a historic opportunity for us. ""We can move our nation forward and I'm looking forward to playing my part, it's not something that anyone can do on their own. ""I have a role to play, we all have a role to play and that's what's exciting about politics at the moment. Wales is on the move Wales is on the march. I'm going to be part of that.""

Liberal Democrat peer Baroness Jenny Randerson said she did not think Welsh Labour would need the support of Ms Dodds to run a government as had happened with her predecessor, former Education Minister Kirsty Williams who stood down prior to the elections. ""I think Labour will have the numbers to just about manage on their own,"" said Baroness Randerson. Ian Price, director of CBI Wales, congratulated Labour. ""This is a critical time for the Welsh economy and the new parliament must have a laser-like focus on rebuilding from the devastating impact of the pandemic,"" he said. ""That means all parties pulling together and working with business to protect jobs, rebuild livelihoods and create a fair and sustainable recovery that addresses the longstanding structural challenges our economy faces."" The Abolish the Welsh Assembly Party was also hoping to make a breakthrough in the regional lists.

"Tel Aviv's beaches have been busy again as coronavirus restrictions have eased Prices for international travel are set to rise this year due to pent-up demand and fewer aeroplanes in service, a travel boss has warned. Booking.com's chief executive Glenn Fogel told the BBC that holiday ""prices are already going up"". Many airlines have significantly reduced the number of flights they operate due to travel restrictions. However, Tui's UK boss Andrew Flintham said it would be ""a long time"" before holiday firms try to boost profits. Mr Fogel said that despite huge demand, uncertainty makes it hard for airlines to plan bringing more planes back into service. ""There's so much pent-up demand,"" said Mr Fogel. ""Everybody wants to go travelling, but we all want to do it safely."" EU unveils plans for overseas tourists to return When can I holiday abroad and how will the green list work? Airlines' Covid travel pass ready 'within weeks' John Grant, an aviation analyst with global travel data provider OAG said this will have a knock-on impact on air fares as travel restrictions are eased. ""That will, in the short term, create a rush of pent-up demand and revenge spending,"" he said. ""In turn, the airline algorithms will detect an uptick in demand and move prices up accordingly"". Airlines have reduced capacity by putting aeroplanes into storage, such as these in France The government will shortly announce which foreign destinations holidaymakers from England can visit from 17 May without needing to quarantine on their return. Air fares to Portugal - which is expected to be on the green list - have already started to rise as airlines respond to higher demand. According to PA, British Airways is charging Â£530 for a flight from Heathrow to the Algarve on 17 May, compared with Â£276 two days earlier. A Ryanair flight from Stansted to Lisbon costs Â£262 on 19 May, PA found, more than double the price of Â£128 on 14 May. But Tui's managing director for the UK and Ireland, Andrew Flintham, told BBC Breakfast travel firms were unlikely to push up prices anytime soon. ""Our prices are very, very stable. They're pretty much like for like, flat, year over year. There isn't a big increase in there. ""We've got plenty of holidays to sell. I think everybody in the industry has. ""It'll be a long time before the idea of trying to increase prices to make more money. We want to get people away on holiday, having a great time, because we think they genuinely all deserve it."" A lack of clarity about how governments will go about recognising vaccine and testing statuses from other countries is troubling the travel industry, which has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic. Mr Fogel believes a single system would be helpful: ""So many different people in so many different governments are talking about different programmes, but right now, there is nothing out there that is unified, so it's very confusing. ""I listened to the prime minister of Italy saying how they want to let people into Italy soon and you just have to prove that you have a vaccine and it'd be great. ""And my thinking is, well, I have my vaccine myself, but how do I prove it? Do I just bring my little white card that I got in the US that said I got it, is that going to be good enough? We need some clarifications."" Several systems are being explored, including the International Air Transport Association (IATA)'s travel pass, which is being trialled by a number of airlines. Meanwhile, theEuropean Union is working on having a digital passready in time for the summer holidays. The idea of a scheme that allows passengers who have had the vaccine to travel has proved divisive. The UK equality watchdog recently warned it could create a ""two-tier society, whereby only certain groups are able to fully enjoy their rights"". That's a view supported by the World Health Organization (WHO) but Mr Fogel disagrees. ""It's true that if you're not vaccinated, you may not be able to enter a country under this type of a system,"" he said. ""But I'm okay with that. Because the alternative is what - nobody gets to go in? That doesn't make a lot of sense to me."" He added that there are countries that people cannot go into if they don't have proof of vaccination against yellow fever, for example. ""There's nothing wrong with using technology to prove you are a safe traveller that can help get the industry up faster,"" said Mr Fogel. How to verify the coronavirus vaccine and test status of travellers like this man at Milan's Malpensa Airport has become a divisive issue The lack of clarity has hurt the finances of Booking.com's US owner Booking Holdings, which also owns Kayak and rentalcars.com. Revenues for the three months to the end of March fell to $1.1bn (Â£790m) - 50% lower than the same period a year ago. Figures from the World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC) reflect a similar picture across the industry, showing tourism's value to the global economy fell from nearly $9.2tn in 2019 to $4.7tn in 2020. As a share of the global economy that equates to a fall from 10.4% to just 5.5%. But Mr Fogel, who is chief executive of both the Dutch-based Booking.com and its parent firm Booking Holdings, told investors that there is still reason to be optimistic things will improve. ""While the pace of vaccine distribution remains frustratingly slow in most places around the world, Israel, the UK and the US are benefiting from successful vaccine distribution programs,"" he said. ""In each of these countries, we have seen encouraging booking trends, which supports our view that vaccine distribution is key to unlocking pent-up travel demand.""

"As always, one of the biggest counts will be at the Emirates Arena in Glasgow - but it will be staggered over two days Scots have cast their ballots in the Holyrood election, but don't need to stay up all night as Covid-19 restrictions have put paid to the usual overnight count. With votes to be tallied across Friday and Saturday, when will you know theresult in your local area- and when will the overall winners be declared? Counting will kick off from 09:00 on Friday morning, with the Electoral Management Board projecting 48 of the 73 constituencies to be tallied that day. The full lists can be foundhere, or you can look up your local results here: A modern browser with JavaScript and a stable internet connection is required to view this interactive.More information about these elections Enter your postcode, or the name of your English council or Scottish or Welsh constituency to find out. Eg 'W1A 1AA' or 'Westminster'   Friday's constituencies include both the most marginal and safest seats from 2016, and eight of the SNP's top 10 target seats. These include the Labour defences ofDumbarton, Edinburgh SouthernandEast Lothian, none of which have a majority exceeding 3%, and the Conservative seats inAyr, Edinburgh Central,DumfriesshireandEastwood. If the SNP manage to pick off the lion's share of these seats, they will feel good about going into Saturday and winning a majority. As always, one of the biggest counts will be at the Emirates Arena in Glasgow - but it will be staggered over two days This will particularly be the case if they can gain ground without suffering defeats in any of their own more marginal seats -Angus North & Mearns, MorayandPerthshire Northare those with single-digit majorities. The reverse is also true of course - if the SNP struggle to gain many of these marginal seats or lose some of their own, the path to a majority narrows. By the end of Friday, it should be fairly clear which way the wind is blowing - but there will still be plenty to play for on Saturday. If all goes well on Friday, the remaining 25 constituencies will count on Saturday - with the most marginal contests being between the SNP and Conservatives. The most marginal constituencies to count on Saturday are again SNP-Tory contests, with the SNP hoping to pick offAberdeenshire WestandGalloway&West Dumfries, both with majorities under 5%. It is not yet clear how Covid-safe protocols will affect the speed of counting There are a few chances for the Tories to fight back too, with the SNP defences ofPerthshire South& Kinross-shire,Edinburgh PentlandsandAberdeen SouthandNorth Kincardineall having single-digit majorities. Once each region has declared all of its constituencies, we will also start to get results from the regional lists - which could be pivotal for the overall result, as well as questions over who claims second place and the fate of smaller parties. Before we turn to the regional results, a quick note on how they are worked out. Scotland is divided into eight electoral regions, with the 73 constituency seats scattered across them. Each region elects an extra seven MSPs from lists submitted by the parties - voted for via the peach ballot paper - giving a total of 129. This video can not be played Election 2021: How does Scotland's voting system work? The idea of the list system is to make the outcome of the election more proportional. Once the constituency results have been declared, you divide the number of list votes each party has won by the number of seats they have already won in that region, plus one. So if a party has won nine seats in an area already, their list vote tally is divided by 10 - making it 10 times harder for them to win a seat from the lists. There has been particular focus on the list system in 2021 thanks to the emergence of some list-only parties which encourage tactical voting, leading to a debate over whether this is ""gaming the system"" or simply testing the limits of the rules. Timings for the counts remain very much up in the air, given we don't yet know how difficult it will prove to stack up ballots in line with Covid-19 restrictions. But under current plans, with the exception of the big centres of Glasgow and Edinburgh, most of the count centres only have one constituency to finish off on the Saturday. This means they could well finish up quickly - and indeed simultaneously, if there are similar numbers of ballots to count in each constituency. Which regions will declare first? It is hard to say, but theHighlands and Islands- normally one of the last regions to come back in an overnight count due to the vast and varied geography of the area - only has one seat to count on Saturday. Similarly there will only be one seat left to count from theWest Scotlandregion - so it is possible these two will be able to declare their full regional lists first. Other regions have at least a couple of constituencies still to polish off before they can run the equations and calculate list seats.Mid Scotland and Fifecould be next in line with three seats to count, all at separate locations. However, this is largely guesswork, and a lot will depend on how the Covid-safe procedures play out at count centres. There will be four constituencies counting at the Emirates Area in Glasgow on Saturday, and three at Ingliston for the Lothian region. South Scotlandalso has four counts still to run on Saturday, as doesNorth East Scotland- with two of the latter at P&J Live in Aberdeen, which may delay matters from a logistical standpoint.

"The SNP will form the next Holyrood government having won 64 seats - just one short of an overall majority Party leader and first minister Nicola Sturgeon says she wants to see the country through the pandemic and then ""give people in Scotland the right to choose their future"" With all results declared, the Scottish Conservatives have secured 31 seats (no change); Scottish Labour 22 (-2); Scottish Greens 8 (+2) and Scottish Lib Dems 4 (-1) Smaller parties, including former Scottish first minister Alex Salmond's Alba and George Galloway's All for Unity, won nothing The turnout of 66% is the highest since the parliament was established in 1999 BBC Scotland News The final results are in after a second day of counting in the Scottish Parliament election. Here are the key points: Glenn CampbellBBC Scotland Political Editor Having secured a fourth term in power for the SNP, Nicola
Sturgeon is not short of things to do as first minister. She has to form a government - that could be another
SNP-only administration, unless she wants to explore a more formal arrangement
with the independence-supporting Greens to secure an outright majority. She has to reshuffle her ministers, with four cabinet
posts - including that of health secretary - needing filled as a result of
retirements. There are also important decisions that need to be taken
on coronavirus - with a further easing of restrictions due on 17 May, plans
to reopen international travel to consider and concern over Covid cases in
Moray to address. Ms Sturgeon has insisted that dealing with the pandemic
and its aftermath will be her immediate priority - although clearly she intends
to press the case for another independence referendum too. There are also formalities - being sworn in with the
other 128 MSPs on Thursday, before putting herself forward in parliament for
re-election as first minister the following week. SNP deputy leader Keith Brown:""It is a fantastic win for the SNP. We have won this election out the park and in the process secured a historic fourth term.  We have got perhaps the most exciting manifesto I have ever seen in the SNP, and we are looking forward to implementing those policies."" Scottish Conservative MSP Craig Hoy:""This is a very good result for the Scottish Conservatives. We asked the pro-UK majority to come behind us and stop the SNP getting a majority, and we have done that. They thought they would walk into it and we have deprived them of that."" Labour MP Ian Murray:""We came into this campaign looking to stop the rot. Anas Sarwar has led from the front and he has won this election in terms of the party leaders and has put Scottish Labour back on the park. We are optimistic and looking forward to the future now."" Scottish Greens co-leader Lorna Slater:âWith this record result, the Scottish Greens have grown
our votes and influence in Scotland at this election. Thatâs because while
other parties focused on short-term tactical voting, the Scottish Greens
conducted a positive campaign on a green recovery and tackling the climate
crisis."" Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie:""We have had some astonishing constituency results, with almost half the vote in Shetland, more in Orkney and North East Fife and the highest vote for any constituency since the formation of the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh Western. It is frustrating that we werenât able to move the dial in other constituencies and on the regional lists."" Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent The SNPâs victory in these elections means the party is
heading for at least 19 years in power. Thatâs remarkable. Some will be slightly disappointed at not achieving a
majority. But the fact there is a comfortable pro-independence majority means
the issue is going to continue to be a significant one in Scottish and UK politics for years. In Downing Street, the plan was always to say no to
indyref2. That hasnât changed today, meaning a big political and potentially
legal battle is coming. But maybe not immediately. Nicola Sturgeon has said her
immediate focus will be the pandemic. Thatâs one way in which the Scottish and
UK governments agree. Kirsten CampbellBBC Scotland political correspondent The sixth session of the Scottish Parliament is going to be
the most diverse yet. There will be more women than have ever been elected before, more
disabled MSPs and more politicians from minority ethnic backgrounds. A total of 58 female candidates have been successful. The previous high was 48, back in 1999. The SNP actively chose to replace MSPs who were standing down with
female candidates where possible. Labour too sought to promote women by zipping candidates,
alternating men and women on their party list. Leader Anas Sarwar, who by
rights should have topped the Glasgow list, ceded the top spot to Pauline
McNeill to set an example. The challenge for Holyrood will be to
retain this new cohort. Politics is a notoriously un-family-friendly business.
Four female MSPs with young children decided to stand down this year to
find a better work-life balance. With all the results in, the SNP has won a fourth consecutive victory in the Scottish Parliament election. The party finished on 64 seats - one more than in 2016, but one short of an overall majority. The Conservatives won 31 seats, Labour 22, the Scottish Greens eight and Liberal Democrats four. You can check outall the results here. Professor Sir John CurticePolling expert The final share of the vote for the pro-independence parties combined on the two ballots is as follows:  This leaves plenty of room for argument as to whether or not this election did register majority support for the idea of holding another referendum on independence. Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor For a minority SNP administration, Greens are vital to Holyrood voting
through an independence referendum. There is much that the two sides can
agree on, including action on climate change. The
Greens could hope to force a faster pace of reduction
in emissions, pushing for more spend on public transport, less on roads, and
improved energy efficiency in homes and public buildings. The tensions are more likely to be around
oil and gas. The SNP is signed up to a transition
from burning fossil fuels to renewable energy, but it is more cautious than the Greens about the speed of winding down the oil and gas sector. That has become politically
sensitive in the Holyrood election. Tactical voting has
underlined the battle between the SNP and Tories in north east Scotland, once the SNPâs heartland. Since last yearâs plummet in the oil price, the SNP cannot
be seen to be too negative about the offshore industry without having a strong
and credible message about the transition and securing jobs. The Greens could hope to make progress, as
they claim to have done in 2018, in shifting tax policy. Their
manifesto was in favour of a shift to taxing wealth. That would include reform of council tax and business
rates, to base tax on land and asset values. The SNP has wanted to replace
council tax as well, but has given up on proposing a clear alternative in the
hope of cross-party agreement. It would be wary of major reforms, for the risk of
political backlash from those who lose out. Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor Nicola Sturgeon will be looking for allies to support her minority government The election of another SNP minority government opens up
questions of where it would build a coalition or shifting alliances needed to secure
votes, legislation and budgets. Having
done so as a minority administration between 2007 and 2011, and again since 2016,
it has a lot of experience in making that happen. And
having built up a rapport in the most recent parliament with Scottish Greens,
on budgets as well as independence, that is the obvious place to look for the
big votes. Greens
point out the sessions when the SNP relied more on
Conservative MSPs to get its business through. A
coalition would likely involve a formal deal on legislation. Deals between Labour and Lib Dems in 1999 and 2003 were brokered by
civil servants and depended heavily on finding common ground in manifestos. The Lib Dems
secured a disproportionately large number
of ministerial jobs, and held a veto over Labour on unforeseen votes. With their experience of minority government, it seems unlikely the SNP would go for that arrangement unless forced. The Scottish Greens would also be wary, if they look at the Lib Dems' track record at Holyrood and Westminster. Junior partners in coalitions can be burned by the compromises required. The SNP could look for a ""confidence and supply"" arrangement, to secure budgets and when other opposition parties put down motions of no confidence. But Greens have also been learning lessons about how to make the most of their leverage, and any such deal could be hard won by the SNP. Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar says his party are ""on a journey"" and ""back on the pitch"" despite being projected to finish with two fewer seats (22) than they achieved in the 2016 election. Mr Sarwar, who has only been in the role for 10 weeks, told BBC Scotland that time was not on his side - but that ""even his harshest critics"" would say the party has ""come a long way in that time"". ""I am happy compared to where we were 10 weeks ago, but am I satisfied in terms of where I want us to get to? Of course not,"" he said. ""We are on a journey and I recognise that.â Mr Sarwar, who returns to Holyrood on the Glasgow regional list, maintains Scottish Labour ""have a credibility again"" after a ""positive and energetic campaign"". ""We are back on the pitch and people arenât embarrassed anymore to say they vote Labour,"" he added. He also pledged to work with other parties to prioritise the country's recovery from the Covid crisis. Mr Sarwar also hailed the election of the first women of colour to Holyrood and the success of Labour's Pam Duncan-Glancy,  who will be the parliament's first permanent wheelchair user. The SNP won six of the nine constituency seats in the
Lothian region, meaning they did not pick up any additional members on the
regional list despite getting the most votes. The Conservatives got three seats on the list:  Labour won two:  Scottish Greens won two:  Full results here People have two votes in Scottish Parliament elections - one for a constituency MSP, and another for a regional ballot. There are 73 constituency MSPs, each elected on a first-past-the-post system similar to the UK general election - the winner is the candidate who receives the most votes in each constituency. In the regional ballot, people vote for a party. The parties are then allocated a number of MSPs depending on how many votes they receive - once the number of constituencies already won in that region is taken into account - to make the overall result more proportional. There are eight electoral regions, each with seven regional MSPs. These are:  This means that people in Scotland are each represented by eight MSPs - one representing their constituency and the other seven representing their region. The Scottish government is formed from the party that hold the most seats in the parliament, or alternatively a coalition of more than one party. It is led by the first minister, who appoints a number of ministers to be in charge of departments such as education, health and finance. Professor Sir John CurticePolling expert The South of Scotland result has now been officially declared. The SNP have managed to grab the last of the list seats in this region, so the party has managed to win 64 seats rather than 63. The SNP gained two extra constituency seats in the South Scotland
region â East Lothian and Ayr. Their success in the constituency â taking six of the nine
seats in the region â means they drop down from three regional list seats to just
one. The Conservatives, who lost the constituency seat of Ayr, picked up an extra regional list seat after a strong showing on the additional
member list. The seats in South of Scotland were: Conservative won three (up one):  Labour won three (up one):  SNP won one (down two) Professor Sir John CurticePolling expert In the aftermath of the Scottish Parliament election, there will doubtless be attempts by both sides of the constitutional debate to claim that their side of the argument is the more popular. However, it looks as though this is not a debate that either side can win. Given the results that are in so far, it looks as though the SNP plus the Greens are heading for 49% of the constituency vote, and that the SNP plus the Greens and Alba may win 51% of the list vote. In truth, the only safe conclusion one can draw from these results is that Scotland is indeed divided down the middle on the constitutional question. Alex Salmond has failed in his bid to return to the Scottish Parliament, as his Alba party missed out on a seat in the North East regional list Alba polled 8,269 votes in the region, 2.3% of the vote - well short of the number required to get an MSP. The former first minister and SNP leader had earlier conceded that his new party was unlikely to return any parliamentarians to Holyrood Mr Salmond says he will continue as party leader. In a statement he said the 32 Alba candidates had been ""injecting urgency"" into the need to deliver independence and that it intended to stay on the political scene. It plans to hold a conference in June and contest local elections in Scotland next year. The SNP won eight of the nine constituency seats in the Mid Scotland and Fife region, so did not get any MSPs under the additional member system. The Conservatives won four:  Labour won two:  Scottish Greens won one:  Full results here Professor Sir John CurticePolling expert With just one of the South Scotland constituencies to declare its list result, it looks as though it may be nip and tuck between Labour and the SNP for the last of the seven list seats. Labour might have a slightly better chance, but the SNP could yet edge it. If they were to do so then the party would end up on 64 seats rather than 63. In the North East, the list results were in line with predictions - four Conservatives, two Labour and one Green. BBC Radio Scotland Alistair Carmichael,
the Liberal Democratsâ MP for Orkney and Shetland since 2001, said the predicted outcome for Willie Rennie's Scottish party - which would see them drop from five seats to four in Holyrood - was a âdisappointing result, there
is no getting away from thatâ. Despite that, Mr Carmichael said there was nothing about the party's campaign ""for which we should be apologising or should be embarrassed"". He congratulated the SNP, and Nicola Sturgeon in particular, for âa quite
remarkable election outcomeâ. Ms Sturgeon was ""right"", he said, in saying she would prioritise
dealing with the pandemic first, but believed there were ""mixed messagesâ in
hercomments on an independence referendum, which âsuggested her mind might well be
elsewhereâ. As long as the first minister ""is prepared to
put the recovery first, then she will get a fair hearing from us,"" Mr Carmichael told BBC Radio Scotland. Pam Gosal Pam Gosal has become the second woman of colour to be elected to the Scottish Parliament. The Conservative candidate was elected as an MSP via the Glasgow list. Earlier this year, Ms Gosal said she had experienced racist abuse throughout her life but said it would never stop her.Read more here. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The SNP will form the next Holyrood government having won 64 seats - just one short of an overall majority Party leader and first minister Nicola Sturgeon says she wants to see the country through the pandemic and then ""give people in Scotland the right to choose their future"" With all results declared, the Scottish Conservatives have secured 31 seats (no change); Scottish Labour 22 (-2); Scottish Greens 8 (+2) and Scottish Lib Dems 4 (-1) Smaller parties, including former Scottish first minister Alex Salmond's Alba and George Galloway's All for Unity, won nothing The turnout of 66% is the highest since the parliament was established in 1999 BBC Scotland News The final results are in after a second day of counting in the Scottish Parliament election. Here are the key points: Glenn CampbellBBC Scotland Political Editor Having secured a fourth term in power for the SNP, Nicola
Sturgeon is not short of things to do as first minister. She has to form a government - that could be another
SNP-only administration, unless she wants to explore a more formal arrangement
with the independence-supporting Greens to secure an outright majority. She has to reshuffle her ministers, with four cabinet
posts - including that of health secretary - needing filled as a result of
retirements. There are also important decisions that need to be taken
on coronavirus - with a further easing of restrictions due on 17 May, plans
to reopen international travel to consider and concern over Covid cases in
Moray to address. Ms Sturgeon has insisted that dealing with the pandemic
and its aftermath will be her immediate priority - although clearly she intends
to press the case for another independence referendum too. There are also formalities - being sworn in with the
other 128 MSPs on Thursday, before putting herself forward in parliament for
re-election as first minister the following week. SNP deputy leader Keith Brown:""It is a fantastic win for the SNP. We have won this election out the park and in the process secured a historic fourth term.  We have got perhaps the most exciting manifesto I have ever seen in the SNP, and we are looking forward to implementing those policies."" Scottish Conservative MSP Craig Hoy:""This is a very good result for the Scottish Conservatives. We asked the pro-UK majority to come behind us and stop the SNP getting a majority, and we have done that. They thought they would walk into it and we have deprived them of that."" Labour MP Ian Murray:""We came into this campaign looking to stop the rot. Anas Sarwar has led from the front and he has won this election in terms of the party leaders and has put Scottish Labour back on the park. We are optimistic and looking forward to the future now."" Scottish Greens co-leader Lorna Slater:âWith this record result, the Scottish Greens have grown
our votes and influence in Scotland at this election. Thatâs because while
other parties focused on short-term tactical voting, the Scottish Greens
conducted a positive campaign on a green recovery and tackling the climate
crisis."" Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie:""We have had some astonishing constituency results, with almost half the vote in Shetland, more in Orkney and North East Fife and the highest vote for any constituency since the formation of the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh Western. It is frustrating that we werenât able to move the dial in other constituencies and on the regional lists.""

The SNP could look for a ""confidence and supply"" arrangement, to secure budgets and when other opposition parties put down motions of no confidence. But Greens have also been learning lessons about how to make the most of their leverage, and any such deal could be hard won by the SNP. Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar says his party are ""on a journey"" and ""back on the pitch"" despite being projected to finish with two fewer seats (22) than they achieved in the 2016 election. Mr Sarwar, who has only been in the role for 10 weeks, told BBC Scotland that time was not on his side - but that ""even his harshest critics"" would say the party has ""come a long way in that time"". ""I am happy compared to where we were 10 weeks ago, but am I satisfied in terms of where I want us to get to? Of course not,"" he said. ""We are on a journey and I recognise that.â Mr Sarwar, who returns to Holyrood on the Glasgow regional list, maintains Scottish Labour ""have a credibility again"" after a ""positive and energetic campaign"". ""We are back on the pitch and people arenât embarrassed anymore to say they vote Labour,"" he added. He also pledged to work with other parties to prioritise the country's recovery from the Covid crisis. Mr Sarwar also hailed the election of the first women of colour to Holyrood and the success of Labour's Pam Duncan-Glancy,  who will be the parliament's first permanent wheelchair user. The SNP won six of the nine constituency seats in the
Lothian region, meaning they did not pick up any additional members on the
regional list despite getting the most votes. The Conservatives got three seats on the list:  Labour won two:  Scottish Greens won two:  Full results here People have two votes in Scottish Parliament elections - one for a constituency MSP, and another for a regional ballot. There are 73 constituency MSPs, each elected on a first-past-the-post system similar to the UK general election - the winner is the candidate who receives the most votes in each constituency. In the regional ballot, people vote for a party. The parties are then allocated a number of MSPs depending on how many votes they receive - once the number of constituencies already won in that region is taken into account - to make the overall result more proportional. There are eight electoral regions, each with seven regional MSPs. These are:  This means that people in Scotland are each represented by eight MSPs - one representing their constituency and the other seven representing their region. The Scottish government is formed from the party that hold the most seats in the parliament, or alternatively a coalition of more than one party. It is led by the first minister, who appoints a number of ministers to be in charge of departments such as education, health and finance. Professor Sir John CurticePolling expert The South of Scotland result has now been officially declared. The SNP have managed to grab the last of the list seats in this region, so the party has managed to win 64 seats rather than 63. The SNP gained two extra constituency seats in the South Scotland
region â East Lothian and Ayr. Their success in the constituency â taking six of the nine
seats in the region â means they drop down from three regional list seats to just
one. The Conservatives, who lost the constituency seat of Ayr, picked up an extra regional list seat after a strong showing on the additional
member list. The seats in South of Scotland were: Conservative won three (up one):  Labour won three (up one):  SNP won one (down two) Professor Sir John CurticePolling expert In the aftermath of the Scottish Parliament election, there will doubtless be attempts by both sides of the constitutional debate to claim that their side of the argument is the more popular. However, it looks as though this is not a debate that either side can win. Given the results that are in so far, it looks as though the SNP plus the Greens are heading for 49% of the constituency vote, and that the SNP plus the Greens and Alba may win 51% of the list vote. In truth, the only safe conclusion one can draw from these results is that Scotland is indeed divided down the middle on the constitutional question. Alex Salmond has failed in his bid to return to the Scottish Parliament, as his Alba party missed out on a seat in the North East regional list Alba polled 8,269 votes in the region, 2.3% of the vote - well short of the number required to get an MSP. The former first minister and SNP leader had earlier conceded that his new party was unlikely to return any parliamentarians to Holyrood Mr Salmond says he will continue as party leader. In a statement he said the 32 Alba candidates had been ""injecting urgency"" into the need to deliver independence and that it intended to stay on the political scene. It plans to hold a conference in June and contest local elections in Scotland next year. The SNP won eight of the nine constituency seats in the Mid Scotland and Fife region, so did not get any MSPs under the additional member system. The Conservatives won four:  Labour won two:  Scottish Greens won one:  Full results here Professor Sir John CurticePolling expert With just one of the South Scotland constituencies to declare its list result, it looks as though it may be nip and tuck between Labour and the SNP for the last of the seven list seats. Labour might have a slightly better chance, but the SNP could yet edge it. If they were to do so then the party would end up on 64 seats rather than 63. In the North East, the list results were in line with predictions - four Conservatives, two Labour and one Green. BBC Radio Scotland Alistair Carmichael,
the Liberal Democratsâ MP for Orkney and Shetland since 2001, said the predicted outcome for Willie Rennie's Scottish party - which would see them drop from five seats to four in Holyrood - was a âdisappointing result, there
is no getting away from thatâ. Despite that, Mr Carmichael said there was nothing about the party's campaign ""for which we should be apologising or should be embarrassed"". He congratulated the SNP, and Nicola Sturgeon in particular, for âa quite
remarkable election outcomeâ. Ms Sturgeon was ""right"", he said, in saying she would prioritise
dealing with the pandemic first, but believed there were ""mixed messagesâ in
hercomments on an independence referendum, which âsuggested her mind might well be
elsewhereâ. As long as the first minister ""is prepared to
put the recovery first, then she will get a fair hearing from us,"" Mr Carmichael told BBC Radio Scotland. Pam Gosal Pam Gosal has become the second woman of colour to be elected to the Scottish Parliament. The Conservative candidate was elected as an MSP via the Glasgow list. Earlier this year, Ms Gosal said she had experienced racist abuse throughout her life but said it would never stop her.Read more here. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Mark Drakeford is set to remain as first minister of Wales as his party wins 30 seats in the Senedd Labour is set to stay in power in Wales after matching its best-ever Senedd election result, with exactly half of the 60 seats in the Welsh Parliament. The Tories took the Vale of Clwyd from Labour, and Brecon and Radnorshire from the Liberal Democrats. Labour held firm in other Tory target seats and took Rhondda back from Plaid Cymru. Leader Mark Drakeford, who extended the majority in his seat, vowed to form a ""stable and progressive"" government. With 52 of the 60 seats declared, Labour is on 30 with the Conservatives on 12, Plaid Cymru nine and the Liberal Democrats one. As it happened: Welsh election results day The Welsh election story - in charts It is unlikely Labour will gain further seats when votes for the regional lists in South Wales Central and South Wales East are counted on Saturday, after the party won the lion's share of constituency seats there. Current first minister Mr Drakeford,who raised his majority in his Cardiff West seat by 12.7 points and more than 6,000 votes, told BBC Wales he would ""do whatever I can"" to ensure Wales has a ""stable and progressive"" government. He added he would prefer to be in a position ""where you have a government that is able to command a majority for the action that it needs to take on the floor of the Senedd"". He added: ""Without trying to rush a decision at this time on a Friday we'll take a couple of days to make sure that we make the best decision that we can for Wales."" Allow Twitter content?

Labour also regained Rhondda from Plaid Cymru, toppling its former leader Leanne Wood. Her win there in 2016 was one of the major upsets of the last Senedd election but Labour's Buffy Williams overturned it with a 19% swing and a majority of more than 5,000. Ben Lake, the Plaid Cymru MP for Ceredigion, said losing the Rhondda seat was a ""terrible blow for the party"". Asked if the party could still play a role in a coalition with Labour if required, he said it was a ""dead duck"". ""The people of Wales have sent a very clear message at the election, and I can't see it being feasible or indeed desirable on the part of either party,"" he toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfast. Plaid Cymru has won five constituency seats, holding on to Arfon, Dwyfor Meirionnydd, Ynys Mon, Ceredigion, and Carmarthen East and Dinefwr. With three of the five regional list results declared so far, Plaid has won four list seats, the Conservatives four, Labour three and the Liberal Democrats one. The Conservatives held on to Montgomeryshire, Aberconwy, Clwyd West, Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire, and Preseli Pembrokeshire. The party also kept Monmouth where ex-Monmouthshire council leader Peter Fox is its new incumbent following the deselection of Nick Ramsay. But the Tories failed to capture the Vale of Glamorgan, another Labour-held target seat which is Conservative at Westminster.

Labour also held on to the Plaid Cymru target seat of Llanelli, with Welsh government deputy transport minister Lee Waters being re-elected. Following his victory, Mr Waters said Mark Drakeford was ""definitely an asset"", due to his leadership during the pandemic. ""He may not be flashy, he may be a bit nerdy, a bit boring, he's a university professor, but thank God for him,"" he said. Health Minister Vaughan Gething also paid tribute to his party leader, saying: ""The recognition of the way Mark has run the Welsh government in this extraordinary time was undoubtedly a factor in the way that people have voted."" How to organise an election in a pandemic A really simple guide to the Welsh elections Five things to find out from the Welsh election Despite the challenges of the pandemic, more than 1.1 million people voted, making it the highest-ever turnout for a Senedd election at 46.6%. This beat the previous record of 46.3% at the first Senedd election in 1999, but is still significantly lower than turnout for general elections. Laura McAllister, professor of public policy at Cardiff University, said Labour had ""performed better than most people expected"". ""After 22 years in power, with a Conservative Party that was really strongly tipped to make significant breakthroughs, and of course Plaid Cymru biting its ankles as well, that's some achievement."" Political commentator Prof Roger Awan-Scully said: ""I think it's been an astonishingly resilient performance by the Welsh Labour Party, amidst disasters for Labour elsewhere in the UK. ""The Conservatives are also performing strongly, but not quite bringing it home in terms of the number of constituency victories that they might have expected. ""For Plaid Cymru I think this has to be said to be a deeply disappointing election."" Gareth Davies thanked voters for their trust in him The Vale of Clwyd was the only Conservative gain in Labour's ""red wall"" of seats in north Wales where the Tories had enjoyed success in the 2019 General Election. Winning candidate Gareth Davies, an NHS physiotherapist, said: ""It's a magnificent achievement. ""In 1999 I was a small boy, and now I'm in my 30s and I never thought back then I'd ever be in this position. So I feel really humbled."" Andrew RT Davies, leader of the Tories in the Senedd, said the result in the Vale of Clwyd was ""fantastic"". North Wales has been a fiercely contested battleground, with re-elected Aberconwy Tory MS Janet Finch-Saunders sayingshe had been ""horrified""by personal attacks which had hurt her family during the campaign. Labour's win in Alyn and Deeside represents the last of the red wall seats that the Conservatives had hoped to take in north east Wales. It's the last brick in the wall. But they have only managed in this election to take Vale of Clwyd in that region - by a small amount. So it counts as a disappointing set of results for the Conservatives. Labour, which has been in charge of the Welsh government for 22 years, is now set to remain in power for a sixth term with exactly half the seats in the Senedd chamber. Of the 60 members of the Senedd (MSs) being elected, 40 will serve constituencies and 20 will be elected to represent larger regional areas of North Wales, Mid and West Wales, South Wales West, South Wales Central and South Wales East. A party needs to win 31 seats to claim a majority but it has never happened, with Labour last time having 29 seats. It previously won 30 seats in 2003 and 2011. Social distancing and other Covid measures have delayed the count in many areas For Plaid Cymru, the party's Westminster leader Liz Saville Roberts painted a gloomy picture for their hopes of making inroads into Labour's grip on the south Wales valleys. She said the pandemic had meant ""ministers in the governments, both in Westminster and Cardiff, have had an immense platform over the last year"". It had been an ""extraordinarily different"" election, Ms Saville Roberts said, ""to anything that anybody has been used to, and it's been difficult for a party like Plaid to get the same sort of platform"". ""At the same time there's a real sense that our policy, our offer of policies, has offered something that was progressive and new and is, I hope, really the seeds for something in the future,"" she added. Adam Price, who held Carmarthen East and Dinefwr with a reduced majority, said he would not stand down as Plaid Cymru leader. Adam Price was re-elected in Carmarthen East and Dinefwr but saw his majority fall Despite no gains, Mr Price said the party had increased its share of the vote and its stance on independence had been a ""net positive"". ""I'm not walking away from anything, because this is the moment when Wales needs leadership,"" he said. ""This is a historic challenge, because of the way that the politics is moving in this island, but it's also a historic opportunity for us. ""We can move our nation forward and I'm looking forward to playing my part, it's not something that anyone can do on their own. ""I have a role to play, we all have a role to play and that's what's exciting about politics at the moment. Wales is on the move Wales is on the march. I'm going to be part of that.""

Eg 'W1A 1AA' or 'Westminster'   Meanwhile, the Welsh Liberal Democrats lost their constituency seat in Brecon and Radnorshire but won a list seat in Mid and West Wales with party leader Jane Dodds heading for the Senedd. Liberal Democrat peer Baroness Jenny Randerson said she did not think Welsh Labour would need the support of Ms Dodds to run a government as had happened with her predecessor, former Education Minister Kirsty Williams who stood down prior to the elections. ""I think Labour will have the numbers to just about manage on their own,"" said Baroness Randerson. Ian Price, director of CBI Wales, congratulated Labour. ""This is a critical time for the Welsh economy and the new parliament must have a laser-like focus on rebuilding from the devastating impact of the pandemic,"" he said. ""That means all parties pulling together and working with business to protect jobs, rebuild livelihoods and create a fair and sustainable recovery that addresses the longstanding structural challenges our economy faces."" The Abolish the Welsh Assembly Party was also hoping to make a breakthrough in the regional lists.

"Twitter has suspended an account sharing posts from former US president Donald Trump's new communications platform. The account claimed to be tweeting ""on behalf"" of Mr Trump. A spokesperson for the company said the account, @DJTDesk, violated theban evasion policy,externalby sharing content ""affiliated with a suspended account."" But the BBC found similar accounts still active on the social media platform. Mr Trump was permanently banned from Twitter in January after he voiced support for rioters who stormed the US Capitol.

"Nicola Sturgeon easily saw off a challenge from Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar in her Glasgow Southside constituency The SNP has won three key seats but its hopes of securing an overall majority in the Scottish Parliament election remain on a knife edge. The party has taken both Edinburgh Central - where former MP Angus Robertson was standing for the SNP - and Ayr from the Conservatives. It also won the East Lothian seat from Labour. But it fell short in other targets, with counting in the remaining seats due to resume on Saturday. No other constituencies have changed hands so far, with the SNP currently on 39 seats, the Liberal Democrats four, Tories two and Labour one. But the opposition parties will see their number of seats increase dramatically once the regional list results are finalised on Saturday. The story of the Scottish election so far Scottish election results in maps and charts Full details of the results from across Scotland,external Polling expert Prof Sir John Curtice said it was now unlikely, but not impossible, that the SNP would achieve an overall majority in the new Holyrood parliament. And he said there were clear signs that tactical voting by pro-UK voters in some parts of the country had been successful. The Alba Party, which was founded by former first minister and SNP leader Alex Salmond, looks unlikely to win any seats.

As the count resumed on Saturday, Aberdeenshire East was first to declare with the SNP's Gillian Martin holding her seat with a reduced majority of 1,889 over the Scottish Conservatives - who increased their vote share by 11%. Friday's results included First Minister Nicola Sturgeon - the SNP leader - easily holding off a challenge from Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar in her Glasgow Southside constituency. Ms Sturgeon won by 9,456 votes, only marginally lower than the 9,593 she won by in 2016. Turnout has been higher than anticipated in many areas, with the SNP's share of the vote falling in many of the early constituencies to declare but increasing in others. The A-Z of Scotland's constituencies,external When will we know the result of the Scottish election? BBC Scotland election results coverage When will my seat declare? Ms Sturgeon said that the SNP ""appears to be on course for a fourth consecutive election victory and to be on course to have the privilege of forming a government again"". She pledged to ""get back to work immediately"" and lead the country's Covid recovery. ""And then, when the time is right, to offer this country the choice of a better future,"" she added. It comes as UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson suggested he would reject any calls for a second independence referendum, saying it would be ""irresponsible and reckless"" right now. Asked if an SNP majority would mean there was a mandate for another vote, he toldthe Daily Telegraph,external: ""I think that count is still taking place and we'll have to see what happens. I listened to the Scottish election carefully. My impression was that they [the SNP] moved away from the idea of a referendum, and I think very wisely. ""I don't think this is anything like the time to have more constitutional wrangling, to be talking about ripping our country apart, when actually people want to heal our economy and bounce forward together. That's what people want."" John Swinney told BBC Breakfast he was 'confident' there would be a pro-independence majority However deputy first minister John Swinney toldBBC Breakfastthat his party would legislate for a second referendum if Mr Johnson were to block one. He said: ""We've said we will take forward legislation to have a legal referendum - we already have put in place some of the legislative arrangements for that process. We will embark on such an agenda should there be a majority for such a proposition in the Scottish Parliament."" Mr Swinney said that although he was waiting to see the ""electoral arithmetic"" of the final results, he was ""very confident"" there would be a majority of candidates ""elected on a programme to deliver a referendum on independence"". This election has a long way to go with a further 26 constituencies and all 56 regional list seats still to declare. While the SNP is on course to finish as the largest party, there are only limited opportunities left for them to do so with an overall majority. To achieve that they really need to hold all they have and pick up an additional constituency seat like Aberdeenshire West, where the Conservatives are defending a majority of 900 votes. There is also a possible pathway if they do better than expected on the regional lists which are very hard to predict because of the proportional voting system. If the SNP fall short of that outright majority they could enter a fourth term in office as a minority government (as they are now) or seek a more formal arrangement with another party - most likely the Greens. Together the SNP and the Greens will almost certainly have a pro-independence majority at Holyrood - committed to holding another referendum that the UK government seems determined to resist. A big wrangle over indyref2 is coming and it could end up in the UK Supreme Court. The constituencies that declared on Friday included eight of the SNP's top 10 target seats. The Conservatives held Dumfriesshire, which had been one of the SNP's goals, with Oliver Mundell increasing his majority, while Jackson Carlaw held the marginal Eastwood seat for the Tories from the SNP. And Labour's Daniel Johnson held off the SNP challenge in Edinburgh Southern and the party's deputy leader Jackie Baillie increased her majority over the SNP in Dumbarton. Labour increase majority in Dumbarton Jackson suspended over Yousaf confrontation Salmond says Alba may not win any seats Robertson takes Davidson's former seat The election is seen as being crucial to the future of the UK as the result could impact on whether or not there is a second referendum on Scottish independence. The SNP - which has formed the devolved Scottish government since 2007 -  will once again finish as the largest party, but is seeking to win an overall majority to strengthen the case for indyref2. Although it is not yet clear that it will win a majority by itself, there is likely to be a pro-independence majority in the parliament once the Scottish Greens are allocated regional list seats on Saturday.

SIGN UP FOR WALES ALERTS:Get extra updates on BBC election coverage Welsh Labour leader Mark Drakeford arrives to vote at St Catherine's Church Hall in Cardiff on Thursday After the polls officially closed Welsh Labour leader Mark Drakeford, who was first minister in the previous Welsh government, thanked 16 and 17 year olds who had ""exercised their new right to vote for the first time"". This video can not be played For the first time 16 and 17-year-olds were able to vote in Wales ""In the coming days, the political make-up of the next Senedd will become clear. We await those results,"" he said. Leader of the Welsh Conservatives, Andrew RT Davies, arrives to cast his vote at Llancarfan Village Hall Voters had cast their ballot to elect 40 Members of the Senedd (MSs) representing local constituencies, and 20 representing five large regions - North Wales, Mid and West Wales, South Wales West, South Wales Central and South Wales East. The regions elect four MSs each. How the BBC reports polling day Can I take a selfie at a polling station? Voters had got two ballots - one to back a candidate in their constituency, and one to support a party list of candidates or individual in their region. In the constituency ballots the candidate with the most votes wins, the same system used at UK general elections. Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price voted in the village of Pontargothi in Carmarthenshire But the ballot for the region is decided by a mathematical process in which people are elected more according to their share of the vote. The system takes into account who has won the constituency seats within that region and gives parties winning fewer or none of those constituencies a better chance of winning regional ones. The party or combination of parties that can command the greatest support in the Senedd after the election will form the next Welsh government. Welsh Liberal Democrats' leader Jane Dodds cast her ballot at Hay-on-Wye Bowling Club In police and crime commissioner elections you can vote for a first and second choice candidate. If no candidate gets more than 50% of the first choice votes, all except the top two candidates are eliminated. If your first choice candidate is eliminated, and your second choice is for one of the top two, your second choice is counted. Elections were also held on Thursday for the Scottish Parliament, and London's mayor and assembly. In England, PCC elections took place and voters went to the polls to elect local councils and directly elected mayors. There was also a by-election to choose a new MP at Westminster for Hartlepool.

"This video can not be played Gymnast Latalia Bevan and rugby international Angharad de Smet say the pandemic left their careers in the balance Increasing numbers of top female athletes will walk away from their sport due to difficulties during the pandemic, leading figures have warned. Gymnast Latalia Bevan, 20, and rugby international Angharad de Smet, 24, say Covid has left their careers in the balance. Sports sociologist Dr Ali Bowes said it had highlighted inequalities in sport. ""There are absolutely concerns women will walk away,"" she said. Wales rugby international de Smet, who has worked on the front line during the pandemic, said she's been left wondering whether ""the love of the game is enough?"" The 24-year-old from Ammanford, who was playing for Wales in the Autumn Internationals and as part of the sevens squad before Covid-19, was ""living the life of a professional athlete, without the pay cheque"". But as Wales began its first lockdown, games and training were cancelled. Angharad de Smet has been working on the Covid front line while also maintaining her fitness Over the last year, she said she's trained with just one kettlebell, unable to access proper equipment or facilities. Her last game of rugby was 14 months ago. The physiotherapist technician, who works on an elderly care ward in Swansea, said she has struggled to train after gruelling shifts in hospital. ""You've seen things you would hope to never see again in your lifetime, to come home and try and do a gym session... in your tiny kitchen... you think 'why am I bothering?'"" In 2019, the 24-year-old had been travelling to Worcester to train a couple of times a week after work, arriving home in the early hours. Athletics faces âhuge challengeâ to return Covid 'widened financial inequality in Wales' ""Nobody understands how much we give, just the wear and tear on your car, the petrol, putting food on the table, trying to get good food into you to aid recovery is expensive."" Now, she describes her future in the sport as ""uncertain"". ""Do I put my career first or do I pursue my dream of playing internationally, becoming a professional athlete? I am 24, should I have to make those sorts of calls already?"" Commonwealth Games silver medallist Latalia Bevan said the challenges of a global pandemic were a ""massive"" factor in her decision to retire from elite gymnastics earlier this year. Latalia Bevan has been working as a home carer since retiring ""It was so hard to keep your motivation, we'd do two or three Zooms a day, so my home turned into a gym and I'm from a family of seven."" The 20-year-old from Merthyr Tydfil, who won Wales' first gymnastics medal at the Gold Coast 2018 Games in Australia, had been training for 32 hours a week as well as studying at university in Cardiff. As a student, she used her loan to help cover costs after losing GB funding and while recovering from an operation. But after leaving her studies, she lost the financial support and struggled to adjust to a new life away from the gym after 14 years. She's been working as a home carer since retiring and said it's nice not to have to rely on her family to pay for things. Latalia won silver at the Gold Coast 2018 Commonwealth Games in Australia The former gymnast said she'd thought about returning to the sport but, if she did, she'd have to quit her job and that isn't an option with rent to pay. Covid: Athletes' safety concerns over lockdown exercise She's now focused on becoming a gymnastics coach and personal trainer. Alecs Donovan says the pandemic gave her the chance to sit back and prioritise seeing family and friends Rugby player Alecs Donovan ""would never have thought"" that at the end of the third lockdown she'd retire. With her yoga businesses closed, the 30-year-old said she was able to train ""more than ever"". The business owner said the pandemic has given her the chance to sit back and prioritise seeing family and friends. As a personal trainer who works with professional male athletes, she said it can be worse seeing their schedules and the support they get. She added she was aware of women who don't go for promotions because their current job allows them to play the sport, but she wonders what will happen when rugby stops. Dr Ali Bowes, senior lecturer in sociology of sport at Nottingham Trent University, said: ""It's one year on from lockdown and it's really obvious where the inequalities exist."" Her research, looking at the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on elite women's sport, found women struggled to access equipment, a gender ""play"" gap where men's sport returned faster and financial difficulties for women who were unable to play. ""There are absolutely concerns that women will walk away and we've seen that already with some examples in a number of sports where it's been too difficult for them to continue,"" she said. The sociologist is optimistic that discussions about the problems in women's sport, and the difficulties athletes face can be used for positive change. ""There's also been significant forward steps, and it's put equality really on the agenda for lots of sports organisations, teams, clubs and national governing bodies. There's no hiding place now.""
