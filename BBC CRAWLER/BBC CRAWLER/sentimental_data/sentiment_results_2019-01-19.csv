"NHSGGC said an investigation is under way and control measures have been put in place Two patients have died after contracting a fungal infection caused by pigeon droppings at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said an elderly patient died but from an unrelated cause. Another infected patient has also died but the factors contributing to the death are still being investigated. A non-public room, thought to contain machinery, was identified as a likely source. An investigation is under way. A NHSGGC spokesman said: ""Our thoughts are with the families at this distressing time. ""Due to patient confidentiality we cannot share further details of the two cases. ""The organism is harmless to the vast majority of people and rarely causes disease in humans."" NHSGGC confirmed a small number of vulnerable paediatric and adult patients are receiving medication to protect them against the airborne infection, which is a Cryptococcus species. Portable HEPA air filter units have been installed in specific areas as an additional precaution. This video can not be played Pigeon disease ""very unusual"" in the UK Earlier on Saturday Teresa Inkster, lead consultant for infection control, said: ""Cryptococcus lives in the environment throughout the world. It rarely causes infection in humans. ""People can become infected with it after breathing in the microscopic fungi, although most people who are exposed to it never get sick from it. ""There have been no further cases since the control measures were put in place."" Ms Inkster said experts are continuing to monitor the air quality. She added: ""It remains our priority to ensure a safe environment for patients and staff."" Prof Hugh Pennington, of Aberdeen University, said he was surprised to learn of the infection. The epidemiologist said: ""It is very unusual in the UK. ""It is quite common in other parts of the world, particularly in tropical parts and in the US and in countries like that, where they have more problems with this particular kind of fungus."" Prof Pennington said people with weak immune systems are most at risk. He added: ""When it gets into the blood stream a lot of people have fairly straightforward infections and it settles in the lungs but the big problem with this is that it can cause meningitis and, as we know, meningitis can be a very serious infection."" Prof Pennington said anti-fungal drugs are used to treat the infection but warned it can be fatal if it is not diagnosed. The expert said a key priority would have been stopping the airborne infection from entering the hospital's ventilation system. He added: ""Obviously they have stopped the pigeons getting into the machine room. ""It surprises me slightly that there was any there in the first place."" During the investigation, a separate issue arose with the sealant in some of the shower rooms. NHSGGC said repairs are underway and our maintenance team are working to remedy this issue as quickly as possible with the minimum disruption. As a further precaution, a specific group of patients are being moved within the hospital due to their clinical diagnosis and ongoing treatment.

"Carter Cookson died in hospital on Saturday evening A three-week-old baby who was in desperate need of a heart transplant has died, his parents have said. Carter Cookson, who was born prematurely on Boxing Day with heart problems, had suffered three cardiac arrests and was on a life-support machine. His parents Sarah and Chris Cookson had been running a social media appeal to find a donor. But on Saturday they posted on Facebook that he had ""gained his angel wings"". The post from Mrs Cookson, 44, said that their ""brave baby boy"" Carter ""could not fight anymore"" and had died at 17:44 GMT. The parents alsoposted on the Find a Heart for Carter Facebook page,external, saying: ""Thank you to everyone who has helped to try and find Carter's gift, we will be eternally grateful."" In 2013, Mr and Mrs Cookson lost their first son, Charlie, aged two. He died of an undiagnosed condition - unrelated to Carter's - which caused problems with his muscles and bones and compromised his immune system. Chris and Sarah Cookson have been with Carter at Newcastle's Freeman Hospital Writing on Facebook, Mrs Cookson added: ""We are heart broken....our two boys are in heaven without their Mammy and Daddy we feel so empty and our hearts will never recover. ""No more pain baby boy, No more tubes..be free with your big brother and Granda...until we can all be together again."" Thousands of people posted their condolences on the social media site beneath a final photograph of Carter. Baby 'has hours to find new heart' PM's pledge to baby needing new heart The Cooksons, from South Shields, South Tyneside, launched an appeal to find a new heart for Carter after being told a transplant was his only hope. Their plea for an organ donor for Carter was shared widely on social media. On Friday, they said doctors at Newcastle's Freeman Hospital had advised them that time was running out. Dozens showed their support for the family at a vigil in South Shields on Thursday Last week, South Shields Labour MP Emma Lewell-Buck raised the donor appeal at Prime Minister's Questions. Theresa May described it as a ""tragic case"" and highlighted the ""opt-out""organ donation system due to be introduced next year. A candlelit vigil was held for Carter outside South Shields Town Hall on Thursday evening. Mr and Mrs Cookson launched a charity supporting families of children with life-limiting illnesses in 2013 following the death of Charlie.

"This video can not be played Windsor Davies (right) with Christopher Mitchell in It Ain't Half Hot Mum Actor and star of It Ain't Half Hot Mum, Windsor Davies, has died. Davies, 88, who was best known as the sergeant major in the TV series, died on Thursday, his family said. Born in Canning Town, London, he returned to his father's home village, Nantymoel in Bridgend county, when World War Two broke out. His daughter Jane Davies said he and her mother, who died in September, left a family ""who will all remember them with love, laughter and gratitude"". The couple, who were married for 62 years, had retired to France. They had five children. Windsor Davies (middle) alongside Don Estelle and Melvyn Hayes in It Ain't Half Hot Mum It Ain't Half Hot Mum co-star Melvyn Hayes, who played Gunner/Bombardier Gloria Beaumont, called him ""one of the good guys"". Paying tribute to Davies, he said: ""I considered him my best friend, even though we hadn't been in contact for many years. ""To work with him was a pleasure, a sheer delight because he was so generous in his work. ""You couldn't buy him a drink because you'd go into a public house and they'd say 'Windsor has put some money behind the counter for you'. ""He was nothing like the character he played - he was a charming, quietly-spoken, gentle human being."" Obituary: A 'lovely boy' Allow Twitter content?

"High street retailer Superdrug is to introduce tougher mental health checks before performing cosmetic procedures, following criticism by the NHS. Prof Stephen Powis, the medical director of NHS England, said the injections risked fuelling mental health disorders - and the health service was left to pick up the pieces. Superdrug started offering Botox and dermal fillers last year. The retailer said it was ""fully committed"" to the issue. Botox is an injection of Botulinum toxin that relaxes muscles to temporarily hide lines and wrinkles Dermal fillers are injections under the skin that can fill skin creases or lead to bigger lips NHS Choices:Botox,externalandDermal fillers,external Superdrug's Skin Renew Service offers the cosmetic procedures to people over the age of 25,  surgeons have criticised the company for treating Botox and fillers as ""casual beauty treatments""on a par with having a wax. The NHS is concerned about the impact on people who are mentally ill, including with Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD), in which people are fixated on what they think are flaws in their appearance. The BDD Foundation says body dysmorphia can be a crippling illness and severely impair someone's life. Woman's Botox party warning after lip filler swelling Prof Powis wrote to Superdrug's chief executive, saying the company could do more to protect people who were seeking treatment because they were mentally unwell, or might have a mental health disorder triggered by treatment. Prof Powis said: ""Pressures on young people's mental health are greater than they ever have been, with families and the health service too often left to pick up the pieces. ""The lack of tough checks on cosmetic surgery means that the public is dependent on businesses taking voluntary steps to get their house in order, leaving people avoidably exposed to dangerous practices."" Superdrug said it already performs an hour-long consultation before cosmetic procedures take place and these include a mental health assessment. The company said it would now ask specific questions about Body Dysmorphic Disorder: ""We remain fully committed to including recommended protections for mental health. We met with the NHS to ensure we have the highest safety standards and quality of patient care."" Alana, who has BDD, told Radio 4's Today programme that prior to being treated for the condition she would ""beg and plead"" with her parents to access plastic surgery and cosmetic procedures. The 22-year-old believes that it would have been a ""real issue"" for her if these procedures had been available on the high street at the time. Kitty Wallace, a trustee with the BDD Foundation, said fewer than 10% of patients with BDD were satisfied with the results of their cosmetic procedures. She said: ""It is important that these measures are in place to protect such individuals from potentially damaging and unnecessary procedures. ""Although their anxiety might reduce temporarily, they will often find themselves fixating on another part of their body that they want to change. ""We commend that Superdrug will be screening for the disorder, and referring people who are positive to their GP and Mind."" The foundation has its own questionnaire, which asks questions about how much people fixate on their appearance and how much it affects their day-to-day life.

"At the age of 23, Kris Hallenga was diagnosed with terminal breast cancer. On average people given this diagnosis live for two-and-a-half years, but 10 years later she wants people to know that it is possible to beat the odds. A tightrope artist walks along the line created by Kris Hallenga's mastectomy scar. ""I got the tattoo maybe three years ago now, it's to represent the balance of any illness with life and everything else,"" she says. ""I didn't want to cover up the scar, I just wanted it to feature within the art piece."" Kris's friend, TV and radio presenter Fearne Cotton, designed her tattoo Kris has never tried to hide or deny her condition. Instead she has embraced it as part of her life. ""What happened to me couldn't really be changed, and I think getting to grips with accepting your situation is going to be much better than fighting something. That's why I don't see the cancer in my body as this enemy, because I don't think that's particularly healthy. I think we need to work with it rather than against it."" When diagnosed with advanced breast cancer in 2009, she decided not to get angry, but instead set up a charity called CoppaFeel, to raise awareness of the disease among young people and encourage them to check their breasts regularly. Even before her diagnosis, she had become aware how fragile life is. She was left shaken at 15 by the death of a grandmother. Then, five years later, her father died. ""When I was diagnosed at 23 I was already au fait with mortality and that we weren't going to live forever,"" she says. ""So I think that helped with my attitude and coping with the reality of the situation."" On 19 February, 10 years will have elapsed since the moment she was told she had stage-four breast cancer. ""Stage-one cancers are very small, limited to the breast,"" says Kris's doctor, consultant clinical oncologist Dr Duncan Wheatley. ""Stage two and three are when it's starting to spread to the lymph glands around the breast and then stage four is when it's spread from beyond the breast to somewhere distant, whether that's liver, lung, bone, brain."" He says there are different degrees of stage-four breast cancer, but they are nearly always incurable. Kris's cancer had already spread to her pelvis, liver and hips and she also had a tumour in her brain. ""When I was diagnosed, I didn't think that I would die within the two-and-a-half years - that is statistically what you're given when you're diagnosed with stage four - but then I also didn't think that I'd survive for a really long time. I just didn't really have any timeframe in mind."" She says no doctor has ever given her a personal prognosis, and she says she is glad about that, ""because I think that would have really held me back, and I don't believe in those timescales"". Her own doctor, Duncan Wheatley, says survival rates vary depending on the biology of the disease - some cancers can behave much worse than others even if they look the same. But there have also been scientific advances in the last 10 years, so quite a few of the drugs that Kris has been given were not around when she was first diagnosed. ""The treatment options are expanding,"" he says. ""So [we can] treat breast cancer more as a chronic disease rather than something that kills you rapidly, in the same way you treat high blood pressure and heart problems as a chronic disease that you don't get rid of but you can keep people going."" Breast cancer survival rates have been increasing over the last 40 years, according to Macmillan Cancer Support, thanks to improved treatments, increased awareness and faster diagnosis.In the 1970s, about five out of 10 women survived beyond five years after diagnosis, but now more than eight out of 10 do.,external The earlier the diagnosis the better the chances of survival.Nine out of 10 women live beyond five years with stage-one breast cancer, compared with one in 10 women who have been diagnosed with stage-four breast cancer.,external Patients like Kris who do much better than predicted are often referred to as ""long-term survivors"". It's written into the contracts of all CoppaFeel staff that they take the day off every 19 February and do something that reminds them why being alive is so great. This could be spending the day with family or going to see an exhibition they had been meaning to see. This year Kris is planning to have a party with friends and family. ""I would like to look back over the last 10 years and have a good laugh about all the silly things that we got up to and all the milestones for the charity. I think that will be really fun,"" she says. She has changed a lot as a person over the last 10 years, but one thing has always remained the same - her positivity. ""I wasn't a particularly confident person before I was diagnosed, so I wouldn't recognise the person that I was the day before I was told I had cancer, she is very strange to me now,"" says Kris, ""but then it has been 10 years and I think you change a lot between 23 and 33, so that's probably common for a lot of people. ""But I like who I am and I like who I've grown to be and if it's cancer that's done that, then so be it, I think that's OK."" Kris says her determination to raise awareness among young women has been ""one of the key factors as to why I'm still here"". ""I think having that purpose and having that need to get out of bed - I mean that seems very mundane - but when you're ill you don't sometimes fancy that."" She feels the real results of her work will not be seen until the young women she is urging to check their breasts start to reach middle age. The chance of developing breast cancer before the age of 30 is about0.05% or one in 2,000, which increases to one in 50 or 2% before the age of 50. One in three women diagnosed with breast cancer in the UK is aged over 70. ""When they get older and they hit the age bracket where breast cancer's really common, once they're at mammogram age, that's when we will probably see the real impact of our work, because they will know their boobs so well by then and get an early diagnosis."" Kris (left) with her twin sister Maren Although she stepped down as CoppaFeel's CEO a couple of years ago, she still works for the charity part-time. She also moved from London to Cornwall, where she lives with her cat, to be closer to her twin sister, Maren. ""I do a walk on the beach once a day,"" she says. ""I just find it so much easier and better to be calm and grateful in this huge expanse and so I love being outside. I love spending time with friends. I love cooking, I love food, I love all the good stuff, nothing crazy, my hobbies aren't mad. I just like being alive. ""Just spending a day with my twin sister where we go and try out a new cafÃ© and go for a walk and come home and watch some crap telly - that is a cool day for me."" But she also continues to sometimes do things that are out of the ordinary too. At the end of last year, for instance, she took part in a music video for the girl band, Little Mix. The song, called Strip, promoted female body confidence and brought together inspirational women. Kris Hallenga was one of the inspirational women in the Little Mix video for the song Strip ""I got to choose what I wore and I wanted my mastectomy tattoo to be visible,"" Kris says.

"Last year Arctic Monkeys manager Ian McAndrew called for Viagogo to be shut down Campaigners say ticket resale company Viagogo is not fully complying with a court order to reform its practices. In November, the firm was requiredto improve the information it gives to consumers, including details of the seller and seat numbers. The company now insists it is compliant with the legal requirements. But ticketing expert Reg Walker said Viagogo had not fulfilled its obligations and ""seems determined to sit outside the law."" Last year a court ordered,externalViagogo to ""overhaul"" the way it does business following legal action by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). Under the court order Viagogo was obliged to: Tell ticket buyers if there is a risk they will be turned away at the door Inform customers which seat they will get Inform buyers who is selling the ticket Make it easy for people to get their money back when things go wrong Prevent the sale of tickets a seller does not own and may not be able to supply Not give misleading information about the availability and popularity of tickets The deadline for Viagogo to comply with the order was mid-January - the same date by which other resale sites had agreed to change their practices. Viagogo ordered to clean up ticket sales How Ed Sheeran is tackling ticket touts The woman taking on ticket tout website On 17 January Viagogo announced that it had met the deadline and was now compliant. ""All tickets on Viagogo are valid and it is perfectly legal to resell a ticket or give it to someone else if you want to,"" the company said. Some ticketing experts and consumers say Viagogo is failing to fulfil its obligations as set out by the CMA. Adam Webb from the FanFair Alliance accused the company of ""minor tinkering"" rather than the ""complete overhaul"" expected. He said they have failed to make information transparent and to provide all details required - like seat numbers, trader contact details or provisions of resale restrictions. Fans might be able to discover who was selling the tickets - but only after they had started the buying process, he said. ""They [Viagogo] should show you who the trader is from the get-go, ""Trader contact details are not supplied. Viagogo only give you a name, or an initial. This is in breach of the 2002 eCommerce Directive."" Mr Webb suggested Viagogo was making misleading marketing messages about the demand level for certain events. Ticketing expert Reg Walker, from the consultancy Iridium, described as ""nonsense"" Viagogo's assertion that they are compliant with the court order. ""When you look at the relevant legislation in the Consumer Rights Act - which I helped draft - it says quite clearly that you must put your details on the website and you must have the seat, block and row,"" he said. ""It means every single listing on that website that does not contain these details is an offence. Viagogo seems determined to sit outside the law."" According to the CMA, if Viagogo fail to comply with the court order the company could face a fine. If particular, if serious breaches were proven then the court has the power to send certain individuals to prison. CMA chief executive Andrea Coscelli has said the watchdog would ""not hesitate"" to take action against companies that failed to meet their obligations. Claire Turnham was given an MBE after setting up the Victim of Viagogo group Campaigner Claire Turnham was awarded an MBE after obtaining close to Â£1 million of refunds from the site through her Victim of Viagogo group. She said she expected the CMA to act ""swiftly and strictly"" if Viagogo were found not to be compliant. ""As consumers, we are desperate to know ticket buyers will be able to buy tickets more safely and have certainty that they will be protected by the law,"" she said.

The force said earlier it was standard policy to breath test drivers involved in collisions and both had provided negative readings. On Sunday morning, well-wishers concerned for the duke were among those welcoming the Queen at a church service on her Sandringham Estate. Jane Watson, who travelled to St Peter's Church with a group of friends from Northamptonshire, called the duke ""a role model for a lot of people"".

"This video can not be played Footage of car on fire in Londonderry A bomb has exploded inside a car outside the courthouse in Londonderry. The explosion occurred in Bishop Street at about 20:15 GMT on Saturday, shortly after police received a warning. Officers were on the scene when the blast occurred. No one is believed to have been injured. Police had just started evacuating nearby buildings, including a hotel, when the explosion took place. A cordon remains in place at the scene. Local politicians have told the BBC that the vehicle was hijacked in Derry some time before the explosion. An eyewitness told the BBC: ""The remains of the car could still be seen burning in the middle of the road. ""A cordon has been set up around the scene and police are evacuating more buildings on Bishop Street."" The cordon remained in place on Sunday morning as officers inspect the scene In a statement issued on Facebook, the PSNI said: ""As far as we know no one [is] injured."" However, they said that there is another car they ""are not happy about"" and are evacuating the area and advising residents in the area to make preparations to leave. Greg McLaughlin, who lives nearby, said his windows shook with the force of the blast. ""It was very, very loud. I knew right away this was a bomb,"" he said. ""We knew it was quite close. ""You could see the ball of fire on the street. It  sounded to me like a very significant blast. I haven't heard anything like it in Derry for quite a while."" Businesses and other properties have been evacuated and the cordon on Bishop Street has been extended. One business owner said she heard a bang and was lucky to be inside at the time. She said she could have been on the street minutes later. Bishop Street is within Derry's famous city walls. The PSNI has asked members of the public to stay away. Colin Neill, chief executive of Hospitality Ulster, said the explosion had caused major disruption in the Bishop Street area of the city. ""This has to be condemned in its strongest terms, taking place on a Saturday evening when many people are out enjoying themselves. ""The loss of trade for the local hospitality sector and the impact that this will have on tourism and the local economy benefits no one."" The Northern Ireland secretary, Karen Bradley, said she was concerned at the reports coming from Londonderry and was ""being kept informed by PSNI"". Sinn FÃ©in MP Elisha McCallion said the incident had ""shocked the local community"". ""In particular, there are many elderly residents who live in the area who have been alarmed by this incident,"" she said. SDLP MLA Mark H Durkan tweeted: ""Whoever is responsible for this explosion outside Bishop Street Courthouse in Derry clearly hasn't got the message that the people of Derry DO NOT want this on our streets."" The DUP MLA, Gary Middleton, described the incident as a ""disgraceful act of terrorism"". His party leader Arlene Foster tweeted: ""This pointless act of terror must be condemned in the strongest terms. Only hurts the people of the city. ""Perpetrated by people with no regard for life. Grateful to our emergency services for their swift actions which helped ensure there have been no fatalities or injuries."" The Irish tÃ¡naiste (deputy prime minister) Simon Coveney condemned the attack. ""There is no place and no justification possible for such acts of terror, which seek to drag Northern Ireland back to violence and conflict,"" he wrote on Twitter.

"This video can not be played Federal workers queue up for free food US President Donald Trump says he will make a ""major announcement"" later on his Mexican border wall, an issue that has partially shut down government. The shutdown, now in its fifth week, is the longest in US history and has left 800,000 federal workers unpaid. Correspondents say Mr Trump may offer a concession on so-called Dreamers, who entered the US illegally when young. Ahead of the speech, rival Democrats quickly described the expected moves as ""unacceptable"" and a ""non-starter"". Why has the US government shut down? Six ways the US shutdown ends Mr Trump is demanding $5.7bn (Â£4.5bn) in funding for the wall and insists it is needed to end a security crisis on the southern border. The Democrats call it a waste of taxpayers' money. It will be from the White House on Saturday afternoon, although it has been put back an hour to 16:00 local time (21:00 GMT). Allow Twitter content?

Mr Trump had a brief exchange with reporters on Saturday morning but gave little away, saying: ""I think it'll be an important statement."" How much of Trump's wall has been built? Sixteen ways the US shutdown is hurting How will history judge President Trump? The BBC's David Willis in Washington says Mr Trump might be poised to offer a concession on the Dreamers, who entered the United States with their parents illegally. Donald Trump is unlikely to declare a national emergency on the wall - yet The Dreamers are currently protected from deportation under a programme that allows them to work but not get citizenship. Mr Trump has been trying to rescind the programme. Sources told US media Mr Trump may extend protection for Dreamers for three years and also extend visas for Temporary Protection Status holders. More than 300,000 people from countries affected by war or disasters are allowed to live and work in the US under TPS, another system Mr Trump opposes. Mr Trump will continue to demand $5.7bn for the wall, the sources say. They also say it is unlikely he will declare a national emergency over the wall. Such a declaration would free up funds, probably from defence department spending, but be hugely controversial and would almost certainly spark legal challenges. Not if a statement by Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi,externalis anything to go by. This video can not be played Five questions about Trump's border wall The statement read: ""Unfortunately, initial reports make clear that his proposal is a compilation of several previously rejected initiatives, each of which is unacceptable and in total, do not represent a good faith effort to restore certainty to people's lives."" The Democrats continue to say they will not negotiate until government is reopened. There is also no end to the personal rancour. On Saturday, Mr Trump said Ms Pelosi was ""under total control of the radical left"". There are no talks planned either. The Democrats are themselves working on legislation to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on other border security issues, including hiring more immigration judges. Some of the 800,000 federal employees who have been going unpaid since 22 December are in increasingly dire straits. More than 1,500 appeals have been set up by them on crowdfunding site GoFundMe, seeking a financial lifeline to pay rent or feed and clothe their children. In desperation, the Department of Agriculture, the Internal Revenue Service and the Federal Aviation Administration have just recalled more than 50,000 employees, who must work without pay.

"More than 4,200 migrants reportedly crossed to Europe in the first 16 days of 2019 About 170 people are feared to have died in two separate Mediterranean shipwrecks, the UNHCR says.

"The way we all talk about people moving to a different country can be confusing. You'll have heard the different terms: migrants, refugees, asylum seekers and immigrants. There has been a small spike in the number of people crossing the English Channel to get to the UK in the last few months, causing the debate to resurface. Many of those trying to reach Britain are from Iran and Pakistan. But is there a correct way to describe them? Dr. Charlotte Taylor is a senior lecturer at the Centre for Migration at the University of Sussex. She writes about how the media use language to describe people crossing borders. We got her help to explain more about some of the terms we keep hearing. People cue for support in Spain The term you might hear most often. This is a person who moves from one place to another, in order to find work or better living conditions. So if you live in the UK and decide to head off to work in Spain for a few months this summer, you could be described as a migrant. Charlotte Taylor says a migrant can be a safe term: ""It is at the moment, but it won't necessarily continue to be a safe term. They change over time"". Where it gets a bit more tricky is political migration. This can be when someone moves to get away from a certain regime. Charlotte does have concerns about words used around migration such as ""wave, flow, flooded by"". She believes this type of language can mean people in a country where migrants are regularly arriving can see them as ""products not people"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron wascriticised in 2015for talking about ""a swarm of people coming across the Mediterranean, seeking a better life, wanting to come to Britain"". This is when a person comes to live permanently in a foreign country. They don't have to have been forced from or pushed out of their own country, it can be a choice. There is something very different about an illegal and legal immigrant, however valid the reasons for movement. One has been allowed to come to a country through approved documents - an illegal immigrant has not. Charlotte Taylor says media in the UK often discuss immigration and not emigration, which is when people leave their home country. ""Emigration has nearly dropped out of conversation,"" she says. She thinks, despite an improvement in tone over the last 30 years, it's partly down to some hostility towards immigration. ""They are now seen as really separate processes. People don't recognise the similarities."" A refugee is a person who has been forced to leave their country in order to escape war, persecution, or natural disaster. ""It's a very different kind of status,"" says Dr. Charlotte Taylor. ""As soon as you acknowledge someone is a refugee you acknowledge they have a certain set of rights. ""They have been driven by circumstances beyond their control."" A group rescued in the Mediterranean Sea This person could be a combination of all of the above, although they are asking for international protection in another country. The Home Secretary Sajid Javid questioned whether people in boats travelling from France to the UK were genuine asylum seekersearlier this month. Some political opponents and campaigners said his comments were ""deeply concerning"". Mr Javid's argument was that some of the people were coming from France - which is deemed a safe country - rather than their place of origin. Asylum seeker is the term Charlotte feels comfortable with using for people coming on these small, often unsafe, boats across The Channel. ""If someone is seeking asylum, they are seeking asylum. ""I was very surprised to see that distinction between genuine and non-genuine asylum. It may be rejected but the seeking [part] is a fact."" EU rules allow a country such as the UK to return an adult asylum seeker to thefirst European country they reached.,external Asylum seekers often say they want to come to the UK because they want to speak English, and because they have family connections in the country.

"Libya's coastguard intercepts more boats carrying migrants Migrants and asylum seekers crossing the Mediterranean now face an even deadlier journey then they have in the past, the UN refugee agency has warned. In a report, the agency says that while the number of people arriving in Europe has fallen significantly, the number of deaths has risen sharply. Traffickers are having to take greater risks as there is more surveillance from the Libyan coastguard, it says. More than 1,600 people have died trying to reach Europe so far this year. In the central Mediterranean, one person died or went missing for every 18 people who crossed to Europe between January and July 2018, compared to one death for every 42 people who crossed in the same period in 2017, the report said. Seven of those incidents have been since June alone, the UNHCR said. Who is responsible for migrants at sea? Med migrant crisis: A mess - or cynical politics? As the number of those trying to cross falls, Europe should focus less on managing numbers and instead on saving lives, the agency says in itsreport,external. On the central Mediterranean route (from northern Africa to southern Europe) so far this year, there have been 10 separate incidents in which 50 or more people died - most after departing from Libya. Libya's coastguard intercepts more and more boats carrying migrants, increasing the likelihood that those on board may die during the Mediterranean journeys, the UN refugee agency says. ""The reason the traffic has become more deadly is that the traffickers are taking more risk, because there is more surveillance exercised by the Libyan coastguards,"" said Vincent Cochetel, UNHCR's special envoy for the central Mediterranean. ""They are trying to cut the costs: it costs them more to keep those people here longer in their warehouses, under captivity."" Is Italy taking in thousands of 'non-refugees'? Matt Saltmarsh from the agency said much more needed to be done. ""We are calling for the European authorities in particular to come up with a co-ordinated strategy whereby boats can be systematically disembarked in different parts of Europe and where asylum claiming conditions and reception centres are in place ready to receive those people who arrive,"" he told the BBC. The EU has stepped up co-operation with the Libyan coastguard to intercept migrant boats. But people-smuggling gangs have flourished in Libya's chaos, charging desperate migrants thousands of dollars per head. The EU Commission has proposed ""regional disembarkation platforms"" in North Africa, where the UN and other agencies could screen those who have a genuine claim to asylum in Europe. Those not eligible would be offered help to resettle in their home countries. But processing centres outside the EU must not become a ""Guantanamo Bay"" for migrants, EU Migration Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos warned. The EU also aims to beef up its Frontex border guard force to 10,000 staff by the end of 2020.

"The variation in the availability of GPs in different parts of England is shocking, doctors' leaders say. A BBC analysis has found close to a threefold difference between the areas with the most and fewest doctors. In one area - Swale in Kent - there is only one GP for every 3,300 patients, while in Rushcliffe in Nottinghamshire it is just under one for every 1,200. The Royal College of GPs said the shortages put care at risk, but NHS chiefs said issues were being tackled. More doctors are being trained and community services have been made a priority for investment under the 10-year plan announced earlier this month. Millions miss out on seven-day GP access Have waits for GP appointments got longer? However, RCGP chairwoman Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard said none of that addressed the urgent problems the profession was facing. She said the differences in the number of GPs was ""shocking"" and ""surprising"". ""It suggests there are areas of the country that are really struggling to get the GPs they need. ""Over the past decade, general practice has not received the investment it needs."" She believes the health service in England is 6,000 doctors short of what it needs - it currently has just over 34,000 - and the problems meant care was ""not safe"" in some places. Patients Association chief executive Rachel Power said the findings were ""worrying"". She said as well as risking safety, shortages also meant ""increased difficulty in securing an appointment, and longer waits"". The analysis looks at the number of patients per GP in each local NHS area - known as clinical commissioning groups. It shows a threefold difference between the areas with the most GPs and least. Worst areas (patients per GP) Swale: 3,342 Horsham and Mid Sussex: 2,997 Bradford City: 2,587 Thanet: 2,520 Bexley: 2,479 Best areas (patients per GP) Rushcliffe: 1,192 Camden: 1,227 Liverpool: 1,283 North Derbyshire: 1,286 Corby: 1,369 There is no official recommendation for how many patients a GP should have. That is because the demand each patient places on their GP is different. Older patients, young children or people with long-term conditions, such as diabetes, will need to see their GPs more than others. If a doctor has a lot of these patients on their books, they will not be able to cope with as many patients. That could be behind some of the differences that are being seen, but not all, the RCGP said. The data provided by NHS Digital only goes back to 2015. In that time it shows the number of GPs being employed has fallen slightly while their patient population has increased. For the average GP this means their caseload has increased by nearly 80 patients to 1,734. NHS bosses believe that will improve in the coming years. NHS England is increasing the proportion of the budget spent on general practice in a bid to recruit 5,000 more GPs. There are signs that is beginning to have an impact. A few years ago one in 10 training places were going unfilled. But last year they were all filled - in fact extra places were opened up as 3,400 people went into training. The RCGP warned this will take some time to have an impact, given the number of years it takes to train a doctor. The college would like to see more incentives to encourage doctors to work in areas where there are shortages. In the past, ""golden hellos"" worth Â£20,000 have been used to attract GPs to some areas. A spokesman for NHS England also pointed out that there were thousands of nurses, pharmacists and other health staff working alongside GPs and, with the extra investment being made in the NHS, these staff would help ""free up extra resource for GP services in every community"".

"Security guard Tudor Simionov was photographed hours before he was killed Two ""dangerous individuals"" wanted in connection with the fatal stabbing of a security guard at a party in London's West End on New Year's Eve are being hunted by police. Tudor Simionov, 33, was attacked as he tried to stop gatecrashers getting into a party at Fountain House in Park Lane in the early hours of 1 January. The Met Police wants to trace Ossama Hamed, 25, and Nor Aden Hamada, 23. A woman has been charged with perverting the course of justice. Det Insp Garry Moncrieff, from the Homicide and Major Crime Command, said: ""Ossama Hamed and Nor Aden Hamada are dangerous individuals who need to be apprehended. ""I am not willing to speculate on where they may be but rest assured we are working with colleagues to ensure that if they are in this country, or overseas, we will track them down."" Anyone who sees Ossama Hamed, left, and Nor Hamada should dial 999 immediately, police said Two of Mr Simionov's colleagues, aged 29 and 37, were also stabbed during an altercation, as was a 29-year-old woman. All have since been released from hospital, police said. Shaymaa Lamrani, 26, of Northolt, was charged on Friday with perverting the course of justice, the Met said. She will appear at magistrates court later. A man has also been charged with firearms offences in relation to an incident at Fountain House which happened within minutes of the killing. The son of the banned radical cleric Abu Hamza,Imran Mostafa Kamel, was charged with possession of a firearmwith intent to cause fear or danger, and possession of a firearm when prohibited for life. He is next due to appear at court on 31 January. Police said the incident was not related to Mr Simionov's stabbing.

"Last year Arctic Monkeys manager Ian McAndrew called for Viagogo to be shut down Campaigners say ticket resale company Viagogo is not fully complying with a court order to reform its practices. In November, the firm was requiredto improve the information it gives to consumers, including details of the seller and seat numbers. The company now insists it is compliant with the legal requirements. But ticketing expert Reg Walker said Viagogo had not fulfilled its obligations and ""seems determined to sit outside the law."" Last year a court ordered,externalViagogo to ""overhaul"" the way it does business following legal action by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). Under the court order Viagogo was obliged to: Tell ticket buyers if there is a risk they will be turned away at the door Inform customers which seat they will get Inform buyers who is selling the ticket Make it easy for people to get their money back when things go wrong Prevent the sale of tickets a seller does not own and may not be able to supply Not give misleading information about the availability and popularity of tickets The deadline for Viagogo to comply with the order was mid-January - the same date by which other resale sites had agreed to change their practices. Viagogo ordered to clean up ticket sales How Ed Sheeran is tackling ticket touts The woman taking on ticket tout website On 17 January Viagogo announced that it had met the deadline and was now compliant. ""All tickets on Viagogo are valid and it is perfectly legal to resell a ticket or give it to someone else if you want to,"" the company said. Some ticketing experts and consumers say Viagogo is failing to fulfil its obligations as set out by the CMA. Adam Webb from the FanFair Alliance accused the company of ""minor tinkering"" rather than the ""complete overhaul"" expected. He said they have failed to make information transparent and to provide all details required - like seat numbers, trader contact details or provisions of resale restrictions. Fans might be able to discover who was selling the tickets - but only after they had started the buying process, he said. ""They [Viagogo] should show you who the trader is from the get-go, ""Trader contact details are not supplied. Viagogo only give you a name, or an initial. This is in breach of the 2002 eCommerce Directive."" Mr Webb suggested Viagogo was making misleading marketing messages about the demand level for certain events. Ticketing expert Reg Walker, from the consultancy Iridium, described as ""nonsense"" Viagogo's assertion that they are compliant with the court order. ""When you look at the relevant legislation in the Consumer Rights Act - which I helped draft - it says quite clearly that you must put your details on the website and you must have the seat, block and row,"" he said. ""It means every single listing on that website that does not contain these details is an offence. Viagogo seems determined to sit outside the law."" According to the CMA, if Viagogo fail to comply with the court order the company could face a fine. If particular, if serious breaches were proven then the court has the power to send certain individuals to prison. CMA chief executive Andrea Coscelli has said the watchdog would ""not hesitate"" to take action against companies that failed to meet their obligations. Claire Turnham was given an MBE after setting up the Victim of Viagogo group Campaigner Claire Turnham was awarded an MBE after obtaining close to Â£1 million of refunds from the site through her Victim of Viagogo group. She said she expected the CMA to act ""swiftly and strictly"" if Viagogo were found not to be compliant. ""As consumers, we are desperate to know ticket buyers will be able to buy tickets more safely and have certainty that they will be protected by the law,"" she said.

"Skengdo and AM were sentenced to nine months in jail suspended for two years Two rappers have been given suspended sentences for performing drill music which incited violence against rival gang members. Skengdo, real name Terrell Doyley, and AM, real name Joshua Malinga, pleaded guilty to breaching a gang injunction at Croydon County Court, police say. The injunction was made against the pair last year because they were members of a gang in south London. They were sentenced to nine months in jail suspended for two years. The Metropolitan Police says Skengdo and AM, both 21, breached an interim gang injunction which was made in August last year. ""It was breached when they performed drill music that incited and encouraged violence against rival gang members and then posted it on social media,""it said in a statement,external. Their manager TK told the Press Association the musicians were not involved in gang violence. He said they pleaded guilty after a video of one of their live performances was uploaded to the internet without their knowledge. The Met's top officer Cressida Dick previously linked drill music to an increase in violence in London The interim injunction was made against the rappers because they were members of a gang in Lambeth, south London - and were linked to rising violence in the borough,police said on Friday,external. The injunction was brought into full force during hearings held on 10 and 14 January. It will last for two years. Detective Inspector Luke Williams, of Lambeth and Southwark's Gangs Unit, said: ""I am pleased with the sentences passed in these cases which reflect that the police and courts are unwilling to accept behaviour leading to serious violence. ""The court found that violence in drill music can, and did in this case, amount to gang-related violence."" 1Xtra to carry on playing drill music Using drill to turn lives around Drill music video stopped by armed police TK, the director of Finesse Foreva, said the last time either of the rappers ""might have had a run-ins with the law was when they were 16 and 17"". He said at a hearing in January, police had tried to link Skengdo and AM to the history of crime in Brixton - which is in the Lambeth borough. ""They didn't find nothing on them in terms of violence because they don't have nothing on them."" He added: ""Why the Met's probably done that is because they want to affect their lives, scare big venue owners off."" Skengdo and AM have performed at Reading and Leeds festivals and have appeared on 1Xtra. They performed on Kenny Allstar's 1Xtra show on 11 January - he described them as ""one of the hottest duos in UK drill music"".

"More than five million people across England are unable to book an appointment with a GP outside of working hours. BBC analysis of official data shows 10% of registered patients live in areas where there is no access to GPs on evenings and at weekends. Labour has accused the government of ""breaking its promises"". NHS England said it was still on target to provide access to extended care for all patients by 1 October. Our analysis shows: More than 22 million people - or 40% of patients registered with GPs - now have ""seven-day 8am to 8pm"" access to GPs - defined as full provision by NHS England Just over half the population have access to partial provision. This is when a GP practice can offer the minimum of ninety minutes of bookable appointments once a week Only two areas offer full provision to GPs for all patients Some 5.4 million people - or 10% of patients - had no access to GPs outside of normal working hours Former Prime Minister David Cameron made a promise everyone in England would have access to GP services seven-days a week by 2020,at the Conservative party conference in 2014.. The plans have since been brought forward.  From October, it will be mandatory for all Clinical Commissioning Groups to put in place arrangements for extended access to general practice. The latest data - from March and collated bi-annually from surveys filled out by GPs - shows widespread regional variation. In Sefton in Merseyside, for example, two thirds of patients had no access to GPs outside of working hours, the highest percentage in England. That compares to Herefordshire and Rushcliffe in Nottinghamshire, where every patient had access to full provision. A spokesman for NHS South Sefton CCG said extended access to general practice was ""not compulsory"", but it was ""undertaking a procurement exercise"" to roll services out from October. Self-employed, mother of three, Pragya Agarwal is registered at a GP practice commissioned by NHS Southport and Formby CCG. No practices provide a full 8am-8pm service, but 94% of patients have access to some form of partial provision. Pragya said it was often impossible to access a doctor's appointment. She said ""You call in the morning to make an appointment at literally one minute to 8am and it's impossible to get through, the lines are jammed straight away, everyone is trying to call at the same time and there just aren't enough appointments in the day. ""Then usually you're offered an appointment a week, eight to ten days aheadâ¦ the access to appointments is very limited. It's really difficult unless you sound really, really urgent."" Pragya said ""I hate to malign the NHS in any way, everyone works incredibly hard. Our local GP seems under a lot of pressure to meet deadlines, so when you do see someone for five to 10 minutes it's very rushed."" Olivia Djouadi, 46, from Bromley in south London, where 94% of patients have full access to extended hours appointments.  She is self-employed and cares for a disabled teenage son. ""I call for an appointment at 8 o'clock on a Monday morning and can be given an appointment for a couple of weeks time. ""At 8 o'clock, it seems they've booked all the slots for the day. If you are even slightly late, like 8.15, there is no chance of seeing someone that day. ""I've often been given an appointment for a couple of weeks time. I have diabetes and lots of medical needs so I can't really wait a couple of weeks. If I'm concerned, I will often go to the in-house GP at A&E ... and I sit and wait. ""I have a teenager in a wheelchair and work full-time, so I'd have to cancel his school day if I have to wait at A&E to see someone because I might not be back when his transport brings him home from school."" A spokesperson for NHS Rushcliffe CCG said it was proud of the extended hours service it provides, through '""vanguard funding"". In 2015, it became one of fifty 'vanguard' sites createdand funded by the NHS. The purpose was to bring together hospitals, community services, GPs and care homes to provide extended care. NHS Herefordshire CCG has been able to offer full extended access, through the GP Access Fund. Originally called the Prime Minister's Challenge Fund, it became one of twenty-one pilot areas funded in 2015 to provide extended GP hours. That has enabled Herefordshire to commission a GP Federation to provide three hub sites across the county, to provide seven-day a week service. Christine Price from Healthwatch Herefordshire, the independent champion for people who use health services in the county, said though people want convenience of care, how to get to services for those living in rural communities is an issue. Christine said ""People thought their own local GP would be open as part of extended access, but it's not realistic with twenty-four practices across the whole county. ""With limited transport between market towns and rural areas, the reality is not everyone can access services. ""If all patients wanted to use it, it wouldn't have the capacity for them to use it. ""People without money, friends and family nearby struggle to access services outside of their immediate area. It's not there for everyone in reality."" Doctors' groups have questioned the government's priority of extended access at a time when there is a critical shortage of GPs. In the recent British Medical Association's paper, Dr Richard Vautrey, its GP Committee chair, said the government should address ""increased demand and unmanageable GP workloads"". The Royal College of GPs said it wants to give patients access to services they need but states there are not enough GPs to provide this. Its chair, Helen Stokes-Lampard, has called for funding for an extra GP in every practice in England. Labour's Shadow Secretary of Health and Social Care, Jonathan Ashworth MP has been critical of the handling of the extended access scheme. He said ""This is yet more evidence that the Tories have broken their promises on access to GPs seven days a week. ""The truth is that years of austerity has taken its toll on general practice. We need a serious long term investment plan for primary care."" A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said it had invested an extra Â£2.4bn a year into general practice by 2021. It said alternative data, recorded in May 2018, sourced monthly from Clinical Commissioning Groups, suggests 55% of the population now had access to 8am-8pm GP services.  NHS England has declined to release this data. A spokesman for NHS England said: ""The NHS is investing at least Â£258m this year to offer improved access to general practice, including evening and weekend appointments. This is ahead of schedule with appointments available to more than half the country now, and they will be available across the whole country by October this year."" A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said it wants everyone to have access to evening and weekend GP appointments and ""already millions have benefitted"" from the plans. The BBC also analysed similar data from Wales and Scotland.  In Northern Ireland, there was no comparable data available. In Wales, five out of seven Health Boards provided no out-of-hours appointments after 18:30, in data provided by the Welsh government. GPs chose whether to provide 24-hour care for their patients or to transfer responsibility to local Health Boards. The Welsh government said its figures ""show more appointments are available for people at more convenient times"". In Scotland, 3% of patients are registered at a GP practice that has opted in to provide out-of-hours services, in data provided by the Information Services Division (ISD) on behalf of the Scottish Government. A Scottish Government spokesman said GPs were not contractually required to provide care, and it was the responsibility of local Health Boards. ""Everyone in Scotland has access to out-of-hours services - regardless of where they live,"" he added.

"Theresa May needs to become a mediator to help break the Brexit deadlock in Parliament, former prime minister John Major has said. He wants MPs to be given a vote on all Brexit options, indicating their preference on the way forward. Mrs May should consider dropping her red lines ""in the national interest"" and become a facilitator to find out what Parliament wants, he said. Tory Brexit supporter Suella Braverman dismissed his ""Remainer elite"" views. She said: ""Thank you Sir John, but no thanks."" Liam Fox yet to seal no-deal trade agreements Boles: Ministers back 'block no-deal plan' Where Tory tribes stand on Brexit Meanwhile, shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer has said there are ""in reality, just two remaining options"" for Brexit - to instruct the government to negotiate a close relationship with the EU, including a customs union, or for there to be a public vote. He told the Fabian Society conference in London that it ""seems inevitable"" the government will have to apply for an extension to Article 50. Labour has responsibility ""in this moment of national crisis"" to ""offer a constructive path forward"", said Sir Keir, adding that there are ""no easy routes out of this mess"". ""It's now time for an open and frank debate about how we break the deadlock,"" he said. It comes after Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn refused to meet Mrs May for talks to discuss a way forward, unless she takes the possibility of a no-deal Brexit off the table. Sir Keir also said what Mrs May is doing is ""not resilient, but reckless"", and that she was ""ploughing on without a plan"" and ""reducing the time for a credible alternative to emerge"". Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme earlier, Sir John warned that no deal would be the ""worst of all outcomes"". He said that ""millions of people"" - both individuals and businesses - would be hurt in such a scenario. ""Tinkering"" with her deal will not make a difference to the current situation, he added. By Nick Eardley, political correspondent Westminster is currently stuck on what happens next with Brexit. There are a range of different views in Parliament, but no certainty that any of them would command majority support. Indicative votes are a proposed solution. MPs would be given a free vote on various proposals, from a second referendum to a customs union to a free trade agreement. The idea goes that this would allow MPs to express what they really think, free from party commitments. It could, proponents believe, end the log-jam. But as we've documented at length in recent weeks, there is no guarantee it would. One thing is certain just now; a lot of work still needs to be done if a consensus is to be found. Sir John said the prime minister had been ""handed a poisoned chalice"" and that things had been ""extremely difficult"" for her. ""Her position has been all but impossible,"" he said, adding that Parliament was ""running out of time"". If Mrs May does not drop her red lines ""in the national interest"", then her options are either for the Cabinet or Parliament to decide or for there to be another referendum ""now more facts are known than were known in 2016"", Sir John argued. He said while Cabinet is too split to reach an agreement, there is hope that Parliament could reach a consensus, with Mrs May as a mediator. Please upgrade your browser He told the programme: ""The prime minister argued valiantly for her deal. She fought for it but the House of Commons killed it and killed it comprehensively. ""The prime minister still needs a deal. If she can't deliver one that Parliament accepts, then she needs to become a facilitator, a mediator, to find out what Parliament will accept."" Ideally, all party leaders would give their MPs a free vote to allow an ""honest representation"" of opinion. He called for compromise to prevent any further splits, as ""no one is going to get their way"". It is now very unlikely we will leave the EU on 29 March ""bar a miracle"", he added, arguing that a delay would be ""wise"". Mrs Braverman said some of the options being put forward - including a customs union, allowing continued free movement of people or holding another referendum - would be ""clear breaches"" of promises made by Mrs May, and ignore the will of the people. She has also called for the Irish border backstop - the position of last resort, to maintain an open border on the island of Ireland - to be scrapped.

"This video can not be played Suspected fuel thieves have been blamed for rupturing the pipeline Mexican authorities now say at least 79 people were killed in Friday night's fuel pipeline blast. It is believed the explosion occurred after the line was ruptured by suspected fuel thieves in the town of Tlahuelilpan, in Hidalgo state. Officials say scores of people had been scrambling to fill up containers and were engulfed in an inferno. Dozens of charred bodies remain at the scene, which is cordoned off by security forces. Hidalgo state governor Omar Fayad said74 people had been hospitalised after the blast.,external Locals said President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador's new policy to crack down on fuel theft had created shortages. Why are there fuel shortages in Mexico? ""Everyone came to see if they could get a bit of gasoline for their car,"" farmer Isaias GarcÃ­a told Reuters news agency. ""There isn't any in petrol stations."" Relatives gather at the scene as forensic workers carry out inspections Distraught relatives have continued to gather at site of the explosion. Forensic experts have been photographing remains amid a backdrop of burned clothing and discarded fuel buckets. A few litres of fuel are worth more than the daily minimum wage in Mexico. Pemex, Mexico's state-owned petroleum company, said the fire had been caused by illegal tapping. It is believed thieves drilled through the Tula-Tuxpan pipeline - just a few miles away from a large refinery - causing a large jet of gasoline to rise into the air. Mexican officials say up to 800 people, seeing the gasoline geyser, then flocked around it to fill up containers. It erupted into flame a couple of hours later. At a press conference, Pemex chief executive Octavio Romero said the firm had been aware of a leak along the pipeline at 16:50 local time. Mr Romero said a valve had been closed to stem the leak, but he did not say what time it was shut. The pipeline has been closed since late December because of repeated hits by gangs. Since reopening on 16 January, it has been targeted four more times, according to Pemex. Some locals criticised security forces at the scene for not warning people more forcibly to get away from the leaking fuel. But President LÃ³pez Obrador defended the army against criticism, saying only 25 soldiers were present and villagers ignored warnings not to get close. He also avoided criticising the people, saying if they had to resort to ""extremes"" by stealing fuel ""it's because they were abandoned"". President LÃ³pez Obrador added that, even if the pipeline had been sealed immediately after the leak, 10,000 barrels-worth of gasoline would have still been trapped in the section of pipeline between Tlahuelilpan and the nearby refinery. Prosecutors will be investigating the incident. Fuel theft, known locally as ""huachicoleo"" (or moonshining) is rampant in some Mexican communities. The government has said the practice cost the country about $3bn (Â£2.3bn) last year. President LÃ³pez Obrador says the crackdown on fuel thieves will intensify President LÃ³pez Obrador, who took office in December, has launched a major crackdown. Thousands of marines have been deployed to guard pipelines, some of which have been shut down altogether in places. The policy has led to increased reliance on tanker deliveries and there have been widespread reports of long lines at petrol stations. After the blast, Mr Fayad issued a plea on Twitter to try to avoid further disasters. ""I urge the entire population not to be complicit in fuel theft,""Mr Fayad posted (in Spanish),external. ""Apart from being illegal, it puts your life and those of your families at risk. What happened today in Tlahuelilpan should not be repeated."" President LÃ³pez Obrador vowed to press on with his anti-theft policy until it was eradicated. ""Rather than stopping the strategy, the fight against the illegality and theft of fuel, it will be strengthened,"" he told reporters. Pemex has suffered a number of other deadly accidents in the past. At least 37 people were killed in an explosion at its Mexico City headquarters in 2013 and another 26 died in a fire at a gas facility in 2012. Mexico blast kills and injures dozens.

"Security guard Tudor Simionov was photographed hours before he was killed Two ""dangerous individuals"" wanted in connection with the fatal stabbing of a security guard at a party in London's West End on New Year's Eve are being hunted by police. Tudor Simionov, 33, was attacked as he tried to stop gatecrashers getting into a party at Fountain House in Park Lane in the early hours of 1 January. The Met Police wants to trace Ossama Hamed, 25, and Nor Aden Hamada, 23. A woman has been charged with perverting the course of justice. Det Insp Garry Moncrieff, from the Homicide and Major Crime Command, said: ""Ossama Hamed and Nor Aden Hamada are dangerous individuals who need to be apprehended. ""I am not willing to speculate on where they may be but rest assured we are working with colleagues to ensure that if they are in this country, or overseas, we will track them down."" Anyone who sees Ossama Hamed, left, and Nor Hamada should dial 999 immediately, police said Two of Mr Simionov's colleagues, aged 29 and 37, were also stabbed during an altercation, as was a 29-year-old woman. All have since been released from hospital, police said. Shaymaa Lamrani, 26, of Northolt, was charged on Friday with perverting the course of justice, the Met said. She will appear at magistrates court later. A man has also been charged with firearms offences in relation to an incident at Fountain House which happened within minutes of the killing. The son of the banned radical cleric Abu Hamza,Imran Mostafa Kamel, was charged with possession of a firearmwith intent to cause fear or danger, and possession of a firearm when prohibited for life. He is next due to appear at court on 31 January. Police said the incident was not related to Mr Simionov's stabbing.

"High street retailer Superdrug is to introduce tougher mental health checks before performing cosmetic procedures, following criticism by the NHS. Prof Stephen Powis, the medical director of NHS England, said the injections risked fuelling mental health disorders - and the health service was left to pick up the pieces. Superdrug started offering Botox and dermal fillers last year. The retailer said it was ""fully committed"" to the issue. Botox is an injection of Botulinum toxin that relaxes muscles to temporarily hide lines and wrinkles Dermal fillers are injections under the skin that can fill skin creases or lead to bigger lips NHS Choices:Botox,externalandDermal fillers,external Superdrug's Skin Renew Service offers the cosmetic procedures to people over the age of 25,  surgeons have criticised the company for treating Botox and fillers as ""casual beauty treatments""on a par with having a wax. The NHS is concerned about the impact on people who are mentally ill, including with Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD), in which people are fixated on what they think are flaws in their appearance. The BDD Foundation says body dysmorphia can be a crippling illness and severely impair someone's life. Woman's Botox party warning after lip filler swelling Prof Powis wrote to Superdrug's chief executive, saying the company could do more to protect people who were seeking treatment because they were mentally unwell, or might have a mental health disorder triggered by treatment. Prof Powis said: ""Pressures on young people's mental health are greater than they ever have been, with families and the health service too often left to pick up the pieces. ""The lack of tough checks on cosmetic surgery means that the public is dependent on businesses taking voluntary steps to get their house in order, leaving people avoidably exposed to dangerous practices."" Superdrug said it already performs an hour-long consultation before cosmetic procedures take place and these include a mental health assessment. The company said it would now ask specific questions about Body Dysmorphic Disorder: ""We remain fully committed to including recommended protections for mental health. We met with the NHS to ensure we have the highest safety standards and quality of patient care."" Alana, who has BDD, told Radio 4's Today programme that prior to being treated for the condition she would ""beg and plead"" with her parents to access plastic surgery and cosmetic procedures. The 22-year-old believes that it would have been a ""real issue"" for her if these procedures had been available on the high street at the time. Kitty Wallace, a trustee with the BDD Foundation, said fewer than 10% of patients with BDD were satisfied with the results of their cosmetic procedures. She said: ""It is important that these measures are in place to protect such individuals from potentially damaging and unnecessary procedures. ""Although their anxiety might reduce temporarily, they will often find themselves fixating on another part of their body that they want to change. ""We commend that Superdrug will be screening for the disorder, and referring people who are positive to their GP and Mind."" The foundation has its own questionnaire, which asks questions about how much people fixate on their appearance and how much it affects their day-to-day life.

"Skengdo and AM were sentenced to nine months in jail suspended for two years Two rappers have been given suspended sentences for performing drill music which incited violence against rival gang members. Skengdo, real name Terrell Doyley, and AM, real name Joshua Malinga, pleaded guilty to breaching a gang injunction at Croydon County Court, police say. The injunction was made against the pair last year because they were members of a gang in south London. They were sentenced to nine months in jail suspended for two years. The Metropolitan Police says Skengdo and AM, both 21, breached an interim gang injunction which was made in August last year. ""It was breached when they performed drill music that incited and encouraged violence against rival gang members and then posted it on social media,""it said in a statement,external. Their manager TK told the Press Association the musicians were not involved in gang violence. He said they pleaded guilty after a video of one of their live performances was uploaded to the internet without their knowledge. The Met's top officer Cressida Dick previously linked drill music to an increase in violence in London The interim injunction was made against the rappers because they were members of a gang in Lambeth, south London - and were linked to rising violence in the borough,police said on Friday,external. The injunction was brought into full force during hearings held on 10 and 14 January. It will last for two years. Detective Inspector Luke Williams, of Lambeth and Southwark's Gangs Unit, said: ""I am pleased with the sentences passed in these cases which reflect that the police and courts are unwilling to accept behaviour leading to serious violence. ""The court found that violence in drill music can, and did in this case, amount to gang-related violence."" 1Xtra to carry on playing drill music Using drill to turn lives around Drill music video stopped by armed police TK, the director of Finesse Foreva, said the last time either of the rappers ""might have had a run-ins with the law was when they were 16 and 17"". He said at a hearing in January, police had tried to link Skengdo and AM to the history of crime in Brixton - which is in the Lambeth borough. ""They didn't find nothing on them in terms of violence because they don't have nothing on them."" He added: ""Why the Met's probably done that is because they want to affect their lives, scare big venue owners off."" Skengdo and AM have performed at Reading and Leeds festivals and have appeared on 1Xtra. They performed on Kenny Allstar's 1Xtra show on 11 January - he described them as ""one of the hottest duos in UK drill music"".

"Car insurance costs are climbing for the first time since 2017, partly because of Brexit uncertainty, according to the AA. Over the last three months, the cost of a fully comprehensive policy climbed 2.7% to Â£609.93 on average. Premiums have also climbed because an expected cut in claims costs won't now take effect until April 2020. ""But underlying all of this are concerns surrounding Brexit,"" said AA's director of insurance Janet Connor. She said: ""Regardless of what the final deal looks like, the market has continued to battle with the value of sterling. ""This has led to the rising cost of imported car parts, further adding costs to the car repair industry which ultimately finds its way to the premiums we pay."" Another key factor is the Civil Liabilities Bill - which limits the cost of whiplash. That was expected to take effect when the Bill became law last month, but will not now come into force for more than a year. ""Although the Civil Liabilities Bill has now been ratified, delaying the new provisions until April 2020 has meant that recent premium reductions in expectation that claims cost savings along with upward adjustment of the discount rate were premature, explained Ms Connor. The AA survey echoes similar figures published earlier this month by MoneySupermarket which showed that premiums had hit their highest level since January 2017. The website's editor-in-chief Tom Flack said: ""It is often more expensive to buy insurance in December as there are more cars needing it so insurers don't have to compete as hard for business. ""That means it's harder to tell if the rise in the final quarter of 2018 signals a long-term rise or is just a blip."" Customers' solutions for lower premiums Insurer 'made money from my loyalty' Consumer loyalty 'rip off' faces probe The AA warned that younger drivers are feeling the biggest pinch having to face paying premiums averaging Â£1,317. Ms Connor said: ""Young and newly qualified drivers face a significant penalty when it comes to insurance pricing, not least because they have not built up a no-claim bonus. ""So it is no surprise that some take the risk of driving without insurance."" She said the Motor Insurers' Bureau (MIB) issues some 3,000 insurance advisory warning letters to uninsured drivers every day. Black boxes are usually fitted behind the dashboard John Blevins, pricing expert at Consumer Intelligence, said black box policies - which use technology known as telematics - are the best way to keep premiums down. He said: ""Average premiums are edging up with prices rising fastest for the over-50s. ""Telematics is making a major contribution to keeping prices under control in particularly for the under-25s who benefit from personalised pricing based on their good driving behaviour. ""If older age drivers want to take more control over premiums and to avoid broad-brush price rises based on their age, they should take a look at telematics."" The AA has called for new drivers using telematics to be exempt from Insurance Premium Tax (IPT) to help cut the cost of policies. ""Telematics policies track driver behaviour and premiums reflect the driving standard of individuals,"" Ms Connor said. The number of claims made by drivers with telematics boxes in their cars is up to a third less than those without, according to the AA. ""Not only would a cut in IPT for young drivers using telematic policies discourage uninsured driving, it would also improve road safety for everyone,"" she said.

"This video can not be played Suspected fuel thieves have been blamed for rupturing the pipeline Mexican authorities now say at least 79 people were killed in Friday night's fuel pipeline blast. It is believed the explosion occurred after the line was ruptured by suspected fuel thieves in the town of Tlahuelilpan, in Hidalgo state. Officials say scores of people had been scrambling to fill up containers and were engulfed in an inferno. Dozens of charred bodies remain at the scene, which is cordoned off by security forces. Hidalgo state governor Omar Fayad said74 people had been hospitalised after the blast.,external Locals said President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador's new policy to crack down on fuel theft had created shortages. Why are there fuel shortages in Mexico? ""Everyone came to see if they could get a bit of gasoline for their car,"" farmer Isaias GarcÃ­a told Reuters news agency. ""There isn't any in petrol stations."" Relatives gather at the scene as forensic workers carry out inspections Distraught relatives have continued to gather at site of the explosion. Forensic experts have been photographing remains amid a backdrop of burned clothing and discarded fuel buckets. A few litres of fuel are worth more than the daily minimum wage in Mexico. Pemex, Mexico's state-owned petroleum company, said the fire had been caused by illegal tapping. It is believed thieves drilled through the Tula-Tuxpan pipeline - just a few miles away from a large refinery - causing a large jet of gasoline to rise into the air. Mexican officials say up to 800 people, seeing the gasoline geyser, then flocked around it to fill up containers. It erupted into flame a couple of hours later. At a press conference, Pemex chief executive Octavio Romero said the firm had been aware of a leak along the pipeline at 16:50 local time. Mr Romero said a valve had been closed to stem the leak, but he did not say what time it was shut. The pipeline has been closed since late December because of repeated hits by gangs. Since reopening on 16 January, it has been targeted four more times, according to Pemex. Some locals criticised security forces at the scene for not warning people more forcibly to get away from the leaking fuel. But President LÃ³pez Obrador defended the army against criticism, saying only 25 soldiers were present and villagers ignored warnings not to get close. He also avoided criticising the people, saying if they had to resort to ""extremes"" by stealing fuel ""it's because they were abandoned"". President LÃ³pez Obrador added that, even if the pipeline had been sealed immediately after the leak, 10,000 barrels-worth of gasoline would have still been trapped in the section of pipeline between Tlahuelilpan and the nearby refinery. Prosecutors will be investigating the incident. Fuel theft, known locally as ""huachicoleo"" (or moonshining) is rampant in some Mexican communities. The government has said the practice cost the country about $3bn (Â£2.3bn) last year. President LÃ³pez Obrador says the crackdown on fuel thieves will intensify President LÃ³pez Obrador, who took office in December, has launched a major crackdown. Thousands of marines have been deployed to guard pipelines, some of which have been shut down altogether in places. The policy has led to increased reliance on tanker deliveries and there have been widespread reports of long lines at petrol stations. After the blast, Mr Fayad issued a plea on Twitter to try to avoid further disasters. ""I urge the entire population not to be complicit in fuel theft,""Mr Fayad posted (in Spanish),external. ""Apart from being illegal, it puts your life and those of your families at risk. What happened today in Tlahuelilpan should not be repeated."" President LÃ³pez Obrador vowed to press on with his anti-theft policy until it was eradicated. ""Rather than stopping the strategy, the fight against the illegality and theft of fuel, it will be strengthened,"" he told reporters.

The statement did not say which parts of the BuzzFeed report were inaccurate. It is extremely rare for Mr Mueller's office to issue such a statement. The special counsel is investigating alleged Russian interference in the US presidential election and whether Trump campaign figures were complicit - a claim repeatedly denied by Mr Trump. Buzzfeed said its report was based on testimony from two unnamed law enforcement officials,externalinvestigating the matter. Cohen told Congress that talks over the Trump Tower plan had taken place between September 2015 and January 2016, when the project was scrapped.

Quoting the officials, Buzzfeed said Cohen told the special counsel that after the November 2016 elections, Mr Trump ""personally instructed him to lie"" - by claiming that negotiations ended months earlier than they actually did - ""in order to obscure Trump's involvement"". Mr Mueller had already revealed that Cohen lied about the date the Moscow Trump Tower project ended. The Trump-Russia saga in 250 words Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? Five big things Mueller is looking at The Buzzfeed report also said Mr Trump had allegedly encouraged Cohen to plan a trip to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin during the election campaign. Cohen was sentenced to 36 months in jail in December after he pleaded guilty to lying to Congress over the Trump Tower plan. He also admitted campaign finance violations and tax evasion. In court he said his ""weakness was a blind loyalty to Donald Trump"" - whose ""dirty deeds"" he had felt compelled to cover up. Responding to the allegations in the report, Mr Trump said that Cohen was ""lying to reduce his jail time"". He then posted a tweet late on Friday questioning Buzzfeed's editorial judgment, referring to the website's decision to publisha dossier in 2017 that alleged collusion between his election team and Russia. ""Remember it was Buzzfeed that released the totally discredited ""Dossier,"" paid for by Crooked Hillary Clinton and the Democrats,"" he wrote in a Twitter post. Allow Twitter content?

"Emma-Jayne Magson, 25, is serving a life sentence for murder Emma-Jayne Magson stabbed her partner with a steak knife then left him to bleed to death. Yet her family believes her murder conviction was a miscarriage of justice. Why? ""I've done what my Dad did to you."" Joanne Smith felt her heart sink as she read the text message from her daughter Emma-Jayne Magson. Two decades earlier Joanne had been stabbed by her partner, and now Emma had fatally stabbed her own partner, 26-year-old James Knight. Emma and James had both been out drinking that night and were thrown out of a taxi because they were rowing. The argument continued in the street and back at Emma's home. At some point Emma picked up a steak knife and plunged it into James's chest, puncturing his heart. James then somehow ended up in the street outside his brother's house, where Emma was seen sitting on top of him. When James's brother and a neighbour tried to help she failed to say she had stabbed him, so they unwittingly left him to die. Despite all of this, Justice for Women, an organisation helping 25-year-old Emma, believes she is one of many women who may have been wrongly convicted of murder after fighting back against abusive partners. The organisation is the same onehelping Sally Challen appeal against a murder convictionfor bludgeoning her ""controlling"" husband to death with a hammer. ""If I honestly thought hand on heart Emma really meant to do that [kill James], I would never stand by Emma,"" says her mother. ""But I just know Emma. I know she loves James. And that's so frustrating for me because I know how much she loves him; even to this day she loves him."" So how did Emma come to kill James Knight? Emma's older sister, Charlotte, was kept at the family home after she died Emma was only eight months old when her father attacked her mother in front of her and her older sister, Charlotte, in 1993. ""He locked me in a flat and stabbed me,"" recalls Joanne. ""They were both in my arms. He went for my throat but as I ran he slashed my legs."" Despite Emma being too young to remember what happened, Joanne says the stabbing had a lasting impact on her. ""We moved around, we went into a safe house,"" says Joanne. ""There were scars on my legs and I had to learn to walk again."" Joanne says Emma had a close relationship with her older sister. ""It was just them,"" says Joanne. ""They had a bedroom together; they did everything together."" Then Charlotte died, aged nine, following a complication from an operation. Joanne sounds regretful when explaining what she did next - her grief-stricken decision to bring Charlotte's body back to the family home for two weeks. Emma was seven years old at the time. ""Charlotte was in my bedroom for a week, in my bed,"" says Joanne. ""For the first week she was in my room then I brought her downstairs in an open casket. ""I don't think I considered anybody but myself."" Joanne said her daughter started ""acting out"" for attention as a teenager While Emma had been quiet as a child she started rebelling as a teenager. ""As she got to about 13 she started drinking, acting out really, mainly for attention,"" says Joanne. Joanne had left Emma's father but says there was violence in a subsequent relationship, and the pattern repeated when Emma got into relationships herself. One of Emma's partners ""fractured her skull and put her in hospital and she had a leak on the brain"". Emma had a daughter, who is now four years old, when she was 21. Joanne says the birth was ""traumatic"" and she suffered from post-natal depression. James Knight had two daughters from his previous relationship Emma met James a year after her daughter was born, in the autumn of 2015. They got together at about the time James's relationship ended with the mother of his two children. James had been staying with one of his brothers in Sylvan Street in Leicester, while Emma lived a few doors down with her daughter. John Skinner, who was friends with James and worked with him as a binman, described him as ""a family man"" who had lots of friends. ""James had a very good group of friends... he was popular in and amongst his mates and at work. ""Whenever he wasn't working with me people always wanted to work with him because they knew you could have a laugh and he would get the work done."" John says the relationship with Emma appeared to begin well. ""When they first got together James looked really happy and bubbly and like he was moving on with his life and he just seemed really happy and settled."" He became aware of arguments creeping in but thought this was normal for a couple getting settled. ""I've seen them have an argument once where it got quite heated but in my opinion they both gave as good as they got,"" says John. ""I've never seen either of them be violent towards each other."" Joanne felt her daughter changed as the relationship went on. ""James wanted her to stay in the home, and James didn't want her to wear makeup,"" she says. John (left) saw Emma and James argue but thought ""they both gave as good as they got"" In the murder trial, the prosecution described their relationship as ""volatile"". Emma's family claim James was physically and emotionally abusive. She ""always had bruises"", her mother says, but would explain them away as ""play fighting"". James's mother, Trish Knight, maintains her son was not violent. ""James has no history of violence towards women,"" she says. ""James was with his previous girlfriend for nine years, who he has got two children with, and there was no violence in that relationship."" The BBC contacted James's former partner but she did not want to contribute to this piece. She told The Sun,externalhe was ""a real romantic"" at the start of the relationship and ""an amazing dad"" to their daughters. However, she discovered James was smoking cannabis and taking steroids towards the end of their relationship. ""It was a far cry from the man I fell in love with,"" she told The Sun. ""It caused row after row and no matter how much I begged him to stop, he didn't listen."" John (right) said James was popular in and outside of work James's mother still insists he would never have hit anyone. ""James could shout, and James had hit a wall. If James lost his temper he would hit a wall rather than hit somebody,"" says Trish. John noticed a physical change in his workmate. ""He did get a lot bigger, obviously, you could tell there was something going off,"" says John. ""Obviously he was always obsessed with looking good... he used to go to the gym after work. ""If you do the job and you work hard it keeps you fit in itself but he went that extra mile."" Emma already had a daughter, who is now four years old Emma miscarried their baby in the middle of March 2016. Miscarriages are known to trigger mental health problems, but Emma's family say the loss was even more traumatic because half of the baby was left inside her despite a hospital procedure intended to remove it. She then returned to hospital for a further procedure to have the remains removed. Emma telephoned her mum to say James blamed her for losing the baby. ""A nurse had to have a word with them in the hospital because he was calling her a slag, saying she was with black men, that's why she lost it,"" says Joanne. James's mum said he had been ""thrilled"" about the prospect of becoming a father again, and she never heard him blame Emma for the miscarriage. ""He was upset,"" Trish says. ""I think he was angry it had happened to them."" Emma claimed she ""didn't mean to harm"" James Emma decided to go on a night out with a friend on Saturday 26 March 2016, the Easter bank holiday weekend. That night, Emma met up with James at a bar in Leicester city centre. Louise Bullivant, her new solicitor, says door staff at the pub asked James to leave because they were concerned about his behaviour. ""There was an incident between James and door staff which resulted in him being asked to leave and Emma decided to leave with him,"" she says. ""There's no doubt that they had both been drinking."" They argued in a taxi and the driver asked them to get out, meaning they had to walk home. During the journey, CCTV captured James grabbing Emma around her shoulder and neck and pushing her to the ground. A statement from Emma was read out in court, in which she claimed she stabbed James in self-defence. ""Once in the kitchen, he grabbed me around my throat and pushed me back,"" it said. ""I was right next to the sink and reached out to grab something. I picked up the first thing which came to hand which was a steak knife; the knife was in my hand and I hit out once. ""I didn't mean to harm him, I just wanted to get him off'."" ""I think something triggered; I think she had had enough,"" says Joanne. James's mum says nobody really knows what happened. ""There were only two people who were there that night and one of them can't give his version of events,"" says Trish. Emma said she stabbed James in the kitchen of her house in Sylvan Street, Leicester James did not die immediately. In fact, he somehow ended up outside his brother Kevin's house a few doors away, lying face down in the street, at about 02:30. Kevin and a neighbour, Michal Ladic, came out to help but Emma did not tell either of them she had stabbed James. ""He was still alive when I came to them,"" says Michal. ""I wanted to turn him around but she was sitting on him. He was face down, topless, she was sitting on him. ""I asked if he was all right and she said he was just drunk."" In his evidence at the trial, Kevin said Emma told him James was drunk and had been beaten up by bouncers earlier on. When asked what impression he got from Emma, Kevin said: ""That everything will be fine in the morning - he just needs to sleep it off."" Kevin helped lift James into Emma's house and placed him on the floor of the front room. Kevin did not realise his brother had been stabbed and left, telling him: ""I will see you tomorrow."" 'My mum killed my dad but I want her freed' Why doesn't prison work for women? Is it time for Scotland to stop jailing so many women? Emma rang 999 and asked for an ambulance, but again did not mention James had been stabbed. When asked what had happened she said: ""Um, I don't know, my boyfriend's here and he's making weird noises. I don't know what's going on."" Later in the call she said: ""It looks like he's had a fight with someone."" When the operator explained the ambulance might take a while, she replied: ""No, that's fine, don't worry about it."" The prosecution claimed Emma deceived people into not saving James's life, and described her as ""cold, brutal and manipulative"". However, her mother believes she simply didn't realise James was dying. ""I don't think she knew how serious it was in that moment,"" says Joanne. James was known as ""King James"" and Emma got a tattoo in tribute to him after his death Kevin was awoken by Emma banging on his door, screaming that James was dead, about 40 minutes after he had seen them both outside his house. Kevin went to Emma's house and Michal was already there trying to save his life, having heard Emma's screams. ""We didn't know he had been stabbed,"" says Michal. ""The body was so clean, nothing on him, and only when I gave him mouth-to-mouth and the second breath raised his chest and that wound opened and my eyes popped out. I just took the phone from Kev and told the operator that he was stabbed in the heart. ""Then I was trying to do the CPR for another 15 minutes and she was getting in my way, like 'I want him back, I just want him to wake up'. ""I remember telling Kev to drag her off him, and he did it, he took her off so I could carry on with the mouth-to-mouth and CPR."" Emma's grandmother says she saw marks around Emma's neck Emma phoned her grandmother, who got a taxi straight there. ""The ambulance had taken James away,"" says Lynda Allen. ""There were police everywhere. Eventually, they let me go through and she walked down the road to me. All she had got on was a little nightdress, no shoes, nothing. ""She put her head on my shoulder, crying."" Lynda noticed marks around her neck, which were also noted when Emma was later examined in police custody. Emma was not initially arrested as police did not realise she was responsible for stabbing James. She was allowed to go to her mother's house, where she told her mother she thought she had killed James, who told police. Emma was then arrested and taken away after being allowed to say goodbye to her daughter. Emma decided not to give evidence at her trial Unusually for someone accused of murder, Emma remained on bail throughout her trial at Leicester Crown Court. Her new solicitor believes this ""says a great deal about the court's approach to the evidence"". Emma decided not to give evidence herself, but her legal team argued she had acted in self-defence, did not intend to kill or harm James, and had suffered a loss of control. Her family believe she was scared and did not understand what was happening during the trial. ""How can I put it without sounding nasty?"" says her grandmother. ""Emma's very slow on the uptake. If you said something to Emma and she didn't understand it, where it's quite simple to me and you, I would have to sit and explain everything to her. ""I don't understand the law but I would have thought there would be somebody there to talk things through with her that she didn't understand."" Emma's new solicitor believes if she had been supported by an intermediary, such as a trained social worker, she might have followed the trial better and participated effectively. Emma was found guilty of murder in November 2016 and given a life sentence with a minimum term of 17 years. Joanne takes Emma's daughter to visit her in prison every week After the trial ended, Emma's mother was approached by a police officer who told her to contact Justice for Women. The group helped Emma get a new legal team, which is trying to appeal against the murder conviction using psychiatric evidence. The original psychiatrist instructed by the defence team had diagnosed Emma as having an emotionally unstable personality disorder (EUPD), but for some reason this was not used as evidence at her trial. Emma's new legal team went back to this psychiatrist for a further assessment, and also instructed a clinical psychologist who diagnosed Emma as having a pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS). Even the psychiatric expert originally instructed by the prosecution now agrees that Emma was suffering from a recognised medical condition at the time of the killing. ""He says he has revised his view and now supports a diagnosis of EUPD and PDD-NOS,"" says Emma's solicitor. A petition was launched demanding ""justice for James"", saying that Emma should stay in prison and ""do her time"". However, Court of Appeal judges in London have found Emma has an ""arguable"" case and granted permission to appeal. Emma speaks to her young daughter on the phone every day, and she visits the prison every week. ""They are so close,"" says Joanne. ""She's going to see her mum today and she said 'I'm going to my mum's house, I can't wait. I love my mum's house'. ""It's just so sad."" Trish says her son James had no history of abuse in his relationships For James's young daughters, their weekly visits are to his grave. ""They ask if Daddy is watching them,"" says Trish. ""One of his daughters when she's old enough wants to go in the sky to see Daddy."" Joanne empathises with James's mum, but maintains Emma should not have been convicted of murder. ""I've lost a child so I know what James's mum is going through. I understand, I really do,"" she says. ""I just hope Emma can come out and be a mum to her daughter and get on with her life. ""She will never forget James ever, she won't. I know that she loves James and I know that if she could take that night back she would. 100% she would."" On 22 November the Court of Appeal granted permission for Emma-Jayne Magson to appeal against her murder conviction. Her legal team is waiting for a date for the next hearing.

Quoting the officials, Buzzfeed said Cohen told the special counsel that after the November 2016 elections, Mr Trump ""personally instructed him to lie"" - by claiming that negotiations ended months earlier than they actually did - ""in order to obscure Trump's involvement"". Mr Mueller had already revealed that Cohen lied about the date the Moscow Trump Tower project ended. The Trump-Russia saga in 250 words Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? Five big things Mueller is looking at The Buzzfeed report also said Mr Trump had allegedly encouraged Cohen to plan a trip to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin during the election campaign. Cohen was sentenced to 36 months in jail in December after he pleaded guilty to lying to Congress over the Trump Tower plan. He also admitted campaign finance violations and tax evasion. In court he said his ""weakness was a blind loyalty to Donald Trump"" - whose ""dirty deeds"" he had felt compelled to cover up. Responding to the allegations in the report, Mr Trump said that Cohen was ""lying to reduce his jail time"". He then posted a tweet late on Friday questioning Buzzfeed's editorial judgment, referring to the website's decision to publisha dossier in 2017 that alleged collusion between his election team and Russia. ""Remember it was Buzzfeed that released the totally discredited ""Dossier,"" paid for by Crooked Hillary Clinton and the Democrats,"" he wrote in a Twitter post. Allow Twitter content?

"Security guard Tudor Simionov was photographed hours before he was killed Two ""dangerous individuals"" wanted in connection with the fatal stabbing of a security guard at a party in London's West End on New Year's Eve are being hunted by police. Tudor Simionov, 33, was attacked as he tried to stop gatecrashers getting into a party at Fountain House in Park Lane in the early hours of 1 January. The Met Police wants to trace Ossama Hamed, 25, and Nor Aden Hamada, 23. A woman has been charged with perverting the course of justice. Det Insp Garry Moncrieff, from the Homicide and Major Crime Command, said: ""Ossama Hamed and Nor Aden Hamada are dangerous individuals who need to be apprehended. ""I am not willing to speculate on where they may be but rest assured we are working with colleagues to ensure that if they are in this country, or overseas, we will track them down."" Anyone who sees Ossama Hamed, left, and Nor Hamada should dial 999 immediately, police said Two of Mr Simionov's colleagues, aged 29 and 37, were also stabbed during an altercation, as was a 29-year-old woman. All have since been released from hospital, police said. Shaymaa Lamrani, 26, of Northolt, was charged on Friday with perverting the course of justice, the Met said. She will appear at magistrates court later. A man has also been charged with firearms offences in relation to an incident at Fountain House which happened within minutes of the killing. The son of the banned radical cleric Abu Hamza,Imran Mostafa Kamel, was charged with possession of a firearmwith intent to cause fear or danger, and possession of a firearm when prohibited for life.

"This video can not be played Suspected fuel thieves have been blamed for rupturing the pipeline Mexican authorities now say at least 79 people were killed in Friday night's fuel pipeline blast. It is believed the explosion occurred after the line was ruptured by suspected fuel thieves in the town of Tlahuelilpan, in Hidalgo state. Officials say scores of people had been scrambling to fill up containers and were engulfed in an inferno. Dozens of charred bodies remain at the scene, which is cordoned off by security forces. Hidalgo state governor Omar Fayad said74 people had been hospitalised after the blast.,external Locals said President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador's new policy to crack down on fuel theft had created shortages. Why are there fuel shortages in Mexico? ""Everyone came to see if they could get a bit of gasoline for their car,"" farmer Isaias GarcÃ­a told Reuters news agency. ""There isn't any in petrol stations."" Relatives gather at the scene as forensic workers carry out inspections Distraught relatives have continued to gather at site of the explosion. Forensic experts have been photographing remains amid a backdrop of burned clothing and discarded fuel buckets. A few litres of fuel are worth more than the daily minimum wage in Mexico. Pemex, Mexico's state-owned petroleum company, said the fire had been caused by illegal tapping. It is believed thieves drilled through the Tula-Tuxpan pipeline - just a few miles away from a large refinery - causing a large jet of gasoline to rise into the air. Mexican officials say up to 800 people, seeing the gasoline geyser, then flocked around it to fill up containers. It erupted into flame a couple of hours later. At a press conference, Pemex chief executive Octavio Romero said the firm had been aware of a leak along the pipeline at 16:50 local time. Mr Romero said a valve had been closed to stem the leak, but he did not say what time it was shut. The pipeline has been closed since late December because of repeated hits by gangs. Since reopening on 16 January, it has been targeted four more times, according to Pemex. Some locals criticised security forces at the scene for not warning people more forcibly to get away from the leaking fuel. But President LÃ³pez Obrador defended the army against criticism, saying only 25 soldiers were present and villagers ignored warnings not to get close. He also avoided criticising the people, saying if they had to resort to ""extremes"" by stealing fuel ""it's because they were abandoned"". President LÃ³pez Obrador added that, even if the pipeline had been sealed immediately after the leak, 10,000 barrels-worth of gasoline would have still been trapped in the section of pipeline between Tlahuelilpan and the nearby refinery. Prosecutors will be investigating the incident. Fuel theft, known locally as ""huachicoleo"" (or moonshining) is rampant in some Mexican communities. The government has said the practice cost the country about $3bn (Â£2.3bn) last year. President LÃ³pez Obrador says the crackdown on fuel thieves will intensify President LÃ³pez Obrador, who took office in December, has launched a major crackdown. Thousands of marines have been deployed to guard pipelines, some of which have been shut down altogether in places. The policy has led to increased reliance on tanker deliveries and there have been widespread reports of long lines at petrol stations. After the blast, Mr Fayad issued a plea on Twitter to try to avoid further disasters. ""I urge the entire population not to be complicit in fuel theft,""Mr Fayad posted (in Spanish),external. ""Apart from being illegal, it puts your life and those of your families at risk. What happened today in Tlahuelilpan should not be repeated."" President LÃ³pez Obrador vowed to press on with his anti-theft policy until it was eradicated. ""Rather than stopping the strategy, the fight against the illegality and theft of fuel, it will be strengthened,"" he told reporters. Pemex has suffered a number of other deadly accidents in the past. At least 37 people were killed in an explosion at its Mexico City headquarters in 2013 and another 26 died in a fire at a gas facility in 2012. Mexico blast kills and injures dozens.

"Rezvan Habibimarand and Mozaffar Saberi A lawyer for an elderly Iranian couple fighting removal from the UK has said they face spending ""living the rest of their days without their family"". Mozaffar Saberi, 83, and Rezvan Habibimarand, 73, bought their Edinburgh flat in the late 1970s. While they have lived in the city on and off for 40 years, they never sought UK citizenship. Their legal team claim the couple should be allowed to remain on human rights grounds. They argue that they depend on support from nearby family and also play an important role caring for their severely autistic grandson. The Home Office has said they have no right to remain. Their final appeal against removal is due on 25 February. Since April 2000, Mr Saberi and Ms Habibimarand have held several visitors visas. However, with their own health deteriorating and their desire to watch their 11 grandchildren grow up, they made a human rights application to stay in the UK in April 2013. Rezvan Habibimarand and Mozaffar Saberi (seventh and eighth from right) and son Navid Saberi (second from left) at a family wedding It came less than a year after immigration rules were tightened by then Home Secretary Theresa May. Two human rights applications have been refused by the Home Office. The couple's son Navid Saberi told BBC Scotland: ""We are not coping very well. It is shocking the level of hostility we get from Home Office - you are treated not like a human, and like a number."" A Home Office spokeswoman said: ""All UK visa applications are considered on their individual merits, on the basis of the evidence available and in line with UK immigration rules."" Prior to 2012 the couple could have applied to stay under the adult dependant relative rule, which was tightened to reduce ""net migration"". John Vassiliou, a partner at McGill & Co Solicitors who are handling their case, said it has become ""impossible"" for anyone to bring parents into the UK permanently. He said: ""The criteria that have to be satisfied are so severe that I have yet to meet anyone who has been able to meet them. ""And there are difficulties with visiting Iran, you can't just pop over on holiday. ""Mozaffar and Rezvan would struggle greatly - they would have to live out their lives without their children and grandchildren, who are all British citizens. ""They're showing normal things for people their age - frailty, reduced mobility, they take various medications. They do rely heavily on their children, but they still play a very important part in their children's lives on an emotional level. ""A 70 and 80-year-old living out the rest of their days there without their family is really sad."" He said the couple also look after their non-verbal teenage grandson to help their daughter, who is a single parent and an NHS nurse. The boy's condition means he can only communicate using a tablet and is susceptible to high stress levels, particularly around strangers. Months before the couple's second application, a child psychology expert told the Home Office they supported Mozaffar and Rezvan staying in Scotland in a report. The psychologist concluded: ""His grandparents and their residence are essential parts of his social, psychological and physical environment."" However, the second application from October 2016 was refused - a move that prompted the couple's legal team to launch a judicial review. The Home Office conceded and reconsidered the evidence on their grandson's autism, but again refused the application. In a letter, officials questioned the couple's ability to care for their grandson when ""you both are elderly and require help yourselves"". They also suggested the boy's mother give up work and ""seek assistance from social services"". The letter concludes the couple's applications ""show total disregard for the immigration laws of the UK"". Mr Vassiliou branded the letter's contents ""galling"". On the couple's grandson, he said: ""He relies on his grandparents for emotional care. When he's with them, he's relaxed, calm and happy, and when he's without them, he is not. ""Removal would impact everyone in their family, particularly the child and his mother. I don't know if he would understand or know why his grandparents suddenly aren't there."" Mr Saberi's son added: ""They asked my sister to seek benefits and use public money which is absolutely shocking. We are all working really hard to provide care, we don't want public funds - that's our obligation and we're happy to do that.""They have an emotional connection to all of us - they have three generations here. ""The level of care we provide for them here cannot be provided for them in Iran. They are elderly, if they go back to Iran that emotional and psychological dependency, which is mutual, would not be there.""

"Secondary schools in England will be able to apply for money to take poorer pupils overseas on school exchanges The Â£2.5 million government scheme will enable pupils aged 11 and over ""to experience other cultures and go to places they wouldn't normally visit"". Education Secretary Damian Hinds said: ""As Britain leaves the EU, it's more important than ever to show how much we value international opportunities."" It is estimated the scheme could support trips for 2,900 pupils. The exchange programme will be run in partnership with the British Council,the organisation for cultural relations,external. The grants will be targeted at schools with above-average numbers of pupil-premium students. Pupil premium is a form of additional funding given to state schools in England to help ""close the gap"" between disadvantaged pupils and their peers. Research by the British Council found that only 39% of state secondary schools run exchange programmes, compared with 77% of independent schools. ""School exchanges are so valuable, bringing subjects such as modern languages and international history to life, as well as helping pupils develop into confident, independent and well-rounded young people,"" said Mr Hinds. London state school secures 41 Oxbridge offers Education spending now 'skewed' to poorer pupils Do schools help or hinder social mobility? He stressed the importance of learning other languages and developing ""a global outlook"" among young people. ""School exchanges are so valuable, bringing subjects such as modern languages and international history to life. ""This investment will help schools who may not have much experience organising trips abroad to ensure their pupils don't miss out on all the fantastic benefits these experiences can bring.""

"What does the colour of your car say about you? Half a million Britons bought a grey car last year - and in 2018, for the first time, it was the most popular car colour, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). Silver, meanwhile, had its heyday in the early 2000s, topping the chart every year between 2000 and 2008. In 2018, however, it didn't even make the top five. Silver is just metallic grey isn't it? Not in the car world it isn't. The second most popular car model sold last year, Volkswagen's Golf, comes in ""grey metallic"" and ""silver metallic"". A company spokesman explained that a lot of their colours are just translations from their German equivalent. All newly-bought cars are registered with the DVLA - and the colour is recorded according to the car manufacturer's description. However, that doesn't extend to distinguishing between cherry red and scarlet - in the DVLA's eyes they're both just red. So why the difference between metallic grey and silver? A spokesman from Nissan, which offers a ""gun metallic"" and ""blade silver"" finish to its Qashqai, said: ""Silver aims to replicate the finish of silver the metal, whereas grey is the colour grey."" Sprinter Usain Bolt helped auction off a gold Nissan in 2012 Black, white, and silver have been firm favourites since the turn of the millennium. But of the colours deemed less aesthetically pleasing, maroon was the least popular choice last year, with only 471 such cars registered. Not far behind was cream, with 559 registrations. Third most unpopular was pink - which also fell out of favour with ex-glamour model Katie Price, who triedto sell off her Barbie pink jeep,externalafterbeing banned from driving earlier this month. Fourth was turquoise with 1,824 registrations and fifth was gold, with 2,919. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

There have long been rumours that darker cars have higher insurance premiums. The thinking goes that lighter and brighter cars are easier to see and therefore less likely to get into accidents. But price comparison website MoneySupermarket said it doesn't ask customers to specify car colour. The reason? ""It's easier for a bad driver to change the colour of his car than the quality of his cornering!"" a spokesman said. If you do fancy a lick of paint though, you'll have to inform the DVLA. Lee Griffin, president of comparison site GoCompare, said various studies had looked at the correlation between car colour and accident rates. ""However, UK insurers do not take colour into account when setting premiums as the statistics are too unreliable,"" he said. ""They will focus on your age and driving history as well as the type of car that you drive, which are all better indicators of your insurance risk.""

"'They are killing us': The murder last month of schoolteacher Laura Luelmo sparked protests at violence against women A man convicted of killing his wife is now believed to have murdered his defence lawyer, with whom he had been having an affair, before taking his own life on Friday. Jose Javier Salvador Calvo, 50, jumped from a bridge in the eastern town of Teruel when police confronted him. The case has shocked Spain, prompting debate about domestic violence laws. Reacting to the deaths, Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez vowed to continue tackling violence against women. His tweet is seen as a retort to Vox,a far-right party influential in the southern region of Andalusiathat wants to halt legal aid for women beaten by men, saying it unfairly favours the woman. Jose Javier Salvador Calvo shot dead his wife, Patricia Maurel Conte, 29, in May 2003 in Spain's north-eastern region of Aragon. Released under licence in 2017, the killer began an affair with Rebeca Santamalia CÃ¡ncer, 47, the lawyer who had defended him at his trial, Spanish media report. Police found the lawyer stabbed to death at Salvador Calvo's home in Aragon's regional capital, Zaragoza, just after 04:00 (03:00 GMT) on Friday after her husband reported her missing. A few hours earlier, around midnight, the suspected murderer had jumped from a bridge in Teruel, a town 150km (93 miles) to the south, after being spotted by a police patrol. Local government representative Carmen SÃ¡nchez told reporters that the lawyer had been a victim of ""gender violence"".

"Camp beds are set up in a lounge in Crystal Palace's ground when temperatures drop below freezing A Premier League club has offered part of its stadium as an emergency shelter for rough sleepers. Crystal Palace FC will turn part of Selhurst Park in south London into a space where up to 10 homeless people can sleep when temperatures are forecast to drop below freezing. They will also be given a hot meal, breakfast and washing facilities, said Croydon Council, who helped set it up. Eight people used the emergency shelter on Thursday night. They slept on camp beds which were set up in a lounge inside the club's ground. The new emergency shelter at Selhurst Park can house up to 10 homeless people Crystal Palace chief executive Phil Alexander said the club wanted to ""be a force in the community"". ""We are delighted to be collaborating with Croydon Council and their partner agencies to ensure that rough sleepers can find an emergency shelter in the event of severe winter weather,"" he added. When Selhurst Park is unavailable due to home matches, the council said it would continue to refer rough sleepers to other emergency shelters in Croydon and in central London. The rough sleepers will also be given a hot meal, breakfast and washing facilities Councillor Alison Butler said Crystal Palace was ""setting a standard for other clubs to follow"". ""Freezing temperatures are a particular safety risk for rough sleepers and this is a wonderful gesture by Crystal Palace for helping us reduce that risk.""

"Secondary schools in England will be able to apply for money to take poorer pupils overseas on school exchanges The Â£2.5 million government scheme will enable pupils aged 11 and over ""to experience other cultures and go to places they wouldn't normally visit"". Education Secretary Damian Hinds said: ""As Britain leaves the EU, it's more important than ever to show how much we value international opportunities."" It is estimated the scheme could support trips for 2,900 pupils. The exchange programme will be run in partnership with the British Council,the organisation for cultural relations,external. The grants will be targeted at schools with above-average numbers of pupil-premium students. Pupil premium is a form of additional funding given to state schools in England to help ""close the gap"" between disadvantaged pupils and their peers. Research by the British Council found that only 39% of state secondary schools run exchange programmes, compared with 77% of independent schools. ""School exchanges are so valuable, bringing subjects such as modern languages and international history to life, as well as helping pupils develop into confident, independent and well-rounded young people,"" said Mr Hinds. London state school secures 41 Oxbridge offers Education spending now 'skewed' to poorer pupils Do schools help or hinder social mobility? He stressed the importance of learning other languages and developing ""a global outlook"" among young people. ""School exchanges are so valuable, bringing subjects such as modern languages and international history to life. ""This investment will help schools who may not have much experience organising trips abroad to ensure their pupils don't miss out on all the fantastic benefits these experiences can bring.""

"How long do you wait to see your GP? Members of theBBC NHS Health Check Facebook group,externalreport waits of three weeks or more are common. Lisa Johns said: ""Ours book five weeks ahead. For the last three weeks, I've been trying to book a standard appointment and can't get one, as they go in seconds."" Another member posted: ""I booked a non-urgent appointment with my GP last week.... for 22 January 2019."" Their experiences are backed up by statistics. Earlier this month,NHS Digital published figures,externalshowing that, while 40% of patients were seen on the day they booked, just under a fifth waited longer than a fortnight for a routine appointment with a GP or practice nurse. But what's the story behind these figures? Have waits actually got longer? The NHS Digital figures show of 307 million appointments booked at practices in England between November 2017 and October 2018: 40% were on the day 27% were within a week 14.5% were in one to two weeks 8% were in two to three weeks 5% were in three to four weeks 5% were in more than four weeks It is the first time such figures has been published - so there aren't similar figures to compare them with. But plenty of previous research has found demand on GP services has grown. And experts say they do see waits increasing. Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, head of the Royal College of GPs, said: ""This is a real problem. It's something we predicted. Unfortunately, it's the inevitable consequence of a shortage of GPs."" A 2016Lancet paper said GPs' workload had risen by 16%,externalin the seven years up to 2014, with more frequent and longer GP consultations. Is it because demands on GPs have increased? Factors including an ageing population and an increasing number of people with complex medical needs mean the standard appointment often isn't long enough. Dr Kamal Mahtani, a GP and an associate professor in primary care at the University of Oxford, said: ""You've got 10 minutes to talk about their diabetes, their high blood pressure, their mood and look at the patient more holistically. ""So a GP might end up having to say, 'We've dealt with X and Y today but I'll need to see you again.' And that has a knock-on effect. People were directed to their GP for lots of different things, he said. ""If you're not feeling well, go and see the GP. If you need a flu jab, go and see a GP - as if we're a one-stop shop."" But the RCGP said a lack of GPs was also affecting availability. ""We're now 1,000 short of the number of GPs we had when they promised 5,000 more - so now we're looking for 6,000,"" an RCGP official said. Is it safe to wait weeks for an appointment? Some patients are happy to wait. They might want to see a particular GP whom they know or someone who is familiar with their long-term health problem - it might be something that isn't going to alter over a few weeks. But there are fears that others might be at risk from waiting. Catherine Churcher, another member of the BBC NHS Health Check Facebook group, was concerned that the most vulnerable would be least able to negotiate the system and so be worst affected, ""There must be lots of people out there who are falling through the net and not being seen because they don't have the strength or fight in them to go up against the current system,"" she said. Prof Stokes-Lampard said: ""There's no hard data that shows patients are coming to harm. But that's my profound concern - that there are things that will be missed."" And Dr Mahtani said: ""How do you know if the patient's condition isn't getting worse if patients are waiting three weeks? I can't tell you that they're not suffering until I see them. ""And there's always that risk that the longer waits are causing harm."" Are all practices affected? No - but Prof Stokes-Lampard warned that even if your practice seemed OK, it was still vulnerable to events at neighbouring GPs. ""All you need is for the practice down the road to close and then patients would be moved and your practice would be under pressure,"" she said. ""There is a domino effect. And then it's phenomenally stressful for the doctors at that practice."" Is there anything that will help? GPs say patients can help - by calling in if they can't make an appointment, so it can be freed up for someone else, and by thinking whether they could get the advice they need somewhere else, such as the chemist's or dentist. There are various ideas being tried out across general practice too, experimenting with taking some of the administration away from GPs and bringing in other professions, physiotherapists and social workers, into primary care in addition to the specialist nurses that many people are already familiar with. Technology can also help - some practices have online systems where patients can book directly. But Dr Mahtani said there was no single solution - because each practice had a different mix of patients and different skills among its staff. Better funding was key though. ""If you invest in primary care, you will reduce your costs in secondary care - 90% of first contacts are in primary care,"" he said. ""We need to embrace general practice.""

Is Andy Murray going to retire before Wimbledon? Will Olivia Colman win at this year's Oscars? Does life exist on another planet? And if you're in the mood for a long night, what's next for Brexit? There's plenty to wonder about there. Britain's future is currently about as predictable as a game of blindfolded darts played by left-handed toddlers using their right arms to throw. Nobody has a clue as to what is going to happen. Politicians, commentators and pub bores all have a view they will happily share, but nobody actually knows. Which makes the subject fertile ground for novelists, whose stock-in-trade it is to let their imaginations run wild and hypothesise. Enter John Lanchester, a first-class essayist and now five-time novelist who has written The Wall, a dystopian tale set in a Britain of the near-ish future. Suffice it to say, things have not gone well. Climate change (""the Change"") has done for the country's coastline, which is now beachless and miserable and home to the eponymous Wall: a 10,000km-long, 3m-wide concrete barricade snaking around Britain's perimeter, patrolled by Defenders whose job is to keep out the Others - desperate, homeless migrants from flooded foreign parts. If an Other succeeds in breaching the heavily guarded Wall, then the Defender considered most culpable is put out to sea in a dinghy never to be seen or heard of again. It's a bit harsh, but rules are rules. The home guard of Defenders is made up of young men and women who are conscripted through a new National Service. It's a minimum two-year posting of joyless 12-hour shifts with statutory leave taken at home with parents to whom they do not speak because ""the olds"" are to blame for not only wrecking the planet, but also thoughtlessly bringing kids into a world without beaches. The book has many of the standard tropes of a dystopian novel. There is a totalitarian state operating in a bleak post-industrial landscape caused by a climatic catastrophe, creating the justification for a faceless bureaucracy to suppress and control a cowed population. Our protagonist is young Joseph Kavanagh, a new recruit to the Wall. He is about to embark on his stint as a Defender and soon discovers his working environment is grim, a ""cold, hard, unforgiving, desperate place"" in which he feels ""trapped"". The only way to reduce your stint on the Wall is to become a Breeder and have children, which might seem like a no-brainer butâ¦ ""people don't want to Breed, because the world is such a horrible place."" So that's out. Kavanagh is reasonable company. You wouldn't rush up to him at a school reunion, but he's a steady chap who might be missing a funny bone but at least is willing to engage in some Wall banter with his fellow recruits. He is not a rebellious type. Nor is he particularly scathing about the State or questioning of its questionable moral compass. For instance, it used to allow a few Others ""who showed they had valuable skills"" to stay in the country. But not any more, because doing so would escalate the numbers attempting to gain entry. A self-defeating policy, you might think, at a time when the country is so short of manpower that Kavanagh's miserable two-year stretch on the Wall might have to be extended by another 12 months. Surely our rookie conscript would be full of righteous indignation, pointing out the contradictory logic of the state: if it was successfully discouraging the Others by being mean, wouldn't that result in fewer and not more Defenders needed on the Wall? It can't have it both ways, can it Kavanagh? Come on man, sharpen up! But he doesn't. He's a trusting soul, which is always a mistake in a dystopian novel. Fortunately he's a good swimmer. John Lanchester's novel Capital became a BBC TV drama in 2015 And fortunately for us, John Lanchester is a good writer. As you will know if you've read Whoops! - his non-fiction book about the 2008 financial crisis. He is also a decent novelist. Capital, his previous book - a sort of fictionalised version of Whoops! - did well and was subsequently made into a TV series. The Wall could well end up on the telly, too. Dystopias are all the rage with producers at the moment: Black Mirror, The Handmaid's Tale, The Hunger Games etc. It would probably require a little something extra, though. The characters we meet in the book are fine as far as they go, which isn't very far in terms of personality development. They are a low-tech, rather parochial crowd, who aren't nearly as dreary as their environment, but you're unlikely to ever find them showboating in front of a table laden with Big Macs. Unlike Donald Trump, whose proposed wall is one of the many contemporary political issues Lanchester deftly alludes to in a book that owes more to One State's all-encompassing protective Green Wall in Yevgeny Zamyatin's early 1920s dystopian classic We than it does to the current US president's border project. John Lanchester The novel We inspired an entire body of so-called speculative fiction including Brave New World and Nineteen Eighty-Four. All are great works. Which The Wall isn't, quite. It is very good: a well-structured, well-paced story with a narrative drive that keeps you going through the monotony of life on the Wall. It does, though, fall a concrete slab or two short in terms of its ambition, both intellectually and imaginatively. It doesn't stretch or challenge the reader or use the future as a device to introduce any alarmingly new social concepts (beyond the idea of the devastating effects of global warming, evidence of which is already just a Google click away). In fact, I suspect if John Lanchester were to use his learned, measured, insightful mind to produce a non-fiction book about climate change, it would be a far more distressing peek into the future than his latest novel.

"This video can not be played Trump's attorney general nominee William Barr is quizzed about obstruction US President Donald Trump has hit back over a news report that he directed his then personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, to lie to Congress. Buzzfeed News said Mr Trump had instructed Cohen to lie about plans to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. Cohen was convicted over the case last month. Mr Trump said the lawyer was lying about the Moscow project to ""reduce his jail time"". The office of US Special Counsel Robert Mueller also disputed the report. A spokesman for Mr Mueller - who is investigating alleged Russian interference in the US presidential election and whether Trump campaign figures were complicit - said Buzzfeed's ""description of specific statements"" and ""characterisation of documents and testimony obtained by this office, regarding Michael Cohen's Congressional testimony are not accurate"". Democratic politicians say they will investigate Buzzfeed's allegations. Buzzfeed says its report is based on testimony from two unnamed law enforcement officials,externalinvestigating the matter. The story alleges Mr Trump received 10 personal updates from Cohen about a plan to build the Moscow tower at a time when Mr Trump denied having any business ties to Russia. Trump's tower in Moscow that never was All you need to know about Trump Russia story Seven legal headaches for the president Mr Trump's daughter, Ivanka, and son, Donald Jnr, were also updated, the story alleges. Mr Mueller has already revealed that Cohen lied about the date the Moscow Trump Tower project ended. This video can not be played What does it take to impeach a president? Cohen told Congress talks over the plan had taken place between September 2015 and January 2016 but criminal complaint documents say they lasted until June. Cohen said the plan had been halted earlier in an attempt to ""minimise links between the Moscow Project and Individual 1"" during the election campaign. Individual 1 has previously been identified by Cohen as Mr Trump. Buzzfeed says Cohen has told investigators that Mr Trump ""personally instructed him to lie"" about the date negotiations ended ""in order to obscure Trump's involvement"" The Trump-Russia saga in 250 words Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? Five big things Mueller is looking at The report said Mr Mueller had other evidence, including from interviews with other Trump organisation staff and internal company emails, to corroborate Cohen's version of events. The report also says Mr Trump allegedly encouraged Cohen to plan a trip to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin during the election campaign. Cohen was sentenced to 36 months in December after he pleaded guilty to lying to Congress over the Trump Tower plan. He also admitted campaign finance violations and tax evasion. In court he said his ""weakness was a blind loyalty to Donald Trump"" - whose ""dirty deeds"" he had felt compelled to cover up. Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News With the longest government shutdown in history poised to stretch into a fifth week, Washington has become a political powder keg. The report on Thursday night that there is documentary evidence Donald Trump directed his former attorney to lie to Congress just lit a big fuse. If the Buzzfeed story is substantiated - and it asserts this evidence is already in the hands of Mr Mueller - this would appear to present a strong case for presidential obstruction of justice. Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar, in a hearing on Tuesday, prompted attorney general nominee William Barr to acknowledge as much. Already the quiet whispers of impeachment among House Democrats are getting louder. Speaker Nancy Pelosi has been able to tamp down this sentiment so far, but she may be unable - or unwilling - to keep it under wraps much longer. For almost two years, Mr Mueller's Russia investigation has been a cipher, with details of its activities coming only in opaque legal filings and anonymous accounts of unascertainable veracity. It seems the time for him to put his cards on the table and end the speculation and parlour-game guessing is rapidly approaching. In fact it's past time, if you ask some Democrats. The intelligence committee of the House of Representatives will investigate the claims, says its new chairman, Adam Schiff.He said the allegations against Mr Trump,externalwere ""among the most serious to date"". The head of the House judiciary committee, Jerrold Nadler, said it would also work to ""get to the bottom"" of the case. Some Democrats reacted by calling for impeachment. This video can not be played How the jailing of Cohen affects Trump Representative Ted Lieu tweeted,externalthat the story established a ""clear case of Obstruction of Justice, a felony"". Representative for Texas Joaquin Castro,externalsaid that if the story were true ""President Trump must resign or be impeached"". The president's response on Twitter,externalmainly retweeted a Fox News reporter's comment that Cohen had been ""convicted of perjury and fraud"", though the president added ""Lying to reduce his jail time!"" The president's current personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, issued a statement on Friday saying that ""any suggestion from any source that the president counselled Michael Cohen to lie is categorically false"". Earlier, Mr Giuliani told the Washington Post,external: ""If you believe Cohen, I can get you a great deal on the Brooklyn Bridge."" White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley told Fox News it was ""ludicrous"" to give credibility to Buzzfeed, saying its ""uncorroborated"" story was the kind of fake news the president and his team had to deal with daily. He said that Cohen had been ""proven to be a liar"". Mr Mueller's investigation is still ongoing and it is unclear when he will submit his findings to the attorney general. It is up to the attorney general to notify Congress and decide whether the report will be released publicly. Memo reveals Cohen's help on Russia probe Michael Cohen: Trump's personal lawyer What does the special counsel do? President Trump's nominee for attorney general, William Barr, is currently undergoing confirmation in Congress. He has said he will make as much of the Mueller report public as possible but has not promised to publish it all. Cohen was sentenced in New York last month So far Mr Mueller's investigation has led to charges against more than two dozen Russians, as well as several people connected to Mr Trump himself, including his former national security adviser and the former chairman of his election campaign. A number of them, including Cohen, are known to be co-operating with Mr Mueller's inquiry. How could the president be impeached? How will history judge President Trump? Cohen's help to Russia probe revealed Cohen must report to prison by 6 March, but before that, he has agreed to testify before the House Oversight Committee in February.

"Australians have flocked to beaches and watering holes to cool off Australia has just sweltered through at least five of its 10 warmest days on record, authorities estimate. An extreme heatwave has afflicted the nation since Saturday, causing wildlife deaths, bushfires and a rise in hospital admissions. Australia's Bureau of Meteorology said preliminary readings showed daily national temperature highs of 40C (104F). The town of Noona in New South Wales hit a night-time temperature of 35.9C. It was the highest minimum temperature ever recorded anywhere in Australia, the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) said.,external Temperatures on Friday will soar above 42C in ""broad areas"", the Bureau predicted. Why Australia's extreme heat might be here to stay Australia drought seen from the air Forecasters have compared conditions to the nation's worst heatwave in 2013, where the mercury soared to 39C for seven consecutive days. The hottest day on record for Australia is 7 January 2013, when the national average maximum temperature was 40.3C. A beachgoer in Sydney on Tuesday A woman cools down with her dog at Port Melbourne Beach ""The current heatwave ranks alongside that of January 2013 as the most extensive and prolonged heatwave on record over Australia,"" BOM senior meteorologist Blair Trewin told the BBC earlier this week. ""There have been other notable heatwaves but none affecting such a large area of the country."" A large swathe of New South Wales is bearing the brunt of the heat, with temperatures also soaring in parts of Queensland, South Australia, Victoria and the Northern Territory.

But meteorologists say they are then set to rise in Western Australia. Parts of the state could see temperatures up to 14 degrees higher than average in the days to come. Meteorologists say that the heatwave has broken heat records at more than 10 places around Australia, largely central inland locations.

Australians are used to high temperatures - even though the current heatwave appears to be particularly bad State authorities have issued heat stress warnings to people In coastal cities, many Australians flocked to pools, beaches and other watering holes to cool off. Some people also shared their attempts to cool down on social media, including one Reddit user who wrote that he was ""refrigerating my pyjamas to survive the stuffiness of my bedroom"". Dozens of bushfires were burning across Victoria, Tasmania and New South Wales on Thursday in conditions exacerbated by the heat and drought. At Cobar's Empire Hotel, temperatures reached 50C on Friday. ""It's very difficult but we push through,"" bar attendant Britney-Lee Fazulla told the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper. She said it was the worst heatwave she'd experienced. There were also reports of mass deaths in native bat colonies in New South Wales, and fruit orchards spoiling under the Sun.

"The UK has yet to finalise agreements to replace existing free trade deals the EU has with 40 big economies if there is a no-deal Brexit. International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said he ""hoped"" they would but it depended on whether other countries were ""willing to put the work in"". He said more deals were coming, after signing one with Australia. Concerns have been raised that the UK will leave the EU without a deal that would protect current arrangements. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March, under the Article 50 process and the UK's EU Withdrawal Act, with or without a deal - unless the UK chooses to revoke Article 50 and continues as a member of the EU. MPs defeated the withdrawal deal negotiated with the EU by a huge margin earlier this week, which provided for a ""transition period"" of 21 months, under which much of the UK's relationship with the EU would remain the same. Reality Check: Has immigration held down wages? Boles: Ministers back 'block no-deal' plan Farage seeking 'new party' for elections Top Germans plead with UK to stay in EU Where Tory tribes stand on Brexit In 2017, Mr Fox said that the UK could ""replicate the 40 free trade agreements before we leave the EU"", so that there would be no disruption to trade. But with just over two months to go until Brexit, not one has been signed, said the BBC's business correspondent Jonty Bloom. The Department for International Trade says some agreements are at an advanced stage but none of the 40 free trade deals that the EU has with other countries have so far been rolled over so that they will cover the UK after Brexit. The closest the UK has come to rolling over a free trade deal is an initial agreement with Switzerland to replicate the existing EU-Switzerland arrangements ""as far as possible"".  But that deal has not been formally signed yet. Asked abouta report in the Financial Times,externalthat Britain would not be close to finalising most of the 40 free trade deals the EU currently has with other countries, Mr Fox told the BBC: ""I hope they will be but there are not just dependent on the UK. Our side is ready. ""It's largely dependent on other whether countries believe that there will be no deal and are willing to put the work in to the preparations."" On Friday, he signed a ""mutual recognition agreement"" with the Australian high commissioner in London - to maintain all current relevant aspects of the agreement it has with the EU. The EU does not have a free trade agreement with Australia. He said there would be a ""pipeline of them to be signed as we go through"" and the agreement made it easier for UK goods to comply with Australian standards. Mr Fox also said that staying in a permanent customs arrangement with the EU would ""not be delivering Brexit"" as he did not believe it would allow the UK to pursue an independent trade policy. Some opposition parties have been making the case for a customs union. Theresa May held talks with the leaders of parties including the SNP and the Lib Dems, about a way forward after she won a confidence vote by a narrow margin in the Commons on Wednesday. She also spoke to German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte on the telephone on Thursday night, and will be speaking to more EU leaders over the weekend.

But Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn, who wants the UK to be in a permanent customs union with ""strong"" ties to the single market, has refused to take part in talks with the prime minister until she rules out the prospect of leaving the EU without a deal. In a letter to Mrs May, Mr Corbyn said her talks were ""not genuine"". He also accused her of ""sticking rigidly"" to her withdrawal agreement. As many as 20 Tory ministers have also said they would quit the government unless the prime minister allows them to try to stop a no deal Brexit,according to the Telegraph,external. Mrs May says ruling out no deal is impossible as it is not within the government's power. Writingin the Financial Times,external, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said the Conservative Party was ""riven with division"" so Labour would ""return to Parliament to promote the compromise we believe is not only in the best interests of our economy but is also capable of securing sufficient support both here and in Brussels"". This video can not be played Johnson: 'Shameful' to extend Article 50 If Parliament was at an impasse, and Labour could not get a general election ""we should also retain the option of seeking a public vote,"" he added.

On Friday a pro-referendum campaign group paid for a wrap-around advertisement in his local newspaper, theIslington Tribune,external, urging him to back a ""public vote on Brexit"". In a speech at JCB Headquarters in Rocester, Staffordshire, former foreign secretary Boris Johnson said changing the date of leaving from 29 March would be ""shameful"", and the public would view it as ""an elite conspiracy to thwart Brexit"".

"The variation in the availability of GPs in different parts of England is shocking, doctors' leaders say. A BBC analysis has found close to a threefold difference between the areas with the most and fewest doctors. In one area - Swale in Kent - there is only one GP for every 3,300 patients, while in Rushcliffe in Nottinghamshire it is just under one for every 1,200. The Royal College of GPs said the shortages put care at risk, but NHS chiefs said issues were being tackled. More doctors are being trained and community services have been made a priority for investment under the 10-year plan announced earlier this month. Millions miss out on seven-day GP access Have waits for GP appointments got longer? However, RCGP chairwoman Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard said none of that addressed the urgent problems the profession was facing. She said the differences in the number of GPs was ""shocking"" and ""surprising"". ""It suggests there are areas of the country that are really struggling to get the GPs they need. ""Over the past decade, general practice has not received the investment it needs."" She believes the health service in England is 6,000 doctors short of what it needs - it currently has just over 34,000 - and the problems meant care was ""not safe"" in some places. Patients Association chief executive Rachel Power said the findings were ""worrying"". She said as well as risking safety, shortages also meant ""increased difficulty in securing an appointment, and longer waits"". The analysis looks at the number of patients per GP in each local NHS area - known as clinical commissioning groups. It shows a threefold difference between the areas with the most GPs and least. Worst areas (patients per GP) Swale: 3,342 Horsham and Mid Sussex: 2,997 Bradford City: 2,587 Thanet: 2,520 Bexley: 2,479 Best areas (patients per GP) Rushcliffe: 1,192 Camden: 1,227 Liverpool: 1,283 North Derbyshire: 1,286 Corby: 1,369 There is no official recommendation for how many patients a GP should have. That is because the demand each patient places on their GP is different. Older patients, young children or people with long-term conditions, such as diabetes, will need to see their GPs more than others. If a doctor has a lot of these patients on their books, they will not be able to cope with as many patients. That could be behind some of the differences that are being seen, but not all, the RCGP said. The data provided by NHS Digital only goes back to 2015. In that time it shows the number of GPs being employed has fallen slightly while their patient population has increased. For the average GP this means their caseload has increased by nearly 80 patients to 1,734. NHS bosses believe that will improve in the coming years. NHS England is increasing the proportion of the budget spent on general practice in a bid to recruit 5,000 more GPs. There are signs that is beginning to have an impact. A few years ago one in 10 training places were going unfilled. But last year they were all filled - in fact extra places were opened up as 3,400 people went into training. The RCGP warned this will take some time to have an impact, given the number of years it takes to train a doctor. The college would like to see more incentives to encourage doctors to work in areas where there are shortages. In the past, ""golden hellos"" worth Â£20,000 have been used to attract GPs to some areas. A spokesman for NHS England also pointed out that there were thousands of nurses, pharmacists and other health staff working alongside GPs and, with the extra investment being made in the NHS, these staff would help ""free up extra resource for GP services in every community"".

"High street retailer Superdrug is to introduce tougher mental health checks before performing cosmetic procedures, following criticism by the NHS. Prof Stephen Powis, the medical director of NHS England, said the injections risked fuelling mental health disorders - and the health service was left to pick up the pieces. Superdrug started offering Botox and dermal fillers last year. The retailer said it was ""fully committed"" to the issue. Botox is an injection of Botulinum toxin that relaxes muscles to temporarily hide lines and wrinkles Dermal fillers are injections under the skin that can fill skin creases or lead to bigger lips NHS Choices:Botox,externalandDermal fillers,external Superdrug's Skin Renew Service offers the cosmetic procedures to people over the age of 25,  surgeons have criticised the company for treating Botox and fillers as ""casual beauty treatments""on a par with having a wax. The NHS is concerned about the impact on people who are mentally ill, including with Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD), in which people are fixated on what they think are flaws in their appearance. The BDD Foundation says body dysmorphia can be a crippling illness and severely impair someone's life. Woman's Botox party warning after lip filler swelling Prof Powis wrote to Superdrug's chief executive, saying the company could do more to protect people who were seeking treatment because they were mentally unwell, or might have a mental health disorder triggered by treatment. Prof Powis said: ""Pressures on young people's mental health are greater than they ever have been, with families and the health service too often left to pick up the pieces. ""The lack of tough checks on cosmetic surgery means that the public is dependent on businesses taking voluntary steps to get their house in order, leaving people avoidably exposed to dangerous practices."" Superdrug said it already performs an hour-long consultation before cosmetic procedures take place and these include a mental health assessment. The company said it would now ask specific questions about Body Dysmorphic Disorder: ""We remain fully committed to including recommended protections for mental health. We met with the NHS to ensure we have the highest safety standards and quality of patient care."" Alana, who has BDD, told Radio 4's Today programme that prior to being treated for the condition she would ""beg and plead"" with her parents to access plastic surgery and cosmetic procedures. The 22-year-old believes that it would have been a ""real issue"" for her if these procedures had been available on the high street at the time. Kitty Wallace, a trustee with the BDD Foundation, said fewer than 10% of patients with BDD were satisfied with the results of their cosmetic procedures. She said: ""It is important that these measures are in place to protect such individuals from potentially damaging and unnecessary procedures. ""Although their anxiety might reduce temporarily, they will often find themselves fixating on another part of their body that they want to change. ""We commend that Superdrug will be screening for the disorder, and referring people who are positive to their GP and Mind."" The foundation has its own questionnaire, which asks questions about how much people fixate on their appearance and how much it affects their day-to-day life.

"The court has heard Alfie Lamb cried out ""mummy"" when a car seat was pushed back into him A three-year-old boy who was crushed by a car seat had trauma injuries similar to those of a victim in a car crash, a court has heard. Alfie Lamb died after his mother's boyfriend allegedly reversed his seat into him during a car journey in 2018. A paediatric pathologist told the Old Bailey the toddler's death was ""unnatural"" and appeared to have been caused by an ""increase in pressure."" Adrian Hoare, 23, and Stephen Waterson, 25, both deny manslaughter. Alfie was found unresponsive as the pair arrived at their home in Croydon following a shopping trip to Sutton with two others on 1 February. The court has heard the toddler had been in the back footwell during the journey and cried out ""mummy"" when Mr Waterson pushed back his seat. Dr Andreas Marnerides, who carried out a joint post mortem examination on Alfie's body, told the jury the three-year-old had been ""healthy"" and there was no ""natural explanation"" for his death. ""We had positive findings it was unnatural, it was trauma related,"" he said. Dr Marnerides said the toddler's injuries were similar to those seen in road traffic collisions and there was ""positive evidence"" they were caused by an ""increase in pressure in the body."" Lots of external petechial haemorrhages - tiny red spots caused by ruptured veins - were found on Alfie's head and body as well as inside his chest cavity, the court heard. Accused 'cried out' after boy's crush death Crush death boy 'told to shut up by mum' Boy, three, killed 'for being too noisy' Dr Marnerides said evidence of internal bleeding was explained by impact to the right side of the body. Jurors were also told Alfie's cause of death was given as ischemic brain injury caused by deprivation of blood or oxygen and compression asphyxia. Ms Hoare denies manslaughter, child cruelty and common assault on Emilie Williams, who was also in the car Mr Waterson denies manslaughter and the intimidation of the car's driver Marcus Lamb. The couple and 19-year-old Ms Williams have pleaded guilty to conspiring to pervert the course of justice by making false statements to police. The trial continues.

"Emma-Jayne Magson, 25, is serving a life sentence for murder Emma-Jayne Magson stabbed her partner with a steak knife then left him to bleed to death. Yet her family believes her murder conviction was a miscarriage of justice. Why? ""I've done what my Dad did to you."" Joanne Smith felt her heart sink as she read the text message from her daughter Emma-Jayne Magson. Two decades earlier Joanne had been stabbed by her partner, and now Emma had fatally stabbed her own partner, 26-year-old James Knight. Emma and James had both been out drinking that night and were thrown out of a taxi because they were rowing. The argument continued in the street and back at Emma's home. At some point Emma picked up a steak knife and plunged it into James's chest, puncturing his heart. James then somehow ended up in the street outside his brother's house, where Emma was seen sitting on top of him. When James's brother and a neighbour tried to help she failed to say she had stabbed him, so they unwittingly left him to die. Despite all of this, Justice for Women, an organisation helping 25-year-old Emma, believes she is one of many women who may have been wrongly convicted of murder after fighting back against abusive partners. The organisation is the same onehelping Sally Challen appeal against a murder convictionfor bludgeoning her ""controlling"" husband to death with a hammer. ""If I honestly thought hand on heart Emma really meant to do that [kill James], I would never stand by Emma,"" says her mother. ""But I just know Emma. I know she loves James. And that's so frustrating for me because I know how much she loves him; even to this day she loves him."" So how did Emma come to kill James Knight? Emma's older sister, Charlotte, was kept at the family home after she died Emma was only eight months old when her father attacked her mother in front of her and her older sister, Charlotte, in 1993. ""He locked me in a flat and stabbed me,"" recalls Joanne. ""They were both in my arms. He went for my throat but as I ran he slashed my legs."" Despite Emma being too young to remember what happened, Joanne says the stabbing had a lasting impact on her. ""We moved around, we went into a safe house,"" says Joanne. ""There were scars on my legs and I had to learn to walk again."" Joanne says Emma had a close relationship with her older sister. ""It was just them,"" says Joanne. ""They had a bedroom together; they did everything together."" Then Charlotte died, aged nine, following a complication from an operation. Joanne sounds regretful when explaining what she did next - her grief-stricken decision to bring Charlotte's body back to the family home for two weeks. Emma was seven years old at the time. ""Charlotte was in my bedroom for a week, in my bed,"" says Joanne. ""For the first week she was in my room then I brought her downstairs in an open casket. ""I don't think I considered anybody but myself."" Joanne said her daughter started ""acting out"" for attention as a teenager While Emma had been quiet as a child she started rebelling as a teenager. ""As she got to about 13 she started drinking, acting out really, mainly for attention,"" says Joanne. Joanne had left Emma's father but says there was violence in a subsequent relationship, and the pattern repeated when Emma got into relationships herself. One of Emma's partners ""fractured her skull and put her in hospital and she had a leak on the brain"". Emma had a daughter, who is now four years old, when she was 21. Joanne says the birth was ""traumatic"" and she suffered from post-natal depression. James Knight had two daughters from his previous relationship Emma met James a year after her daughter was born, in the autumn of 2015. They got together at about the time James's relationship ended with the mother of his two children. James had been staying with one of his brothers in Sylvan Street in Leicester, while Emma lived a few doors down with her daughter. John Skinner, who was friends with James and worked with him as a binman, described him as ""a family man"" who had lots of friends. ""James had a very good group of friends... he was popular in and amongst his mates and at work. ""Whenever he wasn't working with me people always wanted to work with him because they knew you could have a laugh and he would get the work done."" John says the relationship with Emma appeared to begin well. ""When they first got together James looked really happy and bubbly and like he was moving on with his life and he just seemed really happy and settled."" He became aware of arguments creeping in but thought this was normal for a couple getting settled. ""I've seen them have an argument once where it got quite heated but in my opinion they both gave as good as they got,"" says John. ""I've never seen either of them be violent towards each other."" Joanne felt her daughter changed as the relationship went on. ""James wanted her to stay in the home, and James didn't want her to wear makeup,"" she says. John (left) saw Emma and James argue but thought ""they both gave as good as they got"" In the murder trial, the prosecution described their relationship as ""volatile"". Emma's family claim James was physically and emotionally abusive. She ""always had bruises"", her mother says, but would explain them away as ""play fighting"". James's mother, Trish Knight, maintains her son was not violent. ""James has no history of violence towards women,"" she says. ""James was with his previous girlfriend for nine years, who he has got two children with, and there was no violence in that relationship."" The BBC contacted James's former partner but she did not want to contribute to this piece. She told The Sun,externalhe was ""a real romantic"" at the start of the relationship and ""an amazing dad"" to their daughters. However, she discovered James was smoking cannabis and taking steroids towards the end of their relationship. ""It was a far cry from the man I fell in love with,"" she told The Sun. ""It caused row after row and no matter how much I begged him to stop, he didn't listen."" John (right) said James was popular in and outside of work James's mother still insists he would never have hit anyone. ""James could shout, and James had hit a wall. If James lost his temper he would hit a wall rather than hit somebody,"" says Trish. John noticed a physical change in his workmate. ""He did get a lot bigger, obviously, you could tell there was something going off,"" says John. ""Obviously he was always obsessed with looking good... he used to go to the gym after work. ""If you do the job and you work hard it keeps you fit in itself but he went that extra mile."" Emma already had a daughter, who is now four years old Emma miscarried their baby in the middle of March 2016. Miscarriages are known to trigger mental health problems, but Emma's family say the loss was even more traumatic because half of the baby was left inside her despite a hospital procedure intended to remove it. She then returned to hospital for a further procedure to have the remains removed. Emma telephoned her mum to say James blamed her for losing the baby. ""A nurse had to have a word with them in the hospital because he was calling her a slag, saying she was with black men, that's why she lost it,"" says Joanne. James's mum said he had been ""thrilled"" about the prospect of becoming a father again, and she never heard him blame Emma for the miscarriage. ""He was upset,"" Trish says. ""I think he was angry it had happened to them."" Emma claimed she ""didn't mean to harm"" James Emma decided to go on a night out with a friend on Saturday 26 March 2016, the Easter bank holiday weekend. That night, Emma met up with James at a bar in Leicester city centre. Louise Bullivant, her new solicitor, says door staff at the pub asked James to leave because they were concerned about his behaviour. ""There was an incident between James and door staff which resulted in him being asked to leave and Emma decided to leave with him,"" she says. ""There's no doubt that they had both been drinking."" They argued in a taxi and the driver asked them to get out, meaning they had to walk home. During the journey, CCTV captured James grabbing Emma around her shoulder and neck and pushing her to the ground. A statement from Emma was read out in court, in which she claimed she stabbed James in self-defence. ""Once in the kitchen, he grabbed me around my throat and pushed me back,"" it said. ""I was right next to the sink and reached out to grab something. I picked up the first thing which came to hand which was a steak knife; the knife was in my hand and I hit out once. ""I didn't mean to harm him, I just wanted to get him off'."" ""I think something triggered; I think she had had enough,"" says Joanne. James's mum says nobody really knows what happened. ""There were only two people who were there that night and one of them can't give his version of events,"" says Trish. Emma said she stabbed James in the kitchen of her house in Sylvan Street, Leicester James did not die immediately. In fact, he somehow ended up outside his brother Kevin's house a few doors away, lying face down in the street, at about 02:30. Kevin and a neighbour, Michal Ladic, came out to help but Emma did not tell either of them she had stabbed James. ""He was still alive when I came to them,"" says Michal. ""I wanted to turn him around but she was sitting on him. He was face down, topless, she was sitting on him. ""I asked if he was all right and she said he was just drunk."" In his evidence at the trial, Kevin said Emma told him James was drunk and had been beaten up by bouncers earlier on. When asked what impression he got from Emma, Kevin said: ""That everything will be fine in the morning - he just needs to sleep it off."" Kevin helped lift James into Emma's house and placed him on the floor of the front room. Kevin did not realise his brother had been stabbed and left, telling him: ""I will see you tomorrow."" 'My mum killed my dad but I want her freed' Why doesn't prison work for women? Is it time for Scotland to stop jailing so many women? Emma rang 999 and asked for an ambulance, but again did not mention James had been stabbed. When asked what had happened she said: ""Um, I don't know, my boyfriend's here and he's making weird noises. I don't know what's going on."" Later in the call she said: ""It looks like he's had a fight with someone."" When the operator explained the ambulance might take a while, she replied: ""No, that's fine, don't worry about it."" The prosecution claimed Emma deceived people into not saving James's life, and described her as ""cold, brutal and manipulative"". However, her mother believes she simply didn't realise James was dying. ""I don't think she knew how serious it was in that moment,"" says Joanne. James was known as ""King James"" and Emma got a tattoo in tribute to him after his death Kevin was awoken by Emma banging on his door, screaming that James was dead, about 40 minutes after he had seen them both outside his house. Kevin went to Emma's house and Michal was already there trying to save his life, having heard Emma's screams. ""We didn't know he had been stabbed,"" says Michal. ""The body was so clean, nothing on him, and only when I gave him mouth-to-mouth and the second breath raised his chest and that wound opened and my eyes popped out. I just took the phone from Kev and told the operator that he was stabbed in the heart. ""Then I was trying to do the CPR for another 15 minutes and she was getting in my way, like 'I want him back, I just want him to wake up'. ""I remember telling Kev to drag her off him, and he did it, he took her off so I could carry on with the mouth-to-mouth and CPR."" Emma's grandmother says she saw marks around Emma's neck Emma phoned her grandmother, who got a taxi straight there. ""The ambulance had taken James away,"" says Lynda Allen. ""There were police everywhere. Eventually, they let me go through and she walked down the road to me. All she had got on was a little nightdress, no shoes, nothing. ""She put her head on my shoulder, crying."" Lynda noticed marks around her neck, which were also noted when Emma was later examined in police custody. Emma was not initially arrested as police did not realise she was responsible for stabbing James. She was allowed to go to her mother's house, where she told her mother she thought she had killed James, who told police. Emma was then arrested and taken away after being allowed to say goodbye to her daughter. Emma decided not to give evidence at her trial Unusually for someone accused of murder, Emma remained on bail throughout her trial at Leicester Crown Court. Her new solicitor believes this ""says a great deal about the court's approach to the evidence"". Emma decided not to give evidence herself, but her legal team argued she had acted in self-defence, did not intend to kill or harm James, and had suffered a loss of control. Her family believe she was scared and did not understand what was happening during the trial. ""How can I put it without sounding nasty?"" says her grandmother. ""Emma's very slow on the uptake. If you said something to Emma and she didn't understand it, where it's quite simple to me and you, I would have to sit and explain everything to her. ""I don't understand the law but I would have thought there would be somebody there to talk things through with her that she didn't understand."" Emma's new solicitor believes if she had been supported by an intermediary, such as a trained social worker, she might have followed the trial better and participated effectively. Emma was found guilty of murder in November 2016 and given a life sentence with a minimum term of 17 years. Joanne takes Emma's daughter to visit her in prison every week After the trial ended, Emma's mother was approached by a police officer who told her to contact Justice for Women. The group helped Emma get a new legal team, which is trying to appeal against the murder conviction using psychiatric evidence. The original psychiatrist instructed by the defence team had diagnosed Emma as having an emotionally unstable personality disorder (EUPD), but for some reason this was not used as evidence at her trial. Emma's new legal team went back to this psychiatrist for a further assessment, and also instructed a clinical psychologist who diagnosed Emma as having a pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS). Even the psychiatric expert originally instructed by the prosecution now agrees that Emma was suffering from a recognised medical condition at the time of the killing. ""He says he has revised his view and now supports a diagnosis of EUPD and PDD-NOS,"" says Emma's solicitor. A petition was launched demanding ""justice for James"", saying that Emma should stay in prison and ""do her time"". However, Court of Appeal judges in London have found Emma has an ""arguable"" case and granted permission to appeal. Emma speaks to her young daughter on the phone every day, and she visits the prison every week. ""They are so close,"" says Joanne. ""She's going to see her mum today and she said 'I'm going to my mum's house, I can't wait. I love my mum's house'. ""It's just so sad."" Trish says her son James had no history of abuse in his relationships For James's young daughters, their weekly visits are to his grave. ""They ask if Daddy is watching them,"" says Trish. ""One of his daughters when she's old enough wants to go in the sky to see Daddy."" Joanne empathises with James's mum, but maintains Emma should not have been convicted of murder. ""I've lost a child so I know what James's mum is going through. I understand, I really do,"" she says. ""I just hope Emma can come out and be a mum to her daughter and get on with her life. ""She will never forget James ever, she won't. I know that she loves James and I know that if she could take that night back she would. 100% she would."" On 22 November the Court of Appeal granted permission for Emma-Jayne Magson to appeal against her murder conviction. Her legal team is waiting for a date for the next hearing.

"Mistaken Ident-E.T.? One user asked if the thief's getaway vehicle had been a ""BMX with a basket on the front"" A police e-fit of a burglary suspect has been mocked for its likeness to movie alien E.T. Staffordshire Police published the mock-up of a ""very skinny"" suspect with wide eyes and a long neck, expecting the public's response to be good. But its effort was widely derided, with one social media user asking if the thief's getaway vehicle had been a ""BMX with a basket on the front"". The force said it hoped the ""valid appeal"" would yield useful information. Its Facebook page was deluged with hundreds of comments noting the resemblance to Steven Spielberg's 1982 creation. One user wrote: ""Don't think E.T. is going to phone the police."" While another added: ""Someone find this woman urgently. She needs to phone home."" And a further comment read: ""If I see her I won't be calling Staffordshire Police, I'll be calling Mulder and Scully."" Other users compared the image to Coronation Street's beleaguered Gail Platt and Harry Potter villain Lord Voldemort. In reply to the comments, police said: ""Thank you for all the interest and shares, we can confirm E.T. was at home and no fictional soap characters are potential suspects."" The alien was the star of the film E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, released in 1982 The force is seeking information about four people who forced entry to a home on Richard Cooper Road in Shenstone, Lichfield, just before 21:00 GMT on 3 January. Cash and electronic equipment were taken before the offenders fled the scene in an Audi. Latest news and updates from the West Midlands Police not smiling over ""Cheshire Cat"" e-fit 'Fred Flintstone' lookalike sought by police The force described the suspect as a very skinny woman in her mid-30s with light blonde hair.

"We drink two coffees out of more than 100 types growing naturally The first full assessment of risks to the world's coffee plants shows that 60% of 124 known species are on the edge of extinction. More than 100 types of coffee tree grow naturally in forests, including two used for the coffee we drink. Scientists say the figure is ""worrying"", as wild coffee is critical for sustaining the global coffee crop. About one in five of the world's plants is threatened with extinction, and the 60% figure is an ""extremely high"" one. ""If it wasn't for wild species we wouldn't have as much coffee to drink in the world today,"" said Dr Aaron Davis of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. ""Because if you look at the history of coffee cultivation, we have used wild species to make the coffee crop sustainable."" Arabica originated in the highlands of Ethiopia Research published in the journal, Science Advances,,externalfound conservation measures were ""inadequate"" for wild coffees, including those considered ""critical"" for  long-term global coffee production. The study found that 75 wild coffee species are considered threatened with extinction, 35 are not threatened and too little is known about the remaining 14 to make any judgement. Furthermore, it was found that 28% of wild coffee species grow outside protected areas and only about half are preserved in seed banks. A second study, in Global Change Biology,,externalfound that wild Arabica coffee can be classed as threatened under official (IUCN Red List) rankings, when climate change projections are taken into account. Its natural population is likely to shrink by up to 50% or more by 2088 because of climate change alone, according to the research. Wild Arabica is used to supply seeds for coffee farming and also as a harvested crop in its own right. Ethiopia is the home of Arabica coffee, where it grows naturally in upland rainforests. ""Given the importance of Arabica coffee to Ethiopia, and to the world, we need to do our utmost to understand the risks facing its survival in the wild,"" said Dr Tadesse Woldemariam Gole, of the Environment and Coffee Forest Forum in Addis Ababa. Many coffee drinkers are unaware that we only use the coffee beans from two species -Coffea ArabicaandCoffea robusta- in the thousands of different blends of coffee on sale. Coffee comes in many blends, but relies on two species In fact, there are 122 coffee species on top of that which occur naturally in the wild. Many of these wild coffees do not taste good to drink, but may contain genes that can be harnessed to help coffee plants survive in the future, amid climate change and emerging diseases that attack coffee trees. Will coffee taste worse as the planet warms? Seeds hold hidden treasures for future food Wild crops pushed to brink of extinction Wild food crops to be 'rescued',external In the longer term, we will need to call on wild species to safeguard the future of the world's coffee crop, say researchers. ""We will call on those wild resources time and time again,"" said Dr Davis. Globally, about one in five plants is threatened with extinction, compared with 60% for coffee. As a comparison, about half of wild tea and mango species are threatened with extinction, 6% of hazelnuts and 9% of pistachios. The vast majority of wild coffee grows in the remote forests of Africa and on the island of Madagascar. Beyond Africa, wild coffee is found in other tropical climates, including parts of India, Sri Lanka, and Australia. Global coffee trade relies on two species - Arabica (Coffea arabica) and Robusta (Coffea canephora). Coffee plantation in Colombia A third species - Liberica (Coffea liberica) is grown around the world, but is rarely used for coffee drinks. Crop wild relatives are wild plants that are genetically related to cultivated crops. They continue to evolve in the wild, and can be crossed with domesticated crops. They have been used to improve the yields and nutritional quality of crops since the dawn of agriculture. They say we must understand the risks to coffee farming and make sure we have the resources in place to overcome threats. Coffee trees, like many tropical plants, have seeds that do not survive the freeze-drying process used in conventional seed banks - 45% of coffee species have not been ""backed up"" outside the wild. Dr Eimear Nic Lughadha of Kew said this is the first time an IUCN Red List assessment has been carried out to find the extinction risk of the world's coffee, and the figure of 60% is ""extremely high"". ""We hope this new data will highlight species to be prioritised for the sustainability of the coffee production sector, so that appropriate action can be taken to safeguard the species,"" she said.

"This video can not be played The world-famous tidying wizard visited Woman's Hour in 2017 If you haven't heard of Marie Kondo yet, it won't be long before you do. Thanks to her new Netflix programme, the Japanese tidying guru has become January's ""It girl"". Chance is, you already know someone who is using her ""KonMari"" method, which promises not only a de-cluttered house, but also a clean mind. ""When you put your house in order, you put your affairs, and your past in order, too,"" Kondo explains in her 2014 book, The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying. ""As a result, you can see quite clearly what you need and what you don't, and what you should and shouldn't do."" But is it really as simple as asking whether everything you own truly ""sparks joy"" and then throwing away anything that doesn't? Jerrie Sharp and her partner were inspired to get rid of about a third of the belongings in their London home after watching Tidying Up with Marie Kondo. The impact it has made on their mental health, she says, is visible. ""My partner is bi-polar, and he saw a massive difference having his office clear,"" the radiographer said. ""He had so much stuff in there before. ""And I have become more productive purely from having no distractions. All the books on my shelves are ones I love - I am no longer looking and thinking, 'I've not read that'."" Abigail Evans, who has only recently started following the KonMari method, agreed the positive effects were instantaneous. ""I cannot rest until I know my room's tidy,"" the 26-year-old admitted. That meant that following Kondo's advice and doing a little bit at a time really worked. ""I've always been the kind of person who likes a de-clutter, and she makes it seem really easy."" For Joseph Ferrari, a professor of psychology at Chicago's DePaul University, this kind of response makes sense. In fact, he would argue you should maybe go further than Marie Kondo recommends when clearing out your home. Marie Kondo giving advice on her television show Prof Ferrari's joint 2016 study, The Dark Side of the Home, found the more clutter people have, the lower their life satisfaction - and the lower the productivity. ""Clutter is not a good thing,"" he explained. ""We are living in this society where our wants become needs,"" he added. ""What we need to do is let go of things. I tell people, do not collect relics, collect relationships."" It is not just Marie Kondo and Prof Ferrari advocating the virtues of de-cluttering. There are plenty of other experts out there extolling the benefits, whether it be the home, the office - or even your email inbox. Marie Kondo v book hoarders Where are you on the 'clutter scale'? Hoarder: 'My house was a hovel' Take ""Inbox Zero"", an email management system which should, in theory, mean you end each evening with no emails in your main inbox, having rigorously sorted, deleted and forwarded every message which arrived during the day. It might seem like an unachievable dream for those of us with thousands of unread emails, but people who achieve this inbox nirvana swear by it - not least, for the positive effect on their mental health. ""Most of my stress is because I might have forgotten things or am not on top of things, so this helps me relax,"" explains one of my colleagues. But the current craze for a de-cluttered life does not end when you have finally thrown away the last spark-free item. Social media accounts that advocate the joy of cleaning are also sweeping the internet. There is no underestimating the interest in such accounts: just look at Sophie Hinchliffe - better known as Mrs Hinch - and her impressive 1.6 million followers on Instagram, not to mention the book deal with Penguin, all thanks to her cleaning advice.

Her house, in fairness, is utterly spotless. But while many people are inspired by her pristine home and fastidious approach to cleaning, it has left others feeling a little wanting. ""Her immaculate house just made me feel depressed about my own home so I unfollowed her,"" admitted one mother on the website Mumsnet. Marie Kondo's de-cluttered homes have not been immune to criticism either - not least for adding another layer of stress to already stressful lives. ""The media that surrounds us - both social and mainstream, from Marie Kondo's new Netflix show to the lifestyle influencer economy - tells us that our personal spaces should be optimised just as much as one's self and career,""argued Anne Helen Petersen in her Buzzfeed piece on How Millenials Became the Burnout Generation.,external ""The end result isn't just fatigue, but enveloping burnout that follows us to home and back."" But could it be worse than that? After all, too much of anything can be a bad thing. ""Do we just assume thatde-cluttering is a good thing because it's the opposite of hoarding?"" New York psychologist Vivien Diller wondered,externalin The Atlantic back in 2015, pointing to patients who felt a compulsive need to de-clutter. ""You take somebody who cannot tolerate mess or cannot sit still without cleaning or throwing things out, and we're talking about a symptom,"" she noted. So where, exactly, does all this leave those of us who really aren't that bothered by a little bit of mess, and are never likely to consider whether their socks truly give them joy? Luckily, you have your own guru (sort of). Meet Tim Harford, columnist, radio presenter and author of Messy: How To be Creative and Resilient in a Tidy-Minded World. US founding father Benjamin Franklin - proof successful people can have messy desks But first, an admission. ""I actually did Marie Kondo on my clothes, and it works,"" he said. However, Mr Harford argues, a messy desk really isn't the end of the world - and the idea everything can automatically be sorted into its proper place within moments of its arrival is not always true. ""When you are being creative - when you are doing stuff - things get messy,"" he told the BBC. ""Trying to tidy things up too early or too often - it is going to lead you to beat yourself up unnecessarily."" And for those of us feeling down about our inability to eliminate clutter, live in immaculate homes or get our inboxes down to zero, there is always the example of the author, investor and founding father of the US, Benjamin Franklin. ""He had this virtue journal where he kept track of all the ways he was going to be a better person,"" Mr Harford explained. ""Looking back at the end of his life, that virtue journal had really worked. ""But, he said, there is just one thing I could never do - and that was be tidy."" Where are you on the 'clutter scale'?
