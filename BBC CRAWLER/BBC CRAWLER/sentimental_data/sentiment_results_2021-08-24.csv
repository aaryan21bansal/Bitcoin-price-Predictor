"Sharon Graham would be Unite's first female leader Sharon Graham looks set to become the first female leader of the Unite union, taking over from Len McCluskey. The head of the union's organisation department was not Mr McCluskey's preferred choice. He had backed Steve Turner, an assistant general secretary of the union who had run his previous campaigns for general secretary. But in a text message to supporters this evening, Mr Turner - once seen as the favourite - appeared to concede. He said: ""It appears Sharon has got it! Sorry it didn't work out for us. ""Thanks for everything and we will make the formal announcement tomorrow."" Who might lead the Unite union and why it matters Unite to elect new leader by end of summer Gerard Coyne, the candidate seen as most sympathetic to Sir Keir Starmer, seems set to come third. Insiders are estimating that Ms Graham could have a majority of around 6,000 votes over Mr Turner, with Mr Coyne narrowly behind. The health warning is that the formal vote count only gets under way on Wednesday. But after ballots had been sorted in to respective piles, and extensively ""sampled"" to check for discrepancies, members of all three campaign teams that spoke to the BBC tonight expected a victory for Ms Graham. A fourth candidate, Howard Beckett,pulled out earlier in the contestand threw his support behind Mr Turner. Unite is the Labour Party's biggest trade union funder and, under Mr McCluskey, it strongly backed Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader. Mr McCluskey has been very critical of Sir Keir's tenure and has funded legal challenges to the party over suspensions and expulsions. Two Unite top job nominees warn on Labour funding Battle to succeed Unite's Len McCluskey heats up Although also on the Left, Ms Graham campaigned on putting more emphasis on the workplace, and far less on Westminster politics. Those who know her say she has little interest in Labour's internal wrangling. While Labour sources say they are relaxed about her expected win, she may still give them anxious moments. The union gave the party Â£3m in the run up to the 2019 election, but when I previously interviewed Ms Graham she said she wanted to see ""payment by results"". While she did not campaign explicitly on reducing contributions to Labour, she did say she would not give the party ""a blank cheque"". And party and union could soon be at loggerheads over job cuts at Labour's HQ. But it may be employers rather than Labour leaders who have the most to fear from her leadership. She told the BBC: ""Unashamedly, I am talking about jobs, pay and conditions as the number one, number two and number three priorities of the organisation."" She said she often gets involved in industrial disputes when they turn hostile, and puts some of her victories down to what is called ""leverage"", meaning applying pressure on multi-national companies to resolve sometimes local problems. For example, to help settle a dispute at a bus company in England she brought its behaviour to the notice of the Swedish government, putting the awarding of a potentially lucrative contract there at risk. Her likely victory was welcomed by left-wing campaign group Momentum, which praised ""the use of leverage to take on bad bosses"". Her ""back to the workplace"" message may have eaten in to some of Mr Coyne's support, as he also campaigned on less meddling in Labour's internal affairs. And with turnout expected to be even lower than the 12.2% achieved in the 2017 contest, those who are most active in the union are most likely to have voted. And many of them may have had direct experience of successful disputes led by Ms Graham. Her supporters say she is on the verge of a ""historic"" win. A spokesman for her campaign said: ""She has fought against the odds and triumphed. We were told she was a no-hoper, now it looks she has won. ""Unite workers have come behind her banner. It's time Unite went back to what it says on the trade union tin - fighting relentlessly for jobs, pay and conditions."" Last year, another huge union, Unison, elected its first female leader, Christine McAnea. There is certainly a change in style at the top of the union movement but it looks like there could also be a change of substance as Mr McCluskey's 11 year tenure at the top of Unite draws to a close.

"Visitors are also being encouraged to take lateral flow tests if they visit Cornwall Tourists have been urged to stay away from Cornwall unless they have pre-booked a trip because of a huge spike in Covid cases. The latest figures show Cornwall has770 cases per 100,000 people, double the previous week's figure. The UK also recorded 174 new Covid-related deaths on Tuesday - the highest figure since March. Malcolm Bell, head of Visit Cornwall, is calling on visitors to help keep the region safe. He said: ""We are asking people not to come unless they have booked ahead and request they take a lateral flow test before, during and after their stay so that people can be safe and help us to manage the current spike."" Mr Bell said the county had witnessed ""too many occurrences of overcrowding in honeypots"" - places thatattract mass tourism- and urged visitors to consider visiting less popular parts of Cornwall. ""We have over 300 beaches and lovely parts that can cope with visitors,"" he said. On Monday, Cornwall Council said4,700 cases may be linked to the Boardmasters festivalheld in Newquay. About 800 of those positive cases are people who live in Cornwall. Jack Stacey, from Staffordshire, told the BBC he caught Covid at Boardmasters and wished he had not gone. ""My whole family's got it now so I regret going to be honestâ¦ It wasn't worth it,"" he said. The 20-year-old, who is not vaccinated, said he was ""shocked"" at how ill the virus made him, leaving him bed-bound for nine days. Others were overjoyed at being able to party at a festival again. Festival organisers said in terms of Covid restrictions they ""went above and beyond what was asked of us"" Rosie Breakwell, 22, from Bath, said she also caught Covid there after receiving her first jab, but said she ""got over it pretty quickly"". ""I live for festivals so not having one in two years was just horrendous, and it was just so nice being back in a sweaty field with everyone,"" she said. Virologist Dr David Strain said music festivals were ""something that is important for mental health of a younger generation who have missed out on so much"". The lecturer at the University of Exeter Medical School said: ""It would have been nicer to have left it a month or so later so 17-18 year olds would have been double vaccinated."" But he said he ""probably would have made the same decision"" for it to go ahead. Dr Strain said 18-25 year olds had a ""very low risk of being hospitalised"" with coronavirus, but the ""real test"" of how the festival had impacted young people would be the number of long Covid cases that emerged. Analysis from Steve Holden, Newsbeat music reporter Boardmasters is a good reminder that just because large events are now allowed to take place, Covid-19 hasn't simply disappeared. As long as cases linked to festivals aren't landing people in hospital, making them seriously ill or putting pressure on the NHS, then organisers would argue the vaccination programme is reducing the public health risk. We're about to head into a bank holiday that is likely to be the busiest weekend of live music and festivals in the UK since the start of the pandemic. Thousands of people will be attending the likes of Reading and Leeds, Creamfields, Manchester Pride and All Points East in London and based on what's happened following Boardmasters, we can assume there will be a rise in cases linked to these events. By now, anyone attending knows there's going to be a risk of catching or spreading the virus when a large group of people share the same space. Festivals were ""core to the mental health of the younger generation"" said virologist Dr David Strain A condition of entry to Boardmasters was use of theNHS Covid Pass,external- a measure recommended as best-practiceÂ for other large events. Festival organisers said the systems they put in place meant more thanÂ 450 people were found to be at risk of passing on the virus ""and as a result did not attend our Watergate Bay site or left the festival early"". They said: ""We are grateful to them and everyone else who took the extra steps this year. ""No event is able to eliminate risk entirely. ""We look forward to sharing our experience with our local authority partners and other large events so we can all continue to provide much-needed economic benefit to our communities and entertainment to our loyal audiences."" In Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly there were 770 cases per 100,000 people in the seven days to 20 August. The figure for the previous week to 13 August was 384 cases per 100,000. Newquay's beaches have attracted tourists and surfers to the region Three parts of Newquaynow have the three highest Covid infection rates in Englandfor the seven days up to 18 August. The town's mayor, Lewis Gardner, said they had been working tirelessly ""all summer"" to keep Covid rates down. ""We've done vaccination pop-up centres, we've been handing out lateral flow tests, we've given advice to businesses,"" he told the BBC. ""And it just seems that everything we do, no matter what we do, the rates keep creeping up."" Follow BBC News South West onTwitter,external,Facebook,externalandInstagram,external.

"Despite numerous appeals, searches, arrests and interviews, Claudia Lawrence's case remains unsolved A popular fishing spot is being searched by police investigating the suspected murder of Claudia Lawrence. The 35-year-old's disappearance has remained a mystery since she failed to turn up for work at the University of York in March 2009. North Yorkshire Police said its latest search at Sand Hutton gravel pits, about eight miles (13km) outside York, was expected to take a number of days. The force said it could not disclose what had led officers to the location. Det Supt Wayne Fox, who took over as senior investigating officer in the case earlier this year, said teams of specialist officers, including underwater search teams, would spend several days at the site. He said the searches were among ""several active lines of inquiry"" being pursued amid efforts to establish what happened to Claudia and ""identify any person responsible for causing her harm"". Ms Lawrence's family had been notified about the search, he added. What happened to Claudia Lawrence? More from Yorkshire The former gravel pits at Sand Hutton sit to the north-east of York, close to the busy A64. Popular with anglers, the site is believed to have been used as fishing ponds since the late 1960s. Police cordoned off a large section of woodland surrounding the waters on Tuesday as officers searched undergrowth along a public bridleway which runs through the area. The search is expected to last a number of days, police said University chef Ms Lawrence was last seen at 15.05 on Wednesday 18 March walking towards her home on Heworth Road. Later that evening she spoke to both her parents, Joan and Peter Lawrence, by phone, but the following day failed to arrive for her job at Goodricke College. A friend who became concerned when she failed to meet at a local pub that evening contacted Ms Lawrence's father, who reported her missing on 20 March. The Sand Hutton gravel pits lie in woodland north-east of York In April 2009, police confirmed they were treating her disappearance as a case of suspected murder. Nine people have been questioned in connection with her disappearance, but no charges have ever been brought. North Yorkshire Police said the investigation had been difficult because Ms Lawrence did not use social media or own a smartphone. The force scaled back its investigation in 2017, however it said it would investigate any fresh lead or evidence in the case. Peter Lawrence, seen here on the 10th anniversary of his daughter's disappearance, died in February Ms Lawrence's father, Peter, died in February without finding out what had happened to his daughter. The 74-year-old had lobbied for a change in the law, which came into force in 2019, to allow relatives to take control of their missing loved ones' financial affairs. Mr Lawrence was appointed an OBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours in 2018 in recognition of his campaigning. Follow BBC Yorkshire onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external.

"Just Eat will create more than 1,500 customer service jobs in north-eastern England in the next 12 months. The jobs will be based at a new facility in Sunderland as part of a Â£100m investment in the region by the firm over the next five years. Currently, the takeaway food firm has more than 2,000 UK-based employees. New employees will begin working from home and the firm will offer employees the option to work from the office in the coming months. Takeaway apps 'more expensive' than buying direct Just Eat to stop using gig economy workers Eat more vegetables says new report Just Eat said it had already hired 300 staff in Sunderland and noted that customer satisfaction had gone up as a result. Previously, the firm had outsourced the majority of its customer service roles to Bulgaria and the Philippines. Its UK managing director, Andrew Kenny, said the move was about positioning the firm for future growth. ""The [takeaway] industry has changed a lot over the past 18 months,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. ""New trends have emerged such as significant growth over breakfast and lunch. We're very confident that many of the behaviours that kicked off during Covid will sustain themselves."" The delivery platform has more than 58,000 restaurant partners across the UK. Councillor Graeme Miller, leader of Sunderland City Council, said: ""We're thrilled to have supported Just Eat to make its move to Sunderland, joining a dynamic business community and creating jobs and opportunities for people across the city."" ""We're immensely proud of our skilled people and look forward to seeing how they drive the onward success of the Just Eat business,"" he added. The office, in Houghton le Spring, was previously occupied by Npower and will provide a gym, lounge and catering area across its 20,000 sq-m space. Just Eat was founded by a group of five Danish entrepreneurs in 2000 and launched a year later. Last year, online food ordering company Takeaway.com won a battle for the UK-listed Just Eat with a Â£5.9bn all-share offer. It made Just Eat Takeaway.com one of the world's largest meal delivery companies. Earlier this month, the company reported that sales rose 52% in the first half of 2021, reflecting a robust growth in orders during the coronavirus pandemic. In June, consumer organisation Which?researched the price of ordering mealsfor between two to four people from five restaurants and cafes. On average, Which? found that ordering through Just Eat was 7% more expensive than ordering directly from the restaurant.

"This video can not be played Josh Willis says he and his wife Samantha ""always thought we had another 40 or more years together"" The husband of a woman who died with Covid-19 shortly after giving birth has spoken about the pain of losing her. Samantha Willis, 35, who had not been vaccinated for Covid-19, died on Friday after spending 16 days in hospital. The mother-of-four from Londonderry was buried on Monday after a service in which her new-born daughter child was baptised. ""We always thought we had 40 or more years together,"" her husband Josh Willis told BBC News NI. He said he thought they would have that time ""to share experiences and watch the wee ones grow up"". A funeral for Samantha Willis took place in Derry on Monday ""Birthdays, communions, whatever it is - it was all taken away,"" he said. ""I just hope that she knows how I felt about her and I hope the way that we coped getting through the wake and the funeral and doing this sort of thing, that she's looking down and we are doing her proud basically."" At the funeral service for Mrs Willis, her two-weeks old daughter Eviegrace was carried behind the coffin. Mr Willis said he and his wife had been taking precautions about coronavirus by using personal protective equipment and avoiding bars and restaurants. Both of them tested positive for the virus on the same day and in the subsequent days Mrs Willis' condition worsened before Mr Willis had to take her to Altnagelvin Area Hospital in Derry. He said that in the days before his wife's death he held her hand and told her: ""We're all here, we're all waiting - fight through it. You have everything to fight for."" Mr Willis said he and some other family members were called into the hospital after her condition worsened on Thursday evening. Josh Willis' daughter Eviegrace was christened on Monday ""I was at the bottom of the bed and I was looking at the screens,"" he said. ""I had an idea about what some of the things on it meant - I seen one that I was pretty sure was the oxygen level and it said 20. ""I said to the nurse beside me: 'Is that her oxygen level?' And she just said: 'She has just literally passed away.''"" Baby girl is baptised as mother is laid to rest Before she died, Mrs Willis had not been able to hold her new-born daughter Eviegrace. Mr Willis said he had tried to arrange for her to hold her child before her condition had worsened. Josh Willis wants to raise awareness of the dangers of Covid-19 among pregnant women after his wife's death ""She carried her for eight months but she never held her in her arms... the one thing I wanted was for her to see her baby and to hold her,"" he said. Mrs Willis had not been vaccinated for Covid-19 when she died - her husband said he wants to raise vaccination awareness after his wife's death. ""I just want to put her story out there... I think if she could help one person, one family, she would be happy,"" he said. Mr Willis said when he was standing at his wife's graveside on Monday, he could hear her in his head saying: ""I'm gone, batter on, raise the wains, do what youse have to do."" ""We have no choice, and if it was the other way around she would do the same. I would be probably telling her the same,"" he said.

"Self-catered accommodation in the UK is costing on average 40% more than in the summer of 2019, according to consumer group Which?. Its analysis,external, with BBC Panorama, suggests holidaymakers are paying an average of Â£300 more per week in August compared to before the pandemic. Brighton is among the seaside resorts with soaring prices, with average rental costs almost doubling. The data is from AirDNA, which monitors websites such as Airbnb and Vrbo. BBC News has approached Airbnb for comment. The company has previously claimed figures from third-party organisations can be misleading. Airbnb extends party ban until end of summer How a village is changing to meet staycation demand The quirky holiday lets that are nothing like home Watch BBC Panorama: The Great British Staycation? at 19:30 BST on Wednesday on BBC One, or later on BBC iPlayer More than 20 million Britons planned to holiday in the UK this year,according to research by market research company Opinium,external. The average cost of one night of self-catered accommodation for two people in Brighton was Â£109 in 2019, but is now Â£206 - a rise of 89% - according to AirDNA's data. Meanwhile, stays in St Helier in Jersey increased by 76% on 2019, and Lyme Regis on the south coast jumped up 74%. Catherine Lane, who lets out six properties in Brighton, told BBC Panorama she put up some of her prices this year because her costs had risen considerably. ""Now we have to have cleaning and sanitation costs, which are much higher. We have to have time for the cleaners to disinfect the place,"" she said. She said prices had gone up to meet the high demand, but added: ""A lot of pricing we don't have control over. ""If you're booking by third-party advertising website, they're putting commissions on the actual end price."" Holiday booking site Vrbo told BBC Panorama it ""does not set, change or influence the property prices a host chooses"". Which? also looked at how big the price difference can be between holidaying in the UK and travelling abroad - even when flights are factored in. Its research compared prices for late August getaways for two people in the UK and abroad, looking at the cheapest, highly-rated hotel available in a central location, as well as transport costs. For a coastal break, it found a week in Brighton for Â£1,131, while a hotel in Nice in the south of France, which included flights, cost Â£1,085. Elsewhere, a week in Lake Windermere in the England's Lake District cost Â£2,424, compared to just Â£802 for flights and accommodation for a week in Lake Garda in northern Italy. Which? compared properties near Lake Windermere (left) and Lake Garda (right) Which? travel editor Rory Boland said: ""We're not talking about Â£10, we're not talking about the cost of a meal out. We're talkingâ¦ hundreds and hundreds of pounds."" He said the reason behind the differences in price wasn't just down to the pandemic. ""When we looked at it, accommodation prices in 2019 were more expensive in the UK than they were abroad. So this isn't a pandemic problem only, the pandemic has made it worse,"" Mr Boland added.

"School pupils still need to wear masks in class Nicola Sturgeon has said she cannot rule out the reintroduction of some Covid restrictions as the number of daily cases reached a  record high. The first minister said the country was at another ""fragile and pivotal moment"" in the pandemic. She said she hopes not to have to reintroduce restrictions, and that if this happened they would be as limited and proportionate as possible. A total of 4,323 new cases were reported on Tuesday. The previous highest level was during the summer wave in early July, when the number of daily cases peaked at 4,234. Live coverage of the first minister's briefing Scottish Covid inquiry to start later this year What are Scotland's Covid rules? The Scottish government has also announced that apublic inquiry into the handling of the Covid pandemicwill begin by the end of the year. Ms Sturgeon told a Covid briefing that there had been a ""sharp rise"" in Covid-19 cases in recent days. ""New cases in Scotland have more than doubled over the past week, and that is one of the sharpest rises we have experienced at any point during the pandemic,"" she said. She said the latest daily figure was the largest recorded in a single day - although more testing was now being carried out than in earlier stages of the pandemic. The first minister said: ""We always knew cases were likely to rise as restrictions eased, so to some extent what we are seeing now is not entirely unexpected. ""That said, the scale of the increase is still a cause of real concern."" Ms Sturgeon said it was a ""fragile and pivotal"" moment, adding: ""If this surge continues and accelerates and we start to see evidence of substantial increase in serious illness, we cannot completely rule out having to reimpose some restrictions. We hope not to do that."" Ms Sturgeon said people could take steps such as getting vaccinated, sticking to the rules on face coverings, and being mindful of physical distancing, unnecessary contacts and ventilation. The first minister said vaccination was ""making a big difference"" and that many of the new cases were in younger people, who were ""less likely"" to have had both doses of vaccine. 'No single reason' for Dumfries and Galloway surge Where are the latest cases in Scotland? She said that about half of all new cases were in people under the age of 25 with 34% of Tuesday's tally in the under 19s. An additional 10 deaths linked to Covid were reported, taking the total under the daily measure to 8,080. The test positivity rate was 14.5%, up from 12.4% the previous day. Covid restrictions were eased earlier this year A total of 4,085,552 people have received the first dose of a Covid-19 vaccination, and 3,587,145 have had their second. Most of the Covid restrictions in Scotland were lifted when the country moved beyond the level zero rules on 9 August. Physical distancing rules and the limits on gatherings were removed, and all venues were allowed to reopen. There were also changes to rules on self-isolation - but face coverings still need to be worn in many public spaces, including schools. Is the first minister preparing us for the return of restrictions? Well, not necessarily. Her now trademark cautious tone was there. She described the state of the pandemic as ""fragile"" and spoke about ""real concern"" over rising cases. But Nicola Sturgeon was also keen to stress the impact of the vaccination programme on the number of people becoming seriously ill with the virus. That will be a key barometer for ministers when it comes to the next steps. Further increases in cases could lead to greater pressure on the NHS - and the government may then have to act. The door hasn't been closed on the reintroduction of Covid measures. But today's briefing could be described as a warning shot about what might come further down the tracks, rather than laying the groundwork of an inevitable move backwards. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said: ""Nicola Sturgeon's lingering threat to impose more constraints on people's lives is unjustifiable, given the success of Scotland and the UK's vaccine scheme. ""The public want to move on but Nicola Sturgeon is unable or unwilling to give up the control she has had. Just a few weeks after most Covid rules have been dropped, she's talking of bringing them back. She seems determined to prolong restrictions, no matter the cost to jobs, our NHS or people's mental health."" He added: ""This is a different phase of the pandemic, when NHS remobilisation and rebuilding Scotland's economy should be our top priorities."" Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Alex Cole-Hamilton said the rising case numbers were ""troubling"". He said: ""I think it is very telling that was not met with the introduction of further restrictions. ""It suggests we have moved to a different phase in Covid where we have accepted we have to live around it, and it will be a fact of life for the foreseeable future.""

"Government plans to decarbonise homes are too complicated and confusing, according to a coalition of consumer and industry groups. They've written to the prime minister to say that current schemes to adapt homes go wrong far too often. The open letter, from Citizens Advice and others, calls for more financial support for making changes. Otherwise, they argue, efforts to curb emissions from millions of homes in the UK will be at risk. Europe's extreme rains made more likely by humans Talks resume on global plan to protect nature Climate change protesters erect giant pink table Tackling energy use in the residential sector is seen as key to the government's aim of getting to net zero by 2050. Net zero involves reducing greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible and then balancing out any further releases by absorbing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere by, for example, planting trees. The carbon generated by home heating amounts to about 20% of all UK emissions. But the government's current efforts to help householders to adapt their homes are ""too complicated"", and too often things go wrong, say industry and consumer groups. Traditional gas boilers will need to be replaced if the UK is to hit net zero emissions by 2050 The coalition includes Citizens Advice, the Federation of Master Builders, the Aldersgate Group and Which? They argue that the process of installing low-carbon heating, upgrading insulation or putting in smart technologies is ""time consuming, confusing and stressful"". They cite the example of the Green Homes Grant, a scheme that was designed to help people insulate their homes. It was scrapped in March this year afterreaching just 10% of the housesthat the government had promised would be improved. According to the coalition, simply choosing the right technology or finding a reputable installer demands huge amounts of time, knowledge and effort. Far too often, things go wrong with poor installation and technologies not working as expected. The letter to the prime minister says there are three key concerns that need to be addressed to ensure that plans to decarbonise homes don't fail. Information:According to the coalition, people need more accessible and unbiased information on steps, including installing low-carbon heating and upgrading their insulation. Consumer protections:The letter points out that previous energy efficiency schemes, such as the Green Homes Grant, have been marred by scammers and rogue traders. The coalition says consumer protections for decarbonising homes must be fit for purpose. Costs:The coalition is calling for a comprehensive, long-term policy framework that provides certainty for businesses and consumers and which offers financial support such as grants, low-cost loans and financing. ""Our evidence is clear. Right now, making green changes to homes is too confusing and too often things go wrong for those trying to do the right thing,"" said Dame Clare Moriarty, chief executive of Citizens Advice. ""The public is behind the net zero transition, but they need the right information and tools, particularly when it comes to adapting their home. ""By getting things right now, the government can give people the confidence to make changes and play their part in getting to net zero."" A close up look at solar panels on a rooftop ""I think solar panels are a very good idea, especially for people who want to contribute to a cleaner environment."" That's the view of Michael, a homeowner in Liverpool who decided to ditch his gas heating for solar power a few years ago. All went well until his roof began to leak and damaged the ceiling in a bedroom. The first time it happened, the fitter repaired the problem. When it happened again in the same spot, Michael found the company had gone out of business. ""This trader had not been properly checked, I don't think they had a necessary qualification to be to be installing solar panels."" Despite an insurance scheme that was meant to help out in circumstances like this, Michael has been unable to get his roof fixed. ""There is no effective guarantee, no effective accountability and responsibility which should have been in place to stop all this happening,"" he said. In response to the letter, a government spokesperson said: ""We are investing Â£1.3bn this year alone to support people to install energy efficiency measures in their homes, with upgrades to 50,000 low-income households already underway. ""Our Simple Energy Advice service offers clear information on what financial support is available for people to make home improvements so they can save money on their energy bills."" In a separate study, the National Housing Federation said that England's homes produce more carbon emissions every year than all the country's cars. The Federation, which represents housing associations across England, says that the emissions from homes are so high because of gas central heating and poor insulation.

"Covid-19 has been mentioned on the death certificate of nearly 10,500 people in Scotland Scotland is to hold its own public inquiry into the handling of the Covid pandemic by the end of the year, the Scottish government has confirmed. The announcement follows pressure from relatives of some who have died. The inquiry will scrutinise decisions that were taken over the course of the crisis, with the aim of learning lessons for any future pandemics. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon had previously said her preference was for a UK-wide inquiry to be held. But Prime Minister Boris Johnson told MPs in May that an independent public inquiry examining the handling of the pandemic across all four UK nationswould not begin until the spring of next year, despite Ms Sturgeon calling for it to start this year. Warning over Covid restrictions as cases hit new high Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? Campaigners from the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group said a separate Scottish inquiry was needed to examine decisions made by the devolved Scottish government, and to hold it to account. Deputy First Minister John Swinney met representatives of the group shortly before the announcement was made. Almost 10,500 deaths have been registered in Scotland where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate since the pandemic began. The Scottish government is inviting people to give their views on the aims and principles of the public inquiry by 30 September. It said particular consideration would be given to the ""four harms"" of the pandemic: Direct health impacts of Covid-19, including cases and deaths in care homes Other non-Covid health impacts Societal impacts, including education Economic impacts It will also investigate ""events causing public concern"", for example thehigh number of deaths in care homes, and will examine the explanations of the decisions that were taken and the causes of ""anything which may not have gone as expected"". First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and former Health Secretary Jeane Freeman have both admitted that the way elderly people were discharged from hospitals into care homes at the start of the pandemic was a mistake. More than 1,300 elderly people were sent to care homes before a robust testing regime was in place. Ms Sturgeon told her Covid briefing on Tuesday: ""The inquiry will look at all matters related to the handling of the pandemic that are within our devolved competence. ""This will include of course the situation in our care homes."" Donald Macaskill, the chief executive of Scottish Care, the representative body for Scotland's independent care homes, told BBC Scotland the desire to protect the NHS did not appear to have included social care, which was treated as a second class citizen. He criticised the lack of planning and support with protective equipment (PPE) and said the inquiry needed to look at whether it was ""realistic"" to expect residential care homes to follow infection control procedures which were as stringent as an acute hospital setting. Asked if care homes would make financial pay-outs to the families of people who went into care homes Covid-free and died from the virus, Mr Macaskill said: ""I have no doubt that if there is culpability on the part of a care home provider then appropriate action will be taken - but if that culpability rests with government, with the NHS, with other parts of the system then I think that is a more fundamental question the inquiry will explore."" Ms Sturgeon has admitted that the way elderly people were discharged from hospital to care homes in the early stages of the pandemic was a mistake In her briefing, Ms Sturgeon stressed that the Scottish government would ""liaise closely"" with the UK government and the other devolved administrations on the likely terms of a UK wide inquiry to ""avoid duplication and overlap"". She added: ""The need for co-operation with other governments is not in my view a reason to delay the establishment of our own inquiry. ""I do believe a full public inquiry has an extremely important role to play, both in scrutinising the decisions that we took and indeed continue to take in the course of the pandemic, but also of course in identifying and learning appropriate lessons for the future."" The government said the announcement met its commitment to begin to take the necessary steps to establish a public inquiry within its first 100 days in office after the Holyrood election. Discussions are also under way to identify and appoint a judge to chair the inquiry. Solicitor Aamer Anwar, who is acting on behalf of members of Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice, welcomed the announcement but said the public inquiry must be truly independent and leave no stone unturned. And he said grieving families must be at the heart of the inquiry process if it is to be effective and meaningful. Mr Anwar also urged the prime minister to follow the Scottish government's lead and bring forward a UK-wide inquiry. Members of the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group welcomed the announcement at an event in Glasgow Peter McMahon, who lost his wife Debbie to coronavirus at the age of 53 from coronavirus, was one of the campaigners who watched the first minister announce the inquiry, which he said was ""very welcome"". He added: ""My wife Debbie, along with thousands of others, died what I see as an avoidable death. ""I would like this public inquiry to confirm who took certain decisions, clarify why they were taken, especially around the ending of shielding in July 2020."" Scottish Conservative health spokeswoman Annie Wells said the inquiry must uncover what went wrong throughout the pandemic, especially in care homes. She added: ""It's a disgrace that they are only getting around to this now, when Nicola Sturgeon promised it would be a priority during the election campaign. ""Major errors were made by the SNP government that left our most vulnerable citizens unprotected."" Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said the Scottish government had been ""dragging their feet, ignoring the pain of the grieving families and sacrifices of thousands of key workers"". He said: ""The first minister must end the dither and delay and act now so that light can be shone on the Scottish government's handling of the pandemic, lessons can be learned, and justice can be done."" Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Alex Cole-Hamilton said: ""Last summer, the Scottish government mismanaged quarantine and the return of students to campus allowing the virus to be re-seeded. Test and Protect was unprepared for the pressure of restrictions easing and tracing collapsed. People were discharged in their thousands from hospitals to care homes without tests or even after testing positive. ""This needs to be an avenue to accountability and responsibility for what happened in Scotland."" Scottish Greens co-leader Lorna Slater said: ""It's vital that the government's handling of the pandemic is subject to the most thorough scrutiny, and that's why this inquiry is so necessary. ""It's essential that we establish how the country could have been better prepared, and learn every lesson possible, to ensure we are in a better position to handle future public health crises."" It comes as the number of daily cases of the virus in Scotlandreached a new record high of 4,323on Tuesday, with Ms Sturgeon saying that she cannot rule out having to reintroduce ""limited and proportionate"" restrictions. The number of new cases has more than doubled over the past week, with Ms Sturgeon warning that the country was at another ""fragile and pivotal moment"" in the pandemic. A total of 364 people were in hospital on Monday with recently confirmed Covid-19, up by eight on the previous day, with 43 patients in intensive care, up two.

The news came weeks afterit was announcedthat Watts would miss the band's US tour dates to recover from an unspecified medical procedure. Watts was previously treated for throat cancer in 2004. Obituary: Charlie Watts In pictures: Look back at Charlie Watts' life He had been a member of the Stones since January 1963, when he joined Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and Brian Jones in their fledgling group. Watts helped them become, with The Beatles, one of the bands who took rock 'n' roll to the masses in the 60s with classics like (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction, Jumpin' Jack Flash, Get Off My Cloud and Sympathy for the Devil. Watts (centre) with his bandmates on stage in 1989 By BBC music reporter Mark Savage Charlie Watts was never the most flashy drummer. He wasn't known for the frenzied solos of Cream's Ginger Baker, or for placing explosives in his kick drum like The Who's Keith Moon. Instead, he was the subtle, stoic heartbeat of The Rolling Stones for almost 60 years. A jazz aficionado, he fell in love with the drums after listening to Chico Hamilton play brushes onWalking Shoes,external; and was only introduced to the dark arts of rock 'n' roll by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards in the early 1960s. He joined the Stones in 1963 after the band had discarded several other drummers - and they never looked back. ""Charlie Watts gives me the freedom to fly on stage,"" Richards later observed. His jazz-inflected swing gave the Stones' songs their swagger, pushing and pulling at the groove, creating room for Jagger's lascivious drawl. He was at his best on the cowbell-driven Honky Tonk Women or the locked-down groove Gimme Shelter (where he even threw in some uncharacteristically showy fills). On and off the stage, he was quiet and reserved - sticking to the shadows and letting the rest of the band suck up the limelight. ""I've actually never been interested in all that stuff and still am not,""he told the San Diego Tribune in 1991,external. ""I don't know what showbiz is and I've never watched MTV. There are people who just play instruments, and I'm pleased to know that I'm one of them."" The Stones, with Watts second right, had eight UK number one singles between 1964-69 Other tributes came from The Police drummerStewart Copeland,external, who described him as ""a unique, iconic drummer (and dancer)"", and Duran Duran's sticksmanRoger Taylor, who said,external""his simple style was a lesson to us all"".

"Shop worker Tracey Davies had said dealing with abuse every day was exhausting ""I've been spat at and was worried I might die of Covid."" Shop worker Tracey Davies said her depression flared back up after abuse from customers during the pandemic. Now the Welsh government and the shop worker's union is calling for greater protection for UK retail staff asnew laws come into force in Scotland. The Home Office said new guidelines meant courts should increase sentences for assaults against people providing a service to the public, like shop staff. Research from Usdaw, which represents 380,000 shop workers in the UK, suggests more than than 90% of their members had suffered abuse, more than two-thirds threatened, and one in seven assaulted. Shop worker abused 'every day for a year' Supermarkets shut off non-essential items in Wales Ms Davies, 51, from Neath, said while customers in her store had ""got a lot better"", abuse she received throughout the pandemic had triggered relapses in her depression. A union says its research suggested one in seven shop workers had been assaulted She said she received abuse from about five people every day. ""I was doing my regular job, a gentleman came in, I asked him for ID, he didn't have it so he proceeded to spit in my face in the middle of a pandemic."" She said she washed repeatedly as the incident made her feel ""violently ill"". The shop worker is calling on people to ""simply be kind"". ""That's all I'm asking. If everyone was kind, I wouldn't be in this mess."" Some shop staff have said they have been abused bycustomers while trying to enforce government face mask rules. Supermarket workers have also spoken out abouthaving to ""referee"" what could and could not be bought in shopsafter the Welsh government banned the sale of non-essential items like clothes, toys and electrical goods last year. One worker from mid Wales told an Usdaw survey they had been ""rammed with trolleys on purpose"" while one deaf worker in west Wales said customers had told them they should not be working. Some supermarket aisles were closed off during Wales' firebreak lockdown last year One supermarket giant revealed a 76% rise in reports of antisocial behaviour and verbal abuse towards its staff in 2020, withmore than 100 incidents at Co-op storesevery day. The Welsh government wants to follow the Scottish government's route and introduce tougher laws for perpetrators of abuse and violence towards shop staff but it is not a devolved power in Wales so is under the jurisdiction of Westminster. ""Any abuse directed at staff who are doing their job and helping to keep customers safe is completely unacceptable,"" said a Welsh government spokesperson. ""We support Usdaw's call for greater protections for shop workers, and with criminal justice currently reserved to the UK government, we urge them to bring forward the necessary legislation."" A law protecting shop workers would ""be amazing because we do mean something and we are important"", Jane Jones says Jane Jones, a checkout supervisor from Mold, said workers had ""always been abused"" but it had escalated since the pandemic began. The mother-of-two who has worked in retail for about 20 years said: ""You can be really anxious going to work. ""You're building yourself up to it before you go because you know what's coming."" Mrs Jones said that meant being sworn at, having items thrown at staff, and people moving closer to them when being asked to keep their distance. She said this had left colleagues reduced to tears and needing to take time off work due to stress and anxiety. Usdaw's general secretary called abuse against shop workers a ""disgrace"" Supermarket workers facing coronavirus 'abuse' Don't allow shop abuse to worsen, bosses tell PM ""It is heartbreaking to hear these testimonies from Welsh shop workers who deserve far more respect than they receive,"" said Paddy Lillis, Usdaw's general secretary. ""Our latest survey results clearly show the scale of the appalling violence, threats and abuse faced by shop workers and demonstrate the need for a 'protection of shop workers' law."" Linda Richards says the whole of the UK should have the same laws to protect shop workers As a union representative, Linda Richards said ""more and more people"" had come to her after suffering abusive treatment from some customers. She said the law introduced in Scotland should be the same ""across the board"". ""If you can't respect people, you should be held accountable for that."" The UK government said the Sentencing Council's revised assault guidelines were published in May and required courts to treat an offence committed against those working in the public sector or providing a service to the public as an aggravating factor, making the offence more serious. ""It is completely unacceptable to threaten or assault shop workers, not least when they are working so hard to keep vital services running,"" said a Home Office spokesperson. ""We are putting 20,000 extra police officers into our communities to cut crime - including retail crime - and we launched the Shop Kind campaign in April to provide better support to victims and encourage customers to treat shop workers with dignity and respect. ""The Sentencing Council has set out guidelines which means courts should increase sentences for assaults committed against all those providing a service to the public, which includes shop workers.""

Who might lead the Unite union and why it matters Unite to elect new leader by end of summer Gerard Coyne, the candidate seen as most sympathetic to Sir Keir Starmer, seems set to come third. Insiders are estimating that Ms Graham could have a majority of around 6,000 votes over Mr Turner, with Mr Coyne narrowly behind. The health warning is that the formal vote count only gets under way on Wednesday. But after ballots had been sorted in to respective piles, and extensively ""sampled"" to check for discrepancies, members of all three campaign teams that spoke to the BBC tonight expected a victory for Ms Graham. A fourth candidate, Howard Beckett,pulled out earlier in the contestand threw his support behind Mr Turner. Unite is the Labour Party's biggest trade union funder and, under Mr McCluskey, it strongly backed Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader. Mr McCluskey has been very critical of Sir Keir's tenure and has funded legal challenges to the party over suspensions and expulsions. Two Unite top job nominees warn on Labour funding Battle to succeed Unite's Len McCluskey heats up Although also on the Left, Ms Graham campaigned on putting more emphasis on the workplace, and far less on Westminster politics. Those who know her say she has little interest in Labour's internal wrangling. While Labour sources say they are relaxed about her expected win, she may still give them anxious moments. The union gave the party Â£3m in the run up to the 2019 election, but when I previously interviewed Ms Graham she said she wanted to see ""payment by results"". While she did not campaign explicitly on reducing contributions to Labour, she did say she would not give the party ""a blank cheque"". And party and union could soon be at loggerheads over job cuts at Labour's HQ. But it may be employers rather than Labour leaders who have the most to fear from her leadership. She told the BBC: ""Unashamedly, I am talking about jobs, pay and conditions as the number one, number two and number three priorities of the organisation."" She said she often gets involved in industrial disputes when they turn hostile, and puts some of her victories down to what is called ""leverage"", meaning applying pressure on multi-national companies to resolve sometimes local problems. For example, to help settle a dispute at a bus company in England she brought its behaviour to the notice of the Swedish government, putting the awarding of a potentially lucrative contract there at risk. Her likely victory was welcomed by left-wing campaign group Momentum, which praised ""the use of leverage to take on bad bosses"". Her ""back to the workplace"" message may have eaten in to some of Mr Coyne's support, as he also campaigned on less meddling in Labour's internal affairs. And with turnout expected to be even lower than the 12.2% achieved in the 2017 contest, those who are most active in the union are most likely to have voted. And many of them may have had direct experience of successful disputes led by Ms Graham. Her supporters say she is on the verge of a ""historic"" win. A spokesman for her campaign said: ""She has fought against the odds and triumphed. We were told she was a no-hoper, now it looks she has won. ""Unite workers have come behind her banner. It's time Unite went back to what it says on the trade union tin - fighting relentlessly for jobs, pay and conditions."" Last year, another huge union, Unison, elected its first female leader, Christine McAnea. There is certainly a change in style at the top of the union movement but it looks like there could also be a change of substance as Mr McCluskey's 11 year tenure at the top of Unite draws to a close.

Samantha Willis, 35, who had not been vaccinated for Covid-19, died on Friday after spending 16 days in hospital. The mother-of-four from Londonderry was buried on Monday after a service in which her new-born daughter child was baptised. ""We always thought we had 40 or more years together,"" her husband Josh Willis told BBC News NI. He said he thought they would have that time ""to share experiences and watch the wee ones grow up"".

"Visitors are also being encouraged to take lateral flow tests if they visit Cornwall Tourists have been urged to stay away from Cornwall unless they have pre-booked a trip because of a huge spike in Covid cases. The latest figures show Cornwall has770 cases per 100,000 people, double the previous week's figure. The UK also recorded 174 new Covid-related deaths on Tuesday - the highest figure since March. Malcolm Bell, head of Visit Cornwall, is calling on visitors to help keep the region safe. He said: ""We are asking people not to come unless they have booked ahead and request they take a lateral flow test before, during and after their stay so that people can be safe and help us to manage the current spike."" Mr Bell said the county had witnessed ""too many occurrences of overcrowding in honeypots"" - places thatattract mass tourism- and urged visitors to consider visiting less popular parts of Cornwall. ""We have over 300 beaches and lovely parts that can cope with visitors,"" he said. On Monday, Cornwall Council said4,700 cases may be linked to the Boardmasters festivalheld in Newquay. About 800 of those positive cases are people who live in Cornwall. Jack Stacey, from Staffordshire, told the BBC he caught Covid at Boardmasters and wished he had not gone. ""My whole family's got it now so I regret going to be honestâ¦ It wasn't worth it,"" he said. The 20-year-old, who is not vaccinated, said he was ""shocked"" at how ill the virus made him, leaving him bed-bound for nine days. Others were overjoyed at being able to party at a festival again. Festival organisers said in terms of Covid restrictions they ""went above and beyond what was asked of us"" Rosie Breakwell, 22, from Bath, said she also caught Covid there after receiving her first jab, but said she ""got over it pretty quickly"". ""I live for festivals so not having one in two years was just horrendous, and it was just so nice being back in a sweaty field with everyone,"" she said. Virologist Dr David Strain said music festivals were ""something that is important for mental health of a younger generation who have missed out on so much"". The lecturer at the University of Exeter Medical School said: ""It would have been nicer to have left it a month or so later so 17-18 year olds would have been double vaccinated."" But he said he ""probably would have made the same decision"" for it to go ahead. Dr Strain said 18-25 year olds had a ""very low risk of being hospitalised"" with coronavirus, but the ""real test"" of how the festival had impacted young people would be the number of long Covid cases that emerged. Analysis from Steve Holden, Newsbeat music reporter Boardmasters is a good reminder that just because large events are now allowed to take place, Covid-19 hasn't simply disappeared. As long as cases linked to festivals aren't landing people in hospital, making them seriously ill or putting pressure on the NHS, then organisers would argue the vaccination programme is reducing the public health risk. We're about to head into a bank holiday that is likely to be the busiest weekend of live music and festivals in the UK since the start of the pandemic. Thousands of people will be attending the likes of Reading and Leeds, Creamfields, Manchester Pride and All Points East in London and based on what's happened following Boardmasters, we can assume there will be a rise in cases linked to these events. By now, anyone attending knows there's going to be a risk of catching or spreading the virus when a large group of people share the same space. Festivals were ""core to the mental health of the younger generation"" said virologist Dr David Strain A condition of entry to Boardmasters was use of theNHS Covid Pass,external- a measure recommended as best-practiceÂ for other large events. Festival organisers said the systems they put in place meant more thanÂ 450 people were found to be at risk of passing on the virus ""and as a result did not attend our Watergate Bay site or left the festival early"". They said: ""We are grateful to them and everyone else who took the extra steps this year. ""No event is able to eliminate risk entirely. ""We look forward to sharing our experience with our local authority partners and other large events so we can all continue to provide much-needed economic benefit to our communities and entertainment to our loyal audiences."" In Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly there were 770 cases per 100,000 people in the seven days to 20 August. The figure for the previous week to 13 August was 384 cases per 100,000. Newquay's beaches have attracted tourists and surfers to the region Three parts of Newquaynow have the three highest Covid infection rates in Englandfor the seven days up to 18 August. The town's mayor, Lewis Gardner, said they had been working tirelessly ""all summer"" to keep Covid rates down. ""We've done vaccination pop-up centres, we've been handing out lateral flow tests, we've given advice to businesses,"" he told the BBC. ""And it just seems that everything we do, no matter what we do, the rates keep creeping up."" Follow BBC News South West onTwitter,external,Facebook,externalandInstagram,external.

"Despite numerous appeals, searches, arrests and interviews, Claudia Lawrence's case remains unsolved A popular fishing spot is being searched by police investigating the suspected murder of Claudia Lawrence. The 35-year-old's disappearance has remained a mystery since she failed to turn up for work at the University of York in March 2009. North Yorkshire Police said its latest search at Sand Hutton gravel pits, about eight miles (13km) outside York, was expected to take a number of days. The force said it could not disclose what had led officers to the location. Det Supt Wayne Fox, who took over as senior investigating officer in the case earlier this year, said teams of specialist officers, including underwater search teams, would spend several days at the site. He said the searches were among ""several active lines of inquiry"" being pursued amid efforts to establish what happened to Claudia and ""identify any person responsible for causing her harm"". Ms Lawrence's family had been notified about the search, he added. What happened to Claudia Lawrence? More from Yorkshire The former gravel pits at Sand Hutton sit to the north-east of York, close to the busy A64. Popular with anglers, the site is believed to have been used as fishing ponds since the late 1960s. Police cordoned off a large section of woodland surrounding the waters on Tuesday as officers searched undergrowth along a public bridleway which runs through the area. The search is expected to last a number of days, police said University chef Ms Lawrence was last seen at 15.05 on Wednesday 18 March walking towards her home on Heworth Road. Later that evening she spoke to both her parents, Joan and Peter Lawrence, by phone, but the following day failed to arrive for her job at Goodricke College. A friend who became concerned when she failed to meet at a local pub that evening contacted Ms Lawrence's father, who reported her missing on 20 March. The Sand Hutton gravel pits lie in woodland north-east of York In April 2009, police confirmed they were treating her disappearance as a case of suspected murder. Nine people have been questioned in connection with her disappearance, but no charges have ever been brought. North Yorkshire Police said the investigation had been difficult because Ms Lawrence did not use social media or own a smartphone. The force scaled back its investigation in 2017, however it said it would investigate any fresh lead or evidence in the case. Peter Lawrence, seen here on the 10th anniversary of his daughter's disappearance, died in February Ms Lawrence's father, Peter, died in February without finding out what had happened to his daughter. The 74-year-old had lobbied for a change in the law, which came into force in 2019, to allow relatives to take control of their missing loved ones' financial affairs. Mr Lawrence was appointed an OBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours in 2018 in recognition of his campaigning. Follow BBC Yorkshire onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external.

The news came weeks afterit was announcedthat Watts would miss the band's US tour dates to recover from an unspecified medical procedure. Watts was previously treated for throat cancer in 2004. Obituary: Charlie Watts In pictures: Look back at Charlie Watts' life He had been a member of the Stones since January 1963, when he joined Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and Brian Jones in their fledgling group. Watts helped them become, with The Beatles, one of the bands who took rock 'n' roll to the masses in the 60s with classics like (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction, Jumpin' Jack Flash, Get Off My Cloud and Sympathy for the Devil. Watts (centre) with his bandmates on stage in 1989 By BBC music reporter Mark Savage Charlie Watts was never the most flashy drummer. He wasn't known for the frenzied solos of Cream's Ginger Baker, or for placing explosives in his kick drum like The Who's Keith Moon. Instead, he was the subtle, stoic heartbeat of The Rolling Stones for almost 60 years. A jazz aficionado, he fell in love with the drums after listening to Chico Hamilton play brushes onWalking Shoes,external; and was only introduced to the dark arts of rock 'n' roll by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards in the early 1960s. He joined the Stones in 1963 after the band had discarded several other drummers - and they never looked back. ""Charlie Watts gives me the freedom to fly on stage,"" Richards later observed. His jazz-inflected swing gave the Stones' songs their swagger, pushing and pulling at the groove, creating room for Jagger's lascivious drawl. He was at his best on the cowbell-driven Honky Tonk Women or the locked-down groove Gimme Shelter (where he even threw in some uncharacteristically showy fills). On and off the stage, he was quiet and reserved - sticking to the shadows and letting the rest of the band suck up the limelight. ""I've actually never been interested in all that stuff and still am not,""he told the San Diego Tribune in 1991,external. ""I don't know what showbiz is and I've never watched MTV. There are people who just play instruments, and I'm pleased to know that I'm one of them."" The Stones, with Watts second right, had eight UK number one singles between 1964-69 Other tributes came from The Police drummerStewart Copeland,external, who described him as ""a unique, iconic drummer (and dancer)"", and Duran Duran's sticksmanRoger Taylor, who said,external""his simple style was a lesson to us all"".

"The family was staying in a static caravan at the Sealands park near Skegness A two-year-old girl has died in a fire at a seaside caravan park. The blaze broke out in a static unit at Sealands caravan park in Ingoldmells, near Skegness, on Monday night. Lincolnshire Police said the girl's mother and three siblings managed to escape the blaze and have since been released from hospital. Det Insp Jo Fortune said investigations were at an early stage and the cause of the fire was not yet clear. She said teams would be working to piece together the circumstances of the ""particularly harrowing"" case over the coming days. Lincolnshire Fire and Rescue Service said the fire was ""well established"" when crews arrived. More on this and other news across Lincolnshire About 50 people from nearby caravans were evacuated to emergency accommodation set up by site owner Laver Leisure. A holidaymaker said the fire took hold of the caravan ""very fast"" One holidaymaker from Bedfordshire, who gave his name as Nigel, described how quickly the fire took hold. ""It went from being a small glow to being a massive inferno and by the time the fire brigade turned up, you could see that the shell of the caravan had gone."" The force has appealed for any witnesses or people with footage of the fire to contact them. Sealands is a coastal caravan park offering rentals to holidaymakers Sealands is a coastal holiday home site with 263 static home plots, many of which can be rented.

"England and Wales record highest number of weekly Covid-related deaths since March - ONS First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says Scotland is at a ""fragile and pivotal"" moment in the pandemic She says 'limited and proportionate' restrictions could be reintroduced Scots are being asked for views on an independent inquiry into the handling of the pandemic Retail leaders are urging the UK government to follow Scotland's example in extending new protections for shop workers Breast milk of mothers who have had Covid-19 vaccines has significant level of antibodies - study Covid cases have risen sharply in French Polynesia, which is largely unvaccinated Edited by Paul Gribben We're now bringing our live page to a close for today. We'll be back with another live page on Wednesday. Our writers were Alex Therrien and Katie Wright. The page was edited by Paul Gribben We'll soon be bringing our live page to a pause for today. But before we do, here is a recap of the main coronavirus stories from today.  It is up to individual areas if they want to require visitors to take a Covid test before entering, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden has told the BBC. Cumbriaâs director of public health has called forpeople to ensure they test negative before holidaying in the area, and those travelling to the Lincolnshire coast are now being encouraged to do the same. Asked about this by the BBC while on a visit to Northern Ireland, Mr Dowden responded:  âOf course itâs up to individual areas what further precautions they take. ""But the key thing is, get that jab. That will enable people to have wonderful holidays just like the ones Iâve seen people having here"". Experienced staff will leave the NHS sooner than they might have if the government does not come up with a plan for the health service's recovery from the pandemic and its future, a senior health leader has warned. The president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine said she is ""genuinely not confident"" the government has a plan for the NHS, which is facing rising waiting lists and continued pressure from coronavirus cases. Dr Katherine Henderson said there must be a plan in the short term to manage public expectations and give staff a vision on ""somewhere that we're going"" and a longer term outline of how to resource the health service to provide the care people expect. If this does not happen soon, the most experienced people who are approaching retirement but are ""holding a lot of stuff together"" will ""bail out"", she said. She told the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Coronavirus: ""We can't limp from investigation to investigation, to criticism, to yet another scandal where workforce comes down to being the primary problem. ""We don't have enough people able to deliver the standard of care that we believe the NHS ought to be able to do."" She said while younger people will always come into the NHS, there will be employees with years of experience ""who will leave sooner than they should"". Tourists are being asked to stay away from Cornwall unless they have pre-booked their trip, the region's tourist board has warned. The South West has seen a recent spike in Covid-19 cases across Devon and Cornwall. The latest figures show Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly have 717 cases per 100,000 people. Malcolm Bell, head of Visit Cornwall, is calling on visitors to help keep the region safe. He said the county had witnessed ""too many occurrences of overcrowding in honey pots"" and urged visitors to consider visiting less popular parts.
""We have over 300 beaches and lovely parts that can cope with visitors,"" he said. Read morehere. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst China has recorded only one domestic coronavirus case today, and papers are lauding the success of the country reversing a widespread outbreak of the Delta variant. In mid-July, multiple workers at an international airport in Nanjing tested positive with the virus. By early August, the number of daily cases nationwide had reached triple digits, and official media said that cases had been detected in at least 17 of Chinaâs 31 provincial-level regions. Regional governments responded to this by instantly locking down communities where cases of the virus had been detected, and imposing travel restrictions. There were multiple rounds of city-wide Covid-19 tests in multiple cities to identify if neighbours and close contacts of confirmed cases were asymptomatic. The nationalGlobal Times,externalnewspaper said that the outbreak was regarded as the most widespread since the original Covid-19 outbreak in Wuhan, at the beginning of 2020. However, on Sunday, the National Health Commission said that the country hadrecorded zero confirmed cases,externalâfor the first time in over a monthâ, 35 days since the first case had been detected. The lockdown and mass-test approach has been somewhat routine in China, and the Xinhua News Agency says that âthis strategy has proven effective in rapidly controlling more than 20 imported outbreaksâ. China knows, however, that it canât lock down forever. Ithopes to reopen to the world by early 2022,external, provided that at least 80% of its 1.4 billion population are fully vaccinated. The breast milk of mothers who have had Covid-19 vaccines contains a significant level of antibodies that may help protect nursing babies from the virus, a small study suggests. When babies are born, their underdeveloped immune systems make it hard for them to fight infections on their own. They are also often too young to respond adequately to certain types of vaccines, experts say. For this study researchers recruited 21 lactating healthcare workers who had never contracted the virus. They sampled the mothers' breast milk and blood three times - before vaccination, after the first dose and after the second dose. There was a robust antibody response in blood and breast milk after the second dose - about a hundred-fold increase compared with levels before vaccination - the study found. Joseph Larkin III, senior author of the study and an associate professor at the University of Florida, said: ""Our findings show that vaccination results in a significant increase in antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 - the virus that causes Covid-19 - in breast milk, suggesting that vaccinated mothers can pass on this immunity to their babies, something we are working to confirm in our ongoing research.""  The daily figures released by the government are one of the ways Covid deaths are measured As we have been reporting, the latest ONS figures suggest coronavirus-related deaths in England and Wales in the week ending 13 August were at their highest levels since late March. The ONS counts deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate, even if the person had not been tested for the virus. By this measurement there have been 156,958 deaths since the pandemic began. Because death certificates take time to be registered, these figures are several weeks old by the time they are released. The other main way coronavirus deaths are counted is in the UK government's daily figures, which count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. By this measurement there have been 131,680 deaths. There is also a bit of a lag in these figures, although they are more up to date than the ONS data so are monitored by healthcare experts, scientists and politicians to help them decide on their next steps. The daily deaths figures have been growing even higher since the period covered by the ONS stats released today, with deaths now averaging above 100 a day over the past week. The daily figure will next be updated at 16:00 BST. Of course, talk of Scotland's intention to hold a public inquiry this year into how the pandemic has been handled in Scotland promots the queston of when the UK-wide independent public inquiry already announced by Boris Johnson will actually start. Scotland First Minister Nicola Sturgeon stressed that the Scottish government would ""liaise closely"" with the UK government and the other devolved administrations on the likely terms of a UK-wide inquiry to ""avoid duplication and overlap"". The prime minister has said he intends to launch the UK inquiry in spring 2022 - and has resisted calls to bring it forward. Earlier this year, Labour called for it to start this summer - but that was before the third wave of Covid took hold. And England's deputy chief medical officer, Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, has said that requiring medical experts and front-line workers to attend an inquiry at a time when Covid is still so prevalent would be ""an extra burden that wasn't necessary"". The exact aims and remit of the inquiry - known as the terms of reference - will be announced closer to the start of the inquiry next year. This is partly to allow time for the UK government to work with the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland on deciding its exact scope. Read more about how the UK inquiry will workhere. Covid has been mentioned on the death certificate of nearly 10,500 people in Scotland Here is what we know about Scotland's plans to hold its own public inquiry into the handling of the Covid pandemic: Samantha Willis died two weeks after giving birth Pregnant women are being urged to get vaccinated after a woman from Northern Ireland died with Covid-19 two weeks after giving birth. The funeral of Samantha Willis was held on Monday.The mother-of-four died in intensive care on Friday, after spending 16 days in hospital with Covid-19. Dr David Farren, an infection control doctor, said hospitals were now ""constantly"" seeing pregnant women with Covid. Speaking to BBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster programme, Dr Farren said: ""Now the majority do well but we do see occasionally people ending up in intensive care, having to have their babies delivered early and last week we saw a tragic death."" ""Enough's enough. Pregnant women need to get their vaccine,"" he said. Dr Farren said he could understand the initial hesitancy of pregnant women to get vaccinated because there had been ""mixed messages"". However, he added: ""People need to start trusting their doctors, their midwives, their nurses and not listening to people who have spent 30 minutes on the internet and decided it's not safe."" Read morehere. Eden's case rate has doubled over the last week A plea to visitors to take lateral flow tests before coming to Cumbria may have an impact on bookings at a ""crucial time"", a tourism chief has warned. The area's director of public health Colin Cox said tourists should ensure they were virus-free as a ""courtesy"" after a spike of cases in Eden. Alison Magee-Barker, who works with tourism and hospitality firms, said asking visitors to take tests could result in a loss of business. She said: ""Potentially it could put people off and we're coming up to a winter season where we really fight for guests. ""We've had such a hard time in the hospitality industry over the last 18 months with restrictions and guidelines. This could be another nail in the coffin."" Read morehere. About 600,000 young Scots will be able to get dental care free of charge, as the Scottish Government has pledged more cash to help that sector recover from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Dentists are to get a further Â£7.5m of funding, with the government cash allowing practices to buy new drills, which do not generate as much aerosol as standard drills, reducing the risks of spreading Covid-19. The funding was announced at the same time as Health Secretary Humza Yousaf confirmed all those under the age of 26 are now eligible for free dental care. Nicola Sturgeon is taking questions from journalists, and she is asked what impact schools and universities returning will have on Covid cases in Scotland and the NHS. The first minister says there are less hospitalisations currently - adding that when cases are high, a small percentage of those cases will still result in a large number of people becoming seriously ill. She also says the NHS is trying to return to normal so the margins of tolerance to deal with Covid are smaller than at the start of the pandemic when hospitals were cleared to deal with the virus. She adds that it will take less for the NHS to face significant pressures. Sturgeon says the vaccine is providing a shield but the virus is still trying ""to beat us"". ""I don't underestimate how difficult this is but nobody can wave a magic wand and make it all go away,"" she says. Scotland's first minister says there has been a ""sharp rise"" in cases with new cases more than doubling over the past week. Nicola Sturgeon says it is one of the sharpest rises the country has experienced at any point during the pandemic. ""Today's figure is the largest recorded in a single day though it is worth remembering that we do more testing now than was the case in the early stages of the pandemic,"" she says. She says that if the surge continues and accelerates and there is an increase in serious illness, she cannot rule out having to re-impose some restrictions. However, the first minister says she hopes not to have to do that and, if she does, the restrictions will be as limited and proportionate as possible. The country is at another ""fragile and pivotal moment"" in the pandemic, she adds. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is holding her coronavirus update. She begins by going through Tuesday's coronavirus figures. The first minister says there were 4,323 cases reported on Monday - the equivalent of 14.5% of all tests carried out. She says 364 people are in hospital - a rise of eight since yesterday and 43 people are in intensive care, two more than on Monday. A further 10 deaths have been recorded - that takes the total number of deaths registered under this daily measurement to 8,080. As of this morning 4,085,552 people have received one dose while 3,587,145 have received both doses. Around 80% of over-18s have now had both doses - and 95% of over-40s. She says these are ""genuinely remarkable"" figures. A statement on behalf of members of the Scottish branch of the UK group Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice welcomed the Scottish government's plans for a Covid inquiry. It says: ""The families are grateful that the Scottish government has listened to their demands and an independent Scottish public inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the deaths and the subsequent handling of the Covid pandemic will now take place."" It adds: ""Today is the first important step in establishing accountability for 10,421 lives lost to Covid-19 in Scotland."" It says that the core priority is to get the public inquiry up and running by the end of this calendar year. Scots are being asked for their views on an independent inquiry into the handling of the coronavirus pandemic. The Scottish government says it will be established by the end of the year to look at decisions and learn lessons for future pandemics. Particular consideration will be given to cases and deaths in care homes, the impact on education and the economy. The public are being encouraged to share their ideas and comments on email by 30 September. Deputy First Minister John Swinney said discussions were also ongoing with the UK government on the planned four nations inquiry. Read more detailshere. Long Covid patients in north Wales are helping the area's health board tailor a wide range of treatments to support fellow sufferers. Long Covid is defined as symptoms continuing for more than 12 weeks after an initial infection. About 15% of Covid patients are thought to be affected and, while not all will need ongoing treatment, many will. The Long Recovery Programme Group will feature regular meetings between staff and patients at Betsi Cadwaladr Health Board to hear first-hand accounts of health problems. One 38-year-old health worker now needs crutches to walk nearly 18 months after she first contracted Covid. Read morehere. The population of the Pacific territory of French Polynesia is largely unvaccinated Covid infections are soaring in the sparsely-populated Pacific territory of French Polynesia, with health authorities reporting 54 deaths from the virus over the weekend as the Delta variant spreads among a largely unvaccinated population. More than 300 people have died from Covid-19 since the pandemic hit the remote archipelago, home to 280,000 inhabitants. More than half of those deaths have come in the last three weeks. The territory has so far recorded 7,591 infections, although the true figure is likely to be higher as most asymptomatic people are not being tested. High rates of diabetes and obesity have made the population more vulnerable. The territory's limited health care system has struggled to cope, with one major hospital setting up beds in hallways to handle the rising number of patients. Bodies have been loaded onto refrigerator trucks to relieve pressure on the overwhelmed morgue. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Visitors are also being encouraged to take lateral flow tests if they visit Cornwall Tourists have been urged to stay away from Cornwall unless they have pre-booked a trip because of a huge spike in Covid cases. The latest figures show Cornwall has770 cases per 100,000 people, double the previous week's figure. The UK also recorded 174 new Covid-related deaths on Tuesday - the highest figure since March. Malcolm Bell, head of Visit Cornwall, is calling on visitors to help keep the region safe. He said: ""We are asking people not to come unless they have booked ahead and request they take a lateral flow test before, during and after their stay so that people can be safe and help us to manage the current spike."" Mr Bell said the county had witnessed ""too many occurrences of overcrowding in honeypots"" - places thatattract mass tourism- and urged visitors to consider visiting less popular parts of Cornwall. ""We have over 300 beaches and lovely parts that can cope with visitors,"" he said. On Monday, Cornwall Council said4,700 cases may be linked to the Boardmasters festivalheld in Newquay. About 800 of those positive cases are people who live in Cornwall. Jack Stacey, from Staffordshire, told the BBC he caught Covid at Boardmasters and wished he had not gone. ""My whole family's got it now so I regret going to be honestâ¦ It wasn't worth it,"" he said. The 20-year-old, who is not vaccinated, said he was ""shocked"" at how ill the virus made him, leaving him bed-bound for nine days. Others were overjoyed at being able to party at a festival again. Festival organisers said in terms of Covid restrictions they ""went above and beyond what was asked of us"" Rosie Breakwell, 22, from Bath, said she also caught Covid there after receiving her first jab, but said she ""got over it pretty quickly"". ""I live for festivals so not having one in two years was just horrendous, and it was just so nice being back in a sweaty field with everyone,"" she said. Virologist Dr David Strain said music festivals were ""something that is important for mental health of a younger generation who have missed out on so much"". The lecturer at the University of Exeter Medical School said: ""It would have been nicer to have left it a month or so later so 17-18 year olds would have been double vaccinated."" But he said he ""probably would have made the same decision"" for it to go ahead. Dr Strain said 18-25 year olds had a ""very low risk of being hospitalised"" with coronavirus, but the ""real test"" of how the festival had impacted young people would be the number of long Covid cases that emerged. Analysis from Steve Holden, Newsbeat music reporter Boardmasters is a good reminder that just because large events are now allowed to take place, Covid-19 hasn't simply disappeared. As long as cases linked to festivals aren't landing people in hospital, making them seriously ill or putting pressure on the NHS, then organisers would argue the vaccination programme is reducing the public health risk. We're about to head into a bank holiday that is likely to be the busiest weekend of live music and festivals in the UK since the start of the pandemic. Thousands of people will be attending the likes of Reading and Leeds, Creamfields, Manchester Pride and All Points East in London and based on what's happened following Boardmasters, we can assume there will be a rise in cases linked to these events. By now, anyone attending knows there's going to be a risk of catching or spreading the virus when a large group of people share the same space. Festivals were ""core to the mental health of the younger generation"" said virologist Dr David Strain A condition of entry to Boardmasters was use of theNHS Covid Pass,external- a measure recommended as best-practiceÂ for other large events. Festival organisers said the systems they put in place meant more thanÂ 450 people were found to be at risk of passing on the virus ""and as a result did not attend our Watergate Bay site or left the festival early"". They said: ""We are grateful to them and everyone else who took the extra steps this year. ""No event is able to eliminate risk entirely. ""We look forward to sharing our experience with our local authority partners and other large events so we can all continue to provide much-needed economic benefit to our communities and entertainment to our loyal audiences."" In Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly there were 770 cases per 100,000 people in the seven days to 20 August. The figure for the previous week to 13 August was 384 cases per 100,000. Newquay's beaches have attracted tourists and surfers to the region Three parts of Newquaynow have the three highest Covid infection rates in Englandfor the seven days up to 18 August. The town's mayor, Lewis Gardner, said they had been working tirelessly ""all summer"" to keep Covid rates down. ""We've done vaccination pop-up centres, we've been handing out lateral flow tests, we've given advice to businesses,"" he told the BBC. ""And it just seems that everything we do, no matter what we do, the rates keep creeping up."" Follow BBC News South West onTwitter,external,Facebook,externalandInstagram,external.

"Visitors are also being encouraged to take lateral flow tests if they visit Cornwall Tourists have been urged to stay away from Cornwall unless they have pre-booked a trip because of a huge spike in Covid cases. The latest figures show Cornwall has770 cases per 100,000 people, double the previous week's figure. The UK also recorded 174 new Covid-related deaths on Tuesday - the highest figure since March. Malcolm Bell, head of Visit Cornwall, is calling on visitors to help keep the region safe. He said: ""We are asking people not to come unless they have booked ahead and request they take a lateral flow test before, during and after their stay so that people can be safe and help us to manage the current spike."" Mr Bell said the county had witnessed ""too many occurrences of overcrowding in honeypots"" - places thatattract mass tourism- and urged visitors to consider visiting less popular parts of Cornwall. ""We have over 300 beaches and lovely parts that can cope with visitors,"" he said. On Monday, Cornwall Council said4,700 cases may be linked to the Boardmasters festivalheld in Newquay. About 800 of those positive cases are people who live in Cornwall. Jack Stacey, from Staffordshire, told the BBC he caught Covid at Boardmasters and wished he had not gone. ""My whole family's got it now so I regret going to be honestâ¦ It wasn't worth it,"" he said. The 20-year-old, who is not vaccinated, said he was ""shocked"" at how ill the virus made him, leaving him bed-bound for nine days. Others were overjoyed at being able to party at a festival again. Festival organisers said in terms of Covid restrictions they ""went above and beyond what was asked of us"" Rosie Breakwell, 22, from Bath, said she also caught Covid there after receiving her first jab, but said she ""got over it pretty quickly"". ""I live for festivals so not having one in two years was just horrendous, and it was just so nice being back in a sweaty field with everyone,"" she said. Virologist Dr David Strain said music festivals were ""something that is important for mental health of a younger generation who have missed out on so much"". The lecturer at the University of Exeter Medical School said: ""It would have been nicer to have left it a month or so later so 17-18 year olds would have been double vaccinated."" But he said he ""probably would have made the same decision"" for it to go ahead. Dr Strain said 18-25 year olds had a ""very low risk of being hospitalised"" with coronavirus, but the ""real test"" of how the festival had impacted young people would be the number of long Covid cases that emerged. Analysis from Steve Holden, Newsbeat music reporter Boardmasters is a good reminder that just because large events are now allowed to take place, Covid-19 hasn't simply disappeared. As long as cases linked to festivals aren't landing people in hospital, making them seriously ill or putting pressure on the NHS, then organisers would argue the vaccination programme is reducing the public health risk. We're about to head into a bank holiday that is likely to be the busiest weekend of live music and festivals in the UK since the start of the pandemic. Thousands of people will be attending the likes of Reading and Leeds, Creamfields, Manchester Pride and All Points East in London and based on what's happened following Boardmasters, we can assume there will be a rise in cases linked to these events. By now, anyone attending knows there's going to be a risk of catching or spreading the virus when a large group of people share the same space. Festivals were ""core to the mental health of the younger generation"" said virologist Dr David Strain A condition of entry to Boardmasters was use of theNHS Covid Pass,external- a measure recommended as best-practiceÂ for other large events. Festival organisers said the systems they put in place meant more thanÂ 450 people were found to be at risk of passing on the virus ""and as a result did not attend our Watergate Bay site or left the festival early"". They said: ""We are grateful to them and everyone else who took the extra steps this year. ""No event is able to eliminate risk entirely. ""We look forward to sharing our experience with our local authority partners and other large events so we can all continue to provide much-needed economic benefit to our communities and entertainment to our loyal audiences.""

"England and Wales record highest number of weekly Covid-related deaths since March - ONS First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says Scotland is at a ""fragile and pivotal"" moment in the pandemic She says 'limited and proportionate' restrictions could be reintroduced Scots are being asked for views on an independent inquiry into the handling of the pandemic Retail leaders are urging the UK government to follow Scotland's example in extending new protections for shop workers Breast milk of mothers who have had Covid-19 vaccines has significant level of antibodies - study Covid cases have risen sharply in French Polynesia, which is largely unvaccinated Edited by Paul Gribben We're now bringing our live page to a close for today. We'll be back with another live page on Wednesday. Our writers were Alex Therrien and Katie Wright. The page was edited by Paul Gribben We'll soon be bringing our live page to a pause for today. But before we do, here is a recap of the main coronavirus stories from today.  It is up to individual areas if they want to require visitors to take a Covid test before entering, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden has told the BBC. Cumbriaâs director of public health has called forpeople to ensure they test negative before holidaying in the area, and those travelling to the Lincolnshire coast are now being encouraged to do the same. Asked about this by the BBC while on a visit to Northern Ireland, Mr Dowden responded:  âOf course itâs up to individual areas what further precautions they take. ""But the key thing is, get that jab. That will enable people to have wonderful holidays just like the ones Iâve seen people having here"". Experienced staff will leave the NHS sooner than they might have if the government does not come up with a plan for the health service's recovery from the pandemic and its future, a senior health leader has warned. The president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine said she is ""genuinely not confident"" the government has a plan for the NHS, which is facing rising waiting lists and continued pressure from coronavirus cases. Dr Katherine Henderson said there must be a plan in the short term to manage public expectations and give staff a vision on ""somewhere that we're going"" and a longer term outline of how to resource the health service to provide the care people expect. If this does not happen soon, the most experienced people who are approaching retirement but are ""holding a lot of stuff together"" will ""bail out"", she said. She told the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Coronavirus: ""We can't limp from investigation to investigation, to criticism, to yet another scandal where workforce comes down to being the primary problem. ""We don't have enough people able to deliver the standard of care that we believe the NHS ought to be able to do."" She said while younger people will always come into the NHS, there will be employees with years of experience ""who will leave sooner than they should"". Tourists are being asked to stay away from Cornwall unless they have pre-booked their trip, the region's tourist board has warned. The South West has seen a recent spike in Covid-19 cases across Devon and Cornwall. The latest figures show Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly have 717 cases per 100,000 people. Malcolm Bell, head of Visit Cornwall, is calling on visitors to help keep the region safe. He said the county had witnessed ""too many occurrences of overcrowding in honey pots"" and urged visitors to consider visiting less popular parts.
""We have over 300 beaches and lovely parts that can cope with visitors,"" he said. Read morehere. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst China has recorded only one domestic coronavirus case today, and papers are lauding the success of the country reversing a widespread outbreak of the Delta variant. In mid-July, multiple workers at an international airport in Nanjing tested positive with the virus. By early August, the number of daily cases nationwide had reached triple digits, and official media said that cases had been detected in at least 17 of Chinaâs 31 provincial-level regions. Regional governments responded to this by instantly locking down communities where cases of the virus had been detected, and imposing travel restrictions. There were multiple rounds of city-wide Covid-19 tests in multiple cities to identify if neighbours and close contacts of confirmed cases were asymptomatic. The nationalGlobal Times,externalnewspaper said that the outbreak was regarded as the most widespread since the original Covid-19 outbreak in Wuhan, at the beginning of 2020. However, on Sunday, the National Health Commission said that the country hadrecorded zero confirmed cases,externalâfor the first time in over a monthâ, 35 days since the first case had been detected. The lockdown and mass-test approach has been somewhat routine in China, and the Xinhua News Agency says that âthis strategy has proven effective in rapidly controlling more than 20 imported outbreaksâ. China knows, however, that it canât lock down forever. Ithopes to reopen to the world by early 2022,external, provided that at least 80% of its 1.4 billion population are fully vaccinated. The breast milk of mothers who have had Covid-19 vaccines contains a significant level of antibodies that may help protect nursing babies from the virus, a small study suggests. When babies are born, their underdeveloped immune systems make it hard for them to fight infections on their own. They are also often too young to respond adequately to certain types of vaccines, experts say. For this study researchers recruited 21 lactating healthcare workers who had never contracted the virus. They sampled the mothers' breast milk and blood three times - before vaccination, after the first dose and after the second dose. There was a robust antibody response in blood and breast milk after the second dose - about a hundred-fold increase compared with levels before vaccination - the study found. Joseph Larkin III, senior author of the study and an associate professor at the University of Florida, said: ""Our findings show that vaccination results in a significant increase in antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 - the virus that causes Covid-19 - in breast milk, suggesting that vaccinated mothers can pass on this immunity to their babies, something we are working to confirm in our ongoing research.""  The daily figures released by the government are one of the ways Covid deaths are measured As we have been reporting, the latest ONS figures suggest coronavirus-related deaths in England and Wales in the week ending 13 August were at their highest levels since late March. The ONS counts deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate, even if the person had not been tested for the virus. By this measurement there have been 156,958 deaths since the pandemic began. Because death certificates take time to be registered, these figures are several weeks old by the time they are released. The other main way coronavirus deaths are counted is in the UK government's daily figures, which count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. By this measurement there have been 131,680 deaths. There is also a bit of a lag in these figures, although they are more up to date than the ONS data so are monitored by healthcare experts, scientists and politicians to help them decide on their next steps. The daily deaths figures have been growing even higher since the period covered by the ONS stats released today, with deaths now averaging above 100 a day over the past week. The daily figure will next be updated at 16:00 BST. Of course, talk of Scotland's intention to hold a public inquiry this year into how the pandemic has been handled in Scotland promots the queston of when the UK-wide independent public inquiry already announced by Boris Johnson will actually start. Scotland First Minister Nicola Sturgeon stressed that the Scottish government would ""liaise closely"" with the UK government and the other devolved administrations on the likely terms of a UK-wide inquiry to ""avoid duplication and overlap"". The prime minister has said he intends to launch the UK inquiry in spring 2022 - and has resisted calls to bring it forward. Earlier this year, Labour called for it to start this summer - but that was before the third wave of Covid took hold. And England's deputy chief medical officer, Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, has said that requiring medical experts and front-line workers to attend an inquiry at a time when Covid is still so prevalent would be ""an extra burden that wasn't necessary"". The exact aims and remit of the inquiry - known as the terms of reference - will be announced closer to the start of the inquiry next year. This is partly to allow time for the UK government to work with the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland on deciding its exact scope. Read more about how the UK inquiry will workhere. Covid has been mentioned on the death certificate of nearly 10,500 people in Scotland Here is what we know about Scotland's plans to hold its own public inquiry into the handling of the Covid pandemic: Samantha Willis died two weeks after giving birth Pregnant women are being urged to get vaccinated after a woman from Northern Ireland died with Covid-19 two weeks after giving birth. The funeral of Samantha Willis was held on Monday.The mother-of-four died in intensive care on Friday, after spending 16 days in hospital with Covid-19. Dr David Farren, an infection control doctor, said hospitals were now ""constantly"" seeing pregnant women with Covid. Speaking to BBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster programme, Dr Farren said: ""Now the majority do well but we do see occasionally people ending up in intensive care, having to have their babies delivered early and last week we saw a tragic death."" ""Enough's enough. Pregnant women need to get their vaccine,"" he said. Dr Farren said he could understand the initial hesitancy of pregnant women to get vaccinated because there had been ""mixed messages"". However, he added: ""People need to start trusting their doctors, their midwives, their nurses and not listening to people who have spent 30 minutes on the internet and decided it's not safe.""

Eden's case rate has doubled over the last week A plea to visitors to take lateral flow tests before coming to Cumbria may have an impact on bookings at a ""crucial time"", a tourism chief has warned. The area's director of public health Colin Cox said tourists should ensure they were virus-free as a ""courtesy"" after a spike of cases in Eden. Alison Magee-Barker, who works with tourism and hospitality firms, said asking visitors to take tests could result in a loss of business. She said: ""Potentially it could put people off and we're coming up to a winter season where we really fight for guests. ""We've had such a hard time in the hospitality industry over the last 18 months with restrictions and guidelines. This could be another nail in the coffin."" Read morehere. About 600,000 young Scots will be able to get dental care free of charge, as the Scottish Government has pledged more cash to help that sector recover from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Dentists are to get a further Â£7.5m of funding, with the government cash allowing practices to buy new drills, which do not generate as much aerosol as standard drills, reducing the risks of spreading Covid-19. The funding was announced at the same time as Health Secretary Humza Yousaf confirmed all those under the age of 26 are now eligible for free dental care. Nicola Sturgeon is taking questions from journalists, and she is asked what impact schools and universities returning will have on Covid cases in Scotland and the NHS. The first minister says there are less hospitalisations currently - adding that when cases are high, a small percentage of those cases will still result in a large number of people becoming seriously ill. She also says the NHS is trying to return to normal so the margins of tolerance to deal with Covid are smaller than at the start of the pandemic when hospitals were cleared to deal with the virus. She adds that it will take less for the NHS to face significant pressures. Sturgeon says the vaccine is providing a shield but the virus is still trying ""to beat us"". ""I don't underestimate how difficult this is but nobody can wave a magic wand and make it all go away,"" she says. Scotland's first minister says there has been a ""sharp rise"" in cases with new cases more than doubling over the past week. Nicola Sturgeon says it is one of the sharpest rises the country has experienced at any point during the pandemic. ""Today's figure is the largest recorded in a single day though it is worth remembering that we do more testing now than was the case in the early stages of the pandemic,"" she says. She says that if the surge continues and accelerates and there is an increase in serious illness, she cannot rule out having to re-impose some restrictions. However, the first minister says she hopes not to have to do that and, if she does, the restrictions will be as limited and proportionate as possible. The country is at another ""fragile and pivotal moment"" in the pandemic, she adds. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is holding her coronavirus update. She begins by going through Tuesday's coronavirus figures. The first minister says there were 4,323 cases reported on Monday - the equivalent of 14.5% of all tests carried out. She says 364 people are in hospital - a rise of eight since yesterday and 43 people are in intensive care, two more than on Monday. A further 10 deaths have been recorded - that takes the total number of deaths registered under this daily measurement to 8,080. As of this morning 4,085,552 people have received one dose while 3,587,145 have received both doses. Around 80% of over-18s have now had both doses - and 95% of over-40s. She says these are ""genuinely remarkable"" figures. A statement on behalf of members of the Scottish branch of the UK group Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice welcomed the Scottish government's plans for a Covid inquiry. It says: ""The families are grateful that the Scottish government has listened to their demands and an independent Scottish public inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the deaths and the subsequent handling of the Covid pandemic will now take place."" It adds: ""Today is the first important step in establishing accountability for 10,421 lives lost to Covid-19 in Scotland."" It says that the core priority is to get the public inquiry up and running by the end of this calendar year. Scots are being asked for their views on an independent inquiry into the handling of the coronavirus pandemic. The Scottish government says it will be established by the end of the year to look at decisions and learn lessons for future pandemics. Particular consideration will be given to cases and deaths in care homes, the impact on education and the economy. The public are being encouraged to share their ideas and comments on email by 30 September. Deputy First Minister John Swinney said discussions were also ongoing with the UK government on the planned four nations inquiry. Read more detailshere. Long Covid patients in north Wales are helping the area's health board tailor a wide range of treatments to support fellow sufferers. Long Covid is defined as symptoms continuing for more than 12 weeks after an initial infection. About 15% of Covid patients are thought to be affected and, while not all will need ongoing treatment, many will. The Long Recovery Programme Group will feature regular meetings between staff and patients at Betsi Cadwaladr Health Board to hear first-hand accounts of health problems. One 38-year-old health worker now needs crutches to walk nearly 18 months after she first contracted Covid. Read morehere. The population of the Pacific territory of French Polynesia is largely unvaccinated Covid infections are soaring in the sparsely-populated Pacific territory of French Polynesia, with health authorities reporting 54 deaths from the virus over the weekend as the Delta variant spreads among a largely unvaccinated population. More than 300 people have died from Covid-19 since the pandemic hit the remote archipelago, home to 280,000 inhabitants. More than half of those deaths have come in the last three weeks. The territory has so far recorded 7,591 infections, although the true figure is likely to be higher as most asymptomatic people are not being tested. High rates of diabetes and obesity have made the population more vulnerable. The territory's limited health care system has struggled to cope, with one major hospital setting up beds in hallways to handle the rising number of patients. Bodies have been loaded onto refrigerator trucks to relieve pressure on the overwhelmed morgue. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Most of Channel 4's presenting line-up at the Tokyo Paralympics are disabled Channel 4 has said it would not be able to do ""anything like"" as much coverage of the Paralympics in the future if the broadcaster was privatised. The government is set to decide in the coming months whether the channel should have a private owner. Channel 4 will air 300 hours from Tokyo on TV, starting with Tuesday's opening ceremony, and 1,000 more hours online. Programming director Ian Katz said the budget would be cut for future games if profit was the channel's priority. ""I just don't think there's any chance that a primarily profit-driven Channel 4 would invest anything like what we invest in trying to build up and celebrate the Paralympics in the way we do,"" he told the Edinburgh Television Festival on Tuesday. ""I think we should make no mistake that a purely profit-driven Channel 4 would be a very different beast to the Channel 4 that we know now, and much that is really special and treasured about Channel 4 I think would very likely be lost."" 'TV has utterly and totally failed disabled people' A 'different' Games but Paralympians hope to shine Most of C4's Paralympics hosts will be disabled The channel, founded in 1982, is currently funded by advertising but is publicly-owned. A government consultation on privatisation will close in September. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden has said it is the right time to ""consider releasing Channel 4 from the constraints of public ownership"" and that the media world ""has changed immeasurably"" since the early 80s. The government has said Channel 4 is ""particularly vulnerable"" to fluctuations in the advertising market, and selling it ""could allow it to access new capital, create strategic partnerships, and reach international markets only available through the private sector"", as well as diversifying its income streams. Channel 4 consultation over privatisation begins Channel 4 warns of privatisation risks Mr Katz said some safeguards could be written into the licence with regulator Ofcom, but that they would be bound to come under pressure.

"Most of Channel 4's presenting line-up at the Tokyo Paralympics are disabled Channel 4 has said it would not be able to do ""anything like"" as much coverage of the Paralympics in the future if the broadcaster was privatised. The government is set to decide in the coming months whether the channel should have a private owner. Channel 4 will air 300 hours from Tokyo on TV, starting with Tuesday's opening ceremony, and 1,000 more hours online. Programming director Ian Katz said the budget would be cut for future games if profit was the channel's priority. ""I just don't think there's any chance that a primarily profit-driven Channel 4 would invest anything like what we invest in trying to build up and celebrate the Paralympics in the way we do,"" he told the Edinburgh Television Festival on Tuesday. ""I think we should make no mistake that a purely profit-driven Channel 4 would be a very different beast to the Channel 4 that we know now, and much that is really special and treasured about Channel 4 I think would very likely be lost."" 'TV has utterly and totally failed disabled people' A 'different' Games but Paralympians hope to shine Most of C4's Paralympics hosts will be disabled The channel, founded in 1982, is currently funded by advertising but is publicly-owned. A government consultation on privatisation will close in September. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden has said it is the right time to ""consider releasing Channel 4 from the constraints of public ownership"" and that the media world ""has changed immeasurably"" since the early 80s. The government has said Channel 4 is ""particularly vulnerable"" to fluctuations in the advertising market, and selling it ""could allow it to access new capital, create strategic partnerships, and reach international markets only available through the private sector"", as well as diversifying its income streams. Channel 4 consultation over privatisation begins Channel 4 warns of privatisation risks Mr Katz said some safeguards could be written into the licence with regulator Ofcom, but that they would be bound to come under pressure.

"Shop worker Tracey Davies had said dealing with abuse every day was exhausting ""I've been spat at and was worried I might die of Covid."" Shop worker Tracey Davies said her depression flared back up after abuse from customers during the pandemic. Now the Welsh government and the shop worker's union is calling for greater protection for UK retail staff asnew laws come into force in Scotland. The Home Office said new guidelines meant courts should increase sentences for assaults against people providing a service to the public, like shop staff. Research from Usdaw, which represents 380,000 shop workers in the UK, suggests more than than 90% of their members had suffered abuse, more than two-thirds threatened, and one in seven assaulted. Shop worker abused 'every day for a year' Supermarkets shut off non-essential items in Wales Ms Davies, 51, from Neath, said while customers in her store had ""got a lot better"", abuse she received throughout the pandemic had triggered relapses in her depression. A union says its research suggested one in seven shop workers had been assaulted She said she received abuse from about five people every day. ""I was doing my regular job, a gentleman came in, I asked him for ID, he didn't have it so he proceeded to spit in my face in the middle of a pandemic."" She said she washed repeatedly as the incident made her feel ""violently ill"". The shop worker is calling on people to ""simply be kind"". ""That's all I'm asking. If everyone was kind, I wouldn't be in this mess."" Some shop staff have said they have been abused bycustomers while trying to enforce government face mask rules. Supermarket workers have also spoken out abouthaving to ""referee"" what could and could not be bought in shopsafter the Welsh government banned the sale of non-essential items like clothes, toys and electrical goods last year. One worker from mid Wales told an Usdaw survey they had been ""rammed with trolleys on purpose"" while one deaf worker in west Wales said customers had told them they should not be working. Some supermarket aisles were closed off during Wales' firebreak lockdown last year One supermarket giant revealed a 76% rise in reports of antisocial behaviour and verbal abuse towards its staff in 2020, withmore than 100 incidents at Co-op storesevery day. The Welsh government wants to follow the Scottish government's route and introduce tougher laws for perpetrators of abuse and violence towards shop staff but it is not a devolved power in Wales so is under the jurisdiction of Westminster. ""Any abuse directed at staff who are doing their job and helping to keep customers safe is completely unacceptable,"" said a Welsh government spokesperson. ""We support Usdaw's call for greater protections for shop workers, and with criminal justice currently reserved to the UK government, we urge them to bring forward the necessary legislation."" A law protecting shop workers would ""be amazing because we do mean something and we are important"", Jane Jones says Jane Jones, a checkout supervisor from Mold, said workers had ""always been abused"" but it had escalated since the pandemic began. The mother-of-two who has worked in retail for about 20 years said: ""You can be really anxious going to work. ""You're building yourself up to it before you go because you know what's coming."" Mrs Jones said that meant being sworn at, having items thrown at staff, and people moving closer to them when being asked to keep their distance. She said this had left colleagues reduced to tears and needing to take time off work due to stress and anxiety. Usdaw's general secretary called abuse against shop workers a ""disgrace"" Supermarket workers facing coronavirus 'abuse' Don't allow shop abuse to worsen, bosses tell PM ""It is heartbreaking to hear these testimonies from Welsh shop workers who deserve far more respect than they receive,"" said Paddy Lillis, Usdaw's general secretary. ""Our latest survey results clearly show the scale of the appalling violence, threats and abuse faced by shop workers and demonstrate the need for a 'protection of shop workers' law."" Linda Richards says the whole of the UK should have the same laws to protect shop workers As a union representative, Linda Richards said ""more and more people"" had come to her after suffering abusive treatment from some customers. She said the law introduced in Scotland should be the same ""across the board"". ""If you can't respect people, you should be held accountable for that."" The UK government said the Sentencing Council's revised assault guidelines were published in May and required courts to treat an offence committed against those working in the public sector or providing a service to the public as an aggravating factor, making the offence more serious. ""It is completely unacceptable to threaten or assault shop workers, not least when they are working so hard to keep vital services running,"" said a Home Office spokesperson. ""We are putting 20,000 extra police officers into our communities to cut crime - including retail crime - and we launched the Shop Kind campaign in April to provide better support to victims and encourage customers to treat shop workers with dignity and respect. ""The Sentencing Council has set out guidelines which means courts should increase sentences for assaults committed against all those providing a service to the public, which includes shop workers.""

"Millie Court and Liam Reardon Almost three million people tuned in live to watch Millie Court and Liam Reardon be crowned winners of this year's Love Island on Monday. The pair beat three other couples to the hit ITV2 show's Â£50,000 prize. The dating show's finale attracted an average live audience of 2.8 million. That's a 22% drop from the 3.6 million who tuned in to the climax ofthe last summer series in 2019, but an improvement on the figures forlast year's inaugural winter series. This year's series - the first since the programme made its winter debut just before Covid hit in early 2020 - has been broadcast from its Spanish villa for the past eight weeks. Millie, a fashion buyer's assistant from Essex, had considered splitting from Welsh bricklayer Liam after he was unfaithful during Casa Amor week, but the pair reunited to become exclusive. Speaking after the show, Millie and Liam thanked fans for their support and described their time on Love Island as the ""summer of our lives"". Allow Twitter content?

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. The couple agreed to share the prize money in the finale, which saw ITV2 outperform many of the main terrestrial channels in the 21:00-22:30 BST timeslot, including ITV, BBC Two, Channel 4 and Channel 5. The broadcaster said a further 400,000 viewers had watched the final episode on the ITV Hub by late morning on Tuesday. ITV boss Kevin Lygo said: ""We're delighted that the final ended on a ratings high, rounding off a series that is on track to be the most popular yet, in terms of viewing on ITV Hub, and averaging over four million per episode across all devices."" The other couples to make it to the final were Chloe Burrows and Toby Aromolaran; Faye Winter and Teddy Soares; and Kaz Kamwi and Tyler Cruickshank. Love Island - are we over the honeymoon phase? Liam Reardon's hometown celebrates Love Island win Love Island row sparks record 25,000 complaints They will be offered ""comprehensive psychological support"" and a ""proactive aftercare package"" on their return from Majorca as part of ITV's revised duty-of-care protocols. However, some of Love Island's staple dramatic twists have proved highly controversial this year. The sight of Faye aggressively confronting Teddy after being shown footage of him from flirting during Casa Amor weekprompted record audience complaints to broadcast regulator Ofcom. That followed thousands of complaints that July's Casa Amor postcard episode wasmanipulative toward the female islanders. TV commentator Scott Bryan said the rise in complaints, while in part down to social media communities knowing ""who to complain to"", suggested audiences were now expecting kinder reality television. ""It's that balance between having that form of entertainment whilst also trying to cause a bit of controversy and create storylines,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live on Tuesday. Viewers are also beginning to question the authenticity of contestants. Craig Phillips, winner of the first season of Big Brother in 2000, told 5 Live that the cast went into the villa with ""an agenda and commercial direction they want to go in"" and that producers had far more input than during his time as a contestant. The eight finalists before this year's final Bryan said the cooling of Love Island fever suggested the start of a ""downward trend of 'constructed reality', which is what Love Island is"". In her review,The Guardian's Lauren O'Neill said,externalthe show was ""tired"" and this series had ""ended with the whimper of predictability in its ears"". Despite that, the show has remained a significant commercial asset for ITV with itspredominantly young and female audience particularly valuable to advertisers. Kevin Lygo said it had been the most popular programme with 16- to 34-year-olds for 44 nights during its latest run. By Alex Taylor, entertainment reporter Faye's outburst - The fallout from the Casa Amor week is always dramatic, but this year proved especially volatile. Faye's aggressive reaction to a clip, shown without full context to imply her partner Teddy had cheated on her, sparked record complaints. Some viewers alleged manipulation from producers, arguing that Faye's self-professed trust issues had been exploited for dramatic effect. Hugo's loveless summer - Ahead of the series, PE teacher Hugoprompted debate as Love Island's first physically disabled contestant, but once inside the villa it was his admission that he did not like ""fake"" women that turned heads. The comments offended a number of islanders, eventually causing Hugo to tearfully apologise. His search for love didn't improve, with social media recoiling in horror when he shouted ""job done"" seconds after kissing Amy. All is forgiven? - All the men except Jake and Teddy cheated on their partners during their week-long stay in the Casa Amor villa.  You wouldn't have known it approaching the final, however, as Millie forgave Liam, just as Kaz (eventually) gave Tyler another chance. Who says romance is dead? Heartbreak for Jiberty - Jake and Liberty appeared to be one of the season's strongest couples, but their spark eventually fizzled out when Liberty began to get ""the ick"" and doubt Jake's authenticity towards her. The pair split in dramatic fashion before amicably agreeing to leave the villa together on Friday after their final date - much to the disbelief of their fellow islanders. Laura Whitmore's ""multitasking"" struggle - Love Island's host opened up about the challenge of fronting the show as a new mother in a pandemic. The presenter, who has been criticised by some for her infrequent appearances,opened up to fans on Instagram,externalon Monday. ""To get this far hasn't been easy,"" she wrote. ""The last few months have been full on. Getting through fronting the biggest show on the telly means you are faced with daily pressures on and off tv, filming and flying during Covid, media intrusion, being a mother, breastfeeding exclusively, pcr tests, allowing your body to heal, getting that pelvic floor back (she ain't back quite yet!), constant judgement, looking after your mental healthâ¦ Just surviving each day on a manic schedule is tough.""

"Kamala Harris in her visit to Asia has sought to reassure allies Like many across the world, millions in Asia have been shocked by the scenes of desperation coming out of Afghanistan - with some asking if America can still be trusted. On Sunday evening - just a week after the Afghan capital Kabul fell to the Taliban - US vice-president Kamala Harris landed in Singapore for the start of a whirlwind Asian tour. She has since sought to smooth ruffled feathers by saying the region is a ""top priority"" for the US. But is it enough to reassure those concerned in Asia? And can America fend off China's attempts to seize on what some say is a golden opportunity for anti-US propaganda? On Monday, Singapore's prime minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that many in the region were watching how the US repositions itself in the fallout of Afghanistan. Kamala Harris on charm offensive in South East Asia Kamala Harris condemns China, deflects from Kabul For two of America's biggest regional allies in particular, South Korea and Japan, public confidence in the US has largely been unaffected - but there have been anxious murmurings from some quarters. Some conservatives havecalled for their militaries to be beefed up,external, arguing that they cannot fully trust in America's promise to back them up in a conflict. The US presently has tens of thousands of troops stationed in both countries, but former president Donald Trump's America First foreign policy had strained relationships. In an interview with ABC News last week, US President Joe Biden insisted there was a ""fundamental difference"" between Afghanistan and allies like South Korea, Japan and Taiwan, saying it was ""not even comparable"". The Taliban takeover of Afghanistan has unsettled many in Asia Experts have agreed, pointing out that Afghanistan is not the same as more developed places in Asia which have their own substantial military resources and strong governments. As Asian democracies, they share similar values as America and have become significant trade and military partners. And with places like South Korea formingthe bedrock of US military strategy,externalin Asia, it would be unlikely that the US would pull out its troops any time soon. But as uncertainty swirls, China has ratcheted up its rhetoric. China's foreign Minister Wang Yi said last week that the US ""hasty"" pullout from Afghanistan has caused a ""serious negative impact ""while some hawkish government figures and state media have gone one step further. Foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian has repeatedlycompared it to the fall of Saigon,external, while his colleague Hua Chunying called the US ""destructive"", adding that ""wherever the US sets footâ¦ we see turbulence, division, broken families, deaths and other scars in the mess it has left."" Nationalist tabloid Global Timescarried an editorial,externalurging Taiwan to stop ""bonding themselves to the anti-Chinese mainland chariot of the US"", arguing that the US would not bother waging a costly war with China over Taiwan. Its editor-in-chief also posted this tweet: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Taiwan, which buys weapons from the US, considers itself as an independent country, but China sees it as a renegade province that must be reclaimed even by force. The island has fought back in recent days by repeatedly likening China to the Taliban. Premier Su Tseng-chang said last week that ""foreign forces"" who wanted to invade Taiwan were ""deluded"", while foreign minister Joseph Wu had this to say: Allow Twitter content?

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. The situation was not helped by Mr Biden who, in his ABC interview, appeared to conflate Taiwan with South Korea and Japan, with whom the US has formal agreements to defend if war breaks out. Unlike the others, Taiwan does not have a defence treaty with the US and only an implicit security guarantee. US officials later said their ""strategic ambiguity"" policy on Taiwan had not changed, but the incident only gave Chinese state media more fodder to attack the US. The Afghanistan exit, in other words, has been a golden opportunity for China to convince the Asian public that the US cannot be trusted, say experts. ""The whole point of this propaganda is to increase public pressure on governments that have close cooperation with US, and weaken that relationship,"" said Ian Chong, an associate professor of political science with the National University of Singapore. But Afghanistan has not been a total windfall for China either. Bonnie Glaser, an Asia expert at the German Marshall Fund, believes that Beijing sees the recent changes in Afghanistan as more risky than beneficial.  ""The Chinese are very worried about the potential for instability and Afghanistan continuing to be a haven for militants and terrorists,"" she said. In a pragmatic move, China invited the Taliban over for talks last month, offering economic support for Afghanistan but also stressing that the country should not be used as a staging point for terrorists. China has skin in the game: its companies have wonmulti-million dollar oil and copper mining contracts,externalin Afghanistan. China's foreign minister Wang Yi (right) posed for pictures with the Taliban leader Mullah Baradar (left) But domestically, it has struggled to sell this cautious alliance to some parts of the Chinese public that are repulsed by the Taliban. When the Taliban retook power last week, foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said that China respects ""the choice of Afghan people"". The phrase quickly attracted backlash and accusations of whitewashing on Chinese social media. At a time of heightened awareness of women's rights in China, many online have criticised the Taliban for their treatment of Afghan women. There's also the fact that Beijing now has to deal with an Islamist militant group right at its doorstep, at a time when China continues to brutally crack down on its own Muslim minority in the name of combating extremism. With the clampdown on the Uighurs, ""the Chinese central government has been getting people to be wary of religious groups. So this association with the Taliban could be problematic as it's contradictory,"" said Dr Chong. ""What China is doing now is to garner whatever tactical advantage they can get. But what [kind of gains] it can be transformed into, is up in the air. We don't even know where Afghanistan is going right now."" Some observers, like Ms Glaser, believe that the Afghan withdrawal is not ""the death knell of US leadership"", and that US allies will be reassured that Washington would now pay greater attention to the region and its competition with China. In her speech on Tuesday in Singapore, Ms Harris sold a vision of American faithfulness to Asia. She said ""there should be no doubt we have enduring interests in this region and enduring commitments as wellâ¦ those commitments also include security"", and promised that the US would ""invest our time and our energy"" in strengthening relationships. Ms Harris in Singapore on Tuesday received an orchid that was named after her James Crabtree, executive director of think tank II-SS Asia, noted that Ms Harris' visit was one of several made to Asia in recent months by top US officials. ""The Americans have answered the first set of criticisms which is 'You've forgotten us' - now they are turning up,"" he said. ""Now the next question is, with all this talk of partnerships, what does this amount to in fact?"" Some believe the US will need to deliver more than just promises. Dr Chong said this may mean getting bipartisan support for US commitments, ratifying the UN's maritime law convention, and re-joining the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement which the US withdrew from under Donald Trump. Said Mr Crabtree: ""People are going to watch more closely what the US is going to do in Asia from now on, because Afghanistan has primed them to look for signs that they are not reliable. The US may be more wary of people questioning their commitment and would want to demonstrate it is not the case."" This video can not be played US-China relations: Biden and Xi - friends or foes?

"Covid-19 has been mentioned on the death certificate of nearly 10,500 people in Scotland Scotland is to hold its own public inquiry into the handling of the Covid pandemic by the end of the year, the Scottish government has confirmed. The announcement follows pressure from relatives of some who have died. The inquiry will scrutinise decisions that were taken over the course of the crisis, with the aim of learning lessons for any future pandemics. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon had previously said her preference was for a UK-wide inquiry to be held. But Prime Minister Boris Johnson told MPs in May that an independent public inquiry examining the handling of the pandemic across all four UK nationswould not begin until the spring of next year, despite Ms Sturgeon calling for it to start this year. Warning over Covid restrictions as cases hit new high Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? Campaigners from the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group said a separate Scottish inquiry was needed to examine decisions made by the devolved Scottish government, and to hold it to account. Deputy First Minister John Swinney met representatives of the group shortly before the announcement was made. Almost 10,500 deaths have been registered in Scotland where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate since the pandemic began. The Scottish government is inviting people to give their views on the aims and principles of the public inquiry by 30 September. It said particular consideration would be given to the ""four harms"" of the pandemic: Direct health impacts of Covid-19, including cases and deaths in care homes Other non-Covid health impacts Societal impacts, including education Economic impacts It will also investigate ""events causing public concern"", for example thehigh number of deaths in care homes, and will examine the explanations of the decisions that were taken and the causes of ""anything which may not have gone as expected"". First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and former Health Secretary Jeane Freeman have both admitted that the way elderly people were discharged from hospitals into care homes at the start of the pandemic was a mistake. More than 1,300 elderly people were sent to care homes before a robust testing regime was in place. Ms Sturgeon told her Covid briefing on Tuesday: ""The inquiry will look at all matters related to the handling of the pandemic that are within our devolved competence. ""This will include of course the situation in our care homes."" Donald Macaskill, the chief executive of Scottish Care, the representative body for Scotland's independent care homes, told BBC Scotland the desire to protect the NHS did not appear to have included social care, which was treated as a second class citizen. He criticised the lack of planning and support with protective equipment (PPE) and said the inquiry needed to look at whether it was ""realistic"" to expect residential care homes to follow infection control procedures which were as stringent as an acute hospital setting. Asked if care homes would make financial pay-outs to the families of people who went into care homes Covid-free and died from the virus, Mr Macaskill said: ""I have no doubt that if there is culpability on the part of a care home provider then appropriate action will be taken - but if that culpability rests with government, with the NHS, with other parts of the system then I think that is a more fundamental question the inquiry will explore."" Ms Sturgeon has admitted that the way elderly people were discharged from hospital to care homes in the early stages of the pandemic was a mistake In her briefing, Ms Sturgeon stressed that the Scottish government would ""liaise closely"" with the UK government and the other devolved administrations on the likely terms of a UK wide inquiry to ""avoid duplication and overlap"". She added: ""The need for co-operation with other governments is not in my view a reason to delay the establishment of our own inquiry. ""I do believe a full public inquiry has an extremely important role to play, both in scrutinising the decisions that we took and indeed continue to take in the course of the pandemic, but also of course in identifying and learning appropriate lessons for the future."" The government said the announcement met its commitment to begin to take the necessary steps to establish a public inquiry within its first 100 days in office after the Holyrood election. Discussions are also under way to identify and appoint a judge to chair the inquiry. Solicitor Aamer Anwar, who is acting on behalf of members of Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice, welcomed the announcement but said the public inquiry must be truly independent and leave no stone unturned. And he said grieving families must be at the heart of the inquiry process if it is to be effective and meaningful. Mr Anwar also urged the prime minister to follow the Scottish government's lead and bring forward a UK-wide inquiry. Members of the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group welcomed the announcement at an event in Glasgow Peter McMahon, who lost his wife Debbie to coronavirus at the age of 53 from coronavirus, was one of the campaigners who watched the first minister announce the inquiry, which he said was ""very welcome"". He added: ""My wife Debbie, along with thousands of others, died what I see as an avoidable death. ""I would like this public inquiry to confirm who took certain decisions, clarify why they were taken, especially around the ending of shielding in July 2020."" Scottish Conservative health spokeswoman Annie Wells said the inquiry must uncover what went wrong throughout the pandemic, especially in care homes. She added: ""It's a disgrace that they are only getting around to this now, when Nicola Sturgeon promised it would be a priority during the election campaign. ""Major errors were made by the SNP government that left our most vulnerable citizens unprotected."" Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said the Scottish government had been ""dragging their feet, ignoring the pain of the grieving families and sacrifices of thousands of key workers"". He said: ""The first minister must end the dither and delay and act now so that light can be shone on the Scottish government's handling of the pandemic, lessons can be learned, and justice can be done."" Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Alex Cole-Hamilton said: ""Last summer, the Scottish government mismanaged quarantine and the return of students to campus allowing the virus to be re-seeded. Test and Protect was unprepared for the pressure of restrictions easing and tracing collapsed. People were discharged in their thousands from hospitals to care homes without tests or even after testing positive. ""This needs to be an avenue to accountability and responsibility for what happened in Scotland."" Scottish Greens co-leader Lorna Slater said: ""It's vital that the government's handling of the pandemic is subject to the most thorough scrutiny, and that's why this inquiry is so necessary. ""It's essential that we establish how the country could have been better prepared, and learn every lesson possible, to ensure we are in a better position to handle future public health crises."" It comes as the number of daily cases of the virus in Scotlandreached a new record high of 4,323on Tuesday, with Ms Sturgeon saying that she cannot rule out having to reintroduce ""limited and proportionate"" restrictions. The number of new cases has more than doubled over the past week, with Ms Sturgeon warning that the country was at another ""fragile and pivotal moment"" in the pandemic. A total of 364 people were in hospital on Monday with recently confirmed Covid-19, up by eight on the previous day, with 43 patients in intensive care, up two.

"McDonald's has run out of milkshakes and some bottled drinks at restaurants in England, Scotland and Wales. The fast-food chain said it was facing supply chain issues affecting the availability of shakes and bottled drinks at its 1,250 outlets. An updated statement said it was ""working hard"" to limit the impact on deliveries and customers and had taken some items off its menus for now. It confirmed the lorry driver shortage was one reason behind the disruption. Its statement said: ""As reported, a number of issues are impacting retailers in the UK at the moment, one of which is the nationwide shortage of HGV drivers."" A wide range of businesses have reported problems with supplies because of the driver shortage. Last week, Nando's closed some outlets after running out of chicken. Earlier this month, a survey bythe Road Haulage Association (RHA) estimated there was a shortageof more than 100,000 drivers in the UK, out of a pre-pandemic total of about 600,000. The RHA has said some 30,000 HGV driving tests did not take place last year because of the coronavirus pandemic, adding that a ""historic"" shortage in drivers had been exacerbated by changes to rules following Brexit. More recently, drivers being told to self-isolate after being notified by the NHS Covid app have also added to the problem. Act now to end lorry driver crisis, government told How serious is the HGV driver shortage? Analysis of the latest ONS Labour Force Survey for the second quarter suggests that 14,000 EU lorry drivers left jobs in the UK in the year toâ¯June 2020, but only 600 had returned by July 2021. Firms from a number of sectors in the UK have been battling with a supply chain crisis due to a shortage of lorry drivers.On Friday, Logistics UK, which represents freight firms, and the British Retail Consortium (BRC) wrote to the government to plead for new measures to alleviate the problem. Tesco has been offering lorry drivers a Â£1,000 joining bonus amid a chronic shortage of drivers in the industry. Other companies are also understood to be offering similar incentives for HGV drivers after disruption to supply chains led to product shortages. Morrisons said it was working on schemes to train staff to become lorry drivers. A government spokesperson said last week it was bringing in a package of measures to help tackle the HGV driver shortage, including plans to streamline the process for new drivers to gain their HGV licence and to increase the number of tests that can be conducted. Although famous for its Big Macs and fries, McDonald's is actually one of the biggest drinks retailers in the UK. The shift towards McCafÃ©s and promotion of coffee sales was a deliberate policy in the last decade to try to bring in more customers outside of normal mealtimes. But faced with supply chain issues, it has decided to prioritise its big sellers at the expense of milkshakes. Because every element of the burger needs to be present in the production line, those deliveries are being secured. Bottled drinks can sit in a warehouse much longer without going out of date. The timing of this shortage coming in the summer holiday season has meant a higher number of customers will be disappointed at missing out on their milkshakes. It has also temporarily relaxed drivers' hours rules to allow HGV drivers to make slightly longer journeys. Other leading businesses have reported problems caused by driver shortages. Last week, Nando's was forced to close about 50 of its restaurants after running out of chicken. Rival KFC also warned recently that supply chain issues meant it was unable to stock some menu items. Dairy giant Arla has had to cut back on milk deliveries to supermarkets because of a shortage of drivers, while sweet producer Haribo also reported problems resulting from a shortage of drivers. Oil giant BP temporarily closed a ""handful"" of its UK sites because not enough unleaded petrol and diesel had been delivered. McDonald's apologised for any inconvenience and thanked customers for their patience. Act now to end lorry driver crisis, government told Nando's hopes to reopen fully from Saturday Why is there an HGV driver shortage?

"School pupils still need to wear masks in class Nicola Sturgeon has said she cannot rule out the reintroduction of some Covid restrictions as the number of daily cases reached a  record high. The first minister said the country was at another ""fragile and pivotal moment"" in the pandemic. She said she hopes not to have to reintroduce restrictions, and that if this happened they would be as limited and proportionate as possible. A total of 4,323 new cases were reported on Tuesday. The previous highest level was during the summer wave in early July, when the number of daily cases peaked at 4,234. Live coverage of the first minister's briefing Scottish Covid inquiry to start later this year What are Scotland's Covid rules? The Scottish government has also announced that apublic inquiry into the handling of the Covid pandemicwill begin by the end of the year. Ms Sturgeon told a Covid briefing that there had been a ""sharp rise"" in Covid-19 cases in recent days. ""New cases in Scotland have more than doubled over the past week, and that is one of the sharpest rises we have experienced at any point during the pandemic,"" she said. She said the latest daily figure was the largest recorded in a single day - although more testing was now being carried out than in earlier stages of the pandemic. The first minister said: ""We always knew cases were likely to rise as restrictions eased, so to some extent what we are seeing now is not entirely unexpected. ""That said, the scale of the increase is still a cause of real concern."" Ms Sturgeon said it was a ""fragile and pivotal"" moment, adding: ""If this surge continues and accelerates and we start to see evidence of substantial increase in serious illness, we cannot completely rule out having to reimpose some restrictions. We hope not to do that."" Ms Sturgeon said people could take steps such as getting vaccinated, sticking to the rules on face coverings, and being mindful of physical distancing, unnecessary contacts and ventilation. The first minister said vaccination was ""making a big difference"" and that many of the new cases were in younger people, who were ""less likely"" to have had both doses of vaccine. 'No single reason' for Dumfries and Galloway surge Where are the latest cases in Scotland? She said that about half of all new cases were in people under the age of 25 with 34% of Tuesday's tally in the under 19s. An additional 10 deaths linked to Covid were reported, taking the total under the daily measure to 8,080. The test positivity rate was 14.5%, up from 12.4% the previous day. Covid restrictions were eased earlier this year A total of 4,085,552 people have received the first dose of a Covid-19 vaccination, and 3,587,145 have had their second. Most of the Covid restrictions in Scotland were lifted when the country moved beyond the level zero rules on 9 August. Physical distancing rules and the limits on gatherings were removed, and all venues were allowed to reopen. There were also changes to rules on self-isolation - but face coverings still need to be worn in many public spaces, including schools. Is the first minister preparing us for the return of restrictions? Well, not necessarily. Her now trademark cautious tone was there. She described the state of the pandemic as ""fragile"" and spoke about ""real concern"" over rising cases. But Nicola Sturgeon was also keen to stress the impact of the vaccination programme on the number of people becoming seriously ill with the virus. That will be a key barometer for ministers when it comes to the next steps. Further increases in cases could lead to greater pressure on the NHS - and the government may then have to act. The door hasn't been closed on the reintroduction of Covid measures. But today's briefing could be described as a warning shot about what might come further down the tracks, rather than laying the groundwork of an inevitable move backwards. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said: ""Nicola Sturgeon's lingering threat to impose more constraints on people's lives is unjustifiable, given the success of Scotland and the UK's vaccine scheme. ""The public want to move on but Nicola Sturgeon is unable or unwilling to give up the control she has had. Just a few weeks after most Covid rules have been dropped, she's talking of bringing them back. She seems determined to prolong restrictions, no matter the cost to jobs, our NHS or people's mental health."" He added: ""This is a different phase of the pandemic, when NHS remobilisation and rebuilding Scotland's economy should be our top priorities."" Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Alex Cole-Hamilton said the rising case numbers were ""troubling"". He said: ""I think it is very telling that was not met with the introduction of further restrictions. ""It suggests we have moved to a different phase in Covid where we have accepted we have to live around it, and it will be a fact of life for the foreseeable future.""

"Online accommodation platform Airbnb has said it will temporarily house 20,000 Afghan refugees at no charge to help them resettle across the world. The company's boss said the move was in response to ""one of the biggest humanitarian crises of our time"". He said the firm felt a responsibility to step up. Chief executive Brian Chesky added: ""I hope this inspires other business leaders to do the same. There's no time to waste."" ""As tens of thousands of Afghan refugees resettle around the world, where they stay will be the first chapter in their new lives. For these 20,000 refugees, my hope is that the Airbnb community will provide them with not only a safe place to rest and start over, but also a warm welcome home,"" he said. The offer starts immediately and the company said it was working with non-governmental organisations ""on the ground"" to help with the most pressing needs. It has not specified how much the company plans to spend on the initiative or how long refugees will be housed for. But it said it would collaborate with resettlement agencies and partners ""to go where the need goes"" and evolve the initiative and its support as necessary. Where will all the Afghan refugees go? With just a suitcase, Afghans leave their homeland ""Starting today, Airbnb will begin housing 20,000 Afghan refugees globally for free,"" Mr Chesky tweeted on Tuesday. ""While we will be paying for these stays, we could not do this without the generosity of our hosts."" The company said the cost of the stays would be funded through contributions from Airbnb and Mr Chesky, as well as donors to the Airbnb.org Refugee Fund. He said: ""The displacement and resettlement of Afghan refugees in the US and elsewhere is one of the biggest humanitarian crises of our time."" Airbnb said it would release more details soon about how people might help. The company said: ""We know that Airbnb hosts and guests around the world will be eager to stand up and assist this massive effort - and in the coming days, Airbnb and Airbnb.org plan to share details on how hosts and the broader community can support this initiative."" Property owners who host Airbnb locations have long been encouraged to donate stays at their homes for ""people in crisis"". The scheme began in response to Hurricane Sandy in 2012, when more than 1,000 people needed emergency accommodation after New York city was hit. Since then, it claims to have helped more than 75,000 people. The company launched its Open Homes initiative in 2017 to allow its host community to offer their homes for free to people hit by disasters or fleeing conflict. The initiative has since offered free stays to people affected by the Mexico City earthquake, Californian wildfires, Australian bushfires and other disasters. It also led to the company setting up its own independent non-profit, Airbnb.org, to focus on helping people share housing and resources with each other in times of crisis. Last week, it gave emergency funding and support to the International Rescue Committee, HIAS and Church World Service to provide temporary stays for up to 1,000 arriving Afghan refugees. During the last weekend, it placed 165 refugees in safe housing shortly after touching down in the US. ""Accessible housing is urgently needed and essential,"" said David Miliband, president of the International Rescue Committee. Have you been affected by the issues raised in this story?

"Bobbie, left, fears the charges will mean her daughter Saskia missing out on activities she enjoys Disabled and vulnerable adults in England are being hit by a steep rise in the amount they have to pay towards their care, BBC News research reveals. Some adults with learning disabilities are paying thousands of pounds extra a year, with six councils doubling the amount of money collected in charges. In half of 83 areas that responded to a BBC request, bills across all users have risen at least 10% over two years. Directors of council care services blame years of government funding cuts. Saskia Granville was shocked when, earlier this year, her care charges increased more than 400% - from Â£92 to Â£515 a month. She has a learning disability and lives in supported accommodation in Worthing, West Sussex, but fears the charges will curtail her independence. ""When Mum told me, she just burst out into tears,"" Saskia says. ""It makes me really upset."" Saskia loves to play football but fears she will no longer be able to afford the train fare A sum of almost Â£1,500 was also taken out of Saskia's bank account as a backdated payment, in March, leaving her in debt. Her mother, Bobbie, says: ""Without my intervention, she wouldn't have had any food that week. ""She wouldn't have been able to pay her gas, electricity or water bills."" Bobbie is challenging the charge increase but says there has been no notable progress. What are the challenges facing social care? Laura Kuenssberg: What are the sticking points? The rise has also left Saskia worrying whether she can continue playing football each week - and coaching a girls' team - because of the train fare and team subscription. ""It's very important because it's my favourite sport,"" she says. ""I love going."" West Sussex County Council said its charging arrangements, based on ""a person's ability to contribute towards the financial costs of [their] care"", ""follow national guidance"".  13%average increase in how much disabled and frail people asked  to contribute, in two years 83councils responded to BBC request for information (151 were asked) Equivalent Â£500rise per person with learning disabilities, in 22 of those councils BBC News sent 151 councils a Freedom of Information request asking how much those living in the community had to pay towards their care. In the 83 that responded, the amount disabled and frail people are expected to contribute has risen from Â£369m in 2018-19 to Â£420m in 2020-21. And the rise is particularly apparent for those with learning disabilities, who often need greater levels of support. In 22 councils, the charges have risen by the equivalent of Â£500 per person supported, since 2018-19. But in other areas, the charges have fallen since the start of the pandemic, during which time many people have had their levels of support cut. And in one council, Hammersmith and Fulham, residents are charged nothing for their care. Matthew has a severe learning disability and sometimes will communicate only with his mother via his phone Matthew Willis has a severe learning disability and Smith-Magenis syndrome, which has autism-like features. His mother, Lulu, says this can lead to behavioural challenges, as he becomes frustrated at struggling to communicate, such as ""meltdowns"" that can last for days and include him self-harming and breaking down doors. Respite services, where support workers take care of Matthew, have provided an important change of scenery and helped her own mental wellbeing. But this is no longer something the family can afford - as Matthew's care charges have now risen from about Â£20 to more than Â£300 a month. ""It is totally immoral,"" Lulu says. ""I want my son to have a meaningful life - and the money from his benefits goes towards paying for that."" Jackie O'Sullivan, from the charity Mencap that represents people with learning disabilities, said the charge rises meant ""the least well off in society [having] to make up for the shortfall [in funding]... that should come from the government"". Many were still receiving less support than before the pandemic but ""having to make tough choices between food and heating, and paying for care"". And only 6% of those with learning disabilities were in work, making finding the extra money ""impossible"" for many. Anyone who receives care from their council will have a very high need for support and a low income. So it is a sign of the acute financial pressures faced by local authorities in England that there has been such a significant increase in the money raised from people needing services. Most who receive council support rely on benefits, so finding extra money to contribute to care, which is vital to their quality of life, can cause real hardship. The pandemic has increased the demand for support and the financial pressures on a care system already in crisis. For many, it is perhaps one of the most shameful signs of that crisis that it is people in the toughest of circumstances having to dig deeper to plug the financial gaps. The prime minister has promised he will reveal his long-awaited plans for reform by the end of the year. But Saskia, Mathew and many others need investment in a care system that will help them lead the best lives they can, right now. Cath Roff, of the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services, said councils were ""really stretched"" after ""10 years of austerity"". Calling on the government to ""bring forward [social care] reform now"", she said raising care charges was ""not what any local authority would want to do - but... we need to stay solvent"". ""We now have Covid, which has added extra pressures,"" she said. ""We've got people coming forward with increased needs - [and] we have a workforce crisis."" The Department of Health and Social Care said it would bring forward proposals to reform the adult social-care system ""later this year"". And since the start of the pandemic, it had ""committed over Â£6bn to councils, through un-ringfenced grants to tackle the impact of Covid-19 on their services, including adult social care"". Social care, the system for helpingboth disabled and older people, is in a bad way. Demand is up, financial support is down. For years, governments have promised a solution. Now, Boris Johnson has said he will set out plans for reform by the end of the year. BBC News will be looking at the issue from all sides, over the coming weeks.

"Afghan refugees have been arriving in the US The US is being pressed by allies to delay its withdrawal from Afghanistan to allow more time for evacuating those who want to flee the country, now that it is run by Taliban militants. US troops controlling Kabul airport - the only one in the country functioning - are scheduled to leave by 31 August. The UK is hosting a G-7 summit, warning ""not everyone will get out"". The Taliban have warned of consequences if foreign forces remain after the deadline agreed with the US. Currently 5,800 US troops are on the ground. President Joe Biden is set to decide within the next 24 hours whether to extend their stay, an official told Reuters news agency. The US has evacuated, and facilitated the evacuation of, approximately 48,000 people since an intense airlift started on 14 August, the White House said. Others seeking to flee remain crammed in or near the international airport in the capital, Kabul. Many of the people fleeing, particularly those who worked with foreign forces, live in fear of reprisals from a group that imposed a harsh version of Islamic law when in power from 1996 to 2001. By Yogita Limaye, BBC South Asia correspondent Thousands of people, foreign nationals and Afghans, continue to throng the gates of Kabul airport. Amidst the crowds, even those with the right permits aren't able to get through. Some have been waiting there for days, with little shelter or food. At least 20 have been killed in shootings and stampedes at the airport since last week. More than 10,000 were evacuated on Monday, but time is running out. Elsewhere in Afghanistan, the BBC has spoken to people who have been in hiding out of fear they will be killed by the Taliban. They say they don't have the means to leave. There are millions who support the insurgent group as well, hoping they will bring an end to the violence. The Taliban have been holding discussions on forming a government. Markets and workplaces are slowly opening up. But banks are still closed and fewer women are visible on the streets. Johnson to urge world leaders to step up Afghan support Why can't the UK hold Kabul airport without the US? France, Germany and the UK have pressed for more time to complete the evacuations from Afghanistan. France's Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told reporters in the United Arab Emirates: ""We are concerned about the deadline set by the United States on August 31. Additional time is needed to complete ongoing operations."" Germany's Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said he had discussed keeping Kabul airport open beyond the deadline with Nato allies and the Taliban. On Tuesday, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to push the US for an extension during the virtual summit with other G7 leaders. But Defence Secretary Ben Wallace it would all depend on both the US and the Taliban. ""Our focus is to get as many people out,"" Mr Wallace said. ""But the scale of the challenge means that not everyone will get out. We are ruthlessly prioritising people."" This video can not be played Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen told the BBC that foreign troops staying past 31 August would be ""a clear violation"" Military advisers have told the White House that a decision must be made on Tuesday in order to allow for the troops, along with their equipment and weapons, to leave in time for the deadline, CNN reports.

Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen told the BBC people with passports  would still be able to leave on commercial flights after the deadline. He said: ""We want them to stay in the country but if they intend to go, they can."" The United Nations human rights council is set to meet in an emergency session on Tuesday to discuss Afghanistan. It comes amid warnings from aid agencies about the deepening humanitarian crisis in the country and concerns over human rights, in particular, the rights of women. The Taliban say they will respect the rights of women and girls but there are already reports of detentions and executions. Human rights groups say the UN must create an international, independent body to investigate what is happening. Tuesday's emergency human rights council session could do this - but the draft resolution, submitted by Pakistan does not go that far, says the BBC's Imogen Foulkes, in Geneva. The resolution asks the UN human rights chief to keep an eye on things, and report back in December.

"McDonald's has run out of milkshakes and some bottled drinks at restaurants in England, Scotland and Wales. The fast-food chain said it was facing supply chain issues affecting the availability of shakes and bottled drinks at its 1,250 outlets. An updated statement said it was ""working hard"" to limit the impact on deliveries and customers and had taken some items off its menus for now. It confirmed the lorry driver shortage was one reason behind the disruption. Its statement said: ""As reported, a number of issues are impacting retailers in the UK at the moment, one of which is the nationwide shortage of HGV drivers."" A wide range of businesses have reported problems with supplies because of the driver shortage. Last week, Nando's closed some outlets after running out of chicken. Earlier this month, a survey bythe Road Haulage Association (RHA) estimated there was a shortageof more than 100,000 drivers in the UK, out of a pre-pandemic total of about 600,000. The RHA has said some 30,000 HGV driving tests did not take place last year because of the coronavirus pandemic, adding that a ""historic"" shortage in drivers had been exacerbated by changes to rules following Brexit. More recently, drivers being told to self-isolate after being notified by the NHS Covid app have also added to the problem. Act now to end lorry driver crisis, government told How serious is the HGV driver shortage? Analysis of the latest ONS Labour Force Survey for the second quarter suggests that 14,000 EU lorry drivers left jobs in the UK in the year toâ¯June 2020, but only 600 had returned by July 2021. Firms from a number of sectors in the UK have been battling with a supply chain crisis due to a shortage of lorry drivers.On Friday, Logistics UK, which represents freight firms, and the British Retail Consortium (BRC) wrote to the government to plead for new measures to alleviate the problem. Tesco has been offering lorry drivers a Â£1,000 joining bonus amid a chronic shortage of drivers in the industry. Other companies are also understood to be offering similar incentives for HGV drivers after disruption to supply chains led to product shortages. Morrisons said it was working on schemes to train staff to become lorry drivers. A government spokesperson said last week it was bringing in a package of measures to help tackle the HGV driver shortage, including plans to streamline the process for new drivers to gain their HGV licence and to increase the number of tests that can be conducted. Although famous for its Big Macs and fries, McDonald's is actually one of the biggest drinks retailers in the UK. The shift towards McCafÃ©s and promotion of coffee sales was a deliberate policy in the last decade to try to bring in more customers outside of normal mealtimes. But faced with supply chain issues, it has decided to prioritise its big sellers at the expense of milkshakes. Because every element of the burger needs to be present in the production line, those deliveries are being secured. Bottled drinks can sit in a warehouse much longer without going out of date. The timing of this shortage coming in the summer holiday season has meant a higher number of customers will be disappointed at missing out on their milkshakes. It has also temporarily relaxed drivers' hours rules to allow HGV drivers to make slightly longer journeys. Other leading businesses have reported problems caused by driver shortages. Last week, Nando's was forced to close about 50 of its restaurants after running out of chicken. Rival KFC also warned recently that supply chain issues meant it was unable to stock some menu items. Dairy giant Arla has had to cut back on milk deliveries to supermarkets because of a shortage of drivers, while sweet producer Haribo also reported problems resulting from a shortage of drivers. Oil giant BP temporarily closed a ""handful"" of its UK sites because not enough unleaded petrol and diesel had been delivered. McDonald's apologised for any inconvenience and thanked customers for their patience.

"Online accommodation platform Airbnb has said it will temporarily house 20,000 Afghan refugees at no charge to help them resettle across the world. The company's boss said the move was in response to ""one of the biggest humanitarian crises of our time"". He said the firm felt a responsibility to step up. Chief executive Brian Chesky added: ""I hope this inspires other business leaders to do the same. There's no time to waste."" ""As tens of thousands of Afghan refugees resettle around the world, where they stay will be the first chapter in their new lives. For these 20,000 refugees, my hope is that the Airbnb community will provide them with not only a safe place to rest and start over, but also a warm welcome home,"" he said. The offer starts immediately and the company said it was working with non-governmental organisations ""on the ground"" to help with the most pressing needs. It has not specified how much the company plans to spend on the initiative or how long refugees will be housed for. But it said it would collaborate with resettlement agencies and partners ""to go where the need goes"" and evolve the initiative and its support as necessary. Where will all the Afghan refugees go? With just a suitcase, Afghans leave their homeland ""Starting today, Airbnb will begin housing 20,000 Afghan refugees globally for free,"" Mr Chesky tweeted on Tuesday. ""While we will be paying for these stays, we could not do this without the generosity of our hosts."" The company said the cost of the stays would be funded through contributions from Airbnb and Mr Chesky, as well as donors to the Airbnb.org Refugee Fund. He said: ""The displacement and resettlement of Afghan refugees in the US and elsewhere is one of the biggest humanitarian crises of our time."" Airbnb said it would release more details soon about how people might help. The company said: ""We know that Airbnb hosts and guests around the world will be eager to stand up and assist this massive effort - and in the coming days, Airbnb and Airbnb.org plan to share details on how hosts and the broader community can support this initiative."" Property owners who host Airbnb locations have long been encouraged to donate stays at their homes for ""people in crisis"". The scheme began in response to Hurricane Sandy in 2012, when more than 1,000 people needed emergency accommodation after New York city was hit. Since then, it claims to have helped more than 75,000 people. The company launched its Open Homes initiative in 2017 to allow its host community to offer their homes for free to people hit by disasters or fleeing conflict. The initiative has since offered free stays to people affected by the Mexico City earthquake, Californian wildfires, Australian bushfires and other disasters. It also led to the company setting up its own independent non-profit, Airbnb.org, to focus on helping people share housing and resources with each other in times of crisis. Last week, it gave emergency funding and support to the International Rescue Committee, HIAS and Church World Service to provide temporary stays for up to 1,000 arriving Afghan refugees. During the last weekend, it placed 165 refugees in safe housing shortly after touching down in the US. ""Accessible housing is urgently needed and essential,"" said David Miliband, president of the International Rescue Committee. Have you been affected by the issues raised in this story?

"McDonald's has run out of milkshakes and some bottled drinks at restaurants in England, Scotland and Wales. The fast-food chain said it was facing supply chain issues affecting the availability of shakes and bottled drinks at its 1,250 outlets. An updated statement said it was ""working hard"" to limit the impact on deliveries and customers and had taken some items off its menus for now. It confirmed the lorry driver shortage was one reason behind the disruption. Its statement said: ""As reported, a number of issues are impacting retailers in the UK at the moment, one of which is the nationwide shortage of HGV drivers."" A wide range of businesses have reported problems with supplies because of the driver shortage. Last week, Nando's closed some outlets after running out of chicken. Earlier this month, a survey bythe Road Haulage Association (RHA) estimated there was a shortageof more than 100,000 drivers in the UK, out of a pre-pandemic total of about 600,000. The RHA has said some 30,000 HGV driving tests did not take place last year because of the coronavirus pandemic, adding that a ""historic"" shortage in drivers had been exacerbated by changes to rules following Brexit. More recently, drivers being told to self-isolate after being notified by the NHS Covid app have also added to the problem. Act now to end lorry driver crisis, government told How serious is the HGV driver shortage? Analysis of the latest ONS Labour Force Survey for the second quarter suggests that 14,000 EU lorry drivers left jobs in the UK in the year toâ¯June 2020, but only 600 had returned by July 2021. Firms from a number of sectors in the UK have been battling with a supply chain crisis due to a shortage of lorry drivers.On Friday, Logistics UK, which represents freight firms, and the British Retail Consortium (BRC) wrote to the government to plead for new measures to alleviate the problem. Tesco has been offering lorry drivers a Â£1,000 joining bonus amid a chronic shortage of drivers in the industry. Other companies are also understood to be offering similar incentives for HGV drivers after disruption to supply chains led to product shortages. Morrisons said it was working on schemes to train staff to become lorry drivers. A government spokesperson said last week it was bringing in a package of measures to help tackle the HGV driver shortage, including plans to streamline the process for new drivers to gain their HGV licence and to increase the number of tests that can be conducted. Although famous for its Big Macs and fries, McDonald's is actually one of the biggest drinks retailers in the UK. The shift towards McCafÃ©s and promotion of coffee sales was a deliberate policy in the last decade to try to bring in more customers outside of normal mealtimes. But faced with supply chain issues, it has decided to prioritise its big sellers at the expense of milkshakes. Because every element of the burger needs to be present in the production line, those deliveries are being secured. Bottled drinks can sit in a warehouse much longer without going out of date. The timing of this shortage coming in the summer holiday season has meant a higher number of customers will be disappointed at missing out on their milkshakes. It has also temporarily relaxed drivers' hours rules to allow HGV drivers to make slightly longer journeys. Other leading businesses have reported problems caused by driver shortages. Last week, Nando's was forced to close about 50 of its restaurants after running out of chicken. Rival KFC also warned recently that supply chain issues meant it was unable to stock some menu items. Dairy giant Arla has had to cut back on milk deliveries to supermarkets because of a shortage of drivers, while sweet producer Haribo also reported problems resulting from a shortage of drivers. Oil giant BP temporarily closed a ""handful"" of its UK sites because not enough unleaded petrol and diesel had been delivered.

"Afghan refugees have been arriving in the US The US is being pressed by allies to delay its withdrawal from Afghanistan to allow more time for evacuating those who want to flee the country, now that it is run by Taliban militants. US troops controlling Kabul airport - the only one in the country functioning - are scheduled to leave by 31 August. The UK is hosting a G-7 summit, warning ""not everyone will get out"". The Taliban have warned of consequences if foreign forces remain after the deadline agreed with the US. Currently 5,800 US troops are on the ground. President Joe Biden is set to decide within the next 24 hours whether to extend their stay, an official told Reuters news agency. The US has evacuated, and facilitated the evacuation of, approximately 48,000 people since an intense airlift started on 14 August, the White House said. Others seeking to flee remain crammed in or near the international airport in the capital, Kabul. Many of the people fleeing, particularly those who worked with foreign forces, live in fear of reprisals from a group that imposed a harsh version of Islamic law when in power from 1996 to 2001. By Yogita Limaye, BBC South Asia correspondent Thousands of people, foreign nationals and Afghans, continue to throng the gates of Kabul airport. Amidst the crowds, even those with the right permits aren't able to get through. Some have been waiting there for days, with little shelter or food. At least 20 have been killed in shootings and stampedes at the airport since last week. More than 10,000 were evacuated on Monday, but time is running out. Elsewhere in Afghanistan, the BBC has spoken to people who have been in hiding out of fear they will be killed by the Taliban. They say they don't have the means to leave. There are millions who support the insurgent group as well, hoping they will bring an end to the violence. The Taliban have been holding discussions on forming a government. Markets and workplaces are slowly opening up. But banks are still closed and fewer women are visible on the streets. Johnson to urge world leaders to step up Afghan support Why can't the UK hold Kabul airport without the US? France, Germany and the UK have pressed for more time to complete the evacuations from Afghanistan. France's Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told reporters in the United Arab Emirates: ""We are concerned about the deadline set by the United States on August 31. Additional time is needed to complete ongoing operations."" Germany's Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said he had discussed keeping Kabul airport open beyond the deadline with Nato allies and the Taliban. On Tuesday, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to push the US for an extension during the virtual summit with other G7 leaders. But Defence Secretary Ben Wallace it would all depend on both the US and the Taliban. ""Our focus is to get as many people out,"" Mr Wallace said. ""But the scale of the challenge means that not everyone will get out. We are ruthlessly prioritising people."" This video can not be played Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen told the BBC that foreign troops staying past 31 August would be ""a clear violation"" Military advisers have told the White House that a decision must be made on Tuesday in order to allow for the troops, along with their equipment and weapons, to leave in time for the deadline, CNN reports. A defence official told the network that if Mr Biden agreed on withdrawing in time for the deadline,there would be ""a few more"" days of evacuating people,externalbefore the drawdown of troops began, possibly at the end of this week. REFUGEES:With just a suitcase, Afghans leave their homeland EXPLAINER:Who's who in the Taliban leadership According to the White House, about10,900 people were evacuated from Kabul,externalbetween 11:30 and 23:30 local time (07:00 - 19:00 GMT) on Monday. Images from Washington's Dulles Airport show Afghans arriving in the country. The Taliban have tried to paint a conciliatory picture for those Afghans who stay, asking them to help rebuild the country. Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen told the BBC people with passports  would still be able to leave on commercial flights after the deadline. He said: ""We want them to stay in the country but if they intend to go, they can."" The United Nations human rights council is set to meet in an emergency session on Tuesday to discuss Afghanistan. It comes amid warnings from aid agencies about the deepening humanitarian crisis in the country and concerns over human rights, in particular, the rights of women. The Taliban say they will respect the rights of women and girls but there are already reports of detentions and executions. Human rights groups say the UN must create an international, independent body to investigate what is happening. Tuesday's emergency human rights council session could do this - but the draft resolution, submitted by Pakistan does not go that far, says the BBC's Imogen Foulkes, in Geneva. The resolution asks the UN human rights chief to keep an eye on things, and report back in December. There are currently 5,800 US troops on the ground in Afghanistan The airlift began as the Taliban moved into Kabul following a lightning campaign in which they captured almost all of the country in the wake of the US decision to withdraw forces. The sole remaining area holding out appears to be the Panjshir region north-east of Kabul,a stronghold of anti-Taliban opponents who say thousands of people are ready to carry on the fight. The Taliban were ousted by US and allied troops following al-Qaeda's 11 September 2001 attacks. A 20-year conflict ensued.

"England and Wales record highest number of weekly Covid-related deaths since March - ONS First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says Scotland is at a ""fragile and pivotal"" moment in the pandemic She says 'limited and proportionate' restrictions could be reintroduced Scots are being asked for views on an independent inquiry into the handling of the pandemic Retail leaders are urging the UK government to follow Scotland's example in extending new protections for shop workers Breast milk of mothers who have had Covid-19 vaccines has significant level of antibodies - study Covid cases have risen sharply in French Polynesia, which is largely unvaccinated Edited by Paul Gribben We're now bringing our live page to a close for today. We'll be back with another live page on Wednesday. Our writers were Alex Therrien and Katie Wright. The page was edited by Paul Gribben We'll soon be bringing our live page to a pause for today. But before we do, here is a recap of the main coronavirus stories from today.  It is up to individual areas if they want to require visitors to take a Covid test before entering, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden has told the BBC. Cumbriaâs director of public health has called forpeople to ensure they test negative before holidaying in the area, and those travelling to the Lincolnshire coast are now being encouraged to do the same. Asked about this by the BBC while on a visit to Northern Ireland, Mr Dowden responded:  âOf course itâs up to individual areas what further precautions they take. ""But the key thing is, get that jab. That will enable people to have wonderful holidays just like the ones Iâve seen people having here"". Experienced staff will leave the NHS sooner than they might have if the government does not come up with a plan for the health service's recovery from the pandemic and its future, a senior health leader has warned. The president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine said she is ""genuinely not confident"" the government has a plan for the NHS, which is facing rising waiting lists and continued pressure from coronavirus cases. Dr Katherine Henderson said there must be a plan in the short term to manage public expectations and give staff a vision on ""somewhere that we're going"" and a longer term outline of how to resource the health service to provide the care people expect. If this does not happen soon, the most experienced people who are approaching retirement but are ""holding a lot of stuff together"" will ""bail out"", she said. She told the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Coronavirus: ""We can't limp from investigation to investigation, to criticism, to yet another scandal where workforce comes down to being the primary problem. ""We don't have enough people able to deliver the standard of care that we believe the NHS ought to be able to do."" She said while younger people will always come into the NHS, there will be employees with years of experience ""who will leave sooner than they should"". Tourists are being asked to stay away from Cornwall unless they have pre-booked their trip, the region's tourist board has warned. The South West has seen a recent spike in Covid-19 cases across Devon and Cornwall. The latest figures show Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly have 717 cases per 100,000 people. Malcolm Bell, head of Visit Cornwall, is calling on visitors to help keep the region safe. He said the county had witnessed ""too many occurrences of overcrowding in honey pots"" and urged visitors to consider visiting less popular parts.
""We have over 300 beaches and lovely parts that can cope with visitors,"" he said. Read morehere. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst China has recorded only one domestic coronavirus case today, and papers are lauding the success of the country reversing a widespread outbreak of the Delta variant. In mid-July, multiple workers at an international airport in Nanjing tested positive with the virus. By early August, the number of daily cases nationwide had reached triple digits, and official media said that cases had been detected in at least 17 of Chinaâs 31 provincial-level regions. Regional governments responded to this by instantly locking down communities where cases of the virus had been detected, and imposing travel restrictions. There were multiple rounds of city-wide Covid-19 tests in multiple cities to identify if neighbours and close contacts of confirmed cases were asymptomatic. The nationalGlobal Times,externalnewspaper said that the outbreak was regarded as the most widespread since the original Covid-19 outbreak in Wuhan, at the beginning of 2020. However, on Sunday, the National Health Commission said that the country hadrecorded zero confirmed cases,externalâfor the first time in over a monthâ, 35 days since the first case had been detected. The lockdown and mass-test approach has been somewhat routine in China, and the Xinhua News Agency says that âthis strategy has proven effective in rapidly controlling more than 20 imported outbreaksâ. China knows, however, that it canât lock down forever. Ithopes to reopen to the world by early 2022,external, provided that at least 80% of its 1.4 billion population are fully vaccinated. The breast milk of mothers who have had Covid-19 vaccines contains a significant level of antibodies that may help protect nursing babies from the virus, a small study suggests. When babies are born, their underdeveloped immune systems make it hard for them to fight infections on their own. They are also often too young to respond adequately to certain types of vaccines, experts say. For this study researchers recruited 21 lactating healthcare workers who had never contracted the virus. They sampled the mothers' breast milk and blood three times - before vaccination, after the first dose and after the second dose. There was a robust antibody response in blood and breast milk after the second dose - about a hundred-fold increase compared with levels before vaccination - the study found. Joseph Larkin III, senior author of the study and an associate professor at the University of Florida, said: ""Our findings show that vaccination results in a significant increase in antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 - the virus that causes Covid-19 - in breast milk, suggesting that vaccinated mothers can pass on this immunity to their babies, something we are working to confirm in our ongoing research.""  The daily figures released by the government are one of the ways Covid deaths are measured As we have been reporting, the latest ONS figures suggest coronavirus-related deaths in England and Wales in the week ending 13 August were at their highest levels since late March. The ONS counts deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate, even if the person had not been tested for the virus. By this measurement there have been 156,958 deaths since the pandemic began. Because death certificates take time to be registered, these figures are several weeks old by the time they are released. The other main way coronavirus deaths are counted is in the UK government's daily figures, which count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. By this measurement there have been 131,680 deaths. There is also a bit of a lag in these figures, although they are more up to date than the ONS data so are monitored by healthcare experts, scientists and politicians to help them decide on their next steps. The daily deaths figures have been growing even higher since the period covered by the ONS stats released today, with deaths now averaging above 100 a day over the past week. The daily figure will next be updated at 16:00 BST. Of course, talk of Scotland's intention to hold a public inquiry this year into how the pandemic has been handled in Scotland promots the queston of when the UK-wide independent public inquiry already announced by Boris Johnson will actually start. Scotland First Minister Nicola Sturgeon stressed that the Scottish government would ""liaise closely"" with the UK government and the other devolved administrations on the likely terms of a UK-wide inquiry to ""avoid duplication and overlap"". The prime minister has said he intends to launch the UK inquiry in spring 2022 - and has resisted calls to bring it forward. Earlier this year, Labour called for it to start this summer - but that was before the third wave of Covid took hold. And England's deputy chief medical officer, Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, has said that requiring medical experts and front-line workers to attend an inquiry at a time when Covid is still so prevalent would be ""an extra burden that wasn't necessary"". The exact aims and remit of the inquiry - known as the terms of reference - will be announced closer to the start of the inquiry next year. This is partly to allow time for the UK government to work with the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland on deciding its exact scope. Read more about how the UK inquiry will workhere. Covid has been mentioned on the death certificate of nearly 10,500 people in Scotland Here is what we know about Scotland's plans to hold its own public inquiry into the handling of the Covid pandemic: Samantha Willis died two weeks after giving birth Pregnant women are being urged to get vaccinated after a woman from Northern Ireland died with Covid-19 two weeks after giving birth. The funeral of Samantha Willis was held on Monday.The mother-of-four died in intensive care on Friday, after spending 16 days in hospital with Covid-19. Dr David Farren, an infection control doctor, said hospitals were now ""constantly"" seeing pregnant women with Covid. Speaking to BBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster programme, Dr Farren said: ""Now the majority do well but we do see occasionally people ending up in intensive care, having to have their babies delivered early and last week we saw a tragic death."" ""Enough's enough. Pregnant women need to get their vaccine,"" he said. Dr Farren said he could understand the initial hesitancy of pregnant women to get vaccinated because there had been ""mixed messages"". However, he added: ""People need to start trusting their doctors, their midwives, their nurses and not listening to people who have spent 30 minutes on the internet and decided it's not safe.""

Eden's case rate has doubled over the last week A plea to visitors to take lateral flow tests before coming to Cumbria may have an impact on bookings at a ""crucial time"", a tourism chief has warned. The area's director of public health Colin Cox said tourists should ensure they were virus-free as a ""courtesy"" after a spike of cases in Eden. Alison Magee-Barker, who works with tourism and hospitality firms, said asking visitors to take tests could result in a loss of business. She said: ""Potentially it could put people off and we're coming up to a winter season where we really fight for guests. ""We've had such a hard time in the hospitality industry over the last 18 months with restrictions and guidelines. This could be another nail in the coffin."" Read morehere. About 600,000 young Scots will be able to get dental care free of charge, as the Scottish Government has pledged more cash to help that sector recover from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Dentists are to get a further Â£7.5m of funding, with the government cash allowing practices to buy new drills, which do not generate as much aerosol as standard drills, reducing the risks of spreading Covid-19. The funding was announced at the same time as Health Secretary Humza Yousaf confirmed all those under the age of 26 are now eligible for free dental care. Nicola Sturgeon is taking questions from journalists, and she is asked what impact schools and universities returning will have on Covid cases in Scotland and the NHS. The first minister says there are less hospitalisations currently - adding that when cases are high, a small percentage of those cases will still result in a large number of people becoming seriously ill. She also says the NHS is trying to return to normal so the margins of tolerance to deal with Covid are smaller than at the start of the pandemic when hospitals were cleared to deal with the virus. She adds that it will take less for the NHS to face significant pressures. Sturgeon says the vaccine is providing a shield but the virus is still trying ""to beat us"". ""I don't underestimate how difficult this is but nobody can wave a magic wand and make it all go away,"" she says. Scotland's first minister says there has been a ""sharp rise"" in cases with new cases more than doubling over the past week. Nicola Sturgeon says it is one of the sharpest rises the country has experienced at any point during the pandemic. ""Today's figure is the largest recorded in a single day though it is worth remembering that we do more testing now than was the case in the early stages of the pandemic,"" she says. She says that if the surge continues and accelerates and there is an increase in serious illness, she cannot rule out having to re-impose some restrictions. However, the first minister says she hopes not to have to do that and, if she does, the restrictions will be as limited and proportionate as possible. The country is at another ""fragile and pivotal moment"" in the pandemic, she adds. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is holding her coronavirus update. She begins by going through Tuesday's coronavirus figures. The first minister says there were 4,323 cases reported on Monday - the equivalent of 14.5% of all tests carried out. She says 364 people are in hospital - a rise of eight since yesterday and 43 people are in intensive care, two more than on Monday. A further 10 deaths have been recorded - that takes the total number of deaths registered under this daily measurement to 8,080. As of this morning 4,085,552 people have received one dose while 3,587,145 have received both doses. Around 80% of over-18s have now had both doses - and 95% of over-40s. She says these are ""genuinely remarkable"" figures. A statement on behalf of members of the Scottish branch of the UK group Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice welcomed the Scottish government's plans for a Covid inquiry. It says: ""The families are grateful that the Scottish government has listened to their demands and an independent Scottish public inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the deaths and the subsequent handling of the Covid pandemic will now take place."" It adds: ""Today is the first important step in establishing accountability for 10,421 lives lost to Covid-19 in Scotland."" It says that the core priority is to get the public inquiry up and running by the end of this calendar year. Scots are being asked for their views on an independent inquiry into the handling of the coronavirus pandemic. The Scottish government says it will be established by the end of the year to look at decisions and learn lessons for future pandemics. Particular consideration will be given to cases and deaths in care homes, the impact on education and the economy. The public are being encouraged to share their ideas and comments on email by 30 September. Deputy First Minister John Swinney said discussions were also ongoing with the UK government on the planned four nations inquiry. Read more detailshere. Long Covid patients in north Wales are helping the area's health board tailor a wide range of treatments to support fellow sufferers. Long Covid is defined as symptoms continuing for more than 12 weeks after an initial infection. About 15% of Covid patients are thought to be affected and, while not all will need ongoing treatment, many will. The Long Recovery Programme Group will feature regular meetings between staff and patients at Betsi Cadwaladr Health Board to hear first-hand accounts of health problems. One 38-year-old health worker now needs crutches to walk nearly 18 months after she first contracted Covid. Read morehere. The population of the Pacific territory of French Polynesia is largely unvaccinated Covid infections are soaring in the sparsely-populated Pacific territory of French Polynesia, with health authorities reporting 54 deaths from the virus over the weekend as the Delta variant spreads among a largely unvaccinated population. More than 300 people have died from Covid-19 since the pandemic hit the remote archipelago, home to 280,000 inhabitants. More than half of those deaths have come in the last three weeks. The territory has so far recorded 7,591 infections, although the true figure is likely to be higher as most asymptomatic people are not being tested. High rates of diabetes and obesity have made the population more vulnerable. The territory's limited health care system has struggled to cope, with one major hospital setting up beds in hallways to handle the rising number of patients. Bodies have been loaded onto refrigerator trucks to relieve pressure on the overwhelmed morgue. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played The BBC's Lyse Doucet reports from Kabul airport, where many Afghans are fleeing the Taliban regime It hits you like a brick as soon as you put your foot on the tarmac at Kabul international airport. The intensity, the urgency, the darkness of this hour. In every direction, there are the huge grey military transport planes from the US and many other countries. Military helicopters are in the sky. Heading towards every single plane are long queues of Afghans. The lines don't seem to end. They have been told they can only bring one suitcase and the clothes they are wearing, as they leave their country behind - the country now controlled by the Taliban. But it's not just the country they are leaving. They are leaving behind the life they lived, and for the young educated generation, the life they built up, the dreams they cherished over 20 years. There are said to be 14,000 people inside this airfield, controlled by US military, waiting to board. Freelance journalist Bilal Sarwary was among those who made it onto the airfield, having left behind everything he had worked so hard to build, save for a few pairs of clothes and his young family.

Sarwary, a former BBC journalist, had planned to raise his daughter - named Sola, meaning ""peace"" - in his home country, the place he has spent 20 years covering, starting as a fixer and translator in 2001. Instead, he is hoping she will one day understand the decision he has made to leave. ""Today's the day that a generation of Afghans have buried their dreams and aspirations and our lives,"" he said. ""This city to us is our home, despite its contradictions we called it home, we're raised from here. We hope the Taliban can learn from the lessons of the pastâ¦ and we can prove that we can move away from the tanks and bullets, towards a road where everyone can see themselves."" About 17,000 people have left Afghanistan via Kabul airport in the last week, according to the US. It is not known how many were Afghan citizens given visas for their work with international governments and organisations amid fears they may be targeted by the Taliban. Many are professionals and graduates, and Sarwary fears what this ""brain drain"" will mean for Afghanistan. Afghanistan, he said, was ""a country where good people, they don't grow on trees"". Outside the airport gates, there are another 10,000 or more hoping to get onto the airfield - a crush of people wanting to leave however they can. The longer it has taken, the more desperate the crowd has become. Reporters at the scene describe Saturday as one of the worst days, with several women known to have lost their lives as the people surged forward. According to Nato, they are among the at least 20 people who have died in and around the airport since the Taliban entered the city a week ago. Sunday was reported to be calmer at the gates, although witnesses report Taliban fighters firing into the air and using batons in order to keep people in line, according to news agency Reuters. Internationally, concerns continue to grow that countries will not be able to get their people - nationals and the Afghans who have worked alongside them - out before the end of the month, at which point the US has said it will pull out. On Saturday the European Union's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned that it was ""mathematically impossible"" to evacuate so many in the next nine days. As for Bilal Sarwary, he was adamant that just because he was leaving, it did not mean he was ready to give up. ""Our affair with Afghanistan is the affair of fatal love, no matter what happens we will never give up on it,"" he said.

"Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi has halted plans to launch in the UK and continental Europe, a source close to the company has told the BBC. The Uber rival had been planning to roll out services in Western Europe, including major British cities. Didi is in consultation with the team working on the project about assigning new roles or potential redundancies. The move comes as Chinese firms face intense scrutiny by Western nations and Beijing cracks down on data privacy. Didi did not comment directly on the story that was first reported by The Daily Telegraph but said in a statement: ""We continue to explore additional new markets, liaising with relevant stakeholders in each and being thoughtful about when to introduce our services."" ""As soon as we have any more news on additional new markets, we look forward to sharing,"" the spokesperson added. Didi has been expanding its international business and has recently launched services in a number of new countries in South Africa, Ecuador and Kazakhstan. In response to questions about the future of its team in the UK Didi said: ""We have established an international talent hub in the UK, recognising the exceptional quality of people in the market. Beyond that, any personnel matters remain strictly confidential."" Didi's decision comes as Chinese companies face increasingly close attention from authorities in Western countries. Last year, telecoms giant Huawei was banned from the UK's 5G infrastructure and faces scrutiny over its security practices from Britain's National Cyber Security Centre. Huawei is also one of the Chinese companies hit by tough restrictions in the US. Under the Trump administration firms including the hugely popular video-sharing app were targeted over allegations of links to the Chinese government. While President Biden has eased back on some of that rhetoric Washington is still keeping up the pressure on Chinese firms. At the same time Didi has come under intense scrutiny in China as Beijing is increasingly cracking down on data privacy. Earlier this year, the country's internet regulator ordered online stores to stop offering its app, saying it illegally collected users' personal data. The announcement came just two days after the company raised $4.4bn (Â£3.21bn) in its New York Stock Exchange debut. Didi's shares fell sharply on the news. The Chinese government is also introducing broader measures to protect data privacy. On Friday, the country's top legislative body, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, passed a sweeping new privacy law. The Personal Information Protection Law aims to strictly control data collection by technology firms and will take effect from 1 November.

"Retail leaders are urging the UK government to follow Scotland's example in extending new protections for shop workers. The Protection of Workers Act comes into force in Scotland on Tuesday, which makes assaulting or abusing retail staff a standalone offence. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) and union Usdaw want similar rules to be introduced across the rest of the UK. BRC boss Helen Dickinson said ""enough is enough"". ""It is incomprehensible that despite Holyrood's decisive action, the UK government has so far failed to provide the same protections to shop workers in the rest of the UK,"" the head of the trade group said. Ms Dickinson added that the BRC would ""not stop until our asks are met"". Violence against shop staff increasing, survey says Shop worker abused 'every day for a year' The new Scottish law, which was passed unanimously, will also see tougher sentences for perpetrators. Usdaw is also calling on the government to bring forward an amendment to extend the same protections to retail staff in England, Wales and Northern Ireland when its policing bill goes to the House of Lords for a second reading in September. Its general secretary, Paddy Lillis, said shop workers face ""violence, threats and abuse"" on a regular basis. This has been exacerbated by staff being asked to enforce Covid-related measures such as social distancing or mask-wearing during the pandemic, Usdaw said. Michelle Whitehead has worked at the same supermarket for the last 20 years ""We've always had abuse against us, but since the pandemic it has gotten so much worse,"" says Michelle Whitehead, who has worked at the same supermarket in Wolverhampton for two decades. After politely asking customers to wear a face mask when restrictions were in place, or explaining why certain items were out of stock, she has faced both verbal and physical abuse. One male customer told her he would wait for her after closing. Others have threatened to hit her with a walking stick and spat at her. ""I have come home and cried because of it... I enjoy my job and love most of the customers - I just want to get on with it,"" she says. She would like to see a tougher stance taken in England: ""It would make people stop and think before they shouted and bawled at us because they might be prosecuted - it'd save me coming home crying. ""Most of the abusers don't realise we're actually people... It'd be nice to have a clear message to say: 'We're shop workers and assaulting and abusing us is totally unacceptable.'"" According to the BRC'sannual crime survey,external, the number of violent or abusive incidents rose to 455 a day between 1 April 2019 and 31 March 2020, in comparison with 424 in the previous year. That was despite shops spending a record Â£1.2bn on safety measures such as security staff, body cameras and panic alarms, it said. Last month, 100 retail bosses wroteto the prime minister demanding action. Leaders of brands such as Tesco, Sainsbury's, Aldi and Ikea signed an open letter saying the situation ""cannot be allowed to get any worse"". They added there was ""a clear need now for better protection in law for retail workers"". A Home Office spokeswoman said: ""It is completely unacceptable to threaten or assault shop workers, not least when they are working so hard to keep vital services running."" She cited the launch of the #ShopKind campaign in April to encourage customers to treat shop workers with respect. ""The Sentencing Council has set out guidelines which means courts should increase sentences for assaults committed against all those providing a service to the public, which includes shop workers,"" she added.

"Shop worker Tracey Davies had said dealing with abuse every day was exhausting ""I've been spat at and was worried I might die of Covid."" Shop worker Tracey Davies said her depression flared back up after abuse from customers during the pandemic. Now the Welsh government and the shop worker's union is calling for greater protection for UK retail staff asnew laws come into force in Scotland. The Home Office said new guidelines meant courts should increase sentences for assaults against people providing a service to the public, like shop staff. Research from Usdaw, which represents 380,000 shop workers in the UK, suggests more than than 90% of their members had suffered abuse, more than two-thirds threatened, and one in seven assaulted. Shop worker abused 'every day for a year' Supermarkets shut off non-essential items in Wales Ms Davies, 51, from Neath, said while customers in her store had ""got a lot better"", abuse she received throughout the pandemic had triggered relapses in her depression. A union says its research suggested one in seven shop workers had been assaulted She said she received abuse from about five people every day. ""I was doing my regular job, a gentleman came in, I asked him for ID, he didn't have it so he proceeded to spit in my face in the middle of a pandemic."" She said she washed repeatedly as the incident made her feel ""violently ill"". The shop worker is calling on people to ""simply be kind"". ""That's all I'm asking. If everyone was kind, I wouldn't be in this mess."" Some shop staff have said they have been abused bycustomers while trying to enforce government face mask rules. Supermarket workers have also spoken out abouthaving to ""referee"" what could and could not be bought in shopsafter the Welsh government banned the sale of non-essential items like clothes, toys and electrical goods last year. One worker from mid Wales told an Usdaw survey they had been ""rammed with trolleys on purpose"" while one deaf worker in west Wales said customers had told them they should not be working. Some supermarket aisles were closed off during Wales' firebreak lockdown last year One supermarket giant revealed a 76% rise in reports of antisocial behaviour and verbal abuse towards its staff in 2020, withmore than 100 incidents at Co-op storesevery day. The Welsh government wants to follow the Scottish government's route and introduce tougher laws for perpetrators of abuse and violence towards shop staff but it is not a devolved power in Wales so is under the jurisdiction of Westminster. ""Any abuse directed at staff who are doing their job and helping to keep customers safe is completely unacceptable,"" said a Welsh government spokesperson. ""We support Usdaw's call for greater protections for shop workers, and with criminal justice currently reserved to the UK government, we urge them to bring forward the necessary legislation."" A law protecting shop workers would ""be amazing because we do mean something and we are important"", Jane Jones says Jane Jones, a checkout supervisor from Mold, said workers had ""always been abused"" but it had escalated since the pandemic began. The mother-of-two who has worked in retail for about 20 years said: ""You can be really anxious going to work. ""You're building yourself up to it before you go because you know what's coming."" Mrs Jones said that meant being sworn at, having items thrown at staff, and people moving closer to them when being asked to keep their distance. She said this had left colleagues reduced to tears and needing to take time off work due to stress and anxiety. Usdaw's general secretary called abuse against shop workers a ""disgrace"" Supermarket workers facing coronavirus 'abuse' Don't allow shop abuse to worsen, bosses tell PM ""It is heartbreaking to hear these testimonies from Welsh shop workers who deserve far more respect than they receive,"" said Paddy Lillis, Usdaw's general secretary. ""Our latest survey results clearly show the scale of the appalling violence, threats and abuse faced by shop workers and demonstrate the need for a 'protection of shop workers' law."" Linda Richards says the whole of the UK should have the same laws to protect shop workers As a union representative, Linda Richards said ""more and more people"" had come to her after suffering abusive treatment from some customers. She said the law introduced in Scotland should be the same ""across the board"". ""If you can't respect people, you should be held accountable for that."" The UK government said the Sentencing Council's revised assault guidelines were published in May and required courts to treat an offence committed against those working in the public sector or providing a service to the public as an aggravating factor, making the offence more serious. ""It is completely unacceptable to threaten or assault shop workers, not least when they are working so hard to keep vital services running,"" said a Home Office spokesperson. ""We are putting 20,000 extra police officers into our communities to cut crime - including retail crime - and we launched the Shop Kind campaign in April to provide better support to victims and encourage customers to treat shop workers with dignity and respect. ""The Sentencing Council has set out guidelines which means courts should increase sentences for assaults committed against all those providing a service to the public, which includes shop workers.""

"Conwy Castle and the walls of the town are part of one of Wales' World Heritage sites Five areas in Wales are vying to be named UK City of Culture 2025. The winner could see more sustainable jobs and more tourism opportunities, according to business lecturer Kelly Young. Bangor and the north-west of Wales, Conwy county, Wrexham county, Powys and Newport are all bidding from Wales. Alongside them are a record 15 other areas that have expressed interest in the title, which will be announced in May 2022. At the end of 2021 the long list will be shortened to only a few candidates before the final decision is made. Coventry currently holds the City of Culture title until 2025 The aim of the competition, run by the UK government, is to highlight cultural hubs and success beyond the London area and put places on the map. Winning the title could give huge benefits to the local area, according to Dr Young, principal lecturer in business at Cardiff Metropolitan University. Record number of bids for UK City of Culture Swansea 'disappointed' to lose culture bid Wales' slate landscape wins World Heritage status ""Places like Hull who started the British version of the city of culture saw an increase of some Â£300 million of investment into their economy in 2017. ""I would say this system definitely has an impact on the economies and tourism of an area,"" she said. From Londonderry to Hull and to Coventry, all three previous or current cities of culture have reported an increase in investment. But which are the candidates in Wales for 2025 and what have they to offer? Garth Pier is a Grade II listed structure in Bangor, first opened in 1896 The city of Bangor's bid also includes some of the Gwynedd quarry areas and across to parts of Anglesey. With the area already on the map following its newWorld Heritage status for the slate industry landscape, why should Bangor receive the title? ""Bangor is such a multicultural city,"" said Rhian Cahill, visitor experience manager at Penrhyn Castle. ""The infrastructure and wealth that was put in has built it up to connect it with the rest of the world. ""When you work with people in the community it's really in their blood, it's like you could cut them in halve and there would be slate there."" Gwrych Castle gained new prominence as home of ITV's I'm a Celebrity during the pandemic Conwy county includes the Victorian promenades of Llandudno and Colwyn Bay. There are famous castles such as Conwy and Gwrych and also the wide-ranging mountains in the Conwy Valley. ""We have so much to offer,"" said county councillor Louise Emery. ""Our historical background and the Welsh language which flows through the daily lives of all residents. ""If we can create the culture and the feel then we think we can provide a much more varied offer to visitors and get them to come here all year round, not just in the peak summer season."" The Pontcysyllte Aqueduct near Wrexham is one of Wales' World Heritage sites Wrexham has been on the map for some months following the takeover of the football club by Hollywood stars Rob McElhenney and Ryan Reynolds. But local people also say the culture here runs deep in the local communities. ""For us it's just great"", said Llinos Ann Cleary, one of the board members at Theatr y Stiwt in Rhosllanerchrugog. ""The fact we have somewhere like this that has been in the village for 86 years, and we do so much here. ""We have the choirs that come, we have concerts, wrestling and a complete broad spectrum of cultural things and I just think it's great for us for that to be seen."" Crickhowell in Powys hosts the Green Man festival, one of Wales' largest outdoor music events The county of Powys makes up around a quarter of the landscape of Wales. It is home to many cultural events like the Green Man festival and the Royal Welsh Agricultural Show but what would city of culture status bring to an area like this? ""This is going to be an excuse to bring people together, to create together and to celebrate what Powys can be"", said county councillor Myfanwy Alexander. ""Plus we have, for example, difficulties attracting some people to the professional roles here in the area and that's because they don't know what Powys is like. ""We would like people to learn about Powys so when they next see a holiday or a job advertised they don't' say 'where' but they say 'oh that's the place that did that fantastic stuff'."" Newport staged the golf's Ryder Cup in 2010 and the Nato Summit in 2014 If successful the city of Newport and the wider region would also host a year-long programme of events and projects. Described as the gateway to south Wales, residents say it has many things to offer. Kayley Sydenham won the literature prize at the online Urdd Eisteddfod T in 2021. As a Newport local she hopes the bid will be a boost to the Welsh language in the area. ""I do use Newport as a bit of an inspiration in my writing,"" she said. ""A lot of poems in Welsh talk about the Welsh language dying but I do tend and really enjoy writing about the Welsh language but take a different side of it. It's there but we need to use it more"" She also says the Roman history and heritage combined with other local traditions make the area a brilliant spot for the City of Culture 2025.
