"Bitcoin's value has been very volatile during its nine-year history The value of digital currency Bitcoin is making headlines again. Amid volatile trade in November and December, it hit a peak of more than $17,000 at one point - a staggering rise, given that it started the year at $1,000. So what exactly is Bitcoin, and what's behind the buying frenzy? There are two key traits of Bitcoin: it is digital and it is seen as an alternative currency. Unlike the notes or coins in your pocket, it largely exists online. Although there are some specialist ATMs which issue bitcoins, it may be best to think of them as being more like virtual tokens. And secondly, Bitcoin is not printed by governments or traditional banks. That means it is ""not legal tender, you can't pay your taxes or use it to settle debts"", says Dr Garrick Hileman of the Judge Business School at University of Cambridge. Bitcoin - risky bubble or the future? Bitcoin crosses $10,000 milestone Bitcoins are created through a complex process known as ""mining"", and then monitored by a network of computers across the world. There's a steady stream of about 3,600 new bitcoins a day - with about 16.5 million now in circulation. However, like all currencies its value is determined by how much people are willing to buy and sell it for. No one is entirely sure. Some say it's a classic economic bubble: frenzied investors paying far more for an asset than it's worth for fear of missing out. They put it in the same bracket as the mania for Dutch tulip bulbs in the 1630s or internet companies in the dot.com boom. Others point to the growing prospect of Bitcoin crossing over into the financial mainstream. ""Speculation is a big part of this, but there are signs of growing use,"" says Dr Hileman. He says there were between three and six million people around the world actively using crypto-currency in April. ""Today it's probably closer to 10 to 20 million, so it's a very quickly growing user base,"" he says. That's the equivalent of a population the size of the Netherlands or Chile. There has also been a boost by some large financial institutions, like the owner of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, getting into the space, he adds. There are now thousands of different crypto-currencies, but Bitcoin is still the best-known. To receive a bitcoin a user must have a Bitcoin address - a string of 27 to 34 letters and numbers. This acts as a kind of virtual postbox to and from which the bitcoins are sent. There is no registry linking real names to addresses, which helps some Bitcoin users to protect their anonymity. Bitcoin wallets store the addresses and are used to manage savings. They operate like privately-run bank accounts - with the proviso that if the data is lost, so are the bitcoins owned. Increasingly, users are often asked for ID to open a wallet. The rules underpinning Bitcoin say that only 21 million bitcoins can be created - and that figure is getting ever nearer. It is unclear what will happen to the value of bitcoins when that limit is reached. The anonymity afforded by digital currencies has attracted people wanting to make illegal purchases on the internet. However, a small but growing number of recognised businesses now allow customers to buy goods and services with Bitcoin. They range from multinational firms like Microsoft and travel booking site Expedia, through to small businesses using it as something of a novelty, such as a sushi restaurant in Cambridge or an art gallery in London. This video can not be played ""Accepting crypto-currencies broadens my client-base,"" says Eleesa Dadiani It is not the same as established currencies, like the US dollar, which can be used across the world to buy a coffee or pay for a hotel room. A 900% rise in one year for a traditional currency would have major repercussions for consumers' spending power and the businesses that accept it. But many Bitcoin owners don't use it to buy things. ""The vast majority of users - I would estimate upwards of 80% or 90% - get into the space for investment reasons,"" says Dr Hileman. ""So you see the term 'crypto-asset' being used to describe Bitcoin more than 'crypto-currency' these days."" At the moment Bitcoin is largely unregulated, says Bradley Rice, an expert in financial regulation at the law firm Ashurst. It has been widely used on the dark web, which cannot be accessed via a normal internet browser without using a workaround. There are also concerns about its volatility. The chart below compares Bitcoin to the pound and euro. All the values start at 100 to compare the currencies more clearly. Because of Bitcoin's much faster growth, the chart uses a different approach on the y-axis where the smaller the gap, the faster the increase. China and South Korea have serious worries. They have banned the launch of new virtual currencies via so-called ""initial coin offerings"" - where companies or individuals issue their own digital currencies for investors to buy - and have been shutting down exchanges on which they are traded. The UK's Financial Conduct Authority warned investors in September they could lose all their money if they buy digital currencies issued by firms, known as ""initial coin offerings"". But the underlying technology of Bitcoin is regarded by some major financial institutions as bullet-proof. ""That's potentially why financial regulators [in Europe] are adopting largely a 'wait and see' approach,"" says Mr Rice. There is no shortage of financial journalists or experts saying Bitcoin's surge is a bubble. ""There may be good reasons for buying bitcoin,"" an article in The Economist said recently. ""But the dominant reason at the moment is that it is rising in price."" At the height of tulip mania, a single bulb sold for more than the value of a house Bitcoin has doubled in value in the space of a month - which has led some to argue it is too volatile to be seen as a currency, and warned that a crash is inevitable. However, Bitcoin has been ""declared dead"" a few times already, says Dr Hileman. ""It's shown some resilience and bounced back from some near-death experiences,"" he says. At the same time, many would agree this is ""very bubbly"", and he predicts we may see a ""spectacular crash again in the not-too-distant future"". ""So hang on tight if you are a holder of these currencies,"" he concludes. Bitcoin - risky bubble or the future? Is this the next financial scandal waiting to happen?

"Neil is known as one of the BBC's most ferocious political interviewers The Andrew Neil Show will disappear from BBC schedules as part of cuts to the corporation's news operation. The political discussion programme had already been off the air during the Covid-19 crisis and will not return. But the BBC said it was talking to Neil about a new BBC One interview show. In total, 520 jobs will go, from a workforce of around 6,000 people. That includes 450 job cuts that wereannounced as part of an Â£80m savings drive in January, andthen put on hold. Meanwhile,The Guardian has announced,externalthat it will cut 180 jobs, including 70 from editorial teams. Most of the changes will take place behind the scenes. The corporation's head of news, Fran Unsworth, said the BBC would concentrate on fewer stories, with journalists pooled in centralised teams, rather than working for specific programmes. The BBC News Channel and BBC World will continue to share some output in the mornings and evenings, as they have done during the Covid-19 crisis, although they will remain separate channels. Radio 4 programme In Business will close, as will the Business Live page on the BBC News Website, while bespoke business news bulletins on the BBC News channel will be reduced. On BBC World Service, World Update and The World This Week will end, while daily current affairs show Newsday will shorten in length. The BBC also said it would close most of its social accounts to focus on core services like@bbcnews,external,@bbcworld,externaland@bbcbreaking,external. One of Neil's former programmes, lunchtime TV show Politics Live, will return four days a week after being rested during the pandemic. More than 100 MPs and peers recently wrote to the BBC, arguing that axing it permanently would ""seriously harm the ability of the BBC to scrutinise and explain"" politics. The BBC says it will have fewer reporters overall, but that a new commissioning system (which was partly implemented during the Covid-19 crisis) will make sure coverage is better co-ordinated. More interviews will be conducted by Skype, Zoom and other video technologies, meaning there's less reliance on satellite trucks and radio cars. A new original journalism team will also be created, incorporating several staff from the Victoria Derbyshire show, to pursue under-reported and exclusive stories. There will also be a greater focus on digital storytelling. The coronavirus pandemic means the BBC must save a further Â£125m this year Unsworth said Covid-19 had ""changed all of our lives"" and had also ""led us to re-evaluate exactly how we operate as an organisation"". She said: ""Our operation has been underpinned by the principles we set out earlier this year - fewer stories, more targeted and with more impact. For BBC News to thrive, and for us to continue to serve all our audiences, we have to change."" After the announcement,the corporation revealed,externalthat legal correspondent Clive Coleman has decided to leave the BBC at the end of the year. The BBC announced in 2016 that it needed to save Â£800m, with around Â£80m of that figure coming from News. Just over Â£40m - around half of the savings required - has been found over the past four years. In January, the corporation announced plans to close 450 jobs, as well as programmes like BBC Two's highly-regarded Victoria Derbyshire show. The Derbyshire show's award-winning investigations included an expose on sexual abuse in football The cuts were later postponedas the newsroom faced the demands of covering the coronavirus pandemic. At the same time, the BBC delayed a decision to end free TV licences for the over-75s. That contributed to a further budget shortfall, meaning that the number of proposed job losses in news has increased by 70 posts. A separate decision to cut 450 jobs in the BBC's regional newsroomswas announced earlier this month. Neil has been one of the BBC's top political broadcasters over the past two decades on shows like This Week and Daily Politics. The Andrew Neil Show began in autumn 2019 in the run-up to the general election and the UK's departure from the European Union. It included interviews with most party leaders, but Prime Minister Boris Johnson did not appear - leading the host tocontroversially deliver an on-air ultimatum. Announcing the latest cuts, the BBC said: ""We remain committed to Andrew Neil's in-depth interviews (as well as the Budget, US Election and other Specials). ""The Andrew Neil Show will not be returning but we're in discussions about a new interview series on BBC One."" Neil had previously told the Radio Times he feared he would become ""surplus to requirements"" as the BBC made cutbacks. Today we have fresh details on the radical experiment that BBC News announced in January. Two big things have changed because of coronavirus. It has accentuated the BBC's financial strain, and shown a different way of working is possible. Both help account for the rise in likely redundancies. The fact that Politics Live will come back for four days a week will appease many in Westminster - but the loss of The Andrew Neil Show will have the opposite effect. That show was originally commissioned because of an intervention by Tony Hall, but he is leaving as director general in September. The BBC says Neil's in-depth interviews are still key to its coverage, and they would like to find a slot on BBC One for those interviews. There is no one correct way to conduct interviews. The right approach depends on the interviewer, the interviewee, and the context. But in one particular style - forensic, unrelenting scrutiny and interrogation of those in power - Neil is the best in the business. His talks with the BBC are far from resolved. Two fresh proposals have run aground. He will no longer do Politics Live - but has been approached by other broadcasters. Broadcasting union Bectu said it would hold BBC management to account and seek to avoid compulsory redundancies. ""BBC News is one of the most trusted brands at home and abroad. In an era of fake news and during an unprecedented health crisis this trust in a public service broadcaster is critical,"" said Bectu head, Philippa Childs. ""The government needs to take back responsibility for free licence fees for the over-75s, providing precious resources that would allow BBC News to continue to provide its world-leading range of news broadcasting.""

"Jen Reid posed with her statue, which appeared on the empty plinth on Wednesday A sculpture of a Black Lives Matter protester, placed on the plinth where a slave trader's statue was toppled, will be removed, Bristol's mayor has said. The sculpture of Jen Reid was erected early on Wednesday at the spot in the citywhere an Edward Colston statue was pulled downduring protests last month. Ms Reid had been photographed standing on the empty plinth. Mayor Marvin Rees said it was up to the people of Bristol to decide what would replace the Colston statue. How many statues of black people does the UK have? Artist Marc Quinn said his black resin statue, called A Surge of Power, was meant to be a temporary installation to continue the conversation about racism. He said he was inspired to create it after seeing an image of Ms Reid standing on the plinth with her fist raised during the Black Lives Matter protest on 7 June. Mr Quinn then contacted Ms Reid through social media and they worked together on the statue, which was erected shortly before 04:30 BST. The new statue has has attracted people both supporting it and those against BBC producer Alex Littlewood said people had been gathering around the Jen Reid statue for most of Wednesday, with many coming to take a knee. ""Most people have been supportive of the statue, but for a short time this afternoon a small amount of people arrived calling for the statue to be removed, saying it was an act of vandalism,"" he added. Mr Rees, the city's elected mayor, said removing the new statue was ""critical to building a city that is home to those who are elated at the [Colston] statue being pulled down, those who sympathise with its removal... and those who feel that in its removal, they've lost a piece of the Bristol they know"". He added the sculpture was the work and decision of a London-based artist, ""was not requested and permission was not given for it to be installed"". Allow Twitter content?

Councillor Cleo Lake said while she welcomed the arrival of the statue, she agreed the long term future of the plinth should be decided by the people of Bristol. She said: ""I expect the statue will be a temporary intervention and it is great to hear that should the statue be sold then the money raised will in part go towards the Cargo education project set to be rolled out in Bristol secondary schools this September."" Jen Reid was pictured standing on top of the plinth after the Colston statue was pulled down on 7 June Ms Reid said: ""I think it's something the people of Bristol really appreciate seeing. ""My husband took the photo on the day of the protests and put it on his social media. He was contacted by Marc Quinn who then contacted myself. ""I was in his studio by the Friday after the protest with 201 cameras surrounding me, taking pictures of me from every conceivable angle. That went into a 3D print and a mould was made."" Ms Reid said the sculpture was important because it helped ""keep the journey towards racial justice and equality moving"". People in Bristol stopped to take photos of the new statue She said she had felt an ""overwhelming impulse"" to climb on to the plinth during last month's protest. ""When I was stood there on the plinth, and raised my arm in a Black Power salute, it was totally spontaneous,"" she said. ""I didn't even think about it. It was like an electrical charge of power was running through me. ""This sculpture is about making a stand for my mother, for my daughter, for black people like me."" Artist Marc Quinn's previous works include a sculpture entitled Alison Lapper Pregnant, which was put on the fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square Mr Quinn said: ""I saw pictures of Jen on the plinth and she spontaneously made this gesture and I thought 'this is amazing'. ""She's made an extraordinary artwork just by doing that and it needs to be crystallised into an object and put back on to the plinth. ""It had to be in that public realm and I wanted to put it in that charged spot where Edward Colston had been before."" The statue of Edward Colston was pulled from its plinth last month and dragged into the harbourside On 7 June, protesters used ropes to pull down the Colston statue, which had been at the Bristol city centre site since 1895. It was then dragged to the harbourside where it was thrown into the water at Pero's Bridge - named in honour of enslaved man Pero Jones who lived and died in the city.

"Dr Fauci: ""It's only reflecting negatively on them"" US infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci has described recent efforts by the Trump administration to discredit him as ""bizarre"" and ""nonsense"". ""Ultimately, it hurts the president to do that,"" Dr Fauci said in an interview with The Atlantic. ""It doesn't do anything but reflect poorly on them."" On Sunday, a White House official shared a list detailing past apparent erroneous comments by Dr Fauci. But on Wednesday Mr Trump insisted he had a ""good relationship"" with him. ""We're all in the same team including Dr Fauci,"" he said. ""We want to get rid of this mess that China sent us, so everybody's working on the same line and we're doing very well."" Living in Florida and Texas as virus cases surge Why we should all be wearing masks The White House statement attacking Dr Fauci criticised him for what it said was conflicting advice on face coverings and remarks on Covid-19's severity. Responding to the criticism,Dr Fauci told The Atlantic that targeting him was ""completely wrong"",external. ""I cannot figure out in my wildest dreams why they would want to do that,"" he said. ""I think they realise now that that was not a prudent thing to do, because it's only reflecting negatively on them,"" he added. Anthony Fauci isn't angry. He's just... disappointed. The top government expert on infectious diseases took the high road in his first public comments after White House officials, both on and off the record, questioned his professional judgement and handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Dr Fauci acknowledges that the advice and analysis he has provided has shifted over time, but he insists his recommendations have always been based on the latest science. Those views have sometimes led to clashes with the president, who has attempted to shift focus to rebuilding a US economy that has been devastated by the pandemic. Dr Fauci has said that the top priority must be controlling the spread of the virus and recent reopening steps have set those efforts back. Such blunt talk has helped make Dr Fauci a popular figure during the pandemic, and that alone may be behind some of the resentment that is simmering within the White House. The swipes at Dr Fauci, however, seem destined to be counter-productive. With a general election just a few months away the Trump campaign needs a consistent public message - and an administration attacking one of its own, then distancing itself from those attacks, may only promote a message of chaos and confusion. Dr Fauci was also criticised by Peter Navarro, Mr Trump's top trade adviser,in an opinion piece for USA Today,externalin which he said the disease expert had been ""wrong about everything I have interacted with him on"". However, the White Housedistanced itself from Mr Navarro's remarks,external, with communications chief Alyssa Farah tweeting that the article ""didn't go through normal White House clearance processes"" and was ""the opinion of Peter alone"". Asked about Mr Navarro's piece as he departed the White House for Atlanta, Mr Trump said he should not have written it. ""Well he made a statement representing himself. He shouldn't be doing that,"" he said. In his interview with The Atlantic, Dr Fauci said he was not thinking of resigning over the attacks on him. ""I think the problem is too important for me to get into those kinds of thoughts and discussions. I just want to do my job. I'm really good at it. I think I can contribute. And I'm going to keep doing it,"" he said. He has also told Reuters that he believes the US will successfully develop a vaccine against the coronavirus by the end of the year. It follows early stage results from a vaccine developed by the firm Moderna, which Dr Fauci said were promising because the vaccine appeared to offer the type of protection seen in a natural infection. Dr Fauci's comments come after reports that as of 15 July, US hospitals will have to report Covid-19 patient data to the federal health agency in Washington instead of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). The CDC, the US's top public health institute, has until now been responsible for handling data about the pandemic from its hospital network. Health experts have expressed concerns that data will be politicised, become less transparent and possibly affect the work of researchers and modellers. The US has reported more than 3.4 million cases of coronavirus, and more than 136,000 deaths nationwide, according to Johns Hopkins University.

"So much for a summer lull in the coronavirus pandemic. Instead, the US has seen a resurgence of the disease in numerous states, particularly across the south and west. The US nation as a whole has topped 60,000 recorded daily new cases this week. Did it have to be this way, though? Other industrialised nations, in Europe and Asia, pursued more rigorous mitigation plans, ramped up testing and contact tracing earlier, and eased restrictions in a slower and more co-ordinated fashion. They have not, at least so far, seen a resurgence of the virus similar to the one the US is currently experiencing. The US state of Arizona, for instance, is currently registering as many new cases of coronavirus as the entire European Union, which has a population 60 times greater. It makes for a gloomy review of what's gone right and (mostly) wrong, as the US enters its fifth full month of a pandemic that has no end in sight. A month ago, the coronavirus numbers in the US appeared, at the very least, stable. The spread of the disease had been slowed, as the daily tally of new cases plateaued. That prompted a number of states - including Texas, California, Florida and Arizona - to move forward with plans to ease off public shelter-in-place and business closure orders. Many of these states moved ahead despite not hitting the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended benchmarks for doing so, such as a 14-day drop in cases and less than 5% of tests coming back positive for the virus. It turns out, the overall national numbers were misleading, as states that were hit hard early, such as New York and New Jersey, were experiencing declines, while numbers in other states were beginning to inch up. They're not inching up anymore, they're surging - and the worst, as far as hospitalisations and fatalities, could be yet to come. Now Texas, California and Arizona, among others, have re-imposed business closure orders and mandated mask-wearing, which has been determined to reduce the spread of the virus. It may be too little to avoid another public-health crisis, however. ""We opened way too early in Arizona,"" Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego, a Democrat, said in recent television interview. ""We were one of the last states to go to stay-at-home and one of the first to re-emerge."" What's behind alarming new US outbreaks? Living in Florida and Texas as virus cases surge The 8,181 Covid-19 hospitalisations in Texas on Sunday were yet another record high. In Arizona, 14% of coronavirus tests are positive for the virus. California, an early success story in limiting the spread of the virus, has seen a 90% increase in cases over the past two weeks, after the state in May allowed local authorities more discretion in businesses re-openings. This video can not be played Why coronavirus cases are surging in Texas The surge in cases is also again leading to delays and shortages in testing - an area that had appeared to be a strength for the US after a halting start. Without adequate testing, it will be significantly more difficult to identify and isolate new cases and locations where the virus is spreading unchecked. ""We're right back where we were at the peak of the epidemic during the New York outbreak,"" former Food and Drug Administration commissioner Scott Gottlieb said during a television interview on Sunday. At least for the moment, the rate of daily deaths has not reached New York levels - but that may only be a matter of time, as the current cases progress. ""It is already too late,"" says Luiza Petre, a New York City physician and professor of cardiology at the Mt Sinai School of Medicine. ""We're at a point of no return where it will be very, very difficult to restrain this pandemic."" Compounding the decision by some states to prioritise reopening in spite of warnings from public-health officials, one of the best methods of limiting the spread of the virus - wearing a face covering - has become mired in partisan acrimony. A June survey byPew Research Center,externalfound that only 49% of conservative Republicans said they wore a mask most of the time in the past month, while that number is 83% among liberal Democrats. Conservative opposition becomes even more entrenched at the prospect of government-enforced mask mandates. ""Kansans don't need Laura Kelly and the nanny state making decisions best left to individuals,"" Bill Clifford, a Republican congressional candidate in Kansas, said in response to a mask order from his state's Democratic governor. ""State mask mandates violate the principles of individual liberty and local control upon which America was founded."" Donald Trump himself has contributed to the division, mocking a reporter who refused to remove his mask during a press conference as being ""politically correct"" and retweeting a Fox News journalist who suggested a photo of Joe Biden in a mask was damaging to the Democrat's image. Few Trump supporters wore masks at his Tulsa rally The president has steadfastly refused to wear a mask in public events - a position that has clearly registered with his supporters. At the president's campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in June, few in the crowd chose to use face-coverings, and most disregarded social-distancing suggestions. Public-health officials aren't free from blame, either. Early on, they declared that face-coverings were only helpful for front-line medical personnel. While the real motivation for such statements may have been to reserve limited supplies to those most in need, the end result was a message that was muddled and shifted as the pandemic progressed. While some state governments have eased restrictions on public gatherings and allowed businesses to re-open, they have frequently accompanied such moves with recommendations that individuals make decisions based on medical advice and common sense. Those recommendations have been, to put it mildly, not always heeded. Summer holidays led to mask-less crowds in reopened bars and restaurants, public parks and beaches. And while masks were a fairly common sight during the mass anti-discrimination protests that swept the nation in the past month, social-distancing practices were essentially non-existent. This video can not be played Can you become immune to coronavirus? The numbers behind this new coronavirus surge indicates that many of the newly infected are younger Americans, who have been among the quickest to return to in-personal socialising. Some political leaders, including the president, have essentially encouraged this, asserting that the young and healthy have little to fear from the virus. ""Now we have tested over 40 million people,"" Trump tweeted on Saturday. ""But by so doing, we show cases, 99% of which are totally harmless."" That flies in the face of public-health studies that have shown that a fifth of Covid-19 cases result in severe respiratory distress. ""We have data in the White House task force,"" US Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephen Hahn on Sunday, refusing to reject Trump's 99% figure as false. ""Those data show us that this is a serious problem. People need to take it seriously."" But a president downplaying the severity of the disease can go a long way toward undermining words of warning from his subordinates. The coronavirus resurgence has also lit the fuse on a bomb that is set to explode in just a few months. September is when American children traditionally head back to classrooms across the nation, and it's becoming clear that nothing close to a normal educational experience is waiting for them. School administrators are starting to unveil their plans for the coming academic year, and in many cases it's a blend of in-person and distance learning with the hope that it's enough to keep their institutions from becoming staging grounds for spreading the pandemic. Already some teachers' unions are rebelling at the suggestion that educators - including elderly or those at greater health risk - return to classrooms with what they view as insufficient protection or preparation. ""Our educators are overwhelmingly not comfortable returning to schools,"" wrote the head of a Washington DC area teachers' union. ""They fear for their lives, the lives of students and the lives of their families."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? CONTACT TRACING:'He asked me: Am I going to die?â MEETING FRIENDS:How can I do that safely? GLOBAL TAKE:Which country has the most generous bailout? THE LOST SIX WEEKS:Missed chances for US to contain outbreak Meanwhile, parents facing the prospect of having to manage more de-facto home-schooling and figuring out how to care for and supervise their children while they, themselves, are being asked to return to their workplaces. Trump, despite campaigning in 2016 against federal involvement in local education systems, is already pressuring schools to open back up on time. He's called for the CDC to revise its guidance to make it easier to reopen school buildings and threatened to cut off federal funds for those that don't comply. Florida, a Republican-controlled state currently in the midst of a widespread coronavirus outbreak, already has ordered its schools to open for classes at the end of August. The president's rhetoric, delivered via Twitter, seems destined to politicise yet another aspect of the coronavirus response, again putting local officials in the unenvious position of balancing community health concerns with demands to return to normal times that seem increasingly out of reach. Although the coronavirus situation in many US states in the south and west has become increasingly dire, what was once the epicentre of the outbreak - New York - has made remarkable improvements. Daily deaths, which peaked on 8 April at 799, have dropped to single digits. Only 1.38% of the state's coronavirus testing last Friday returned positive results. As other areas have re-imposed lockdown restrictions, New York has begun reopening many public facilities and private business such as salons, tattoo shops and youth sport leagues. Indoor restaurants, however, remain closed. ""What happened in New York should have been a cautionary tale for the other states to pay attention and learn to create a more centralised strategy,"" says Ms Petre, the New York City cardiologist. ""New York is a success story."" As the state continues to ease its mitigation restrictions, there is the risk that the virus will return resurgent. ""We've been through hell and back, but this is not over,"" said New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. ""This can still rear its ugly head anywhere in this nation and in this state."" A funny thing happened on the way to the next Great Depression. The US economy, expected by many forecasters to be in a devastating tailspin, stabilised and began to improve. May unemployment figures, predicted to top 20%, registered at 13.3% instead. Then, in June, they ticked down to 11.4% - an indication that the workplace haemorrhaging had been stopped much earlier than expected. Meanwhile, key stock indices have bounced back from their late winter beating. By 2 July, the Dow Jones Industrial Index had recovered 66% of its losses from its February record high.  The Standards & Poor's 500 Index, a broader measure of stocks, has made up 77% of its losses this year. Things the US has got right - and got wrong (13 May) Things the US has got wrong - and got right (1 April) Other economic indicators offer similar signs of an economic resurgence. The strength of the recovery has largely been attributed to the push by states to quickly lift virus mitigation orders and federal action to provide economic support for businesses and individuals hit hardest by the virus. The return of business closures in several states could mean the economic good news will be short-lived. Meanwhile, most of the stimulus measures passed by Congress have either run their course or are set to expire soon, while there appears little prospect of further action. This video can not be played Living through the threat of eviction in the pandemic ""Since it is now clear that the effects of this crisis will be felt at least until the end of 2020, that relief package will not be enough,"" says Jill Gonzales, an analyst with the personal finance website Wallethub. While the coronavirus afflicts a growing number of US states, the American medical community continues to grind away at treatments and, ultimately, a vaccine. Remdesivir, an antiviral drug, has shown promise in limiting the severity of the disease in hospitalised patients (prompting the US government to strike a deal with the drug's manufacturer to prioritise American patients). A new study indicates that the commonly available steroid dexamethasone cut the risk of death for coronavirus patients on ventilators by a third. Life-saving coronavirus drug 'major breakthrough' There are also ""encouraging signs"" from experts that the use of blood plasma from recovered Covid-19 patients could help those currently suffering from the disease, although clinical research is ongoing. ""Medicine has evolved at lightning speed,"" says Ms Petre. ""The government has teamed up with pharmaceutical companies and a lot has been done, which is good"" On the vaccine front, there are now several pharmaceutical companies reporting positive results from early tests on drugs to boost immunity to the coronavirus. The president is promising a vaccine by the end of the year, if not earlier, although medical professionals caution that such a timeline is far from certain. Anthony Fauci, the chief US immunologist, would only say scientists are ""aspirationally hopeful"" that a vaccine would be ready by 2021. Given that a return to normal life in the US appears increasingly contingent on a safe and reliable vaccine, a lot is riding on these hopes.

"A Â£4bn cut in VAT has come into force, allowing firms in the food, drink and hospitality sectors to slash prices. Nando's, Pret A Manger and McDonald's are among firms to promise reductions after the chancellor ordered a temporary VAT cut from 20% to 5%. The Treasury estimates households could save Â£160 a year on average, but not all firms will pass on the benefit. Many companies are expected to use the windfall to shore up finances hit by the lockdown, rather than cut prices. The VAT reduction will stay until 12 January next year, Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced last week. It was part of a package of measures to help firms recover and get consumers spending. VAT - Value Added Tax - is paid on everyday goods and services, but the tax is usually included in the price most consumers see. Visitors may not see the thrill of VAT cut Summer Statement: Key points at a glance Several restaurants and food-to-go chains have announced price cuts: Nando's said it would pass on ""100% of the benefits"" from the tax cut to its customers, reducing the price of a quarter chicken by 55p Pret A Manger will cut the price of a takeaway latte by 35p to Â£2.40 from Wednesday, while the price of hot food will be cut from Friday KFC is reducing the price of sharing buckets by Â£1 and slashing the cost of certain ""fan favourites"" by 50p McDonald's is recommending that its franchisees cut prices on an array of products, including the Big Mac, Quarter Pounder and coffee Pub chain Wetherspoon is to reduce prices on meals, coffee and soft drinks, and reduce prices on popular beers Starbucks will pass on the full 15% discount on coffee served in company-operated stores. Other shops and venues with Starbucks licences will be left to pass on whatever reductions suit their business. Value Added Tax, or VAT, is the tax you have to pay when you buy goods or services. The standard rate of VAT in the UK is 20%, with about half the items households spend money on subject to this rate. There is a reduced rate of 5% which applies to some things such as children's car seats and home energy. When you see a price for something in a shop, any VAT will already have been added. There are also various items for which you do not have to pay any VAT, such as most supermarket food, children's clothing, newspapers and magazines. Read more about VAT It is clear that many businesses will not be passing on the reduction. Malcolm Bell, chief executive of Visit Cornwell, said the chancellor's move was to support business, not help holidaymakers. He said some firms had reported tourists calling them to ask for 15% off their holiday booking. ""My message to customers is this is to help the businesses, not to reduce the cost of their holiday. It is only a temporary relaxation up to January."" Many attractions such as museums, parks and zoos, might also not pass on the reduction. Bernard Donoghue, director of the Association of Leading Visitor Attractions (Alva), said he expected the VAT cut would go towards helping venues ""repair their finances as opposed to being passed on to customers"". Alva members were seeing a spike in demand after three months of lockdown, with attractions that offer pre-booked visits ""vastly oversubscribed"", he said. Pub chain Wetherspoon said it would use the tax break to help fund lower prices on some of its most popular beers. However, this move drew criticism from Tom Stainer, chief executive of the Campaign for Real Ale (Camra), and James Calder, chief executive of the Society for Independent Brewers (Siba). ""Like all pubs, Wetherspoon will not be able to benefit from a VAT reduction on beer sales and it is disappointing to see them potentially mislead customers into believing cheaper beer prices are as a direct result of the chancellor's measures,"" he said. Wetherspoon has produced promotional posters to advertise food price cuts, including one called Sunak's Specials and another called Dishi Rishi. Its chairman, Tim Martin, has campaigned for tax equality between pubs, restaurants and supermarkets for many years. He said: ""Supermarkets pay no VAT on food sales and pubs pay 20%. Supermarkets pay about 2p per pint of business rates and pubs pay about 20p. ""A VAT reduction will help pubs and restaurants reverse this trend - creating more jobs, helping high streets and eventually generating more tax income for the government."" But he said that not every hospitality business would be able to reduce prices immediately. ""Some will need to retain the benefit of lower VAT just to stay in business. Others may need to invest in upgrading their premises. ""However, lower VAT and tax equality will eventually lead to lower prices, more employment, busier High Streets and more taxes for the government."" What is VAT and how is it changing?

"Universities are worried by the financial cost if Chinese students don't turn up this autumn Many Chinese students are afraid to study in the UK because of fears over the high death toll from the Covid-19 pandemic, say researchers. UK universities have been worried about the financial cost of Chinese students cancelling courses in the autumn. But University of Manchester research suggests the barriers are not political tensions, fee levels or whether courses are taught online. Instead there is ""anxiety"" over whether it is safe to travel to the UK. Chinese students are the UK's biggest contingent of overseas students, worth around Â£4bn per year in tuition fees and other spending such as accommodation. UK universities fear major financial losses if the pandemic significantly cuts the numbers of Chinese students from the current 120,000 - with forecasts of cancellations ranging from 12% to 61%. Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute has warned against the ""over-reliance on Chinese students"". ""They were alarmed by the UK death toll, among the highest in the world,"" say the researchers from the University of Manchester. While headlines have been about political tensions over Huawei and Hong Kong, parents in China were more concerned about the safety of their children from coronavirus. UK universities comply with Chinese internet restrictions Hong Kong pupils banned from political activity Universities in UK see rising numbers of Chinese students The researchers spoke to companies and agents in China that recruit students for UK universities about why families might be hesitating. ""Most parents repeatedly expressed that safety in the UK was their first consideration now,"" says the study. ""Social media in China reported that many people in the UK were not following social distancing guidance and did not wear face masks in public,"" says the research. Decisions by Chinese students about studying abroad are ""almost always made as a family,"" says researcher Miguel Antonio Lim. ""Parents are understandably concerned about their children's safety,"" says Dr Lim - and he says this is heightened even more by China's one-child policy, when many students will be only children. Other issues raised by Chinese students included: Worries about ""reports of racist attacks on Chinese international students"" If courses go online they will miss out on the wider cultural experience Concerns about access to English language proficiency tests ""For many it will be a once in lifetime opportunity to live and learn abroad - but they are torn by concerns over their safety and the quality of their learning experience,"" says Dr Lim. Henry Xia thought he would soon be travelling to the University of Manchester, but instead he is ""still in a dilemma, deciding whether to go or not"". Henry Xia is keen on British culture, but can't decide whether it is safe to travel He says studying in the UK ""totally appealed to me"", but like other Chinese students he is worried about whether it is safe during the pandemic. ""I'm not sure if I will go to Britain, or make a different application,"" says the student from Shenzhen. ""I still have to discuss with my family."" ""My plan has been ruined,"" he says, about his intention to take a degree in teaching English. Henry fears that a second wave of the virus could push courses online, which would mean missing out on face-to-face teaching and the experience of ""local culture"". From China, he is carefully monitoring how the virus is being tackled, and says pictures of Boris Johnson wearing a mask are seen as a positive signal about the UK taking the virus seriously. Henry lists the culture that makes him want to come to Britain: ""Sherlock Holmes, Harry Potter, JK Rowling, Shakespeare."" But his plans for the autumn still have no clear happy ending. Many students are still making up their minds - and there have been wide-ranging forecasts about how many will not turn up. This is a big worry for universities, as overseas students pay higher fees and 35% of all non-EU overseas students are from China. Chinese students are more than a third of all the non-EU overseas students in the UK The British Council, in a survey of students from East Asia in which Chinese students were the biggest number, said an ""optimistic"" scenario would be a 12% decline, costing UK universities Â£460m. But a more pessimistic outcome, from these responses from May, would see 61% of students cancelling, at a cost of Â£2.3bn. A study from London Economics suggested a 47% drop in new arrivals from China - which would mean 14,000 jobs lost to the UK economy, including 7,000 in universities. This financial risk, say the economists, would be greatest in places with a high concentration of overseas students - in cities such as Sheffield. ""We simply don't know how many international students will come here next autumn,"" says Vivienne Stern, director of Universities UK International. ""If there is a big downturn it would have a very serious impact on university finances,"" she says. But there are signs international students are becoming increasingly confident about coming to the UK, says Ms Stern. Nick Hillman of Hepi says the financial reliance on Chinese students means ""if they were to stop coming, then that would be worse than almost anything else for universities' bottom lines"". But the government has offered support to soften the blow for some universities. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy has promised ""research intensive"" universities loans and grants of up to 80% of the losses from a decline in international students.

"A boy is vaccinated against measles in Samoa last year - many such programmes this year have been disrupted by the pandemic The pandemic has led to a sharp fall in the number of children around the world being vaccinated, the UN says. The decline in immunisation against diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough over the first four months of the year is the first in nearly three decades. World Health Organization head Dr Tedros Ghebreyesus said vaccines were a hugely powerful public health tool. He said the suffering and death caused by children missing out on vaccines could dwarf that caused by the virus. Immunisation programmes in three-quarters of the more than 80 countries that responded to a UN survey have been disrupted, Unicef and the WHO said. They said the disruptions were linked to a lack of personal protective equipment for health workers, travel restrictions, low health worker staffing levels and a reluctance to leave home, all of which saw programmes curbed or shut down. By May this year at least 30 measles vaccinations campaigns had been cancelled or were at risk. Measles resurgence fear amid coronavirus Measles deaths 'staggering and tragic' What are vaccines and how do they work? Measles outbreaks were already rising before the pandemic struck, with 10 million people infected in 2018 and 140,000 deaths, most of whom were children, according to UN data. Unicef head Henriette Fore said the coronavirus had made routine vaccinations a ""daunting challenge"". ""We must prevent a further deterioration in vaccine coverage... before children's lives are threatened by other diseases, she said, adding: ""We cannot trade one health crisis for another."" By Richard Warry, assistant health editor, BBC News Disruption to the global immunisation programme is extremely bad news, particularly for the world's poorest countries. It is estimated that immunisations save up to 3m lives a year by protecting children against serious diseases. The Unicef programme is specifically targeted at children who would otherwise struggle to receive good quality health care, but although vaccines now protect more children than ever before, millions of children still go without protection, and it is estimated that more than 1.5m people die each year from diseases that vaccines could prevent. Experts believe that low immunisation rates among poor and marginalised children seriously compromise all the gains made in other areas of maternal and child health, so major disruption on the scale outlined in this new report will inevitably cost a lot of lives. Coronavirus has consumed huge amounts of healthcare resources worldwide as the international community has focused on efforts to combat the deadly impact of the virus. It has also made delivery of healthcare difficult, particularly in poorer countries where supply chains have been disrupted, facilities and protective equipment can be basic, and fear of being infected has put people off attending clinics. But diseases such as measles, diphtheria, and cholera are already on the rise, underlining the urgency of finding ways to tackle this problem. Progress on immunisation had already been stalling before the pandemic, the UN agencies said. In 2019 nearly 14m children - more than half of them in Africa - did not get life-saving vaccines against diseases such as measles and diphtheria. Two-thirds of them were in 10 countries: Angola, Brazil, DR Congo, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, and The Philippines. World's worst measles outbreak kills 6,000 Meanwhile, historically high rates of immunisation had fallen in Latin America and the Caribbean, the UN said, with immunisation coverage falling by at least 14 percentage points in Brazil, Bolivia, Haiti and Venezuela over the past decade. ""The likelihood that a child born today will be fully vaccinated with all the globally recommended vaccines by the time she reaches the age of five is less than 20 percent,"" Unicef and the WHO said.

"Jamie Brown (left), whose father, Tony, died of Covid-19 in March, wants an urgent public inquiry Relatives of 450 people who have died in the coronavirus pandemic are demanding an immediate public inquiry. The families want an urgent review of ""life and death"" steps needed to minimise the continuing effects of the virus and a guarantee that documents relating to the crisis will be kept. A full inquiry would take place later, says lawyer, Elkan Abrahamson, who is representing the families. The government has said its current focus is on dealing with the pandemic. But the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK group say immediate lessons need to be learned to prevent more deaths, and that waiting for ministers to launch an inquiry will cost lives. The call for an inquiry comes as a report from the National Audit Office -assessing the readiness of the NHS and social care in England for the pandemic,external-  has shown it is not known how many of the 25,000 people discharged from hospitals into care homes at the peak of the outbreak were infected with coronavirus. Self-isolating if traced is civic duty School in September 'part-time if 2m distancing' Health and Social Care Select Committee chairman Jeremy Hunt said it seemed ""extraordinary that no one appeared to consider"" the risk. The Department of Health says it took the ""right decisions at the right time"". Ministers have insisted throughout that their response to the pandemic has been based on scientific advice. But for Jamie Brown, whose father, Tony, died of Covid-19 in Colchester General Hospital on 29 March, two-and-a-half weeks after travelling into central London by train, the government's decision to lock down on 23 March came too late. Jamie, 28, who said his father made the journey once a week at most, believes his death was preventable. ""I can't help but believe that if we'd entered lockdown sooner he wouldn't have been exposed in the way he was,"" he said. Tony Brown, 65, became ill with a dry cough and a temperature on 17 March. He was bedridden but was adamant he would ""wait out"" the illness at home. He appeared to be getting better but on 28 March he developed chest pains. By the following morning his family were so concerned they called an ambulance, and soon after Tony reached hospital he had a cardiac arrest - caused by respiratory failure - and died. A post-mortem test confirmed Covid-19 was present. Jamie said government advice to ""stay at home"" meant his 65-year-old father did not seek medical help early enough. ""He was trying to wait it out and if you wait too long it turns out it kills you really quickly,"" he said. He added that a detailed public inquiry into the broader handling of the crisis in the UK must eventually take place, but right now he believes it is crucial that a limited inquiry starts as soon as possible. ""We need to learn the lessons immediately from what has gone wrong to get us to this point,"" he said. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? IMPACT:What the virus does to the body RECOVERY:How long does it take? LOCKDOWN:How can we lift restrictions? ENDGAME:How do we get out of this mess? The group of families, which has 450 members and is expected to grow further, is supported by the Liverpool-based law firm Broudie Jackson Canter that acted for the Hillsborough families. Their lawyer Mr Abrahamson has backed their call for an early phase to any inquiry, with full proceedings taking place once the pandemic is over. ""What we need to look at straightaway are the issues which are life-and-death decisions,"" he told the BBC. ""We expect there will be a second spike. We want to know what the government is going to do when that happens."" Mr Abrahamson said an early phase to a public inquiry would also help clarify government plans for fully reopening schools and easing the lockdown and lay out the science behind these decisions more clearly. The government has rejected calls for an early start to any public inquiry. A spokesperson said: ""At some point in the future there will be an opportunity for us to look back, to reflect and to learn some profound lessons. ""But at the moment, the most important thing to do is to focus on responding to the current situation."" The National Audit Office's report into the readiness of the NHS and social care in England for the pandemic said 25,000 people were discharged from hospitals into care homes between 17 March and 15 April. That was 10,000 fewer than the same period last year. ""It is not known how many had Covid-19 at the point of discharge,"" said the report. It said NHS England and NHS Improvement advice at the time was to urgently discharge from hospital ""all patients medically fit to leave"" in order to free up bed space for coronavirus patients. The advice was changed on 15 April but the NAO noted that, as of 17 May, one in three care homes had declared a coronavirus outbreak, with more than 1,000 homes dealing with positive cases during the peak of infections in April. It follows a separate report by care chiefs in England, who saidthere were ""tragic consequences""of moving patients from hospitals to care homes at the start of the pandemic. The Department of Health and Social Care said 60% of all care homes had avoided outbreaks entirely. Mr Hunt, a Conservative MP and former health secretary, said: ""It seems extraordinary that no-one appeared to consider the clinical risk to care homes despite widespread knowledge that the virus could be carried asymptomatically. ""Places like Germany and Hong Kong took measures to protect their care homes that we did not over a critical four-week period.""

"There are no plans to make face coverings mandatory for office workers in England, Matt Hancock has said. The health secretary told the BBC people working in offices would not need to cover up, despite anewspaper report suggesting,externalthey would. ""It is something we've looked at and rejected,"" he said, but added masks would be worn elsewhere by the public ""for the foreseeable future"". Face coverings in shops will become mandatory in England on 24 July. Those who fail to comply with the new rules on wearing face coverings in England's shops will face a fine of up to Â£100. Children under 11, those with certain disabilities, and people working in shops will be exempt. Scotland already requires shoppers to cover their faces while Wales and Northern Ireland are both weighing up similar policies. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Boris Johnsonhas committed for the first time to an ""independent inquiry""into the government's handling of the pandemic. It comes as the UK recorded a further 85 deaths of people who tested positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of deaths to 45,053. R number 'lower than thought' before lockdown end Why have attitudes to face masks changed? A user's guide to wearing your face mask to the shops Mr Hancock said face coverings helped prevent spread during short interactions with strangers, but that social distancing and hand washing were more effective for contact with people over long periods of time. There is a difference between visiting a shop for a few minutes and working alongside colleagues at a desk for several hours, he told BBC Breakfast. ""When you're in close proximity with somebody that you have to work closely to, if you're there for a long time with them, then a mask doesn't offer that protection."" No 10 has suggested face coverings are not required while buying takeaway food after cabinet ministers Liz Truss and Michael Gove were photographed on Tuesday ""The same logic applies for schools - we're not recommending masks for schools because if you're in a classroom with kids all day then a mask doesn't give you protection,"" he added. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer's spokesman said the party was not calling for the compulsory wearing of face coverings in offices ""at this stage"". Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions in the Commons on Wednesday, Mr Johnson declined to say he would implement the recommendations ofa government-commissioned reportinto a potential ""winter wave"" of coronavirus infections later this year. The PM instead said the government was busy ""getting on with implementing the preparations for a potential new spike"" and is ""engaged in record investments in the NHS"". Mr Johnson went on to hail the UK's coronavirus ""Test and Trace"" scheme as being ""as good as or better than"" any other system in the world, although Sir Keir cast doubt on its success in ensuring people self-isolate. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash It comes as a council in Blackburn, Lancashire, told residents they must wear face coverings while in all public settings as it worked to combat a ""rising tide"" of coronavirus cases. Prof Dominic Harrison, Blackburn with Darwen's director of public health, said he hoped the use of coverings,alongside other specific measures, would prevent a Leicester-style local lockdown in the area. Leicester became subject tothe UK's first local lockdownon 4 July following a spike in Covid-19 cases. There are limits on social gatherings and hotels, pubs and restaurants have not been allowed to reopen. Residents and visitors in York are also being told to""wear masks now"" ahead of them becoming mandatoryfor shoppers on 24 July. Health officials in the city said there was ""mounting evidence for the value of wearing face coverings"". Meanwhile, questions were raised about exactly where face coverings would need to be worn by shoppers in England after various cabinet ministers were seen with and without masks buying takeaway food. Photographs of Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove showed him without a face covering while at a Westminster branch of Pret on Tuesday, while Trade Secretary Liz Truss was seen in the same shop minutes later wearing a bright blue mask. Mr Hancock told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he was ""not frankly interested"" in the pictures, adding: ""Those photographs were taken before I announced the change in policy to the House of Commons yesterday afternoon."" Chancellor Rishi Sunak was pictured wearing a face mask when buying takeaway food at a central London sandwich shop on Wednesday afternoon Downing Street then suggested face coverings will not have to be worn when buying takeaway food in England, with official guidance due shortly. The PM's official spokesman said his understanding ""is that it wouldn't be mandatory if you went in, for example, to a sandwich shop in order to get a takeaway to wear a face covering"". In response to the comments,Mayor of London Sadiq Khan tweeted,external: ""This is frankly ridiculous. The virus doesn't know if you're in a takeaway or a supermarket. The government is risking the health of the public to cover the back of a cabinet minister."" Mr Hancock said the public needed to get used to wearing face coverings in shops and at NHS facilities ""for the foreseeable future"". ""People have got to play their part,"" he said. Mask-wearing has been compulsory on public transport in England and at NHS facilities across the UK since 15 June. Meanwhile, more than Â£5m has been donated to the UK's Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) in its first day of fundraising to help some of the world's most vulnerable through the pandemic. The DEC, which is made up of 14 of Britain's largest aid charities,will spend donations onproviding food, water and medical care to people in countries such as Syria, Yemen and South Sudan.

"A boy is vaccinated against measles in Samoa last year - many such programmes this year have been disrupted by the pandemic The pandemic has led to a sharp fall in the number of children around the world being vaccinated, the UN says. The decline in immunisation against diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough over the first four months of the year is the first in nearly three decades. World Health Organization head Dr Tedros Ghebreyesus said vaccines were a hugely powerful public health tool. He said the suffering and death caused by children missing out on vaccines could dwarf that caused by the virus. Immunisation programmes in three-quarters of the more than 80 countries that responded to a UN survey have been disrupted, Unicef and the WHO said. They said the disruptions were linked to a lack of personal protective equipment for health workers, travel restrictions, low health worker staffing levels and a reluctance to leave home, all of which saw programmes curbed or shut down. By May this year at least 30 measles vaccinations campaigns had been cancelled or were at risk. Measles resurgence fear amid coronavirus Measles deaths 'staggering and tragic' What are vaccines and how do they work? Measles outbreaks were already rising before the pandemic struck, with 10 million people infected in 2018 and 140,000 deaths, most of whom were children, according to UN data. Unicef head Henriette Fore said the coronavirus had made routine vaccinations a ""daunting challenge"". ""We must prevent a further deterioration in vaccine coverage... before children's lives are threatened by other diseases, she said, adding: ""We cannot trade one health crisis for another."" By Richard Warry, assistant health editor, BBC News Disruption to the global immunisation programme is extremely bad news, particularly for the world's poorest countries. It is estimated that immunisations save up to 3m lives a year by protecting children against serious diseases. The Unicef programme is specifically targeted at children who would otherwise struggle to receive good quality health care, but although vaccines now protect more children than ever before, millions of children still go without protection, and it is estimated that more than 1.5m people die each year from diseases that vaccines could prevent. Experts believe that low immunisation rates among poor and marginalised children seriously compromise all the gains made in other areas of maternal and child health, so major disruption on the scale outlined in this new report will inevitably cost a lot of lives. Coronavirus has consumed huge amounts of healthcare resources worldwide as the international community has focused on efforts to combat the deadly impact of the virus. It has also made delivery of healthcare difficult, particularly in poorer countries where supply chains have been disrupted, facilities and protective equipment can be basic, and fear of being infected has put people off attending clinics. But diseases such as measles, diphtheria, and cholera are already on the rise, underlining the urgency of finding ways to tackle this problem. Progress on immunisation had already been stalling before the pandemic, the UN agencies said. In 2019 nearly 14m children - more than half of them in Africa - did not get life-saving vaccines against diseases such as measles and diphtheria. Two-thirds of them were in 10 countries: Angola, Brazil, DR Congo, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, and The Philippines. World's worst measles outbreak kills 6,000 Meanwhile, historically high rates of immunisation had fallen in Latin America and the Caribbean, the UN said, with immunisation coverage falling by at least 14 percentage points in Brazil, Bolivia, Haiti and Venezuela over the past decade. ""The likelihood that a child born today will be fully vaccinated with all the globally recommended vaccines by the time she reaches the age of five is less than 20 percent,"" Unicef and the WHO said.

"Viola Davis says she feels like she ""betrayed myself and my people"" in 2011 film The Help. Set in 1960s Mississippi it was nominated for multiple Oscars but Viola says it was ""created in the filter and the cesspool of systemic racism"". The film was ""invested in the idea of what it means to be Black"" but catered ""to the white audience"". It has been one of Netflix's most-watched films since recent Black Lives Matter protests. Viola Davis starred in The Help along with Emma Stone, Octavia Spencer and Bryce Dallas Howard It's based on a 2009 book that has been accused of perpetuating a""white saviour"" narrative- when black characters are marginalised for the benefit of a white hero who ""saves"" them. Viola plays a maid who helps Emma Stone's journalist character expose racism in the community - and thisisn't the first timeshe's said she regrets the role. ""There's no one who's not entertained by The Help. But there's a part of me that feels like I betrayed myself, and my people, because I was in a movie that wasn't ready to [tell the whole truth],""Viola told Vanity Fair,external. The Emmy, Oscar and Tony Award-winning actress - the first black actor to win the ""Triple Crown of Acting"" - says she took the role because she was hoping it would make her ""pop"".

"A Â£4bn cut in VAT has come into force, allowing firms in the food, drink and hospitality sectors to slash prices. Nando's, Pret A Manger and McDonald's are among firms to promise reductions after the chancellor ordered a temporary VAT cut from 20% to 5%. The Treasury estimates households could save Â£160 a year on average, but not all firms will pass on the benefit. Many companies are expected to use the windfall to shore up finances hit by the lockdown, rather than cut prices. The VAT reduction will stay until 12 January next year, Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced last week. It was part of a package of measures to help firms recover and get consumers spending. VAT - Value Added Tax - is paid on everyday goods and services, but the tax is usually included in the price most consumers see. Visitors may not see the thrill of VAT cut Summer Statement: Key points at a glance Several restaurants and food-to-go chains have announced price cuts: Nando's said it would pass on ""100% of the benefits"" from the tax cut to its customers, reducing the price of a quarter chicken by 55p Pret A Manger will cut the price of a takeaway latte by 35p to Â£2.40 from Wednesday, while the price of hot food will be cut from Friday KFC is reducing the price of sharing buckets by Â£1 and slashing the cost of certain ""fan favourites"" by 50p McDonald's is recommending that its franchisees cut prices on an array of products, including the Big Mac, Quarter Pounder and coffee Pub chain Wetherspoon is to reduce prices on meals, coffee and soft drinks, and reduce prices on popular beers Starbucks will pass on the full 15% discount on coffee served in company-operated stores. Other shops and venues with Starbucks licences will be left to pass on whatever reductions suit their business. Value Added Tax, or VAT, is the tax you have to pay when you buy goods or services. The standard rate of VAT in the UK is 20%, with about half the items households spend money on subject to this rate. There is a reduced rate of 5% which applies to some things such as children's car seats and home energy. When you see a price for something in a shop, any VAT will already have been added. There are also various items for which you do not have to pay any VAT, such as most supermarket food, children's clothing, newspapers and magazines. Read more about VAT It is clear that many businesses will not be passing on the reduction. Malcolm Bell, chief executive of Visit Cornwell, said the chancellor's move was to support business, not help holidaymakers. He said some firms had reported tourists calling them to ask for 15% off their holiday booking. ""My message to customers is this is to help the businesses, not to reduce the cost of their holiday. It is only a temporary relaxation up to January."" Many attractions such as museums, parks and zoos, might also not pass on the reduction. Bernard Donoghue, director of the Association of Leading Visitor Attractions (Alva), said he expected the VAT cut would go towards helping venues ""repair their finances as opposed to being passed on to customers"". Alva members were seeing a spike in demand after three months of lockdown, with attractions that offer pre-booked visits ""vastly oversubscribed"", he said. Pub chain Wetherspoon said it would use the tax break to help fund lower prices on some of its most popular beers. However, this move drew criticism from Tom Stainer, chief executive of the Campaign for Real Ale (Camra), and James Calder, chief executive of the Society for Independent Brewers (Siba). ""Like all pubs, Wetherspoon will not be able to benefit from a VAT reduction on beer sales and it is disappointing to see them potentially mislead customers into believing cheaper beer prices are as a direct result of the chancellor's measures,"" he said. Wetherspoon has produced promotional posters to advertise food price cuts, including one called Sunak's Specials and another called Dishi Rishi. Its chairman, Tim Martin, has campaigned for tax equality between pubs, restaurants and supermarkets for many years. He said: ""Supermarkets pay no VAT on food sales and pubs pay 20%. Supermarkets pay about 2p per pint of business rates and pubs pay about 20p. ""A VAT reduction will help pubs and restaurants reverse this trend - creating more jobs, helping high streets and eventually generating more tax income for the government."" But he said that not every hospitality business would be able to reduce prices immediately. ""Some will need to retain the benefit of lower VAT just to stay in business. Others may need to invest in upgrading their premises. ""However, lower VAT and tax equality will eventually lead to lower prices, more employment, busier High Streets and more taxes for the government."" What is VAT and how is it changing?

The Tokyo 2020 Olympics in Japan had to be postponed because of Covid-19 American athletes due to compete in the Tokyo Olympics will be provided with additional mental health support after the games were postponed until next year, officials say. United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC) officials said Wednesday that three independent mental health officers would give support to athletes ahead of the competition scheduled for Japan 2021. ""As our world continues to evolve during the challenges of a global pandemic and Games postponement, we want to ensure our athletes have the resources they need to focus on their mental health,"" said Bahati VanPelt, the USOPC chief of athlete services. The International Olympic Committee earlier said it was ""fully committed"" to the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 and had ""multiple scenarios"" for them to take place safely.  An investigation into a coronavirus-hit farm in Herefordshire has now been widened to include others in England and Scotland. The total number of positive coronavirus cases linked to the outbreak at AS Green & Co in Mathon now stands at 93, Public Health England (PHE) said. In an update on Wednesday evening, PHE said 76 workers who travelled on to other farms in England came to the UK on the same flight as the Herefordshire farm workers. It added that these 76 people have already been offered testing and no further cases have been identified to date. A further 63 workers who travelled on to Scottish farms were on the same flight. PHE said it has notified public health authorities in Scotland so this groupcan be ""followed-up appropriately"". A group of workers who travelled to the UK by private coach, including some of those who went on to work at AS Green and Co, are also being followed up, it added. Another worker fled the farm, despite being told not to. PHE said the agency that employed the worker (who tested negative for the virus) is in contact with them and has been advised they are self-isolating.Three other workers who fled the farm earlier have been traced. Karen Wright, director of Public Health for Herefordshire, said as testing of workers at the farm continues, officials expect to see the number of cases rise over the coming days ""before social distancing and infection prevention measures start to take effect"". She added that workers have been asked to remain on site and self-isolate to ""reduce risk of spread within the workforce and into the wider community"", and food and essential supplies were being delivered to the farm during this time. She said she knows local residents are concerned, but added the risk to the general public ""remains low"" The group said the Turkish villagers seemed seemed happy to host them Travel plans have been disrupted, borders have been closed and venues of all kinds have been shut during the pandemic. This posed a perfect storm of problems for a group of young musicians, whose road trip across Asia was brought to a standstill earlier this year. The band, called Tango Maluco, found themselves hunkering down in the most unlikely place - Erenler, a remote village in Turkey's Black Sea region. One member of the four-piece group, Mirjam Ellenbrok, told the BBC they got stuck in the village after the borders suddenly closed along their route. The group has made the most of their time, however, learning from the locals how to cook village specialities and prepare yogurt from cow's milk, while gardening in the lush surroundings.

Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Official Chinese media say that an undisclosed number of customers and delivery personnel have been told to self-isolate in southeastern China after Covid-19 was detected on shrimp containers imported from Ecuador. According to the official CGTN broadcaster, Covid-19 was detected on imported samples in the city of Pingxiang in Jiangxi province. The local government says that âno abnormal situation has been found in the city so farâ to suggest a potential localised outbreak. This is the second time this week that samples of seafood products have tested positive from the South American country. On Monday, the official China Daily said that seafood from three Ecuadorian companies were being pulled from shelves after six samples from inside shipping containers and the outer packaging of shrimp tested positive at customs. Many local governments and online retailers quickly issued suspension orders on these products and said that they were carrying out tests. In recent weeks, Chinese consumers have been nervous about eating seafood, after chopping boards used for imported salmon tested positive at a wholesale market in Beijing. It is believed this led to 335 people being infected across the capital city, and led to Beijing implementing a strict lockdown and aggressive testing procedures. A UK bingo chain has announced the permanent closure of 26 of its halls, putting 573 jobs at risk. Buzz Bingo, which is based in Nottingham, said it had taken the decision due to an ""unsustainable operating environment for the foreseeable future"". Its remaining 91 halls will continue to trade when they reopen from 6 August. Chief executive Chris Matthews said a restructure would ensure those clubs were able to adapt to new coronavirus safety measures and lower customer numbers. Buzz Bingo had to close its sites on 21 March due to the UK government lockdown and furloughed the majority of its staff. The company, which employs about 3,400 people, said it would ""take time"" for footfall at sites to reach pre-virus levels due to social distancing measures and weaker customer confidence.

Sweden's coronavirus containment strategy has been widely criticised Large parts of Swedenâs population are still susceptible to the coronavirus, the countryâs health authorities have said, casting further doubt on the so-called herd immunity strategy. Herd immunity happens when a large proportion of a population develops immunity to a contagious disease, be it through community transmission or vaccination. Sweden has seen far more coronavirus cases than any of its Nordic neighbours, recording 76,492 infections and 5,572 deaths to date,a Johns Hopkins University tally says,external. Sweden did not pursue a full lockdown, instead relying on voluntary social distancing and limited restrictions, such as the banning of large gatherings. The countryâs top epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, has previously expressed hope that herd immunity may be a useful by-product of the strategy, though not its aim. But on Tuesday a senior Swedish health official, Karin Tegmark Wisell, said large parts of Swedenâs population âhavenât been infectedâ by the coronavirus, meaning they are still susceptible. Earlier this month,a study from Spain raised questions about the feasibility of herd immunityas a way of tackling the coronavirus pandemic. Sir Ed Davey is one of two contenders for the leadership of the Liberal Democrat party Acting Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey has said an independent inquiry into the handling of coronavirus in the UK âcanât come soon enough for bereaved families.â Sir Ed said he had called for the inquiry at Prime Ministerâs Questions on Wednesday âbecause thereâs been tens of thousands of deathsâ and the bereaved families âneed to have some answersâ. Earlier todayPrime Minister Boris Johnson committed to ""an independent inquiryinto what happened"" during the UK coronavirus pandemic sometime ""in the future"". Mr Davey said he had since written to the prime minister asking him to âconfirm that it should be an inquiry under the Inquiries Act 2005,â which the acting leader claims would give it âreal teethâ¦ to get to the bottom of the issue"". âWeâve got to get on with it,"" he told the BBC. There have been more than 290,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 45,000 people have died, government figures show. Both case numbers and the death toll has been falling steadily, but concern remains over possible localised spikes in infection. Take a look atthe latest data on confirmed cases in your area. As coronavirus cases continue to climb, particularly in southern US states like Texas and Florida, many school districts are considering a combination of online and in-person learning - though the White House has continued to push for complete reopenings. A newPolitico/Morning Consult poll,externalhas found that a majority of voters do not think schools and daycare should fully open, in-person, this autumn. The poll also found that 65% of voters disagree with President Trump's threat to cut funding for schools that refuse to reopen. Another poll fromNavigator Research,externalon Wednesday said the number of parents who oppose reopening schools has jumped from 31% at the start of June to 51% as of 15 July. On Tuesday,an Axios/Ipsos poll,externalalso reported most parents, including a slim majority of Republicans, say it is risky to reopen schools. Now, a post to make you hungry if you've skipped lunch and are still a while away from dinner. Nando's, Pret A Manger and McDonald's are among the UK food chains to promise reductions in their prices after the chancellor ordered a temporary VAT cut from 20% to 5%. As a reminder, VAT is the tax you pay on everyday goods and services and is usually included in the price most consumers see. Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced the Â£4bn cut in VAT - which will stay in place until 12 January 2021- to help firms recover in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic and get consumers spending. The Treasury estimates households could save Â£160 a year on average, but not all companies will pass on the benefit. Many firms are expected to use the windfall to shore up finances hit by the lockdown rather than cut prices for customers. You can read more here. Governor Kevin Stitt Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt has announced he has tested positive for Covid-19. He is the first governor to publicly announce a virus diagnosis so far, US media report. ""I feel fine, I felt a little bit achy yesterday,"" the Republican governor told reporters. He said is isolating from his family - who have tested negative - and working from home. Stitt attended President Trump's controversialrally in Tulsa, Oklahoma,on 20 June, which local health officials have said was likely to have contributed to the city's recent spike in Covid-19 cases. The governor also told reporters he does not plan to make masks mandatory across the state. ""I'm so proud of how we've handled it this far,"" he said of the state's response to the pandemic. Shortly after the announcement, the Oklahoma Department of Health reported 1,075 additional cases - a new single-day record for the state,according to KOCO News,external. Three people who left a coronavirus-hit farm in England's West Midlands have now been traced,a council has said. Vegetable producers A S Green and Co in Mathon, Herefordshire,went into lockdown after testsshowed 74 people had tested positive for Covid-19. Of the three workers who left against advice, one had tested positive. They are all now self-isolating. A joint statement released on Wednesday from Herefordshire Council and Public Health Midlands said: ""Three workers (one of whom tested positive) left the farm despite being asked to remain on site and isolate. ""All three of these individuals have been reached through the agency that secured their employment, and all have confirmed they are self-isolating."" About 200 workers are said to be in quarantine at the site's live-in accommodation. The farm employs a mix of seasonal workers from the UK and abroad. Starbucks and Walmart on Wednesday announced new mask requirements in all  US stores amid Covid-19 surges in a number of regions across the country. Starbucks says facial coverings will be required for patrons and staff in all its cafes as of 15 July. The coffee retailer says it will also limit the number of customers allowed inside to maintain social distancing. Retail giant Walmart will enact a similar policy in its more than 5,000 stores by 20 July, and noted many stores were in regions already under government mandates regarding facial coverings. The company also said employees would receive special training to assist customers. ""We know it may not be possible for everyone to wear a face covering,"" company officials said. ""Our associates will be trained on those exceptions to help reduce friction for the shopper and make the process as easy as possible for everyone."" UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak has defended his job retention bonus scheme after MPs questioned its value for money. The policy - which was announced last week - will see the government pay employers Â£1,000 for every furloughed worker they retain past January. MPs on the Commons Treasury Committee described the scheme as ""badly-timed and poorly-targeted"". But Sunak said he believed it would ""serve as a significant incentive"" to preserve jobs amid the pandemic. Labour's Angela Eagle cautioned that scheme risked spending taxpayers' money for no benefit. ""Surely you could have had less deadweight if you'd have focused support on different sectors, why didn't you do that?"" she asked. But Sunak insisted the scheme ""will and can make a difference"". Kai Wei says people in Beijing have adopted a ""keep calm and carry on"" attitude As countries far and wide cautiously emerge from lockdowns, some places are regrettably heading back into them. From Europe to Australia, Asia to the US, restrictions are being reimposed in areas where coronavirus infections are on the rise again. The Chinese capital, Beijing, was among those places. We spoke to Kai Wei, a 29-year-old resident of the city, who gave us her guide to surviving a second lockdown. Kai's advice was to keep a happiness balance sheet, trying every means to stay entertained and sane. ""Live as normally as possible. And always wear a mask when you can go out!""

So which other countries can you now visit and what do you need to do when you return? Passengers entering the UK from dozens of countries no longer have to quarantine for two weeks thanks to a relaxation of the government's travel quarantine rules on Friday. More than 50 countries - including many popular holiday spots - now pose ''a reduced risk'' from coronavirus, the government says. WalesandNorthern Irelandhave introduced quarantine exemptions for the same countries as England. Scotland is also allowing exemptions, although unlike the other nationsdoes not exempt travellers from Spain, because of concerns about their rate of coronavirus. You can read more here. Another 85 people have died in UK hospitals, care homes and the community after testing positive for coronavirus, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) says. It brings UK deaths to 45,053 under that measure, but the figures do not include all deaths involving Covid-19 across the UK, which are thought to have passed 55,500. The DHSC also said that in the 24-hours up to 09:00 BST on Wednesday, there had been a further 538 lab-confirmed UK cases. Overall, a total of 291,911 cases have been confirmed. Iran has recorded more than 260,000 coronavirus infections Iran has said 140 of its health workers have died with Covid-19 since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. ""We all owe them our lives and to honour them, we must observe health protocols,â said Sima Sadat Lari, an Iranian health ministry official. The country has seen a rapid surge in the number of coronavirus cases recently, after relaxing its lockdown restrictions in mid-April. So far, Iran has recorded 264,561 infections and 13,410 deaths since the start of the pandemic,according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University,external. Health officials have suggested the renewed surge in new infections could be attributed to more testing, and they have said people were ignoring social-distancing rules. On Wednesday Iranian President Hassan Rohani urged people to respect health regulations, in particular social distancing. ""We ask the people to avoid all gatherings and to adapt the way of life to the current situation,â President Hassan Rohani said at a cabinet meeting.

Mike Pompeo has taken a hardline against China during the pandemic The World Health Organizationâs (WHO) inquiry into the coronavirus pandemic will be a âcompletely white-washed investigationâ, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said, as he lashed out at China. Mr Pompeo accused China of failing to disclose information about the coronavirus when the first cases were detected in the city of Wuhan last year. That failure, Mr Pompeo said, had âkilled over 100,000 Americans and âcost the global economy trillions and trillions of dollarsâ. âAnd now it is allowing the World Health Organization to go in to conduct what I am confident will be a completely, a completely white-washed investigation,â Mr Pompeo said at a news conference on Wednesday. Mr Pompeo appears to be referring to an independent inquiry into the global response to the coronavirus pandemic, launched by the WHO earlier this month. Chaired by two former world leaders, the panel will be tasked with analysing responses to the pandemic by member states and the WHO itself. The panel will not, however, look into the origin of the coronavirus, as Mr Pompeo and other world leaders had demanded. Throughout the pandemic, the Trump administration has implicated the WHO in an alleged cover-up by the Chinese in the early stages of the pandemic.

"Mark Sutherland's appeal was unanimously rejected by Supreme Court judges A convicted paedophile has lost a Supreme Court challenge over using evidence in court gathered covertly by so-called paedophile hunters. Judges unanimously dismissed an appeal,externalwhich argued that evidence from vigilante groups breached a person's right to a private life. It was brought by Mark Sutherland, who was caught by Groom Resisters Scotland. Sutherland was subsequently convicted of attempting to communicate indecently with an older child. He was appealing his conviction on the grounds that the covert investigation - and the use of the resulting evidence by the authorities - breached his human right for his correspondence to be private. The UK's highest court ruled on Wednesday that the interests of children have priority over any interest a paedophile could have in being allowed to engage in criminal conduct. Lord Sales delivered the judgement via video link, stating that the panel of five justices found there was no interference with the accused's rights under Article 8. He said this was for two reasons - the first being that ""the activity in question should be capable of respect"", and that children also have rights. Lord Sales said the state had ""a special responsibility to protect children against sexual exploitation by adults"". ""This indicates that there is no protection under Article 8 for the communications by the accused in this case."" he said. ""The interests of children have priority over any interest a paedophile could have in being allowed to engage in the criminal conduct in issue here."". The state must ""deter offences against children"" and so prosecutors were entitled to use the evidence gathered by Groom Resisters Scotland to secure a conviction. Lord Sales delivered the unanimous judgement via video link Secondly, he said, Sutherland had ""no reasonable expectation of privacy"" in the circumstances. ""There was no prior relationship between the accused [Sutherland] and the decoy [from Groom Resisters Scotland] from which an expectation of privacy could be said to arise. ""In addition, the accused believed he was communicating with a 13-year-old child, and it was foreseeable that a child of that age might share any worrying communications with an adult"", Lord Sales said. He added that prosecutors had ""no additional positive obligation"" to protect Sutherland's interests in any way that would prevent the prosecutor making use of the evidence to prosecute the crimes. Sutherland went to meet someone he thought was a young boy at Partick Station Mark Sutherland brought the case after beingcaught by a group of ""paedophile hunters"" called Groom Resisters Scotland. In 2018, Sutherland, 37, matched up on Grindr with someone who, when he communicated with them, claimed to be a 13-year-old boy. Sutherland sent explicit pictures and made arrangements to meet the ""boy"". It was in fact 48-year-old Paul Devine. When Sutherland turned up at Partick Bus Station in Glasgow, he found two members of Mr Devine's group. The group confronted Sutherland at the arranged meeting, and waited with him until police arrived. They broadcast the encounter on social media and handed the evidence to the authorities. Sutherland was convicted in August 2018 of attempting to communicate indecently with an older child, and related offences, andjailed for two years. He had previously been jailed for sending explicit pictures to a 12-year-old boy. At a hearing in June, Sutherland's lawyersargued in court that his right to a private life had been breached. This right is enshrined in Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, and states that everyone has the right to respect for his or her private life and correspondence. His lawyer, Gordon Jackson QC, argued: ""The police are aware that there a number of hunter organisations operating in Scotland and the UK and evidence submitted from these organisations has led to a number of criminal investigations and convictions."" There is ""disquiet"" about the work of such groups, and police and prosecutors give them ""tacit encouragement"", Mr Jackson said. He argued that ""a huge number"" of cases were prosecuted on the basis of information from these organisations. According to HM Inspectorate of Constabulary in Scotland (HMICS), almost half of online grooming cases result from the activities of vigilante groups. The inspectorate said these groups are unregulated and untrained, and in itsreport in February 2020,externalsaid: ""A more robust proactive capability on the part of Police Scotland would reduce the opportunities for these groups to operate.""

"The Chinese government has said it is ""strongly opposed"" to the UK's ""groundless"" ban of Huawei's 5G kit. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying added Beijing would ""take measures to safeguard"" the ""legitimate interests"" of Chinese companies. The US, however, has welcomed the move and announced new restrictions against the firm. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the US wouldcurb travel access for some of Huawei's workers,external. ""The State Department will impose visa restrictions on certain employees of Chinese technology companies like Huawei that provide material support to regimes engaging in human rights violations and abuses globally,"" he told a news conference. Mr Pompeo also passed comment on the fact the UK had given mobile networks until 2027 to remove Huawei's 5G equipment, saying: ""Faster is always better."" Earlier, President Trump had seemingly taken personal credit for the UK's action. ""We convinced many countries, many countries - and I did this myself for the most part - not to use Huawei because we think it's an unsafe security risk,"" the US leader said. Mr Trump made the comments as he attempted to increase pressure on Beijing byannouncing an executive order ending preferential treatment for Hong Kongin response to a new security law brought in by China. Donald Trump labelled Huawei a ""big security risk"" Huawei has repeatedly said itwould not cause harm to any country. The UK's digital secretary announced on Tuesday the country's telecoms networks would not be allowed to buy new Huawei 5G kit from 31 December and all such equipment should bestripped out of mobile networks by 2027. In addition, it wants BT's Openreach and other broadband infrastructure providers to stop using Huawei's gear in the rollout of full-fibre broadband within the next couple of years. China's ambassador to the UK said the decision was ""not only disappointing, it's disheartening"". ""The way you treat Huawei will be followed very closely by other Chinese businesses,"" Liu Xiaoming added. But the foreign ministry arguably used even stronger language. ""The UK side has used groundless risks as an excuse to co-operate with the United States... violating the relevant commitments made by the UK,"" Ms Hua said. ""Any decisions and actions must come at a cost,"" she added, without being more specific. Mr Huiyao Wang - an adviser to the Chinese government - told BBC Radio 4's Today programme Beijing still hoped the 2027 ban might be reversed before it came into effect. But, as things stood, it could have an impact on other Chinese investment in Britain. ""It goes against the UK tradition as the open liberal leader in free trade,"" the founder of the Centre for China and Globalisation think tank said. ""This is going to probably have very negative implications."" The UK government said it had based its decision on the advice of security chiefs who had judged they could no longer mitigate the risks of using Huawei's equipment in light of new US sanctions. The sanctions are designed to prevent the company having its own chips manufactured, making it buy in supplies from elsewhere. And GCHQ's National Cyber Security Centre said this meant Huawei's equipmentwas likely to face more,external""security and reliability problems"" as a consequence. This video can not be played Huawei's UK director of communications Ed Brewster says the UK's decision is about trade. Robert Hannigan, the former director of GCHQ, told BBC News the sanctions had indeed made ""a critical difference"".

Huawei 5G kit must be removed by 2027 Huawei UK 5G ban 'should happen sooner' But he did not believe any Chinese retaliation would come in the form of a hack attack. ""No doubt China will want to express its displeasure,"" Mr Hannigan said. ""But there's no particular reason to think that will be in cyber-space. ""There will be a lot of a lot of sound and fury. ""It may not amount to that much in the end."" Robert Hannigan ran the UK's cyber-spy agency GCHQ between 2014 and 2017 The UK accounts for a only small fraction of Huawei's revenue,which grew 13% in the first half of the year,externaldespite earlier efforts by Washington to disrupt its business. However, its concern is Westminster's move will motivate other countries to take similar measures. Announcing the ban to the House of Commons on Tuesday, Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden said it had not been an easy decision but was the right one for UK telecoms networks, national security and the UK economy. What is 5G? Why is Huawei being banned from the UK's 5G network?

The UK last reviewed Huawei's role in its telecoms infrastructure in January, when it was decided to let the company remain a supplier but introduced a cap on its market share. But in May the US introduced new sanctions designed to disrupt Huawei's ability to get its own chips manufactured. The Trump administration claims that Huawei provides a gateway for China to spy on and potentially attack countries that use its equipment, suggestions the company strongly rejects.

"Jen Reid posed with her statue, which appeared on the empty plinth on Wednesday A figure of a Black Lives Matter protester has appeared on the plinth previously occupied by the statue of slave trader Edward Colston. A sculpture of protester Jen Reid was erected early on Wednesday in Bristol city centrewhere the Colston statue was pulled downlast month. Ms Reid had been photographed standing on the empty plinth after the Colston statue was toppled during the march. Mayor Marvin Rees said the statue did not have permission to be installed. In a tweet he said: ""Anything put on the plinth outside of the process we've put in place will have to be removed."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Artist Marc Quinn said the black resin statue, called A Surge of Power, was meant to be a temporary installation to continue the conversation about racism. He said he was inspired to create it after seeing an image of Ms Reid standing on the plinth with her fist raised during the Black Lives Matter protest on 7 June. Mr Quinn then contacted Ms Reid through social media and they worked together on the statue, which was erected shortly before 04:30 BST. How many statues of black people does the UK have? This image of Jen Reid standing on top of the plinth after the Colston statue was pulled down inspired the sculpture ""I think it's something the people of Bristol really appreciate seeing,"" said Ms Reid. ""My husband took the photo on the day of the protests and put it on his social media. He was contacted by Marc Quinn who then contacted myself. ""I was in his studio by the Friday after the protest with 201 cameras surrounding me, taking pictures of me from every conceivable angle. That went into a 3D print and a mould was made."" Ms Reid said the sculpture was important because it helped ""keep the journey towards racial justice and equality moving"". The new statue was unveiled and put on the plinth early on Wednesday She said she had felt an ""overwhelming impulse"" to climb on to the plinth during last month's protest. ""When I was stood there on the plinth, and raised my arm in a Black Power salute, it was totally spontaneous,"" she said. ""I didn't even think about it. It was like an electrical charge of power was running through me. ""This sculpture is about making a stand for my mother, for my daughter, for black people like me."" People in Bristol stopped to take photos of the new statue Mr Quinn said: ""I saw pictures of Jen on the plinth and she spontaneously made this gesture and I thought this is amazing. She's made an extraordinary artwork just by doing that and it needs to be crystalised into an object and put back on to the plinth. ""It had to be in that public realm and I wanted to put it in that charged spot where Edward Colston had been before."" The statue of Edward Colston was pulled from its plinth last month and dragged into the harbourside Mayor of Bristol Marvin Rees, who had previously called the statue of Colston""an affront"", said the new sculpture ""was not requested and permission was not given for it to be installed"". In a statement, he said: ""The future of the plinth and what is installed on it must be decided by the people of Bristol,"" he said. ""This will be critical to building a city that is home to those who are elated at the statue being pulled down, those who sympathise with its removal but are dismayed at how it happened and those who feel that in its removal, they've lost a piece of the Bristol they know and therefore themselves. ""We need change. In leading that change we have to find a pace that brings people with us. There is an African proverb that says if you want to go fast, go alone, if you want to go far, go together."" The council has established acommissionof historians and other experts to research the city's ""true history"". Artist Marc Quinn's previous works include a sculpture entitled Alison Lapper Pregnant, which was put on the fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square On 7 June, protesters used ropes to pull the Colston statue, which had been at the Bristol city centre site since 1895, from its plinth. It was then dragged to the harbourside, where it was thrown into the water at Pero's Bridge - named in honour of enslaved man Pero Jones who lived and died in the city. Bristol City Council later retrieved the statue, which will be displayed in a museum along with placards from the Black Lives Matter protest.

Set in 1960s Mississippi it was nominated for multiple Oscars but Viola says it was ""created in the filter and the cesspool of systemic racism"". The film was ""invested in the idea of what it means to be Black"" but catered ""to the white audience"". It has been one of Netflix's most-watched films since recent Black Lives Matter protests. Viola Davis starred in The Help along with Emma Stone, Octavia Spencer and Bryce Dallas Howard It's based on a 2009 book that has been accused of perpetuating a""white saviour"" narrative- when black characters are marginalised for the benefit of a white hero who ""saves"" them. Viola plays a maid who helps Emma Stone's journalist character expose racism in the community - and thisisn't the first timeshe's said she regrets the role. ""There's no one who's not entertained by The Help. But there's a part of me that feels like I betrayed myself, and my people, because I was in a movie that wasn't ready to [tell the whole truth],""Viola told Vanity Fair,external. The Emmy, Oscar and Tony Award-winning actress - the first black actor to win the ""Triple Crown of Acting"" - says she took the role because she was hoping it would make her ""pop"".

""I was that journeyman actor, trying to get in."" Viola praised the film's white writer-director, Tate Taylor, and the majority-female cast that included Emma Stone, Bryce Dallas Howard, Jessica Chastain and Octavia Spencer, whose performance won her an Oscar for best supporting actress. ""I cannot tell you the love I have for these women, and the love they have for me. ""But with any movie - are people ready for the truth?"" Viola now has a production company with her husband Julius Tennon and will portray Michelle Obama in one of its upcoming shows Bryce Dallas Howard recently shared her views on The Help too. ""I'm so grateful for the exquisite friendships that came from that film -- our bond is something I treasure deeply and will last a lifetime. ""This being said, The Help is a fictional story told through the perspective of a white character and was created by predominantly white storytellers. We can all go further,"" she wrote on Facebook, sharing a list of films that ""centre black lives"" instead. Viola Davis is now at the top of her profession - but her talent wasn't really recognised until the last decade. Speaking to Vanity Fair she compared her career - and those of other ""unknown, faceless"" black actresses who represent earlier versions of herself - to ""fabulous white actresses"" like Emma Stone, Reese Witherspoon and Kristen Stewart who've had ""a wonderful role for each stage of their lives, that brought them to the stage they are now.

"The world is ill-prepared for the global crash in children being born which is set to have a ""jaw-dropping"" impact on societies, say researchers. Falling fertility rates mean nearly every country could have shrinking populations by the end of the century. And 23 nations - including Spain and Japan - are expected to see their populations halve by 2100. Countries will also age dramatically, with as many people turning 80 as there are being born. The fertility rate - the average number of children a woman gives birth to - is falling. If the number falls below approximately 2.1, then the size of the population starts to fall. In 1950, women were having an average of 4.7 children in their lifetime. Researchers at the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation showed the global fertility rate nearly halved to 2.4 in 2017 - and their study,published in the Lancet,external, projects it will fall below 1.7 by 2100. As a result, the researchers expect the number of people on the planet to peak at 9.7 billion around 2064, before falling down to 8.8 billion by the end of the century. ""That's a pretty big thing; most of the world is transitioning into natural population decline,"" researcher Prof Christopher Murray told the BBC. ""I think it's incredibly hard to think this through and recognise how big a thing this is; it's extraordinary, we'll have to reorganise societies."" It has nothing to do with sperm counts or the usual things that come to mind when discussing fertility. Instead it is being driven by more women in education and work, as well as greater access to contraception, leading to women choosing to have fewer children. In many ways, falling fertility rates are a success story. Japan's population is projected to fall from a peak of 128 million in 2017 to less than 53 million by the end of the century. Italy is expected to see an equally dramatic population crash from 61 million to 28 million over the same timeframe. They are two of 23 countries - which also include Spain, Portugal, Thailand and South Korea - expected to see their population more than halve. ""That is jaw-dropping,"" Prof Christopher Murray told me. China, currently the most populous nation in the world, is expected to peak at 1.4 billion in four years' time before nearly halving to 732 million by 2100. India will take its place. The UK is predicted to peak at 75 million in 2063, and fall to 71 million by 2100. However, this will be a truly global issue, with 183 out of 195 countries having a fertility rate below the replacement level. You might think this is great for the environment. A smaller population would reduce carbon emissions as well as deforestation for farmland. ""That would be true except for the inverted age structure (more old people than young people) and all the uniformly negative consequences of an inverted age structure,"" says Prof Murray. The world faces a shift from young to old The study projects: The number of under-fives will fall from 681 million in 2017 to 401 million in 2100. The number of over 80-year-olds will soar from 141 million in 2017 to 866 million in 2100. Prof Murray adds: ""It will create enormous social change. It makes me worried because I have an eight-year-old daughter and I wonder what the world will be like."" Who pays tax in a massively aged world? Who pays for healthcare for the elderly? Who looks after the elderly? Will people still be able to retire from work? ""We need a soft landing,"" argues Prof Murray. Countries, including the UK, have used migration to boost their population and compensate for falling fertility rates. However, this stops being the answer once nearly every country's population is shrinking. ""We will go from the period where it's a choice to open borders, or not, to frank competition for migrants, as there won't be enough,"" argues Prof Murray. Some countries have tried policies such as enhanced maternity and paternity leave, free childcare, financial incentives and extra employment rights, but there is no clear answer. Sweden has dragged its fertility rate up from 1.7 to 1.9, but other countries that have put significant effort into tackling the ""baby bust"" have struggled. Singapore still has a fertility rate of around 1.3. Prof Murray says: ""I find people laugh it off; they can't imagine it could be true, they think women will just decide to have more kids. ""If you can't [find a solution] then eventually the species disappears, but that's a few centuries away."" How do countries fight falling birth rates? The researchers warn against undoing the progress on women's education and access to contraception. Prof Stein Emil Vollset said: ""Responding to population decline is likely to become an overriding policy concern in many nations, but must not compromise efforts to enhance women's reproductive health or progress on women's rights."" The population of sub-Saharan Africa is expected to treble in size to more than three billion people by 2100. And the study says Nigeria will become the world's second biggest country, with a population of 791 million. Prof Murray says: ""We will have many more people of African descent in many more countries as we go through this. ""Global recognition of the challenges around racism are going to be all the more critical if there are large numbers of people of African descent in many countries."" You might think the number should be 2.0 - two parents have two children, so the population stays the same size. But even with the best healthcare, not all children survive to adulthood. Also, babies are ever so slightly more likely to be male. It means the replacement figure is 2.1 in developed countries. Nations with higher childhood mortality also need a higher fertility rate. Prof Ibrahim Abubakar, University College London (UCL), said: ""If these predictions are even half accurate, migration will become a necessity for all nations and not an option. ""To be successful we need a fundamental rethink of global politics. ""The distribution of working-age populations will be crucial to whether humanity prospers or withers.""

"The Downie sisters have spoken out about the ""ingrained"" and ""completely normalised"" abuse within British Gymnastics British Gymnastics has stepped aside from a review into allegations of widespread mistreatment in the sport to ""remove any doubt"" over the ""integrity or independence"" of the process. UK Sport and Sport England will now co-commission the independent review aimed at ""bringing about positive change"". Several gymnasts have come forward detailing theirexperiences of mistreatmentin recent days, including Olympians Becky and Ellie Downie, who claimed abusive behaviour in gymnastics became""completely normalised"". British Gymnastics chief executive Jane Allen said the decision was made to ""retain the trust of the gymnastics community"", adding: ""In the past week, the complexities have increased. ""Our priority is to learn the lessons and ensure the welfare of all those within gymnastics."" The British Athletes Commission (BAC) said it welcomed the decision by British Gymnastics and will work with UK Sport and Sport England to ""ensure a truly independent review that can command the confidence of gymnasts and all others affected by the allegations"". A confidential helpline is also being set up for British gymnasts who say they have suffered bullying or abuse. The service, run jointly by the BAC and the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC), comes amid widespread allegations in the sport. The dedicated helpline will be ""a safe place for athletes to go to"", BAC board member Peter Crowther told BBC Sport. ""We will then get each of these athletes the respective support they need. We have already had inquiries. ""It was gut-wrenching to see these utterly disgraceful allegations be made public and concerning not just athletes, but young children. ""This is likely to be one of the more in-depth and broad-ranging situations we've faced, but unfortunately we've dealt with many situations of alleged abuseâ¦ across many sports."" Earlier, Crowther had said the BAC should also help decide the terms of reference for the panel that leads the inquiry. ""It is understandable that British Gymnastics wants to have an independent investigationâ¦ when something as serious as this emerges,"" he said. ""[But] frankly, it's not in the interest of anyone, including British Gymnastics, to commission a report where they set the terms of the investigation and tell the investigating panel what sort of questions to ask. ""It doesn't inspire confidence - athletes need to go somewhere they feel completely safe."" British Gymnastics has encouraged athletes with ""concerns around specific incidents or behaviours"" to contact its integrity unit. The BAC/NSPCC helpline will also now be available from 20 July. On Wednesday, Olympic medallist Beth Tweddle said ""there is no place for bullying or abuse in the sport that I love"", and urged all gymnasts to share their feelings. Meanwhile, International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach said the organisation takes the allegations of emotional and physical abuse in British gymnastics ""very, very seriously"". ""These cases are clearly against everything we stand for and therefore we will do everything we can with regard to prevention,"" he said. ""But also to then follow up on cases if they should come under our jurisdiction."" British Gymnastics is the latest governing body to be engulfed in an athlete welfare crisis since Rio 2016, and Crowther said the development shows ""more effort needs to be put into policing the high-performance system"". Crowther said the funding the BAC received from UK Sport was ""deeply insufficient"". In 2018, UK Sport announced a range of new initiatives to improve athlete welfare, upping investment for the BAC to Â£1m for the rest of the Tokyo 2020 cycle which it said would generate ""a three-fold increase in its capacity to support its members"". Dame Tanni Grey-Thompson, who led a duty of care review in 2017, called for her recommendations of a sports ombudsman and independent funding of the BAC to now be implemented. ""Ultimately, I don't think enough has been done,"" the cross-bench peer and 11-time Paralympic gold medallist told BBC Sport. ""With each new issue that arises and hits the media for a brief amount of time, it then disappears again and everyone just gets back to normal. ""We do need to look at a massive cultural change. I don't think applying duty of care to anyone in the system means less medals, it just means that we help people survive the system in the best way they can."" Meanwhile, Team GB chef de mission Mark England told BBC Sport's Nick Hope that the British Olympic Association (BOA) is ""alarmed"" by the allegations of widespread mistreatment. England, who led Team GB at Rio 2016 and will do so again at the Tokyo Olympics next year, insists the welfare support system in place for next summer's Games is already ""hugely sound"". He says the BOA will consider the findings of the independent review. ""British Gymnastics took a very important step to announce an independent review,"" England said.

The Tokyo 2020 Olympics in Japan had to be postponed because of Covid-19 American athletes due to compete in the Tokyo Olympics will be provided with additional mental health support after the games were postponed until next year, officials say. United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC) officials said Wednesday that three independent mental health officers would give support to athletes ahead of the competition scheduled for Japan 2021. ""As our world continues to evolve during the challenges of a global pandemic and Games postponement, we want to ensure our athletes have the resources they need to focus on their mental health,"" said Bahati VanPelt, the USOPC chief of athlete services. The International Olympic Committee earlier said it was ""fully committed"" to the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 and had ""multiple scenarios"" for them to take place safely.  An investigation into a coronavirus-hit farm in Herefordshire has now been widened to include others in England and Scotland. The total number of positive coronavirus cases linked to the outbreak at AS Green & Co in Mathon now stands at 93, Public Health England (PHE) said. In an update on Wednesday evening, PHE said 76 workers who travelled on to other farms in England came to the UK on the same flight as the Herefordshire farm workers. It added that these 76 people have already been offered testing and no further cases have been identified to date. A further 63 workers who travelled on to Scottish farms were on the same flight. PHE said it has notified public health authorities in Scotland so this groupcan be ""followed-up appropriately"". A group of workers who travelled to the UK by private coach, including some of those who went on to work at AS Green and Co, are also being followed up, it added. Another worker fled the farm, despite being told not to. PHE said the agency that employed the worker (who tested negative for the virus) is in contact with them and has been advised they are self-isolating.Three other workers who fled the farm earlier have been traced. Karen Wright, director of Public Health for Herefordshire, said as testing of workers at the farm continues, officials expect to see the number of cases rise over the coming days ""before social distancing and infection prevention measures start to take effect"". She added that workers have been asked to remain on site and self-isolate to ""reduce risk of spread within the workforce and into the wider community"", and food and essential supplies were being delivered to the farm during this time. She said she knows local residents are concerned, but added the risk to the general public ""remains low"" The group said the Turkish villagers seemed seemed happy to host them Travel plans have been disrupted, borders have been closed and venues of all kinds have been shut during the pandemic. This posed a perfect storm of problems for a group of young musicians, whose road trip across Asia was brought to a standstill earlier this year. The band, called Tango Maluco, found themselves hunkering down in the most unlikely place - Erenler, a remote village in Turkey's Black Sea region. One member of the four-piece group, Mirjam Ellenbrok, told the BBC they got stuck in the village after the borders suddenly closed along their route. The group has made the most of their time, however, learning from the locals how to cook village specialities and prepare yogurt from cow's milk, while gardening in the lush surroundings. Read the full storyto see how the group whiled away the time in the mountain village. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Official Chinese media say that an undisclosed number of customers and delivery personnel have been told to self-isolate in southeastern China after Covid-19 was detected on shrimp containers imported from Ecuador. According to the official CGTN broadcaster, Covid-19 was detected on imported samples in the city of Pingxiang in Jiangxi province. The local government says that âno abnormal situation has been found in the city so farâ to suggest a potential localised outbreak. This is the second time this week that samples of seafood products have tested positive from the South American country. On Monday, the official China Daily said that seafood from three Ecuadorian companies were being pulled from shelves after six samples from inside shipping containers and the outer packaging of shrimp tested positive at customs. Many local governments and online retailers quickly issued suspension orders on these products and said that they were carrying out tests. In recent weeks, Chinese consumers have been nervous about eating seafood, after chopping boards used for imported salmon tested positive at a wholesale market in Beijing. It is believed this led to 335 people being infected across the capital city, and led to Beijing implementing a strict lockdown and aggressive testing procedures. A UK bingo chain has announced the permanent closure of 26 of its halls, putting 573 jobs at risk. Buzz Bingo, which is based in Nottingham, said it had taken the decision due to an ""unsustainable operating environment for the foreseeable future"". Its remaining 91 halls will continue to trade when they reopen from 6 August. Chief executive Chris Matthews said a restructure would ensure those clubs were able to adapt to new coronavirus safety measures and lower customer numbers. Buzz Bingo had to close its sites on 21 March due to the UK government lockdown and furloughed the majority of its staff. The company, which employs about 3,400 people, said it would ""take time"" for footfall at sites to reach pre-virus levels due to social distancing measures and weaker customer confidence.

Sweden's coronavirus containment strategy has been widely criticised Large parts of Swedenâs population are still susceptible to the coronavirus, the countryâs health authorities have said, casting further doubt on the so-called herd immunity strategy. Herd immunity happens when a large proportion of a population develops immunity to a contagious disease, be it through community transmission or vaccination. Sweden has seen far more coronavirus cases than any of its Nordic neighbours, recording 76,492 infections and 5,572 deaths to date,a Johns Hopkins University tally says,external. Sweden did not pursue a full lockdown, instead relying on voluntary social distancing and limited restrictions, such as the banning of large gatherings. The countryâs top epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, has previously expressed hope that herd immunity may be a useful by-product of the strategy, though not its aim. But on Tuesday a senior Swedish health official, Karin Tegmark Wisell, said large parts of Swedenâs population âhavenât been infectedâ by the coronavirus, meaning they are still susceptible. Earlier this month,a study from Spain raised questions about the feasibility of herd immunityas a way of tackling the coronavirus pandemic. Sir Ed Davey is one of two contenders for the leadership of the Liberal Democrat party Acting Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey has said an independent inquiry into the handling of coronavirus in the UK âcanât come soon enough for bereaved families.â Sir Ed said he had called for the inquiry at Prime Ministerâs Questions on Wednesday âbecause thereâs been tens of thousands of deathsâ and the bereaved families âneed to have some answersâ. Earlier todayPrime Minister Boris Johnson committed to ""an independent inquiryinto what happened"" during the UK coronavirus pandemic sometime ""in the future"". Mr Davey said he had since written to the prime minister asking him to âconfirm that it should be an inquiry under the Inquiries Act 2005,â which the acting leader claims would give it âreal teethâ¦ to get to the bottom of the issue"". âWeâve got to get on with it,"" he told the BBC. There have been more than 290,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 45,000 people have died, government figures show. Both case numbers and the death toll has been falling steadily, but concern remains over possible localised spikes in infection. Take a look atthe latest data on confirmed cases in your area. As coronavirus cases continue to climb, particularly in southern US states like Texas and Florida, many school districts are considering a combination of online and in-person learning - though the White House has continued to push for complete reopenings. A newPolitico/Morning Consult poll,externalhas found that a majority of voters do not think schools and daycare should fully open, in-person, this autumn. The poll also found that 65% of voters disagree with President Trump's threat to cut funding for schools that refuse to reopen. Another poll fromNavigator Research,externalon Wednesday said the number of parents who oppose reopening schools has jumped from 31% at the start of June to 51% as of 15 July. On Tuesday,an Axios/Ipsos poll,externalalso reported most parents, including a slim majority of Republicans, say it is risky to reopen schools. Now, a post to make you hungry if you've skipped lunch and are still a while away from dinner. Nando's, Pret A Manger and McDonald's are among the UK food chains to promise reductions in their prices after the chancellor ordered a temporary VAT cut from 20% to 5%. As a reminder, VAT is the tax you pay on everyday goods and services and is usually included in the price most consumers see. Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced the Â£4bn cut in VAT - which will stay in place until 12 January 2021- to help firms recover in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic and get consumers spending. The Treasury estimates households could save Â£160 a year on average, but not all companies will pass on the benefit. Many firms are expected to use the windfall to shore up finances hit by the lockdown rather than cut prices for customers. You can read more here. Governor Kevin Stitt Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt has announced he has tested positive for Covid-19. He is the first governor to publicly announce a virus diagnosis so far, US media report. ""I feel fine, I felt a little bit achy yesterday,"" the Republican governor told reporters. He said is isolating from his family - who have tested negative - and working from home. Stitt attended President Trump's controversialrally in Tulsa, Oklahoma,on 20 June, which local health officials have said was likely to have contributed to the city's recent spike in Covid-19 cases. The governor also told reporters he does not plan to make masks mandatory across the state. ""I'm so proud of how we've handled it this far,"" he said of the state's response to the pandemic. Shortly after the announcement, the Oklahoma Department of Health reported 1,075 additional cases - a new single-day record for the state,according to KOCO News,external. Three people who left a coronavirus-hit farm in England's West Midlands have now been traced,a council has said. Vegetable producers A S Green and Co in Mathon, Herefordshire,went into lockdown after testsshowed 74 people had tested positive for Covid-19. Of the three workers who left against advice, one had tested positive. They are all now self-isolating. A joint statement released on Wednesday from Herefordshire Council and Public Health Midlands said: ""Three workers (one of whom tested positive) left the farm despite being asked to remain on site and isolate. ""All three of these individuals have been reached through the agency that secured their employment, and all have confirmed they are self-isolating."" About 200 workers are said to be in quarantine at the site's live-in accommodation. The farm employs a mix of seasonal workers from the UK and abroad. Starbucks and Walmart on Wednesday announced new mask requirements in all  US stores amid Covid-19 surges in a number of regions across the country. Starbucks says facial coverings will be required for patrons and staff in all its cafes as of 15 July. The coffee retailer says it will also limit the number of customers allowed inside to maintain social distancing. Retail giant Walmart will enact a similar policy in its more than 5,000 stores by 20 July, and noted many stores were in regions already under government mandates regarding facial coverings. The company also said employees would receive special training to assist customers. ""We know it may not be possible for everyone to wear a face covering,"" company officials said. ""Our associates will be trained on those exceptions to help reduce friction for the shopper and make the process as easy as possible for everyone."" UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak has defended his job retention bonus scheme after MPs questioned its value for money. The policy - which was announced last week - will see the government pay employers Â£1,000 for every furloughed worker they retain past January. MPs on the Commons Treasury Committee described the scheme as ""badly-timed and poorly-targeted"". But Sunak said he believed it would ""serve as a significant incentive"" to preserve jobs amid the pandemic. Labour's Angela Eagle cautioned that scheme risked spending taxpayers' money for no benefit. ""Surely you could have had less deadweight if you'd have focused support on different sectors, why didn't you do that?"" she asked. But Sunak insisted the scheme ""will and can make a difference"". Kai Wei says people in Beijing have adopted a ""keep calm and carry on"" attitude As countries far and wide cautiously emerge from lockdowns, some places are regrettably heading back into them. From Europe to Australia, Asia to the US, restrictions are being reimposed in areas where coronavirus infections are on the rise again. The Chinese capital, Beijing, was among those places. We spoke to Kai Wei, a 29-year-old resident of the city, who gave us her guide to surviving a second lockdown. Kai's advice was to keep a happiness balance sheet, trying every means to stay entertained and sane. ""Live as normally as possible. And always wear a mask when you can go out!"" Read our pieceto see what other people living under second lockdowns have advised. From today, holidaymakers can take direct flights to Greece from the UK. So which other countries can you now visit and what do you need to do when you return? Passengers entering the UK from dozens of countries no longer have to quarantine for two weeks thanks to a relaxation of the government's travel quarantine rules on Friday. More than 50 countries - including many popular holiday spots - now pose ''a reduced risk'' from coronavirus, the government says.

Another 85 people have died in UK hospitals, care homes and the community after testing positive for coronavirus, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) says. It brings UK deaths to 45,053 under that measure, but the figures do not include all deaths involving Covid-19 across the UK, which are thought to have passed 55,500. The DHSC also said that in the 24-hours up to 09:00 BST on Wednesday, there had been a further 538 lab-confirmed UK cases. Overall, a total of 291,911 cases have been confirmed. Iran has recorded more than 260,000 coronavirus infections Iran has said 140 of its health workers have died with Covid-19 since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. ""We all owe them our lives and to honour them, we must observe health protocols,â said Sima Sadat Lari, an Iranian health ministry official. The country has seen a rapid surge in the number of coronavirus cases recently, after relaxing its lockdown restrictions in mid-April. So far, Iran has recorded 264,561 infections and 13,410 deaths since the start of the pandemic,according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University,external. Health officials have suggested the renewed surge in new infections could be attributed to more testing, and they have said people were ignoring social-distancing rules. On Wednesday Iranian President Hassan Rohani urged people to respect health regulations, in particular social distancing. ""We ask the people to avoid all gatherings and to adapt the way of life to the current situation,â President Hassan Rohani said at a cabinet meeting.

Mike Pompeo has taken a hardline against China during the pandemic The World Health Organizationâs (WHO) inquiry into the coronavirus pandemic will be a âcompletely white-washed investigationâ, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said, as he lashed out at China. Mr Pompeo accused China of failing to disclose information about the coronavirus when the first cases were detected in the city of Wuhan last year. That failure, Mr Pompeo said, had âkilled over 100,000 Americans and âcost the global economy trillions and trillions of dollarsâ. âAnd now it is allowing the World Health Organization to go in to conduct what I am confident will be a completely, a completely white-washed investigation,â Mr Pompeo said at a news conference on Wednesday. Mr Pompeo appears to be referring to an independent inquiry into the global response to the coronavirus pandemic, launched by the WHO earlier this month. Chaired by two former world leaders, the panel will be tasked with analysing responses to the pandemic by member states and the WHO itself. The panel will not, however, look into the origin of the coronavirus, as Mr Pompeo and other world leaders had demanded. Throughout the pandemic, the Trump administration has implicated the WHO in an alleged cover-up by the Chinese in the early stages of the pandemic.

The Tokyo 2020 Olympics in Japan had to be postponed because of Covid-19 American athletes due to compete in the Tokyo Olympics will be provided with additional mental health support after the games were postponed until next year, officials say. United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC) officials said Wednesday that three independent mental health officers would give support to athletes ahead of the competition scheduled for Japan 2021. ""As our world continues to evolve during the challenges of a global pandemic and Games postponement, we want to ensure our athletes have the resources they need to focus on their mental health,"" said Bahati VanPelt, the USOPC chief of athlete services. The International Olympic Committee earlier said it was ""fully committed"" to the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 and had ""multiple scenarios"" for them to take place safely.  An investigation into a coronavirus-hit farm in Herefordshire has now been widened to include others in England and Scotland. The total number of positive coronavirus cases linked to the outbreak at AS Green & Co in Mathon now stands at 93, Public Health England (PHE) said. In an update on Wednesday evening, PHE said 76 workers who travelled on to other farms in England came to the UK on the same flight as the Herefordshire farm workers. It added that these 76 people have already been offered testing and no further cases have been identified to date. A further 63 workers who travelled on to Scottish farms were on the same flight. PHE said it has notified public health authorities in Scotland so this groupcan be ""followed-up appropriately"". A group of workers who travelled to the UK by private coach, including some of those who went on to work at AS Green and Co, are also being followed up, it added. Another worker fled the farm, despite being told not to. PHE said the agency that employed the worker (who tested negative for the virus) is in contact with them and has been advised they are self-isolating.Three other workers who fled the farm earlier have been traced. Karen Wright, director of Public Health for Herefordshire, said as testing of workers at the farm continues, officials expect to see the number of cases rise over the coming days ""before social distancing and infection prevention measures start to take effect"". She added that workers have been asked to remain on site and self-isolate to ""reduce risk of spread within the workforce and into the wider community"", and food and essential supplies were being delivered to the farm during this time. She said she knows local residents are concerned, but added the risk to the general public ""remains low"" The group said the Turkish villagers seemed seemed happy to host them Travel plans have been disrupted, borders have been closed and venues of all kinds have been shut during the pandemic. This posed a perfect storm of problems for a group of young musicians, whose road trip across Asia was brought to a standstill earlier this year. The band, called Tango Maluco, found themselves hunkering down in the most unlikely place - Erenler, a remote village in Turkey's Black Sea region. One member of the four-piece group, Mirjam Ellenbrok, told the BBC they got stuck in the village after the borders suddenly closed along their route. The group has made the most of their time, however, learning from the locals how to cook village specialities and prepare yogurt from cow's milk, while gardening in the lush surroundings.

Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Official Chinese media say that an undisclosed number of customers and delivery personnel have been told to self-isolate in southeastern China after Covid-19 was detected on shrimp containers imported from Ecuador. According to the official CGTN broadcaster, Covid-19 was detected on imported samples in the city of Pingxiang in Jiangxi province. The local government says that âno abnormal situation has been found in the city so farâ to suggest a potential localised outbreak. This is the second time this week that samples of seafood products have tested positive from the South American country. On Monday, the official China Daily said that seafood from three Ecuadorian companies were being pulled from shelves after six samples from inside shipping containers and the outer packaging of shrimp tested positive at customs. Many local governments and online retailers quickly issued suspension orders on these products and said that they were carrying out tests. In recent weeks, Chinese consumers have been nervous about eating seafood, after chopping boards used for imported salmon tested positive at a wholesale market in Beijing. It is believed this led to 335 people being infected across the capital city, and led to Beijing implementing a strict lockdown and aggressive testing procedures. A UK bingo chain has announced the permanent closure of 26 of its halls, putting 573 jobs at risk. Buzz Bingo, which is based in Nottingham, said it had taken the decision due to an ""unsustainable operating environment for the foreseeable future"". Its remaining 91 halls will continue to trade when they reopen from 6 August. Chief executive Chris Matthews said a restructure would ensure those clubs were able to adapt to new coronavirus safety measures and lower customer numbers. Buzz Bingo had to close its sites on 21 March due to the UK government lockdown and furloughed the majority of its staff. The company, which employs about 3,400 people, said it would ""take time"" for footfall at sites to reach pre-virus levels due to social distancing measures and weaker customer confidence.

Sweden's coronavirus containment strategy has been widely criticised Large parts of Swedenâs population are still susceptible to the coronavirus, the countryâs health authorities have said, casting further doubt on the so-called herd immunity strategy. Herd immunity happens when a large proportion of a population develops immunity to a contagious disease, be it through community transmission or vaccination. Sweden has seen far more coronavirus cases than any of its Nordic neighbours, recording 76,492 infections and 5,572 deaths to date,a Johns Hopkins University tally says,external. Sweden did not pursue a full lockdown, instead relying on voluntary social distancing and limited restrictions, such as the banning of large gatherings. The countryâs top epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, has previously expressed hope that herd immunity may be a useful by-product of the strategy, though not its aim. But on Tuesday a senior Swedish health official, Karin Tegmark Wisell, said large parts of Swedenâs population âhavenât been infectedâ by the coronavirus, meaning they are still susceptible. Earlier this month,a study from Spain raised questions about the feasibility of herd immunityas a way of tackling the coronavirus pandemic. Sir Ed Davey is one of two contenders for the leadership of the Liberal Democrat party Acting Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey has said an independent inquiry into the handling of coronavirus in the UK âcanât come soon enough for bereaved families.â Sir Ed said he had called for the inquiry at Prime Ministerâs Questions on Wednesday âbecause thereâs been tens of thousands of deathsâ and the bereaved families âneed to have some answersâ. Earlier todayPrime Minister Boris Johnson committed to ""an independent inquiryinto what happened"" during the UK coronavirus pandemic sometime ""in the future"". Mr Davey said he had since written to the prime minister asking him to âconfirm that it should be an inquiry under the Inquiries Act 2005,â which the acting leader claims would give it âreal teethâ¦ to get to the bottom of the issue"". âWeâve got to get on with it,"" he told the BBC. There have been more than 290,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 45,000 people have died, government figures show. Both case numbers and the death toll has been falling steadily, but concern remains over possible localised spikes in infection. Take a look atthe latest data on confirmed cases in your area. As coronavirus cases continue to climb, particularly in southern US states like Texas and Florida, many school districts are considering a combination of online and in-person learning - though the White House has continued to push for complete reopenings. A newPolitico/Morning Consult poll,externalhas found that a majority of voters do not think schools and daycare should fully open, in-person, this autumn. The poll also found that 65% of voters disagree with President Trump's threat to cut funding for schools that refuse to reopen. Another poll fromNavigator Research,externalon Wednesday said the number of parents who oppose reopening schools has jumped from 31% at the start of June to 51% as of 15 July. On Tuesday,an Axios/Ipsos poll,externalalso reported most parents, including a slim majority of Republicans, say it is risky to reopen schools. Now, a post to make you hungry if you've skipped lunch and are still a while away from dinner. Nando's, Pret A Manger and McDonald's are among the UK food chains to promise reductions in their prices after the chancellor ordered a temporary VAT cut from 20% to 5%. As a reminder, VAT is the tax you pay on everyday goods and services and is usually included in the price most consumers see. Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced the Â£4bn cut in VAT - which will stay in place until 12 January 2021- to help firms recover in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic and get consumers spending. The Treasury estimates households could save Â£160 a year on average, but not all companies will pass on the benefit. Many firms are expected to use the windfall to shore up finances hit by the lockdown rather than cut prices for customers. You can read more here. Governor Kevin Stitt Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt has announced he has tested positive for Covid-19. He is the first governor to publicly announce a virus diagnosis so far, US media report. ""I feel fine, I felt a little bit achy yesterday,"" the Republican governor told reporters. He said is isolating from his family - who have tested negative - and working from home. Stitt attended President Trump's controversialrally in Tulsa, Oklahoma,on 20 June, which local health officials have said was likely to have contributed to the city's recent spike in Covid-19 cases. The governor also told reporters he does not plan to make masks mandatory across the state. ""I'm so proud of how we've handled it this far,"" he said of the state's response to the pandemic. Shortly after the announcement, the Oklahoma Department of Health reported 1,075 additional cases - a new single-day record for the state,according to KOCO News,external. Three people who left a coronavirus-hit farm in England's West Midlands have now been traced,a council has said. Vegetable producers A S Green and Co in Mathon, Herefordshire,went into lockdown after testsshowed 74 people had tested positive for Covid-19. Of the three workers who left against advice, one had tested positive. They are all now self-isolating. A joint statement released on Wednesday from Herefordshire Council and Public Health Midlands said: ""Three workers (one of whom tested positive) left the farm despite being asked to remain on site and isolate. ""All three of these individuals have been reached through the agency that secured their employment, and all have confirmed they are self-isolating."" About 200 workers are said to be in quarantine at the site's live-in accommodation. The farm employs a mix of seasonal workers from the UK and abroad. Starbucks and Walmart on Wednesday announced new mask requirements in all  US stores amid Covid-19 surges in a number of regions across the country. Starbucks says facial coverings will be required for patrons and staff in all its cafes as of 15 July. The coffee retailer says it will also limit the number of customers allowed inside to maintain social distancing. Retail giant Walmart will enact a similar policy in its more than 5,000 stores by 20 July, and noted many stores were in regions already under government mandates regarding facial coverings. The company also said employees would receive special training to assist customers. ""We know it may not be possible for everyone to wear a face covering,"" company officials said. ""Our associates will be trained on those exceptions to help reduce friction for the shopper and make the process as easy as possible for everyone."" UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak has defended his job retention bonus scheme after MPs questioned its value for money. The policy - which was announced last week - will see the government pay employers Â£1,000 for every furloughed worker they retain past January. MPs on the Commons Treasury Committee described the scheme as ""badly-timed and poorly-targeted"". But Sunak said he believed it would ""serve as a significant incentive"" to preserve jobs amid the pandemic. Labour's Angela Eagle cautioned that scheme risked spending taxpayers' money for no benefit. ""Surely you could have had less deadweight if you'd have focused support on different sectors, why didn't you do that?"" she asked. But Sunak insisted the scheme ""will and can make a difference"". Kai Wei says people in Beijing have adopted a ""keep calm and carry on"" attitude As countries far and wide cautiously emerge from lockdowns, some places are regrettably heading back into them. From Europe to Australia, Asia to the US, restrictions are being reimposed in areas where coronavirus infections are on the rise again. The Chinese capital, Beijing, was among those places. We spoke to Kai Wei, a 29-year-old resident of the city, who gave us her guide to surviving a second lockdown. Kai's advice was to keep a happiness balance sheet, trying every means to stay entertained and sane. ""Live as normally as possible. And always wear a mask when you can go out!""

"Apple has been told it will not have to pay Ireland â¬13bn (Â£11.6bn) in back taxes after winning an appeal at the European Union's second-highest court. It overturns a 2016 ruling which found the tech giant had been given illegal tax breaks by Dublin. The EU's General Court said it had annulled that decision because there was not enough evidence to show Apple broke EU competition rules. It is a blow for the European Commission, which brought the case. However, it has 14 days to appeal against the decision at the EU's supreme court, the European Court of Justice. ""This case was not about how much tax we pay, but where we are required to pay it,"" Apple said in a statement. ""We're proud to be the largest taxpayer in the world, as we know the important role tax payments play in society."" The Irish government - which had also appealed against the ruling - said it had ""always been clear"" Apple received no special treatment. ""The correct amount of Irish tax was charged... in line with normal Irish taxation rules."" EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, who brought the case, said she would ""study the judgment and reflect on possible next steps"". Dutch MEP Paul Tang called the ruling ""deeply unfair"". ""I suspect that many people in Ireland think... 'Why is there a company that pays 0.05% in taxes?' I pay more taxes than Apple, for that matter. Many people pay more taxes."" Margrethe Vestager has been trying to crack down on tax avoidance The European Commission brought the action after claiming Ireland had allowed Apple to attribute nearly all its EU earnings to an Irish head office that existed only on paper, thereby avoiding paying tax on EU revenues. The commission said this constituted illegal aid given to Apple by the Irish state. Irish EU court appeal on Apple tax ruling But the Irish government argued that Apple should not have to repay the back taxes, deeming that its loss was worth it to make the country an attractive home for large companies. Ireland - which has one of the lowest corporate tax rates in the EU - is Apple's base for Europe, the Middle East and Africa. In Wednesday's ruling, the Luxembourg-based General Court sided with that position, saying there was not enough evidence to show Apple had received illegal state aid or minimised its tax bill. One rather curious feature of this case is that if the ruling had gone the other way, and Ireland had been on the losing side, its ""punishment"" for breaching EU law would have been to receive a large amount of money: taxes the Commission said were owed by Apple. That did not happen, so the ruling - subject to any appeal - means Apple doesn't in law owe the money, so Ireland won't get it. In some quarters of Ireland, there will be relief that an agreement that helped encourage Apple to invest has not been overturned after the event. But the sentiment is far from universal. A Sinn FÃ©in spokesman called it a bad day for the Irish taxpayer that would draw negative attention to the country's international tax reputation. There is growing criticism of so-called sweetheart tax deals across the European Union and the bloc has been trying to clamp down. The ruling will therefore be a blow to Ms Vestager, who has taken aim at a host of big corporations over their allegedly anti-competitive practices. Amazon v EU: Has the online giant met its match? Last year, she lost a case against Starbucks, which was accused of owing â¬30m in back taxes to the Netherlands. Rulings on Ikea and Nike's tax arrangements in that country are due soon. Jason Collins, partner and head of tax at law firm Pinsent Masons, said: ""Apple's victory shows that European courts are unwilling to call beneficial tax regimes state aid, even when designed to attract foreign investment - provided they apply the rules consistently. ""This will be a very welcome outcome for other multinationals who have been watching this case closely."" However, he said Brussels was likely to appeal and EU efforts to tackle tax avoidance would continue. ""We expect the EU to continue applying pressure in this area,"" he said.

"Mark Sutherland's appeal was unanimously rejected by Supreme Court judges A convicted paedophile has lost a Supreme Court challenge over using evidence in court gathered covertly by so-called paedophile hunters. Judges unanimously dismissed an appeal,externalwhich argued that evidence from vigilante groups breached a person's right to a private life. It was brought by Mark Sutherland, who was caught by Groom Resisters Scotland. Sutherland was subsequently convicted of attempting to communicate indecently with an older child. He was appealing his conviction on the grounds that the covert investigation - and the use of the resulting evidence by the authorities - breached his human right for his correspondence to be private. The UK's highest court ruled on Wednesday that the interests of children have priority over any interest a paedophile could have in being allowed to engage in criminal conduct. Lord Sales delivered the judgement via video link, stating that the panel of five justices found there was no interference with the accused's rights under Article 8. He said this was for two reasons - the first being that ""the activity in question should be capable of respect"", and that children also have rights. Lord Sales said the state had ""a special responsibility to protect children against sexual exploitation by adults"". ""This indicates that there is no protection under Article 8 for the communications by the accused in this case."" he said. ""The interests of children have priority over any interest a paedophile could have in being allowed to engage in the criminal conduct in issue here."". The state must ""deter offences against children"" and so prosecutors were entitled to use the evidence gathered by Groom Resisters Scotland to secure a conviction. Lord Sales delivered the unanimous judgement via video link Secondly, he said, Sutherland had ""no reasonable expectation of privacy"" in the circumstances. ""There was no prior relationship between the accused [Sutherland] and the decoy [from Groom Resisters Scotland] from which an expectation of privacy could be said to arise. ""In addition, the accused believed he was communicating with a 13-year-old child, and it was foreseeable that a child of that age might share any worrying communications with an adult"", Lord Sales said. He added that prosecutors had ""no additional positive obligation"" to protect Sutherland's interests in any way that would prevent the prosecutor making use of the evidence to prosecute the crimes. Sutherland went to meet someone he thought was a young boy at Partick Station Mark Sutherland brought the case after beingcaught by a group of ""paedophile hunters"" called Groom Resisters Scotland. In 2018, Sutherland, 37, matched up on Grindr with someone who, when he communicated with them, claimed to be a 13-year-old boy. Sutherland sent explicit pictures and made arrangements to meet the ""boy"". It was in fact 48-year-old Paul Devine. When Sutherland turned up at Partick Bus Station in Glasgow, he found two members of Mr Devine's group. The group confronted Sutherland at the arranged meeting, and waited with him until police arrived. They broadcast the encounter on social media and handed the evidence to the authorities. Sutherland was convicted in August 2018 of attempting to communicate indecently with an older child, and related offences, andjailed for two years. He had previously been jailed for sending explicit pictures to a 12-year-old boy. At a hearing in June, Sutherland's lawyersargued in court that his right to a private life had been breached. This right is enshrined in Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, and states that everyone has the right to respect for his or her private life and correspondence. His lawyer, Gordon Jackson QC, argued: ""The police are aware that there a number of hunter organisations operating in Scotland and the UK and evidence submitted from these organisations has led to a number of criminal investigations and convictions."" There is ""disquiet"" about the work of such groups, and police and prosecutors give them ""tacit encouragement"", Mr Jackson said. He argued that ""a huge number"" of cases were prosecuted on the basis of information from these organisations. According to HM Inspectorate of Constabulary in Scotland (HMICS), almost half of online grooming cases result from the activities of vigilante groups. The inspectorate said these groups are unregulated and untrained, and in itsreport in February 2020,externalsaid: ""A more robust proactive capability on the part of Police Scotland would reduce the opportunities for these groups to operate.""

"There are no plans to make face coverings mandatory for office workers in England, Matt Hancock has said. The health secretary told the BBC people working in offices would not need to cover up, despite anewspaper report suggesting,externalthey would. ""It is something we've looked at and rejected,"" he said, but added masks would be worn elsewhere by the public ""for the foreseeable future"". Face coverings in shops will become mandatory in England on 24 July. Those who fail to comply with the new rules on wearing face coverings in England's shops will face a fine of up to Â£100. Children under 11, those with certain disabilities, and people working in shops will be exempt. Scotland already requires shoppers to cover their faces while Wales and Northern Ireland are both weighing up similar policies. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Boris Johnsonhas committed for the first time to an ""independent inquiry""into the government's handling of the pandemic. It comes as the UK recorded a further 85 deaths of people who tested positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of deaths to 45,053. R number 'lower than thought' before lockdown end Why have attitudes to face masks changed? A user's guide to wearing your face mask to the shops Mr Hancock said face coverings helped prevent spread during short interactions with strangers, but that social distancing and hand washing were more effective for contact with people over long periods of time.

"There are no plans to make face coverings mandatory for office workers in England, Matt Hancock has said. The health secretary told the BBC people working in offices would not need to cover up, despite anewspaper report suggesting,externalthey would. ""It is something we've looked at and rejected,"" he said, but added masks would be worn elsewhere by the public ""for the foreseeable future"". Face coverings in shops will become mandatory in England on 24 July. Those who fail to comply with the new rules on wearing face coverings in England's shops will face a fine of up to Â£100. Children under 11, those with certain disabilities, and people working in shops will be exempt. Scotland already requires shoppers to cover their faces while Wales and Northern Ireland are both weighing up similar policies. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Boris Johnsonhas committed for the first time to an ""independent inquiry""into the government's handling of the pandemic.

The Tokyo 2020 Olympics in Japan had to be postponed because of Covid-19 American athletes due to compete in the Tokyo Olympics will be provided with additional mental health support after the games were postponed until next year, officials say. United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC) officials said Wednesday that three independent mental health officers would give support to athletes ahead of the competition scheduled for Japan 2021. ""As our world continues to evolve during the challenges of a global pandemic and Games postponement, we want to ensure our athletes have the resources they need to focus on their mental health,"" said Bahati VanPelt, the USOPC chief of athlete services. The International Olympic Committee earlier said it was ""fully committed"" to the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 and had ""multiple scenarios"" for them to take place safely.  An investigation into a coronavirus-hit farm in Herefordshire has now been widened to include others in England and Scotland. The total number of positive coronavirus cases linked to the outbreak at AS Green & Co in Mathon now stands at 93, Public Health England (PHE) said. In an update on Wednesday evening, PHE said 76 workers who travelled on to other farms in England came to the UK on the same flight as the Herefordshire farm workers. It added that these 76 people have already been offered testing and no further cases have been identified to date. A further 63 workers who travelled on to Scottish farms were on the same flight. PHE said it has notified public health authorities in Scotland so this groupcan be ""followed-up appropriately"". A group of workers who travelled to the UK by private coach, including some of those who went on to work at AS Green and Co, are also being followed up, it added. Another worker fled the farm, despite being told not to. PHE said the agency that employed the worker (who tested negative for the virus) is in contact with them and has been advised they are self-isolating.Three other workers who fled the farm earlier have been traced. Karen Wright, director of Public Health for Herefordshire, said as testing of workers at the farm continues, officials expect to see the number of cases rise over the coming days ""before social distancing and infection prevention measures start to take effect"". She added that workers have been asked to remain on site and self-isolate to ""reduce risk of spread within the workforce and into the wider community"", and food and essential supplies were being delivered to the farm during this time. She said she knows local residents are concerned, but added the risk to the general public ""remains low"" The group said the Turkish villagers seemed seemed happy to host them Travel plans have been disrupted, borders have been closed and venues of all kinds have been shut during the pandemic. This posed a perfect storm of problems for a group of young musicians, whose road trip across Asia was brought to a standstill earlier this year. The band, called Tango Maluco, found themselves hunkering down in the most unlikely place - Erenler, a remote village in Turkey's Black Sea region. One member of the four-piece group, Mirjam Ellenbrok, told the BBC they got stuck in the village after the borders suddenly closed along their route. The group has made the most of their time, however, learning from the locals how to cook village specialities and prepare yogurt from cow's milk, while gardening in the lush surroundings. Read the full storyto see how the group whiled away the time in the mountain village. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Official Chinese media say that an undisclosed number of customers and delivery personnel have been told to self-isolate in southeastern China after Covid-19 was detected on shrimp containers imported from Ecuador. According to the official CGTN broadcaster, Covid-19 was detected on imported samples in the city of Pingxiang in Jiangxi province. The local government says that âno abnormal situation has been found in the city so farâ to suggest a potential localised outbreak. This is the second time this week that samples of seafood products have tested positive from the South American country. On Monday, the official China Daily said that seafood from three Ecuadorian companies were being pulled from shelves after six samples from inside shipping containers and the outer packaging of shrimp tested positive at customs. Many local governments and online retailers quickly issued suspension orders on these products and said that they were carrying out tests. In recent weeks, Chinese consumers have been nervous about eating seafood, after chopping boards used for imported salmon tested positive at a wholesale market in Beijing. It is believed this led to 335 people being infected across the capital city, and led to Beijing implementing a strict lockdown and aggressive testing procedures. A UK bingo chain has announced the permanent closure of 26 of its halls, putting 573 jobs at risk. Buzz Bingo, which is based in Nottingham, said it had taken the decision due to an ""unsustainable operating environment for the foreseeable future"". Its remaining 91 halls will continue to trade when they reopen from 6 August. Chief executive Chris Matthews said a restructure would ensure those clubs were able to adapt to new coronavirus safety measures and lower customer numbers. Buzz Bingo had to close its sites on 21 March due to the UK government lockdown and furloughed the majority of its staff. The company, which employs about 3,400 people, said it would ""take time"" for footfall at sites to reach pre-virus levels due to social distancing measures and weaker customer confidence.

Sweden's coronavirus containment strategy has been widely criticised Large parts of Swedenâs population are still susceptible to the coronavirus, the countryâs health authorities have said, casting further doubt on the so-called herd immunity strategy. Herd immunity happens when a large proportion of a population develops immunity to a contagious disease, be it through community transmission or vaccination. Sweden has seen far more coronavirus cases than any of its Nordic neighbours, recording 76,492 infections and 5,572 deaths to date,a Johns Hopkins University tally says,external. Sweden did not pursue a full lockdown, instead relying on voluntary social distancing and limited restrictions, such as the banning of large gatherings. The countryâs top epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, has previously expressed hope that herd immunity may be a useful by-product of the strategy, though not its aim. But on Tuesday a senior Swedish health official, Karin Tegmark Wisell, said large parts of Swedenâs population âhavenât been infectedâ by the coronavirus, meaning they are still susceptible. Earlier this month,a study from Spain raised questions about the feasibility of herd immunityas a way of tackling the coronavirus pandemic. Sir Ed Davey is one of two contenders for the leadership of the Liberal Democrat party Acting Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey has said an independent inquiry into the handling of coronavirus in the UK âcanât come soon enough for bereaved families.â Sir Ed said he had called for the inquiry at Prime Ministerâs Questions on Wednesday âbecause thereâs been tens of thousands of deathsâ and the bereaved families âneed to have some answersâ. Earlier todayPrime Minister Boris Johnson committed to ""an independent inquiryinto what happened"" during the UK coronavirus pandemic sometime ""in the future"". Mr Davey said he had since written to the prime minister asking him to âconfirm that it should be an inquiry under the Inquiries Act 2005,â which the acting leader claims would give it âreal teethâ¦ to get to the bottom of the issue"". âWeâve got to get on with it,"" he told the BBC. There have been more than 290,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 45,000 people have died, government figures show. Both case numbers and the death toll has been falling steadily, but concern remains over possible localised spikes in infection. Take a look atthe latest data on confirmed cases in your area. As coronavirus cases continue to climb, particularly in southern US states like Texas and Florida, many school districts are considering a combination of online and in-person learning - though the White House has continued to push for complete reopenings. A newPolitico/Morning Consult poll,externalhas found that a majority of voters do not think schools and daycare should fully open, in-person, this autumn. The poll also found that 65% of voters disagree with President Trump's threat to cut funding for schools that refuse to reopen. Another poll fromNavigator Research,externalon Wednesday said the number of parents who oppose reopening schools has jumped from 31% at the start of June to 51% as of 15 July. On Tuesday,an Axios/Ipsos poll,externalalso reported most parents, including a slim majority of Republicans, say it is risky to reopen schools. Now, a post to make you hungry if you've skipped lunch and are still a while away from dinner. Nando's, Pret A Manger and McDonald's are among the UK food chains to promise reductions in their prices after the chancellor ordered a temporary VAT cut from 20% to 5%. As a reminder, VAT is the tax you pay on everyday goods and services and is usually included in the price most consumers see. Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced the Â£4bn cut in VAT - which will stay in place until 12 January 2021- to help firms recover in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic and get consumers spending. The Treasury estimates households could save Â£160 a year on average, but not all companies will pass on the benefit. Many firms are expected to use the windfall to shore up finances hit by the lockdown rather than cut prices for customers. You can read more here. Governor Kevin Stitt Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt has announced he has tested positive for Covid-19. He is the first governor to publicly announce a virus diagnosis so far, US media report. ""I feel fine, I felt a little bit achy yesterday,"" the Republican governor told reporters. He said is isolating from his family - who have tested negative - and working from home. Stitt attended President Trump's controversialrally in Tulsa, Oklahoma,on 20 June, which local health officials have said was likely to have contributed to the city's recent spike in Covid-19 cases. The governor also told reporters he does not plan to make masks mandatory across the state. ""I'm so proud of how we've handled it this far,"" he said of the state's response to the pandemic. Shortly after the announcement, the Oklahoma Department of Health reported 1,075 additional cases - a new single-day record for the state,according to KOCO News,external. Three people who left a coronavirus-hit farm in England's West Midlands have now been traced,a council has said. Vegetable producers A S Green and Co in Mathon, Herefordshire,went into lockdown after testsshowed 74 people had tested positive for Covid-19. Of the three workers who left against advice, one had tested positive. They are all now self-isolating. A joint statement released on Wednesday from Herefordshire Council and Public Health Midlands said: ""Three workers (one of whom tested positive) left the farm despite being asked to remain on site and isolate. ""All three of these individuals have been reached through the agency that secured their employment, and all have confirmed they are self-isolating."" About 200 workers are said to be in quarantine at the site's live-in accommodation. The farm employs a mix of seasonal workers from the UK and abroad. Starbucks and Walmart on Wednesday announced new mask requirements in all  US stores amid Covid-19 surges in a number of regions across the country. Starbucks says facial coverings will be required for patrons and staff in all its cafes as of 15 July. The coffee retailer says it will also limit the number of customers allowed inside to maintain social distancing. Retail giant Walmart will enact a similar policy in its more than 5,000 stores by 20 July, and noted many stores were in regions already under government mandates regarding facial coverings. The company also said employees would receive special training to assist customers. ""We know it may not be possible for everyone to wear a face covering,"" company officials said. ""Our associates will be trained on those exceptions to help reduce friction for the shopper and make the process as easy as possible for everyone."" UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak has defended his job retention bonus scheme after MPs questioned its value for money. The policy - which was announced last week - will see the government pay employers Â£1,000 for every furloughed worker they retain past January. MPs on the Commons Treasury Committee described the scheme as ""badly-timed and poorly-targeted"". But Sunak said he believed it would ""serve as a significant incentive"" to preserve jobs amid the pandemic. Labour's Angela Eagle cautioned that scheme risked spending taxpayers' money for no benefit. ""Surely you could have had less deadweight if you'd have focused support on different sectors, why didn't you do that?"" she asked. But Sunak insisted the scheme ""will and can make a difference"". Kai Wei says people in Beijing have adopted a ""keep calm and carry on"" attitude As countries far and wide cautiously emerge from lockdowns, some places are regrettably heading back into them. From Europe to Australia, Asia to the US, restrictions are being reimposed in areas where coronavirus infections are on the rise again. The Chinese capital, Beijing, was among those places. We spoke to Kai Wei, a 29-year-old resident of the city, who gave us her guide to surviving a second lockdown. Kai's advice was to keep a happiness balance sheet, trying every means to stay entertained and sane. ""Live as normally as possible. And always wear a mask when you can go out!"" Read our pieceto see what other people living under second lockdowns have advised. From today, holidaymakers can take direct flights to Greece from the UK. So which other countries can you now visit and what do you need to do when you return? Passengers entering the UK from dozens of countries no longer have to quarantine for two weeks thanks to a relaxation of the government's travel quarantine rules on Friday. More than 50 countries - including many popular holiday spots - now pose ''a reduced risk'' from coronavirus, the government says. WalesandNorthern Irelandhave introduced quarantine exemptions for the same countries as England. Scotland is also allowing exemptions, although unlike the other nationsdoes not exempt travellers from Spain, because of concerns about their rate of coronavirus. You can read more here. Another 85 people have died in UK hospitals, care homes and the community after testing positive for coronavirus, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) says. It brings UK deaths to 45,053 under that measure, but the figures do not include all deaths involving Covid-19 across the UK, which are thought to have passed 55,500. The DHSC also said that in the 24-hours up to 09:00 BST on Wednesday, there had been a further 538 lab-confirmed UK cases. Overall, a total of 291,911 cases have been confirmed. Iran has recorded more than 260,000 coronavirus infections Iran has said 140 of its health workers have died with Covid-19 since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. ""We all owe them our lives and to honour them, we must observe health protocols,â said Sima Sadat Lari, an Iranian health ministry official. The country has seen a rapid surge in the number of coronavirus cases recently, after relaxing its lockdown restrictions in mid-April. So far, Iran has recorded 264,561 infections and 13,410 deaths since the start of the pandemic,according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University,external. Health officials have suggested the renewed surge in new infections could be attributed to more testing, and they have said people were ignoring social-distancing rules. On Wednesday Iranian President Hassan Rohani urged people to respect health regulations, in particular social distancing. ""We ask the people to avoid all gatherings and to adapt the way of life to the current situation,â President Hassan Rohani said at a cabinet meeting.

Mike Pompeo has taken a hardline against China during the pandemic The World Health Organizationâs (WHO) inquiry into the coronavirus pandemic will be a âcompletely white-washed investigationâ, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said, as he lashed out at China. Mr Pompeo accused China of failing to disclose information about the coronavirus when the first cases were detected in the city of Wuhan last year. That failure, Mr Pompeo said, had âkilled over 100,000 Americans and âcost the global economy trillions and trillions of dollarsâ. âAnd now it is allowing the World Health Organization to go in to conduct what I am confident will be a completely, a completely white-washed investigation,â Mr Pompeo said at a news conference on Wednesday. Mr Pompeo appears to be referring to an independent inquiry into the global response to the coronavirus pandemic, launched by the WHO earlier this month. Chaired by two former world leaders, the panel will be tasked with analysing responses to the pandemic by member states and the WHO itself. The panel will not, however, look into the origin of the coronavirus, as Mr Pompeo and other world leaders had demanded. Throughout the pandemic, the Trump administration has implicated the WHO in an alleged cover-up by the Chinese in the early stages of the pandemic.

"Maurice Roeves, right, played the villain Robert in Scottish television drama River City alongside Johnny Beattie and Jayd Johnson Actor Maurice Roeves - known for playing villains and hard men - has died at the age of 83. In a career spanning six decades, he acted in hundreds of TV shows and films including The Sweeney, Star Trek, The Eagle Has Landed and Tutti Frutti. Born in Sunderland, the actor was brought up in Glasgow and launched his career at the city's Citizen's Theatre. He also appeared in Eastenders, River City, Doctor Who and Irvine Welsh's The Acid House. Roeves' most recent role was a small part in the 2020 BBC television dramaThe Nest. His wife Vanessa Roeves told the BBC that he had been in ill health for some time. Despite playing tough characters on screen, Vanessa said Roeves was a ""softie"" in real life and that no part was too small for her husband. She said he was keen to be involved in his last project, despite the small appearance. And when Tutti Frutti was played on the launch of the BBC Scotland Channel, she said Roeves was delighted at having come ""full circle"". Vanessa also said that the family would often joke, ""Does your character make it to the end of this one?"" because his characters would always be killed off. However, Roeves found success at a time where lots of working class actors were just managing to break through into the mainstream, such as Albert Finney and Richard Harris. One of the hard man characters he played was the sinister McGurn (left) in the comedy series Rab C Nesbitt The Roeves family moved to Glasgow when he was seven years old as his father had a cotton mill in Partick. He went to school in the city and when he left full time education he took an an office job to earn money. But he returned to his studies and secured a place at the then Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama - now the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland. While there he won a gold medal for his acting. Maurice Roeves as Stotz in the Dr Who adventure The Caves of Androzani After graduating he got a job at the Citizens Theatre as an assistant stage manager but found himself playing small roles in between sweeping the stage floor. His first major role was as Lorenzo in the Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice when apparently screaming fans would gather at the stage door after the show to catch a glimpse of Maurice. Following this performance Disney sent a scout to Glasgow to see Roeves perform. He was then screen tested and offered his first film role, marking his debut in a career that would stretch more than 60 years of television and film. Roeves' film debut was in The Fighting Prince of Donegal in 1966, where he played the Irishman. Despite launching his film career, he continued in theatre roles. His next major role was in Macbeth at the Royal Court in London where he played Macduff, next to Sir Alec Guinness' Macbeth. One memorable Holywood screen role for Roeves was in Last of the Mohicans acting beside Daniel Day-Lewis and Wes Studi. Studi played Magua, a native American villain who ripped the heart out of Col Edmund Munro, played by Roeves. His friendship with Wes Studi lasted for more than 25 years and they met often near Wes's home in Santa Fe. Studisaid on social media,externalthat they shared haggis together. Allow Twitter content?

"Driving lessons will resume in Wales from 27 July, the first minister has confirmed and will be done ""safely for everyone concerned"". A drop in the speed of coronavirus tests coming back to Wales was due to a ""series of difficulties"" at one laboratory in England Two more deaths were reported by Public Health Wales on Wednesday but the daily average is now less than one Wales' new testing strategy has been unveiled, with ministers promising that anyone who needs a test can access one New parents have been left socially isolated during lockdown and unaware of how to get help, a charity has claimed Nicola Bryan, Catherine Evans and Steve Duffy That's it from us. Weâll be back tomorrow with all the latest on the
coronavirus in Wales. In the meantime, you can keep up to datehere. Here's a recap of today's main developments: New parents have been left
""socially isolated"" during lockdown and unaware of how to get help,
the National Childbirth Trust has claimed. Bethan
Sayed, a Plaid Cymru Senedd member (MS) who gave birth in April, said the support she has received was
""sporadic"". She carried out her

recover from the Covid-19 pandemic hasreceived a mixed reaction
from traders. Visiting
Rhyl in Denbighshire, Deputy Minister for Housing and Local Government Hannah Blythyn
said the capital funding moved from theTransforming Towns scheme,externalwould
support traders and improve public safety. But
one businesses owner there said it was a ""drop in the ocean"". Another
said adaptations could improve shoppers' confidence. There have been two more reported deaths from coronavirus in Wales, bringing the total to 1,545. The most recent reported deaths, by Public Health Wales, were from the Cwm Taf Morgannwg area.  An opposition politician has criticised the timescale for driving lessons resuming in Wales. Lessons will be able to resume from 27 July, the first minister has told the Senedd. Conservative member of the Senedd (MS) for Clwyd Darren Millar said learners and instructors had been ""crying out"" for a date but would undoubtedly be ""disappointed and frustrated"" that they have got to wait a further two weeks for lessons and even longer for tests. âLike with everything the Welsh Government announces with regards coming out of lockdown, there is always an unnecessary time lapse.â Two more people have died from coronavirus in Wales. According to today's report from Public Health Wales, there have been two more reported deaths and 18 new cases, bringing the total number of deaths to 1,545. There have been 16,854 confirmed cases of coronavirus in Wales. Credit cards spending
dropped by nearly halfat the start of lockdown as people played safe with
their finances and shunned big purchases. A
total of Â£8.7bn was spent on credit cards in the first full month of lockdown
in April, half the level of April last year, UK Finance said. The
banking trade body said this was the lowest level of spending seen since the
last economic downturn. The
cancellation of holiday plans is one likely reason for the fall. There are no current plans to ban smoking outside pubs, Mr Gething says. He said there had been no change to government plans on smoking regulations. He added: âThe more immediate point is the ban on smoking in playgrounds, school grounds, and hospitals, which I think enjoys widespread support across the public."" He said any future proposals are ones for âanother termâ of a Welsh Government.  Not all care workers visiting people's homes will be routinely tested for coronavirus, the health minister says. There have been calls to test all domiciliary carers who look after people in their own homes, regardless of whether they have symptoms, as happens with staff in care homes. Domciliary carers are only tested when they have symptoms. Vaughan Gething said some would receive anitbody tests, which show if people have had the disease, as part of a new surveillance plan. âThe evidence that we have had and published today doesn't support testing the whole sector as the right approach,â he said. âIt does underpin though, as I've said, everyone who has symptoms should get a test and self-isolate. âIt also underpins actually the importance of a move from the UK government on statutory sick pay or supportive pay where people are advised by the contact tracing service to self-isolate as they have in Germany. Speaking ahead of his press conference, opposition parties called for domiciliary carers to receive more testing. Conservative shadow social care minister Janet Finch Saunders said the service had âgone under the radarâ. âIf you work in domiciliary care, social care, district nurse, occupational therapy, physiotherapy â anybody going to somebodyâs home receiving care in the community, I think you should be tested,â she said. Age Cymruâs chief executive Victoria Lloyd said: âWe have been clear about the need for adequate and practical access to fast testing for all social care staff to support infection control measures. ""As such we would support a programme of regular testing for domiciliary care staff."" The difficulties that England are experiencing in making face masks compulsory in different settings showed that it ""isnât a
straightforward question,"" according to Vaughan Gething. The health minister said there were issues with ""enforceability"" and with ""questioning people"" who arenât wearing masks. Mr Gething confirmed it was the Welsh Governmentâs position not to make the wearing of face masks in
shops mandatory. First Minister Mark Drakeford said people were advised to wear face
coverings in crowded areas but has resisted calls to enforce people to do so. Mr Gething
said that the Welsh Government was continuing to take advice from the chief medical officer and following global scientific evidence regarding face
coverings. âIf that
evidence was to change, we would happily consider changing our position,â he
said. âFace
coverings are the last tier of measures to take, in the sense of protecting all
of us. It still starts by following that social-distancing guidance. Itâs much
more important than wearing a face covering. ""A face
covering wonât protect you if youâre bumping along with other people instead of
observing social distancing.â He also said the advice on face coverings may change if the government had to
enforce a local lockdown as has happened in Leicester and Blackburn.  You should still work from home if you can and avoid using
public transport where possible, the Welsh Government has said. It tweeted its latest workplace guidelines and said employers
must do all they can to keep 2 metres distance and protect those who need to
return to the workplace.  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Wearing a face covering could be a mandatory part of any future local lockdown, according to the first minister. Face coverings will be mandatory on public transport in Wales from 27 July. Mark Drakeford said he was also considering the use of face masks in supermarkets and crowded tourist destinations in Wales. Speaking at first minister's questions, Mr Drakeford said that they were keeping everything ""under review"". ""I've asked for further advice for example, on suggestions that supermarkets in tourist destinations have been crowded over this last weekend as populations in those areas increase. ""Mandatory use of face coverings as part of a local lockdown, should that become necessary, will certainly be part of a potential repertoire here in Wales. ""And if the prevalence of coronavirus in Wales were to rise, our advice would be revisited. ""In the meantime, the position in Wales is anybody going into a shop who wishes to wear a face mask is absolutely entitled to do so. ""Our advice is that if it is crowded you should wear one."" But he said that for now the advice from Wales' Chief Medical Officer ""has not changed. They have a marginal utility, but they also have identifiable downsides."" Since mid June all care staff have been tested for coronavirus on a weekly basis which has shown the prevalence of the virus in care homes to be low, said the health minister. The most recent figures show there have been a total of 28,763 tests on care home residents. This is 706 more than the week before but 95.6% of tests proved negative - and only three residents tested positive in the last week. Figures show 60,464 staff had been tested too; 98% of tests were negative. Vaughan Gething said low case numbers was ""very good news"" but low prevalence of the disease was likely to generate a higher rate of false positives. He said that this had implications for the use of antigen tests as a screening tool and for those individuals who may be asked to self isolate. The Welsh Government would continue to test care home staff on a weekly basis for a further four weeks. ""If low prevalence trends continue during this period we will move to a fortnightly regime for antigen testing. Alongside this, we will roll out a surveillance programme of antibody testing for social care and domiciliary staff"", he added. The new coronavirus testing strategy will ensure  immediate action is taken if new cases are identified in communities, the health minister has promised. This would include using mobile testing units to test all care home staff and residents, Vaughan Gething said. He said if care homes were identified as higher risk - for example because of local outbreaks - bespoke testing regimes would be implemented. ""This risk-based approach will also apply to other settings and localities, enabling local teams to use testing as part of a wider approach to surveillance and outbreak control"". Health Minister Vaughan Gething has outlined the Welsh Government's new coronavirus testing strategy. Speaking at the daily coronavirus news briefing, he said the strategy sets out ""why, where and how we will test to achieve clear outcomes"". Mr Gething said the Welsh Government's testing priorities for the coming weeks and months would be:  He said: ""An enormous amount has been achieved over the past few months and I would like to thank everyone for their contribution. But, we now need to prepare ourselves for this next phase â and for what might be a difficult winter"". Walesâ new coronavirus
  testing strategy has been published by the health minister. Vaughan Gething  said the strategy focused on four main areas:  There are
  currently two different forms of testing in Wales; the antigen virus
  detection test that shows if someone currently has the virus, and the
  antibody test which is used to determine whether a person has been
  previously infected. He said the weekly testing programme for care homes would continue for
  another four weeks, with the data on prevalence rates closely monitored. If
  prevalence rates remained at the current low levels then the testing cycle would move fortnightly. Mr Gething, said: âWe now have a national testing infrastructure that means
  anyone who needs a test can access one. This enables our contact tracing
  system to help control the transmission of the disease as lockdown measures
  are eased. âOur NHS Wales Test, Trace, Protect service is
  fundamental to helping us to find a way to live with the disease until a
  vaccine or treatment is available."" The Welsh Government's daily coronavirus briefing is due to start at 12:30 BST. Today's speaker is Health Minister Vaughan Gething and he is expected to give details of Wales' new coronavirus testing strategy. We'll give you the main updates here - you can also watch the
proceedings on BBC One Wales, vis theBBC iPlayerand

"This video can not be played ""Their freedom has been taken away"" China has vowed to retaliate after the US ended Hong Kong's preferential trade status and imposed sanctions on officials who crack down on rights. President Donald Trump said he was acting because China had taken away Hong Kong's freedom after it imposed a new security law. Beijing condemned Mr Trump's decision, saying it would impose sanctions on relevant people and entities in the US. US-China ties have become increasingly strained over a wide range of issues. Apart from Beijing's actions in Hong Kong, Mr Trump has criticised China over its handling of the coronavirus pandemic as well as its military build-up in the South China Sea, its treatment of Muslim minorities and massive trade surpluses. Mr Trump's decision means the end of Hong Kong's special trade status with the US, agreed in 1984 when the territory was still a British colony.Hong Kong is expected to be treated the same as mainland China, meaning its goods could be subjected to additional tariffs. The controversial security law - which effectively outlaws criticism of China's government - is the most sweeping change to the political landscape of Hong Kong since the UK handed back sovereignty to Beijing in 1997. Mr Trump also said he had signed the Hong Kong Autonomy Act, which passed unanimously in Congress earlier this month and penalises banks doing business with Chinese officials who implement the security law. This video can not be played Tea, drugs and war: Hong Kong's British history explained In a strongly worded statement, China's foreign ministry described the decision as a ""gross interference"" in its domestic affairs and said the country would impose retaliatory sanctions to ""safeguard China's legitimate interests"". ""The US attempt to obstruct the implementation of the national security law for Hong Kong will never succeed,"" the statement said. ""We urge the US side to correct its mistakes, refrain from implementing the act and stop interfering in China's internal affairs in any way. China will firmly respond if the US goes ahead."" Speaking in the Rose Garden on Tuesday, Mr Trump said the executive order was intended to ""hold China accountable for its aggressive actions against the people"" of Hong Kong. ""No special privileges [for Hong Kong], no special economic treatment and no export of sensitive technologies,"" said the president, who first announced in May that his administration would begin paring back the territory's special status. According to a document released by the White House,external, any dealings in US property by anyone determined to be responsible for or complicit in ""actions or policies that undermine democratic processes or institutions in Hong Kong"" would be blocked. It also directs officials to ""revoke license exceptions for exports to Hong Kong,"" and includes revoking special treatment for Hong Kong passport holders. Mr Trump said the Hong Kong Autonomy Act gave the administration ""powerful new tools to hold responsible the individuals and the entities involved in extinguishing Hong Kong's freedom"". After being questioned by a journalist, the president said he had no plans to speak to Chinese President Xi Jinping. Mr Trump also said his administration held China ""fully responsible for concealing the [coronavirus] and unleashing it upon the world"". His own response to the pandemic has been under scrutiny, as the US has 3.4 million recorded cases, the highest in the world, and more than 136,000 deaths. The president's policy address digressed into a lengthy political attack on his Democratic presidential challenger, Joe Biden, ranging from trade and immigration to policing and climate change. THE US MOVE:Should US firms be worried about Hong Kong sanctions? RISING TENSIONS:The Hong Kong crisis and the new world order THE NEW LAW:What it is and why Hong Kong is worried WHAT COULD HAPPEN:Life sentences for breaking the law and more ALSO IN THE REGION:What might happen next in the South China Sea? It was not a matter of if, but when. Scrapping Hong Kong's special status will mean companies based there will now have to evaluate what this means for them. Hong Kong is a re-exporting hub, which means that goods that go through Hong Kong to the US but have come from somewhere else - like China for instance - have avoided the tariffs the US has slapped on China. Now that Hong Kong's special status is gone - mainland Chinese companies may look for another place to send their goods - which would see Hong Kong's port and logistics businesses suffer. And how much of an impact will this have on American and multinational companies using Hong Kong as a regional hub? Well, as one business consultant told me - the structural reasons for why a company would use Hong Kong as a hub are still there - low tax rates, good geographic location, convertibility of currency. But perception is reality - and if the perception is that doing business in Hong Kong has become so much more onerous - why not decamp to mainland China or Singapore instead? With Mr Trump facing an uphill battle for re-election this November, he and Mr Biden have accused each other of being weak on China. On Monday, the administration condemned China's military build-up in the South China Sea, accusing it of bullying neighbours. Last Friday, Mr Trump told reporters on Air Force One that a ""phase two"" trade deal with China was in doubt because of its handling of coronavirus, which he called the ""plague"". This video can not be played Many Hong Kong residents are worried the new security law means the ""one country, two systems"" principle no longer exists The US also officially withdrew last week from the World Health Organization, which Mr Trump had accused of being beholden to China. Last week, too, the Trump administration announced sanctions against Chinese politicians who it says are responsible for human rights violations against Muslim minorities in Xinjiang.

"There is now almost no excuse for notwearing a face mask while out shopping in England- covering your face is as essential as remembering your cash or bank card. The rulesdiffer a little around the UK. But wherever you live, it's going to be hard to avoid covering up your mouth and nose. And that raises a host of dilemmas. This is important to get right. The key things are to clean your hands before you put it on and take it off, and to make sure it fits snugly so there aren't any gaps between the material and your face. This video can not be played Coronavirus: How to wear a face covering Of course if your mask doesn't fit properly you can always adjust it, or tie it in a slightly more convenient way. But it needs to cover both your mouth and nose and also go up to the top of your nose, hooking behind your ears or the back of your head. And remember, the idea is no gaps. Got it? You're good to go. When buying your mask the first thing you need to decide is what sort you want. The governmentsays surgical masks and respirators should be reserved for those who need them to protect against risks in their workplace,,externalsuch as NHS staff and care workers. But you can still buy non-medical disposable face coverings, reusable cloth coverings, or evenitems like scarves and bandanas.,external If single-use coverings are what you're after, you could head to a pharmacy - high street chains like Boots, Superdrug and Lloyds all sell them. And they're available on online sites like Amazon. But more and more clothes retailers are also joining the marketplace with reusable fabric masks. In fact, it seems everywhere now sells reusable masks - from your local corner shop, to your favourite football club, to independent retailers on Etsy. From ditsy designs to animal prints, there are a range of ""fashion masks"" on sites like Asos or Boohoo, or in shops like Oliver Bonas. No, sorry, that's not allowed. Coronavirus is spread when droplets are sprayed into the air when infected people cough or sneeze - but also when they talk. Those droplets can then fall on surfaces. So it would defeat the point if you take it off to have a natter, really. This video can not be played Stop your glasses steaming up with a mask on It's a worry that has been burdening many spectacle-wearers. It's a legitimate one, too - lenses can steam up when you wear a mask because your warm breath comes out of the top of the mask, hitting the cooler lenses and clouding them up. The extra moisture can also mean that nose pads become slippery and your frames glasses slide down your face. The key is to try, if possible, to make sure there aren't any gaps for the air to escape around your nose and cheeks. You could try tucking the mask behind your glasses, or tucking some tissue inside the top of the covering. The opticiansSpecsavers recommends,externalresting your glasses on top of your mask to help seal any gap, or using a piece of surgical tape to secure the mask to the bridge of your nose. Failing that you could try washing your glasses in soapy water to stop them misting up. A face covering should cover your mouth and nose while allowing you to breathe comfortably. But if you have a medical issue and suffer from breathing difficulties, it might not be quite that simple. You may well already be among those exempt from wearing face coverings on public transport in England. The government hasn't given the precise wording of the rules for shops yet, so you'll need to check those once they're out. But one tip from Asthma UK,externalis to try a few different types to see if there is one that suits you. It suggests trying one out at home, or on a short walk around the block before heading off to do your weekly shop. No, sorry (again). If your mask isn't washable, or if it's disposable,the government says it should go in your ""black bag"" or general waste bin,external(or a litter bin if you're outside) once you've worn it. Disposable face coverings should be thrown away after each use, or as soon as they are damp, according to the World Health Organization. This includes the lighter, pleated ones as well as the sturdier, particle-filtering masks. This video can not be played Coronavirus: 'The masks you throw away could end up killing a whale' The added waste has caused concern for environmentalists who say they're ending up in the sea. The government says if you're worried about this you can ""wash and reuse cloth face coverings"", or make your own. Whether you're handy with a sewing machine, you like cutting up old t-shirts, or just want a quick fix, the principles are the same: the more layers of material the better, and the mask needs to fit snugly around the face, and allow you to breathe comfortably. One study suggests the best materials to use are tightly-woven cottons or twill, natural silk or quilted cotton material. But you can also make do with what you have around your home. We've put togethera guide to different types and step-by-step instructionson how to make them. You should wash your fabric coverings after every use. That might sound like a lot, but the good news is you can put them in the washing machine with the rest of your clothes. Bandanas, face scarves and coverings made of fabric, like cotton, can be washed in your regular laundry using hot water, says US-based Johns Hopkins Medicine. You should wash it on the warmest appropriate water setting,external, but that depends on the type of material it's made from. Or you can hand wash them in hot, soapy water - scrubbing them for at least 20 seconds. After washing, tumble dry them on a high setting and store in a clean place. If you are air drying, keep them flat and try to dry them in direct sunlight. Johns Hopkins Medicine also suggests using a non-scented detergent if you are sensitive to perfumes. Some big high street names (Gap, Boots, Claire's to name just three) sell masks for children, alongside smaller manufacturers that have shifted their focus - including Thumbsie, which usually makes fabric gloves to help children stop sucking their thumbs. Vistaprint offers a range of face coverings with adjustable straps in kid-friendly fabrics, while luxury brand Rachel Riley makes them with a cotton satin lining for children as young as three. In England, only children aged 11 and over will have to wear one in shops. In Scotland, all children aged five and over must cover their faces in shops. Some people have said you should think of your masks like your socks - having a new one every day. That doesn't mean you need to rush out and buy dozens of them, but it's a good idea to perhaps have more than one. That way you can wear a clean one while the other is in the wash. And as for the disposable ones, they are usually sold in large numbers - Boots, for example, has a multipack of 80. That should be more than enough to do the weekly supermarket shop for a few weeks.

"Apple has been told it will not have to pay Ireland â¬13bn (Â£11.6bn) in back taxes after winning an appeal at the European Union's second-highest court. It overturns a 2016 ruling which found the tech giant had been given illegal tax breaks by Dublin. The EU's General Court said it had annulled that decision because there was not enough evidence to show Apple broke EU competition rules. It is a blow for the European Commission, which brought the case. However, it has 14 days to appeal against the decision at the EU's supreme court, the European Court of Justice. ""This case was not about how much tax we pay, but where we are required to pay it,"" Apple said in a statement. ""We're proud to be the largest taxpayer in the world, as we know the important role tax payments play in society."" The Irish government - which had also appealed against the ruling - said it had ""always been clear"" Apple received no special treatment. ""The correct amount of Irish tax was charged... in line with normal Irish taxation rules."" EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, who brought the case, said she would ""study the judgment and reflect on possible next steps"". Dutch MEP Paul Tang called the ruling ""deeply unfair"". ""I suspect that many people in Ireland think... 'Why is there a company that pays 0.05% in taxes?' I pay more taxes than Apple, for that matter. Many people pay more taxes."" Margrethe Vestager has been trying to crack down on tax avoidance The European Commission brought the action after claiming Ireland had allowed Apple to attribute nearly all its EU earnings to an Irish head office that existed only on paper, thereby avoiding paying tax on EU revenues. The commission said this constituted illegal aid given to Apple by the Irish state. Irish EU court appeal on Apple tax ruling But the Irish government argued that Apple should not have to repay the back taxes, deeming that its loss was worth it to make the country an attractive home for large companies. Ireland - which has one of the lowest corporate tax rates in the EU - is Apple's base for Europe, the Middle East and Africa. In Wednesday's ruling, the Luxembourg-based General Court sided with that position, saying there was not enough evidence to show Apple had received illegal state aid or minimised its tax bill. One rather curious feature of this case is that if the ruling had gone the other way, and Ireland had been on the losing side, its ""punishment"" for breaching EU law would have been to receive a large amount of money: taxes the Commission said were owed by Apple. That did not happen, so the ruling - subject to any appeal - means Apple doesn't in law owe the money, so Ireland won't get it. In some quarters of Ireland, there will be relief that an agreement that helped encourage Apple to invest has not been overturned after the event. But the sentiment is far from universal. A Sinn FÃ©in spokesman called it a bad day for the Irish taxpayer that would draw negative attention to the country's international tax reputation. There is growing criticism of so-called sweetheart tax deals across the European Union and the bloc has been trying to clamp down. The ruling will therefore be a blow to Ms Vestager, who has taken aim at a host of big corporations over their allegedly anti-competitive practices. Amazon v EU: Has the online giant met its match? Last year, she lost a case against Starbucks, which was accused of owing â¬30m in back taxes to the Netherlands. Rulings on Ikea and Nike's tax arrangements in that country are due soon. Jason Collins, partner and head of tax at law firm Pinsent Masons, said: ""Apple's victory shows that European courts are unwilling to call beneficial tax regimes state aid, even when designed to attract foreign investment - provided they apply the rules consistently. ""This will be a very welcome outcome for other multinationals who have been watching this case closely."" However, he said Brussels was likely to appeal and EU efforts to tackle tax avoidance would continue. ""We expect the EU to continue applying pressure in this area,"" he said.

"Jen Reid posed with her statue, which appeared on the empty plinth on Wednesday A figure of a Black Lives Matter protester has appeared on the plinth previously occupied by the statue of slave trader Edward Colston. A sculpture of protester Jen Reid was erected early on Wednesday in Bristol city centrewhere the Colston statue was pulled downlast month. Ms Reid had been photographed standing on the empty plinth after the Colston statue was toppled during the march. Mayor Marvin Rees said the statue did not have permission to be installed. In a tweet he said: ""Anything put on the plinth outside of the process we've put in place will have to be removed."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Artist Marc Quinn said the black resin statue, called A Surge of Power, was meant to be a temporary installation to continue the conversation about racism. He said he was inspired to create it after seeing an image of Ms Reid standing on the plinth with her fist raised during the Black Lives Matter protest on 7 June. Mr Quinn then contacted Ms Reid through social media and they worked together on the statue, which was erected shortly before 04:30 BST. How many statues of black people does the UK have? This image of Jen Reid standing on top of the plinth after the Colston statue was pulled down inspired the sculpture ""I think it's something the people of Bristol really appreciate seeing,"" said Ms Reid. ""My husband took the photo on the day of the protests and put it on his social media. He was contacted by Marc Quinn who then contacted myself. ""I was in his studio by the Friday after the protest with 201 cameras surrounding me, taking pictures of me from every conceivable angle. That went into a 3D print and a mould was made."" Ms Reid said the sculpture was important because it helped ""keep the journey towards racial justice and equality moving"". The new statue was unveiled and put on the plinth early on Wednesday She said she had felt an ""overwhelming impulse"" to climb on to the plinth during last month's protest. ""When I was stood there on the plinth, and raised my arm in a Black Power salute, it was totally spontaneous,"" she said. ""I didn't even think about it. It was like an electrical charge of power was running through me. ""This sculpture is about making a stand for my mother, for my daughter, for black people like me."" People in Bristol stopped to take photos of the new statue Mr Quinn said: ""I saw pictures of Jen on the plinth and she spontaneously made this gesture and I thought this is amazing. She's made an extraordinary artwork just by doing that and it needs to be crystalised into an object and put back on to the plinth. ""It had to be in that public realm and I wanted to put it in that charged spot where Edward Colston had been before."" The statue of Edward Colston was pulled from its plinth last month and dragged into the harbourside Mayor of Bristol Marvin Rees, who had previously called the statue of Colston""an affront"", said the new sculpture ""was not requested and permission was not given for it to be installed"". In a statement, he said: ""The future of the plinth and what is installed on it must be decided by the people of Bristol,"" he said. ""This will be critical to building a city that is home to those who are elated at the statue being pulled down, those who sympathise with its removal but are dismayed at how it happened and those who feel that in its removal, they've lost a piece of the Bristol they know and therefore themselves. ""We need change. In leading that change we have to find a pace that brings people with us. There is an African proverb that says if you want to go fast, go alone, if you want to go far, go together."" The council has established acommissionof historians and other experts to research the city's ""true history"". Artist Marc Quinn's previous works include a sculpture entitled Alison Lapper Pregnant, which was put on the fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square On 7 June, protesters used ropes to pull the Colston statue, which had been at the Bristol city centre site since 1895, from its plinth. It was then dragged to the harbourside, where it was thrown into the water at Pero's Bridge - named in honour of enslaved man Pero Jones who lived and died in the city. Bristol City Council later retrieved the statue, which will be displayed in a museum along with placards from the Black Lives Matter protest.

"Neil is known as one of the BBC's most ferocious political interviewers The Andrew Neil Show will disappear from BBC schedules as part of cuts to the corporation's news operation. The political discussion programme had already been off the air during the Covid-19 crisis and will not return. But the BBC said it was talking to Neil about a new BBC One interview show. In total, 520 jobs will go, from a workforce of around 6,000 people. That includes 450 job cuts that wereannounced as part of an Â£80m savings drive in January, andthen put on hold. Meanwhile,The Guardian has announced,externalthat it will cut 180 jobs, including 70 from editorial teams. Most of the changes will take place behind the scenes. The corporation's head of news, Fran Unsworth, said the BBC would concentrate on fewer stories, with journalists pooled in centralised teams, rather than working for specific programmes. The BBC News Channel and BBC World will continue to share some output in the mornings and evenings, as they have done during the Covid-19 crisis, although they will remain separate channels. Radio 4 programme In Business will close, as will the Business Live page on the BBC News Website, while bespoke business news bulletins on the BBC News channel will be reduced. On BBC World Service, World Update and The World This Week will end, while daily current affairs show Newsday will shorten in length. The BBC also said it would close most of its social accounts to focus on core services like@bbcnews,external,@bbcworld,externaland@bbcbreaking,external. One of Neil's former programmes, lunchtime TV show Politics Live, will return four days a week after being rested during the pandemic. More than 100 MPs and peers recently wrote to the BBC, arguing that axing it permanently would ""seriously harm the ability of the BBC to scrutinise and explain"" politics. The BBC says it will have fewer reporters overall, but that a new commissioning system (which was partly implemented during the Covid-19 crisis) will make sure coverage is better co-ordinated. More interviews will be conducted by Skype, Zoom and other video technologies, meaning there's less reliance on satellite trucks and radio cars. A new original journalism team will also be created, incorporating several staff from the Victoria Derbyshire show, to pursue under-reported and exclusive stories. There will also be a greater focus on digital storytelling. The coronavirus pandemic means the BBC must save a further Â£125m this year Unsworth said Covid-19 had ""changed all of our lives"" and had also ""led us to re-evaluate exactly how we operate as an organisation"". She said: ""Our operation has been underpinned by the principles we set out earlier this year - fewer stories, more targeted and with more impact. For BBC News to thrive, and for us to continue to serve all our audiences, we have to change."" After the announcement,the corporation revealed,externalthat legal correspondent Clive Coleman has decided to leave the BBC at the end of the year. The BBC announced in 2016 that it needed to save Â£800m, with around Â£80m of that figure coming from News. Just over Â£40m - around half of the savings required - has been found over the past four years. In January, the corporation announced plans to close 450 jobs, as well as programmes like BBC Two's highly-regarded Victoria Derbyshire show. The Derbyshire show's award-winning investigations included an expose on sexual abuse in football The cuts were later postponedas the newsroom faced the demands of covering the coronavirus pandemic. At the same time, the BBC delayed a decision to end free TV licences for the over-75s. That contributed to a further budget shortfall, meaning that the number of proposed job losses in news has increased by 70 posts. A separate decision to cut 450 jobs in the BBC's regional newsroomswas announced earlier this month. Neil has been one of the BBC's top political broadcasters over the past two decades on shows like This Week and Daily Politics. The Andrew Neil Show began in autumn 2019 in the run-up to the general election and the UK's departure from the European Union. It included interviews with most party leaders, but Prime Minister Boris Johnson did not appear - leading the host tocontroversially deliver an on-air ultimatum. Announcing the latest cuts, the BBC said: ""We remain committed to Andrew Neil's in-depth interviews (as well as the Budget, US Election and other Specials). ""The Andrew Neil Show will not be returning but we're in discussions about a new interview series on BBC One."" Neil had previously told the Radio Times he feared he would become ""surplus to requirements"" as the BBC made cutbacks. Today we have fresh details on the radical experiment that BBC News announced in January. Two big things have changed because of coronavirus. It has accentuated the BBC's financial strain, and shown a different way of working is possible. Both help account for the rise in likely redundancies. The fact that Politics Live will come back for four days a week will appease many in Westminster - but the loss of The Andrew Neil Show will have the opposite effect. That show was originally commissioned because of an intervention by Tony Hall, but he is leaving as director general in September. The BBC says Neil's in-depth interviews are still key to its coverage, and they would like to find a slot on BBC One for those interviews. There is no one correct way to conduct interviews. The right approach depends on the interviewer, the interviewee, and the context. But in one particular style - forensic, unrelenting scrutiny and interrogation of those in power - Neil is the best in the business. His talks with the BBC are far from resolved. Two fresh proposals have run aground. He will no longer do Politics Live - but has been approached by other broadcasters. Broadcasting union Bectu said it would hold BBC management to account and seek to avoid compulsory redundancies. ""BBC News is one of the most trusted brands at home and abroad. In an era of fake news and during an unprecedented health crisis this trust in a public service broadcaster is critical,"" said Bectu head, Philippa Childs. ""The government needs to take back responsibility for free licence fees for the over-75s, providing precious resources that would allow BBC News to continue to provide its world-leading range of news broadcasting.""

An investigation into a coronavirus-hit farm in Herefordshire has now been widened to include others in England and Scotland. The total number of positive coronavirus cases linked to the outbreak at AS Green & Co in Mathon now stands at 93, Public Health England (PHE) said. In an update on Wednesday evening, PHE said 76 workers who travelled on to other farms in England came to the UK on the same flight as the Herefordshire farm workers. It added that these 76 people have already been offered testing and no further cases have been identified to date. A further 63 workers who travelled on to Scottish farms were on the same flight. PHE said it has notified public health authorities in Scotland so this groupcan be ""followed-up appropriately"". A group of workers who travelled to the UK by private coach, including some of those who went on to work at AS Green and Co, are also being followed up, it added. Another worker fled the farm, despite being told not to. PHE said the agency that employed the worker (who tested negative for the virus) is in contact with them and has been advised they are self-isolating.Three other workers who fled the farm earlier have been traced. Karen Wright, director of Public Health for Herefordshire, said as testing of workers at the farm continues, officials expect to see the number of cases rise over the coming days ""before social distancing and infection prevention measures start to take effect"". She added that workers have been asked to remain on site and self-isolate to ""reduce risk of spread within the workforce and into the wider community"", and food and essential supplies were being delivered to the farm during this time. She said she knows local residents are concerned, but added the risk to the general public ""remains low"" The group said the Turkish villagers seemed seemed happy to host them Travel plans have been disrupted, borders have been closed and venues of all kinds have been shut during the pandemic. This posed a perfect storm of problems for a group of young musicians, whose road trip across Asia was brought to a standstill earlier this year.

One member of the four-piece group, Mirjam Ellenbrok, told the BBC they got stuck in the village after the borders suddenly closed along their route. The group has made the most of their time, however, learning from the locals how to cook village specialities and prepare yogurt from cow's milk, while gardening in the lush surroundings. Read the full storyto see how the group whiled away the time in the mountain village. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Official Chinese media say that an undisclosed number of customers and delivery personnel have been told to self-isolate in southeastern China after Covid-19 was detected on shrimp containers imported from Ecuador. According to the official CGTN broadcaster, Covid-19 was detected on imported samples in the city of Pingxiang in Jiangxi province. The local government says that âno abnormal situation has been found in the city so farâ to suggest a potential localised outbreak. This is the second time this week that samples of seafood products have tested positive from the South American country. On Monday, the official China Daily said that seafood from three Ecuadorian companies were being pulled from shelves after six samples from inside shipping containers and the outer packaging of shrimp tested positive at customs. Many local governments and online retailers quickly issued suspension orders on these products and said that they were carrying out tests. In recent weeks, Chinese consumers have been nervous about eating seafood, after chopping boards used for imported salmon tested positive at a wholesale market in Beijing. It is believed this led to 335 people being infected across the capital city, and led to Beijing implementing a strict lockdown and aggressive testing procedures. A UK bingo chain has announced the permanent closure of 26 of its halls, putting 573 jobs at risk. Buzz Bingo, which is based in Nottingham, said it had taken the decision due to an ""unsustainable operating environment for the foreseeable future"". Its remaining 91 halls will continue to trade when they reopen from 6 August. Chief executive Chris Matthews said a restructure would ensure those clubs were able to adapt to new coronavirus safety measures and lower customer numbers. Buzz Bingo had to close its sites on 21 March due to the UK government lockdown and furloughed the majority of its staff. The company, which employs about 3,400 people, said it would ""take time"" for footfall at sites to reach pre-virus levels due to social distancing measures and weaker customer confidence.

Sweden's coronavirus containment strategy has been widely criticised Large parts of Swedenâs population are still susceptible to the coronavirus, the countryâs health authorities have said, casting further doubt on the so-called herd immunity strategy. Herd immunity happens when a large proportion of a population develops immunity to a contagious disease, be it through community transmission or vaccination. Sweden has seen far more coronavirus cases than any of its Nordic neighbours, recording 76,492 infections and 5,572 deaths to date,a Johns Hopkins University tally says,external. Sweden did not pursue a full lockdown, instead relying on voluntary social distancing and limited restrictions, such as the banning of large gatherings. The countryâs top epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, has previously expressed hope that herd immunity may be a useful by-product of the strategy, though not its aim. But on Tuesday a senior Swedish health official, Karin Tegmark Wisell, said large parts of Swedenâs population âhavenât been infectedâ by the coronavirus, meaning they are still susceptible. Earlier this month,a study from Spain raised questions about the feasibility of herd immunityas a way of tackling the coronavirus pandemic. Sir Ed Davey is one of two contenders for the leadership of the Liberal Democrat party Acting Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey has said an independent inquiry into the handling of coronavirus in the UK âcanât come soon enough for bereaved families.â Sir Ed said he had called for the inquiry at Prime Ministerâs Questions on Wednesday âbecause thereâs been tens of thousands of deathsâ and the bereaved families âneed to have some answersâ. Earlier todayPrime Minister Boris Johnson committed to ""an independent inquiryinto what happened"" during the UK coronavirus pandemic sometime ""in the future"". Mr Davey said he had since written to the prime minister asking him to âconfirm that it should be an inquiry under the Inquiries Act 2005,â which the acting leader claims would give it âreal teethâ¦ to get to the bottom of the issue"". âWeâve got to get on with it,"" he told the BBC. There have been more than 290,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 45,000 people have died, government figures show. Both case numbers and the death toll has been falling steadily, but concern remains over possible localised spikes in infection. Take a look atthe latest data on confirmed cases in your area. As coronavirus cases continue to climb, particularly in southern US states like Texas and Florida, many school districts are considering a combination of online and in-person learning - though the White House has continued to push for complete reopenings. A newPolitico/Morning Consult poll,externalhas found that a majority of voters do not think schools and daycare should fully open, in-person, this autumn. The poll also found that 65% of voters disagree with President Trump's threat to cut funding for schools that refuse to reopen. Another poll fromNavigator Research,externalon Wednesday said the number of parents who oppose reopening schools has jumped from 31% at the start of June to 51% as of 15 July. On Tuesday,an Axios/Ipsos poll,externalalso reported most parents, including a slim majority of Republicans, say it is risky to reopen schools. Now, a post to make you hungry if you've skipped lunch and are still a while away from dinner. Nando's, Pret A Manger and McDonald's are among the UK food chains to promise reductions in their prices after the chancellor ordered a temporary VAT cut from 20% to 5%. As a reminder, VAT is the tax you pay on everyday goods and services and is usually included in the price most consumers see. Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced the Â£4bn cut in VAT - which will stay in place until 12 January 2021- to help firms recover in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic and get consumers spending. The Treasury estimates households could save Â£160 a year on average, but not all companies will pass on the benefit. Many firms are expected to use the windfall to shore up finances hit by the lockdown rather than cut prices for customers. You can read more here. Governor Kevin Stitt Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt has announced he has tested positive for Covid-19. He is the first governor to publicly announce a virus diagnosis so far, US media report. ""I feel fine, I felt a little bit achy yesterday,"" the Republican governor told reporters. He said is isolating from his family - who have tested negative - and working from home. Stitt attended President Trump's controversialrally in Tulsa, Oklahoma,on 20 June, which local health officials have said was likely to have contributed to the city's recent spike in Covid-19 cases. The governor also told reporters he does not plan to make masks mandatory across the state. ""I'm so proud of how we've handled it this far,"" he said of the state's response to the pandemic. Shortly after the announcement, the Oklahoma Department of Health reported 1,075 additional cases - a new single-day record for the state,according to KOCO News,external. Three people who left a coronavirus-hit farm in England's West Midlands have now been traced,a council has said. Vegetable producers A S Green and Co in Mathon, Herefordshire,went into lockdown after testsshowed 74 people had tested positive for Covid-19. Of the three workers who left against advice, one had tested positive. They are all now self-isolating. A joint statement released on Wednesday from Herefordshire Council and Public Health Midlands said: ""Three workers (one of whom tested positive) left the farm despite being asked to remain on site and isolate. ""All three of these individuals have been reached through the agency that secured their employment, and all have confirmed they are self-isolating."" About 200 workers are said to be in quarantine at the site's live-in accommodation. The farm employs a mix of seasonal workers from the UK and abroad. Starbucks and Walmart on Wednesday announced new mask requirements in all  US stores amid Covid-19 surges in a number of regions across the country. Starbucks says facial coverings will be required for patrons and staff in all its cafes as of 15 July. The coffee retailer says it will also limit the number of customers allowed inside to maintain social distancing. Retail giant Walmart will enact a similar policy in its more than 5,000 stores by 20 July, and noted many stores were in regions already under government mandates regarding facial coverings. The company also said employees would receive special training to assist customers. ""We know it may not be possible for everyone to wear a face covering,"" company officials said. ""Our associates will be trained on those exceptions to help reduce friction for the shopper and make the process as easy as possible for everyone."" UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak has defended his job retention bonus scheme after MPs questioned its value for money. The policy - which was announced last week - will see the government pay employers Â£1,000 for every furloughed worker they retain past January. MPs on the Commons Treasury Committee described the scheme as ""badly-timed and poorly-targeted"". But Sunak said he believed it would ""serve as a significant incentive"" to preserve jobs amid the pandemic. Labour's Angela Eagle cautioned that scheme risked spending taxpayers' money for no benefit. ""Surely you could have had less deadweight if you'd have focused support on different sectors, why didn't you do that?"" she asked. But Sunak insisted the scheme ""will and can make a difference"". Kai Wei says people in Beijing have adopted a ""keep calm and carry on"" attitude As countries far and wide cautiously emerge from lockdowns, some places are regrettably heading back into them. From Europe to Australia, Asia to the US, restrictions are being reimposed in areas where coronavirus infections are on the rise again. The Chinese capital, Beijing, was among those places. We spoke to Kai Wei, a 29-year-old resident of the city, who gave us her guide to surviving a second lockdown. Kai's advice was to keep a happiness balance sheet, trying every means to stay entertained and sane. ""Live as normally as possible. And always wear a mask when you can go out!"" Read our pieceto see what other people living under second lockdowns have advised. From today, holidaymakers can take direct flights to Greece from the UK. So which other countries can you now visit and what do you need to do when you return? Passengers entering the UK from dozens of countries no longer have to quarantine for two weeks thanks to a relaxation of the government's travel quarantine rules on Friday. More than 50 countries - including many popular holiday spots - now pose ''a reduced risk'' from coronavirus, the government says. WalesandNorthern Irelandhave introduced quarantine exemptions for the same countries as England. Scotland is also allowing exemptions, although unlike the other nationsdoes not exempt travellers from Spain, because of concerns about their rate of coronavirus. You can read more here. Another 85 people have died in UK hospitals, care homes and the community after testing positive for coronavirus, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) says. It brings UK deaths to 45,053 under that measure, but the figures do not include all deaths involving Covid-19 across the UK, which are thought to have passed 55,500. The DHSC also said that in the 24-hours up to 09:00 BST on Wednesday, there had been a further 538 lab-confirmed UK cases. Overall, a total of 291,911 cases have been confirmed. Iran has recorded more than 260,000 coronavirus infections Iran has said 140 of its health workers have died with Covid-19 since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. ""We all owe them our lives and to honour them, we must observe health protocols,â said Sima Sadat Lari, an Iranian health ministry official. The country has seen a rapid surge in the number of coronavirus cases recently, after relaxing its lockdown restrictions in mid-April. So far, Iran has recorded 264,561 infections and 13,410 deaths since the start of the pandemic,according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University,external. Health officials have suggested the renewed surge in new infections could be attributed to more testing, and they have said people were ignoring social-distancing rules. On Wednesday Iranian President Hassan Rohani urged people to respect health regulations, in particular social distancing. ""We ask the people to avoid all gatherings and to adapt the way of life to the current situation,â President Hassan Rohani said at a cabinet meeting. Read BBC Reality Checkâs latest analysison the Covid-19 situation in Iran. Mike Pompeo has taken a hardline against China during the pandemic The World Health Organizationâs (WHO) inquiry into the coronavirus pandemic will be a âcompletely white-washed investigationâ, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said, as he lashed out at China. Mr Pompeo accused China of failing to disclose information about the coronavirus when the first cases were detected in the city of Wuhan last year. That failure, Mr Pompeo said, had âkilled over 100,000 Americans and âcost the global economy trillions and trillions of dollarsâ. âAnd now it is allowing the World Health Organization to go in to conduct what I am confident will be a completely, a completely white-washed investigation,â Mr Pompeo said at a news conference on Wednesday. Mr Pompeo appears to be referring to an independent inquiry into the global response to the coronavirus pandemic, launched by the WHO earlier this month. Chaired by two former world leaders, the panel will be tasked with analysing responses to the pandemic by member states and the WHO itself. The panel will not, however, look into the origin of the coronavirus, as Mr Pompeo and other world leaders had demanded. Throughout the pandemic, the Trump administration has implicated the WHO in an alleged cover-up by the Chinese in the early stages of the pandemic.

Lessons will be able to resume from 27 July, the first minister has told the Senedd. Conservative member of the Senedd (MS) for Clwyd Darren Millar said learners and instructors had been ""crying out"" for a date but would undoubtedly be ""disappointed and frustrated"" that they have got to wait a further two weeks for lessons and even longer for tests. âLike with everything the Welsh Government announces with regards coming out of lockdown, there is always an unnecessary time lapse.â Two more people have died from coronavirus in Wales. According to today's report from Public Health Wales, there have been two more reported deaths and 18 new cases, bringing the total number of deaths to 1,545. There have been 16,854 confirmed cases of coronavirus in Wales. Credit cards spending
dropped by nearly halfat the start of lockdown as people played safe with
their finances and shunned big purchases. A
total of Â£8.7bn was spent on credit cards in the first full month of lockdown
in April, half the level of April last year, UK Finance said. The
banking trade body said this was the lowest level of spending seen since the
last economic downturn. The
cancellation of holiday plans is one likely reason for the fall. There are no current plans to ban smoking outside pubs, Mr Gething says. He said there had been no change to government plans on smoking regulations. He added: âThe more immediate point is the ban on smoking in playgrounds, school grounds, and hospitals, which I think enjoys widespread support across the public."" He said any future proposals are ones for âanother termâ of a Welsh Government.  Not all care workers visiting people's homes will be routinely tested for coronavirus, the health minister says. There have been calls to test all domiciliary carers who look after people in their own homes, regardless of whether they have symptoms, as happens with staff in care homes. Domciliary carers are only tested when they have symptoms. Vaughan Gething said some would receive anitbody tests, which show if people have had the disease, as part of a new surveillance plan. âThe evidence that we have had and published today doesn't support testing the whole sector as the right approach,â he said. âIt does underpin though, as I've said, everyone who has symptoms should get a test and self-isolate. âIt also underpins actually the importance of a move from the UK government on statutory sick pay or supportive pay where people are advised by the contact tracing service to self-isolate as they have in Germany. Speaking ahead of his press conference, opposition parties called for domiciliary carers to receive more testing. Conservative shadow social care minister Janet Finch Saunders said the service had âgone under the radarâ. âIf you work in domiciliary care, social care, district nurse, occupational therapy, physiotherapy â anybody going to somebodyâs home receiving care in the community, I think you should be tested,â she said. Age Cymruâs chief executive Victoria Lloyd said: âWe have been clear about the need for adequate and practical access to fast testing for all social care staff to support infection control measures. ""As such we would support a programme of regular testing for domiciliary care staff."" The difficulties that England are experiencing in making face masks compulsory in different settings showed that it ""isnât a
straightforward question,"" according to Vaughan Gething. The health minister said there were issues with ""enforceability"" and with ""questioning people"" who arenât wearing masks. Mr Gething confirmed it was the Welsh Governmentâs position not to make the wearing of face masks in
shops mandatory. First Minister Mark Drakeford said people were advised to wear face
coverings in crowded areas but has resisted calls to enforce people to do so. Mr Gething
said that the Welsh Government was continuing to take advice from the chief medical officer and following global scientific evidence regarding face
coverings. âIf that
evidence was to change, we would happily consider changing our position,â he
said. âFace
coverings are the last tier of measures to take, in the sense of protecting all
of us. It still starts by following that social-distancing guidance. Itâs much
more important than wearing a face covering. ""A face
covering wonât protect you if youâre bumping along with other people instead of
observing social distancing.â He also said the advice on face coverings may change if the government had to
enforce a local lockdown as has happened in Leicester and Blackburn.  You should still work from home if you can and avoid using
public transport where possible, the Welsh Government has said. It tweeted its latest workplace guidelines and said employers
must do all they can to keep 2 metres distance and protect those who need to
return to the workplace.  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Wearing a face covering could be a mandatory part of any future local lockdown, according to the first minister. Face coverings will be mandatory on public transport in Wales from 27 July. Mark Drakeford said he was also considering the use of face masks in supermarkets and crowded tourist destinations in Wales. Speaking at first minister's questions, Mr Drakeford said that they were keeping everything ""under review"". ""I've asked for further advice for example, on suggestions that supermarkets in tourist destinations have been crowded over this last weekend as populations in those areas increase. ""Mandatory use of face coverings as part of a local lockdown, should that become necessary, will certainly be part of a potential repertoire here in Wales. ""And if the prevalence of coronavirus in Wales were to rise, our advice would be revisited. ""In the meantime, the position in Wales is anybody going into a shop who wishes to wear a face mask is absolutely entitled to do so. ""Our advice is that if it is crowded you should wear one."" But he said that for now the advice from Wales' Chief Medical Officer ""has not changed. They have a marginal utility, but they also have identifiable downsides."" Since mid June all care staff have been tested for coronavirus on a weekly basis which has shown the prevalence of the virus in care homes to be low, said the health minister. The most recent figures show there have been a total of 28,763 tests on care home residents. This is 706 more than the week before but 95.6% of tests proved negative - and only three residents tested positive in the last week. Figures show 60,464 staff had been tested too; 98% of tests were negative. Vaughan Gething said low case numbers was ""very good news"" but low prevalence of the disease was likely to generate a higher rate of false positives. He said that this had implications for the use of antigen tests as a screening tool and for those individuals who may be asked to self isolate. The Welsh Government would continue to test care home staff on a weekly basis for a further four weeks. ""If low prevalence trends continue during this period we will move to a fortnightly regime for antigen testing. Alongside this, we will roll out a surveillance programme of antibody testing for social care and domiciliary staff"", he added. The new coronavirus testing strategy will ensure  immediate action is taken if new cases are identified in communities, the health minister has promised. This would include using mobile testing units to test all care home staff and residents, Vaughan Gething said. He said if care homes were identified as higher risk - for example because of local outbreaks - bespoke testing regimes would be implemented. ""This risk-based approach will also apply to other settings and localities, enabling local teams to use testing as part of a wider approach to surveillance and outbreak control"". Health Minister Vaughan Gething has outlined the Welsh Government's new coronavirus testing strategy. Speaking at the daily coronavirus news briefing, he said the strategy sets out ""why, where and how we will test to achieve clear outcomes"". Mr Gething said the Welsh Government's testing priorities for the coming weeks and months would be:  He said: ""An enormous amount has been achieved over the past few months and I would like to thank everyone for their contribution. But, we now need to prepare ourselves for this next phase â and for what might be a difficult winter"". Walesâ new coronavirus
  testing strategy has been published by the health minister. Vaughan Gething  said the strategy focused on four main areas:  There are
  currently two different forms of testing in Wales; the antigen virus
  detection test that shows if someone currently has the virus, and the
  antibody test which is used to determine whether a person has been
  previously infected. He said the weekly testing programme for care homes would continue for
  another four weeks, with the data on prevalence rates closely monitored. If
  prevalence rates remained at the current low levels then the testing cycle would move fortnightly. Mr Gething, said: âWe now have a national testing infrastructure that means
  anyone who needs a test can access one. This enables our contact tracing
  system to help control the transmission of the disease as lockdown measures
  are eased. âOur NHS Wales Test, Trace, Protect service is
  fundamental to helping us to find a way to live with the disease until a
  vaccine or treatment is available."" The Welsh Government's daily coronavirus briefing is due to start at 12:30 BST.

"Seventeen-year-old women are most likely to have been put on furlough during the coronavirus crisis, official data shows. Some 61% of jobs done by these young women had wages paid by the state, HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) said. Young men of the same age were also more likely than not to have been furloughed, hitting 58% of their jobs. Men aged in their 40s and women aged 41 to 58 were least likely to have been put on the scheme. Anne Willmot, age campaign director at Business in the Community, said: ""Young people are being locked out of employment at the start of their careers - a key time for them to gain experience, learning and development in the workplace."" More than nine million workers who are unable to do their job because of the coronavirus outbreak have had their wages paid by the government. What happens when the furlough scheme ends? The furlough scheme was designed to help people put on leave because of the outbreak, and prevent mass redundancies. Firms start paying towards the scheme from August. It will close in October. Detaileddata has been published by HMRC,externalwhich shows where the scheme was used until the end of June, by which point it had cost the Treasury Â£26.5bn. People working for smaller companies are more likely to have been furloughed than those employed by bigger businesses. Some 57% of jobs at businesses with between five and nine employees had been furloughed, compared with 19% at companies with 250 or more employees. A handful of larger companies have beenrepaying furlough moneyclaimed from the Treasury. By sector, those working in accommodation and food services had the highest proportion of employers furloughing at least some staff (87%) and the highest proportion of total employments furloughed at 73%. The local authority with the highest proportion of jobs furloughed was South Lakeland at 40% and the lowest was Boston in Lincolnshire at 20%. Three-quarters of those eligible for support grants to help the self-employed through the coronavirus crisis had made a claim by the end of June,further data from HMRC shows,external. What help are self-employed getting from government? Women were less likely to have made a claim, with 70% having done so, compared to 78% of men who were eligible and had claimed a grant. The amount paid depends on previous income from their trade, and the figures show that the average claim for women was also lower, at Â£2,300, compared to the average claim for men of Â£3,200. The highest proportion of claims by profession was in the construction sector. Have you been affected by the issues raised in this story?

"Credit cards spending dropped by nearly half at the start of lockdown as people played safe with their finances and shunned big purchases. A total of Â£8.7bn was spent on credit cards in the first full month of lockdown in April, half the level of April last year, UK Finance said. The banking trade body said this was the lowest level of spending seen since the last economic downturn. The cancellation of holiday plans is one likely reason for the fall. Consumers often use credit cards to pay for summer getaways or major purchases such as household appliances, owing to the extra protection available if something goes wrong. Many people uncertain about the coronavirus effect on their jobs and finances would have put off buying these items, UK Finance said. The temporary closure of shops and travel restrictions would also have meant many people put these buying decisions on hold. Clothing and games push up UK shop prices Credit card freeze extended for three months Some pre-paid holidays or flights were refunded into credit card accounts after being cancelled, and consumers adopted a safety-first approach to their credit card spending similar to that seen following the banking crisis of a decade ago. As a result, outstanding balances on credit cards fell by almost Â£4.7bn in April 2020, the largest monthly fall in over a decade, as many people opted to make repayments rather than spend on their credit cards, UK Finance said. Separate data from the Bank of England has also shown this repayment trend. Eric Leenders, from UK Finance, said: ""The Covid-19 crisis has significantly changed how, where and when people spend their money."" With many shops closed in April, the proportion of card spending that was completed online hit a record level. A third of credit and debit card spending was made over the internet, according to the UK Finance figures. The picture for debit cards is more complex. With shops closed, the use of these cards was down 5.1% in April compared with the same month a year ago. Contactless payments saw a significant drop, as many people were working from home and making fewer occasional purchases, as well as commuting less. However, with the limit on contactless payments having risen from Â£30 to Â£45 and some shops refusing cash, the average purchase using this technology rose above Â£10 for the first time.

"Ireland wants to demonstrate to multinational investors that the country is a safe and predictable place to do business An EU court is hearing appeals against a decision to order Ireland to recover Â£11.5bn of unpaid taxes from Apple. In 2016, the European Commission found an agreement between Dublin and the technology giant was against EU law. It said the Irish government allowed Apple to attribute nearly all its EU sales earnings to an Irish head office that existed only on paper, thereby avoiding paying tax on EU revenues. Both the Republic of Ireland and Apple are appealing against the ruling. By John Campbell, BBC News NI Economics and Business Editor Why would any government want to turn down a â¬14bn tax windfall? For Ireland, the motivation is twofold: First there is the desire to disprove claims that it acts, or has acted, as a tax haven. The country has faced increasing criticism of its corporate tax policies, with the American economist Gabriel Zucman leading the charge. He has accused Ireland of being ""the world's number one tax haven"". Secondly, Ireland wants to demonstrate to multinational investors that the country is a safe and predictable place to do business. Apple's lawyer Daniel Beard told the court the order issued by the European Commission three years ago ""defied reality and common sense"". ""The activities of these two branches in Ireland simply could not be responsible for generating almost all of Apple's profits outside the Americas"", he added. The European Commission argued Ireland allowed Apple to reduce substantially its tax bill in a way that gave the technology giant a selective advantage over other companies located in Ireland, said Laura Treacy, a Brussels-based partner at Irish law firm McCann FitzGerald. ""The two companies in question were really the revenue generating companies for all of Europe. They happened to be located in Ireland,"" Ms Treacy told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Why is Ireland refusing billions? Ireland forced to collect 13bn euro tax bill ""They were established in Ireland, but importantly, they were non-tax resident in Ireland and, as a result, they were not required to pay income or corporate tax on their worldwide profits but rather only on the profits that were attributable to the Irish operations."" The iPhone has been one of Apple's most successful products The Irish state argues the EC has misunderstood the Irish tax rules and Irish tax arrangements, she said. ""Where the commission says a lot of the profits were being transferred to head offices which, according to the commission, had no employees and no staff, and carried on very little substance,"" she said. ""Ireland and Apple are saying no actually, quite serious decision making was taking place in these head office entities,"" she added. ""And it was correct to allocate the vast proportions of the profits to the head offices, leaving only smaller amounts in Ireland because they are saying only routine tax decisions were taking place in Ireland."" Ms Treacy said both Apple and Ireland argue that one of the commission's key points is incorrect and does not form part of state aid law, but is instead ""a kind of novel rule"" introduced by the commission. Why is Ireland refusing billions? Apple pays disputed Irish tax bill Should tech companies be paying more tax?

"The world is ill-prepared for the global crash in children being born which is set to have a ""jaw-dropping"" impact on societies, say researchers. Falling fertility rates mean nearly every country could have shrinking populations by the end of the century. And 23 nations - including Spain and Japan - are expected to see their populations halve by 2100. Countries will also age dramatically, with as many people turning 80 as there are being born. The fertility rate - the average number of children a woman gives birth to - is falling. If the number falls below approximately 2.1, then the size of the population starts to fall. In 1950, women were having an average of 4.7 children in their lifetime. Researchers at the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation showed the global fertility rate nearly halved to 2.4 in 2017 - and their study,published in the Lancet,external, projects it will fall below 1.7 by 2100. As a result, the researchers expect the number of people on the planet to peak at 9.7 billion around 2064, before falling down to 8.8 billion by the end of the century. ""That's a pretty big thing; most of the world is transitioning into natural population decline,"" researcher Prof Christopher Murray told the BBC. ""I think it's incredibly hard to think this through and recognise how big a thing this is; it's extraordinary, we'll have to reorganise societies."" It has nothing to do with sperm counts or the usual things that come to mind when discussing fertility. Instead it is being driven by more women in education and work, as well as greater access to contraception, leading to women choosing to have fewer children. In many ways, falling fertility rates are a success story. Japan's population is projected to fall from a peak of 128 million in 2017 to less than 53 million by the end of the century. Italy is expected to see an equally dramatic population crash from 61 million to 28 million over the same timeframe. They are two of 23 countries - which also include Spain, Portugal, Thailand and South Korea - expected to see their population more than halve. ""That is jaw-dropping,"" Prof Christopher Murray told me. China, currently the most populous nation in the world, is expected to peak at 1.4 billion in four years' time before nearly halving to 732 million by 2100. India will take its place. The UK is predicted to peak at 75 million in 2063, and fall to 71 million by 2100. However, this will be a truly global issue, with 183 out of 195 countries having a fertility rate below the replacement level. You might think this is great for the environment. A smaller population would reduce carbon emissions as well as deforestation for farmland. ""That would be true except for the inverted age structure (more old people than young people) and all the uniformly negative consequences of an inverted age structure,"" says Prof Murray. The world faces a shift from young to old The study projects: The number of under-fives will fall from 681 million in 2017 to 401 million in 2100. The number of over 80-year-olds will soar from 141 million in 2017 to 866 million in 2100. Prof Murray adds: ""It will create enormous social change. It makes me worried because I have an eight-year-old daughter and I wonder what the world will be like."" Who pays tax in a massively aged world? Who pays for healthcare for the elderly? Who looks after the elderly? Will people still be able to retire from work? ""We need a soft landing,"" argues Prof Murray. Countries, including the UK, have used migration to boost their population and compensate for falling fertility rates. However, this stops being the answer once nearly every country's population is shrinking. ""We will go from the period where it's a choice to open borders, or not, to frank competition for migrants, as there won't be enough,"" argues Prof Murray. Some countries have tried policies such as enhanced maternity and paternity leave, free childcare, financial incentives and extra employment rights, but there is no clear answer. Sweden has dragged its fertility rate up from 1.7 to 1.9, but other countries that have put significant effort into tackling the ""baby bust"" have struggled. Singapore still has a fertility rate of around 1.3. Prof Murray says: ""I find people laugh it off; they can't imagine it could be true, they think women will just decide to have more kids. ""If you can't [find a solution] then eventually the species disappears, but that's a few centuries away."" How do countries fight falling birth rates? The researchers warn against undoing the progress on women's education and access to contraception. Prof Stein Emil Vollset said: ""Responding to population decline is likely to become an overriding policy concern in many nations, but must not compromise efforts to enhance women's reproductive health or progress on women's rights."" The population of sub-Saharan Africa is expected to treble in size to more than three billion people by 2100. And the study says Nigeria will become the world's second biggest country, with a population of 791 million. Prof Murray says: ""We will have many more people of African descent in many more countries as we go through this. ""Global recognition of the challenges around racism are going to be all the more critical if there are large numbers of people of African descent in many countries."" You might think the number should be 2.0 - two parents have two children, so the population stays the same size. But even with the best healthcare, not all children survive to adulthood. Also, babies are ever so slightly more likely to be male. It means the replacement figure is 2.1 in developed countries. Nations with higher childhood mortality also need a higher fertility rate. Prof Ibrahim Abubakar, University College London (UCL), said: ""If these predictions are even half accurate, migration will become a necessity for all nations and not an option. ""To be successful we need a fundamental rethink of global politics. ""The distribution of working-age populations will be crucial to whether humanity prospers or withers.""

"This video can not be played Hairdressers, pubs, cinemas, tourist attractions and places of worship have reopened Scotland has begun its most significant relaxation of coronavirus measures since the country went into lockdown in March. Hairdressers and barbers, bars and restaurants, cinemas, tourist attractions, places of worship and childcare settings can now all reopen. Nicola Sturgeon said it is ""the biggest step so far"" in exiting lockdown. But she warned she would ""not hesitate"" to close bars and restaurants again if the coronavirus starts to spread. The reopening of indoor spaces requires anti-virus precautions to be in place andall customers will be asked to provide their name and a phone number, as part of the NHS Test and Protect scheme. The first minister warned it was now more important than ever to stick to public health measures. Nicola Sturgeon was blunt when she said sticking to public health measures was now more important than ever She said that by some margin these are the highest-risk changes to date as they include indoor activity where the risk of spread is significantly higher than outdoors, Speaking at the daily briefing, she added: ""I have to say I am even more nervous about today's changes than I have been about earlier changes. ""It is vital, more vital than it has been at any stage of this crisis so far, that all of us stick rigidly to the rules and guidance on how to behave in these different settings."" The first minister said she would not hesitate to reverse changes if the virus gets out of control again. She said: ""If these rules are not respected and the virus spreads again then I am afraid I am going to be standing here in a few weeks' time saying we're shutting pubs and restaurants again."" Many businesses are opening their doors for the first time since March, but not all are planning to do so right away. Barbers across have been serving people since midnight as part of the lockdown restrictions easing further Tony Mann opened his barber shop in Giffnock just after midnight, and plans to cut hair for the entire day. He told the BBC: ""For the next 24 hours, I'm going to stand here and do what I do best."" Mr Mann, who first opened his barbers in 2014, said the midnight opening was a way of offering loyal customers a haircut as soon as possible. He said it had been stressful preparing his shop to be ""Covid-secure"", but it was very important to do so. Scottish Labour Leader Richard Leonard getting a trim at Scrimshaws and Co salon in Glasgow Paul Russell said messages of support from his bar's regulars during the lockdown was a lifeline for him and his staff In Dundee city centre, Paul Russell, licensee of the Bank Bar, said he was delighted to be back serving regulars in the pub after a ""long three months"". He said: ""At one point we did think we would not be here but obviously we're glad to be back. ""We've been doing takeaway food to keep our hand in and it's been quite successful. ""Now we've put a lot of things in place for the safety of not just the staff but the customers as well."" The Bank Bar has been providing takeaway food during the lockdown Two of the first customers to be served at The Scotsman's Lounge pub in Edinburgh Neil Douglas is offering the same food but the dining experience will be very different Hand sanitiser, plastic screens and passing places on the way to the toilet, are among the measures in place to keep people safe at Ardnamurchan restaurant in Glasgow. These protections have allowed the business to relax the 2m rule and increase their capacity to become more financially viable. Director Neil Douglas, said: ""We have installed contactless taps and flushes in the toilet and weekly deep cleans. Our staff are organised into teams and we have turned our business model on its head. ""However, the end product is still langoustines from Ardnamurchan and venison straight off the estate, so fundamentally the food on the plate is still the same"". The dining experience will be different - paper disposable menus, no salt and pepper on tables and sealed, pre-packaged cutlery. Ardnamurchan is unrecognisable with its screens but clever distancing measures mean it has retained an 80% capacity But just because bars and restaurants can open does not mean they will. Colin Wilkinson, managing director of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association, said the hospitality sector would be struggling for a long time. He said: ""About a third of licensed premises will still not be able to reopen and be viable even with the reduced 1m social distancing restrictions in place. ""So we are looking for ongoing support for not just a few weeks but months or maybe even years ahead to get us back to anywhere near where we were before the pandemic."" Alastair Cameron said everything had now been put in place to enable the cinema to open safely when the time comes Cinemas can open, but very few will. Odeon appears to be the only major operator reopening on Wednesday in two locations - Glasgow Quay and Dunfermline.  Vue & Cineworld will return on 31 July and most others have pencilled in late July or August for a comeback. Alastair Cameron, owner of the Dominion Cinema in Edinburgh, which is the oldest cinema in Scotland, said he was unable to reopen until about mid-August. He said: ""The only product which is available at the moment is older films and our thoughts and feelings are that we need new films for our patrons to enjoy. ""If we opened and could not attract much business then we would have to close again so we need to wait until there is a new film released. I have my eye on Tenet which is a $200m film, which looks good."" Mr Cameron has removed 60 seats from his cinema for social distancing. Aberdeen's Masjid Alhikmah mosque is providing free masks and hand sanitiser, and has a queuing system in place which limits its capacity to 50 people After months, worshippers can now gather in congregations again, with physical distancing. In Aberdeen, afternoon prayers returned at the city's Masjid Alhikmah mosque. Spaces have been marked out on the floor for social distancing during prayer. The Catholic Church in Scotland expects the majority of churches to reopen, but some will take longer to have workable measures in place. Most have already been open for private prayer but they can now hold socially-distanced services for up to 50 people. A spokesman for the Catholic Church said the general mood was ""excitement and relief"" that the period of restrictions seemed to be coming closer to an end. Canon Gerald Sharkey during Communion at the first mass held at St Andrew's Cathedral in Glasgow since 19 March The Church of Scotland said the opportunity to return to places of worship, even on a limited basis, would bring spiritual and mental-health benefits. The church has left it up to each congregation to decide when to reopen their buildings for worship, subject to presbytery checks of individual risk assessments. Guidance has been issued to places of worship by the Scottish government. Measures which will remain for all faiths include the retention of worshippers' contact details for Test and Protect if required, a ban on hymn books and shared items and avoiding singing or chanting. Communities Secretary Aileen Campbell, said: ""I know it has been very difficult for our faith communities to be unable to come together in their places of worship during such challenging times. ""The updated guidance reflects the evolving scientific and health advice and has been developed in consultation with leaders and representatives of Scotland's faith and belief communities."" The Loch Ness visitor centre has all its virus control measures in place Museums, galleries and monuments can open with public health measures and booking in place. But the big attractions in Scotland say they will open at their own pace. In Glasgow, Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum will not return until 17 August, with the Riverside Museum following a week later and GoMA returning on 5 October. Dundee's V&A has announced it will reopen on 27 August. One attraction that is ready is the Loch Ness Centre in Inverness. The centre says customers will benefit from the new measures, which control the numbers flowing through the exhibition. Other attractions are expected to return gradually. The Surgeons' Hall Museums, which include The History of Surgery Museum and the Dental Collection, will open on Wednesday, but Glasgow's Science Centre needs longer because it is updating and improving its experiences. Libraries are able to operate but will return in line with each local council's programme of reopening. City councils in Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen all said their priority was to open after ensuring the facilities were safe for staff and the public. Visit Scotland has launched a campaign to attract people to tourist attractions across Scotland. The ""Take five for tourism"" appeal asks people across Scotland to support the sector in its ""time of need"". The five actions that could help restart the visitor economy are taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation. With tourism worth more than Â£11.5bn to the Scottish economy and supporting one in 12 jobs, the sector has been devastated by the Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown and travel restrictions.

"Maurice Roeves, right, played the villain Robert in Scottish television drama River City alongside Johnny Beattie and Jayd Johnson Actor Maurice Roeves - known for playing villains and hard men - has died at the age of 83. In a career spanning six decades, he acted in hundreds of TV shows and films including The Sweeney, Star Trek, The Eagle Has Landed and Tutti Frutti. Born in Sunderland, the actor was brought up in Glasgow and launched his career at the city's Citizen's Theatre. He also appeared in Eastenders, River City, Doctor Who and Irvine Welsh's The Acid House. Roeves' most recent role was a small part in the 2020 BBC television dramaThe Nest. His wife Vanessa Roeves told the BBC that he had been in ill health for some time. Despite playing tough characters on screen, Vanessa said Roeves was a ""softie"" in real life and that no part was too small for her husband. She said he was keen to be involved in his last project, despite the small appearance. And when Tutti Frutti was played on the launch of the BBC Scotland Channel, she said Roeves was delighted at having come ""full circle"". Vanessa also said that the family would often joke, ""Does your character make it to the end of this one?"" because his characters would always be killed off. However, Roeves found success at a time where lots of working class actors were just managing to break through into the mainstream, such as Albert Finney and Richard Harris. One of the hard man characters he played was the sinister McGurn (left) in the comedy series Rab C Nesbitt The Roeves family moved to Glasgow when he was seven years old as his father had a cotton mill in Partick. He went to school in the city and when he left full time education he took an an office job to earn money. But he returned to his studies and secured a place at the then Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama - now the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland. While there he won a gold medal for his acting. Maurice Roeves as Stotz in the Dr Who adventure The Caves of Androzani After graduating he got a job at the Citizens Theatre as an assistant stage manager but found himself playing small roles in between sweeping the stage floor. His first major role was as Lorenzo in the Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice when apparently screaming fans would gather at the stage door after the show to catch a glimpse of Maurice. Following this performance Disney sent a scout to Glasgow to see Roeves perform. He was then screen tested and offered his first film role, marking his debut in a career that would stretch more than 60 years of television and film. Roeves' film debut was in The Fighting Prince of Donegal in 1966, where he played the Irishman. Despite launching his film career, he continued in theatre roles. His next major role was in Macbeth at the Royal Court in London where he played Macduff, next to Sir Alec Guinness' Macbeth. One memorable Holywood screen role for Roeves was in Last of the Mohicans acting beside Daniel Day-Lewis and Wes Studi. Studi played Magua, a native American villain who ripped the heart out of Col Edmund Munro, played by Roeves. His friendship with Wes Studi lasted for more than 25 years and they met often near Wes's home in Santa Fe. Studisaid on social media,externalthat they shared haggis together. Allow Twitter content?

The Tokyo 2020 Olympics in Japan had to be postponed because of Covid-19 American athletes due to compete in the Tokyo Olympics will be provided with additional mental health support after the games were postponed until next year, officials say. United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC) officials said Wednesday that three independent mental health officers would give support to athletes ahead of the competition scheduled for Japan 2021. ""As our world continues to evolve during the challenges of a global pandemic and Games postponement, we want to ensure our athletes have the resources they need to focus on their mental health,"" said Bahati VanPelt, the USOPC chief of athlete services. The International Olympic Committee earlier said it was ""fully committed"" to the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 and had ""multiple scenarios"" for them to take place safely.  An investigation into a coronavirus-hit farm in Herefordshire has now been widened to include others in England and Scotland. The total number of positive coronavirus cases linked to the outbreak at AS Green & Co in Mathon now stands at 93, Public Health England (PHE) said. In an update on Wednesday evening, PHE said 76 workers who travelled on to other farms in England came to the UK on the same flight as the Herefordshire farm workers. It added that these 76 people have already been offered testing and no further cases have been identified to date. A further 63 workers who travelled on to Scottish farms were on the same flight. PHE said it has notified public health authorities in Scotland so this groupcan be ""followed-up appropriately"". A group of workers who travelled to the UK by private coach, including some of those who went on to work at AS Green and Co, are also being followed up, it added. Another worker fled the farm, despite being told not to. PHE said the agency that employed the worker (who tested negative for the virus) is in contact with them and has been advised they are self-isolating.Three other workers who fled the farm earlier have been traced. Karen Wright, director of Public Health for Herefordshire, said as testing of workers at the farm continues, officials expect to see the number of cases rise over the coming days ""before social distancing and infection prevention measures start to take effect"". She added that workers have been asked to remain on site and self-isolate to ""reduce risk of spread within the workforce and into the wider community"", and food and essential supplies were being delivered to the farm during this time. She said she knows local residents are concerned, but added the risk to the general public ""remains low"" The group said the Turkish villagers seemed seemed happy to host them Travel plans have been disrupted, borders have been closed and venues of all kinds have been shut during the pandemic. This posed a perfect storm of problems for a group of young musicians, whose road trip across Asia was brought to a standstill earlier this year. The band, called Tango Maluco, found themselves hunkering down in the most unlikely place - Erenler, a remote village in Turkey's Black Sea region. One member of the four-piece group, Mirjam Ellenbrok, told the BBC they got stuck in the village after the borders suddenly closed along their route. The group has made the most of their time, however, learning from the locals how to cook village specialities and prepare yogurt from cow's milk, while gardening in the lush surroundings. Read the full storyto see how the group whiled away the time in the mountain village. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Official Chinese media say that an undisclosed number of customers and delivery personnel have been told to self-isolate in southeastern China after Covid-19 was detected on shrimp containers imported from Ecuador. According to the official CGTN broadcaster, Covid-19 was detected on imported samples in the city of Pingxiang in Jiangxi province. The local government says that âno abnormal situation has been found in the city so farâ to suggest a potential localised outbreak. This is the second time this week that samples of seafood products have tested positive from the South American country. On Monday, the official China Daily said that seafood from three Ecuadorian companies were being pulled from shelves after six samples from inside shipping containers and the outer packaging of shrimp tested positive at customs. Many local governments and online retailers quickly issued suspension orders on these products and said that they were carrying out tests. In recent weeks, Chinese consumers have been nervous about eating seafood, after chopping boards used for imported salmon tested positive at a wholesale market in Beijing. It is believed this led to 335 people being infected across the capital city, and led to Beijing implementing a strict lockdown and aggressive testing procedures. A UK bingo chain has announced the permanent closure of 26 of its halls, putting 573 jobs at risk. Buzz Bingo, which is based in Nottingham, said it had taken the decision due to an ""unsustainable operating environment for the foreseeable future"". Its remaining 91 halls will continue to trade when they reopen from 6 August. Chief executive Chris Matthews said a restructure would ensure those clubs were able to adapt to new coronavirus safety measures and lower customer numbers. Buzz Bingo had to close its sites on 21 March due to the UK government lockdown and furloughed the majority of its staff. The company, which employs about 3,400 people, said it would ""take time"" for footfall at sites to reach pre-virus levels due to social distancing measures and weaker customer confidence.

Sweden's coronavirus containment strategy has been widely criticised Large parts of Swedenâs population are still susceptible to the coronavirus, the countryâs health authorities have said, casting further doubt on the so-called herd immunity strategy. Herd immunity happens when a large proportion of a population develops immunity to a contagious disease, be it through community transmission or vaccination. Sweden has seen far more coronavirus cases than any of its Nordic neighbours, recording 76,492 infections and 5,572 deaths to date,a Johns Hopkins University tally says,external. Sweden did not pursue a full lockdown, instead relying on voluntary social distancing and limited restrictions, such as the banning of large gatherings. The countryâs top epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, has previously expressed hope that herd immunity may be a useful by-product of the strategy, though not its aim. But on Tuesday a senior Swedish health official, Karin Tegmark Wisell, said large parts of Swedenâs population âhavenât been infectedâ by the coronavirus, meaning they are still susceptible. Earlier this month,a study from Spain raised questions about the feasibility of herd immunityas a way of tackling the coronavirus pandemic. Sir Ed Davey is one of two contenders for the leadership of the Liberal Democrat party Acting Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey has said an independent inquiry into the handling of coronavirus in the UK âcanât come soon enough for bereaved families.â Sir Ed said he had called for the inquiry at Prime Ministerâs Questions on Wednesday âbecause thereâs been tens of thousands of deathsâ and the bereaved families âneed to have some answersâ. Earlier todayPrime Minister Boris Johnson committed to ""an independent inquiryinto what happened"" during the UK coronavirus pandemic sometime ""in the future"". Mr Davey said he had since written to the prime minister asking him to âconfirm that it should be an inquiry under the Inquiries Act 2005,â which the acting leader claims would give it âreal teethâ¦ to get to the bottom of the issue"". âWeâve got to get on with it,"" he told the BBC. There have been more than 290,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 45,000 people have died, government figures show. Both case numbers and the death toll has been falling steadily, but concern remains over possible localised spikes in infection. Take a look atthe latest data on confirmed cases in your area. As coronavirus cases continue to climb, particularly in southern US states like Texas and Florida, many school districts are considering a combination of online and in-person learning - though the White House has continued to push for complete reopenings. A newPolitico/Morning Consult poll,externalhas found that a majority of voters do not think schools and daycare should fully open, in-person, this autumn. The poll also found that 65% of voters disagree with President Trump's threat to cut funding for schools that refuse to reopen. Another poll fromNavigator Research,externalon Wednesday said the number of parents who oppose reopening schools has jumped from 31% at the start of June to 51% as of 15 July. On Tuesday,an Axios/Ipsos poll,externalalso reported most parents, including a slim majority of Republicans, say it is risky to reopen schools. Now, a post to make you hungry if you've skipped lunch and are still a while away from dinner. Nando's, Pret A Manger and McDonald's are among the UK food chains to promise reductions in their prices after the chancellor ordered a temporary VAT cut from 20% to 5%. As a reminder, VAT is the tax you pay on everyday goods and services and is usually included in the price most consumers see. Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced the Â£4bn cut in VAT - which will stay in place until 12 January 2021- to help firms recover in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic and get consumers spending. The Treasury estimates households could save Â£160 a year on average, but not all companies will pass on the benefit. Many firms are expected to use the windfall to shore up finances hit by the lockdown rather than cut prices for customers. You can read more here. Governor Kevin Stitt Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt has announced he has tested positive for Covid-19. He is the first governor to publicly announce a virus diagnosis so far, US media report. ""I feel fine, I felt a little bit achy yesterday,"" the Republican governor told reporters. He said is isolating from his family - who have tested negative - and working from home. Stitt attended President Trump's controversialrally in Tulsa, Oklahoma,on 20 June, which local health officials have said was likely to have contributed to the city's recent spike in Covid-19 cases. The governor also told reporters he does not plan to make masks mandatory across the state. ""I'm so proud of how we've handled it this far,"" he said of the state's response to the pandemic. Shortly after the announcement, the Oklahoma Department of Health reported 1,075 additional cases - a new single-day record for the state,according to KOCO News,external. Three people who left a coronavirus-hit farm in England's West Midlands have now been traced,a council has said. Vegetable producers A S Green and Co in Mathon, Herefordshire,went into lockdown after testsshowed 74 people had tested positive for Covid-19. Of the three workers who left against advice, one had tested positive. They are all now self-isolating. A joint statement released on Wednesday from Herefordshire Council and Public Health Midlands said: ""Three workers (one of whom tested positive) left the farm despite being asked to remain on site and isolate. ""All three of these individuals have been reached through the agency that secured their employment, and all have confirmed they are self-isolating."" About 200 workers are said to be in quarantine at the site's live-in accommodation. The farm employs a mix of seasonal workers from the UK and abroad. Starbucks and Walmart on Wednesday announced new mask requirements in all  US stores amid Covid-19 surges in a number of regions across the country. Starbucks says facial coverings will be required for patrons and staff in all its cafes as of 15 July. The coffee retailer says it will also limit the number of customers allowed inside to maintain social distancing. Retail giant Walmart will enact a similar policy in its more than 5,000 stores by 20 July, and noted many stores were in regions already under government mandates regarding facial coverings. The company also said employees would receive special training to assist customers. ""We know it may not be possible for everyone to wear a face covering,"" company officials said. ""Our associates will be trained on those exceptions to help reduce friction for the shopper and make the process as easy as possible for everyone."" UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak has defended his job retention bonus scheme after MPs questioned its value for money. The policy - which was announced last week - will see the government pay employers Â£1,000 for every furloughed worker they retain past January. MPs on the Commons Treasury Committee described the scheme as ""badly-timed and poorly-targeted"". But Sunak said he believed it would ""serve as a significant incentive"" to preserve jobs amid the pandemic. Labour's Angela Eagle cautioned that scheme risked spending taxpayers' money for no benefit. ""Surely you could have had less deadweight if you'd have focused support on different sectors, why didn't you do that?"" she asked. But Sunak insisted the scheme ""will and can make a difference"". Kai Wei says people in Beijing have adopted a ""keep calm and carry on"" attitude As countries far and wide cautiously emerge from lockdowns, some places are regrettably heading back into them. From Europe to Australia, Asia to the US, restrictions are being reimposed in areas where coronavirus infections are on the rise again. The Chinese capital, Beijing, was among those places. We spoke to Kai Wei, a 29-year-old resident of the city, who gave us her guide to surviving a second lockdown. Kai's advice was to keep a happiness balance sheet, trying every means to stay entertained and sane. ""Live as normally as possible. And always wear a mask when you can go out!"" Read our pieceto see what other people living under second lockdowns have advised. From today, holidaymakers can take direct flights to Greece from the UK. So which other countries can you now visit and what do you need to do when you return? Passengers entering the UK from dozens of countries no longer have to quarantine for two weeks thanks to a relaxation of the government's travel quarantine rules on Friday. More than 50 countries - including many popular holiday spots - now pose ''a reduced risk'' from coronavirus, the government says. WalesandNorthern Irelandhave introduced quarantine exemptions for the same countries as England. Scotland is also allowing exemptions, although unlike the other nationsdoes not exempt travellers from Spain, because of concerns about their rate of coronavirus. You can read more here. Another 85 people have died in UK hospitals, care homes and the community after testing positive for coronavirus, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) says. It brings UK deaths to 45,053 under that measure, but the figures do not include all deaths involving Covid-19 across the UK, which are thought to have passed 55,500. The DHSC also said that in the 24-hours up to 09:00 BST on Wednesday, there had been a further 538 lab-confirmed UK cases. Overall, a total of 291,911 cases have been confirmed. Iran has recorded more than 260,000 coronavirus infections Iran has said 140 of its health workers have died with Covid-19 since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. ""We all owe them our lives and to honour them, we must observe health protocols,â said Sima Sadat Lari, an Iranian health ministry official. The country has seen a rapid surge in the number of coronavirus cases recently, after relaxing its lockdown restrictions in mid-April. So far, Iran has recorded 264,561 infections and 13,410 deaths since the start of the pandemic,according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University,external. Health officials have suggested the renewed surge in new infections could be attributed to more testing, and they have said people were ignoring social-distancing rules. On Wednesday Iranian President Hassan Rohani urged people to respect health regulations, in particular social distancing. ""We ask the people to avoid all gatherings and to adapt the way of life to the current situation,â President Hassan Rohani said at a cabinet meeting.

Mike Pompeo has taken a hardline against China during the pandemic The World Health Organizationâs (WHO) inquiry into the coronavirus pandemic will be a âcompletely white-washed investigationâ, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said, as he lashed out at China. Mr Pompeo accused China of failing to disclose information about the coronavirus when the first cases were detected in the city of Wuhan last year. That failure, Mr Pompeo said, had âkilled over 100,000 Americans and âcost the global economy trillions and trillions of dollarsâ. âAnd now it is allowing the World Health Organization to go in to conduct what I am confident will be a completely, a completely white-washed investigation,â Mr Pompeo said at a news conference on Wednesday. Mr Pompeo appears to be referring to an independent inquiry into the global response to the coronavirus pandemic, launched by the WHO earlier this month. Chaired by two former world leaders, the panel will be tasked with analysing responses to the pandemic by member states and the WHO itself. The panel will not, however, look into the origin of the coronavirus, as Mr Pompeo and other world leaders had demanded. Throughout the pandemic, the Trump administration has implicated the WHO in an alleged cover-up by the Chinese in the early stages of the pandemic.

And we know from inquiries we've seen before - whether it's the Iraq inquiry or the Leveson inquiry into the media, or Bloody Sunday into the army in Northern Ireland - they have the potential to shape and shatter the reputations of the most powerful and to probe their innermost thinking and calculations in moments of crisis. But there are an awful lot of unanswered questions. We still don't really know what the prime minister meant when he talked about an independent inquiry - it could be a full blown judge-led inquiry, or it could be a much lower calibre investigation led by an academic or maybe a select committee. We don't know the timeframe. The prime minister has indicated he does not think an inquiry should be held while we're still grappling with coronavirus.  So it could be months, even years away if we're having to wait to actually eliminate the virus or get a vaccine. And we don't know the remit of the inquiry or the authority it will have; will it be the sort of inquiry where witnesses are questioned under oath by barristers. With the number of deaths from coronavirus, the catastrophe that has inflicted on care homes, and because it's involved the government imposing restrictions on us never seen before in peacetime, my sense is it will have to be a similar sort of inquiry to that into the Iraq war.

He asks if the prime minister agrees with him that the worst reason for people to stay at home is for people to follow ""blanket government advice that takes no account of safety"". Mr Johnson says it is ""important"" that business should be ""carried on"". He says businesses need to have consultation with their workers on whether it is safe for them to return to workplaces. Reality Check Prime Minister Boris Johnson
said the government âis engaged in record investments in the NHS â Â£34bnâ. The figure the prime minister
is using is known as a âcash termsâ figure as it does not take into account
inflation (or rising prices). In fact, thegovernmentâs own figures,externalsay the
NHS budget will actually be Â£20.5bn larger by 2023-24, after inflation is taken
into account. This would see the annual
budget increase by 3.4% a year, which is significantly lower than the increases
of 6% seen in some years under the Blair and Brown Labour governments, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies.  House of CommonsParliament Labour's Tracy Brabin says her constituency needs ""enhanced support"", as workers are on statutory sick pay due to a local outbreak. She asks for daily postcode data on which areas are heavily hit and for a ""package of support"" for local businesses. The prime minister says that the government is giving councils as much data as they can, to make sure ""the whole country can start to get back to work"". House of CommonsParliament Earlier, Conservative MP Jack Lopresti asks about support for jobs in the the ""crucial"" aviation sector in south-west England. He says a ""wide-ranging support package"" should include a scrappage scheme for ""old and highly polluting"" aircraft.

But he adds: ""we will have an independent inquiry into what happened"".

He asks if the prime minister is ""once again"" ignoring the wishes of the Scottish people and launching a ""hostile"" act against devolution. Mr Johnson says that UK nations are getting more power in one generation than in ""living memory"". He says that the SNP want to hand power in Scotland ""back to Brussels"". Mr Blackford replies to say that the government needs to respect the result of the Scottish Parliament referendum in 1997. He says Scotland ""has the right"" to have decisions taken by those elected by Scots, rather than ""unelected bureaucrats"".

"PM commits to future independent inquiry into government's coronavirus response Keir Starmer says track and trace system ""is not working as promised"" Scotland has begun its most significant easing of lockdown measures Health Secretary Matt Hancock says face coverings will not be mandatory in offices in England China's UK ambassador says decision to ban Huawei from 5G network is 'disappointing and wrong' Study suggests coronavirus infection rate in England was 'lower than thought' before lockdown was lifted Richard Morris, Paul Seddon and Gavin Stamp Norman SmithAssistant political editor Boris Johnson has committed to a full independent inquiry into the coronavirus crisis. And we know from inquiries we've seen before - whether it's the Iraq inquiry or the Leveson inquiry into the media, or Bloody Sunday into the army in Northern Ireland - they have the potential to shape and shatter the reputations of the most powerful and to probe their innermost thinking and calculations in moments of crisis. But there are an awful lot of unanswered questions. We still don't really know what the prime minister meant when he talked about an independent inquiry - it could be a full blown judge-led inquiry, or it could be a much lower calibre investigation led by an academic or maybe a select committee. We don't know the timeframe. The prime minister has indicated he does not think an inquiry should be held while we're still grappling with coronavirus.  So it could be months, even years away if we're having to wait to actually eliminate the virus or get a vaccine. And we don't know the remit of the inquiry or the authority it will have; will it be the sort of inquiry where witnesses are questioned under oath by barristers. With the number of deaths from coronavirus, the catastrophe that has inflicted on care homes, and because it's involved the government imposing restrictions on us never seen before in peacetime, my sense is it will have to be a similar sort of inquiry to that into the Iraq war.

recover from the Covid-19 pandemic hasreceived a mixed reaction
from traders. Visiting
Rhyl in Denbighshire, Deputy Minister for Housing and Local Government Hannah Blythyn
said the capital funding moved from theTransforming Towns scheme,externalwould
support traders and improve public safety. But
one businesses owner there said it was a ""drop in the ocean"". Another
said adaptations could improve shoppers' confidence. There have been two more reported deaths from coronavirus in Wales, bringing the total to 1,545. The most recent reported deaths, by Public Health Wales, were from the Cwm Taf Morgannwg area.  An opposition politician has criticised the timescale for driving lessons resuming in Wales. Lessons will be able to resume from 27 July, the first minister has told the Senedd. Conservative member of the Senedd (MS) for Clwyd Darren Millar said learners and instructors had been ""crying out"" for a date but would undoubtedly be ""disappointed and frustrated"" that they have got to wait a further two weeks for lessons and even longer for tests. âLike with everything the Welsh Government announces with regards coming out of lockdown, there is always an unnecessary time lapse.â Two more people have died from coronavirus in Wales. According to today's report from Public Health Wales, there have been two more reported deaths and 18 new cases, bringing the total number of deaths to 1,545. There have been 16,854 confirmed cases of coronavirus in Wales. Credit cards spending
dropped by nearly halfat the start of lockdown as people played safe with
their finances and shunned big purchases. A
total of Â£8.7bn was spent on credit cards in the first full month of lockdown
in April, half the level of April last year, UK Finance said. The
banking trade body said this was the lowest level of spending seen since the
last economic downturn. The
cancellation of holiday plans is one likely reason for the fall. There are no current plans to ban smoking outside pubs, Mr Gething says. He said there had been no change to government plans on smoking regulations. He added: âThe more immediate point is the ban on smoking in playgrounds, school grounds, and hospitals, which I think enjoys widespread support across the public."" He said any future proposals are ones for âanother termâ of a Welsh Government.  Not all care workers visiting people's homes will be routinely tested for coronavirus, the health minister says. There have been calls to test all domiciliary carers who look after people in their own homes, regardless of whether they have symptoms, as happens with staff in care homes. Domciliary carers are only tested when they have symptoms. Vaughan Gething said some would receive anitbody tests, which show if people have had the disease, as part of a new surveillance plan. âThe evidence that we have had and published today doesn't support testing the whole sector as the right approach,â he said. âIt does underpin though, as I've said, everyone who has symptoms should get a test and self-isolate. âIt also underpins actually the importance of a move from the UK government on statutory sick pay or supportive pay where people are advised by the contact tracing service to self-isolate as they have in Germany. Speaking ahead of his press conference, opposition parties called for domiciliary carers to receive more testing. Conservative shadow social care minister Janet Finch Saunders said the service had âgone under the radarâ. âIf you work in domiciliary care, social care, district nurse, occupational therapy, physiotherapy â anybody going to somebodyâs home receiving care in the community, I think you should be tested,â she said. Age Cymruâs chief executive Victoria Lloyd said: âWe have been clear about the need for adequate and practical access to fast testing for all social care staff to support infection control measures. ""As such we would support a programme of regular testing for domiciliary care staff."" The difficulties that England are experiencing in making face masks compulsory in different settings showed that it ""isnât a
straightforward question,"" according to Vaughan Gething. The health minister said there were issues with ""enforceability"" and with ""questioning people"" who arenât wearing masks. Mr Gething confirmed it was the Welsh Governmentâs position not to make the wearing of face masks in
shops mandatory. First Minister Mark Drakeford said people were advised to wear face
coverings in crowded areas but has resisted calls to enforce people to do so. Mr Gething
said that the Welsh Government was continuing to take advice from the chief medical officer and following global scientific evidence regarding face
coverings. âIf that
evidence was to change, we would happily consider changing our position,â he
said. âFace
coverings are the last tier of measures to take, in the sense of protecting all
of us. It still starts by following that social-distancing guidance. Itâs much
more important than wearing a face covering. ""A face
covering wonât protect you if youâre bumping along with other people instead of
observing social distancing.â He also said the advice on face coverings may change if the government had to
enforce a local lockdown as has happened in Leicester and Blackburn.  You should still work from home if you can and avoid using
public transport where possible, the Welsh Government has said. It tweeted its latest workplace guidelines and said employers
must do all they can to keep 2 metres distance and protect those who need to
return to the workplace.  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Wearing a face covering could be a mandatory part of any future local lockdown, according to the first minister. Face coverings will be mandatory on public transport in Wales from 27 July. Mark Drakeford said he was also considering the use of face masks in supermarkets and crowded tourist destinations in Wales. Speaking at first minister's questions, Mr Drakeford said that they were keeping everything ""under review"". ""I've asked for further advice for example, on suggestions that supermarkets in tourist destinations have been crowded over this last weekend as populations in those areas increase. ""Mandatory use of face coverings as part of a local lockdown, should that become necessary, will certainly be part of a potential repertoire here in Wales. ""And if the prevalence of coronavirus in Wales were to rise, our advice would be revisited. ""In the meantime, the position in Wales is anybody going into a shop who wishes to wear a face mask is absolutely entitled to do so. ""Our advice is that if it is crowded you should wear one."" But he said that for now the advice from Wales' Chief Medical Officer ""has not changed. They have a marginal utility, but they also have identifiable downsides."" Since mid June all care staff have been tested for coronavirus on a weekly basis which has shown the prevalence of the virus in care homes to be low, said the health minister. The most recent figures show there have been a total of 28,763 tests on care home residents. This is 706 more than the week before but 95.6% of tests proved negative - and only three residents tested positive in the last week. Figures show 60,464 staff had been tested too; 98% of tests were negative. Vaughan Gething said low case numbers was ""very good news"" but low prevalence of the disease was likely to generate a higher rate of false positives. He said that this had implications for the use of antigen tests as a screening tool and for those individuals who may be asked to self isolate. The Welsh Government would continue to test care home staff on a weekly basis for a further four weeks. ""If low prevalence trends continue during this period we will move to a fortnightly regime for antigen testing. Alongside this, we will roll out a surveillance programme of antibody testing for social care and domiciliary staff"", he added. The new coronavirus testing strategy will ensure  immediate action is taken if new cases are identified in communities, the health minister has promised. This would include using mobile testing units to test all care home staff and residents, Vaughan Gething said. He said if care homes were identified as higher risk - for example because of local outbreaks - bespoke testing regimes would be implemented. ""This risk-based approach will also apply to other settings and localities, enabling local teams to use testing as part of a wider approach to surveillance and outbreak control"". Health Minister Vaughan Gething has outlined the Welsh Government's new coronavirus testing strategy. Speaking at the daily coronavirus news briefing, he said the strategy sets out ""why, where and how we will test to achieve clear outcomes"". Mr Gething said the Welsh Government's testing priorities for the coming weeks and months would be:  He said: ""An enormous amount has been achieved over the past few months and I would like to thank everyone for their contribution. But, we now need to prepare ourselves for this next phase â and for what might be a difficult winter"". Walesâ new coronavirus
  testing strategy has been published by the health minister. Vaughan Gething  said the strategy focused on four main areas:  There are
  currently two different forms of testing in Wales; the antigen virus
  detection test that shows if someone currently has the virus, and the
  antibody test which is used to determine whether a person has been
  previously infected. He said the weekly testing programme for care homes would continue for
  another four weeks, with the data on prevalence rates closely monitored. If
  prevalence rates remained at the current low levels then the testing cycle would move fortnightly. Mr Gething, said: âWe now have a national testing infrastructure that means
  anyone who needs a test can access one. This enables our contact tracing
  system to help control the transmission of the disease as lockdown measures
  are eased. âOur NHS Wales Test, Trace, Protect service is
  fundamental to helping us to find a way to live with the disease until a
  vaccine or treatment is available."" The Welsh Government's daily coronavirus briefing is due to start at 12:30 BST. Today's speaker is Health Minister Vaughan Gething and he is expected to give details of Wales' new coronavirus testing strategy. We'll give you the main updates here - you can also watch the

"The UK's inflation rate rose to 0.6% in June as the coronavirus lockdown began to ease. The Consumer Prices Index (CPI) picked up slightly from May's four-year low of 0.5%,the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.,external Food and alcohol prices fell, but prices for clothing and games rose, the ONS said. Despite the slight increase in the rate, inflation remains below the Bank of England's 2% target. Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician for economic statistics at the ONS, said: ""The inflation rate has increased for the first time this year, but remains low by historical standards. ""Due to the impact of the coronavirus, clothing prices have not followed the usual seasonal pattern this year, with the normal falls due to the start of the summer sales failing to materialise. ""Prices for computer games and consoles have risen, but food prices, particularly vegetables, have fallen."" Inflation has fallen sharply during the coronavirus crisis as consumer demand has slumped. In June, men's clothing in particular rose in price, with increases coming ""across almost the full range"", the ONS said. Women's clothing showed ""a more mixed picture across the different products"", but with the overall effect still upward. Games, toys and hobbies, particularly computer games and computer games consoles, made the biggest contribution to the inflation rise, the ONS said. ""It is possible that prices have been influenced by the coronavirus (Covid-19) lockdown changing the timing of demand and the availability of some items, particularly consoles,"" the ONS added. Inflation is the rate at which the prices for goods and services increase. It's one of the key measures of financial wellbeing because it affects what consumers can buy for their money. If there is inflation, money doesn't go as far. It's expressed as a percentage increase or decrease in prices over time. For example, if the inflation rate for the cost of a litre of petrol is 2% a year, motorists need to spend 2% more at the pump than 12 months earlier. And if wages don't keep up with inflation, purchasing power and the standard of living falls. What is the inflation rate? Since many areas of the economy were completely shut down in June, the ONS said it had to estimate or ""impute"" some of the data. Jeremy Thomson-Cook, chief economist at financial services firm Equals, said the slight increase in the inflation rate was ""a positive sign"", but added that the outlook remained ""messy"". ""Food prices are falling from lockdown levels, clothing demand is out of kilter with typical seasonal patterns, demand for entertainment during lockdown provided a pronounced bump in prices, and the ONS has only been able to log 84% of the normal price quotes due to unavailability,"" he said. ""For now, however, inflation remains low, and both consumers and the Bank of England will be happy with that.""

"Credit cards spending dropped by nearly half at the start of lockdown as people played safe with their finances and shunned big purchases. A total of Â£8.7bn was spent on credit cards in the first full month of lockdown in April, half the level of April last year, UK Finance said. The banking trade body said this was the lowest level of spending seen since the last economic downturn. The cancellation of holiday plans is one likely reason for the fall. Consumers often use credit cards to pay for summer getaways or major purchases such as household appliances, owing to the extra protection available if something goes wrong. Many people uncertain about the coronavirus effect on their jobs and finances would have put off buying these items, UK Finance said. The temporary closure of shops and travel restrictions would also have meant many people put these buying decisions on hold. Clothing and games push up UK shop prices Credit card freeze extended for three months Some pre-paid holidays or flights were refunded into credit card accounts after being cancelled, and consumers adopted a safety-first approach to their credit card spending similar to that seen following the banking crisis of a decade ago. As a result, outstanding balances on credit cards fell by almost Â£4.7bn in April 2020, the largest monthly fall in over a decade, as many people opted to make repayments rather than spend on their credit cards, UK Finance said. Separate data from the Bank of England has also shown this repayment trend. Eric Leenders, from UK Finance, said: ""The Covid-19 crisis has significantly changed how, where and when people spend their money."" With many shops closed in April, the proportion of card spending that was completed online hit a record level. A third of credit and debit card spending was made over the internet, according to the UK Finance figures. The picture for debit cards is more complex. With shops closed, the use of these cards was down 5.1% in April compared with the same month a year ago. Contactless payments saw a significant drop, as many people were working from home and making fewer occasional purchases, as well as commuting less. However, with the limit on contactless payments having risen from Â£30 to Â£45 and some shops refusing cash, the average purchase using this technology rose above Â£10 for the first time.

"This video can not be played 'Their freedom has been taken away' US President Donald Trump has signed an order to end preferential economic treatment for Hong Kong, after China enacted a new security law there. Hong Kong would be treated ""the same as mainland China"", Mr Trump said. He also signed a law to impose sanctions on officials who cracked down on rights. China has strongly criticised the move, vowing to take retaliatory action. The US sees the security law as a threat to the freedoms Hong Kong has enjoyed under a 1984 agreement. That special status was agreed between China and Hong Kong's former colonial power, the UK, before sovereignty was returned to Beijing in 1997. The new security law - which outlaws criticism of China's government - is the most sweeping change to the political landscape of Hong Kong since then. This video can not be played Tea, drugs and war: Hong Kong's British history explained Speaking in the Rose Garden on Tuesday, Mr Trump said his executive order would end preferential treatment for Hong Kong. ""No special privileges, no special economic treatment and no export of sensitive technologies,"" said the president, who first announced in May that his administration would begin paring back the territory's special status. He also told reporters he had signed the Hong Kong Autonomy Act, which passed unanimously in Congress earlier this month. ""This law gives my administration powerful new tools to hold responsible the individuals and the entities involved in extinguishing Hong Kong's freedom,"" Mr Trump told the news conference. After being questioned by a journalist, the president said he had no plans to speak to Chinese President Xi Jinping. He also told reporters that ""we hold China fully responsible for concealing the [coronavirus] and unleashing it upon the world"". Mr Trump's own administration is under scrutiny for its response to the pandemic. The US has 3.4 million recorded cases, the highest in the world, and more than 136,000 deaths. The president's policy address digressed into a lengthy political attack on his Democratic presidential challenger, Joe Biden, ranging from trade and immigration to policing and climate change. This video can not be played Many Hong Kong residents are worried the new security law means the ""one country, two systems"" principle no longer exists China's foreign ministry condemned the latest US moves, saying they were a ""gross interference"" in its domestic affairs. In a strongly-worded statement, it said the country would also impose retaliatory sanctions against US individuals and entities to ""safeguard China's legitimate interests"". ""The US attempt to obstruct the implementation of the national security law for Hong Kong will never succeed,"" the statement said. ""We urge the US side to correct its mistakes, refrain from implementing the act and stop interfering in China's internal affairs in any way. China will firmly respond if the US goes ahead.""

It was not a matter of if, but when. Scrapping Hong Kong's special status will mean companies based there will now have to evaluate what this means for them. Hong Kong is a re-exporting hub, which means that goods that go through Hong Kong to the US but have come from somewhere else - like China for instance - have avoided the tariffs the US has slapped on China. Now that Hong Kong's special status is gone - mainland Chinese companies may look for another place to send their goods - which would see Hong Kong's port and logistics businesses suffer. And how much of an impact will this have on American and multinational companies using Hong Kong as a regional hub? Well, as one business consultant told me - the structural reasons for why a company would use Hong Kong as a hub are still there - low tax rates, good geographic location, convertibility of currency. But perception is reality - and if the perception is that doing business in Hong Kong has become so much more onerous - why not decamp to mainland China or Singapore instead? Washington-Beijing ties have become increasingly frayed in recent months. With Mr Trump facing an uphill battle for re-election this November, he and Mr Biden have accused each other of being weak on China. On Monday, the administration condemned China's military build-up in the South China Sea, accusing it of bullying neighbours. Last Friday, Mr Trump told reporters on Air Force One that a ""phase two"" trade deal with China was in doubt because of its handling of coronavirus, which he called the ""plague"".

"The UK's inflation rate rose to 0.6% in June as the coronavirus lockdown began to ease. The Consumer Prices Index (CPI) picked up slightly from May's four-year low of 0.5%,the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.,external Food and alcohol prices fell, but prices for clothing and games rose, the ONS said. Despite the slight increase in the rate, inflation remains below the Bank of England's 2% target. Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician for economic statistics at the ONS, said: ""The inflation rate has increased for the first time this year, but remains low by historical standards. ""Due to the impact of the coronavirus, clothing prices have not followed the usual seasonal pattern this year, with the normal falls due to the start of the summer sales failing to materialise. ""Prices for computer games and consoles have risen, but food prices, particularly vegetables, have fallen."" Inflation has fallen sharply during the coronavirus crisis as consumer demand has slumped. In June, men's clothing in particular rose in price, with increases coming ""across almost the full range"", the ONS said. Women's clothing showed ""a more mixed picture across the different products"", but with the overall effect still upward. Games, toys and hobbies, particularly computer games and computer games consoles, made the biggest contribution to the inflation rise, the ONS said. ""It is possible that prices have been influenced by the coronavirus (Covid-19) lockdown changing the timing of demand and the availability of some items, particularly consoles,"" the ONS added. Inflation is the rate at which the prices for goods and services increase. It's one of the key measures of financial wellbeing because it affects what consumers can buy for their money. If there is inflation, money doesn't go as far. It's expressed as a percentage increase or decrease in prices over time. For example, if the inflation rate for the cost of a litre of petrol is 2% a year, motorists need to spend 2% more at the pump than 12 months earlier. And if wages don't keep up with inflation, purchasing power and the standard of living falls. What is the inflation rate? Since many areas of the economy were completely shut down in June, the ONS said it had to estimate or ""impute"" some of the data. Jeremy Thomson-Cook, chief economist at financial services firm Equals, said the slight increase in the inflation rate was ""a positive sign"", but added that the outlook remained ""messy"". ""Food prices are falling from lockdown levels, clothing demand is out of kilter with typical seasonal patterns, demand for entertainment during lockdown provided a pronounced bump in prices, and the ONS has only been able to log 84% of the normal price quotes due to unavailability,"" he said. ""For now, however, inflation remains low, and both consumers and the Bank of England will be happy with that."" Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said the small rise in inflation was unlikely to be sustained and that deflation was ""around the corner"". ""In fact, by July or August, CPI inflation may have fallen below zero,"" he said. Discounting from retailers and the impact ofChancellor Rishi Sunak's ""eat out to help out"" schemewould push inflation down, he said.

""The business model here is based on volume and we are not getting anything like the volume through and we'll just have to cut our cloth accordingly."" ""We'll have to get enough fat on before the winter and get ourselves through to April,"" adds Mr Henderson. The hotel opened an outdoor marquee in its car park last week and today was able to open indoors too, but social distancing means only half the tables can be used. ""I think people at this stage are more comfortable sitting outside and luckily it is reasonably warm and has been quite popular actually - last week we were quite busy before we were allowed indoors,"" Mr Henderson adds. Visit Scotland has launched a campaign to attract people to tourist attractions across Scotland. The ""Take five for tourism"" appeal asks people across Scotland to support the sector in its ""time of need"". The five actions that could help restart the visitor economy are taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation. With tourism worth more than Â£11.5bn to the Scottish economy and supporting one in 12 jobs, the sector has been devastated by the Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown and travel restrictions.

Take this quiz to test your knowledge of the government's advice on coronavirus during the summer in the UK . Soon there will be almost no excuse for notwearing a face mask while out shopping in England- covering your face will be as essential as remembering your cash or bank card. The rulesdiffer a little around the UK. But wherever you live, it's going to be hard to avoid covering up your mouth and nose. And that raises a host of dilemmas. Andrew SegalBBC South West Staff at Cornwall's Eden Project have been told that job losses for up to 40% of its staff ""are sadly inevitable"" because of the effect of the coronavirus pandemic on its finances and scale of operations. Managers said the prolonged lockdown closure and continuing restrictions on visitor numbers of the attraction near St Austell had resulted in the managing company ""losing more than Â£7m in revenue so far this financial year"" and they had told staff ""redundancies will need to follow"". Bosses said a six-week consultation process and restructuring had begun ""across all areas and levels of the company"". They estimated that the equivalent of about 150 full-time jobs would be lost out of the current total of 375 full-time equivalent jobs, but that would equate to between 200 and 220 people in full and part-time roles ""likely to leave the organisation"". Eden said it ""would provide the fullest support in whatever ways it can to those employees whose jobs are at risk"". Cleaners didn't know graffiti on a London Underground train was by world-renowned artist Banksy when they removed it, the BBC's been told. The coronavirus-inspired piece, If You Don't Mask, You Don't Get, was painted inside a Circle Line service carriage. But by the time he unveiled the work on hisInstagram account,external, it had been wiped away by Transport for London (TfL) cleaning crews. A TfL source said: ""It was treated like any other graffiti on the network."" ""The job of the cleaners is to make sure the network is clean, especially given the current climate,"" they said. A video posted online showed a man - presumed to be Banksy - disguised as a cleaner and armed with stencils. It is thoughtthe stunt, revealed on Tuesday, was designed to encourage the use of face masks. Daniel WainwrightBBC England Data Unit Another 22 people are confirmed to have died with Covid-19 in hospitals in England. However, none of those reported today died yesterday. The data published by NHS England cuts off as of 16:00 BST the day before publication and it is possible we will see deaths from 14 July added to the toll over the next few days. The figures announced today include one person who died in April, three in May and two in June. Boris Johnson has for the first timecommitted to an ""independent inquiry"" into the coronavirus pandemic. The prime minister said it was not right to devote ""huge amounts of official time"" to an inquiry when the UK is ""in the middle"" of a pandemic. But he said the government would seek to learn lessons ""in the future"" and ""certainly we will have an independent inquiry in to what happened"". The prime minister has repeatedly rejected opposition calls for an inquiry into the government's handling of the coronavirus pandemic.

Reality Check Prime Minister Boris Johnson was asked about the preparedness of the NHS for a potential second wave of coronavirus this winter. He responded by saying that: âjust in the last year since this government has been in office, there are now 12,000 more nurses in the NHS, 6,000 more doctors.â This is true. 
The number of nurses in the NHS in England has increased from 281,474 in July 2019 â when he first formed a government â to 294,553 in March 2020, the latest month we have data for. Thatâs an increase of 13,079. He gets the slightly smaller 12,000 figure by comparing March 2019 with March 2020.
In the same period the number of doctors has gone up from 120,378 to 126,523 â or up 6,145. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter Credit cards spending dropped by nearly half at the start of lockdown as people played safe with their finances and shunned big purchases. A total of Â£8.7bn was spent on credit cards in the first full month of lockdown in April, half the level of April last year, UK Finance said. The banking trade body said this was the lowest level of spending seen since the last economic downturn. The cancellation of holiday plans isone likely reason for the fall. Today's session of Prime Minister's Questions - the penultimate before the parliament's summer break - has ended. Here's what happened: An ex-serviceman who survived coronavirus has been praised for donating more plasma than anyone else to treatment trials. Stephen Franklin, 54, from Birmingham, became ill in March after volunteering to look after key workers' children at a school. Since recovering, he has donated blood plasma, containing antibodies, five times to a national trial. The team thanked him, saying every donation was""incredibly valuable"". Asos will repay cash to the government it claimed for furloughing workers after its sales grew in lockdown. The online retailer said that group sales increased by 10% to Â£1bn in the four months to 30 June. The rise was driven by shoppers in international markets, with sales in the UK dipping by 1%. Asos boss Nick Beighton said: ""This has been a tough time for all businesses, but we have remained focused on doing the right thing for our people."" In its trading update, the fashion firm said that it would be returning cash it received under the government's furlough scheme after a""better than initially-expected full-year performance"".

"Apple has been told it will not have to pay Ireland â¬13bn (Â£11.6bn) in back taxes after winning an appeal at the European Union's second-highest court. It overturns a 2016 ruling which found the tech giant had been given illegal tax breaks by Dublin. The EU's General Court said it had annulled that decision because there was not enough evidence to show Apple broke EU competition rules. It is a blow for the European Commission, which brought the case. However, it has 14 days to appeal against the decision at the EU's supreme court, the European Court of Justice. ""This case was not about how much tax we pay, but where we are required to pay it,"" Apple said in a statement. ""We're proud to be the largest taxpayer in the world, as we know the important role tax payments play in society."" The Irish government - which had also appealed against the ruling - said it had ""always been clear"" Apple received no special treatment. ""The correct amount of Irish tax was charged... in line with normal Irish taxation rules."" EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, who brought the case, said she would ""study the judgment and reflect on possible next steps"". Dutch MEP Paul Tang called the ruling ""deeply unfair"". ""I suspect that many people in Ireland think... 'Why is there a company that pays 0.05% in taxes?' I pay more taxes than Apple, for that matter. Many people pay more taxes."" Margrethe Vestager has been trying to crack down on tax avoidance The European Commission brought the action after claiming Ireland had allowed Apple to attribute nearly all its EU earnings to an Irish head office that existed only on paper, thereby avoiding paying tax on EU revenues. The commission said this constituted illegal aid given to Apple by the Irish state. Irish EU court appeal on Apple tax ruling But the Irish government argued that Apple should not have to repay the back taxes, deeming that its loss was worth it to make the country an attractive home for large companies. Ireland - which has one of the lowest corporate tax rates in the EU - is Apple's base for Europe, the Middle East and Africa. In Wednesday's ruling, the Luxembourg-based General Court sided with that position, saying there was not enough evidence to show Apple had received illegal state aid or minimised its tax bill. One rather curious feature of this case is that if the ruling had gone the other way, and Ireland had been on the losing side, its ""punishment"" for breaching EU law would have been to receive a large amount of money: taxes the Commission said were owed by Apple. That did not happen, so the ruling - subject to any appeal - means Apple doesn't in law owe the money, so Ireland won't get it. In some quarters of Ireland, there will be relief that an agreement that helped encourage Apple to invest has not been overturned after the event. But the sentiment is far from universal. A Sinn FÃ©in spokesman called it a bad day for the Irish taxpayer that would draw negative attention to the country's international tax reputation. There is growing criticism of so-called sweetheart tax deals across the European Union and the bloc has been trying to clamp down. The ruling will therefore be a blow to Ms Vestager, who has taken aim at a host of big corporations over their allegedly anti-competitive practices. Amazon v EU: Has the online giant met its match? Last year, she lost a case against Starbucks, which was accused of owing â¬30m in back taxes to the Netherlands. Rulings on Ikea and Nike's tax arrangements in that country are due soon. Jason Collins, partner and head of tax at law firm Pinsent Masons, said: ""Apple's victory shows that European courts are unwilling to call beneficial tax regimes state aid, even when designed to attract foreign investment - provided they apply the rules consistently. ""This will be a very welcome outcome for other multinationals who have been watching this case closely."" However, he said Brussels was likely to appeal and EU efforts to tackle tax avoidance would continue. ""We expect the EU to continue applying pressure in this area,"" he said.

"The Chinese government has said it is ""strongly opposed"" to the UK's ""groundless"" ban of Huawei's 5G kit. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying added Beijing would ""take measures to safeguard"" the ""legitimate interests"" of Chinese companies. The US, however, has welcomed the move and announced new restrictions against the firm. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the US wouldcurb travel access for some of Huawei's workers,external. ""The State Department will impose visa restrictions on certain employees of Chinese technology companies like Huawei that provide material support to regimes engaging in human rights violations and abuses globally,"" he told a news conference. Mr Pompeo also passed comment on the fact the UK had given mobile networks until 2027 to remove Huawei's 5G equipment, saying: ""Faster is always better."" Earlier, President Trump had seemingly taken personal credit for the UK's action. ""We convinced many countries, many countries - and I did this myself for the most part - not to use Huawei because we think it's an unsafe security risk,"" the US leader said. Mr Trump made the comments as he attempted to increase pressure on Beijing byannouncing an executive order ending preferential treatment for Hong Kongin response to a new security law brought in by China. Donald Trump labelled Huawei a ""big security risk"" Huawei has repeatedly said itwould not cause harm to any country. The UK's digital secretary announced on Tuesday the country's telecoms networks would not be allowed to buy new Huawei 5G kit from 31 December and all such equipment should bestripped out of mobile networks by 2027. In addition, it wants BT's Openreach and other broadband infrastructure providers to stop using Huawei's gear in the rollout of full-fibre broadband within the next couple of years. China's ambassador to the UK said the decision was ""not only disappointing, it's disheartening"". ""The way you treat Huawei will be followed very closely by other Chinese businesses,"" Liu Xiaoming added. But the foreign ministry arguably used even stronger language. ""The UK side has used groundless risks as an excuse to co-operate with the United States... violating the relevant commitments made by the UK,"" Ms Hua said. ""Any decisions and actions must come at a cost,"" she added, without being more specific. Mr Huiyao Wang - an adviser to the Chinese government - told BBC Radio 4's Today programme Beijing still hoped the 2027 ban might be reversed before it came into effect. But, as things stood, it could have an impact on other Chinese investment in Britain. ""It goes against the UK tradition as the open liberal leader in free trade,"" the founder of the Centre for China and Globalisation think tank said. ""This is going to probably have very negative implications."" The UK government said it had based its decision on the advice of security chiefs who had judged they could no longer mitigate the risks of using Huawei's equipment in light of new US sanctions. The sanctions are designed to prevent the company having its own chips manufactured, making it buy in supplies from elsewhere. And GCHQ's National Cyber Security Centre said this meant Huawei's equipmentwas likely to face more,external""security and reliability problems"" as a consequence. This video can not be played Huawei's UK director of communications Ed Brewster says the UK's decision is about trade. Robert Hannigan, the former director of GCHQ, told BBC News the sanctions had indeed made ""a critical difference"". ""[It] really pushes all the production and design and testing into China and makes it extremely difficult for anyone to see what is going on,"" he said. Huawei: What does the ban mean for you? Huawei 5G kit must be removed by 2027 Huawei UK 5G ban 'should happen sooner' But he did not believe any Chinese retaliation would come in the form of a hack attack. ""No doubt China will want to express its displeasure,"" Mr Hannigan said. ""But there's no particular reason to think that will be in cyber-space. ""There will be a lot of a lot of sound and fury. ""It may not amount to that much in the end."" Robert Hannigan ran the UK's cyber-spy agency GCHQ between 2014 and 2017 The UK accounts for a only small fraction of Huawei's revenue,which grew 13% in the first half of the year,externaldespite earlier efforts by Washington to disrupt its business. However, its concern is Westminster's move will motivate other countries to take similar measures. Announcing the ban to the House of Commons on Tuesday, Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden said it had not been an easy decision but was the right one for UK telecoms networks, national security and the UK economy. What is 5G? Why is Huawei being banned from the UK's 5G network? Trudeau rejects calls to release Huawei executive He said the cumulative cost, when coupled with earlier restrictions announced against Huawei, would be up to Â£2bn, and the total delay to 5G's rollout would be two to three years . This video can not be played Watch: The digital secretary says providers must remove Huawei's 5G kit by 2027 5G technology promises faster internet speeds and the capacity to support more wireless devices, which should be a boon to everything from mobile gaming to higher-quality video streams. 5G connections are already available in dozens of UK cities and towns, but coverage can be sparse. The UK last reviewed Huawei's role in its telecoms infrastructure in January, when it was decided to let the company remain a supplier but introduced a cap on its market share. But in May the US introduced new sanctions designed to disrupt Huawei's ability to get its own chips manufactured. The Trump administration claims that Huawei provides a gateway for China to spy on and potentially attack countries that use its equipment, suggestions the company strongly rejects. The US has called for members of the Five Eyes alliance - which also includes the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand - to avoid Huawei kit.

"A Â£4bn cut in VAT has come into force, allowing firms in the food, drink and hospitality sectors to slash prices. Nando's, Pret A Manger and McDonald's are among firms to promise reductions after the chancellor ordered a temporary VAT cut from 20% to 5%. The Treasury estimates households could save Â£160 a year on average, but not all firms will pass on the benefit. Many companies are expected to use the windfall to shore up finances hit by the lockdown, rather than cut prices. The VAT reduction will stay until 12 January next year, Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced last week. It was part of a package of measures to help firms recover and get consumers spending. VAT - Value Added Tax - is paid on everyday goods and services, but the tax is usually included in the price most consumers see. Visitors may not see the thrill of VAT cut Summer Statement: Key points at a glance Several restaurants and food-to-go chains have announced price cuts: Nando's said it would pass on ""100% of the benefits"" from the tax cut to its customers, reducing the price of a quarter chicken by 55p Pret A Manger will cut the price of a takeaway latte by 35p to Â£2.40 from Wednesday, while the price of hot food will be cut from Friday KFC is reducing the price of sharing buckets by Â£1 and slashing the cost of certain ""fan favourites"" by 50p McDonald's is recommending that its franchisees cut prices on an array of products, including the Big Mac, Quarter Pounder and coffee Pub chain Wetherspoon is to reduce prices on meals, coffee and soft drinks, and reduce prices on popular beers Starbucks will pass on the full 15% discount on coffee served in company-operated stores. Other shops and venues with Starbucks licences will be left to pass on whatever reductions suit their business. Value Added Tax, or VAT, is the tax you have to pay when you buy goods or services. The standard rate of VAT in the UK is 20%, with about half the items households spend money on subject to this rate. There is a reduced rate of 5% which applies to some things such as children's car seats and home energy. When you see a price for something in a shop, any VAT will already have been added. There are also various items for which you do not have to pay any VAT, such as most supermarket food, children's clothing, newspapers and magazines.

Malcolm Bell, chief executive of Visit Cornwell, said the chancellor's move was to support business, not help holidaymakers. He said some firms had reported tourists calling them to ask for 15% off their holiday booking. ""My message to customers is this is to help the businesses, not to reduce the cost of their holiday. It is only a temporary relaxation up to January."" Many attractions such as museums, parks and zoos, might also not pass on the reduction. Bernard Donoghue, director of the Association of Leading Visitor Attractions (Alva), said he expected the VAT cut would go towards helping venues ""repair their finances as opposed to being passed on to customers"". Alva members were seeing a spike in demand after three months of lockdown, with attractions that offer pre-booked visits ""vastly oversubscribed"", he said. Pub chain Wetherspoon said it would use the tax break to help fund lower prices on some of its most popular beers. However, this move drew criticism from Tom Stainer, chief executive of the Campaign for Real Ale (Camra), and James Calder, chief executive of the Society for Independent Brewers (Siba). ""Like all pubs, Wetherspoon will not be able to benefit from a VAT reduction on beer sales and it is disappointing to see them potentially mislead customers into believing cheaper beer prices are as a direct result of the chancellor's measures,"" he said. Wetherspoon has produced promotional posters to advertise food price cuts, including one called Sunak's Specials and another called Dishi Rishi. Its chairman, Tim Martin, has campaigned for tax equality between pubs, restaurants and supermarkets for many years. He said: ""Supermarkets pay no VAT on food sales and pubs pay 20%. Supermarkets pay about 2p per pint of business rates and pubs pay about 20p. ""A VAT reduction will help pubs and restaurants reverse this trend - creating more jobs, helping high streets and eventually generating more tax income for the government."" But he said that not every hospitality business would be able to reduce prices immediately. ""Some will need to retain the benefit of lower VAT just to stay in business. Others may need to invest in upgrading their premises.

Supermarkets pay about 2p per pint of business rates and pubs pay about 20p. ""A VAT reduction will help pubs and restaurants reverse this trend - creating more jobs, helping high streets and eventually generating more tax income for the government."" But he said that not every hospitality business would be able to reduce prices immediately. ""Some will need to retain the benefit of lower VAT just to stay in business. Others may need to invest in upgrading their premises. ""However, lower VAT and tax equality will eventually lead to lower prices, more employment, busier High Streets and more taxes for the government."" What is VAT and how is it changing?

"The UK's decision to ban Huawei's 5G kits from use in mobile networks and to also stop using its equipment in full-fibre broadband networks is not without consequence for the country's internet users. As the Digital Minister Oliver Dowden acknowledged, the decisions will have ""consequences for every constituency in the country"". The Chinese firm itself has claimed customers will face bigger bills as a consequence of the billions of pounds that will be spent ripping out its kit and moving to other suppliers. And there could be further consequences for the wider economy if Huawei diverts its research and recruitment funds elsewhere, not to mention other Chinese companies that might now see the UK as a less friendly market. No. The move affects the equipment at radio masts and inside telephone exchanges that operators use rather than individual consumer devices sold by the firm. ""It doesn't directly affect the Huawei technology you use at home, such as smartphones, laptops and tablets,"" explains the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC). ""All your apps should continue to work, and your phone/laptop/tablet should keep getting security updates for its normal lifetime."" But the new US sanctions do restrict Huawei's ability to get its own chip designs manufactured, which in turn may slow the pace it can make improvements to its hardware. In addition, other restrictions mean new Huawei devices cannot offer Google's services, including its Play Store and smart assistant. Possibly. Vodafone, Three and EE had all begun rolling out 5G services reliant on Huawei's kit nationwide, and they now face having to replace it with equipment from another vendor. Mobile operators are likely to take longer to rollout 5G across the UK as a consequence of the new measures Vodafone and EE had previously indicated that if given less than five years to do so, their customers might face mobile coverage blackouts. But the 2027 deadline gives them more time. However, Mr Dowden acknowledged that a requirement to stop buying new Huawei kit by the end of this year would slow down the wider rollout of 5G by a year. And he added that when one takes into account the 2027 ban and earlier restrictions imposed on the use of the firm's technology, the cumulative delay would be ""two to three years"". That means 5G will remain patchy for longer than it would have done and some parts of the country will have to wait longer to get any access to the next-generation service. Perhaps. In the last election, one of the government's flagship pledges was gigabit connectivity for all by 2025. That involves connecting properties directly to local phone exchanges with fibre - which was already a hugely challenging task to carry out nationwide. As part of its recommendations, NCSC has said that Openreach and other broadband infrastructure providers should stop deploying Huawei's ""fibre access equipment"" - meaning the kit in local exchanges that handles and routes data as it arrives and departs, rather than the internet routers in people's homes. But there is a problem: a present Nokia is the only other supplier of some of the kit involved. And NCSC has warned that the risks involved in a shift to a single vendor outweigh those of continuing to use Huawei for the time being. The government intends to discuss the matter further with operators and hopes at least one other kit provider can be fully substituted for Huawei within two years. But if they struggle to identify one, then security chiefs have explicitly said that once the US sanctions fully kick in, they might be ""unable to gain sufficient assurance in these products to mitigate the risks"". In other words, the UK might have to slow down the rollout of gigabit broadband and miss the government's target. Huawei 5G kit must be removed from UK by 2027 Huawei UK 5G ban 'should happen sooner' UK Huawei decision part of wider strategic tensions with China It's too soon to say, although talk of Â£2bn in added costs do not bode well. In terms of mobile, the Telegraph has reported that the networks are hoping,externalto offset added costs by convincing the government to make it cheaper for them to buy the airwaves necessary to provide 5G services. But if less money flows to the Treasury as a consequence, taxes might have to go up to compensate. In terms of broadband, it depends whether Openreach experiences higher costs of its own in sourcing products from new suppliers, and then feels the needs to pass those onto individual internet service providers (ISPs). One consequence of shunning Huawei is that it might lead the company to rethink its research and development investments in the country. The firm has sponsored work at several universities including Imperial College, London, Southampton and Surrey. In addition, it operates research centres of its own employing a total of 400 people in: Edinburgh Bristol Cambridge Ipswich The company also recently gained planning permission to build a new Â£1bn research centre at Sawston - a large village to the south of Cambridge. It has said thedevelopment would create hundreds of further jobs. But one expert said the new restrictions might not mean the project will be abandoned. ""The research centre in Cambridge has been many years in the planning, and may well be its future sourcing of important technologies within the global supply chain, so Huawei might want to keep it if it is allowed,"" said Emily Taylor from the Chatham House think tank. Mobile networks can be divided into two parts: the core and the radio access network (Ran). The core is likened to the brain and carries out the most sensitive operations, including authenticating users' identities and making sure calls get sent to the right radio tower to connect to another person's phone. The Ran includes the base stations and antennas used to provide a link between individual mobile devices and the core. Insiders sometimes describe this as the ""innovative but dumb"" part of the network. BT's EE mobile network features Huawei in the core of its 4G and 5G networks, but the firm is in the process of replacing it with Ericsson's products, and has promised to do so by the end of 2023. Otherwise, the UK's main mobile providers only use Huawei in the Ran, and then always as part of a mix with at least one other vendor: EE to provide 2G, 4G and 5G Vodafone to provide 2G, 3G, 4G and 5G Three to provide 4G and 5G O2 to provide 5G at a relatively small number of sites in London, where it tested the equipment before opting to go with other suppliers elsewhere Huawei also provides broadband equipment to BT's Openreach division, which owns the infrastructure used by other ISPs, including Plusnet, Sky and TalkTalk. These days, the focus is on rolling out fibre-to-the-premises (FTTP) connections, which offer the fastest speeds and are key to delivering the government's ""gigabit for all"" 2025 pledge. In this case, Openreach uses Huawei's kit at what it calls the ""headend"" - a gateway at local telephone exchanges that converts electrical signals to and from light-based ones, and makes sure each customer's data is sent to the appropriate ISP. Many people still get their internet via slower connections, which are routed via intermediary street cabinets. About 70,000 of these cabinets contain Huawei's kit, and the data also passes through more of the Chinese firm's products at local exchanges. Openreach does not, however, use Huawei's equipment in its core. Elsewhere, CityFibre - which runs its own smaller full-fibre networks - uses some Huawei gear as a legacy of an acquisition, but intends to strip it out by mid-2021. Virgin Media does not use Huawei's equipment within its broadband network. But it does use it to provide telephone services, both for internet-based landline calls as well as to provide mobile phone subscriptions. Other mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) - including Sky Mobile - also use Huawei's gear. It effectively sits between each MVNO and the mobile network whose infrastructure is used, and helps calculate customer bills, among other IT services.

"The government should remove Chinese firm Huawei from the UK's 5G network by 2025 instead of 2027, as planned, ex-Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith has said. The telecoms company is to be banned from setting up 5G, but will remain involved in 3G and 4G. Mr Duncan Smith said allowing Huawei to work on these also posed a continued ""risk"" to national security. But the government said it would ""ensure"" the UK's communications system was as ""secure as it possibly can be"". Huawei, which has repeatedly said itwould not cause harm to any country,predicted the UK would now be pushed ""into the digital slow lane"", with higher bills for consumers. Huawei 5G kit must be removed from UK by 2027 BT: Impossible to ditch Huawei in under 10 years Could Huawei be out of the UK by 2024? In January, ministers announced the company would be kept out of the sensitive core of the 5G network - including national intelligence - but be allowed involvement in up to 35% of other parts. This prompted criticismfrom backbench Conservative MPs,marshalled by Mr Duncan Smith, who called Huawei an arm of the Chinese Communist Party and a risk to the UK. The US, with which the UK shares much of its intelligence, also applied diplomatic pressure for a rethink. Under its revised plans, the government says Huawei willnot be allowed to install any equipment for the 5G networkfrom next year - and its existing equipment will be removed by 2027. But Mr Duncan Smith told the House of Commons that the head of BT thought the removal could happen two years earlier. He said: ""I do think he [Mr Dowden] can do it quicker than this... There's no reason why it can't [happen]."" The government thought it had made its decision on Huawei earlier this year. It wanted to get on with delivering faster internet and thought Huawei was best placed to ensure speedy upgrades. But since then the US has continued to apply pressure - with its decision to impose new sanctions on China a crucial factor. Meanwhile, dozens of Tory backbenchers continued their opposition - and refused to fall in line. They have cautiously welcomed the announcement that the UK is moving away from Huawei - but they want things to move faster. Some are also uneasy that the company's technology will stay in the 3G and 4G network. This decision wasn't without cost though. Ministers admit it will delay the rollout of 5G across the UK and will cost significant amounts of money - into the billions. They've also had to consider warnings from telecoms providers about service provision. Ultimately though, the combination of political pressure - international and domestic - has won the debate in government. Mr Duncan Smith added that there were ""contradictions"" in banning Huawei from 5G but not 3G and 4G, which would undergo ""software upgrades""by Huawei ""for the next decade"". ""So, if they're a risk to us in 5G, why are they not a risk to us generally?"" he asked. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden replied: ""The reality of the 5G network is that it is fundamentally different and it's a recognition of that fundamental difference that we are imposing these rules for 5G. ""Of course, over time... 5G will be replaced by 6G, and in all of that Huawei will be absent."" He also said: ""There is of course no such thing as a perfectly secure network, but the responsibility of the government is to ensure that it is as secure as it possibly can be."" Labour's shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy described the announcement as a ""welcome, long-overdue step"" but accused the government of having ""no consistent approach"" to China. Speaking to the BBC, she said said that, while one department is ""seeking to ban them from the 5G network"", another is ""considering handing over technology involved in our nuclear industry to the Chinese government."" SNP culture spokesman John Nicolson said it had been wrong in the first place to allow Huawei near the ""nervous system"" of the UK's telecoms network. And Labour MP Chris Bryant told the Commons there was ""unity"" among MPs in opposition to the company's further involvement in 5G, saying: ""I wish the government would listen to its own backbenchers."" The US has claimed China coulduse Huawei to ""spy, steal or attack"",externalthe UK - but the company denies this and its founder has said he would rather shut the company down than do anything to damage its clients. Sanctions imposed in May by Washington havelimited China's access to US chip technology, which prompted the UK's National Cyber Security Centre to launch a review of the use of Huawei.

"A Â£4bn cut in VAT has come into force, allowing firms in the food, drink and hospitality sectors to slash prices. Nando's, Pret A Manger and McDonald's are among firms to promise reductions after the chancellor ordered a temporary VAT cut from 20% to 5%. The Treasury estimates households could save Â£160 a year on average, but not all firms will pass on the benefit. Many companies are expected to use the windfall to shore up finances hit by the lockdown, rather than cut prices. The VAT reduction will stay until 12 January next year, Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced last week. It was part of a package of measures to help firms recover and get consumers spending. VAT - Value Added Tax - is paid on everyday goods and services, but the tax is usually included in the price most consumers see. Visitors may not see the thrill of VAT cut Summer Statement: Key points at a glance Several restaurants and food-to-go chains have announced price cuts: Nando's said it would pass on ""100% of the benefits"" from the tax cut to its customers, reducing the price of a quarter chicken by 55p Pret A Manger will cut the price of a takeaway latte by 35p to Â£2.40 from Wednesday, while the price of hot food will be cut from Friday KFC is reducing the price of sharing buckets by Â£1 and slashing the cost of certain ""fan favourites"" by 50p McDonald's is recommending that its franchisees cut prices on an array of products, including the Big Mac, Quarter Pounder and coffee Pub chain Wetherspoon is to reduce prices on meals, coffee and soft drinks, and reduce prices on popular beers Starbucks will pass on the full 15% discount on coffee served in company-operated stores. Other shops and venues with Starbucks licences will be left to pass on whatever reductions suit their business. Value Added Tax, or VAT, is the tax you have to pay when you buy goods or services. The standard rate of VAT in the UK is 20%, with about half the items households spend money on subject to this rate. There is a reduced rate of 5% which applies to some things such as children's car seats and home energy. When you see a price for something in a shop, any VAT will already have been added. There are also various items for which you do not have to pay any VAT, such as most supermarket food, children's clothing, newspapers and magazines. Read more about VAT It is clear that many businesses will not be passing on the reduction. Malcolm Bell, chief executive of Visit Cornwell, said the chancellor's move was to support business, not help holidaymakers. He said some firms had reported tourists calling them to ask for 15% off their holiday booking. ""My message to customers is this is to help the businesses, not to reduce the cost of their holiday. It is only a temporary relaxation up to January."" Many attractions such as museums, parks and zoos, might also not pass on the reduction. Bernard Donoghue, director of the Association of Leading Visitor Attractions (Alva), said he expected the VAT cut would go towards helping venues ""repair their finances as opposed to being passed on to customers"". Alva members were seeing a spike in demand after three months of lockdown, with attractions that offer pre-booked visits ""vastly oversubscribed"", he said. Pub chain Wetherspoon said it would use the tax break to help fund lower prices on some of its most popular beers. However, this move drew criticism from Tom Stainer, chief executive of the Campaign for Real Ale (Camra), and James Calder, chief executive of the Society for Independent Brewers (Siba). ""Like all pubs, Wetherspoon will not be able to benefit from a VAT reduction on beer sales and it is disappointing to see them potentially mislead customers into believing cheaper beer prices are as a direct result of the chancellor's measures,"" he said. Wetherspoon has produced promotional posters to advertise food price cuts, including one called Sunak's Specials and another called Dishi Rishi. Its chairman, Tim Martin, has campaigned for tax equality between pubs, restaurants and supermarkets for many years. He said: ""Supermarkets pay no VAT on food sales and pubs pay 20%. Supermarkets pay about 2p per pint of business rates and pubs pay about 20p. ""A VAT reduction will help pubs and restaurants reverse this trend - creating more jobs, helping high streets and eventually generating more tax income for the government."" But he said that not every hospitality business would be able to reduce prices immediately. ""Some will need to retain the benefit of lower VAT just to stay in business. Others may need to invest in upgrading their premises. ""However, lower VAT and tax equality will eventually lead to lower prices, more employment, busier High Streets and more taxes for the government."" What is VAT and how is it changing?

An investigation into a coronavirus-hit farm in Herefordshire has now been widened to include others in England and Scotland. The total number of positive coronavirus cases linked to the outbreak at AS Green & Co in Mathon now stands at 93, Public Health England (PHE) said. In an update on Wednesday evening, PHE said 76 workers who travelled on to other farms in England came to the UK on the same flight as the Herefordshire farm workers. It added that these 76 people have already been offered testing and no further cases have been identified to date. A further 63 workers who travelled on to Scottish farms were on the same flight. PHE said it has notified public health authorities in Scotland so this groupcan be ""followed-up appropriately"". A group of workers who travelled to the UK by private coach, including some of those who went on to work at AS Green and Co, are also being followed up, it added. Another worker fled the farm, despite being told not to. PHE said the agency that employed the worker (who tested negative for the virus) is in contact with them and has been advised they are self-isolating.Three other workers who fled the farm earlier have been traced. Karen Wright, director of Public Health for Herefordshire, said as testing of workers at the farm continues, officials expect to see the number of cases rise over the coming days ""before social distancing and infection prevention measures start to take effect"". She added that workers have been asked to remain on site and self-isolate to ""reduce risk of spread within the workforce and into the wider community"", and food and essential supplies were being delivered to the farm during this time. She said she knows local residents are concerned, but added the risk to the general public ""remains low"" The group said the Turkish villagers seemed seemed happy to host them Travel plans have been disrupted, borders have been closed and venues of all kinds have been shut during the pandemic.

One member of the four-piece group, Mirjam Ellenbrok, told the BBC they got stuck in the village after the borders suddenly closed along their route.

Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Official Chinese media say that an undisclosed number of customers and delivery personnel have been told to self-isolate in southeastern China after Covid-19 was detected on shrimp containers imported from Ecuador. According to the official CGTN broadcaster, Covid-19 was detected on imported samples in the city of Pingxiang in Jiangxi province. The local government says that âno abnormal situation has been found in the city so farâ to suggest a potential localised outbreak. This is the second time this week that samples of seafood products have tested positive from the South American country. On Monday, the official China Daily said that seafood from three Ecuadorian companies were being pulled from shelves after six samples from inside shipping containers and the outer packaging of shrimp tested positive at customs. Many local governments and online retailers quickly issued suspension orders on these products and said that they were carrying out tests. In recent weeks, Chinese consumers have been nervous about eating seafood, after chopping boards used for imported salmon tested positive at a wholesale market in Beijing. It is believed this led to 335 people being infected across the capital city, and led to Beijing implementing a strict lockdown and aggressive testing procedures. A UK bingo chain has announced the permanent closure of 26 of its halls, putting 573 jobs at risk. Buzz Bingo, which is based in Nottingham, said it had taken the decision due to an ""unsustainable operating environment for the foreseeable future"". Its remaining 91 halls will continue to trade when they reopen from 6 August. Chief executive Chris Matthews said a restructure would ensure those clubs were able to adapt to new coronavirus safety measures and lower customer numbers. Buzz Bingo had to close its sites on 21 March due to the UK government lockdown and furloughed the majority of its staff. The company, which employs about 3,400 people, said it would ""take time"" for footfall at sites to reach pre-virus levels due to social distancing measures and weaker customer confidence.

Sweden's coronavirus containment strategy has been widely criticised Large parts of Swedenâs population are still susceptible to the coronavirus, the countryâs health authorities have said, casting further doubt on the so-called herd immunity strategy. Herd immunity happens when a large proportion of a population develops immunity to a contagious disease, be it through community transmission or vaccination. Sweden has seen far more coronavirus cases than any of its Nordic neighbours, recording 76,492 infections and 5,572 deaths to date,a Johns Hopkins University tally says,external. Sweden did not pursue a full lockdown, instead relying on voluntary social distancing and limited restrictions, such as the banning of large gatherings. The countryâs top epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, has previously expressed hope that herd immunity may be a useful by-product of the strategy, though not its aim. But on Tuesday a senior Swedish health official, Karin Tegmark Wisell, said large parts of Swedenâs population âhavenât been infectedâ by the coronavirus, meaning they are still susceptible. Earlier this month,a study from Spain raised questions about the feasibility of herd immunityas a way of tackling the coronavirus pandemic. Sir Ed Davey is one of two contenders for the leadership of the Liberal Democrat party Acting Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey has said an independent inquiry into the handling of coronavirus in the UK âcanât come soon enough for bereaved families.â Sir Ed said he had called for the inquiry at Prime Ministerâs Questions on Wednesday âbecause thereâs been tens of thousands of deathsâ and the bereaved families âneed to have some answersâ. Earlier todayPrime Minister Boris Johnson committed to ""an independent inquiryinto what happened"" during the UK coronavirus pandemic sometime ""in the future"". Mr Davey said he had since written to the prime minister asking him to âconfirm that it should be an inquiry under the Inquiries Act 2005,â which the acting leader claims would give it âreal teethâ¦ to get to the bottom of the issue"". âWeâve got to get on with it,"" he told the BBC. There have been more than 290,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 45,000 people have died, government figures show. Both case numbers and the death toll has been falling steadily, but concern remains over possible localised spikes in infection. Take a look atthe latest data on confirmed cases in your area. As coronavirus cases continue to climb, particularly in southern US states like Texas and Florida, many school districts are considering a combination of online and in-person learning - though the White House has continued to push for complete reopenings. A newPolitico/Morning Consult poll,externalhas found that a majority of voters do not think schools and daycare should fully open, in-person, this autumn. The poll also found that 65% of voters disagree with President Trump's threat to cut funding for schools that refuse to reopen. Another poll fromNavigator Research,externalon Wednesday said the number of parents who oppose reopening schools has jumped from 31% at the start of June to 51% as of 15 July. On Tuesday,an Axios/Ipsos poll,externalalso reported most parents, including a slim majority of Republicans, say it is risky to reopen schools.

Stitt attended President Trump's controversialrally in Tulsa, Oklahoma,on 20 June, which local health officials have said was likely to have contributed to the city's recent spike in Covid-19 cases. The governor also told reporters he does not plan to make masks mandatory across the state. ""I'm so proud of how we've handled it this far,"" he said of the state's response to the pandemic. Shortly after the announcement, the Oklahoma Department of Health reported 1,075 additional cases - a new single-day record for the state,according to KOCO News,external. Three people who left a coronavirus-hit farm in England's West Midlands have now been traced,a council has said. Vegetable producers A S Green and Co in Mathon, Herefordshire,went into lockdown after testsshowed 74 people had tested positive for Covid-19. Of the three workers who left against advice, one had tested positive. They are all now self-isolating. A joint statement released on Wednesday from Herefordshire Council and Public Health Midlands said: ""Three workers (one of whom tested positive) left the farm despite being asked to remain on site and isolate. ""All three of these individuals have been reached through the agency that secured their employment, and all have confirmed they are self-isolating."" About 200 workers are said to be in quarantine at the site's live-in accommodation. The farm employs a mix of seasonal workers from the UK and abroad. Starbucks and Walmart on Wednesday announced new mask requirements in all  US stores amid Covid-19 surges in a number of regions across the country. Starbucks says facial coverings will be required for patrons and staff in all its cafes as of 15 July. The coffee retailer says it will also limit the number of customers allowed inside to maintain social distancing. Retail giant Walmart will enact a similar policy in its more than 5,000 stores by 20 July, and noted many stores were in regions already under government mandates regarding facial coverings. The company also said employees would receive special training to assist customers. ""We know it may not be possible for everyone to wear a face covering,"" company officials said. ""Our associates will be trained on those exceptions to help reduce friction for the shopper and make the process as easy as possible for everyone."" UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak has defended his job retention bonus scheme after MPs questioned its value for money. The policy - which was announced last week - will see the government pay employers Â£1,000 for every furloughed worker they retain past January. MPs on the Commons Treasury Committee described the scheme as ""badly-timed and poorly-targeted"". But Sunak said he believed it would ""serve as a significant incentive"" to preserve jobs amid the pandemic. Labour's Angela Eagle cautioned that scheme risked spending taxpayers' money for no benefit. ""Surely you could have had less deadweight if you'd have focused support on different sectors, why didn't you do that?"" she asked. But Sunak insisted the scheme ""will and can make a difference"". Kai Wei says people in Beijing have adopted a ""keep calm and carry on"" attitude As countries far and wide cautiously emerge from lockdowns, some places are regrettably heading back into them. From Europe to Australia, Asia to the US, restrictions are being reimposed in areas where coronavirus infections are on the rise again. The Chinese capital, Beijing, was among those places. We spoke to Kai Wei, a 29-year-old resident of the city, who gave us her guide to surviving a second lockdown. Kai's advice was to keep a happiness balance sheet, trying every means to stay entertained and sane. ""Live as normally as possible. And always wear a mask when you can go out!""

So which other countries can you now visit and what do you need to do when you return? Passengers entering the UK from dozens of countries no longer have to quarantine for two weeks thanks to a relaxation of the government's travel quarantine rules on Friday. More than 50 countries - including many popular holiday spots - now pose ''a reduced risk'' from coronavirus, the government says. WalesandNorthern Irelandhave introduced quarantine exemptions for the same countries as England. Scotland is also allowing exemptions, although unlike the other nationsdoes not exempt travellers from Spain, because of concerns about their rate of coronavirus. You can read more here. Another 85 people have died in UK hospitals, care homes and the community after testing positive for coronavirus, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) says. It brings UK deaths to 45,053 under that measure, but the figures do not include all deaths involving Covid-19 across the UK, which are thought to have passed 55,500. The DHSC also said that in the 24-hours up to 09:00 BST on Wednesday, there had been a further 538 lab-confirmed UK cases. Overall, a total of 291,911 cases have been confirmed. Iran has recorded more than 260,000 coronavirus infections Iran has said 140 of its health workers have died with Covid-19 since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. ""We all owe them our lives and to honour them, we must observe health protocols,â said Sima Sadat Lari, an Iranian health ministry official. The country has seen a rapid surge in the number of coronavirus cases recently, after relaxing its lockdown restrictions in mid-April. So far, Iran has recorded 264,561 infections and 13,410 deaths since the start of the pandemic,according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University,external. Health officials have suggested the renewed surge in new infections could be attributed to more testing, and they have said people were ignoring social-distancing rules. On Wednesday Iranian President Hassan Rohani urged people to respect health regulations, in particular social distancing. ""We ask the people to avoid all gatherings and to adapt the way of life to the current situation,â President Hassan Rohani said at a cabinet meeting.

Mike Pompeo has taken a hardline against China during the pandemic The World Health Organizationâs (WHO) inquiry into the coronavirus pandemic will be a âcompletely white-washed investigationâ, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said, as he lashed out at China. Mr Pompeo accused China of failing to disclose information about the coronavirus when the first cases were detected in the city of Wuhan last year. That failure, Mr Pompeo said, had âkilled over 100,000 Americans and âcost the global economy trillions and trillions of dollarsâ. âAnd now it is allowing the World Health Organization to go in to conduct what I am confident will be a completely, a completely white-washed investigation,â Mr Pompeo said at a news conference on Wednesday. Mr Pompeo appears to be referring to an independent inquiry into the global response to the coronavirus pandemic, launched by the WHO earlier this month. Chaired by two former world leaders, the panel will be tasked with analysing responses to the pandemic by member states and the WHO itself. The panel will not, however, look into the origin of the coronavirus, as Mr Pompeo and other world leaders had demanded. Throughout the pandemic, the Trump administration has implicated the WHO in an alleged cover-up by the Chinese in the early stages of the pandemic.

""The business model here is based on volume and we are not getting anything like the volume through and we'll just have to cut our cloth accordingly."" ""We'll have to get enough fat on before the winter and get ourselves through to April,"" adds Mr Henderson. The hotel opened an outdoor marquee in its car park last week and today was able to open indoors too, but social distancing means only half the tables can be used. ""I think people at this stage are more comfortable sitting outside and luckily it is reasonably warm and has been quite popular actually - last week we were quite busy before we were allowed indoors,"" Mr Henderson adds.

The ""Take five for tourism"" appeal asks people across Scotland to support the sector in its ""time of need"". The five actions that could help restart the visitor economy are taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation. With tourism worth more than Â£11.5bn to the Scottish economy and supporting one in 12 jobs, the sector has been devastated by the Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown and travel restrictions.

"The UK's inflation rate rose to 0.6% in June as the coronavirus lockdown began to ease. The Consumer Prices Index (CPI) picked up slightly from May's four-year low of 0.5%,the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.,external Food and alcohol prices fell, but prices for clothing and games rose, the ONS said. Despite the slight increase in the rate, inflation remains below the Bank of England's 2% target. Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician for economic statistics at the ONS, said: ""The inflation rate has increased for the first time this year, but remains low by historical standards. ""Due to the impact of the coronavirus, clothing prices have not followed the usual seasonal pattern this year, with the normal falls due to the start of the summer sales failing to materialise. ""Prices for computer games and consoles have risen, but food prices, particularly vegetables, have fallen."" Inflation has fallen sharply during the coronavirus crisis as consumer demand has slumped. In June, men's clothing in particular rose in price, with increases coming ""across almost the full range"", the ONS said. Women's clothing showed ""a more mixed picture across the different products"", but with the overall effect still upward. Games, toys and hobbies, particularly computer games and computer games consoles, made the biggest contribution to the inflation rise, the ONS said. ""It is possible that prices have been influenced by the coronavirus (Covid-19) lockdown changing the timing of demand and the availability of some items, particularly consoles,"" the ONS added. Inflation is the rate at which the prices for goods and services increase. It's one of the key measures of financial wellbeing because it affects what consumers can buy for their money. If there is inflation, money doesn't go as far. It's expressed as a percentage increase or decrease in prices over time. For example, if the inflation rate for the cost of a litre of petrol is 2% a year, motorists need to spend 2% more at the pump than 12 months earlier. And if wages don't keep up with inflation, purchasing power and the standard of living falls. What is the inflation rate? Since many areas of the economy were completely shut down in June, the ONS said it had to estimate or ""impute"" some of the data. Jeremy Thomson-Cook, chief economist at financial services firm Equals, said the slight increase in the inflation rate was ""a positive sign"", but added that the outlook remained ""messy"". ""Food prices are falling from lockdown levels, clothing demand is out of kilter with typical seasonal patterns, demand for entertainment during lockdown provided a pronounced bump in prices, and the ONS has only been able to log 84% of the normal price quotes due to unavailability,"" he said. ""For now, however, inflation remains low, and both consumers and the Bank of England will be happy with that."" Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said the small rise in inflation was unlikely to be sustained and that deflation was ""around the corner"". ""In fact, by July or August, CPI inflation may have fallen below zero,"" he said. Discounting from retailers and the impact ofChancellor Rishi Sunak's ""eat out to help out"" schemewould push inflation down, he said. Mr Dales said any bout of deflation would last just a few months, but added: ""It will be a few years before the economy is strong enough to raise inflation to the 2% target.""

"An exclusive, weeks-long BBC investigation inside filthy hospitals in South Africa has exposed an extraordinary array of systemic failures showing how exhausted doctors and nurses are overwhelmed with Covid-19 patients and a health service near collapse. With key staff on strike or sick with coronavirus in the Eastern Cape province, nurses are forced to act as cleaners, surgeons are washing their own hospital laundry and there are alarming reports of unborn babies dying in overcrowded and understaffed maternity wards. As doctors, unions and management fight over scarce resources, one senior doctor described the situation as ""an epic failure of a deeply corrupt system"", while another spoke of ""institutional burn-outâ¦ a sense of chronic exploitation, the department of health essentially bankrupt, and a system on its knees with no strategic management"". The revelations come just as South Africa - which held the coronavirus back for months with an early, tough, and economically devastating lockdown - now sees infection rates soar nationwide, prompting President Cyril Ramaphosa to warn that ""the storm is upon us"". The health crisis, focused on the city of Port Elizabeth, raises fundamental questions about how those extra months were used, or wasted, by officials. ""There's a huge amount of fear, and of mental and emotional fatigue. We were working with a skeleton staff even before Covid-19 and now we're down another 30%,"" said Dr John Black. This video can not be played Last year, the BBC found poor conditions in hospitals in South Africa's Eastern Cape province ""Services are starting to crumble under the strain. Covid has opened up all the chronic cracks in the system. It's creating a lot of conflict,"" he said, confirming reports that patients had been ""fighting for oxygen"" supplies in a ward at Livingstone Hospital in Port Elizabeth. Dr Black - one of only two infectious disease specialists in a province with a population of about seven million - was the only doctor in Port Elizabeth who agreed to talk to us on the record, but a dozen nurses and doctors spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing they would lose their jobs if they were identified. At Livingstone Hospital - designated as the main Covid-19 hospital in the district - doctors and nurses described scenes ""like a war situation"" with blood and waste on the floors, a lack of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), oxygen shortages, a severe shortage of ambulances, no ventilation and patients sleeping ""under newspaper"". Rats have also been spotted feeding on dark red hospital waste pouring into an open drain. Hospital cleaning and other staff have at various gone on strikes ""Doctors scrabbled to do the most urgent of surgeries, portering, scrubbing the floors, working with one or two remaining nursing staff. Matrons were washing linen,"" one doctor wrote by email. ""Every day I come to work in fear,"" said a senior nurse who had just finished her shift. ""The [infection] numbers are going up. Every day we've got chaos. There are a lot of pregnant women all over the wards,"" said another nurse. Several doctors said staff had been left deeply traumatised by a recent episode where a maternity ward at Port Elizabeth's Dora Nginza Hospital became so overwhelmed that several mothers and infants died. A flooded corridor at Dora Nginza Hospital ""I was personally involved in the delivery of two dead infants and know there were more. This is very unusual. To have several mummies and babies dying in one week in one hospital is totally unheard of and unacceptable,"" said one medic. They were convinced the deaths were almost certainly the result of severe understaffing, which left many pregnant women waiting for days, sometimes lying in corridors, for urgent surgery. Three other medical officials with knowledge of the relevant wards confirmed the reports of an unusual number of stillborn infants in recent weeks.  The sense of a deepening crisis - also reported by South Africa'sDaily Maverick,external, and other local media - has been compounded by a lack of proper management, which has seen departments turning on each other, and using Covid-19 as an ""opportunity to air every grievance that ever happened"", according to one official. Livingstone Hospital has been without a permanent chief executive officer or management team for a year and a half, after the last team was sacked for alleged corruption. ""We've been rudderless for some time now,"" said Dr Black bemoaning the lack of ""strong leadership"" to stabilise escalating conflicts between different departments at the hospital, and, in particular, with local unions. South Africa's powerful unions have been extremely active in Port Elizabeth during the crisis. Laundry workers, cleaning staff, porters and some nurses have all - at various times - gone on strike. The sudden, union-backed, closure of smaller clinics, in particular, has pushed more patients towards the city's three big hospitals, quickly overloading them. ""We have seen unions shut down hospital after hospital. Each time one staff member or patient tests positive, all staff down tools. While all these union demands are being met, nothing happensâ¦ for up to two weeks,"" one doctor complained. Union officials have vigorously defended their members' actions. ""It's not true at all that we're exploiting the situation,"" said Khaya Sodidi, provincial secretary of the nurses' union, the Democratic Nurses Organisation of South Africa. ""Our nurses are overwhelmed, having to clean floors or cook because kitchen staff are not working. We cannot risk the lives or nurses. They're human beings."" President Cyril Ramphosa is leading the national effort against coronavirus Several doctors defended the strike action, saying that frontline staff had been pushed to the limit, not just by Covid-19, but by years of exploitation. ""I'm grateful to the unions right now. Sometimes they focus on the wrong issues but at least they're highlighting the problems,"" said one senior doctor. Another criticised the repeated closure of community clinics because of ""one or two infections"" as an ""over-reaction,"" but said the situation needed to be put in context. ""[Staff] have been chronically exploited, abused and neglected for years and now they're being asked to do something that could potentially kill them. There's an institutional burn-out,"" said the doctor. There is general agreement among unions and medical staff that the current crisis is the direct result of many years of systematic underfunding, mismanagement and corruption in one of South Africa's most notoriously badly-run provinces. Estimates vary, but Livingstone Hospital is currently fighting the pandemic with about a third of what's considered appropriate staffing numbers. ""We have historic issues of staff-shortages, labour problems, lack of leadership and, sadly, corruption, cronyism, and fiscal mismanagement. Health services were circling the drain for 10 years. Now they've collapsed,"" said Cole Cameron of the Igazi Foundation, a local health non-governmental organisation. Asked about these criticisms, the secretary general of the Eastern Cape's Health Department, Dr Thobile Mbengashe, acknowledged ""a number of very critical structural issues that are really affecting our response"", and said staff were ""anxious, fearfulâ¦ and overwhelmed."" Debunking fake coronavirus stories in Africa Deciding who lives and dies in a Cape Town township China-US rivalry in Africa fuelled by coronavirus How fast is coronavirus spreading in Africa? But he cited historic issues of underfunding dating back to white-minority rule, and insisted that his department was rising to the challenge of Covid-19. ""It's very true that some of our teams are very stretched and actually stressed. But the health system in the Eastern Cape has not collapsed. We've really been building up [for the pandemic] and I think we are still on track and need to be given an opportunity to show we can do this,"" he said. A car manufacturer has built a clinic in Port Elizabeth The provincial government has cited the rapid construction of a giant new coronavirus field clinic in Port Elizabeth by the German car manufacturer, Volkswagen, as a sign of effective public-private partnership. But doctors at Livingstone hospital expressed some scepticism. ""They've got 1,200 beds, but only 200 are oxygenated, and there are currently only enough staff for 30 beds,"" said one doctor, complaining that new staff were now being poached from Livingstone and other hospitals and that the VW facility had been opened before it was ready. The speed with which VW built the facility has, in the eyes of many, simply underlined the provincial government's own failings. Two people with knowledge of the situation confirmed that the provincial health department was generally seen as so inept and dysfunctional that private donors, businesses and charitable funds anxious to help in the fight against Covid-19 were refusing to deal directly with it.  Bought100 ambulance  motorbikes for $600,000 (Â£480,000) Motorbikesfailed to meet criteria to transport patients Billsof $180m unpaid in 2019/2020 financial year Facingmedico-legal claims of nearly $1.8bn this financial year More than50,000 Covid-19 cases and nearly 700 deaths in province ""You can't administer anything through them because it'll go missing. It all boils down to the fact that the department is dysfunctional beyond belief and has no money,"" said one source. As infection numbers rise across much of South Africa, the dire situation in the Eastern Cape offers some important lessons for other provinces. One doctor cited a ""culture of not wanting to discomfort your superiors which means people don't often tell it like it really is. Hygiene conditions are extremely poor at Livingstone Hospital ""People just pretend everything's fine."" Others spoke of a desire by government ""to be seen to be doing the right thing"", rather than making tough decisions, citing the recent decision to resume community testing for Covid-19, despite the fact that it immediately pushed the entire testing system - including, crucially at hospitals - into a week-long backlog that rendered it almost useless. But the clearest lesson from Port Elizabeth may well prove to be about human nature, and how we respond under extreme pressure. It appears that staff at Livingstone hospital, for instance, have split into three distinct groups: There are a small number of the ""willing,"" who still turn up for work, despite the risks, out of a profound sense of duty. ""I can't say I will give up. They are our families, our children, our mothers,"" said one nurse of her patients. There is a second group of people whose fear and frustration has overwhelmed them and who are not prepared to return to work.

"An exclusive, weeks-long BBC investigation inside filthy hospitals in South Africa has exposed an extraordinary array of systemic failures showing how exhausted doctors and nurses are overwhelmed with Covid-19 patients and a health service near collapse. With key staff on strike or sick with coronavirus in the Eastern Cape province, nurses are forced to act as cleaners, surgeons are washing their own hospital laundry and there are alarming reports of unborn babies dying in overcrowded and understaffed maternity wards. As doctors, unions and management fight over scarce resources, one senior doctor described the situation as ""an epic failure of a deeply corrupt system"", while another spoke of ""institutional burn-outâ¦ a sense of chronic exploitation, the department of health essentially bankrupt, and a system on its knees with no strategic management"". The revelations come just as South Africa - which held the coronavirus back for months with an early, tough, and economically devastating lockdown - now sees infection rates soar nationwide, prompting President Cyril Ramaphosa to warn that ""the storm is upon us"". The health crisis, focused on the city of Port Elizabeth, raises fundamental questions about how those extra months were used, or wasted, by officials. ""There's a huge amount of fear, and of mental and emotional fatigue. We were working with a skeleton staff even before Covid-19 and now we're down another 30%,"" said Dr John Black. This video can not be played Last year, the BBC found poor conditions in hospitals in South Africa's Eastern Cape province ""Services are starting to crumble under the strain. Covid has opened up all the chronic cracks in the system. It's creating a lot of conflict,"" he said, confirming reports that patients had been ""fighting for oxygen"" supplies in a ward at Livingstone Hospital in Port Elizabeth. Dr Black - one of only two infectious disease specialists in a province with a population of about seven million - was the only doctor in Port Elizabeth who agreed to talk to us on the record, but a dozen nurses and doctors spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing they would lose their jobs if they were identified. At Livingstone Hospital - designated as the main Covid-19 hospital in the district - doctors and nurses described scenes ""like a war situation"" with blood and waste on the floors, a lack of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), oxygen shortages, a severe shortage of ambulances, no ventilation and patients sleeping ""under newspaper"". Rats have also been spotted feeding on dark red hospital waste pouring into an open drain. Hospital cleaning and other staff have at various gone on strikes ""Doctors scrabbled to do the most urgent of surgeries, portering, scrubbing the floors, working with one or two remaining nursing staff. Matrons were washing linen,"" one doctor wrote by email. ""Every day I come to work in fear,"" said a senior nurse who had just finished her shift. ""The [infection] numbers are going up. Every day we've got chaos. There are a lot of pregnant women all over the wards,"" said another nurse. Several doctors said staff had been left deeply traumatised by a recent episode where a maternity ward at Port Elizabeth's Dora Nginza Hospital became so overwhelmed that several mothers and infants died. A flooded corridor at Dora Nginza Hospital ""I was personally involved in the delivery of two dead infants and know there were more. This is very unusual. To have several mummies and babies dying in one week in one hospital is totally unheard of and unacceptable,"" said one medic. They were convinced the deaths were almost certainly the result of severe understaffing, which left many pregnant women waiting for days, sometimes lying in corridors, for urgent surgery. Three other medical officials with knowledge of the relevant wards confirmed the reports of an unusual number of stillborn infants in recent weeks.  The sense of a deepening crisis - also reported by South Africa'sDaily Maverick,external, and other local media - has been compounded by a lack of proper management, which has seen departments turning on each other, and using Covid-19 as an ""opportunity to air every grievance that ever happened"", according to one official. Livingstone Hospital has been without a permanent chief executive officer or management team for a year and a half, after the last team was sacked for alleged corruption. ""We've been rudderless for some time now,"" said Dr Black bemoaning the lack of ""strong leadership"" to stabilise escalating conflicts between different departments at the hospital, and, in particular, with local unions. South Africa's powerful unions have been extremely active in Port Elizabeth during the crisis. Laundry workers, cleaning staff, porters and some nurses have all - at various times - gone on strike. The sudden, union-backed, closure of smaller clinics, in particular, has pushed more patients towards the city's three big hospitals, quickly overloading them. ""We have seen unions shut down hospital after hospital. Each time one staff member or patient tests positive, all staff down tools. While all these union demands are being met, nothing happensâ¦ for up to two weeks,"" one doctor complained. Union officials have vigorously defended their members' actions. ""It's not true at all that we're exploiting the situation,"" said Khaya Sodidi, provincial secretary of the nurses' union, the Democratic Nurses Organisation of South Africa. ""Our nurses are overwhelmed, having to clean floors or cook because kitchen staff are not working. We cannot risk the lives or nurses. They're human beings."" President Cyril Ramphosa is leading the national effort against coronavirus Several doctors defended the strike action, saying that frontline staff had been pushed to the limit, not just by Covid-19, but by years of exploitation. ""I'm grateful to the unions right now. Sometimes they focus on the wrong issues but at least they're highlighting the problems,"" said one senior doctor. Another criticised the repeated closure of community clinics because of ""one or two infections"" as an ""over-reaction,"" but said the situation needed to be put in context. ""[Staff] have been chronically exploited, abused and neglected for years and now they're being asked to do something that could potentially kill them. There's an institutional burn-out,"" said the doctor. There is general agreement among unions and medical staff that the current crisis is the direct result of many years of systematic underfunding, mismanagement and corruption in one of South Africa's most notoriously badly-run provinces. Estimates vary, but Livingstone Hospital is currently fighting the pandemic with about a third of what's considered appropriate staffing numbers. ""We have historic issues of staff-shortages, labour problems, lack of leadership and, sadly, corruption, cronyism, and fiscal mismanagement. Health services were circling the drain for 10 years. Now they've collapsed,"" said Cole Cameron of the Igazi Foundation, a local health non-governmental organisation. Asked about these criticisms, the secretary general of the Eastern Cape's Health Department, Dr Thobile Mbengashe, acknowledged ""a number of very critical structural issues that are really affecting our response"", and said staff were ""anxious, fearfulâ¦ and overwhelmed."" Debunking fake coronavirus stories in Africa Deciding who lives and dies in a Cape Town township China-US rivalry in Africa fuelled by coronavirus How fast is coronavirus spreading in Africa? But he cited historic issues of underfunding dating back to white-minority rule, and insisted that his department was rising to the challenge of Covid-19. ""It's very true that some of our teams are very stretched and actually stressed. But the health system in the Eastern Cape has not collapsed. We've really been building up [for the pandemic] and I think we are still on track and need to be given an opportunity to show we can do this,"" he said. A car manufacturer has built a clinic in Port Elizabeth The provincial government has cited the rapid construction of a giant new coronavirus field clinic in Port Elizabeth by the German car manufacturer, Volkswagen, as a sign of effective public-private partnership. But doctors at Livingstone hospital expressed some scepticism. ""They've got 1,200 beds, but only 200 are oxygenated, and there are currently only enough staff for 30 beds,"" said one doctor, complaining that new staff were now being poached from Livingstone and other hospitals and that the VW facility had been opened before it was ready. The speed with which VW built the facility has, in the eyes of many, simply underlined the provincial government's own failings. Two people with knowledge of the situation confirmed that the provincial health department was generally seen as so inept and dysfunctional that private donors, businesses and charitable funds anxious to help in the fight against Covid-19 were refusing to deal directly with it.  Bought100 ambulance  motorbikes for $600,000 (Â£480,000) Motorbikesfailed to meet criteria to transport patients Billsof $180m unpaid in 2019/2020 financial year Facingmedico-legal claims of nearly $1.8bn this financial year More than50,000 Covid-19 cases and nearly 700 deaths in province ""You can't administer anything through them because it'll go missing. It all boils down to the fact that the department is dysfunctional beyond belief and has no money,"" said one source. As infection numbers rise across much of South Africa, the dire situation in the Eastern Cape offers some important lessons for other provinces. One doctor cited a ""culture of not wanting to discomfort your superiors which means people don't often tell it like it really is. Hygiene conditions are extremely poor at Livingstone Hospital ""People just pretend everything's fine."" Others spoke of a desire by government ""to be seen to be doing the right thing"", rather than making tough decisions, citing the recent decision to resume community testing for Covid-19, despite the fact that it immediately pushed the entire testing system - including, crucially at hospitals - into a week-long backlog that rendered it almost useless. But the clearest lesson from Port Elizabeth may well prove to be about human nature, and how we respond under extreme pressure. It appears that staff at Livingstone hospital, for instance, have split into three distinct groups: There are a small number of the ""willing,"" who still turn up for work, despite the risks, out of a profound sense of duty. ""I can't say I will give up. They are our families, our children, our mothers,"" said one nurse of her patients. There is a second group of people whose fear and frustration has overwhelmed them and who are not prepared to return to work. ""They're not necessarily unwilling, they're just afraid,"" said a doctor. And then there is a third group. ""The plain obstructive - a huge element, passive or overtly aggressive,"" said another source. For them, any sense ""of altruism, or duty, has gone. It went a long time ago"".

"This video can not be played 'Their freedom has been taken away' US President Donald Trump has signed an order to end preferential economic treatment for Hong Kong, after China enacted a new security law there. Hong Kong would be treated ""the same as mainland China"", Mr Trump said. He also signed a law to impose sanctions on officials who cracked down on rights. China has strongly criticised the move, vowing to take retaliatory action. The US sees the security law as a threat to the freedoms Hong Kong has enjoyed under a 1984 agreement. That special status was agreed between China and Hong Kong's former colonial power, the UK, before sovereignty was returned to Beijing in 1997. The new security law - which outlaws criticism of China's government - is the most sweeping change to the political landscape of Hong Kong since then. This video can not be played Tea, drugs and war: Hong Kong's British history explained Speaking in the Rose Garden on Tuesday, Mr Trump said his executive order would end preferential treatment for Hong Kong. ""No special privileges, no special economic treatment and no export of sensitive technologies,"" said the president, who first announced in May that his administration would begin paring back the territory's special status. He also told reporters he had signed the Hong Kong Autonomy Act, which passed unanimously in Congress earlier this month. ""This law gives my administration powerful new tools to hold responsible the individuals and the entities involved in extinguishing Hong Kong's freedom,"" Mr Trump told the news conference. After being questioned by a journalist, the president said he had no plans to speak to Chinese President Xi Jinping. He also told reporters that ""we hold China fully responsible for concealing the [coronavirus] and unleashing it upon the world"". Mr Trump's own administration is under scrutiny for its response to the pandemic. The US has 3.4 million recorded cases, the highest in the world, and more than 136,000 deaths. The president's policy address digressed into a lengthy political attack on his Democratic presidential challenger, Joe Biden, ranging from trade and immigration to policing and climate change. This video can not be played Many Hong Kong residents are worried the new security law means the ""one country, two systems"" principle no longer exists China's foreign ministry condemned the latest US moves, saying they were a ""gross interference"" in its domestic affairs. In a strongly-worded statement, it said the country would also impose retaliatory sanctions against US individuals and entities to ""safeguard China's legitimate interests"". ""The US attempt to obstruct the implementation of the national security law for Hong Kong will never succeed,"" the statement said. ""We urge the US side to correct its mistakes, refrain from implementing the act and stop interfering in China's internal affairs in any way. China will firmly respond if the US goes ahead."" THE US MOVE:Should US firms be worried about Hong Kong sanctions? RISING TENSIONS:The Hong Kong crisis and the new world order THE NEW LAW:What it is and why Hong Kong is worried WHAT COULD HAPPEN:Life sentences for breaking the law and more ELSEWHERE IN THE REGION:What might happen next in the South China Sea? It was not a matter of if, but when. Scrapping Hong Kong's special status will mean companies based there will now have to evaluate what this means for them. Hong Kong is a re-exporting hub, which means that goods that go through Hong Kong to the US but have come from somewhere else - like China for instance - have avoided the tariffs the US has slapped on China. Now that Hong Kong's special status is gone - mainland Chinese companies may look for another place to send their goods - which would see Hong Kong's port and logistics businesses suffer. And how much of an impact will this have on American and multinational companies using Hong Kong as a regional hub? Well, as one business consultant told me - the structural reasons for why a company would use Hong Kong as a hub are still there - low tax rates, good geographic location, convertibility of currency. But perception is reality - and if the perception is that doing business in Hong Kong has become so much more onerous - why not decamp to mainland China or Singapore instead? Washington-Beijing ties have become increasingly frayed in recent months. With Mr Trump facing an uphill battle for re-election this November, he and Mr Biden have accused each other of being weak on China. On Monday, the administration condemned China's military build-up in the South China Sea, accusing it of bullying neighbours. Last Friday, Mr Trump told reporters on Air Force One that a ""phase two"" trade deal with China was in doubt because of its handling of coronavirus, which he called the ""plague"". This video can not be played Jimmy Lai: China's security law ""spells the death knell for Hong Kong"" The US also officially withdrew last week from the World Health Organization, which Mr Trump had accused of being beholden to China. Last week, too, the Trump administration announced sanctions against Chinese politicians who it says are responsible for human rights violations against Muslim minorities in Xinjiang.

The Tokyo 2020 Olympics in Japan had to be postponed because of Covid-19 American athletes due to compete in the Tokyo Olympics will be provided with additional mental health support after the games were postponed until next year, officials say. United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC) officials said Wednesday that three independent mental health officers would give support to athletes ahead of the competition scheduled for Japan 2021. ""As our world continues to evolve during the challenges of a global pandemic and Games postponement, we want to ensure our athletes have the resources they need to focus on their mental health,"" said Bahati VanPelt, the USOPC chief of athlete services. The International Olympic Committee earlier said it was ""fully committed"" to the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 and had ""multiple scenarios"" for them to take place safely.  An investigation into a coronavirus-hit farm in Herefordshire has now been widened to include others in England and Scotland. The total number of positive coronavirus cases linked to the outbreak at AS Green & Co in Mathon now stands at 93, Public Health England (PHE) said. In an update on Wednesday evening, PHE said 76 workers who travelled on to other farms in England came to the UK on the same flight as the Herefordshire farm workers. It added that these 76 people have already been offered testing and no further cases have been identified to date. A further 63 workers who travelled on to Scottish farms were on the same flight. PHE said it has notified public health authorities in Scotland so this groupcan be ""followed-up appropriately"". A group of workers who travelled to the UK by private coach, including some of those who went on to work at AS Green and Co, are also being followed up, it added. Another worker fled the farm, despite being told not to. PHE said the agency that employed the worker (who tested negative for the virus) is in contact with them and has been advised they are self-isolating.Three other workers who fled the farm earlier have been traced. Karen Wright, director of Public Health for Herefordshire, said as testing of workers at the farm continues, officials expect to see the number of cases rise over the coming days ""before social distancing and infection prevention measures start to take effect"". She added that workers have been asked to remain on site and self-isolate to ""reduce risk of spread within the workforce and into the wider community"", and food and essential supplies were being delivered to the farm during this time. She said she knows local residents are concerned, but added the risk to the general public ""remains low"" The group said the Turkish villagers seemed seemed happy to host them Travel plans have been disrupted, borders have been closed and venues of all kinds have been shut during the pandemic. This posed a perfect storm of problems for a group of young musicians, whose road trip across Asia was brought to a standstill earlier this year. The band, called Tango Maluco, found themselves hunkering down in the most unlikely place - Erenler, a remote village in Turkey's Black Sea region. One member of the four-piece group, Mirjam Ellenbrok, told the BBC they got stuck in the village after the borders suddenly closed along their route. The group has made the most of their time, however, learning from the locals how to cook village specialities and prepare yogurt from cow's milk, while gardening in the lush surroundings.

Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Official Chinese media say that an undisclosed number of customers and delivery personnel have been told to self-isolate in southeastern China after Covid-19 was detected on shrimp containers imported from Ecuador. According to the official CGTN broadcaster, Covid-19 was detected on imported samples in the city of Pingxiang in Jiangxi province. The local government says that âno abnormal situation has been found in the city so farâ to suggest a potential localised outbreak. This is the second time this week that samples of seafood products have tested positive from the South American country. On Monday, the official China Daily said that seafood from three Ecuadorian companies were being pulled from shelves after six samples from inside shipping containers and the outer packaging of shrimp tested positive at customs. Many local governments and online retailers quickly issued suspension orders on these products and said that they were carrying out tests. In recent weeks, Chinese consumers have been nervous about eating seafood, after chopping boards used for imported salmon tested positive at a wholesale market in Beijing. It is believed this led to 335 people being infected across the capital city, and led to Beijing implementing a strict lockdown and aggressive testing procedures. A UK bingo chain has announced the permanent closure of 26 of its halls, putting 573 jobs at risk. Buzz Bingo, which is based in Nottingham, said it had taken the decision due to an ""unsustainable operating environment for the foreseeable future"". Its remaining 91 halls will continue to trade when they reopen from 6 August. Chief executive Chris Matthews said a restructure would ensure those clubs were able to adapt to new coronavirus safety measures and lower customer numbers. Buzz Bingo had to close its sites on 21 March due to the UK government lockdown and furloughed the majority of its staff. The company, which employs about 3,400 people, said it would ""take time"" for footfall at sites to reach pre-virus levels due to social distancing measures and weaker customer confidence.

Sweden's coronavirus containment strategy has been widely criticised Large parts of Swedenâs population are still susceptible to the coronavirus, the countryâs health authorities have said, casting further doubt on the so-called herd immunity strategy. Herd immunity happens when a large proportion of a population develops immunity to a contagious disease, be it through community transmission or vaccination. Sweden has seen far more coronavirus cases than any of its Nordic neighbours, recording 76,492 infections and 5,572 deaths to date,a Johns Hopkins University tally says,external. Sweden did not pursue a full lockdown, instead relying on voluntary social distancing and limited restrictions, such as the banning of large gatherings. The countryâs top epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, has previously expressed hope that herd immunity may be a useful by-product of the strategy, though not its aim. But on Tuesday a senior Swedish health official, Karin Tegmark Wisell, said large parts of Swedenâs population âhavenât been infectedâ by the coronavirus, meaning they are still susceptible. Earlier this month,a study from Spain raised questions about the feasibility of herd immunityas a way of tackling the coronavirus pandemic. Sir Ed Davey is one of two contenders for the leadership of the Liberal Democrat party Acting Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey has said an independent inquiry into the handling of coronavirus in the UK âcanât come soon enough for bereaved families.â Sir Ed said he had called for the inquiry at Prime Ministerâs Questions on Wednesday âbecause thereâs been tens of thousands of deathsâ and the bereaved families âneed to have some answersâ. Earlier todayPrime Minister Boris Johnson committed to ""an independent inquiryinto what happened"" during the UK coronavirus pandemic sometime ""in the future"". Mr Davey said he had since written to the prime minister asking him to âconfirm that it should be an inquiry under the Inquiries Act 2005,â which the acting leader claims would give it âreal teethâ¦ to get to the bottom of the issue"". âWeâve got to get on with it,"" he told the BBC. There have been more than 290,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 45,000 people have died, government figures show. Both case numbers and the death toll has been falling steadily, but concern remains over possible localised spikes in infection. Take a look atthe latest data on confirmed cases in your area. As coronavirus cases continue to climb, particularly in southern US states like Texas and Florida, many school districts are considering a combination of online and in-person learning - though the White House has continued to push for complete reopenings. A newPolitico/Morning Consult poll,externalhas found that a majority of voters do not think schools and daycare should fully open, in-person, this autumn. The poll also found that 65% of voters disagree with President Trump's threat to cut funding for schools that refuse to reopen. Another poll fromNavigator Research,externalon Wednesday said the number of parents who oppose reopening schools has jumped from 31% at the start of June to 51% as of 15 July. On Tuesday,an Axios/Ipsos poll,externalalso reported most parents, including a slim majority of Republicans, say it is risky to reopen schools. Now, a post to make you hungry if you've skipped lunch and are still a while away from dinner. Nando's, Pret A Manger and McDonald's are among the UK food chains to promise reductions in their prices after the chancellor ordered a temporary VAT cut from 20% to 5%. As a reminder, VAT is the tax you pay on everyday goods and services and is usually included in the price most consumers see. Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced the Â£4bn cut in VAT - which will stay in place until 12 January 2021- to help firms recover in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic and get consumers spending. The Treasury estimates households could save Â£160 a year on average, but not all companies will pass on the benefit. Many firms are expected to use the windfall to shore up finances hit by the lockdown rather than cut prices for customers. You can read more here. Governor Kevin Stitt Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt has announced he has tested positive for Covid-19. He is the first governor to publicly announce a virus diagnosis so far, US media report. ""I feel fine, I felt a little bit achy yesterday,"" the Republican governor told reporters. He said is isolating from his family - who have tested negative - and working from home. Stitt attended President Trump's controversialrally in Tulsa, Oklahoma,on 20 June, which local health officials have said was likely to have contributed to the city's recent spike in Covid-19 cases. The governor also told reporters he does not plan to make masks mandatory across the state. ""I'm so proud of how we've handled it this far,"" he said of the state's response to the pandemic. Shortly after the announcement, the Oklahoma Department of Health reported 1,075 additional cases - a new single-day record for the state,according to KOCO News,external. Three people who left a coronavirus-hit farm in England's West Midlands have now been traced,a council has said. Vegetable producers A S Green and Co in Mathon, Herefordshire,went into lockdown after testsshowed 74 people had tested positive for Covid-19. Of the three workers who left against advice, one had tested positive. They are all now self-isolating. A joint statement released on Wednesday from Herefordshire Council and Public Health Midlands said: ""Three workers (one of whom tested positive) left the farm despite being asked to remain on site and isolate. ""All three of these individuals have been reached through the agency that secured their employment, and all have confirmed they are self-isolating."" About 200 workers are said to be in quarantine at the site's live-in accommodation. The farm employs a mix of seasonal workers from the UK and abroad. Starbucks and Walmart on Wednesday announced new mask requirements in all  US stores amid Covid-19 surges in a number of regions across the country. Starbucks says facial coverings will be required for patrons and staff in all its cafes as of 15 July. The coffee retailer says it will also limit the number of customers allowed inside to maintain social distancing. Retail giant Walmart will enact a similar policy in its more than 5,000 stores by 20 July, and noted many stores were in regions already under government mandates regarding facial coverings. The company also said employees would receive special training to assist customers. ""We know it may not be possible for everyone to wear a face covering,"" company officials said. ""Our associates will be trained on those exceptions to help reduce friction for the shopper and make the process as easy as possible for everyone."" UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak has defended his job retention bonus scheme after MPs questioned its value for money. The policy - which was announced last week - will see the government pay employers Â£1,000 for every furloughed worker they retain past January. MPs on the Commons Treasury Committee described the scheme as ""badly-timed and poorly-targeted"". But Sunak said he believed it would ""serve as a significant incentive"" to preserve jobs amid the pandemic. Labour's Angela Eagle cautioned that scheme risked spending taxpayers' money for no benefit. ""Surely you could have had less deadweight if you'd have focused support on different sectors, why didn't you do that?"" she asked. But Sunak insisted the scheme ""will and can make a difference"". Kai Wei says people in Beijing have adopted a ""keep calm and carry on"" attitude As countries far and wide cautiously emerge from lockdowns, some places are regrettably heading back into them. From Europe to Australia, Asia to the US, restrictions are being reimposed in areas where coronavirus infections are on the rise again. The Chinese capital, Beijing, was among those places. We spoke to Kai Wei, a 29-year-old resident of the city, who gave us her guide to surviving a second lockdown. Kai's advice was to keep a happiness balance sheet, trying every means to stay entertained and sane. ""Live as normally as possible. And always wear a mask when you can go out!""

So which other countries can you now visit and what do you need to do when you return? Passengers entering the UK from dozens of countries no longer have to quarantine for two weeks thanks to a relaxation of the government's travel quarantine rules on Friday.

It brings UK deaths to 45,053 under that measure, but the figures do not include all deaths involving Covid-19 across the UK, which are thought to have passed 55,500. The DHSC also said that in the 24-hours up to 09:00 BST on Wednesday, there had been a further 538 lab-confirmed UK cases. Overall, a total of 291,911 cases have been confirmed.

""We all owe them our lives and to honour them, we must observe health protocols,â said Sima Sadat Lari, an Iranian health ministry official. The country has seen a rapid surge in the number of coronavirus cases recently, after relaxing its lockdown restrictions in mid-April. So far, Iran has recorded 264,561 infections and 13,410 deaths since the start of the pandemic,according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University,external.

Read BBC Reality Checkâs latest analysison the Covid-19 situation in Iran. Mike Pompeo has taken a hardline against China during the pandemic The World Health Organizationâs (WHO) inquiry into the coronavirus pandemic will be a âcompletely white-washed investigationâ, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said, as he lashed out at China. Mr Pompeo accused China of failing to disclose information about the coronavirus when the first cases were detected in the city of Wuhan last year. That failure, Mr Pompeo said, had âkilled over 100,000 Americans and âcost the global economy trillions and trillions of dollarsâ. âAnd now it is allowing the World Health Organization to go in to conduct what I am confident will be a completely, a completely white-washed investigation,â Mr Pompeo said at a news conference on Wednesday. Mr Pompeo appears to be referring to an independent inquiry into the global response to the coronavirus pandemic, launched by the WHO earlier this month. Chaired by two former world leaders, the panel will be tasked with analysing responses to the pandemic by member states and the WHO itself. The panel will not, however, look into the origin of the coronavirus, as Mr Pompeo and other world leaders had demanded. Throughout the pandemic, the Trump administration has implicated the WHO in an alleged cover-up by the Chinese in the early stages of the pandemic.
