"This video can not be played Staff leave some of Google's US offices over women's treatment Staff at Google offices around the world have staged an unprecedented series of walkouts in protest at the company's treatment of women. The employees are demanding several key changes in how sexual misconduct allegations are dealt with at the firm, including a call to end forced arbitration - a move which would make it possible for victims to sue. Google chief executive Sundar Pichai has told staff he supports their right to take the action. ""I understand the anger and disappointment that many of you feel,"" he said in an all-staff email. ""I feel it as well, and I am fully committed to making progress on an issue that has persisted for far too long in our societyâ¦ and, yes, here at Google, too."" How US employers silence sex accusers A Twitter feed titled@googlewalkout,externaldocumented the movement at Google's international offices. Google staff in Singapore, Zurich, London, Tokyo, Berlin and New York were among those to take part. Google's headquarters in Mountain View, California New York Dublin London Zurich The first walkout was at Googleâs Singapore office Web developer Sam Dutton, who joined the walkout in London, told the BBC: ""We're walking out to support colleagues in any workplace that have suffered harassment and to ensure that perpetrators aren't protected or rewarded."" Anger has boiled over in the past week,externalsince the New York Times alleged that one high-profile executive received a $90m (Â£69m) payout after he left the firm, despite what Google considered a âcredibleâ allegation of sexual misconduct. Andy Rubin, known as the âcreatorâ of the Android mobile operating system, denies the accusation. On Tuesday, another executive - this time from the companyâs X research lab - also resigned. Richard DeVaul was said to have made unwanted advances towards a woman who was recently interviewed for a job in which she would have reported to him. Mr DeVaul has not commented since his resignation, but has in the past called the incident an ""error of judgement"". At least 48 other employees were sacked for sexual harassment without receiving a payout, Mr Pichai told staff. He admitted the New York Timesâ report had been ""difficult to read"". Staff involved in Thursday's walkout left notes on their desks telling colleagues: ""Iâm not at my desk because Iâm walking out with other Googlers and contractors to protest sexual harassment, misconduct, lack of transparency, and a workplace culture thatâs not working for everyone."" They have also made formal demands to Googleâs management. They are: A commitment to end pay and opportunity inequality A publicly disclosed sexual harassment transparency report A clear, uniform, globally inclusive process for reporting sexual misconduct safely and anonymously The elevation of the chief diversity officer to answer directly to the CEO, and make recommendations directly to the board of directors The appointment of an employee representative to the board An end to forced arbitration in cases of harassment and discrimination for all current and future employees Forced arbitration, a common contract clause for Silicon Valley workers, demands any disputes are dealt with internally rather than through other methods such as the courts. Critics of forced arbitration say it is used to not only protect the reputations of both the company and the accused, but also to silence victims who are unable to appeal against decisions or take further action. ""Employees have raised constructive ideas for how we can improve our policies and our processes going forward,â said Mr Pichai in a statement on Wednesday evening. ""We are taking in all their feedback so we can turn these ideas into action."" Amazon scrapped 'sexist AI' tool Was Google wrong to fire memo author? Uber's mess reaches beyond sexism - and Silicon Valley Are you taking part in the walkout?  Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external Co-ordinated action of this scale is unprecedented at a Silicon Valley company, but follows a trend for increasingly impassioned employee activism. ""Women are fed up, and I don't think it's just women,â said Prof Kellie McElhaney, from the Haas School of Business. ""There are a lot of âmanbassadors' out there who are equally as fed up and using their positions of power and voice, which can cost Google money. I think you have to hit these companies where it hurts. ""I think it empowers other Google offices when women and men are watching this happen, that they can do a similar action that's not just sitting by or making comments to one another or sharing emails."" This leaflet will be left on the desks of Google employees choosing to take part in the coordinated action In the past year, Google employees have spoken out strongly against the companyâs work with the US Department of Defense, as well as plans to re-enter the Chinese market with a search product. The Tech Workers Coalition, a San Francisco-based advocacy group, said the dispute over the treatment of women was just one of several that tech companies need to address. âWe stand in solidarity with the Google workers,â a spokesperson for the group said. âItâs clear the executives wonât do this for us so weâre taking matters into our own hands.""

"Jho Low (right) is seen with Wolf of Wall Street star Leonardo DiCaprio in 2013 Two former Goldman Sachs bankers and Malaysian financier Jho Low have been hit with US criminal charges in connection with one of the world's biggest financial scandals. The Department of Justice alleges,externalthe men participated in a scheme that stole billions of dollars from Malaysia's development fund, 1MDB. One former Goldman banker pleaded guilty, the department said. The other banker has been arrested, while Mr Low remains at large. Mr Low, who prosecutors say had ties to government officials and acted as an informal adviser to the 1MDB fund, maintains his innocence, according to a statement issued by his legal team. He has previously denied charges filed in Malaysia, adding that it would be ""impossible"" for him to receive a fair trial there. ""Mr. Low simply asks that the public keep an open mind regarding this case until all of the evidence comes to light, which he believes will vindicate him,"" the statement said. Goldman, which worked to raise money for the 1MDB fund, said on Thursday that it ""continues to co-operate with all authorities investigating this matter"". These are the first US criminal charges to surface in the 1MDB scandal. Authorities say billions of dollars were embezzled from the state fund to buy art, property, a private jet - and even to help finance the Wolf of Wall Street film starring Leonardo DiCaprio. The scandal has prompted investigations around the world and played a role in the election defeat earlier this year of Malaysia's former prime minister, Najib Razak, who is accused of pocketing $700m (Â£517m) from the fund he set up. He has since been charged with corruption, abuse of power and criminal breach of trust in Malaysia. His wife, Rosmah Mansor, has been charged with money laundering. Both deny any wrongdoing. The US v The Wolf of Wall Street 1MDB: Malaysia's global corruption scandal Malaysia seizes handbags stuffed with cash US authorities have previously filed civil suitsaimed at recovering luxury goods, cash and other items allegedly purchased with money from the fund. In this case, prosecutors say former Goldman bankers Tim Leissner and Roger Ng worked with Mr Low to bribe government officials to win 1MDB business for Goldman Sachs. Goldman had previously rejected Mr Low as a client, after compliance officials raised concerns about the source of his money. But in this case, the bankers, along with others at Goldman, worked to conceal Mr Low's involvement, prosecutors say. Ultimately, the bankers worked on three bond offerings in 2012 and 2013 that raised about $6.5bn for the fund and earned Goldman $600m, the indictment says. The money was supposed to support development projects, but prosecutors say the three men ""conspired to launder"" more than $2.7bn through the US financial system. They allegedly used this money to pay bribes and ""for the personal benefit of themselves and their relatives"". Raids on properties linked to Mr Najib uncovered luxury goods worth millions of dollars Mr Low, who was charged earlier in Malaysia, has repeatedly declared his innocence.,externalHe has called the Malaysian charges political. Mr Leissner, who served as Goldman's South East Asia chairman and a participating managing director, has pleaded guilty to conspiring to launder money and violate US anti-bribery laws. Mr Leissner, who left Goldman in February 2016, has been ordered to forfeit $43.7m. Mr Ng was a managing director at Goldman until his departure in May 2014. He was arrested in Malaysia on Thursday. The BBC has not yet been able to contact a lawyer representing him.

"Palau is set to become the first country to impose a widespread ban on sunscreen in an effort to protect its vulnerable coral reefs. The government has signed a law that restricts the sale and use of sunscreen and skincare products that contain a list of ten different chemicals. Researchers believe that these ingredients are highly toxic to marine life, and can make coral more susceptible to bleaching. The ban comes into force in 2020. In a statement, Palau's President Tommy Remengesau said the ban, which would see fines of $1,000 (Â£760) for retailers who violated the law, was timely. ""The power to confiscate sunscreens should be enough to deter their non-commercial use, and these provisions walk a smart balance between educating tourists and scaring them away."" Reality Check: How does sunscreen work? Water resistant sunscreen claims 'don't wash' Scientists have been raising concerns about the impacts of sunscreen products on marine life for many years. They are particularly worried over the role of two ingredients called oxybenzone and octinoxate.  These are used as sun protection factors as they absorb ultraviolet light. However, they are believed to make coral more susceptible to bleaching. Researchpublished in 2015,externalshowed that the oxybenzone could stunt the growth of baby corals and was toxic to several different coral species in laboratory tests. ""Oxybenxzone is probably the baddest actor out of the 10 chemicals that have been banned,"" said Dr Craig Downs, an expert on the impacts of sunscreens on marine life. ""It causes corals to bleach at lower temperatures, and it reduces their resilience to climate change."" Dr Downs says that when there's a disastrous event likemass coral bleaching, reefs should recover over the following years. That has not been happening in many parts of the world. A diver among the corals in Palau ""Life doesn't scramble back in where there are tourists,"" said Dr Downs. ""The juvenile phase of coral are more susceptible to chemical pollution than adults. That's why we see these areas not coming back."" ""They are coral reef zombies. Only the adults are left and it's only a matter of time before they go."" Researchers say that the biggest threat to coral reefs is climate change, with estimates that 90% of reefs will succumb to rising temperatures by 2050. The second biggest threat is the suffocating threat posed by algal blooms, triggered by the runoff of nutrients from sewage and farming. Sunscreen is now seen as one of a number of other, lesser threats including ocean acidification. Sunscreen has already been banned at Jellyfish Lake in Palau It has been estimated that between 6-14,000 tonnes of sunscreen wash off people and go into reef areas every year. Researchers say that several thousand sun protection products contain the two most threatening chemicals. Five years ago it was estimated to be in around 75% of products. Experts now say it's found in about half of creams and lotions. Right now the US Congress is looking at legislation to ban oxybenzone, based on the threat it poses to human health. Palau is located in the western part of the Pacific ocean. It is made up of one large volcanic island and several smaller coral reef associated islands. Despite its small size, it has often taken big steps in protecting the environment. In 2015, it designated almost its entire ocean territory as a marine protected zone. Very aware of the threats of climate change, Palau became the second nation in the world after Fiji to ratify the Paris climate agreement in 2016. When it comes to coral reefs, the island nation has largely avoided the negative impacts of extensive coastal erosion from agriculture, pollution and rampant overfishing that have affected reefs elsewhere. The ban on sunscreen products means Palau is determined to fight any threat to the reefs, which are visited by thousands of tourists every year. Prof JÃ¶rg Wiedenmann, who studies coral ecosystems at the University of Southampton, UK, said: ""It is a sensible precaution to prevent the exposure of the vulnerable corals from the potential threats by sunscreen products in these places. ""However, reefs cannot be saved by banning sunscreens alone. There are more destructive drivers of reef decline such as sea water warming, overfishing, nutrient enrichment and pollution that need to be controlled to halt the ongoing degradation of reef ecosystems."" Yes - several regions have imposed bans, including the island of Bonaire in the Caribbean and the US state of Hawaii which passed a law earlier this year. Mexico has banned sunscreen in nature reserves. A view of some of the islands that make up Palau The Palau restriction is set to be the most comprehensive yet, covering 10 chemicals. They include four that have an antimicrobial effect but have also been shown in the scientific literature to act as endocrine disruptors. Experts say that dozens of other countries may now look to replicate the Palau ban. Yes, there are alternatives that don't include the two key chemicals that are being marketed as ""reef-safe"". But some scientists argue that the term is not legally enforceable, and there is no compulsion on manufacturers to demonstrate that their products don't harm coral. Dr Craig Downs says the first line of protection against the sun should be clothing with built-in sun protection. ""From a conservation point of view, if you wear a sun shirt, you are reducing the sunscreen load by 50%. That's a major conservation victory."" Another approach would be to use mineral-based sunscreen, such as non-nanosized titanium oxide or zinc oxide. Many of the larger corporations are against a ban on sunscreen products, saying that the evidence of a detrimental impact on coral is not strong enough. ""The big boys are fighting it. Johnson & Johnson and L'Oreal don't seem to be on board,"" said Dr Downs. ""But much of the rest of the industry have already come out with what they are calling 'Hawaii-compliant sunscreen', and it is a big marketing boost for them."" A group of manufacturers have formed what they call the Safe Sunscreen Council. They welcomed the move. ""Palau's move to ban ingredients that have been know to cause damage to coral reefs is the right things to do,"" said Caroline Duell from the council. ""Hopefully, by Palau taking leadership on this issue, not only will they protect their sacred and economically key coral reef network, but they will show the world that it's time to change the way we think.  There are many alternatives for sunscreen and personal care products that are safe, effective and enjoyable to use.""

"James ""Whitey"" Bulger A convicted mafia hitman serving a life sentence for murder is reportedly the prime suspect in the killing of Boston gangster James ""Whitey"" Bulger. Multiple law enforcement sources tell US media that Fotios ""Freddy"" Geas, 51, and other inmates savagely beat Bulger with a lock inside a sock on Tuesday. The 89-year-old's death came less than 12 hours after he was transferred to a federal prison in West Virginia. Bulger was jailed in 2011 after a 16-year international manhunt. The FBI has launched an investigation into the suspected homicide, and several convicts at the prison have reportedly been placed in solitary confinement for their roles in the attack. Gangster 'Whitey' Bulger killed in prison Geas's lawyer has described him as a ""stand-up guy"" who loathed informants such as Bulger. Bulger had been an FBI turncoat for years, and used his position to inform on rivals while committing at least 11 murders against his enemies. Unnamed prison officials have told US media that Bulger, who used a wheelchair, was pushed by the inmates into a corner of his cell not in the view of  security cameras. But despite their efforts to hide, CCTV cameras captured at least two inmates engaging in the attack that left Bulger bloody and ""unrecognisable"",according to the New York Times,external. Profile: James 'Whitey' Bulger James 'Whitey' Bulger's IRA links Officials say a metal padlock tucked into a sock  - known in prisons as a ""lock-in-the-sock"" - was wielded like a mace during the attack. According to several reports, Bulger's eyes had been gouged out, or possibly detached from his skull due to the force of the beating he received. His tongue also may have been cut out, several US outlets have reported. The FBI has so far refused to comment on Bulger's death. Whitey Bulger's mugshot taken upon arrival at Alcatraz in 1959 Daniel D Kelly, a lawyer who has represented Geas for years, told the Times that the convicted New England hitman ""has a particular distaste for co-operators"". He added that Geas' feelings were so strong that during his trial for the 2003 murder of the leader of the Genovese crime family in Springfield, Massachusetts, he rejected a plea deal that would have allowed him to avoid a life sentence. His father told NBC News,externalthat he does not believe his son committed the attack. ""That's not his type of thing to do,"" said Fotios Geas Sr. On Tuesday, Bulger's attorney JW Carney Jr  blamed the government for failing to protect his client, saying Bulger ""was sentenced to life in prison, but as a result of decisions by the Federal Bureau of Prisons, that sentence has been changed to the death penalty"". A former Boston police official told the Times that he could not understand why prison guards had not kept Bulger ""away from a convicted organised crime hit man from Massachusetts"". ""I'm not surprised that he got hit; I'm surprised that they let him get hit,"" said Ed Davis, the former Boston police commissioner. Meanwhile, the families of Bulger's victims have not tried to hide their celebrations. ""He died the way I hoped he always was going to die,"" Steven Davis, the brother of Debra Davis who Bulger is said to have strangled to death, told the Boston Globe. Tommy Donahue, whose father was killed by Bulger, told WFXT-TV that he was ""overwhelmed with joy"" at the news. His mother, Patricia Donahue, said she planned to ""open up a champagne bottle and celebrate"". ""The guy that did this, I would go put money in his canteen account,"" Mr Donahue told Boston 25 News.

"Simon Hurwood befriended vulnerable women and requested nude photographs and videos A former police inspector who targeted junior colleagues for sex committed gross misconduct, a panel has ruled. Ex-Cleveland Police Det Insp Simon Hurwood used ""coercive behaviour"" and sent thousands of messages to 21 women over a 14-year period. The force said he had ""acted shamefully"" and praised the bravery of the anonymous whistleblower. Hurwood, 53, who resigned in September after 27 years of service, had denied any wrongdoing. A disciplinary hearing in Middlesbrough upheld eight allegations of gross misconduct and eight more of misconduct. Hurwoodpreyed upon younger women who were having problems in their personal livesand had full sexual contact with four of them, the panel was told. Latest updates from North East England In a statement, one woman described how Hurwood ""coerced"" her into performing sex acts on him in police vehicles and an inspector's office. She said she feared she would ""probably"" lose her job if she reported it. Another said Hurwood persuaded her to have sex with him in an office while they were on duty. Cleveland chief constable Mike Veale said the force would ""not tolerate anyone at any rank abusing their position of authority and trust"". He added: ""For more than a decade he [Hurwood] acted shamefully and was confronted thanks to a brave individual coming forward and blowing the whistle on him."" A member of the force since 1991, Hurwood went on to work in its professional standards department. However, he treated it as a ""personal recruitment centre"" for his own sexual gratification, panel chairman Simon Mallett said. Towards the end of his time there he ""was out of control"" in his ""unfettered pursuit of young women"". Mr Mallett said his behaviour amounted to ""grooming over time"". When he had previously been challenged about his behaviour, Hurwood had ""laughed off"" allegations put to him and no action had been taken. The panel concluded he would have been dismissed without notice if he had still been a serving officer and he will be added to a list barring him from rejoining the profession. The former policeman was not represented nor present at the hearing. When questioned at the outset of the investigation, he said sex with one complainant had been consensual while other allegations were ""cruel nonsense"". In March, Hurwood was arrested for sexual assault offences and suspended from duty. However, it was decided there was insufficient evidence to pursue a criminal prosecution or misconduct in public office charge.

"Charlotte Caldwell previously said the law change would mean her son, Billy, would be able to live a ""normal life"" Medicinal cannabis products can now be legally prescribed to some patients across the UK for the first time. The treatments can be prescribed only by specialist doctors in a limited number of circumstances where other medicines have failed. The decision to relax the rules on the treatments followed an outcry over two boys with severe epilepsy being denied access to cannabis oil. But one charity fears access to it will be ""much more limited"" than expected. Is the UK the world's biggest exporter of legal cannabis? What are the rules about cannabis oil in the UK? Among those who stand to benefit will be children with rare, severe forms of epilepsy. This video can not be played Cannabis-derived medicines: What you need to know As of Thursday cannabis-based products can be prescribed, but only by specialist hospital doctors in a small number of cases, and not by GPs. New NHS guidance for doctors in England,externalsays it should be prescribed only when there is clear published evidence of its benefit and other treatment options have been exhausted. The treatments can be prescribed in cases of Children with rare, severe forms of epilepsy Adults with vomiting or nausea caused by chemotherapy Adults with muscle stiffness caused by multiple sclerosis If a patient is not already in touch with a specialist doctor they can be referred to one by their GP if the doctor deems this appropriate. Billy Caldwell and Alfie Dingley were granted licences to allow them access to cannabis oil The Home Office has said the treatments must have been produced for medical use and be regulated. In practice, experts say this is likely to include pills, capsules and oils, but not smoking cannabis. Treatments contain varying quantities and ratios of the compounds THC, which makes people feel ""high"", and CBD, another compound scientists are investigating for its potential medical benefits. It will be down to individual hospital trusts to decide how to fund the treatments. The decision to allow specialist doctors to prescribe medicinal cannabis products follows the high-profile cases of Alfie seven, and Billy, 13. Both have severe epilepsy which their families say has been markedly improved by cannabis oil treatments that had not been legally available in the UK. Initially, theHome Office refused requests for a licencefor Alfie to use the oil. Billy's mother, Charlotte, hadcannabis oil that she brought back from Canada confiscated at Heathrow Airport. Their plight prompted MPs tocriticise the ""bizarre and cruel"" rules over medicinal cannabis. The boys have since been granted special licences to access their treatments. The cases prompted Home Secretary Sajid Javid to announce in June that there would be a review of medicinal cannabis. That review, which came in two parts, concluded there was evidence medicinal cannabis had therapeutic benefits and that doctors should be able to prescribe the products, provided they met safety standards. In July Mr Javid confirmed that specialists doctors would be able to prescribe cannabis-derived medicinal products. Before today, almost all cannabis-based medicinal products were classed as Schedule One drugs, which means they were judged to have no therapeutic value. Sativex, a treatment containing the cannabis compounds THC and CBD, is one of the few that is already approved. This meant these products could not be legally prescribed in the UK, and could be accessed only, in rare cases, with a special licence from the Home Office. Now treatments that meet ""appropriate standards"" have been reclassified into Schedule Two - those that have a potential medical use. The government says this is not a first step towards legalisation of recreational cannabis use, as in Canada Alfie Dingley's mum, Hannah Deacon, said the guidelines meant people would struggle to access the oil her son had been given because scientific studies had not been carried out on the treatment. ""It's absolutely gutting and not what my campaign was about."" Emma Appleby, whose nine-year-old daughter, Teagan, has severe epilepsy, said it was not clear when she will receive medical cannabis. She also said the guidelines suggested Teagan would be given a weaker form of treatment than doctors had initially suggested to her. She said: ""It's heart-breaking to watch your child suffer every single day, knowing there's a product that can help, could help... ""Watching my daughter suffer every day, it's horrible."" Dr Michael Bloomfield, from University College London, said the UK's approach was sensible. ""It's going to be very hard for doctors to prescribe cannabis-related products to begin with, and I think it's right that's the case. ""When we don't have very strong evidence for any medicine, then it should be hard to prescribe something because we should be prescribing medicines when there's a very strong evidence base for them."" But the MS Society said the guidance made access to treatments ""much more limited than we were led to believe"". Genevieve Edwards, from the society, added: ""We're calling on NHS England to revisit this guidance urgently, and engage with neurological experts to ensure people with MS are not left disappointed and unable to access the right treatment for them."" The government has been quick to say that this is not a first step towards legalising cannabis. Last monthCanada became only the second country in the world, after Uruguay, to legalise possession and use of recreational cannabis. ""There will be strict controls in place and this is in no way a step towards legalising the recreational use of cannabis,"" Home Secretary Sajid Javid has previously said.

"President Donald Trump speaks during a campaign rally to help Republican candidates running in the upcoming election US President Donald Trump says he always tries to tell the truth when he can, despite how the media portrays him. ""I do try,"" he told ABC News in an interview aired on Thursday. ""I always want to tell the truth. When I can, I tell the truth."" Mr Trump has faced repeated criticism from US media and opponents for lying and distorting the truth around issues. At times, conservatives have also censured the president for his claims. ""Sometimes it turns out to be where something happens that's different or there's a change, but I always like to be truthful,""Mr Trump told ABC's Jonathan Karl,external. The president also mentioned he was ""pretty good"" at estimating crowds during his interview, though one of the first times he clashed with the media was overthe size of his inauguration crowd. Since the start of his presidency, US media including the New York Times, Washington Post and Politifact have all kept running tallies of what they term Mr Trump's lies and misleading statements. Politifact, which is owned by the non-profit Poynter Institute, currently has 11 pages on Mr Trump's false statements. TheWashington Post says the president has made 6,420 false or misleading claims over 649 days,external. These, for instance, include repeated assertions about the opposition Democrats' stance on immigration and border controls, the origins of the Russia probe that centres on alleged collusion during the US presidential election campaign, and levels of spending by US allies of Nato. Mr Trump has not escaped criticism from conservatives either over his questionable remarks. Most recently, top Republican Paul Ryan was one of several Republicans to call into questionthe president's assertion that he could amend the constitution with an executive order. During a Wednesday rally in Florida, ahead of next week's mid-term elections, Mr Trump re-launched his assault on US media, saying a third of Americans believed that the media was ""the enemy of the people"". Why Trump attacks the media How 'enemies' remark echoes tyrants This video can not be played The US president said a third of Americans believed ""fake news"" media was ""the enemy of the people"" He did not provide a source for this figure, but one poll from earlier this year showed thatjust under a third of people agreed with the idea that the media is the enemy of the people.,external Critics accuse him of fomenting violence by using extreme and divisive rhetoric against opponents, the media, immigrants and Muslims. Mr Trump has regularly accused some sections of the media of misrepresenting his administration's work. In Julythe publisher of the New York Times urged him to stop calling reporters ""enemies of the people"", saying it would ""lead to violence"" against the media. Mr Trump's remarks come asa new NPR/PBS/Marist poll shows around 80% of voters are concerned,externalthat the lack of civility in Washington will incite violence. While the overall numbers show 40% believe the president is to blame, along party lines, the figures differ as expected. Only 7% of Republicans place the blame on the president, compared to 71% of Democrats. Republicans in turn blame Democrats, 44%, and the media, 42%. But 45% of independent voters say Mr Trump remains the chief cause of the nationwide negative tone. A young participant gestures during a campaign rally with President Donald Trump in Estero, Florida On Wednesday, Mr Trump pinned a divisive campaign ad to his Twitter account that blamed Democrats for ""letting in"" criminals. The video highlights Luis Bracamontes, an undocumented immigrant from Mexico who killed two police officers in California in 2014. It then shows images of the migrant caravan and asks: ""Who else would Democrats let in?"" Trump's immigration ad draws criticism Democrats were quick to criticise the racially-charged ad, with Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez telling CNN the ad showed ""distracting, divisive Donald at his worst"". Recent days have seen the president escalate his rhetoric on immigration in an apparent effort to bolster his base with five days to go before the mid-term elections. Voters are choosing new members of Congress, but how they vote will affect how the rest of Mr Trump's presidency turns out. Both houses of Congress are currently controlled by Mr Trump's Republican Party. A really simple guide to the US mid-terms Are people being barred from voting in US? The Democrats hope to win control of the House of Representatives next week. Doing so would let them block or delay the president's agenda. Some opinion polls put the Democrats ahead in many places.

"Sener Macit says he was convinced he and his wife were going to die A couple who managed to escape Grenfell Tower were told by a 999 operator that no-one could get to them - 40 minutes after being told help was on the way. Sener Macit said he and his wife Hanife ignored calls from family ""begging"" them to leave the building after being assured they would be rescued. They were told to lie on the floor but after 40 minutes passed he said he thought they were ""going to die"". Mr Macit said what he thought were his final goodbyes to his family, he added. On Thursday, the grandfather gave evidence to the public inquiry into the Grenfell Tower disaster, which took place on 14 June last year and killed 72 people. Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? Mr Macit and his wife, who have three children, had lived on the 16th floor of the building since 1992. On the night of the fire they were told to escape by their family but he thought it was ""impossible"" because of the thick smoke. ""I told family members, such as my daughter Merve, who was outside, that I loved them and I said my last goodbye to them. ""They were crying on the phone."" He made another 999 call and he said the operator, who sounded as if she was about to cry, told him: ""Sir, no help can get to you. Please try and get out of the building."" Mr Macit, 57, wrote in his statement that when he and his wife made it to the stairwell the smoke was ""toxic"" and tasted ""poisonous"". When they reached the 14th floor, he said he began ""stepping on bodies"". ""I couldn't see them because of the smoke so I cannot say who they were or describe what they looked like but I know it was people I was stepping on."" Recalling the intense heat, Mr Macit said: ""As a result of this, my wife's eyes stuck and she couldn't open then for three days."" He said that two of his neighbours who had lived on the same floor had died in the fire. ""I know that my wife and I were lucky to survive,"" he said. ""At the time, I truly believed that we were going to die in the tower and I said my goodbyes to my family. ""I won't ever forget what we went through that night. It is a miracle that Hanife and I are alive."" Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims?

"This video can not be played Staff leave some of Google's US offices over women's treatment Staff at Google offices around the world have staged an unprecedented series of walkouts in protest at the company's treatment of women. The employees are demanding several key changes in how sexual misconduct allegations are dealt with at the firm, including a call to end forced arbitration - a move which would make it possible for victims to sue. Google chief executive Sundar Pichai has told staff he supports their right to take the action. ""I understand the anger and disappointment that many of you feel,"" he said in an all-staff email. ""I feel it as well, and I am fully committed to making progress on an issue that has persisted for far too long in our societyâ¦ and, yes, here at Google, too."" How US employers silence sex accusers A Twitter feed titled@googlewalkout,externaldocumented the movement at Google's international offices. Google staff in Singapore, Zurich, London, Tokyo, Berlin and New York were among those to take part. Google's headquarters in Mountain View, California New York Dublin London Zurich The first walkout was at Googleâs Singapore office Web developer Sam Dutton, who joined the walkout in London, told the BBC: ""We're walking out to support colleagues in any workplace that have suffered harassment and to ensure that perpetrators aren't protected or rewarded."" Anger has boiled over in the past week,externalsince the New York Times alleged that one high-profile executive received a $90m (Â£69m) payout after he left the firm, despite what Google considered a âcredibleâ allegation of sexual misconduct. Andy Rubin, known as the âcreatorâ of the Android mobile operating system, denies the accusation. On Tuesday, another executive - this time from the companyâs X research lab - also resigned. Richard DeVaul was said to have made unwanted advances towards a woman who was recently interviewed for a job in which she would have reported to him. Mr DeVaul has not commented since his resignation, but has in the past called the incident an ""error of judgement"". At least 48 other employees were sacked for sexual harassment without receiving a payout, Mr Pichai told staff. He admitted the New York Timesâ report had been ""difficult to read"". Staff involved in Thursday's walkout left notes on their desks telling colleagues: ""Iâm not at my desk because Iâm walking out with other Googlers and contractors to protest sexual harassment, misconduct, lack of transparency, and a workplace culture thatâs not working for everyone."" They have also made formal demands to Googleâs management. They are: A commitment to end pay and opportunity inequality A publicly disclosed sexual harassment transparency report A clear, uniform, globally inclusive process for reporting sexual misconduct safely and anonymously The elevation of the chief diversity officer to answer directly to the CEO, and make recommendations directly to the board of directors The appointment of an employee representative to the board An end to forced arbitration in cases of harassment and discrimination for all current and future employees Forced arbitration, a common contract clause for Silicon Valley workers, demands any disputes are dealt with internally rather than through other methods such as the courts. Critics of forced arbitration say it is used to not only protect the reputations of both the company and the accused, but also to silence victims who are unable to appeal against decisions or take further action. ""Employees have raised constructive ideas for how we can improve our policies and our processes going forward,â said Mr Pichai in a statement on Wednesday evening. ""We are taking in all their feedback so we can turn these ideas into action."" Amazon scrapped 'sexist AI' tool Was Google wrong to fire memo author? Uber's mess reaches beyond sexism - and Silicon Valley Are you taking part in the walkout?  Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external Co-ordinated action of this scale is unprecedented at a Silicon Valley company, but follows a trend for increasingly impassioned employee activism. ""Women are fed up, and I don't think it's just women,â said Prof Kellie McElhaney, from the Haas School of Business. ""There are a lot of âmanbassadors' out there who are equally as fed up and using their positions of power and voice, which can cost Google money. I think you have to hit these companies where it hurts. ""I think it empowers other Google offices when women and men are watching this happen, that they can do a similar action that's not just sitting by or making comments to one another or sharing emails."" This leaflet will be left on the desks of Google employees choosing to take part in the coordinated action In the past year, Google employees have spoken out strongly against the companyâs work with the US Department of Defense, as well as plans to re-enter the Chinese market with a search product. The Tech Workers Coalition, a San Francisco-based advocacy group, said the dispute over the treatment of women was just one of several that tech companies need to address. âWe stand in solidarity with the Google workers,â a spokesperson for the group said. âItâs clear the executives wonât do this for us so weâre taking matters into our own hands.""

"This video can not be played 'We are all numb with sadness and shock' - Leicester manager Leicester manager Claude Puel says the result is ""not important"" when they play Cardiff on Saturday - their first match since the club's owner died in a helicopter crash at the weekend. Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha and four others were killed in the crash outside King Power Stadium on Saturday. Puel says it was the Leicester players' decision to go ahead with the Premier League match in Cardiff. ""Playing football has not been at the front of our minds this week,"" he said. ""But for this weekend, and all the matches thereafter, we play to honour a man who did so much for our club.

I'm confident after I saw my players at training that they can give their best."" Leicester goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel was one of the first players on the scene after the helicopter crashed. ""He lives this situation and he saw a lot of things,"" says Puel. ""Kasper, like the other players, has a lot of history with the chairman and they are all devastated.

"This video can not be played 'Brilliant' Biles wins historic fourth world title Simone Biles made history by becoming the first woman to win four all-around titles at the World Championships. Biles had not competed internationally since the 2016 Olympics, while she revealed in January she hadbeen sexually abusedby a former Team USA sports doctor. In addition, the 21-year-old American wasadmitted to hospitalwith a kidney stone on the eve of the Worlds. ""This is definitely the scariest one from the ones from the past,"" she said. Biles had previously shared the record of three all-around world golds with Svetlana Khorkina of Russia. ""This year has definitely had its ups and downs, going to therapy and other things besides. Just being in the gym has been a little bit rough, but you try to focus on one thing at a time to get through it,"" she said. ""I hope this gives confidence [to other women] that you can still do well and not be penalised for it and for parents to put gymnasts in the sport and feel comfortable."" Britain's Ellie Downie, 19, finished 11th on her return to competition after two operations on her left ankle. On Saturday, Downie takes part in the uneven bars final, while double Olympic champion Max Whitlock will aim to win a third successive world title on the pommel horse. Biles had errors on vault, beam and floor but her total of 57.491 was enough to beat Japan's Mai Murakami into silver and USA's Morgan Hurd into third. A backward roll on landing on vault and a fall off the beam left her almost three full marks down on her qualifying scores. Uneven bars was the Olympic champion's cleanest routine, despite it traditionally being her weakest discipline. Going last on the floor she needed a score of 13.307 to overcome Murakami to take gold and, even with a step out of bounds, Biles scored 15.00 to seal the title by 1.693 marks. ""I wish I could have put out a better performance because that's not the gymnast that I am,"" added Biles, whowon four gold medalsat the 2016 Olympics. ""But we all make mistakes and fall - it's just how you get up and prove yourself."" Biles helped the United States to an emphatic women's team gold earlier in the week and her latest victory saw her win a 12th world title. She has earned 15 World Championships medals, which is five behind the record holder, Khorkina.

"A Japanese pilot who was arrested at Heathrow Airport for being drunk has admitted being more than nine times the legal alcohol limit. Katsutoshi Jitsukawa, 42, who works for Japan Airlines, was arrested on 28 October after failing a breath test. He was found to have 189mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood in his system - the legal limit for a pilot is 20mg. The first officer pleaded guilty to exceeding the alcohol limit at Uxbridge Magistrates' Court on Thursday. Japanese broadcaster NHK reported that police were alerted by the driver of a crew bus who smelled alcohol on the pilot. He had been due to be part of a crew flying a Japan Airlines (JAL) flight JL44 to Tokyo but failed a breath test 50 minutes before the departure time. The Boeing 777 aircraft took off after a 69-minute delay. JAL issued an apology and pledged to ""implement immediate actions to prevent any future occurrence"", adding that ""safety remains our utmost priority"". The drink-drive limit in England, Wales and Northern Ireland is 80mg per 100ml of blood, compared to 20mg for pilots. Jitsukawa was remanded in custody and will be sentenced at Isleworth Crown Court on 29 November. In June, British Airways pilotJulian Monaghan was jailed for eight monthsfor being caught on duty with 86mg of alcohol in his system.

"Flowers placed at memorials outside of the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh Robert Bowers, the alleged gunman accused of killing 11 Jewish worshippers at a Pittsburgh synagogue on Saturday has pleaded not guilty. Mr Bowers, 46, has requested a jury trial. He faces 44 counts of murder, hate crimes, obstructing religious practices and other crimes. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty. Authorities called the attack on the Tree of Life synagogue the worst anti-Semitic incident in US history. US synagogue shooting: Who is Robert Bowers? Synagogue shooting victims' funerals start Pittsburgh shooting 'will not break us' This video can not be played Rabbi Doris Dyen: 'I'm broken and I can't pray' In addition to those killed, six people were injured, including four police officers, before Mr Bowers surrendered to law enforcement. US media reported Mr Bowers entered the courtroom without a wheelchair, bandaged on the arm from the injuries suffered during a shootout with police on Saturday. With a loud ""yes!"" Mr Bowers confirmed he had read the indictment and understood the charges against him. He reportedly had no reaction when told he faced the death penalty. The federal indictment alleges Mr Bowers walked into the synagogue with multiple firearms, ranted about wanting to ""kill Jews"" and then began gunning down worshippers, as well as firing on police when they arrived. During his first court appearance, Mr Bowers was in a wheelchair and spoke little. On Wednesday, US prosecutors added a further 15 charges to the 29 Mr Bowers already faces, making a total of 44. The additional counts against Mr Bowers were for assaulting police officers and also included special findings to support the case for pursuing the death penalty, US media reported. According to an affidavit, Mr Bowers told police immediately after his arrest that ""he wanted all Jews to die"". Social media accounts purported to be Mr Bowers' also featured anti-Semitic slurs and anti-immigrant sentiments, including a post saying ""I can't sit by and watchâ¦Screw your optics, I'm going in,"" that was uploaded just before the shooting. The charges Mr Bowers faces are: 11 counts of obstructing free exercise of religious beliefs, resulting in death 11 counts of using a firearm to commit murder 11 counts of use of a firearm during a crime of violence 8 counts of obstructing free exercise of religious beliefs involving an attempt to kill a public safety officer 2 counts of obstructing free exercise of religious beliefs involving an attempt to kill 1 count of obstructing free exercise of religious beliefs with a dangerous weapon resulting in injury to an officer Community members hold candles at a vigil for the victims of the Pittsburgh Synagogue shooting at Cambridge City Hall in Cambridge, Massachusetts Funerals for the 11 victims began on Tuesday. Vigils and memorial services continue to take place across the country. The victims ranged in age from 54 to 97 years old.

"Amy Dixon said the pills were inside a jiffy bag Police are investigating a claim youngsters were given ecstasy tablets while trick or treating. Amy Dixon said her children, aged two and five, came home with an envelope containing about 10 suspicious pills after collecting sweets in Shiremoor, North Tyneside, on Wednesday. In a Facebook video, Ms Dixon said she was ""mortified"" by the incident. Northumbria Police said they were conducting inquiries ""to establish if the tablets are harmful"". In the social media post, Ms Dixon said: ""I've just had my kids trick or treating and they've just come home and opened all of their little mix-ups to find a little package. ""Please, please, please all parents make sure that you check your kids' mix-ups, because my children, who are only two and five, have come home to find a packet full of what looks like to be ecstasy tablets. ""I'm absolutely mortified to think that someone has given my children these, so I urge you, please check all of their mix-ups."" She continued to say she was about to take the 10 little pink tablets with an S on them into the police station and that she was shaking at the find. ""This is disgusting, this could have killed my little girls."" Northumbria Police said: ""We are investigating a report from a parent that unknown pink tablets were placed in her daughter's trick or treat bucket in Shiremoor last night.

"Leo Durrington remains in a critical condition in hospital A teenager who drove into a boy in a hit-and-run crash told police he planned to hand himself in ""after watching Love Island"", a court heard. Leo Durrington, three, was flung 17 metres (55 ft) through the air when he was hit by a stolen Ford Transit, in Leigh, Greater Manchester, on Tuesday. At Wigan Youth Court, the teenager admitted causing serious injury by dangerous driving. Another boy, 15, admitted a charge of being carried in a stolen vehicle. The court heard a van was stolen on Monday and the 16-year-old was spotted driving it at about 10:00 GMT the next day in Leigh. It was followed by a police car and ""reacted"" by accelerating up to 50 or 60 mph and overtaking other vehicles, said James Gore, prosecuting. As the van made a right turn it left the road and mounted the pavement. Mr Gore said: ""On the footpath at that time is a mother and a three-year-old."" ""The mother is clipped by the wing mirror of the vehicle but the three-year-old is hit and ejected 17 metres [55 ft] into a nearby car park."" The van failed to stop and was later found abandoned, the court heard. The 15-year-old boy handed himself in to police that evening after contacting his solicitor. About two hours later a police officer went to the 16-year-old's home to arrest him. The defendant told the officer: ""It's all right, I was going to hand myself in after watching Love Island,"" the court heard. He later told police he did not see the youngster or his mother when he drove away. Greater Manchester Police said Leo was still in a critical condition in hospital. Police have released pictures of the van involved The older boy admitted failing to stop for police after a collision, driving without a licence and insurance and a handling a stolen vehicle. Neither of the teenagers can be named because of their ages. The 16-year-old had already been due in court on 15 November, accused of other motoring offences, before the crash involving the child, the court heard. Both boys will be sentenced on that date. Lawyers said the case cannot be transferred to the crown court so the maximum sentence the 16-year-old can face is two years' detention.

"The death of Hwang Yumi prompted her father to lead a compensation campaign The death of a 23-year-old former Samsung worker has led to the company agreeing a major compensation deal. Hwang Yumi died en route to hospital in 2007 after developing leukaemia. Her father led a campaign to shame the company into making payouts for other cases of the disease, miscarriages and other ailments linked to chemicals used at its South Korean factories. Those affected - and workers' children with related ailments - will receive up to 150m won (Â£102,907) per illness. Hwang Sang-ki - a taxi driver - set up the Supporters for the Health and Rights of People in the Semiconductor Industry (Sharps) with the help of local labour activists in November 2007. Families of Samsung workers who died after working at its plants had held protests to pressure it into a deal It organised sit-in protests at various Samsung sites to pressure the company into the deal. It alleged there was a link between the working conditions Samsung maintained and diseases, which also included brain tumours and multiple sclerosis. ""It is truly deplorable that the issues of workers having fallen ill and died from on-the-job chemical exposure remained unsolved for more than 10 long years,""said Hawang Sang-ki in July,external, when the technology company first said it would abide by terms that were subsequently drawn up by a third-party mediator. As of June 2018, Sharps said, it had identified 319 other victims, 117 of whom had died. Campaign group Sharps began documenting cases of suspected work-related illnesses in 2007 The settlement takes into account that it is not always clear how each person came to become ill,according to a report from the Yonhap news agency,external. ""We would like to thank the mediation committee for the efforts that went into this mediation proposal,"" the tech firm told the BBC. ""Samsung Electronics stands by the promise to unconditionally accept the suggested solutions and will work quickly on detailed plans for execution."" The deal extends to both workers directly employed by Samsung as well as those who were hired via sub-contractors. Sums will be determined by the illnesses involved and length of time the person worked at the company's plants.

"The Bank of England has indicated there could be a faster pace of interest rate increases if the UK manages a smooth exit from the European Union. Although the Bank kept rates unchanged at 0.75% this month, its latest forecasts suggest that rates could rise to 1.5% over the next three years. It said that Brexit uncertainty was preventing some firms from investing. However, Bank governor Mark Carney said a smooth Brexit could see a rebound in that investment. ""We do expect a rebound in demand. Business is taking a cautious approach right now as we are at a point of maximum uncertainty, so we have some sense of what is being held back, so we will see a rebound in investment,"" Mr Carney said. Some economists think the Bank might have to be even more aggressive on interest rates. Ruth Gregory, UK economist at Capital Economics, believes that if the UK strikes a deal soon, rates could rise three times in 2019. This video can not be played Bank of England Governor Mark Carney. Hammond hails better borrowing figures Wage growth fastest for nearly 10 years Hot summer gives boost to UK economy Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Macroeconomics says two rate increases next year ""remain a good bet"". While the Bank sees a Brexit deal as the most likely scenario,in its Quarterly Inflation Report,externalit also warned of damage to business if there was no deal. ""An abrupt and disorderly withdrawal could result in delays at borders, disruptions to supply chains, and more rapid and costly shifts in patterns of production, severely impairing the productive capacity of UK business,"" the Bank said. It also thinks the pound would fall and there would be a ""large"" and ""immediate"" fall in economic activity. The Bank's comments came as itsMonetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 9-0,externalto leave rates unchanged at 0.75%. Interest rates were last raised in August as the Bank reacted to stronger data on the economy. The latest decision to keep rates on hold will come as relief to the 3.5 million holders of mortgages that track interest rates, but savers will be disappointed. Szu Ping Chan, BBC economics reporter With just a few months to go until the UK leaves the European Union, there was a clear message from the Bank of England today. The Brexit deal will determine the next move in interest rates. The Bank expects it to be a smooth one. In this scenario households are expected to keep on spending, with businesses unleashing the money they're currently holding back. But Mr Carney made it clear that if the UK crashed out of the EU without a deal, policymakers wouldn't automatically cut rates as they did in the wake of the Brexit vote. Back then, the outlook was uncertain and the UK's exit date was still far away. The no-deal scenario would have a more immediate and permanent impact on prices and the economy, Mr Carney said. So an interest rate cut might not be the appropriate response, although it would still be an option. The Bank's quarterly survey of business leaders indicated that Brexit had become a more important source of uncertainty for them in recent months. As a result, the Bank has slashed its forecast for growth in business investment this year to 0%. However, a smooth Brexit would release that brake on investment, and would come at a time when there is little slack in the economy. In addition, wages are rising, which is supporting consumer spending. All that could force the Bank to raise interest rates to curb inflation. The Bank is forecasting growth of 1.3% this year and 1.7% next year.

"This video can not be played 'Brilliant' Biles wins historic fourth world title Simone Biles made history by becoming the first woman to win four all-around titles at the World Championships. Biles had not competed internationally since the 2016 Olympics, while she revealed in January she hadbeen sexually abusedby a former Team USA sports doctor. In addition, the 21-year-old American wasadmitted to hospitalwith a kidney stone on the eve of the Worlds. ""This is definitely the scariest one from the ones from the past,"" she said. Biles had previously shared the record of three all-around world golds with Svetlana Khorkina of Russia. ""This year has definitely had its ups and downs, going to therapy and other things besides. Just being in the gym has been a little bit rough, but you try to focus on one thing at a time to get through it,"" she said. ""I hope this gives confidence [to other women] that you can still do well and not be penalised for it and for parents to put gymnasts in the sport and feel comfortable."" Britain's Ellie Downie, 19, finished 11th on her return to competition after two operations on her left ankle. On Saturday, Downie takes part in the uneven bars final, while double Olympic champion Max Whitlock will aim to win a third successive world title on the pommel horse. Biles had errors on vault, beam and floor but her total of 57.491 was enough to beat Japan's Mai Murakami into silver and USA's Morgan Hurd into third. A backward roll on landing on vault and a fall off the beam left her almost three full marks down on her qualifying scores. Uneven bars was the Olympic champion's cleanest routine, despite it traditionally being her weakest discipline. Going last on the floor she needed a score of 13.307 to overcome Murakami to take gold and, even with a step out of bounds, Biles scored 15.00 to seal the title by 1.693 marks. ""I wish I could have put out a better performance because that's not the gymnast that I am,"" added Biles, whowon four gold medalsat the 2016 Olympics. ""But we all make mistakes and fall - it's just how you get up and prove yourself."" Biles helped the United States to an emphatic women's team gold earlier in the week and her latest victory saw her win a 12th world title. She has earned 15 World Championships medals, which is five behind the record holder, Khorkina.

"The National Crime Agency is investigating Arron Banks and his Leave.EU campaign for alleged offences committed at the 2016 EU referendum. Mr Banks and another senior campaign figure, Liz Bilney, were referred to the agency by the Electoral Commission. The watchdog said it suspected Mr Banks was not the ""true source"" of loans to the campaign and the money had come ""from impermissible sources"". Mr Banks denied any wrongdoing and said he welcomed the police investigation. He said he was ""confident that a full and frank investigation will finally put an end to the ludicrous allegations levelled against me and my colleagues"". ""There is no evidence of any wrongdoing from the companies I own. I am a UK taxpayer and I have never received any foreign donations.

Some Remain supporters have suggested Brexit should be put on hold pending the outcome of the inquiry. SNP MP Kirsty Blackman told the BBC's Politics Live programme: ""If people are found to be breaking electoral law, then I think there is an issue that you look at the possible validity of the results."" But Labour MP Stephen Kinnock said public trust in the source of political donations was ""bigger than Brexit"". ""I don't think there is a natural connection to this and calling for a re-run of the referendum. I would rather we focus our resources on holding Mr Banks to account,"" he told BBC News. Under UK law, loans and donations to registered campaigners can only come from permissible sources, which essentially excludes overseas or foreign funding. The law was introduced by the Labour government in 2000 after a series of scandals involving overseas donors accused of trying to influence British laws and elections. Leave.EU's chief executive Liz Bilney said all of the money had come from Mr Banks and he was the ""ultimate beneficial owner"" of the companies that had loaned it. As a UK domiciled taxpayer Mr Banks was ""completely permissible to donate money to campaigns as he sees fit"", she told BBC Radio 4's The World at One programme. She denied claims the money had come from Russian sources, saying: ""I run the group of companies where the money was from and we don't have any transactions that are from Russia."" And she said the Electoral Commission had ""failed to understand the nature of the loan agreements"" and were seeing them through ""their own biased lens"". ""I am confident that all the matters will be completely resolved and I will be exonerated and so will Arron and everybody else involved,"" she added.

It also examined a further Â£6m reported to have been given to the organisation, on behalf of Leave.EU, by Mr Banks alone. The commission's legal chief, Bob Posner, said: ""We have reasonable grounds to suspect money given to Better for the Country came from impermissible sources and that Mr Banks and Ms Bilney, the responsible person for Leave.EU, knowingly concealed the true circumstances under which this money was provided. ""This is significant because at least Â£2.9m of this money was used to fund referendum spending and donations during the regulated period of the EU referendum. ""Our investigation has unveiled evidence that suggests criminal offences have been committed which fall beyond the remit of the commission. ""This is why we have handed our evidence to the NCA to allow them to investigate and take any appropriate law enforcement action. This is now a criminal investigation."" He said the financial transactions investigated by the commission included companies incorporated in Gibraltar and the Isle of Man, which were ""beyond the reach"" of the watchdog. The Bristol-based insurance tycoon, who was born in Cheshire, was a Lloyd's underwriter before starting his own firms The twice married father-of-five has been a close friend and supporter of Nigel Farage Mr Banks was a Conservative supporter until 2014 when he defected to UKIP, giving them Â£1m He is said to be one of the biggest political donors in UK history, thought to have given up to Â£9.6m to Leave.EU - which he co-founded - and UKIP Leave.EU, which was backed by then UKIP leader Mr Farage, lost out to Vote Leave in the battle to become the official Leave campaign in the 2016 EU referendum His Leave.EU campaign targeted its message at voters angry about EU immigration The National Crime Agency, which is able to investigate across international borders, said electoral law offences would ""not routinely fall"" within its remit. But it added: ""The nature of the necessary inquiries and the potential for offences to have been committed other than under electoral law lead us to consider an NCA investigation appropriate in this instance. ""This is now a live investigation, and we are unable to discuss any operational detail."" Leave.EU was a separate campaign to the official Vote Leave organisation. The UK's referendum in June 2016 was about whether the UK should Remain or Leave the European Union. The result was that the UK voted by 51.9% to 48.1% to leave the EU. This departure is due to happen on 29 March 2019.

"Jho Low (right) is seen with Wolf of Wall Street star Leonardo DiCaprio in 2013 Two former Goldman Sachs bankers and Malaysian financier Jho Low have been hit with US criminal charges in connection with one of the world's biggest financial scandals. The Department of Justice alleges,externalthe men participated in a scheme that stole billions of dollars from Malaysia's development fund, 1MDB. One former Goldman banker pleaded guilty, the department said. The other banker has been arrested, while Mr Low remains at large. Mr Low, who prosecutors say had ties to government officials and acted as an informal adviser to the 1MDB fund, maintains his innocence, according to a statement issued by his legal team. He has previously denied charges filed in Malaysia, adding that it would be ""impossible"" for him to receive a fair trial there. ""Mr. Low simply asks that the public keep an open mind regarding this case until all of the evidence comes to light, which he believes will vindicate him,"" the statement said. Goldman, which worked to raise money for the 1MDB fund, said on Thursday that it ""continues to co-operate with all authorities investigating this matter"". These are the first US criminal charges to surface in the 1MDB scandal. Authorities say billions of dollars were embezzled from the state fund to buy art, property, a private jet - and even to help finance the Wolf of Wall Street film starring Leonardo DiCaprio. The scandal has prompted investigations around the world and played a role in the election defeat earlier this year of Malaysia's former prime minister, Najib Razak, who is accused of pocketing $700m (Â£517m) from the fund he set up. He has since been charged with corruption, abuse of power and criminal breach of trust in Malaysia. His wife, Rosmah Mansor, has been charged with money laundering. Both deny any wrongdoing. The US v The Wolf of Wall Street 1MDB: Malaysia's global corruption scandal Malaysia seizes handbags stuffed with cash US authorities have previously filed civil suitsaimed at recovering luxury goods, cash and other items allegedly purchased with money from the fund. In this case, prosecutors say former Goldman bankers Tim Leissner and Roger Ng worked with Mr Low to bribe government officials to win 1MDB business for Goldman Sachs. Goldman had previously rejected Mr Low as a client, after compliance officials raised concerns about the source of his money. But in this case, the bankers, along with others at Goldman, worked to conceal Mr Low's involvement, prosecutors say. Ultimately, the bankers worked on three bond offerings in 2012 and 2013 that raised about $6.5bn for the fund and earned Goldman $600m, the indictment says. The money was supposed to support development projects, but prosecutors say the three men ""conspired to launder"" more than $2.7bn through the US financial system. They allegedly used this money to pay bribes and ""for the personal benefit of themselves and their relatives"". Raids on properties linked to Mr Najib uncovered luxury goods worth millions of dollars Mr Low, who was charged earlier in Malaysia, has repeatedly declared his innocence.,externalHe has called the Malaysian charges political. Mr Leissner, who served as Goldman's South East Asia chairman and a participating managing director, has pleaded guilty to conspiring to launder money and violate US anti-bribery laws. Mr Leissner, who left Goldman in February 2016, has been ordered to forfeit $43.7m. Mr Ng was a managing director at Goldman until his departure in May 2014. He was arrested in Malaysia on Thursday. The BBC has not yet been able to contact a lawyer representing him.

Many of the at-risk centres are owned by US private equity firms under deals that will need refinancing. ""If centres close, particularly in small towns, it will be catastrophic,"" Mr Blackley said. ""We have too many of them, doing exactly the same - the same range of stores and products - and basically that's not attractive,"" he added. In pictures: The rise and fall of shopping centres Mother and daughter Helena Waszczyszyn and Anja Ramsden, from Nottingham, said the city's Broadmarsh Centre was ""empty and soulless"". While it is not one of the 200 owned by private equity, the centre has seen shops close over the course of the past decade and is currently awaiting an Â£86m redevelopment. Ms Ramsden said: ""The shops have gone one by one - even when they were there they were a bit rubbish. ""It's desolate in there. There's a toilet, somewhere to sit and it's out of the rain, that's it."" Mother and daughter Helena and Anja described their city's shopping centre as ""desolate"" Jasmin Stephenson, from Eastwood in Nottinghamshire, had a similar view of the centre, saying: ""I literally only go if I have to."" ""A few years ago a lot of businesses closed down and cleared out,"" she said. ""They said they were going to renovate it but nothing has happened. It's not a place I go to now. ""It's a shame, as a lot of history was demolished to make way for it and it's just a concrete block. That's quite depressing."" Mr Blackley, from the National Retail Research Knowledge Exchange Centre, said the growth of online retail in the UK - on sites such as Amazon - had been faster than in almost any other retail market in the world. ""If the major anchor store moves out, that has a halo effect on other stores in that centre. It's a downward spiral and you can't fill shopping centres with nail bars and vape shops."" Chancellor plans High Street rates relief High Street woes hit 22,000 jobs in 2018 Town centres could become ghost towns Steve Hall, from Essex, said: ""I like shopping centres but they do seem to be dying and I wish some money was spent on making them good again."" Steve Hall, from Essex, says shopping centres ""seem to be dying"" Mr Blackley, who is based at Nottingham Trent University's Nottingham Business School, pointed toresearch in the Financial Times,externalthat suggested about Â£2.5bn worth of shopping centres and retail parks are up for sale in towns and cities across the UK. Some of this marketing is unofficial and not in the public domain,"" he said. ""It's a trend that's moving very quickly. You don't necessarily want to be in the business of owning shopping centres at the moment. ""People are suggesting a number of leading national retailers are on the edge and may close and that would bring shopping centres down with them. ""The collapse of BHS, two years ago, left empty units in around 200 shopping centres and more than half of those large, empty units have not yet been filled."" The crisis is affecting shopping centres across the UK, regardless of their location Daniel Mead from asset management firm APAM said. All kinds of shopping centres, regardless of location or whether they are in small towns or major cities, could be affected,"" he said. ""What they have in common is the way in which they are funded - the capital structure behind them. Obviously, if the centre is in a more affluent location, the problem could be easier to fix."" The Nicholsons Centre, in Maidenhead, went into receivership in October One centre which recently went into receivership is the Nicholsons Shopping Centre in Maidenhead which,according to the Financial Times, was bought by Vixcroft, a private equity-backed property specialist and hedge fund Cheyne Capital in 2015,external. The paper described Nicholsons as ""one of the first significant collapses among dozens of UK retail property assets bought by opportunistic investors"". Some centres seem to be caught in a ""downward spiral"" Residents have spoken to the BBC about their concerns regarding a number of shopping centres up and down the country, where they feel empty units and an apparent lack of investment have led to stagnation. Kettering's Newlands Centre, which is backed by private equity, has seen the closure of a number of outlets. ""It's a sad scene at the moment,"" said Paul Ansell, chair of the town's civic society. ""There is a cycle of shops opening and closing and I'm not sure what they can do to improve it."" The Guildhall in Stafford, also backed by a private equity group, has seen many retailers vacate the centre in favour of the town's new Riverside complex. ""We are concerned it's not as vibrant and active as it was,"" said William Read, of the Stafford Historical and Civic Society. ""I walked through there the other day and about 15-20% of the units are empty."" Both private equity groups have been contacted for a comment. The Callendar Square shopping centre in Falkirk, Stirlingshire, was bought by ""global real estate investment manager"" Colony Northstar in 2015. In 2006, the centre was valued at more than Â£25m butlocal media reported it sold for little more than Â£1m at auction last year,external. The Broadmarsh in Nottingham is owned by Intu -currently the subject of a takeover bid,external- which operates shopping centres across the UK. While it does not face the same issues as private-equity backed centres, Mr Blackley said it offers ""about as bad a retail experience as you can get without the centre physically closing"". Nigel Wheatley, the centre's general manager, said preparations were under way for its ""exciting transformation"". Intu, which runs the centre, said it was currently undertaking ""preparatory work"" for a planned Â£86m redevelopment. The research to identify ""at-risk"" centres,externalwas carried out by APAM, which said it had found many of the affected centres had been the subject of short-term speculative deals. Executive director Simon Cooke said: ""We think these shopping centres have been hit with the perfect storm of defaulting retail markets, weaker consumer spending, the impact of the internet and rising rents and rates, making it very difficult for retailers to trade and make a profit. ""We perceive many of these borrowers beginning to breach land covenants."" Mr Cooke said most of the centres ""in crisis"" were the subject of deals that are due to be refinanced. ""They have to return money to their investors,"" said Mr Cooke. ""That's not looking very likely. Frankly, the centres are either going to have to be sold at a lower price or have capital injected in order to regenerate and we don't see banks having an appetite for that."" ""These are big tracts of land, occupying a central space in towns,"" he said. ""You could see increasing vandalism, increasing crime, with a knock-on impact on infrastructure. I'm not suggesting every town is going to face these problems but we need to stop the rot."" ""Politicians need to come up with a plan to kick-start the regeneration of shopping centres,"" he added. A government spokesman said: ""It's true that high streets are changing, like they always have, and we're committed to helping communities adapt."" They said the government had put together an ""expert panel"" to ""diagnose the issues affecting the high street and develop recommendations that will help them thrive"". This site in Richmond, London, will be occupied by both a store and a school The trend of closing shopping centres is fairly well-known in the US, where ""dead mall"" or ""ghost mall"" is the term that describes the decaying edifices left when mainstream department stores have moved out. ""Many of the challenges facing shopping centres in the UK are mirrored in the USA,"" said Mr Blackley. Centres that have prospered, he said, have been canny about expanding their offer. ""UK shopping centres must change if they are to survive,"" according to Mr Blackley. ""They need to think like a hospitality brand. There has been a marked shift to the 'experience economy', and an increase in spend on food and beverage, which is now accounting for over 20% of total spend in some of the newest schemes. ""Some of the big centres in the UK are incorporating Sea Life Centres, ice rinks, indoor ski slopes. These are the shopping centres that, in my view, will survive. ""There's no doubt that if shopping centres don't deliver an experience consumers want, they will fall by the wayside."" Shopping centres should incorporate visitor attractions such as Sea Life, according to the experts Some of the other visions for the future are similarly radical. Mr Mead, head of shopping centre asset management at APAM, said community facilities such as libraries, medical centres and even schools could all sit within retail complexes. ""In Richmond,a new school is being built above a Lidl store, so it's not beyond the realm of possibility,external,"" he said. ""What people like about shopping centres is that they are centrally located with good transport links. The NHS has expressed interest in having a presence in some centres. With a chemist and other retailers already located there, it would be like a one-stop shop in the town centre. ""The problem is, these centres are run by investors who have a short-term approach and haven't the skill-sets or investments to embrace the kind of changes required. There needs to be a joint venture created with local communities to fix the problem."" Coventry's plans for its centre are seen as a positive move for the city In recent months, some local authorities have bought unloved shopping centres from investors keen to offload them. ""In February 2018, Canterbury City Council struck one of the largest shopping centre deals involving a council on record, taking full control of Whitefriars Shopping Centre in the city,"" said Mr Blackley. ""The local authority bought out global fund manager TH Real Estate's 50% stake for Â£75m."" In Shrewsbury, Shropshire Council bought three centres - including one that was neglected - to ""support economic growth and regeneration"" in the town centre. Whether such schemes will work depends on the passion and vision of the authorities concerned and whether they are able to secure private investment. In Coventry, the city council's plan to work with private investors to redevelop its post-war shopping precincts is seen as a good example of how to revive a shopping centre. ""But such investments by councils do risk public money,"" said Mr Blackley. ""In too many cases, councils are trying to plug a gap and I don't think that is sustainable long term.""

"This video can not be played Chief Constable Sara Thornton: ""The reality is we can't just do everything"" Police should focus on burglary and violent crime and not incidents such as misogyny where no offence has been committed, a senior officer has said. Chief Constable Sara Thornton said forces were too stretched to deal with ""deserving"" issues, such as logging hate incidents against women. Claims against dead people were also taking resources from tackling ""today's crime today"", she told a conference. She called for a ""refocus on core policing"". Speaking to police chiefs and police and crime commissioners, Ms Thornton expressed concern abouta review into whether misogyny should be treated as a hate crime. Misogyny is the hatred, dislike or prejudice against women. Ms Thornton, chair of the National Police Chiefs' Council, said that while ""treating misogyny as a hate crime is a concern for some well-organised campaigning organisations"", forces ""do not have the resources to do everything"". She added: ""I want us to solve more burglaries and bear down on violence before we make more records of incidents that are not crimes"", adding she hoped the review ""takes account of the pressure on forces before suggesting the law is changed"". Reality Check: Have police priorities changed? Misogyny could become hate crime after review Police risk becoming 'irrelevant', MPs warn Ms Thornton, the former head of Thames Valley Police, highlightedHome Office statistics,externalpublished last week that showed arrests in England and Wales have halved in the last decade. She told the conference: ""We are asked to provide more and more bespoke services that are all desirable - but the simple fact is there are too many desirable and deserving issues."" She added: ""Neither investigating gender-based hate crime or investigating allegations against those who have died are necessarily bad things - I just argue that they cannot be priorities for a service that is over-stretched."" But Sue Fish, the former chief constable of Nottinghamshire Police, which has been reporting incidents of misogyny as a hate crime for the past two years, told BBC Radio 4's The World at One that Ms Thornton's comments were ""shameful"". She said: ""We're reinforcing that women are not worthy or any sort of service from the police,"" she said, adding that historically, police treatment of female victims of rape and domestic violence had been ""appalling"". Since 2010 police chiefs say funding in England and Wales has decreased, in real terms, by nearly a fifth, and there are 20,000 fewer officers. Richard Garside, director of the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies, said Ms Thornton's intervention comes as the governmentseeks to improve the investigation and reporting of hate crimes,external. ""She's trying to send a message back to government, saying, 'look you're trying to get us to do more and more, well how on earth are we supposed to do all of this and also focus on the core activities,'"" he said. Security minister Ben Wallace said police should prioritise resources based on the level of harm caused by a crime, and forces were free to make these decisions as they saw fit. He added that hate crimes were still important and in some cases could spark other problems such as exploitation and community friction. Speaking at the conference, Home Secretary Sajid Javid acknowledged police were ""feeling stretched"" but promised forces would have the resources they needed by 2019-2020. But shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said forces could not do ""more with less"". Police should not have to ""pick and choose"" between crimes, and if misogyny was made a hate crime the government must provide the funding to tackle it, she added.

"Sports minister Tracey Crouch has resigned over ""delays"" to a crackdown on maximum stakes for fixed-odds betting machines. Chancellor Philip Hammond said in Monday's Budget that the cut in stakes from Â£100 to Â£2 would come into force in October 2019. Ms Crouch said pushing back the date was ""unjustifiable"" and it could cost the lives of problem gamblers. She tweeted: ""Politicians come and go but principles stay with us forever."" Prime Minister Theresa May said she was disappointed Ms Crouch had resigned but there had been ""no delay in bringing forward this important measure"". High stakes for fixed-odds betting machines 'I lost Â£250,000 on betting machines' Betting machine stakes to be cut to Â£2 The government has denied Labour claims that MPs had been led to believe the cut would come into force at the start of the next tax year, in April 2019. They suggested the cut had been intended to be introduced in April 2020. But in her resignation letter, Ms Crouch said:  ""Unfortunately, implementation of these changes are now being delayed until October 2019 due to commitments made by others to those with registered interests.

""From the time of the announcement to reduce stakes and its implementation, over Â£1.6bn will be lost on these machines. ""In addition, two people will tragically take their lives every day due to gambling-related problems and, for that reason as much as any other, I believe this delay is unjustifiable."" She added: ""It is a fact of government that ministers must adhere to collective responsibility and cannot disagree with policy, let alone when it is policy made against your wishes relating to your own portfolio."" Among those praising her on social media, the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welbytweeted,externalthat she was ""principled and courageous"" adding: ""May God bless her commitment to doing right."" Former foreign secretaryBoris Johnson tweeted,externalthat she ""deserves huge credit not just for her campaign but for sticking up for her principles"". This video can not be played What are fixed-odds betting terminals? Fixed-odds betting terminals generate Â£1.8bn in revenue a year for the betting industry,according to the Gambling Commission,external, and taxes of Â£400m for the government. Currently, people can bet up to Â£100 every 20 seconds on electronic casino games such as roulette. Anti-gambling campaigners say the machines let players lose money too quickly, leading to addiction and social, mental and financial problems. But bookmakers have warned the cut in stakes could lead to thousands of outlets closing. In her response to Ms Crouch, the PM said the government had listened to those who wanted the changes to come into effect sooner than April 2020 and ""had agreed that the changes should be in place within the year - by October 2019"". In his Budget on Monday, the chancellor said the change to fixed-odds stakes would come into force next October at the same time as changes to duty charged on gambling firms based abroad but operating in the UK. The government says co-ordinating the date of the two changes would mean the government would not be hit by a fall in tax revenue. The 43-year-old MP has represented Chatham and Aylesford, in Kent, since 2010 She was promoted to the front bench as sports minister in 2015 She is known for her opposition to fox hunting and her love of football - she is a qualified FA coach Grammar school educated at Folkestone School for Girls, she went on to get a degree in law and politics from Hull University She had worked for various Tory MPs, including Michael Howard and David Davis before standing for election She had her first child in 2016 and is thought to have been the first Tory minister to take maternity leave But in the Commons on Thursday, Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson accused the government of ""capitulating to the gambling industry"". He praised Ms Crouch's ""courageous and principled decision"" and said Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright ""should be thoroughly ashamed"" of prioritising ""corporate interests over victims, profits over public health and greed over good"". MPs from all sides of the House joined in his criticism. Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith said it should be discussed as part of the Finance Bill later this month. Week ahead in Parliament: The Finance Bill He told the BBC: ""There are plenty of people whose lives have been damaged by this addiction... We need to do this very quickly, as quickly as we can and in the meantime, the gambling industry will make about Â£1bn as a result of this delay. That's not right."" Labour has told the BBC that they will put down an amendment to the Finance Bill to try and bring in the changes next April.

"This video can not be played 'Brilliant' Biles wins historic fourth world title Simone Biles made history by becoming the first woman to win four all-around titles at the World Championships. Biles had not competed internationally since the 2016 Olympics, while she revealed in January she hadbeen sexually abusedby a former Team USA sports doctor. In addition, the 21-year-old American wasadmitted to hospitalwith a kidney stone on the eve of the Worlds. ""This is definitely the scariest one from the ones from the past,"" she said. Biles had previously shared the record of three all-around world golds with Svetlana Khorkina of Russia. ""This year has definitely had its ups and downs, going to therapy and other things besides. Just being in the gym has been a little bit rough, but you try to focus on one thing at a time to get through it,"" she said. ""I hope this gives confidence [to other women] that you can still do well and not be penalised for it and for parents to put gymnasts in the sport and feel comfortable."" Britain's Ellie Downie, 19, finished 11th on her return to competition after two operations on her left ankle. On Saturday, Downie takes part in the uneven bars final, while double Olympic champion Max Whitlock will aim to win a third successive world title on the pommel horse. Biles had errors on vault, beam and floor but her total of 57.491 was enough to beat Japan's Mai Murakami into silver and USA's Morgan Hurd into third. A backward roll on landing on vault and a fall off the beam left her almost three full marks down on her qualifying scores. Uneven bars was the Olympic champion's cleanest routine, despite it traditionally being her weakest discipline. Going last on the floor she needed a score of 13.307 to overcome Murakami to take gold and, even with a step out of bounds, Biles scored 15.00 to seal the title by 1.693 marks. ""I wish I could have put out a better performance because that's not the gymnast that I am,"" added Biles, whowon four gold medalsat the 2016 Olympics. ""But we all make mistakes and fall - it's just how you get up and prove yourself."" Biles helped the United States to an emphatic women's team gold earlier in the week and her latest victory saw her win a 12th world title. She has earned 15 World Championships medals, which is five behind the record holder, Khorkina.

"Shareholders in the owner of struggling cafe chain Patisserie Valerie have vented their anger at the firm's chairman, despite backing his rescue plan for the business. At an emergency general meeting, more than 99% of shareholders backed a plan to issue Â£15m of new shares. However, investors in the 206-store chain harangued chairman Luke Johnson. They felt cheated that new investors are getting a share of the company at a knock-down price. Shareholders also accused Mr Johnson of ""holding a gun"" to their heads over the rescue deal. This video can not be played Patisserie Valerie shareholder Chris Boxall said the plan was the best outcome One shareholder, Heather Goddard, told the BBC: ""I felt closed off in the meeting and I didn't feel any questions were answered. ""I felt when he came in and started the meeting saying 99% of the votes in by proxy were in support of them, what he was basically saying to me was, 'You don't count.' ""When I asked him why there was there a gun to our head for this deadline... he didn't provide me with an answer I understood."" Simon Jack, business editor Ultimately, the shareholders had no choice. Approve a plan that will see new investors get shares at a massive discount to the existing owners - or see the company collapse, wiping out the value of their investment entirely. Serial entrepreneur Luke Johnson, who built Pizza Express and Feng Sushi into successful businesses and owned 37% of Patisserie Valerie, put Â£20m of his own money into the company in early October, when the chain was hours away from folding. That didn't stop small shareholders from being angry and feeling short-changed. There were bad-tempered exchanges at the company's emergency meeting. The sale of Â£15m in new shares will be used to pay Mr Johnson back Â£10m of his emergency loan. Many small investors told the BBC they backed the company because they trusted Mr Johnson. He said he would be stepping down from a significant number of other company boards to focus on reviving that trust and the company. With a forensic accounting probe and a Serious Fraud Office inquiry under way, that will be a full-time job. Mr Johnson was forced to lend Patisserie Holdings - which owns the Patisserie Valerie chain - Â£20m of his own money to prevent its collapse after directors said it required an immediate cash injection. He said on Thursday that the firm had been ""three hours from going into bankruptcy"", adding that he would be reducing his other commitments to focus on rescuing Patisserie Valerie. The chain is still fighting for survival after revealing last month it had uncovered ""significant, and potentially fraudulent, accounting irregularities"". Trading in the company's shares has been temporarily  halted. Finance director Chris Marsh is the subject of a criminal investigation.

"Questions have been raised about a recent report on warming in the ocean Errors have been found in a recent study suggesting the oceans were soaking up more heat than previously estimated. The initial report suggested that theseas have absorbed 60% more than previously thought,external. But a re-examination by a mathematician showed that the margin of error was larger than in the published study. The authors have acknowledged the problem and have submitted a correction to the journal. What is climate change? Final call to halt 'climate catastrophe' Risk of 'Hothouse Earth' despite CO2 cuts This video can not be played No more beef? Five things you can do to help stop rising global temperatures According to thelast major assessment,externalby the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the world's oceans have taken up more than 90% of the excess heat trapped by greenhouse gases. But the new study claimed that every year, for the past 25 years, we have put about 150 times the amount of energy used to generate electricity globally into the seas - 60% more than previous estimates. The authors suggested that this had huge implications for the way that the world is warming. If far more heat than previously believed was going into oceans, it also meant that far more heat than we thought has been generated by the warming gases we have emitted in the world to date. Therefore more heat from the same amount of gas means the Earth is more sensitive to CO2. Since 2007, scientists have been able to rely on a system of almost4,000 Argo floats,externalthat record temperature and salinity in the oceans around the world. But prior to this, the methods used to measure the heat in the ocean had many flaws and uncertainties. The team involved in the study used a new approach to measuring the amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the air. They believed that this allowed them to accurately measure ocean temperatures globally, dating back to 1991, when data from a global network of stations became available. The key element in this methodology is the fact that, as waters get warmer, they release more carbon dioxide and oxygen into the air. ""When the ocean warms, the amount of these gases that the ocean is able to hold goes down,"" said lead author Dr Laure Resplandy from Princeton University. ""So what we measured was the amount lost by the oceans, and then we can calculate how much warming we need to explain that change in gases."" They were discovered by a mathematician,Nicholas Lewis,external, who has long been critical of climate models, arguing that they are over-sensitive to emissions of carbon dioxide. He reviewed the paper when it was published and found what he termed ""serious (but surely inadvertent) errors in the underlying calculations."" The key element deals with the amount of uncertainty in the measurements. As a result of the increased margin of error, the findings on the amount of heat being absorbed by the oceans can't be definitively supported. They've put their hands up and acknowledged the error. Ralph Keeling, who co-authored the study said in a statement that he takes responsibility for the ""oversights"" and would like to ""thank Nicholas Lewis for bringing an apparent anomaly in the trend calculation to our attention."" ""These problems do not invalidate the methodology or the new insights into ocean biogeochemistry on which it is based, but they do influence the mean rate of warming we infer, and more importantly, the uncertainties of that calculation."" The authors say they have now reworked their calculations and submitted a correction to the journal, Nature, which originally published the study. This video can not be played Climate change: How 1.5C could change the world They have issued an editor's note about the issue. ""We would like to alert readers that the authors have informed us of errors in the paper. An implication of the errors is that the uncertainties in ocean heat content are substantially underestimated. We are working with the authors to establish the quantitative impact of the errors on the published results, at which point in time we will provide a further update."" According to the scientists involved in the original study, the ocean is still probably warming more than the estimate used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. But the errors mean that it has a larger range of probability - between 10% and 70%. This is in line with other studies. ""Our error margins are too big now to really weigh in on the precise amount of warming that's going on in the ocean,"" Ralph Keeling said. ""We really muffed the error margins."" UPDATE:The original version of this story was published before the errors in the study came to light.

"Brace, brace. The latest changes to Ryanair's baggage policies take effect today, meaning passengers who want to take anything more than a small bag on board must pay for the privilege. Only those paying Â£6/â¬6 for priority boarding will be able to take a small suitcase of up to 10kg in the cabin. That option is cheaper than the Â£8/â¬8 charge to check in a 10kg bag. Ryanair says the changes - the second this year - are intended to reduce flight delays. The problem faced by the Irish carrier - along with many other airlines - is the lack of overhead locker space on the Boeing 737 and the Airbus A320 aircraft used for short-haul routes. Gerald Khoo, an analyst at Liberum, says Ryanair planes have room for about 90 ""wheelie"" suitcases, considerably fewer than the 189 passengers it can hold. As the airline's flights are on average 95% full, there clearly isn't enough space for everyone's luggage. ""They are effectively rationing scarce capacity and saying if you want that space in the cabin, then you have to pay for it,"" Mr Khoo says. This video can not be played Watch: Your bag's journey through the airport Since January, Ryanair passengers have been allowed to take one small bag on board and one wheelie bag free of charge. However, that often required up to 120 larger bags to be tagged at the gate and put in the hold, delaying departures (every minute counts, given the airline's 25-minute turnaround target). Larger checked-in luggage will still cost Â£25 per bag. The small bag that non-priority passengers can take on board is now 40% larger than previously allowed at 40x20x25cm. It must fit under the seat in front of you - not ideal if you value your leg room. Easyjet is slightly more generous, as all passengers can take a bigger bag - up to 56x45x25cm - in the cabin, with the caveat that some may have to be checked in the hold free of charge. Depending on when you book your flight, paying the higher price may be the only option. That's because priority boarding is limited to 95 customers per flight - about half the number of seats. Sophie Griffiths, editor of Travel Trade Gazette, fears some passengers may only learn of the new rules when they get to the gate. ""I'm not sure everyone will be aware of the changes - it could result in massive confusion,"" she says. ""It's just one more thing for passengers to get their heads around."" Travellers who do try to board with a wheelie case but have not paid will have to hand over Â£25/â¬25 to have it put in the hold. Ms Griffiths said one winner from the move could be British Airways, whose standard fares include a checked-in bag. This is the second time Ryanair has changed its baggage rules this year. The revision may not be the last, says Mr Khoo. British Airways,external One cabin bag up to 56x45x25cm and 23kg and one handbag/laptop bag (max. 23kg and up to 40x30x15cm) for standard fares. The smaller bag is guaranteed to go in the cabin, but on busy flights, the larger bag may be put in the hold free of charge. easyJet,external One cabin bag up to 56x45x25cm with no weight limit, but you must be able to lift it into the overhead locker. EasyJet says only about 70 cabin bags can fit in the overhead lockers, so all others will be put in the hold. Any bags larger than the specified size will be checked into the hold for afee,external. Ryanair,external Non-priority passengers: One small bag such as a handbag, laptop bag or small backpack up to 40x20x25cm that must fit under the seat in front of you. Priority passengers: One small bag up to 40x20x25cm and one bag of 55x40x20cm and up to 10kg Wizz Air,external All passengers can take a carry-on bag up to 40x30x20cm onboard to be placed under the seat in front. Those who pay for priority boarding can also bring an extra wheelie bag of up to 55x40x23cm in the cabin.

"The Bank of England has indicated there could be a faster pace of interest rate increases if the UK manages a smooth exit from the European Union. Although the Bank kept rates unchanged at 0.75% this month, its latest forecasts suggest that rates could rise to 1.5% over the next three years. It said that Brexit uncertainty was preventing some firms from investing. However, Bank governor Mark Carney said a smooth Brexit could see a rebound in that investment. ""We do expect a rebound in demand. Business is taking a cautious approach right now as we are at a point of maximum uncertainty, so we have some sense of what is being held back, so we will see a rebound in investment,"" Mr Carney said. Some economists think the Bank might have to be even more aggressive on interest rates. Ruth Gregory, UK economist at Capital Economics, believes that if the UK strikes a deal soon, rates could rise three times in 2019. This video can not be played Bank of England Governor Mark Carney. Hammond hails better borrowing figures Wage growth fastest for nearly 10 years Hot summer gives boost to UK economy Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Macroeconomics says two rate increases next year ""remain a good bet"". While the Bank sees a Brexit deal as the most likely scenario,in its Quarterly Inflation Report,externalit also warned of damage to business if there was no deal. ""An abrupt and disorderly withdrawal could result in delays at borders, disruptions to supply chains, and more rapid and costly shifts in patterns of production, severely impairing the productive capacity of UK business,"" the Bank said. It also thinks the pound would fall and there would be a ""large"" and ""immediate"" fall in economic activity. The Bank's comments came as itsMonetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 9-0,externalto leave rates unchanged at 0.75%. Interest rates were last raised in August as the Bank reacted to stronger data on the economy. The latest decision to keep rates on hold will come as relief to the 3.5 million holders of mortgages that track interest rates, but savers will be disappointed. Szu Ping Chan, BBC economics reporter With just a few months to go until the UK leaves the European Union, there was a clear message from the Bank of England today. The Brexit deal will determine the next move in interest rates. The Bank expects it to be a smooth one. In this scenario households are expected to keep on spending, with businesses unleashing the money they're currently holding back. But Mr Carney made it clear that if the UK crashed out of the EU without a deal, policymakers wouldn't automatically cut rates as they did in the wake of the Brexit vote. Back then, the outlook was uncertain and the UK's exit date was still far away. The no-deal scenario would have a more immediate and permanent impact on prices and the economy, Mr Carney said. So an interest rate cut might not be the appropriate response, although it would still be an option. The Bank's quarterly survey of business leaders indicated that Brexit had become a more important source of uncertainty for them in recent months. As a result, the Bank has slashed its forecast for growth in business investment this year to 0%. However, a smooth Brexit would release that brake on investment, and would come at a time when there is little slack in the economy. In addition, wages are rising, which is supporting consumer spending. All that could force the Bank to raise interest rates to curb inflation. The Bank is forecasting growth of 1.3% this year and 1.7% next year.

"The UK government is preparing to launch a smartphone app to make it as easy as possible for EU citizens to apply to remain in the UK after Brexit - the only problem is it doesn't fully work on Apple devices. And hopes that the problem would have been fixed by now have just been dashed. The app is a key part of the government's drive to get the estimated 3.5 million EU citizens in the UK to apply for ""settled status"". App users answer three ""simple"" questions, take a ""selfie"" to be checked against Home Office records and then - if they have an Android phone - scan the chip on their passport to verify their identity. The Home Office says a decision will be made on whether they can stay in the UK within two weeks. As things stand, people with Apple devices will not be able to scan their passports and will either have to borrow an Android phone to complete their application or post their passport to the UK Visa and Immigration Service instead, meaning the process is likely to take longer. For those who are not sure, Android is the system that is used by Samsung, Huawei, Sony, Google and Nokia among others. They make up about 50% of the market in the UK, with Apple's iPhone making up the other half. The Microsoft and Blackberry operating systems for smartphones, which make up nearly 1% of the UK market between them, will also not be able to scan passport chips. Older versions of Android phones and some budget models are not fitted with a chip scanner either. UK's plan for EU citizens who want to stay Home Office officials knew there would be a problem with Apple devices when the app was announced early this year. But they were hoping Apple would release an update to its operating system to allow users of the firm's devices to scan their passports in the same way that people with Android phones can. The US tech giant has so far declined to do so, despite representations from UK government ministers, including a trip to the firm's Silicon Valley HQ by Home Secretary Sajid Javid. It is not a technical problem. Apple devices have been fitted with Near Field Communication chips, as they are known, since 2014. But the company has mostly limited use of the chip to Apple Pay transactions, for security and commercial reasons. There was speculation on tech blogs that Apple would unlock the chip reader to third party apps when it rolled out its latest operating system, 12.1, a process currently under way. But Apple has confirmed to the BBC that those rumours were not true and it has not been unlocked. Sajid Javid has met Apple bosses in California to make the UK's case Sources say the firm is continuing to work with the Home Office but would not be drawn on whether a solution is likely to be found before the UK leaves the EU in March. Home Offices sources told the BBC ""we are continuing to engage with Apple at the highest level"". But immigration minister Caroline Nokes, ina tetchy appearance before the Home Affairs Committeeon Tuesday, gave a hint of the frustrations at the top of government, after it was pointed out to her that only half of the intended audience for the new app would be able to use it. She told MPs the Home Office could not be blamed because Apple ""won't release the upgrade we need in order for it to function"". The Home Office has just finished private testing of the app, among 650 NHS and university workers in the North-West of England, and is now expanding the trials with a view to launching it to the wider public in the New Year. Apple Pay has been around since 2014 The Dutch government is also calling on Apple to unlock its chip reader to allow citizens to access its digital services. The Home Office also stresses that people will be able to use desktop computers to apply for settled status, although like Apple users, applicants will have to post their passports off rather than being able to scan the passport's chips. A Home Office spokesman said: ""EU citizens will be able to apply for that status using any smartphone, tablet or computer. ""The app to check identity is only part of the process for those who choose to use it and there will be an alternative non-digital route available to all applicants to prove their identity."" The Home Office has also signed a Â£91m contract with French company Sopra Steria to set up a service at 56 local libraries, where library staff will help people who have already completed their visa application online to scan and submit their documentation and biometric data. The scheme will cover all visa applications, not just those from EU citizens. It means applicants won't have to post off passports and other documents, the company says, and can complete their visa application locally. But given how much emphasis ministers placed on the convenience and ease with which EU citizens would be able to apply by smartphone - and the sheer volume of people they need to process - the continuing issues with Apple have to be seen as a setback. They are also an illustration of the problems governments can encounter when their digital ambitions run up against the commercial priorities of the companies they need to deliver them.

"This video can not be played Chief Constable Sara Thornton: ""The reality is we can't just do everything"" Police should focus on burglary and violent crime and not incidents such as misogyny where no offence has been committed, a senior officer has said. Chief Constable Sara Thornton said forces were too stretched to deal with ""deserving"" issues, such as logging hate incidents against women. Claims against dead people were also taking resources from tackling ""today's crime today"", she told a conference. She called for a ""refocus on core policing"". Speaking to police chiefs and police and crime commissioners, Ms Thornton expressed concern abouta review into whether misogyny should be treated as a hate crime. Misogyny is the hatred, dislike or prejudice against women. Ms Thornton, chair of the National Police Chiefs' Council, said that while ""treating misogyny as a hate crime is a concern for some well-organised campaigning organisations"", forces ""do not have the resources to do everything"". She added: ""I want us to solve more burglaries and bear down on violence before we make more records of incidents that are not crimes"", adding she hoped the review ""takes account of the pressure on forces before suggesting the law is changed"". Reality Check: Have police priorities changed? Misogyny could become hate crime after review Police risk becoming 'irrelevant', MPs warn Ms Thornton, the former head of Thames Valley Police, highlightedHome Office statistics,externalpublished last week that showed arrests in England and Wales have halved in the last decade. She told the conference: ""We are asked to provide more and more bespoke services that are all desirable - but the simple fact is there are too many desirable and deserving issues."" She added: ""Neither investigating gender-based hate crime or investigating allegations against those who have died are necessarily bad things - I just argue that they cannot be priorities for a service that is over-stretched."" But Sue Fish, the former chief constable of Nottinghamshire Police, which has been reporting incidents of misogyny as a hate crime for the past two years, told BBC Radio 4's The World at One that Ms Thornton's comments were ""shameful"". She said: ""We're reinforcing that women are not worthy or any sort of service from the police,"" she said, adding that historically, police treatment of female victims of rape and domestic violence had been ""appalling"". Since 2010 police chiefs say funding in England and Wales has decreased, in real terms, by nearly a fifth, and there are 20,000 fewer officers. Richard Garside, director of the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies, said Ms Thornton's intervention comes as the governmentseeks to improve the investigation and reporting of hate crimes,external. ""She's trying to send a message back to government, saying, 'look you're trying to get us to do more and more, well how on earth are we supposed to do all of this and also focus on the core activities,'"" he said. Security minister Ben Wallace said police should prioritise resources based on the level of harm caused by a crime, and forces were free to make these decisions as they saw fit. He added that hate crimes were still important and in some cases could spark other problems such as exploitation and community friction. Speaking at the conference, Home Secretary Sajid Javid acknowledged police were ""feeling stretched"" but promised forces would have the resources they needed by 2019-2020. But shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said forces could not do ""more with less"". Police should not have to ""pick and choose"" between crimes, and if misogyny was made a hate crime the government must provide the funding to tackle it, she added.

Some Remain supporters have suggested Brexit should be put on hold pending the outcome of the inquiry. SNP MP Kirsty Blackman told the BBC's Politics Live programme: ""If people are found to be breaking electoral law, then I think there is an issue that you look at the possible validity of the results."" But Labour MP Stephen Kinnock said public trust in the source of political donations was ""bigger than Brexit"". ""I don't think there is a natural connection to this and calling for a re-run of the referendum. I would rather we focus our resources on holding Mr Banks to account,"" he told BBC News. Under UK law, loans and donations to registered campaigners can only come from permissible sources, which essentially excludes overseas or foreign funding. The law was introduced by the Labour government in 2000 after a series of scandals involving overseas donors accused of trying to influence British laws and elections. Leave.EU's chief executive Liz Bilney said all of the money had come from Mr Banks and he was the ""ultimate beneficial owner"" of the companies that had loaned it. As a UK domiciled taxpayer Mr Banks was ""completely permissible to donate money to campaigns as he sees fit"", she told BBC Radio 4's The World at One programme. She denied claims the money had come from Russian sources, saying: ""I run the group of companies where the money was from and we don't have any transactions that are from Russia."" And she said the Electoral Commission had ""failed to understand the nature of the loan agreements"" and were seeing them through ""their own biased lens"". ""I am confident that all the matters will be completely resolved and I will be exonerated and so will Arron and everybody else involved,"" she added. This video can not be played Liz Bilney: ""I'm confident I will be exonerated and so will Arron"" The Electoral Commission investigation focused on Â£2m reported to have been loaned to Better for the Country, which ran Leave.EU, by Mr Banks and his group of insurance companies. It also examined a further Â£6m reported to have been given to the organisation, on behalf of Leave.EU, by Mr Banks alone. The commission's legal chief, Bob Posner, said: ""We have reasonable grounds to suspect money given to Better for the Country came from impermissible sources and that Mr Banks and Ms Bilney, the responsible person for Leave.EU, knowingly concealed the true circumstances under which this money was provided. ""This is significant because at least Â£2.9m of this money was used to fund referendum spending and donations during the regulated period of the EU referendum.

"The reduction in charges follow a period of cuts for the police The number of criminal charges being brought in England and Wales has been falling - despite more crimes being recorded in the same period. BBC analysis of Home Office data for Panorama shows 527,000 charges were brought in 2016-17 - a fall of 65,000 on 2014-15. Meanwhile, the number of crimes recorded rose by nearly 750,000. Police say a squeeze on resources is making crime harder to investigate. The Home Office says it is working with police to find a solution. You need a modern browser to view the interactive content in this page. If the police force lookup does not load clickhere,external. The picture in Northern Ireland and Scotland is different. Charges have fallen at the same rate as recorded crime in Northern Ireland. In Scotland where the criminal justice system is different, they record clear-ups, a broader category than charges  - these have fallen in line with recorded crime. West Yorkshire Police Chief Constable Dee Collins says things are stretched. ""My officers and staff, I think do a fantastic job with the resource that we have, but I realise that we are letting some people down,"" she said. ""Since 2010 we've had a 35% real-term cut and what that has meant in terms of officers and staff numbers is I have 1,400 fewer people."" Fewer charges means victims such as Richard Bolland are not getting justice. Last year he was attacked in the fish and chip shop he runs in Wyke, near Bradford. He was so severely beaten he passed out and says the attack left him looking ""like Frankenstein"". Then he was robbed. ""He took my wallets, the company money, the money to pay the suppliers, the till float, he took everything,"" Mr Bolland said. Richard Bolland was beaten about the head He says the initial response from the police was good, but he feels let down by CID. No-one was ever caught and he was told by the police that if he could come up with a lead to help them, then he should let them know. ""Other than that it was on the shelf. And since then I've not heard a single thing from them."" West Yorkshire Police say that despite receiving tip-offs about who attacked Mr Bolland they could not gather enough evidence to bring them in. They say they have reviewed the case and believe they responded in the right way. ""I think there is an emerging crisis and it's a crisis that's right at the heart of policing, the investigation of crime,"" says Peter Neyroud, a former chief constable. He describes the fall in charges as significant and depressing. Home Office minister Victoria Atkins says the government is looking at this problem ""very carefully"" to see whether there is a problem at force level or if there is something it can do nationally. ""We want to ensure that when a victim reports a crime to the police that it's investigated properly and thoroughly and that any charges that are appropriate are made,"" she said. The number of crimes recorded by police in England and Wales has risen by nearly 750,000 in the last three years. Some of this rise is because police are recording crime better. In early 2014 an investigation by the House of Commons Public Administration Select Committee found that forces had been under-recording crime. As a result data audits are being carried out on each force by the Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary. But some crimes are genuinely up. If you look at the more accurate Crime Survey for England and Wales, offences such as burglary, robbery and some violent crimes are rising. Either way the police have more cases to investigate than they did in 2014. Knife crime rises 22% Reality Check - Is crime up or down? The reduction in charges follow a period of cuts for the police. There are about 20,000 fewer police officers in England and Wales than there were in 2010. ""That's four and a half million policing days of investigation,"" said Mr Neyroud. He says there is also an increased demand for the police service to investigate more rapes, modern slavery, terrorism and organised crime. Forces are having to make tough choices, Dee Collins says ""That's shifting all the experienced resources into those areas and leaving a considerable drop in the expertise in dealing with the basic day-to-day crimes which are the ones that most of the public are concerned about."" He believes this is leading to police screening crimes for those they feel they can investigate successfully and those they can't. In West Yorkshire, Ms Collins admits they are having to make pragmatic decisions about which crimes to follow up. ""For example if it was an elderly victim and something that might feel fairly low-level we will probably still attend. If perhaps it had been myself ringing about a particular issue we might not. "" It has certainly shaken Mr Bolland's faith in the abilities of the police. ""The thin blue line, it's a dotted line now and the dots are getting further and further apart,"" he says. Richard Bolland back in his chip shop Tight resources and rising crime have brought back bad memories for Mr Neyroud from his time in the police. ""We spent more of our time apologising for what we weren't able to do than doing what we were able. ""The police service appears to me to be in that position again."" Data Analysis by Wesley Stephenson, Ransome Mpini, and William Dahlgreen.  Design and development by Sumi Senthinathan, Steven Connor, and Becky Rush. Methodology: 1. England and Wales We have looked at the outcomes data and recorded crime data for the three years between 2014-15 and 2016-17. 2016-17 is the latest full year for which we have data. Method for calculating change in recorded crime and charges: For charges we have used: 'Outcomes open data year ending March' for 2014-15, 2015-16, 2016-17 taking the data for charges recorded in each particular year. For recorded crime we have used: 'Police recorded crime open data Police Force Area tables from year ending March 2013 onwards' We calculated percentage change using the data for the first and last years in our time period. In the crime categories chart we have removed any category with fewer than 50 charges in the base year of 2014-15. This is consistent with methodology used by the Office for National Statistics. Data,external 2. Northern Ireland For the PSNI we only have two years of data 2015-16 and 2016-17. PSNI use the same crime categories and recording methods as England and Wales. To calculate the PSNI percentage change we have used the data for the first and last years in our time period. Data,external 3. Scotland Police Scotland has different crime categories to England and Wales and it also uses the broader category of 'clear ups' rather than charges. The data we use for Scotland is as follows: Scotland (data coverage dates 2015-16 to 2016-17) Data,external 4. Chart 1: Recorded crime is up but charges are down. For the years between 2007-8 and 2016-17 we have used the same data as above plus: 'Police recorded crime open data Police Force Area tables from March 2008 to March 2012'.  To calculate change we have excluded fraud offences and then calculated the year- on-year change in total recorded crime and the year on year change in total charges for England and Wales.

"Questions have been raised about a recent report on warming in the ocean Errors have been found in a recent study suggesting the oceans were soaking up more heat than previously estimated. The initial report suggested that theseas have absorbed 60% more than previously thought,external. But a re-examination by a mathematician showed that the margin of error was larger than in the published study. The authors have acknowledged the problem and have submitted a correction to the journal. What is climate change? Final call to halt 'climate catastrophe' Risk of 'Hothouse Earth' despite CO2 cuts This video can not be played No more beef? Five things you can do to help stop rising global temperatures According to thelast major assessment,externalby the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the world's oceans have taken up more than 90% of the excess heat trapped by greenhouse gases. But the new study claimed that every year, for the past 25 years, we have put about 150 times the amount of energy used to generate electricity globally into the seas - 60% more than previous estimates. The authors suggested that this had huge implications for the way that the world is warming. If far more heat than previously believed was going into oceans, it also meant that far more heat than we thought has been generated by the warming gases we have emitted in the world to date. Therefore more heat from the same amount of gas means the Earth is more sensitive to CO2. Since 2007, scientists have been able to rely on a system of almost4,000 Argo floats,externalthat record temperature and salinity in the oceans around the world. But prior to this, the methods used to measure the heat in the ocean had many flaws and uncertainties. The team involved in the study used a new approach to measuring the amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the air. They believed that this allowed them to accurately measure ocean temperatures globally, dating back to 1991, when data from a global network of stations became available. The key element in this methodology is the fact that, as waters get warmer, they release more carbon dioxide and oxygen into the air. ""When the ocean warms, the amount of these gases that the ocean is able to hold goes down,"" said lead author Dr Laure Resplandy from Princeton University. ""So what we measured was the amount lost by the oceans, and then we can calculate how much warming we need to explain that change in gases."" They were discovered by a mathematician,Nicholas Lewis,external, who has long been critical of climate models, arguing that they are over-sensitive to emissions of carbon dioxide. He reviewed the paper when it was published and found what he termed ""serious (but surely inadvertent) errors in the underlying calculations."" The key element deals with the amount of uncertainty in the measurements. As a result of the increased margin of error, the findings on the amount of heat being absorbed by the oceans can't be definitively supported. They've put their hands up and acknowledged the error. Ralph Keeling, who co-authored the study said in a statement that he takes responsibility for the ""oversights"" and would like to ""thank Nicholas Lewis for bringing an apparent anomaly in the trend calculation to our attention."" ""These problems do not invalidate the methodology or the new insights into ocean biogeochemistry on which it is based, but they do influence the mean rate of warming we infer, and more importantly, the uncertainties of that calculation."" The authors say they have now reworked their calculations and submitted a correction to the journal, Nature, which originally published the study. This video can not be played Climate change: How 1.5C could change the world They have issued an editor's note about the issue. ""We would like to alert readers that the authors have informed us of errors in the paper. An implication of the errors is that the uncertainties in ocean heat content are substantially underestimated. We are working with the authors to establish the quantitative impact of the errors on the published results, at which point in time we will provide a further update."" According to the scientists involved in the original study, the ocean is still probably warming more than the estimate used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. But the errors mean that it has a larger range of probability - between 10% and 70%. This is in line with other studies. ""Our error margins are too big now to really weigh in on the precise amount of warming that's going on in the ocean,"" Ralph Keeling said. ""We really muffed the error margins.""

Security Minister Ben Wallace said he wanted to target groups - such as accountants and estate agents - who launder money for the criminals. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that those at the ""bottom of the pyramid"", who were dealing drugs or laundering money for crime bosses - who he referred to as ""foot soldiers"" of organised crime - needed to face ""the same weight of the law"" as those at the top.

"The UK has struck a deal with the EU on post-Brexit financial services, according to unconfirmed reports. The Times newspaper said London had agreed in talks with Brussels to give UK financial services firms continued access to the bloc. The pound has risen 1% against the dollar in response. But a government source said that was ""a rather rose-tinted interpretation of where we have got to"". The source told the BBC: ""People shouldn't get ahead of themselves."" The Times said in its report that an initial deal on exchange of data had also been agreed. It added the deal was expected to be completed within three weeks. Sterling rose on hopes of an agreement, with the pound up by more than a cent against the dollar at $1.2887. Britain's departure from the European Union is expected to take place in March next year,but many UK-based businesses have expressed concern over the lack of progress in Brexit talks. UK firms 'near point of no return' At-a-glance: The UK's four Brexit options Brexit divorce cost 'uncertain' Despite various reassurances from Prime Minister Theresa May that definite trade terms between firms in the UK and the EU will be finalised by March next year, businesses across the boardare already preparing for the worst. Mrs May's senior adviser on Europe, Oliver Robbins, was continuing the negotiations in Brussels, The Times said. Dominic O'Connell, Today programme business presenter Equivalence - the apparent basis of Theresa May's reported deal with Brussels on financial services - sounds like a cuddly continuation of what the City has now. It is not. In this context, equivalence is a legal term describing the regime the EU uses when dealing with countries outside its boundaries. The EU grants equivalence to other states if it can be persuaded that its rules are the same as the ones set by Brussels. Equivalence, and the trading rights that come with it, can be withdrawn at any time. That is why when one of the big City law firms, Hogan Lovells, was asked to look at equivalence by the City UK, the trade body for the Square Mile, its conclusion was that it did not ""provide a long-term sustainable solution"". What we do not know, however, is whether Mrs May has managed to negotiate some kind of ""equivalence-plus"",  with the kind of safeguards that would ease City fears. In any event, reports of any kind of deal were enough to rally sterling, and even those unhappy with the idea of equivalence would concede that it is probably better than no deal at all. According to the newspaper's report, the deal means that after Brexit, UK financial services companies will be able to operate within the EU as they do now. The Times said the EU would accept that the UK had ""equivalent"" regulations to Brussels and would therefore be allowed market access. However, there has been no official confirmation of the report. Thomas Moore, investment director of UK equities at Aberdeen Standard Investments, told the BBC's Today programme that if true, ""I think on balance, it's positive."" He said the granting of equivalence, much desired by the City, ""produces much greater certainty, not just for financial companies"". What's the latest on the Brexit deal talks?

"Leo Durrington remains in a critical condition in hospital A teenager who drove into a boy in a hit-and-run crash told police he planned to hand himself in ""after watching Love Island"", a court heard. Leo Durrington, three, was flung 17 metres (55 ft) through the air when he was hit by a stolen Ford Transit, in Leigh, Greater Manchester, on Tuesday. At Wigan Youth Court, the teenager admitted causing serious injury by dangerous driving. Another boy, 15, admitted a charge of being carried in a stolen vehicle. The court heard a van was stolen on Monday and the 16-year-old was spotted driving it at about 10:00 GMT the next day in Leigh. It was followed by a police car and ""reacted"" by accelerating up to 50 or 60 mph and overtaking other vehicles, said James Gore, prosecuting. As the van made a right turn it left the road and mounted the pavement. Mr Gore said: ""On the footpath at that time is a mother and a three-year-old."" ""The mother is clipped by the wing mirror of the vehicle but the three-year-old is hit and ejected 17 metres [55 ft] into a nearby car park."" The van failed to stop and was later found abandoned, the court heard. The 15-year-old boy handed himself in to police that evening after contacting his solicitor. About two hours later a police officer went to the 16-year-old's home to arrest him. The defendant told the officer: ""It's all right, I was going to hand myself in after watching Love Island,"" the court heard. He later told police he did not see the youngster or his mother when he drove away. Greater Manchester Police said Leo was still in a critical condition in hospital. Police have released pictures of the van involved The older boy admitted failing to stop for police after a collision, driving without a licence and insurance and a handling a stolen vehicle. Neither of the teenagers can be named because of their ages. The 16-year-old had already been due in court on 15 November, accused of other motoring offences, before the crash involving the child, the court heard. Both boys will be sentenced on that date. Lawyers said the case cannot be transferred to the crown court so the maximum sentence the 16-year-old can face is two years' detention.

"Shareholders in the owner of struggling cafe chain Patisserie Valerie have vented their anger at the firm's chairman, despite backing his rescue plan for the business. At an emergency general meeting, more than 99% of shareholders backed a plan to issue Â£15m of new shares. However, investors in the 206-store chain harangued chairman Luke Johnson. They felt cheated that new investors are getting a share of the company at a knock-down price. Shareholders also accused Mr Johnson of ""holding a gun"" to their heads over the rescue deal. This video can not be played Patisserie Valerie shareholder Chris Boxall said the plan was the best outcome One shareholder, Heather Goddard, told the BBC: ""I felt closed off in the meeting and I didn't feel any questions were answered. ""I felt when he came in and started the meeting saying 99% of the votes in by proxy were in support of them, what he was basically saying to me was, 'You don't count.' ""When I asked him why there was there a gun to our head for this deadline... he didn't provide me with an answer I understood."" Simon Jack, business editor Ultimately, the shareholders had no choice. Approve a plan that will see new investors get shares at a massive discount to the existing owners - or see the company collapse, wiping out the value of their investment entirely. Serial entrepreneur Luke Johnson, who built Pizza Express and Feng Sushi into successful businesses and owned 37% of Patisserie Valerie, put Â£20m of his own money into the company in early October, when the chain was hours away from folding. That didn't stop small shareholders from being angry and feeling short-changed. There were bad-tempered exchanges at the company's emergency meeting. The sale of Â£15m in new shares will be used to pay Mr Johnson back Â£10m of his emergency loan. Many small investors told the BBC they backed the company because they trusted Mr Johnson. He said he would be stepping down from a significant number of other company boards to focus on reviving that trust and the company. With a forensic accounting probe and a Serious Fraud Office inquiry under way, that will be a full-time job. Mr Johnson was forced to lend Patisserie Holdings - which owns the Patisserie Valerie chain - Â£20m of his own money to prevent its collapse after directors said it required an immediate cash injection. He said on Thursday that the firm had been ""three hours from going into bankruptcy"", adding that he would be reducing his other commitments to focus on rescuing Patisserie Valerie. The chain is still fighting for survival after revealing last month it had uncovered ""significant, and potentially fraudulent, accounting irregularities"". Trading in the company's shares has been temporarily  halted. Finance director Chris Marsh is the subject of a criminal investigation. Mr Marsh was suspended when the problems were discovered, and he resigned from his position on 26 October. It has five brands: Patisserie Valerie, Druckers - Vienna Patisserie, Philpotts, Baker & Spice and Flour Power City.

"Removing foreign objects from ears and noses costs NHS hospitals in England almost Â£3m a year, a study suggests. Children were responsible for the vast majority of cases - 95% of objects removed from noses and 85% from ears. Annually an average of 1,218 nasal and 2,479 aural removals took place between 2010 and 2016, data shows. Jewellery was the most common foreign object requiring removal from children, while in adults, cotton buds proved to be the leading problem. Thepaper, titled Will Children Ever Learn?,externalis published in the The Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons. England's Hospital Episode Statistics show children aged one to four were the most likely to seek help for a foreign body in the nose.  Five to nine year olds attended A&E with something in their ear the most. Jewellery items accounted for up to 40% of cases in both the ear and noses of children. Paper and plastic toys were the items removed next most from noses, with cotton buds and pencils also found in  ears. The study said: ""The occurrence of foreign bodies in children is generally attributed to curiosity, a whim to explore orifices and accidental entry of the foreign body."" Its author, Dr Simon Morris, a specialist at Morriston Hospital in Swansea, said: ""Ask any ear, nose and throat surgeon, and they'll be able to tell you about weird and wonderful objects they have retrieved from the noses and ears of children and adults - pretty much anything that fits. ""Personally I've seen green peas, 'googly eyes' and polystyrene balls from bean-bags."" He said batteries can pose a particular danger. He added: ""Obviously prevention is better than a cure, which is why many toys contain warnings about containing small parts... But otherwise, recognising this early and seeking medical attention is important."" Leech up your nose? Not likely.. Man's bid to remove cockroach from ear.

"The threat posed by organised crime in the UK is now greater than terrorism, the National Crime Agency has said. Its latest report said there were 4,600 serious and organised crime groups, committing offences including child abuse, trafficking and drug dealing. Director general Lynne Owens said that crime cost the economy Â£37bn a year. Security Minister Ben Wallace said he wanted to target groups - such as accountants and estate agents - who launder money for the criminals. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that those at the ""bottom of the pyramid"", who were dealing drugs or laundering money for crime bosses - who he referred to as ""foot soldiers"" of organised crime - needed to face ""the same weight of the law"" as those at the top. The government,which has published a report into organised crime,external, will later announce a new strategy and Â£48m of public money to tackle the gangs. The last figure, published five years ago, showed the cost of such crimes was Â£24bn. Ms Owens said some of the cost was direct, such as the impact of blackmail on business, but others were indirect, including the impact on the mental health of victims. Threat from organised crime 'growing' The faces of those killed in London in 2018 I was a teenage 'money mule' She described the range of serious crimes that had changed rapidly in volume and complexity over the last five years. ""It means children being abused, the vulnerable being trafficked, it means cyber crime,"" she said. ""It means criminal markets that trade drugs, trade firearms, trade in people and make profit as a result."" She added: ""Each year it kills more of our citizens than terrorism, war and natural disasters combined."" Later, minister for Security and Economic Crime, Ben Wallace, will say: ""Many serious and organised criminals think they are above the law. ""They think they can defy the British state. And they think they are free to act with impunity against our businesses and our way of life. They are wrong. ""Our new strategic approach not only improves our government and law enforcement capabilities, but also ensures the private sector, the public and international partners are integrated as part of our response."" He will also announce Â£48m to fund the National Economic Crime Centre, training police fraud investigators, and extra data and intelligence capabilities.

"Children who missed an earlier MMR vaccination can have a ""catch-up"" jab People who believe the myths spread by anti-vaccine campaigners ""are absolutely wrong"", England's top doctor has said. Prof Dame Sally Davies said the MMR vaccine was safe and had been given to millions of children worldwide but uptake was currently ""not good enough"". In England, 87% of children receive two doses but the target is 95%. The chief medical officer urged parents to get their children vaccinated and ignore ""social media fake news"". Her comments come on the 30th anniversary of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine being introduced in the UK. This video can not be played The BBC investigated in 2018 why there's been a measles outbreak in Europe She said myths peddled about the dangers of vaccines on social media was one reason parents weren't taking their children to get the MMR vaccine. ""A number of people, stars, believe these myths - they are wrong,"" she said. ""Over these 30 years, we have vaccinated millions of children. ""It is a safe vaccination - we know that - and we've saved millions of lives across the world. ""People who spread these myths, when children die they will not be there to pick up the pieces or the blame."" Prof Dame Sally Davies said people should not be taken in by vaccine myths on social media The MMR vaccine has dramatically reduced cases of measles, mumps and rubella and saved about 4,000 deaths from measles, resulting in the UK being declared""measles free"" by the World Health Organizationlast year. This means the disease is no longer native to the UK, although cases do still occur. However, Dame Sally said there had been too many cases of measles in England this year - 903 so far, and young people who had missed out on the MMR vaccine had been particularly affected. Uptake of the MMR vaccine had reached a good level in previous years but has now dropped back to 87%. ""That means a lot of protection but it doesn't give us herd immunity,"" Dame Sally said. ""So when people from abroad have been coming in, travelling infected, it is spreading into our local communities."" The MMR vaccine,externalis given on the NHS as a single injection to babies, usually within a month of their first birthday. They then have a second injection before starting school, when three years old. Children who missed an earlier MMR vaccination can have a ""catch-up"" jab on the NHS. Single measles, mumps and rubella vaccines are available but not on the NHS in the UK. Two doses of the MMR vaccine are given to children before they start school in the UK In 1998, a study by former doctor Andrew Wakefield incorrectly linked the MMR vaccine to autism. The research is now completely discredited. But it had an impact on the coverage of the vaccine, which dropped to about 80% in the late 1990s and a low of 79% in 2003. Numerous public health campaigns have increased uptake in the years since.

"This video can not be played Divers find Lion Air plane 'black box' A ""black box"" recorder from Lion Air flight JT 610 has been found by divers off the coast of Indonesia. The plane, carrying 189 people, crashed soon after taking off from Jakarta, the Indonesian capital, on Monday. It plummeted into the Java Sea - no survivors have been found, nor has the body of the Boeing 737. There is as yet no indication of what caused the crash but the aircraft is believed to have experienced technical problems on its previous flight. The plane was making a one-hour journey to the western city of Pangkal Pinang when it went down. The pilot had asked air traffic control for permission to turn back to the airport but then contact was lost. Lion Air crash: Images of the unfolding tragedy Social media identifies crash couple Initial reports said the plane's flight data recorder had been found but a transport safety official quoted by Reuters news agency said later it was unclear whether the damaged device was the flight data unit or the cockpit voice recorder. ""Tonight we will move as quickly as possible to download what is in this black box,"" Haryo Satmiko, deputy chief of Indonesia's transportation safety committee, told journalists. It could take up to six months to analyse data from the black boxes, officials from Indonesia's transportation safety committee have said. Mr Satmiko pointed to the device's poor condition as evidence of the ""extraordinary impact"" of the crash. A diver identified as Hendra said the box had been buried in debris on the floor of the Java Sea. Another official, Muhammad Syaugi, said part of the plane's landing gear had been found, AFP news agency reports. ""We have found bigger parts of the plane than we have seen in previous days,"" he added. A log obtained by the BBCshows the plane experienced technical problems while flying from Bali to Jakarta the previous day. The log shows one instrument was giving ""unreliable"" airspeed readings and the captain had to hand over to the first officer. Altitude readings also differed on the captain's and first officer's instruments. Lion Air, a budget airline based in Indonesia, has acknowledged a technical problem occurred on the penultimate flight but said it was resolved ""according to procedure"". The company has sacked its technical director, Muhammad Asif. Representatives from Boeing are also meeting Indonesian officials as part of the investigation. Meanwhile, search officials are continuing the grim task of gathering body parts found at the crash site and taking them to land for identification. On Wednesday night, the funeral was held of the first identified victim, a 24-year-old woman who worked in the engineering ministry.

"Stella Creasy is urging other MPs to support her changes to the upskirting ban A review is to take place into whether misogynistic conduct should be treated as a hate crime, following Labour MP Stella Creasy's call to change the law. The move was announced during a debate on proposed legislation to criminalise upskirting in England and Wales. The Law Commission will review how sex and gender characteristics are treated within existing hate crime laws and whether new offences are needed. Ms Creasy said it sent a message to ""young women we are on their side"". On Wednesday, MPs approved the Voyeurism Bill, which would ban the taking of unsolicited pictures under someone's clothing, known as upskirting, in England and Wales. Proposals to create a new criminal offence, which is already on the statute book in Scotland, will now be considered by the House of Lords. Upskirting law to be passed soon, says May Misogyny hate crime pilot 'shocking' 'Upskirting': It happened to me Ms Creasy, the MP for Walthamstow, wanted to amend the draft law to allow judges to take into account whether people convicted of hate crimes against women should get a tougher sentence if it was ""motivated"" by misogyny or if misogyny was deemed to be an aggravating factor. Misogyny involves showing dislike, contempt or ingrained prejudice against women. This video can not be played ""He was laughing"": Three women share their experience of upskirting Justice Minister Lucy Frazer said the Voyeurism Bill was not the right vehicle for seeking such a change in the law but said she sympathised with Ms Creasy's views. She said ministers would fund a review into the ""coverage and approach"" of hate crime laws. ""We, as a government, are concerned our hate crime legislation is up to date and consistent. ""This review will include how protected characteristics, including sex and gender characteristics, should be considered by new or existing hate crime law."" Ms Creasy said the government's commitment to review existing laws and consider whether there was a need for new offences sent a hugely positive signal. ""For the first time we are now saying as a country that misogyny is not a part of life, it is something that shouldn't be tolerated, and it is something we are going to tackle,"" she said. ""We have just sent a message to every young woman in this country that we are on their side."" She has called for an extension of a pilot project by Nottinghamshire Police, which has for two years been recording misogynistic behaviour as either hate crime or hate incidents, depending on whether or not it is criminal. Intimidating behaviour and unwanted sexual advances are also seen as misogyny hate crime Nottinghamshire Police, which has beenrecording misogyny as a hate crime since 2016, defines misogyny as ""incidents against women that are motivated by the attitude of men towards women and includes behaviour targeted at women by men simply because they are women"". Examples include sexual assault, indecent exposure, groping, taking unwanted photographs on mobiles, upskirting, online abuse, being followed home, whistling, sexually explicit language, threatening/aggressive/intimidating behaviour, and unwanted sexual advances. However, not all hate crimes are criminal offences according to the legal definition.

"This video can not be played The US president said a third of Americans believed ""fake news"" media was ""the enemy of the people"" US President Donald Trump has launched a fresh assault on the US media, saying he has ""forcefully condemned hatred and bigotry"" but this goes unreported. Speaking at a rally in Florida ahead of next week's mid-term elections, he said a third of Americans believed that fake news was ""the enemy of the people"". He did not provide evidence for this. Critics accuse him of fomenting violence by using extreme and divisive rhetoric against opponents, the media, immigrants and Muslims. Earlier this week Mr Trump offered condolences at a synagogue in Pennsylvania where 11 Jewish worshippers were shot dead at the weekend. Hundreds protested against his visit. A stark choice facing President Trump Pittsburgh shooting: Who were the victims? The White House has rejected any blame over the attack at the Tree of Life temple in Pittsburgh and the alleged gunman was not a Trump supporter. However, a man arrested last week in connection witha mail-bombing campaign aimed at critics of Mr Trumphad pictures of the president covering the windows of his van. Addressing supporters in Estero, Mr Trump told them that the ""far-left"" media ""doesn't want you to hear your story"". ""We have forcefully condemned hatred, bigotry, racism and prejudice in all of its ugly forms,"" he said. ""But the media doesn't want you to hear your story, it's not my story, it's your story. Why Trump attacks the media How 'enemies' remark echoes tyrants ""And that's why thirty-three percent of the people in this country believe the fake news is in fact, and I hate to say this, in fact the enemy of the people."" He did not provide a source for this figure, but one poll from earlier this year showed thatjust under a third of people agreed with the idea that the media is the enemy of the people.,external This video can not be played Fox v MSNBC: How the news divides America Mr Trump has regularly accused some sections of the media of misrepresenting his administration's work. In Julythe publisher of the New York Times urged him to stop calling reporters ""enemies of the people"", saying it would ""lead to violence"" against the media. A gunman entered the Tree of Life temple during a service and fatally shot eight men and three women in what is thought to be the worst anti-Semitic attack in recent US history. The suspect, who also wounded four police officers and was shot by them several times, has been named as Robert Bowers and faces 44 charges. There were protests during President Trump's Pittsburgh visit He had previously posted anti-Semitic content on the social network Gab and had also attacked Mr Trump, whom he called ""a globalist, not a nationalist"". Voters are choosing new members of Congress, but how they vote will affect how the rest of Mr Trump's presidency turns out. Both houses of Congress are currently controlled by Mr Trump's Republican Party. A really simple guide to the US mid-terms Are people being barred from voting in US? The Democrats think they can win control of the House of Representatives this year by winning a majority of seats. Doing so would let them block or delay the president's plans by refusing to enact them. Some opinion polls put the Democrats ahead in many places.

"The report calls on the country to treat sex abuse as a crime North Korean officials commit sexual abuse against women with near total impunity, according to a report from rights group Human Rights Watch (HRW). HRW said such abuse is so common it has become part of ordinary life. The report is based on interviews with 62 North Koreans who fled the country,externaland provided detailed accounts of rape and sexual abuse. The group said it revealed a culture of open, unaddressed abuse, particularly from men in positions of power. ""They consider us [sex] toys. We are at the mercy of men,"" Oh Jung-hee, a former trader in her 40s told the report's authors. ""Sometimes, out of nowhere, you cry at night and don't know why."" Gathering information from inside the secretive state is extremely difficult and reports like this are rare. According to HRW some women said that sexual abuse had become so normalised that they did not think it was ""unusual"" - with some saying it had become accepted as part of everyday life. A lack of sexual education and an unchecked abuse of power by the perpetrators were some of many factors that has led to this mentality, the report added. Perpetrators include high-ranking party officials, prison facility guards, police and soldiers. Human Rights Watch released depictions of the abuse along with the report Interviewees told the group that when an official ""picked"" a woman, she would have little choice but to comply. This happened to one woman, who was being questioned by a police official in a pre-trial detention facility, after she was caught fleeing North Korea. ""He made me sit very close to him... [and] also touched me between the legs ...several times during different days,"" said Park Young-hee. ""My life was in his hands, so I did everything he wanted. How could I do anything else?"" HRW called for North Korea to ""acknowledge the problem of sexual violence"" and ensure that it was ""treated as a crime"". A UN Report in 2014 had earlier concluded that ""systematic, widespread and gross human rights violations"" had been committed by the North Korean government. It added that forced abortion, rape and sexual violence had been carried out in prisons or in detention.

"The threat posed by organised crime in the UK is now greater than terrorism, the National Crime Agency has said. Its latest report said there were 4,600 serious and organised crime groups, committing offences including child abuse, trafficking and drug dealing. Director general Lynne Owens said that crime cost the economy Â£37bn a year. Security Minister Ben Wallace said he wanted to target groups - such as accountants and estate agents - who launder money for the criminals. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that those at the ""bottom of the pyramid"", who were dealing drugs or laundering money for crime bosses - who he referred to as ""foot soldiers"" of organised crime - needed to face ""the same weight of the law"" as those at the top. The government,which has published a report into organised crime,external, will later announce a new strategy and Â£48m of public money to tackle the gangs. The last figure, published five years ago, showed the cost of such crimes was Â£24bn. Ms Owens said some of the cost was direct, such as the impact of blackmail on business, but others were indirect, including the impact on the mental health of victims. Threat from organised crime 'growing' The faces of those killed in London in 2018 I was a teenage 'money mule' She described the range of serious crimes that had changed rapidly in volume and complexity over the last five years. ""It means children being abused, the vulnerable being trafficked, it means cyber crime,"" she said. ""It means criminal markets that trade drugs, trade firearms, trade in people and make profit as a result."" She added: ""Each year it kills more of our citizens than terrorism, war and natural disasters combined."" Later, minister for Security and Economic Crime, Ben Wallace, will say: ""Many serious and organised criminals think they are above the law. ""They think they can defy the British state. And they think they are free to act with impunity against our businesses and our way of life. They are wrong. ""Our new strategic approach not only improves our government and law enforcement capabilities, but also ensures the private sector, the public and international partners are integrated as part of our response."" He will also announce Â£48m to fund the National Economic Crime Centre, training police fraud investigators, and extra data and intelligence capabilities.

"This video can not be played Chief Constable Sara Thornton: ""The reality is we can't just do everything"" Police should focus on burglary and violent crime and not incidents such as misogyny where no offence has been committed, a senior officer has said. Chief Constable Sara Thornton said forces were too stretched to deal with ""deserving"" issues, such as logging hate incidents against women. Claims against dead people were also taking resources from tackling ""today's crime today"", she told a conference. She called for a ""refocus on core policing"". Speaking to police chiefs and police and crime commissioners, Ms Thornton expressed concern abouta review into whether misogyny should be treated as a hate crime. Misogyny is the hatred, dislike or prejudice against women. Ms Thornton, chair of the National Police Chiefs' Council, said that while ""treating misogyny as a hate crime is a concern for some well-organised campaigning organisations"", forces ""do not have the resources to do everything"". She added: ""I want us to solve more burglaries and bear down on violence before we make more records of incidents that are not crimes"", adding she hoped the review ""takes account of the pressure on forces before suggesting the law is changed"". Reality Check: Have police priorities changed? Misogyny could become hate crime after review Police risk becoming 'irrelevant', MPs warn Ms Thornton, the former head of Thames Valley Police, highlightedHome Office statistics,externalpublished last week that showed arrests in England and Wales have halved in the last decade. She told the conference: ""We are asked to provide more and more bespoke services that are all desirable - but the simple fact is there are too many desirable and deserving issues."" She added: ""Neither investigating gender-based hate crime or investigating allegations against those who have died are necessarily bad things - I just argue that they cannot be priorities for a service that is over-stretched."" But Sue Fish, the former chief constable of Nottinghamshire Police, which has been reporting incidents of misogyny as a hate crime for the past two years, told BBC Radio 4's The World at One that Ms Thornton's comments were ""shameful"". She said: ""We're reinforcing that women are not worthy or any sort of service from the police,"" she said, adding that historically, police treatment of female victims of rape and domestic violence had been ""appalling"". Since 2010 police chiefs say funding in England and Wales has decreased, in real terms, by nearly a fifth, and there are 20,000 fewer officers. Richard Garside, director of the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies, said Ms Thornton's intervention comes as the governmentseeks to improve the investigation and reporting of hate crimes,external. ""She's trying to send a message back to government, saying, 'look you're trying to get us to do more and more, well how on earth are we supposed to do all of this and also focus on the core activities,'"" he said. Security minister Ben Wallace said police should prioritise resources based on the level of harm caused by a crime, and forces were free to make these decisions as they saw fit. He added that hate crimes were still important and in some cases could spark other problems such as exploitation and community friction. Speaking at the conference, Home Secretary Sajid Javid acknowledged police were ""feeling stretched"" but promised forces would have the resources they needed by 2019-2020. But shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said forces could not do ""more with less"". Police should not have to ""pick and choose"" between crimes, and if misogyny was made a hate crime the government must provide the funding to tackle it, she added.

"National Crime Agency officers searching a car in April Organised crime affects more people in the UK than any other security threat, says the National Crime Agency. It warns the scale and complexity of organised crime groups is growing, driven by global movements of people and new technologies like encryption. It estimates there are 4,629 crime groups in the UK, with many offences under-reported. It says that more firearms have been arriving as gangs work across borders to smuggle them from Europe. In its annual report, the NCA says the breadth of threats from serious organised crime groups means the police and other agencies must increasingly think differently about how to combat the thousands of gangs. Watch: Car of Glasgow gangster pursued by police helicopter 'Merciless' organised crime gang jailed I was a teenage 'money mule' - BBC News ""This year's assessment shows that organised crime groups (OCGs) are exploiting digital technology, for instance using encryption to communicate, and dark web marketplaces to aid their activities,"" said Lynne Owen, the NCA's director general. ""Criminals are continuing to develop international connections to increase the reach of their activity, and to maximise profits. ""The increasing sophistication of crime groups, coupled with the changing nature of their geographical reach, demonstrates more than ever the requirement for an increasingly co-ordinated response,"" she said. By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent Organised crime was once just about things that were easy to understand and relatively easy to see: drugs; gun smuggling; extortion and armed robbery, to name but a few. Today's annual report from the NCA is sombre reading because it underlines how modern-day crime connects events very close to your home to a global marketplace. If a group can find an illicit way to make a profit, they will try to do so - they're not fussy. Modern communications are making these crimes easier, lowering the entry levels for start-up gangs - and the global movement of people, cash and goods can make the trail go cold before investigators have cracked the secret communications. These changes to organised crime are happening faster than policing tactics can evolve - and many experts believe, as the rise of cyber and human trafficking has shown, things are going to get worse before they get better. The report predicts modern slavery, such as where someone has been coerced into working illegally in cash businesses such as car washes, would continue to grow - but also change. If immigration falls, the number of illegal immigrants and British citizens tricked into these conditions could grow. Many threats remain largely hidden from the public as gangs use the the ""dark web"" and readily-available encryption tools to conceal their activities, said the agency. These include billions of pounds in money laundering, fraud and attempts to blackmail businesses by launching cyber attacks on their networks. Beyond cyber offences, encrypted communication apps were now being used by all types of organised crime gangs, it said. The NCA also warned the UK remains a ""prime destination"" for money laundering from Russia, Nigeria and Pakistan - with the London property market being regularly exploited. While the UK still has one of the lowest levels of firearms offences in the world, the NCA said it was concerned about the smuggling of weapons from Eastern Europe via Belgium and the Netherlands. ""The vast majority of criminal firearm discharges in 2016/17... involved weapons not previously discharged in crime, suggesting a sufficiently fluid supply,"" said the report. ""This trend is assessed as largely due to firearms entering the UK from overseas and previously legal weapons entering criminal hands after being stolen, diverted or modified within the UK."" The UK's 3,000 air fields also presented ""opportunities"" for groups smuggling in both people and drugs. In turn, the UK's drug market was substantially changing with gangs developing so-called ""county lines"" networks in which products are illicitly moved from cities to smaller communities via orders placed on untraceable mobile phones.

"""Have you ever held Â£2,000 at once in your hand?"" that was the line used to tempt Holly into becoming a money mule. At the age of 17 and still at school, Holly (not her real name) was approached on Instagram, then Snapchat, by a person who promised to pay her a decent sum, if she let him use her bank account to move money. Even though she knew this was suspicious, Holly eventually handed over her bank card to a young man who was essentially a stranger. ""He was convincing me. He showed me other people that he's worked with about how much money they got and he just kept on pestering me for my card and I just eventually gave in,"" she toldBBC Radio 4's Money Box programme. The deal was apparently simple. Holly would receive money into her bank account and then transfer it to another account or take it out in cash and give it to someone. In exchange she would get a cut of the money. But by becoming a money mule, what Holly was really doing was laundering the proceeds of crime. It's a serious offence, and if caught money mules could get a maximum sentence of 14 years in prison. Criminals are recruiting young people under 21 to carry out money laundering Holly is by no means alone in doing this. According to Cifas, the UK's fraud prevention service, in 2017 its UK member banks identified 8,500 money mule accounts owned by people under the age of 21 - some owned by teenagers as young as 14. What's worrying is that young people under the age of 21 are the fastest growing age group being recruited by criminals to launder money in this way, up 36% on 2016. Holly's story shows how common it is becoming. ""It's like an everyday thing for me, it's normalised where I am. Because the way it's around me, I forget that it's even illegal, what everybody's doing."" People who let their accounts be used for fraud could be denied banking services for six years Holly describes how the people around her, the ""Fraud boys"" or ""Fraud stars"" as they're called, have developed a unique language on social media to tempt people in. ""I see it on my social media, people asking who has this card, who has that card. For Barclays, they say Barks, for NatWest they say Natty, for Santander they say Sants. ""They call cards squares. So who has a Natty square, 5K drop, which is basically Â£5,000 will be put in your account, and you'll get a cut."" In Holly's case, her card fell into the hands of a man who put Â£1,500 into her account, under a fake company name. Holly was instructed to go into the bank and withdraw the full amount. But things didn't go to plan. The bank started asking her detailed questions about the company that she had to pretend she worked for, and then they asked to see the manager of the fake company in person, to verify that he had put in the money. The whole time, the man organising the fraud was standing across the road looking in, and communicating with Holly by text, telling her what to say. ""I was nervous and, sort of scared, in case the bank man caught me out there and then. I never knew really what to say but I just had to lie and use my common sense or to think of something."" The fraud didn't work and Holly left the bank empty-handed. But then consequences of what she had tried to do kicked in. First, she lost her bank account entirely. The police are working hard to identify the criminals behind the money laundering Then when she tried to apply to different high street banks they wouldn't accept her. ""Then that's when I sort of realised I could have been black-listed. I called one of them up they said 'there's a tag or message on your record'."" The message Holly is talking about is a Cifas ""first party fraud"" marker, which flags up the fact that her account was used for fraud to other banks. The marker will stay with her for six years and Holly is already struggling with having no access to banking. ""You don't realise how much you need a card or bank account until you actually don't have one."" she says. ""It's hard for me to apply for jobs because some jobs say that you need your bank account to get an interview. I can't buy things online, I always need to give money to somebody and say, 'can you do this, can you buy that, can you buy this online for me?'"" Holly currently works part-time, where she gets paid by cheques. She cashes these in at The Money Shop, which charges an 8% rate and a handling fee, meaning she loses money each time. Being locked out of banking is one punishment facing young people who make the mistake of becoming money mules, but what are the chances of going to prison? The Metropolitan Police started looking at the issue in March last year and since then has been working to identify the criminals behind the money laundering and the so-called ""fraud boy"" recruiters to get them arrested and prosecuted. Police are seeking to target the fraudsters behind the scams, rather than the mules themselves Detective Chief Inspector Gary Miles from Metropolitan Police's Fraud and Linked Crime Online unit recognises that the problem is growing at a very alarming rate. His team have sent letters and police officers around to schools, warning them of the danger. ""It is not a problem we are going to arrest our way out of,"" he says. ""We don't want to give a whole young generation convictions when maybe they're at the start of their life and they've actually made a mistake. What we actually want to do is give them the knowledge, the skills and the powers to stop them making those decisions in the first place."" As for Holly, she feels angry with the people who got her involved, but mainly she feels angry with herself. ""I heard of people doing it and nothing had happened to them so I thought it wasn't going to happen to me. But it's my fault really. ""I just should have listened to my friends. They told me don't do it.  I'm going to have to live with it for six years now.""

"The UK has struck a deal with the EU on post-Brexit financial services, according to unconfirmed reports. The Times newspaper said London had agreed in talks with Brussels to give UK financial services firms continued access to the bloc. The pound has risen 1% against the dollar in response. But a government source said that was ""a rather rose-tinted interpretation of where we have got to"". The source told the BBC: ""People shouldn't get ahead of themselves."" The Times said in its report that an initial deal on exchange of data had also been agreed. It added the deal was expected to be completed within three weeks. Sterling rose on hopes of an agreement, with the pound up by more than a cent against the dollar at $1.2887. Britain's departure from the European Union is expected to take place in March next year,but many UK-based businesses have expressed concern over the lack of progress in Brexit talks. UK firms 'near point of no return' At-a-glance: The UK's four Brexit options Brexit divorce cost 'uncertain' Despite various reassurances from Prime Minister Theresa May that definite trade terms between firms in the UK and the EU will be finalised by March next year, businesses across the boardare already preparing for the worst. Mrs May's senior adviser on Europe, Oliver Robbins, was continuing the negotiations in Brussels, The Times said. Dominic O'Connell, Today programme business presenter Equivalence - the apparent basis of Theresa May's reported deal with Brussels on financial services - sounds like a cuddly continuation of what the City has now. It is not. In this context, equivalence is a legal term describing the regime the EU uses when dealing with countries outside its boundaries. The EU grants equivalence to other states if it can be persuaded that its rules are the same as the ones set by Brussels. Equivalence, and the trading rights that come with it, can be withdrawn at any time. That is why when one of the big City law firms, Hogan Lovells, was asked to look at equivalence by the City UK, the trade body for the Square Mile, its conclusion was that it did not ""provide a long-term sustainable solution"". What we do not know, however, is whether Mrs May has managed to negotiate some kind of ""equivalence-plus"",  with the kind of safeguards that would ease City fears. In any event, reports of any kind of deal were enough to rally sterling, and even those unhappy with the idea of equivalence would concede that it is probably better than no deal at all. According to the newspaper's report, the deal means that after Brexit, UK financial services companies will be able to operate within the EU as they do now. The Times said the EU would accept that the UK had ""equivalent"" regulations to Brussels and would therefore be allowed market access. However, there has been no official confirmation of the report. Thomas Moore, investment director of UK equities at Aberdeen Standard Investments, told the BBC's Today programme that if true, ""I think on balance, it's positive."" He said the granting of equivalence, much desired by the City, ""produces much greater certainty, not just for financial companies"". What's the latest on the Brexit deal talks?

"Edinburgh and Aberdeen are among the top 10 places to live and work, according to an index of UK cities. Across the UK this year's index shows a continuing gap between the highest performing cities of Oxford and Reading and the lowest ranking, Swansea and Sunderland. The Scottish capital has slipped from fourth to sixth, as housing affordability has caused challenges. Aberdeen climbed from 11 to nine in the rankings, with Glasgow at 25. The Good Growth for Cities Index, run by PwC, measures the performance of 42 of the UK's largest towns and cities. The index aims to show there is more to life, work and general wellbeing than simply measuring GDP. Oxford Reading Southampton Milton Keynes Bristol Edinburgh Swindon Coventry Aberdeen Leicester The 42 cities are measured against 10 indicators based on public views of what is key to economic success and wellbeing. In UK terms, even the cities towards the bottom of the index have improved significantly with Swansea demonstrating the greatest improvements in employment and environmental factors. PwC Scotland's Lindsay Gardiner said: ""Edinburgh remains one of the best cities in the UK to live and do business. ""The announcement of the Â£1.3bn City Deal for the region will help the city futureproof itself in a world being rapidly altered by technology. ""While Edinburgh continues to perform above average in fields like jobs, income and skills, this index highlights some challenges, not least of which is housing affordability. This provides evidence that Edinburgh is paying the price of its success."" The report found Aberdeen is bouncing back after the oil and gas industry downturn Kevin Reynard, senior partner for PwC in Aberdeen, said: ""There has been much talk about Aberdeen's recovery from the downturn in the oil and gas industry, and this year's index reinforces that this recovery is gaining momentum. ""We are now beginning to see the positive effects of the higher range of oil prices. ""What is more encouraging is to see Aberdeen return to the top 10 cities in the UK. With the city the best performing in Scotland in six of 12 measures used, it is clear Aberdeen is a fantastic city with much to offer."" According to the index, employment, health, income and skills are held to be the most important factors. Housing affordability, commuting times, environmental factors and income inequality were also included, as was the number of new business start-ups. Scotland's poorest performing variable was health, with all Scottish cities at or below the UK average. Work-life balance, as defined by the percentage of those working more than 45 hours per week, has seen an improvement. New businesses, job creation, skills development and work-life balance have been the key long-term drivers of growth in Scotland's largest cities since the financial crisis. Despite being in the bottom half of the index, Glasgow was above average in job-creation, skills and work-life balance as above average as compared to the rest of the 42 UK cities in the index. Nevertheless, the latest edition shows all three main Scottish cities outperforming the UK in terms of jobs, skills, income and environment. David Brown, head of government and public sector for PwC in Scotland, said: ""Scotland's cities are in a stronger position today than prior to the financial downturn, and that is thanks to the country having continued to invest in jobs and skills."" Mr Brown added: ""There remain challenges in our cities, however. There is a widening gap between earnings and house prices, which keeps owner occupier rates down. ""Scotland continues to score either at or below average when it comes to health."" With 10 years of data to draw upon, the index can chart a decade of changes across Scotland's cities since the global economic downturn. Edinburgh and Glasgow have increased their index scores by 0.31 and 0.45 respectively since 2005-07, well ahead of the UK average increase of 0.29 - driven, according to the report, by an improvement in skills among 25 to 64-year-olds. Glasgow has seen a improvement in the new businesses, jobs and health variables. Edinburgh has also seen an improvement in new businesses compared with 10 years ago, however the city has seen a widening of the gap between house prices and earnings.

"The balance of education spending has shifted from giving a bigger share to the poor rather than the rich There has been a ""remarkable shift"" in poorer children now receiving a bigger share of education spending in England, says the Institute for Fiscal Studies. The independent financial researchers say in previous generations children from richer families were the main beneficiaries, as they were likely to stay longer in education. But this pattern has been reversed by policies deliberately ""skewed"" to give more funding towards the deprived and with more poorer youngsters going to sixth form and university, it says. The analysis reveals that poorer pupils who took their GCSEs in 2010 had almost Â£10,000 more spent on them during their school years than their richer counterparts. The following years, up to those leaving university in 2016, have been even more ""pro-poor"" in funding levels, says IFS research fellow, Luke Sibieta. ""This is a remarkable shift in the shape of public spending, with an increasing amount of redistribution taking place through public-service spending,"" says Mr Sibieta, By 2010, poorer pupils were getting almost Â£10,000 per head extra in average spending The IFS says that back in the 1980s and 1990s, better-off families would have taken the lion's share of public spending on education because their children were much more likely to benefit from continuing beyond the age of 16. This continued into the early 2000s, when the balance began to be shifted by a combination of extra funding aimed at disadvantaged pupils and increasing numbers of poorer families staying on for A-levels and then degrees. For those taking their GCSEs in 2003, there was still an advantage to the wealthy - with Â£6,000 more being spent on the richest fifth of pupils compared with the poorest. By 2010, policies to support the disadvantaged in school meant that poorer pupils were getting Â£9,500 more per head in spending. When this was combined with spending on sixth form, college and university, it meant that in 2010 both the richest and poorest had Â£73,000 spent on their education. The introduction of the pupil premium from 2010 onwards would have shifted the balance further towards supporting the poorest, the IFS says. Going to university has remained more likely among the wealthy, but Mr Sibieta says the public cost of university, even with loans for tuition fees, does not outweigh the overall balance of the poor getting a greater share of spending. This has seen poorer youngsters receiving 20% more spending on average in their school years than the richer pupils. ""This was the intended and direct result of reforms to the school funding system over the 2000s,"" says the study. ""In less than a decade over the 2000s, education spending shifted from being skewed towards richer pupils to being skewed towards poorer pupils instead,"" says Mr Sibieta. Sir Kevan Collins, chief executive of the Education Endowment Foundation, which researches ways to help disadvantaged pupils to catch up, said: ""The moral and educational case for additional support to underprivileged children remains as strong as ever. ""Young people from disadvantaged backgrounds are still much less likely than their classmates to leave school with the qualifications and skills they need to get on in life,"" he said. Paul Whiteman, leader of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: ""Unfortunately this only works if there is enough money in the system in total. ""At the moment all children are being short-changed by the government's real-terms cuts to education funding."" 'A century' to close disadvantage gap Do schools help or hinder social mobility?

"Hurricane Irma caused destruction across the BVI in September 2017 British overseas territories hit by natural disasters could get access to foreign aid under plans agreed by the richest nations, the BBC has learned. Some Caribbean islandsdamaged last year by hurricanesdid not get official development assistance because their national incomes were too high. After UK pressure, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has agreed a new mechanism. It would see them appear on the official list of poorer countries. This would mean the countries are eligible for official development assistance - known asODA,external. Until now, there was no procedure for middle income countries to register for ODA if they suffered an unexpected economic decline as a result of a natural disaster. What are the UK's commitments to overseas territories? International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt told the BBC the ""significant rule change"" was ""a major victory"" for the UK which now had ""more options in how it can help a nation recover and become more resilient to shocks"". In autumn 2017, the British overseas territories of Anguilla, Turks and Caicos and the British Virgin Islands were badly damaged by Hurricanes Irma and Maria. But there wascontroversy after the BBC revealed that Britain's Â£14bn aid budget could not be usedto help repair the islands. The money had to be found from other budgets. All three countries had gross national incomes higher than the benchmark set by the World Bank for countries to be eligible for ODA, set at a gross national income of less than $12,055 (Â£9,400) per capita. Those currently eligible for ODA include countries like Antigua and Barbuda, Dominican Republic and Cuba. But Anguilla and St Kitts & Nevis were taken off the ODA list in 2014, the British Virgin Islands in 2000, and the Turks and Caicos in 2008. The new mechanism would allow countries to be restored to the ODA list if they were hit by a natural disaster that devastated their economies. International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt described the previous rule as ""illogical"" The process of getting back onto the eligible list would take some months and would apply only to long-term reconstruction aid rather than short-term humanitarian relief. Ms Mordaunt said: ""The British public are strong supporters of providing help in the wake of disasters, including long-term reconstruction. ""They want to help people, especially when they are from nations we have close ties to. ""Not being able to pay for that help from the aid budget, because a nation's economy was doing well, before a hurricane, earthquake or other disaster hit, was illogical and had to change."" She said: ""Britain has never fallen short in our support of countries in need - either through sending aid, our armed forces or reconstruction support."" Ms Mordaunt said ""the public would agree that is what our aid budget should be used for"", adding: ""We will continue to press for further reforms to these important rules to ensure we are able to use the aid budget in the most sensible way.""

"Removing foreign objects from ears and noses costs NHS hospitals in England almost Â£3m a year, a study suggests. Children were responsible for the vast majority of cases - 95% of objects removed from noses and 85% from ears. Annually an average of 1,218 nasal and 2,479 aural removals took place between 2010 and 2016, data shows. Jewellery was the most common foreign object requiring removal from children, while in adults, cotton buds proved to be the leading problem. Thepaper, titled Will Children Ever Learn?,externalis published in the The Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons. England's Hospital Episode Statistics show children aged one to four were the most likely to seek help for a foreign body in the nose.  Five to nine year olds attended A&E with something in their ear the most. Jewellery items accounted for up to 40% of cases in both the ear and noses of children. Paper and plastic toys were the items removed next most from noses, with cotton buds and pencils also found in  ears. The study said: ""The occurrence of foreign bodies in children is generally attributed to curiosity, a whim to explore orifices and accidental entry of the foreign body."" Its author, Dr Simon Morris, a specialist at Morriston Hospital in Swansea, said: ""Ask any ear, nose and throat surgeon, and they'll be able to tell you about weird and wonderful objects they have retrieved from the noses and ears of children and adults - pretty much anything that fits. ""Personally I've seen green peas, 'googly eyes' and polystyrene balls from bean-bags."" He said batteries can pose a particular danger. He added: ""Obviously prevention is better than a cure, which is why many toys contain warnings about containing small parts... But otherwise, recognising this early and seeking medical attention is important."" Leech up your nose? Not likely.. Man's bid to remove cockroach from ear.

"The threat posed by organised crime in the UK is now greater than terrorism, the National Crime Agency has said. Its latest report said there were 4,600 serious and organised crime groups, committing offences including child abuse, trafficking and drug dealing. Director general Lynne Owens said that crime cost the economy Â£37bn a year. Security Minister Ben Wallace said he wanted to target groups - such as accountants and estate agents - who launder money for the criminals. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that those at the ""bottom of the pyramid"", who were dealing drugs or laundering money for crime bosses - who he referred to as ""foot soldiers"" of organised crime - needed to face ""the same weight of the law"" as those at the top. The government,which has published a report into organised crime,external, will later announce a new strategy and Â£48m of public money to tackle the gangs. The last figure, published five years ago, showed the cost of such crimes was Â£24bn. Ms Owens said some of the cost was direct, such as the impact of blackmail on business, but others were indirect, including the impact on the mental health of victims. Threat from organised crime 'growing' The faces of those killed in London in 2018 I was a teenage 'money mule' She described the range of serious crimes that had changed rapidly in volume and complexity over the last five years. ""It means children being abused, the vulnerable being trafficked, it means cyber crime,"" she said. ""It means criminal markets that trade drugs, trade firearms, trade in people and make profit as a result."" She added: ""Each year it kills more of our citizens than terrorism, war and natural disasters combined."" Later, minister for Security and Economic Crime, Ben Wallace, will say: ""Many serious and organised criminals think they are above the law. ""They think they can defy the British state. And they think they are free to act with impunity against our businesses and our way of life. They are wrong. ""Our new strategic approach not only improves our government and law enforcement capabilities, but also ensures the private sector, the public and international partners are integrated as part of our response."" He will also announce Â£48m to fund the National Economic Crime Centre, training police fraud investigators, and extra data and intelligence capabilities.

"Human activities are causing world temperatures to rise, posing serious threats to people and nature. Things are likely to worsen in the coming decades, but scientists argue urgent action can still limit the worst effects of climate change. Climate change is the long-term shift in the Earth's average temperatures and weather conditions. The world has been warming up quickly over the past 100 years or so. As a result, weather patterns are changing. Between 2014 and 2023, global temperatures were on average around 1.2C above those of the late 19th Century, according to the World Meteorological Organization. Since the 1980s, each decade has been warmer than the previous one, the UK Met Office says. The year 2024 is""virtually certain"" to end up as the world's hottest on record, according to the latest projections by the European climate service. The climate has changed naturally throughout the Earth's history. But natural causes cannot explain the particularly rapid warming seen over the last century, according to the UN's climate body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Thishas been caused by human activities, mainly the widespread use of fossil fuels - coal, oil and gas - in homes, factories and transport systems. When fossil fuels burn, they release greenhouse gases - mostly carbon dioxide (CO2). This CO2 acts like a blanket, trapping extra energy in the atmosphere near the Earth's surface. This causes the planet to heat up. Since the start of the Industrial Revolution - when humans started burning large amounts of fossil fuels - theamount of CO2 in the atmosphere has risen by about 50%,external, far above levels seen in the Earth's recent history. TheCO2 released from burning fossil fuels,externalhas a distinctive chemical fingerprint. This matches the type of CO2 increasingly found in the atmosphere. A global average temperature increase of 1.2C might not sound much. However, it has already had a huge effect on the environment, including: more frequent and intenseextreme weather, such as heatwaves and heavy rainfall rapid melting ofglaciersandice sheets, contributing to sea-level rise huge declines inArctic sea-ice warmer oceans, which can fuelmore intense storms and hurricanesand damage wildlife such ascoral reefs These changes are already having serious consequences for people and economies around the world. For example, Hurricanes Helene and Milton - which hit parts of the US in September and October 2024 - couldeach end up costing at least $50bn (Â£40bn),external, according to provisional estimates. More than 200 peoplewere killed by Helene, andat least 16 by Milton. The winds and rain from both storms wereworsened by climate change, according to scientists at the World Weather Attribution (WWA) group. Back in 2022, parts of East Africa suffered their worst drought for 40 years,putting more than 20 million people at risk of severe hunger. Climate change has made droughts like thisat least 100 times more likely, the WWA says. The particular vulnerabilities of individual communities across the globe determine who is affected by these extreme events, and how badly. The more the world warms, the worse the impacts of climate change become. Limiting long-term average temperature rises to 1.5Cis seen as particularly important. In alandmark agreement signed in Paris in 2015, almost 200 countries pledged to try to curb global warming to that amount. The reference to 1.5C is generally understood to mean a 20-year average, rather than an increase seen in any single year. The science is not completely certain, but according to the UN, theconsequences of 2C global warming versus 1.5C could include,external: extreme hot dayscould become on average 4C warmer at mid-latitudes (regions outside the poles and tropics), versus 3C at 1.5C sea-level risecould be around 0.1m higher than at 1.5C, exposing up to 10 million more people to events including more frequent flooding more than 99% ofcoral reefscould be lost, compared with 70-90% at 1.5C twice the number ofplants and vertebrates(animals with a backbone) could be exposed to unsuitable climate conditions across more than half their geographical area several hundred million morepeoplemay be exposed to climate-related risks and susceptible to poverty by 2050 than at 1.5C. The call to restrict temperature rise to 1.5C was partly designed to avoid crossing so-called ""tipping points"". It is not clear exactly where they sit, but once these thresholds are passed, changes could accelerate and become irreversible, such as the collapse of the Greenland Ice Sheet. The Earth's poles are especially vulnerable to rising temperatures About 3.3 to 3.6 billion people are highly vulnerable to climate change, according to the IPCC. People living in poorer countries are expected to suffer most as they have fewer resources to adapt. This has led to questions about fairness, becausethese places have typically only been responsible for a small percentage of greenhouse gas emissions,external. However, knock-on impacts could be felt over wide areas. For example, crop failures linked to extreme weather could raise global food prices. To help keep global warming to the 1.5C limit agreed in Paris in 2015, CO2 emissions need to be""net zero""by 2050, the UN says. This means reducing greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible, and actively removing any remaining emissions from the atmosphere. Mostcountries have, or are considering, net zero targets,external. However, greenhouse gas levels are still rising quickly and the world is ""likely"" to warm beyond 1.5C, the IPCC says. However, there has beenprogress in some areas, such as the growth of renewable energy and electric vehicles. World leaders meet every year to discuss their climate commitments. At the most recent COP29 summit in Azerbaijan in November 2024,richer countries committed to giving developing nations at least $300bn(about Â£240bn) a year by 2035 to help them tackle climate change. However, this is far less than the amount poorer countries say they need. Many countries had also hoped thatthe deal struck in 2023to ""transition away from fossil fuels in energy systems"" would be strengthened, but that did not happen.

"As well as rapidly reducing the carbon dioxide that we humans are pumping into the atmosphere in huge amounts, recent scientific assessments of climate change have all suggested that cutting emissions alone will not be enough to keep global temperatures from rising more than 1.5 or 2 degrees C. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and others have all stated that extracting CO2 from the air will be needed if we are to bend the rising temperature curve before the end of this century. These ideas are controversial with some seeing them as a distraction from the pressing business of limiting emissions of CO2. 'Step forward' in sucking CO2 from air Climate's magic rabbit: Pulling CO2 out of thin air Buta new assessment,externalfrom the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine says that some of these ""negative emissions technologies"" are ready to be deployed, on a large scale, right now. The authors point to the fact that the US Congress has recently passed the 45Q tax rule, which gives a $50 tax credit for every tonne of CO2 that's captured and stored. So their study highlights some technologies that are available at between $20 and $100 per tonne. This report says that there is a lot of potential for increasing the amount of carbon that is stored in living plants and sediments found in the marshy lands near the sea shore and on the edges of river estuaries. They include mangroves, tidal areas and seagrass beds. Together, these wetlands contain the highest carbon stocks per unit area of any ecosystem. Mangroves like these are an important carbon store The National Academies study says that by creating new wetlands and restoring and protecting these fringe areas, there is the potential to more than double the current rate of carbon extracted from the atmosphere. What's more the study says that this is quite a cheap option, where carbon can be captured for around $20 a tonne. The downsides, though, are that these coastal ecosystems are some of the most threatened areas on Earth, with an estimated 340,000 to 980,000 hectares being destroyed each year. When you degrade these areas, instead of soaking up CO2 they themselves become significant sources of the gas. Other problems are that rising seas around the world might swamp and destroy marsh lands. Another restriction is that there just aren't enough coastal areas. ""Although coastal engineering is very expensive, coastal blue carbon is probably about the lowest cost option that we've got,"" said Prof Stephen Pacala, from Princeton University, who chaired the report. ""The problem is that the total capacity is not that large."" Global deforestation has been a significant factor in driving up emissions of carbon, so researchers feel that planting new trees or restoring lost areas is a simple and cheap technology that could be expanding right now. One of the problems, though, is that while researchers understand a good deal about which trees are best to grow for timber harvesting, they are less knowledgeable about breeding trees whose major focus is to remove carbon from the atmosphere. Planting trees on degraded land is seen as important for removing carbon Almost every country has embarked on tree planting as a cheap way of curbing carbon  - the report says that is all very useful as long as trees are planted on degraded land. ""The problem is when you try and scale this up to the scale that's required, you start competing with land for food production,"" said Dr Phil Renforth from Cardiff University, UK, who reviewed the report. ""So there is certainly going to be a need for other things within this space as well."" The report says that this can also be done for $20 per tonne of CO2, or less. The study also calls for more research to develop crop plants that take up and sequester more carbon in soils. How forests are managed can have a big impact on how much carbon they store As well as planting more trees, the report says that we need to manage our existing forests in a better way to remove more carbon. This can also be done for less than $20 per tonne of CO2. Techniques can include the speedy re-stocking of forests after disturbances like fires. They can also involve extending the age of the forest when you harvest it. A critical step would be to extend the amount of timber that goes into long-lived wooden products and limiting the amount that gets burned as biomass in power stations. The report says that some simple changes in the way farmers manage their land can be a cheap and effective way of removing carbon from the air. These include planting cover crops when fields aren't being used to grow commercial crops. It means growing crops with reduced tillage and it will involve adding a material called biochar, a type of charcoal made from plant matter, to the land. Making biochar in a pit, which can help soils store more carbon ""Changing agricultural management practices offers tremendous benefits in terms of soil fertility and water, but there are some challenges,"" said Kelly Levin, an expert on carbon removal from the World Resources Institute. ""These include the key question of how permanent is that carbon retention. There is always the challenge of scale. If these practices are to mean anything you have to implement them over a very large area."" This is a more expensive option, says the report, at between $20 and $100 per tonne of CO2. The idea of BECCS is to grow energy crops that soak up carbon, which are then burned to create electricity while the emitted CO2 gas is captured and buried permanently underground. BECCS has been dismissed by many because of the massive amounts of land that would be needed, up to 40% of global cropland according to some studies. Crops like willow can be grown to be burned for energy with the emissions captured and stored underground But this new report says that BECCS can make a difference and at a reasonable cost - between $20 and $100 per tonne. It says that just having BECCS powered from waste products could remove up to 5 billion tonnes of CO2 from the air - that's a significant amount, but it would be a massive logistical challenge, requiring the collection and delivery of all economically available agricultural, forestry and municipal waste. ""If you have dedicated bioenergy crops that displace other land uses, such as forests or farms, the production of food and fibre would be reduced and you could increase the prices of commodities and really drive losses in biodiversity and ecosystem services,"" said Kelly Levin from WRI. ""BECCS needs to be done in a very careful way."" The study also considers direct air capture of CO2 and carbon mineralisation. Direct air capture involves the use of machines equipped with chemicals that can soak up carbon. To date, a few start-up projects, such as Climeworks in Switzerland and Carbon Engineering in Canada, have demonstrated that this can be done, although the costs are still high. Carbon mineralisation involves the exposure of rocks including basalt that react with carbon dioxide which becomes trapped, turning to mineral in the pores of the stone. This hasbeen done successfully,externalin Iceland, although the technique is still expensive. ""These could be major new weapons,"" said Prof Pacala. ""There is a substantial chance that less than $100 a tonne for direct air capture could be developed within 10 years. There's a high probability of that; no guarantee but a high probability."" The report says that current technologies that cost less than $100 per tonne can be scaled up safely and store large amounts of carbon but much less than is needed to avoid dangerous climate change. To meet the Paris climate agreement - to global temperature rise below 2C - about 20 billion tonnes of CO2 would need to be removed from the atmosphere every year by 2100. The technologies assessed in the report would remove ""significantly less than 10 billion tonnes of CO2"". The report acknowledges that there is a significant ""moral hazard"" here. ""If you present the siren song of negative emissions, does it decrease humanity's will to invest in the mitigation that's needed to reduce emissions - this a concern we've discussed in every meeting,"" said Prof Pacala. ""We are an academy committee and our job is to put before the public all the options that would be available - and I guarantee that the broader the portfolio of tools that we can bring to bear, the easier the job is going to be and the smaller the temperature increase that humanity is going to endure. ""Our job is to bring the opportunity to the public with full understanding that this moral hazard exists.""

"Scientists say we have to make ""rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes"" to our lifestyles, in order to avoid severely damaging climate change. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has just issued a report detailing theimpact of global warming at 1.5C above pre-industrial levels,external. Across the world we're on course for global warming at double this temperature if we don't change the way we live. We asked you to put your questions to us relating to thisrecent warning of climate change catastrophe. Here's a selection of them. Lucie asks: how much of an impact can we as individuals really make? It can seem - and indeed is - quite daunting to think about what contribution we can make as individuals to such a global problem. But the scientists contributing to this report have stressed that our choices really matter. Two key decisions we make every day are about what we eat and how we travel. Cutting down on red meat can reduce the carbon footprint of our diet significantly. And while every km in a car equals about 130g of carbon, a km on a bike doesn't produce any - apart from what the rider breathes out. Jaqueline Partington asks: what can I do immediately? I live in a rural area and I need my car. I'm in a similar situation - my only local bus service to the city was actually cancelled last year because no one was using it. A key thing you can do - especially if you're in a rural area and have the resources - is to think about generating your own energy. But even cheaper and easier is to adjust your diet. Meat and dairy, according to a huge global analysis published earlier this year, take up more than 80% of global farmland and their production emits significantly more greenhouse gas than cereals and vegetables. Frank Page asks: will anything we do matter if the US and China don't cut back on coal? You're right -  the bigger picture here is about global action. For countries to be seen as acting in a responsible way as organisations like the IPCC advise them, what needs to happen is for growing economies like China to be involved in climate change-averting action, if they want to be seen as key players on the world stage. The solar power industry in China, for example, is growing quickly. The International Energy Agency projects thatthe country will hold 40% of the world's solar power capacity in 2023,external.

David asks: Will the average family have to give up foreign holidays, with flying now discouraged in favour of other forms of transport? Certainly, if you stop taking flights - especially long-haul flights - you will reduce your carbon footprint. And there are other ways (if you have the time and the money to spend, that is) to get to some closer destinations. But of course, where and whether you take an annual holiday is entirely your choice. In the past, economists and scientists have proposed a carbon tax on flights - a tax based on the carbon emissions of a journey. This could be a way in which governments try to influence people's choices. Nikki Webb asks: why isn't the government making it mandatory for new homes to be built environmentally? Building in an environmentally friendly way is a complicated issue. The production of cement for concrete, for example, is very carbon-intensive. But if homes built with concrete are highly insulated and have a very long life-span, that could balance out. Certainly, with a housing shortage in the UK, lower-impact building techniques are certain to gain ground. And renewable energy will need to be a major part of a lower carbon future. The IPCC report said that renewables will need to produce 85% of our energy supply globally by 2050, and currently they provide about 25%. Luis Aramburu asks: why is nuclear not mentioned in the BBC article? Actually, nuclear, along with the rest of the energy sector, is covered in the IPCC's report. It is a detailed projection of the different future scenarios for our planet and - in reporting it - we didn't focus on nuclear, simply because there were so many other key points to discuss. You can see how the scientists incorporated that into their work inthe policy maker's summary of the IPCC report,external.

"L-R: Harry Styles, Ed Sheeran, Dua Lipa, Ed Sheeran, Harry Styles and Dua Lipa are among the artists who helped propel British music to a record year in 2017, according to a new report. Export revenues grew by 7% to a new high of Â£2.6bn, UK Music's Measuring Music report said. The biggest selling album of the year was Sheeran's Ã· (Divide), with singles including Shape of You and Perfect. UK record sales also saw a surge, netting Â£700m over the year - up 9% on 2016. For the second year in a row the number of successful records by British artists bucked the trend for annually declining music sales - which had slumped to Â£610m in 2015. Sam Smith's The Thrill of it All was 2017's fifth best-selling album globally Sheeran accompanied fellow Brits Rag'n'Bone Man, Sam Smith and Styles in the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry's (IFPI) global top 10 for 2017. Dua Lipa added to the success after becoming Spotify'smost-streamed female artist of 2017- beating the likes of Beyonce and Taylor Swift. Festivals and live events including world tours by Coldplay, The Rolling Stones and Sir Paul McCartney also accounted for Â£1bn of revenue - with the report confirming the O2 in London was the world's most popular arena. Last year saw five of the top 10 most successful worldwide tours come from the UK - with Depeche Mode and Sheeran alongside the aforementioned acts. Overall, the UK music industry contributed a record Â£4.5bn to the UK economy last year - up Â£100m on 2016. The report said more people were employed in the music industry than ever before, with almost 146,000 jobs. But UK Music's chief executive Michael Dugher issued a warning about the need to nurture the music industry's talent pipeline and to give people from a variety of backgrounds access to a career in the industry. ""These figures show what can be achieved when we choose to back the British music industry,"" Dugher said. ""That's why we need further government support to help us ensure we produce the next generation of world-leading British talent by backing music in education, protecting grassroots music venues and making sure that creators are properly rewarded for their work.

"This video can not be played How has the death of Jamal Khashoggi impacted the war in Yemen? Turkey has given its first official statement on how it believes Saudi writer Jamal Khashoggi was killed, saying he was immediately strangled. The statement follows weeks of media reports about the murder at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 2 October. Turkey has yet to provide evidence. Chief prosecutor Irfan Fidan said meetings with his Saudi counterpart this week led to ""no concrete results"". Saudi Arabia has not commented on the meetings. The Turkish statement said: ""In accordance with plans made in advance, the victim, Jamal Khashoggi, was choked to death immediately after entering the Consulate General of Saudi Arabia."" His body was then dismembered and destroyed ""again, in line with advance plans"", it added. The Jamal Khashoggi story so far Who is the journalist that disappeared? Jamal Khashoggi in his own words Khashoggi, a Saudi national working for the US press, was a well-known critic of his home country's rulers. His body has not been found, but Turkey, the US and Saudi Arabia have all agreed that he was killed at the consulate. There is still no consensus on how he died. Turkey said it had put three main questions to the Saudis during the prosecutor's visit: Where is Khashoggi's body? Do they have any new information about the planning of the killing? Who was the ""local co-operator ""? An unnamed Saudi official previously told Reuters news agency that Khashoggi's body had been rolled in a rug and given to a ""local co-operator"", who disposed of it. On Wednesday, the delegation responded the questions in writing, according to Turkey. Saudi Arabia said the answers could only come from a joint investigation. It also noted that it had never given an official statement on the existence of a ""co-operator"". Turkey has steered away from publicly blaming Saudi Arabia for the killing. However, a senior spokesperson from the ruling AK Party said on Wednesday that it could not have been carried out without orders from someone in a senior position. Saudi Arabia denies its royal family was involved. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke to Saudi King Salman last week, and the two agreed to continue co-operating in the investigation. Unnamed Turkish officials have previously told media outlets that they had audio and visual evidence to prove their accounts of the writer's death, but nothing has been released. This video can not be played Jamal Khashoggi's fiancee: ""We didn't say any goodbyes"" Turkish media have published details on how sources say Khashoggi was killed, including allegations he was tortured. His Turkish fiancÃ©e, Hatice Cengiz, gave a tearful interview to local television last week, saying she would never have let her partner enter the consulate if she had thought that the ""Saudi Arabia authorities would hatch a plot"" to kill him. He had entered the consulate to sort out documents for their marriage. Attorney General Sheikh Saud al-Mojeb met Mr Fidan twice, visited the consulate and spoke with Turkey's intelligence agency during his visit to Istanbul this week. He flew back to Saudi Arabia on Wednesday without making an official statement. Saudi Arabia has changed its account of what happened to Khashoggi. When he first disappeared, it said Khashoggi had walked out of the building alive. It later admitted he had been murdered, saying the killing was premeditated and a result of a ""rogue operation"". This video can not be played Jamal Khashoggi: What we know about the journalist's disappearance and death Saudi Arabia has subsequently said that Khashoggi was murdered, and that it is ""determined to find out all the facts"". It has arrested 18 suspects, who, it says, will be prosecuted in Saudi Arabia. Turkey wants the suspects to be extradited. Saudi Arabia has faced backlash over the death, including from its allies, who have called for answers. President Donald Trump has said he is ""not satisfied"" with the Saudi account. However, he also said he was unwilling to sacrifice lucrative arms deals with the country. This video can not be played Why do Trump's Saudi job numbers keep growing? Meanwhile, US activists have launched a petition, calling for a section of road near the Saudi embassy in Washington to be renamed Jamal Khashoggi Way. On Wednesday, France's foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said Khashoggi's death was a ""crime"" and ""odious"". He said France was not ""dependent on our economic relations with Saudi Arabia"" and the country would impose sanctions, but no details were given. UK Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt also said it was an appalling act, adding thatit had ""possibly"" given the US and the UK a chance to put new pressure on Saudi Arabiaover other issues. Earlier in the day,the US called for a swift cessation of hostilities in Yemen, where a Saudi-led coalition has been fighting local Houthi rebels. Khashoggi's fiancee on writer's death.

"The US has hit back against a UK plan to impose a new tax on sales by technology giants. US political leaders and business groups say the proposal would violate tax agreements by targeting US firms. They warned the tax could spark US retaliation and hurt prospects for a US-UK trade deal. In a statement on Wednesday, Representative Kevin Brady, a Republican from Texas, called the measure ""troubling"". ""If the United Kingdom or other countries proceed, that will prompt a review of our US tax and regulatory approach to determine what actions are appropriate to ensure a level playing field in global markets,"" said Mr Brady, who helped shepherd US tax cuts through Congress last year. His statement echoedcomments last week by US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin,external, who voiced ""strong concern"" about different countries' efforts to develop digital sales tax. A slew of business groups - including the US Chamber of Commerce and the US Council for International Business - have also come out against the UK plan. EU pushes for new tax on tech giants 'by Christmas' Budget 2018: Who will pay the Digital Services Tax? If enacted, the tax measure could ""complicate the United Kingdom's push for deeper US-UK trade relations"", said Rufus Yerxa, president of the National Foreign Trade Council. Kevin Brady shepherded the US tax cut through Congress last year The UK plan, announced as part of the Budget,would place a 2% tax on sales by large social media platforms, internet marketplaces and search engines from April 2020. In response to Mr Brady's comments, a UK Treasury spokesman said: ""As the chancellor said, this tax is a proportionate and targeted interim response that reflects the changing global economy, and how digital businesses derive value from users - it's not targeted at any country and seeks to ensure the tax system is fair."" It comes as wider efforts to capture more tax from multinational tech giants - which are now typically taxed based on their physical presence in a country - gain steam. The European Commission in March introduced a proposal for a 3% tax on revenues of internet companies with global revenues above â¬750m (Â£660m) a year. Whilesome EU member states are opposed,external, a vote could come before the end of the year. Separately, Spain introduced a digital service measure in its budget that mimics the EU's. Elsewhere, Colombia, Australia and India are among several countries debating new tax measures that target the digital giants, according tothe Internet Association,external, a US trade association with members that include Amazon, Microsoft and Uber. The 36-member OECD has also been discussing the issue, with a report on reforms due in 2020. The slew of measures, after years of discussion, explains the alarm in the US, said Lilian Faulhaber, a law professor at Washington's Georgetown University. ""There's a sense in the United States that this digital services tax is becoming more of a real possibility,"" she said. Under President Donald Trump, the US has been supportive of OECD efforts to update the corporate tax system for the global era, said Itai Grinberg, another law professor at Georgetown University. But many in the US - not just the internet giants - have concerns about proposals, like the UK's, that tax turnover, he added. ""It's a kind of tax that everyone abandoned half a century ago because it's thought of as very economically inefficient and functions basically like a tariff,"" he said. He said such taxes do little to make the international tax system more fair: ""It's just a pure cash grab"". The UK's chancellor: Searching online for revenues In announcing the UK tax, UK Chancellor Philip Hammond said progress in global arenas to update tax laws had been ""painfully slow"". But the move has irked some in the US. Josh Kallmer, executive vice president of policy at the Information Technology Industry Council, said the tech industry recognises the need for tax laws to change, but opposes revenue taxes and wants to see the OECD process play out. ""The responses that the UK and EU are poised to take are not helpful,"" he said. ""This is a genuinely global challenge.... Countries have got to coordinate and develop shared principles."" Professor Grinberg said the UK's decision to go it alone gives license to other countries to follow suit, undermining efforts to reach an international solution. The move is particularly risky for the UK, he added, because the logic for taxing tech firms could be extended other industries important to the UK, especially financial services and pharmaceuticals. ""I think it will go badly for the UK,"" he said. Should tech companies be paying more tax? Corbyn: Tech firm tax could fund journalism The US has a range of options should it want to retaliate, in addition to simply making the issue a focus in US-UK trade talks, he added. The US could complain to the WTO. Under US law, the president could also act to raise taxes on UK firms as a retaliatory measure. Professor Faulhaber described the responses being floated as ""nuclear options"". ""I don't know how likely they are but I do think they're pretty dramatic,"" she said. ""They... suggest that at least some people in the US see these proposals as fairly dramatic.""

"Sick leave and pay should be more flexible, so people with poor mental health can avoid severe financial hardship, a charity has said. The Money and Mental Health Policy Institute said preventative, part-time sick leave would help those facing mental health difficulties. Greater access to insurance products could protect the income of those with pre-existing conditions, it added. Its report suggested mental health cost UK employers up to Â£42bn a year. Poor mental health at work 'widespread' Budget 2018: Wages, mental health support and universal credit The research found that 2.3 million people in the UK were experiencing mental health problems that affected the amount of paid work they could do. One of those was Sarah James, 58, who said she had had to take time off on three occasions, owing to periods of serious ill-health. Stress left her in a manic state, and she said she had emerged with ""massive amounts of debt"" - on one occasion totalling Â£16,000. This had left her struggling to afford food and pay bills. She said it had been ""a challenge to get back to work"", but her continuous service in local authority employment had allowed her to build up a sick-pay safety net, which had helped. This video can not be played Sickness and wages: Do I get paid if I am off work? The institute said that tweaks to the benefits system, more flexible sick pay and phased returns to work would all help workers who found themselves in a similar situation as Mrs James. Helen Undy, director of the institute, said: ""For thousands of people in the UK, sick days are a luxury they just can't afford. Many with mental health problems are finding themselves too ill to work and too broke not to - choosing between causing harm to their mental health by working, or harm to their finances by taking time to recover. ""It's a vicious cycle, ultimately forcing many out of the workplace entirely. We want to see the government and employers taking urgent steps to improve sick pay, access to benefits and other income protection, so that a mental health diagnosis is not the first step out of the workforce."" The institute's report suggested sickness absence from the workplace due to mental health problems cost Â£8bn, with a further Â£1bn lost to the self-employed. Mental health problems could lead to longer periods of sickness absence. A survey of people who had taken time off work owing to a mental health problem found that 76% of them had taken more than a month off at least once. Some 300,000 people with a long-term mental health condition lost their job each year, it added. A survey of 44,000 people carried out by the mental health charity Mind found that only half of those who had experienced problems with stress, anxiety or low mood hadtalked to their employerabout it. Arecent poll by the Institute of Directorsfound fewer than one in five firms offered mental health training for managers. Poor relationships with line managers, along with workload, have the biggest negative impact on employees' mental health, the survey found - closely followed by poor relationships with colleagues.

"Chris Porsz spent up to 12 hours a day in various towns and cities, including here in Belfast An amateur photographer has spent eight years capturing ""quirky"" pictures of life on the UK's streets. Chris Porsz, 65, a paramedic from Peterborough, said he walked hundreds of miles in about 25 towns and cities looking for ""colourful characters"". The images have been compiled in a book called Streets of Britain. Mr Porsz said: ""I want to bring a smile to people's faces in this sad old world and the photos show people getting on, of all backgrounds, shapes and sizes."" He added: ""I'm always on the look-out for something amusing, surreal moments, quirky and colourful characters who stand out from the crowd.""

"Anthropologie has apologised after artist Tara Burke highlighted on Instagram that her work (right) had been copied US fashion and homewares giant Anthropologie has apologised after it sold goods that imitated an artist's designs without permission. Tara Burke, a ceramicist based in Sydney, Australia, called the retailer ""scum"" in a viral post on Instagram on Monday. She said Anthropologie asked to collaborate with her in 2016, but she had turned down the offer. Anthropologie says it has withdrawn the products in question. ""The welfare of our artist community is a priority for Anthropologie. We take intellectual property very seriously, both in protecting what has been developed by our own artists and designers and also respecting the intellectual property and designs of others, and we have systems in place for protecting creators' rights,"" the retailer said in a statement. ""We deeply regret that in this instance, our safeguards did not hold up to our standards. We have tremendous respect for the artist community and are exploring how we can further strengthen our protocols. The product in question is no longer available and we are reaching out directly to Tara Burke."" Ms Burke said she had since been contacted by the company, which offered a telephone call to discuss her concerns. There was no mention of compensation. She told the BBC that she was first contacted by Anthropologie in 2016 and asked if she would be interested in collaborating with the store. A company representative then visited her and photographed some of her work. As a result of this meeting, she says she was asked if she'd like to design some vases which the company would reproduce and sell in its stores, after paying her a fee. Ms Burke turned down the offer and thought that was the end of the matter. An Anthropologie vase (left) and Tara Burke's vase (right) Two years later, a friend alerted her to vases for sale on the Anthropologie website that she believed looked almost identical to her pieces. Ms Burke says she sent a letter of inquiry and an email to the company's legal team in the US in August, but never received a response. ""I guess because I hadn't commenced legal proceedings, they didn't feel the need to respond,"" she said. ""It's kind of a David-and-Goliath scenario."" Anthropologie's parent company, Urban Outfitters, has also been involved in a copyright dispute. In May,the High Street chain withdrew a range of vasesafter Bristol-based ceramicist Sarah Wilton complained the company had imitated pieces that she had designed for Liberty. At the time, Urban Outfitters said it withdrew the products ""out of deference to the artist"". Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

Ms Wilton said small, independent designers were often made to feel powerless when they came up against big companies. ""It's important to know your rights and let them know you know, so you that you can begin to negotiate,"" she said. ""Worst-case scenario is they'll ignore you. If that's the case, try and get some people power behind you."" Hundreds of Ms Burke's 18,000 Instagram followers commented on her post, many tagging Anthropologie's own Instagram account, to express their anger to the company directly. That seems to have triggered a response from the company - months after Ms Burke apparently first complained. Earrings made by jeweller Laurel Hill (left) and imported earrings later sold by Anthropologie (right) It's an all too familiar tale for American jewellery designer Laurel Hill. Anthropologie bought a range of earrings from her in 2014. When the company offered to reorder from her, Ms Hill says she decided the price was too low and declined. Then, she claims, she saw Anthropologie advertising earrings that looked to her identical to some she'd designed years earlier - but this time they were made overseas. She says the company ignored emails from her over many weeks. When she finally posted about it on Instagram, she says the earrings were removed from the Anthropologie site, but she never heard from the company again. Anthropologie says it didn't have any role in the design or the production of the earrings, which it says were purchased from an independent, domestic market vendor. The company says it suspended sales of the line in December 2017 as soon as Ms Hill's concerns were brought to its attention, and the market vendor made contact with her directly to resolve the issue.

"Questions have been raised about a recent report on warming in the ocean Errors have been found in a recent study suggesting the oceans were soaking up more heat than previously estimated. The initial report suggested that theseas have absorbed 60% more than previously thought,external. But a re-examination by a mathematician showed that the margin of error was larger than in the published study. The authors have acknowledged the problem and have submitted a correction to the journal. What is climate change? Final call to halt 'climate catastrophe' Risk of 'Hothouse Earth' despite CO2 cuts This video can not be played No more beef? Five things you can do to help stop rising global temperatures According to thelast major assessment,externalby the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the world's oceans have taken up more than 90% of the excess heat trapped by greenhouse gases. But the new study claimed that every year, for the past 25 years, we have put about 150 times the amount of energy used to generate electricity globally into the seas - 60% more than previous estimates. The authors suggested that this had huge implications for the way that the world is warming. If far more heat than previously believed was going into oceans, it also meant that far more heat than we thought has been generated by the warming gases we have emitted in the world to date. Therefore more heat from the same amount of gas means the Earth is more sensitive to CO2. Since 2007, scientists have been able to rely on a system of almost4,000 Argo floats,externalthat record temperature and salinity in the oceans around the world. But prior to this, the methods used to measure the heat in the ocean had many flaws and uncertainties. The team involved in the study used a new approach to measuring the amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the air. They believed that this allowed them to accurately measure ocean temperatures globally, dating back to 1991, when data from a global network of stations became available. The key element in this methodology is the fact that, as waters get warmer, they release more carbon dioxide and oxygen into the air. ""When the ocean warms, the amount of these gases that the ocean is able to hold goes down,"" said lead author Dr Laure Resplandy from Princeton University. ""So what we measured was the amount lost by the oceans, and then we can calculate how much warming we need to explain that change in gases."" They were discovered by a mathematician,Nicholas Lewis,external, who has long been critical of climate models, arguing that they are over-sensitive to emissions of carbon dioxide. He reviewed the paper when it was published and found what he termed ""serious (but surely inadvertent) errors in the underlying calculations."" The key element deals with the amount of uncertainty in the measurements. As a result of the increased margin of error, the findings on the amount of heat being absorbed by the oceans can't be definitively supported. They've put their hands up and acknowledged the error. Ralph Keeling, who co-authored the study said in a statement that he takes responsibility for the ""oversights"" and would like to ""thank Nicholas Lewis for bringing an apparent anomaly in the trend calculation to our attention."" ""These problems do not invalidate the methodology or the new insights into ocean biogeochemistry on which it is based, but they do influence the mean rate of warming we infer, and more importantly, the uncertainties of that calculation."" The authors say they have now reworked their calculations and submitted a correction to the journal, Nature, which originally published the study. This video can not be played Climate change: How 1.5C could change the world They have issued an editor's note about the issue. ""We would like to alert readers that the authors have informed us of errors in the paper. An implication of the errors is that the uncertainties in ocean heat content are substantially underestimated. We are working with the authors to establish the quantitative impact of the errors on the published results, at which point in time we will provide a further update."" According to the scientists involved in the original study, the ocean is still probably warming more than the estimate used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. But the errors mean that it has a larger range of probability - between 10% and 70%. This is in line with other studies. ""Our error margins are too big now to really weigh in on the precise amount of warming that's going on in the ocean,"" Ralph Keeling said. ""We really muffed the error margins.""
