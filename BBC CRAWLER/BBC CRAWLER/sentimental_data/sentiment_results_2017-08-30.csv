"This video can not be played The prime minister made her comments in Kyoto on the first day of a three-day visit to Japan Theresa May has said she wants to lead the Conservatives into the next general election, telling the BBC she intends to remain in power ""for the long term"". Speaking in Japan, the PM said her job was not just to deliver Brexit but to define the UK's place in the world and also to tackle domestic ""injustices"". Some reports had suggested she could stand down in 2019 after EU withdrawal. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson gave Mrs May his ""undivided backing"", but Labour accused her of being delusional. The prime minister has been under pressure after losing her Commons majority in a snap election called earlier this year. Mr Johnson, speaking on a visit to Nigeria, said she could ""certainly"" win an absolute majority at the next general election. But shadow Cabinet Office minister Jon Trickett said the prime minister was ""deluding herself"" about her plan to stay in power until the next election. ""Neither the public nor Tory MPs believe her fantasy of staying on till 2022,"" he said. ""Theresa May leads a zombie government."" The next general election is not scheduled to take place until May 2022, by which point Mrs May - if she stayed in Downing Street - would have been PM for nearly six years. In the immediate aftermath of her party's failure to win June's general election outright, several MPs called on her to consider her position. Former Chancellor George Osborne, who has become a newspaper editor after being sacked by Mrs May, said she was a ""dead woman walking"". The PM has sought to consolidate her position by negotiating a governing agreement with the Democratic Unionists and overhauling the way Downing Street works, replacing key advisers. But this has not stopped speculation about how long she might remain in No 10 and about potential successors, although one cabinet minister earlier this summer blamed such talk on too much ""warm prosecco"". Asked whether she wanted to lead her party into another general election, whenever that takes place, the prime minister told the BBC's Ben Wright in Kyoto that that was her intention. ""Yes, I'm here for the long term. What me and my government are about is not just delivering on Brexit but delivering a brighter future for the UK. She said she wanted to ensure ""global Britain"" could take its trading place in the world, as well as dealing with ""those injustices domestically that we need to do to ensure that strong, more global, but also fairer Britain for the future"" Reality Check: Japan's position on UK trade deal Brexit progress 'slow' says Verhofstadt The prime minister says she has a lengthy agenda and is not just focused on Brexit The prime minister faces a crucial few months with a number of tests of her authority within the party, including her second conference speech as party leader in October and key Brexit votes in the Commons. Newspapers reports over the weekend claimed Mrs May had told MPs that she intended to stand down in the summer of 2019 to give her successor ample time to bed in before the next election. No 10 dismissed the reports as ""peak silly season"". Mr Johnson, who received public backing from Mrs May after recent criticism of his performance, said: ""I've made it clear I'm giving my undivided backing to Theresa May. ""We need to get Brexit done. ""She's ideally placed to deliver a great outcome for our country and then deliver what we all want to see, which is this exciting agenda of global Britain. ""I think she gets it.  She really wants to deliver it.  I'm here to support her."" The UK is due to leave the EU in March 2019 and supporters of Mrs May have said leadership speculation only serves to undermine attempts to secure the best possible terms of exit. On the second day of her trip to Japan, Mrs May will hold official talks with her counterpart Shinzo Abe and emphasise the growing security links between the two countries.

"The US has approved the first treatment to redesign a patient's own immune system so it attacks cancer. The regulator - the US Food and Drug Administration - said its decision was a ""historic"" moment and medicine was now ""entering a new frontier"". The company Novartis is charging $475,000 (Â£367,000) for the ""living drug"" therapy, which leaves 83% of people free of a type of blood cancer. Doctors in the UK said the announcement was an exciting step forward. The living drug is tailor-made to each patient, unlike conventional therapies such as surgery or chemotherapy. It is called CAR-T and is made by extracting white blood cells from the patient's blood. The cells are then genetically reprogrammed to seek out and kill cancer. The cancer-killers are then put back inside the patient and once they find their target they multiply. Dr Scott Gottlieb, from the FDA, said: ""We're entering a new frontier in medical innovation with the ability to reprogram a patient's own cells to attack a deadly cancer. ""New technologies such as gene and cell therapies hold out the potential to transform medicine and create an inflection point in our ability to treat and even cure many intractable illnesses."" The therapy, which will be marketed as Kymriah, works against acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Most patients respond to normal therapy and Kymriah has been approved for when those treatments fail. Dr Stephan Grupp, who treated the first child with CAR-T at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, said the new approach was ""enormously exciting"". ""We've never seen anything like this before,"" he added. That first patient had been near to death, but has now been cancer-free for more than five years. Out of 63 patients treated with CAR-T therapy, 83% were in complete remission within three months and long-term data is still being collected. However, the therapy is not without risks. It can cause potentially life-threatening cytokine release syndrome from the rapid proliferation of the CAR-T cells in the body. This can be controlled with drugs. But the potential of CAR-T technology goes beyond one type of cancer. Dr David Maloney, medical director of cellular immunotherapy at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, said the FDA's decision was a ""milestone"". He added: ""We believe this is just the first of what will soon be many new immunotherapy-based treatments for a variety of cancers. CAR-T technology has shown most promise against different blood-based cancers. However, it has struggled against ""solid tumours"" such as lung cancer or melanoma. Dr Prakash Satwani, a paediatric oncologist at Columbia University Medical, said: ""The results haven't been that great when you compare it with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, but I'm sure the technology will get better in the near future."" Boosting the immune system is already a cornerstone of modern cancer treatment. A range of drugs that ""take the brakes off"" the immune system to allow it to attack cancer more freely have already been adopted around the world. CAR-T technology, which goes a step further and redesigns the immune system, is at a much earlier stage. Prof Peter Johnson, the chief clinician at the charity Cancer Research UK, said: ""The first genetically modified cell therapy to be approved by the FDA is an exciting step forward. ""We still have a lot to learn about how to use it safely and who might benefit from it, so it is important to recognise this is just a first step."" Follow Jameson Twitter,external.

"Zoiey Smale was named Miss United Continents UK 2017 in June but has now handed back her crown The winner of a beauty pageant says she has handed back her crown after being told she was ""too big"" and needed to go on a diet. Zoiey Smale, a size 10, was due to represent the UK at Miss United Continents 2017 in Ecuador after winning nationally in Nottingham. She said she considered going anyway in protest but decided to speak out. The BBC has contacted the international competition organisers, who she says sent the dieting feedback, for comment. ""I think it's important to empower women and know it's OK to be healthy, educated and a good role model,"" said Ms Smale, from Northamptonshire. ""I didn't hand my crown over straight away. I was going to go out of protest, however what example would that be setting?"" Zoiey Smale said her size 10 figure is ""healthy"" rather than ""ridiculously thin"" The 28-year-old, who has been entering beauty pageants for a decade, beat 11 other finalists to win the title of Miss United Continents UK 2017 in June. She was due to travel to Ecuador for the international competition on 23 September. Ms Smale said the national director had some feedback from the international director of the competition, and tried to ""tactfully"" pass this on. ""I asked her to just tell me exactly what was said,"" Ms Smale said. ""[I was told] 'she needs to go on a diet plan as she is too big'. ""At this point I was so shocked and needed a moment to compose myself."" Zoiey spoke out about the pageant on social media Ms Smale said she has received a lot of support since writing about her decision on social media. ""I have received thousands of messages from women who have passed my message on to their daughters,"" she said.

"Theresa May's assertion that she's ""not a quitter"", and plans instead to lead the Conservatives into the next election, is the lead story for several of the newspapers. The Guardian,externalsays her pledge could ""reignite anger"" among Tory MPs, who have been led to believe she would stay on only until the end of the Brexit talks. The paper suggests Mrs May is trying to ""stamp her authority"" on the party ahead of a number of tough battles in Parliament this autumn. The Times,externalagrees that having survived the summer without a leadership challenge, an emboldened prime minister is starting to look beyond Brexit. According to the paper's political editor Francis Elliott,,externalMrs May is ""hanging tough"" - and she's not going without a fight. For the Daily Telegraph,,externalthe surprise announcement was a ""radical departure"" from her previous statements where she said she would only stay for as long as she was wanted. The paper points out the parallels with Margaret Thatcher, who vowed in 1987 to ""go on and on"", only to be ousted three years later. Her strategy of ""throwing down the gauntlet to her rivals"" could backfire, the paper says, and ""reignite plots to challenge her"". Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external The Financial Times,externalbelieves the prime minister's comments could prompt an early leadership election. The Daily Mail,externalreports that her announcement will ""shock Westminster"" and leave many of her backbenchers ""stunned"", but in an editorial, the paper says it's time for the party to rally behind her. The Daily Express agrees that a ""defiant"" prime minister, who's in it for the long haul, is ""precisely what this country needs"". Several papers use photos of Prince William and Prince Harry looking at tributes to their mother outside Kensington Palace - taken 20 years apart The other story dominating the newspapers is the 20th anniversary of the death of Princess Diana. On their front pages, boththe Sun,externalandthe Daily Mail,externaljuxtapose photographs of a young Prince William and Prince Harry outside the gates of Kensington Palace in 1997, with pictures of them standing in the same spot on Wednesday. For the Daily Mirror,,externaltheir impromptu visit to the Palace gates to look at the tributes to their mother had ""heart-rending echoes"" of 20 years ago. A quote from Prince Harry - ""all of us lost somebody that day"" - is the headline inthe Daily Telegraph.,external Kezia Dugdale resigned with her ""head held high"" The Times,externalreports on the fallout from the resignation of the Scottish Labour leader, Kezia Dugdale, claiming the ""Corbynistas are set for a power grab"" in the race to replace her. The Guardian,externalsays tensions with the party leadership in London ""helped"" her decision to quit. The i newspaper,externalsays claims she was hounded out by the hard left are exaggerated and the possibility of her standing down had been talked about for a while. ""Hard slog, negligible progress"" is howthe Financial Times,externalsums up the third round of Brexit talks between the UK and the EU this week. The paper says the two sides ""danced around the biggest obstacles"", making headway on only a handful of issues and deliberately holding back their strongest political cards for a showdown later this year. The Daily Telegraph,externalreports on the ""fury in Brussels"" where EU Brexit negotiators were apparently left ""flabbergasted"" after their British counterparts spent three hours rebutting the EU's demands for a divorce settlement. Looking ahead to what's expected to be a ""frosty"" joint news conference later, the paper says the talks are on course for an ""acrimonious impasse"". The Financial Times,externalreveals that the NHS is planning to pay recruitment agencies up to Â£100m to boost the number of GPs in England. The paper says around half of the 5,000 new doctors promised by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt will be recruited from overseas.

"A series of attacks in Europe over the summer months has raised the number of people killed in the West by jihadists during the past three years to more than 420, writes Dr Lorenzo Vidino. The deaths of 16 people in Barcelona and Cambrils earlier this month highlighted the continued threat posed by Islamist militants. The summer months have also seen new attacks inBelgium,France,Austria,external,Germanyandthe UK, as well as the first inFinlandand one inthe US. Although the vastmajority of Islamist attacks are elsewhere in the world, an unprecedented number have taken place in Europe and North America since thedeclaration of a ""caliphate"" by the so-called Islamic State, in June 2014. Thefirst look at the data behind the attacks,external- everything from the age of the perpetrators, to immigration status - offers an insight into those responsible and how they might be tackled. We identified 63 attacks between September 2014 and late August 2017 that we considered to be acts of jihadist terrorism. A relatively limited number of countries were affected: nine in Europe - those named above, plusDenmarkandSweden- along with the US and Canada. Flowers and a flag left near the Orlando nightclub where an Islamist gunman killed 49 people in June 2016 Regardless of country, most attacks were in large towns and cities - including Barcelona, London, Manchester, Paris, Nice, Berlin, Brussels, Stockholm and Orlando. A few attacks hit iconic targets, such as theChamps-Elyseesand theLouvre museumin Paris,Westminster in LondonandLas Ramblas in Barcelona. Many others targeted crowded spaces such as busy pedestrian areas, entertainment venues or transport hubs. But some terrorist attacks have hit more unusual places, including anoffice Christmas partyand aservice at a church. We looked at attacks motivated by jihadist ideology, that involved deliberate acts of violence against other people and were intended to intimidate or convey a message to a larger group. Other organisations use different definitions. Researchers used open-source material and interviews with officials It is possible that some attacks did not come to our attention, or that full details are not available The research covers the US, Canada and the 28 member states of the EU, plus Norway and Switzerland Attacks motivated by other ideologies - such asthe murder of Jo Cox- are not included in this study In total, the 63 attacks caused 424 deaths and left almost 1,800 people injured. The perpetrators are not included in these figures. TheParis attack of November 2015was the deadliest, with 130 people killed, including90 at the Bataclan theatre. France also saw theNice lorry attack, which left 86 people dead. 14 July 2016: A lorry ploughed into a crowd in the French Riviera town of Nice There were many other attacks that left many people dead and others injured. InOrlando, 49 people were killedin an attack on a gay nightclub Bombings atBrussels airport and at a metro stationleft 32 people dead 14 people were killed at aChristmas party in San Bernardino, California 12 people died when a lorry was driven into a crowdedChristmas market in Berlin 12 people died when the Paris offices ofCharlie Hebdowere attacked in January 2015 Five people were killed in theWestminster attackin April TheManchester Arena bombingin May led to 22 deaths TheLondon Bridge attackin June left eight people dead The attacks inBarcelona and Cambrilsleft 16 people dead In total, these 11 attacks were responsible for 386 deaths. However, most of the attacks did not cause casualties, with the exclusion of the perpetrators. Although thenumber of young people being radicalised has caused concern, the average age of the attackers - 27.5 - is not unusually young. The two youngest were 15 - an unnamed boywho attacked a Jewish teacher with a machetein Marseille, and Safia S,a girl who stabbed a police officerat a Hannover train station. Of the five who were under the age of 18 at the time, four were in Germany. The vast majority of the attackers were in their 20s, with about one in four attackers above the age of 30 and six aged 40 or older. The oldest suspect, Mohamed H Khalid, was 54 when he was accused of stabbing to death anelderly couple in the Austrian city of Linz,external. In the UK,Khalid Masood, was 52 when he drove into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge and stabbed to death a police officer at the Houses of Parliament. Despitewomen becoming increasingly active in jihadist networks, only two out of 85 individual perpetrators were female. Fewer than one in five perpetrators was a convert to Islam, with a significantly higher percentage in North America than in Europe. However, the converts were significantly more likely to have a criminal background and to have served time in prison. Overall, half of the attackers had a prior criminal background. How can police stop terror suspects travelling? Is terror more of a threat to Europe than before? Terror deaths in Western Europe at highest level since 2004 Can you monitor every suspect? The relationship between terrorism and migration is a complex one and has been at the centre of extremely polarising debates, particularly during theEuropean migrant crisis. However, the number of attackers who were illegally in a country or who arrived as refugees is small. Two-thirds were citizens of the country they attacked, with others either legal residents, or legal visitors from neighbouring countries. However, individuals who were in the West illegally also carried out deadly attacks. November 2015: Tributes left in Paris following attacks that left 130 people dead At least two of those involved in the November 2015 Paris attacks arethought to have posed as refugeesto enter Europe through Greece. Three other individuals were refugees or asylum seekers at the time of attack, while seven were in the country illegally or awaiting deportation. The latter group includes Uzbek nationalRakhmat Akilov, who killed four people with a hijacked lorry in Stockholm in April 2017, and Tunisian citizenAnis Amri, who also used a lorry to commit his attack at the Berlin Christmas market. Wreckage from an attack on a Berlin Christmas market, December 2016 There is also one case of ""terrorist tourism"", involving Egyptian citizenAbdullah Hamamy, who lived in the United Arab Emirates and attacked soldiers at the Louvre in February 2017. Two of the four most lethal attacks - those in Paris in November 2015 and in Brussels in 2016 - are believed to bewell orchestrated multiple attacks directed by IS,external. 22 March 2016: A security guard helps a wounded woman after the attack on the Brussels metro system They were also executed in part by former foreign fighters. However, the two other most deadly attacks - those in Orlando in June 2016 and in Nice in July 2016 - were carried out independently by individuals without operational connection to a jihadist group. These episodes demonstrate that terrorist sympathisers who never travelled to conflict areas and who act independently can be as dangerous as a team of highly trained militants. Overall, links between attackers and jihadist groups operating overseas are not always easy to determine. Of the attacks that have hit the West since June 2014, fewer than one in 10 was carried out under direct orders from the leadership of IS. In some cases it can be difficult to tell, for example IS said it was behind both the Las Ramblas and Cambrils attacks, but it did not provide any evidence. Nevertheless, the influence of IS can be clearly seen. During or before the attack, six out of 10 perpetrators pledged allegiance to a jihadist group, almost always IS - which frequently claims responsibility. Unsurprisingly, given the frequency of attacks and the number of deaths and injuries, jihadist terrorism has come to the fore of political debates in the West and receives widespread news coverage. The threat is not expected to wane in the near future, with policymakers, counter-terrorism officials and the public all being asked to take action. 22 March 2017: Westminster Bridge following a terror attack There are huge implications for domestic and foreign policy throughout Western countries. It is hoped that knowing more about the attacks and the people who carried them out will help us all have a more informed debate about what action is needed.

"Europe's leaders feared 2017: the onward march of populism, the stagnant economies, the resentment of voters and the spread of Euroscepticism. And then it didn't happen. Europe breathed again and even dared to believe that faith in the European project had been restored. Yet the story of 2017 is actually how little has changed. The great mobiliser for the European cause has been Donald Trump. Whatever their frustrations with Brussels, those who argue for deeper European integration see the rollercoaster of his presidency as strengthening their case, and some EU nations have sought to tighten the European embrace. The year's turning point was judged to be the election of Emmanuel Macron. He had campaigned for the French presidency on an openly pro-European ticket. He promised change: to reform the sclerotic French economy, to re-engineer the European project and to revive the Franco-German relationship. Now, in the dog days of summer, momentum has been lost. The honeymoon has passed. President Macron's popularity has slumped below 40%. After the first three months in office, Nicolas Sarkozy's approval rating was 67%. In France, a familiar script is unfolding. A new president plans to reform the ""code du travail"", the weighty labour code, making it easier to hire and fire workers. Some unions fear their collective bargaining rights are being undermined. Strikes and protests are planned. Even as Mr Macron prepares to unveil the details of his plans this week, he cannot hide his doubts. ""France,"" he says, ""isn't a reformable country. It's a country that hates reforms."" His party has a large parliamentary majority but, as in the past, the battle for France's future will play out on the streets. President Macron's poll ratings have slumped since his election in May President Macron's fortunes are a reminder that the anti-establishment mood has not abated; voters' loyalties have shallow roots and shift easily. Another test of European opinion arrives on 24 September, when Germany goes to the polls. The debate, so far, is muted. Little has changed from 2013, when the campaign was fought around Angela Merkel's safe pair of hands. She is again ahead in the polls, the candidate not of reform but stability. There is much to argue over, however; low wages; the failing infrastructure and the deceptions of parts of the auto industry. Some of the big German carmakers arefacing new allegations of collusionfollowing the diesel emissions scandal. Is France already losing its Macron frisson? How Angela Merkel is 'taking back control' - German style Migrant crisis: Italy approves Libya naval mission Brexit: What is at stake in EU-UK talks? Abroad, there is no inclination to exert German leadership beyond being the anchor of the EU. Crises are being managed rather than addressed. Mrs Merkel has insisted that accepting a million refugees, as happened in 2015, will never be repeated. The German chancellor is dependent on President Erdogan of Turkey keeping refugees off the front pages. If he doesn't approve of what Berlin is doing, his coastguard can turn a blind eye towards boats leaving Turkey for Greece. It is no coincidence that in the past week the numbers of migrants arriving in Greece has edged up again, with the recent souring of German-Turkish relations. A million migrants arrived in Germany in 2015 In Italy, there is utter weariness and anger at the failure of the rest of Europe to share the refugee burden. The Italian Interior Minister Marco Minniti says that unmanaged migration from Libya is ""threatening the social and democratic fabric of Italy"". So, Italy has been active in Libya, helping the Libyan coastguard prevent migrant boats leaving North Africa. There are reports of traffickers being paid off and of tribes in southern Libya being funded to turn back economic migrants heading north. In the past couple of months, the numbers arriving in Italy have fallen. Europe seems to be edging towards setting up refugee reception camps in Africa. Italy will be the next test case to determine whether populism in Europe has reached its high-water mark. It will hold elections in 2018, and Europe will be on the ballot. Since joining the euro, the Italian economy has stagnated. Despite recent flickers of improvement, it has the second lowest growth in the EU. The government in Rome wants Brussels to ease the rules on tax and spending. Waiting in the wings are a raft of anti-European parties, and Silvio Berlusconi could yet re-emerge as a politician of influence. New fault lines have emerged  between countries in Eastern and Central Europe and the rest of Europe. Poland and Hungary are chafing at directives from Brussels. Poland continues to ignore protests from the European Commission over plans to change its judiciary. Italian Interior Minister Marco Minniti says unmanaged migration from Libya threatens ""the social and democratic fabric of Italy"" Negotiations over Brexit continue but are marked by accusations. Brussels is urging the UK to start talking ""seriously"". The UK is calling on the EU to show greater ""flexibility"". It is possible that the EU will decide in October that sufficient progress has not been made on issues such as the UK's bill for leaving the EU so blocking a move to the next and crucial phase of Brexit -  deciding the future trading relationship between the UK and Europe. Some officials are speaking of the need for both sides to peer over the cliff edge, to feel the sweat of a breakdown, before there is real progress. In the UK, the Bank of England has downgraded growth forecasts for this year and next. Major international companies, such as BMW, IBM and Google, are continuing to invest in the UK but the Bank's governor, Mark Carney,has warned business investmenthas been slower than it would have been. The Germans say their exports to the UK are down by 3%. The business communities are urging putting ""shared economic interests first"". But that is not the priority for Europe's leaders. They want to safeguard European unity, and, whatever the economic benefits, they are adamant the UK must not end up better off than if it had stayed inside the EU. Brexit negotiations are still in their early days The eurozone economy has revived, but it has removed a sense of urgency in Europe. It grew 0.6% in the second quarter. Unemployment is falling, even in France. The popular mood in Europe is less Eurosceptic. The fear of other countries leaving the EU seems overstated. For some, President Trump threatens to erode the international liberal order, but that only encourages Europe to be bolder in looking after its own interests. But most of the factors that gave rise to Europe's anti-establishment parties have not disappeared: those left behind by globalisation, inequality, the insecurity of the middle class, the failure to manage migration and the terror attacks that since the start of 2015 have killed more than 300 people in Europe. Europe's leaders, especially President Macron, have spoken of reforming the EU by strengthening bailout funds, by bolstering the eurozone with a finance minister, by greater supervision of national tax and spending. But Europe's crisis grew out of a gap between what people wanted and what governments and European institutions were delivering. That gap isn't narrowing. Europe is still struggling to manage the range of crises it is facing.  What hasn't emerged is a vision to drive the European project forward.

"Katrina Esau is working hard make sure that the language of her childhood outlives her Katrina Esau is working hard to save the language of her childhood from dying out. At 84, Ms Esau is one of the last three fluent speakers of N|uu, one of the languages spoken by South Africa's San community, also known as Bushmen. N|uu is considered the original language of southern Africa. With no other fluent speakers in the world apart from this family, the language is recognised by the UN as ""critically endangered"". ""When I was a child, I only spoke N|uu and I heard a lot of people speaking the language. Those were good times, we loved our language but that has changed,"" says Ms Esau in Upington, a town in the Northern Cape Province. For centuries, the San roamed this region freely, gathering plants and hunting animals to feed their families. But today the traditional practices of the San have all but died out and their descendants tell me that language is one of the only things left that connects them to their history. Inside a small wooden hut, she teaches the 112 sounds including 45 distinct clicks of N|uu with the local children. ""I'm teaching the language because I don't want it to become extinct when we die,"" Ms Esau says. ""I want to pass on as much of it as I can but I am very aware that we don't have a lot of time."" Ms Esau has been running the school in her home for about 10 years. This video can not be played Listen to 84-year-old Katrina Esau speaking N|uu The people in this community, including Ms Esau now mainly speak Afrikaans, which is related to the language spoken by the Dutch settlers who arrived in South Africa in the 17th Century. ""We would get beaten up by the white man if we were caught speaking our language,"" she tells me. ""Because of our history, people today do not want to speak the language any more, there is so much pain around it. ""We abandoned the N|uu language and learned to speak Afrikaans, although we are not white people - that has affected our identity,"" she adds. Ms Esau's two sisters Hanna Koper and Griet Seekoei - both over 90 - are listening intently as she speaks with bitter fondness of their childhood. They don't speak much but nod in agreement as she speaks. Ouma Geelmeid, as she is affectionately known, says she is hoping to remove the shame around speaking N|uu today. During lessons, with a stick in her hand, Ms Esau points out the N|uu names for body parts on the white board as the students read in chorus. Like many other African languages, this language had been passed down orally over generations - but this is now threatening its survival. Until recent years there was no record of it as a written language. The local Khoisan children speak mainly Afrikaans but Katrina Esau hopes this will change over time Ms Esau worked with linguists, Professors Sheena Shah from the School of Oriental and African Studies (Soas) in London and Matthias Brezinger of the Centre for African Language Diversity in Cape Town to create a N|uu alphabet and basic rules of grammar for teaching purposes. ""From the work we did with Ouma Geelmeid's community, we learned that these communities view language as an important marker of their identity."" says Ms Shah. Experts say personal identity is becoming increasingly important in a world that is embracing globalisation. Language is about more than simply an idea to communicate with one another, it is also tied in with culture and a way of life for a community, the experts tell me. ""When you look at the African languages, you learn that they help communicate different perspectives on life, relationships, spirituality, the earth, health, humanity,"" says Mr Brezinger. ""There is a wealth of knowledge on survival that has been passed down through the years in indigenous communities that the Western world knows very little about and when these languages die, that unique knowledge is also lost,"" he continues. Back in the classroom, there are about 20 children, most of them under 10 years old and a few teenagers. Mary-Ann Prins, 16, is Ms Esau's best student and hopes to one day teach this class. ""I love learning this language. It makes me feel like I belong, like I am connected to my great-grandparents. I'm told that they used to speak it and today I can be a part of that too,"" she says with a broad smile. N|uu is not the only language at risk of disappearing in South Africa. Three hours away, in the town of Springbok, Nama speakers have been lobbying the government to have their language made an official language. The Nama community want their language to be recognised as one of South Africa's official languages Despite being historically widely spoken in South Africa, Nama is not recognised as one of the country's 11 official languages. ""It's very sad that our children cannot speak Nama. It breaks my heart that our children will never be able to communicate with their elders in their own language,"" says Maria Damara, 95, one of the only Nama speakers here. ""What future will they have, what will happen to our culture?"" South Africa's top six mother-tongue languages: Zulu:22.7%, Xhosa:16%, Afrikaans:13.5%, English:9.6%, Setswana:8%, Sesotho:7.6% South Africa has 11 official languages altogether English is the most commonly spoken language used officially and in business Source: SA.info/Census 2011 Why SA students want to be taught in English Community leader Wiela Beker, 56, agrees: ""If you don't have language, you don't have nothing. I'm talking in English to you now but I am not English. I want to speak Nama because that's what and who I am. ""Unless we do something about it, our culture is going to die. We are fighting for our culture when we fight for our language,"" he says. But without a shift in language policy and government intervention, this community say they are worried that it won't be long until their language finds itself in the same boat as N|uu - on the verge of extinction. And so for these communities the fight is for a shared identity, a sense of belonging - and therefore a legacy for future generations.

"North Korea's official news agency distributed this photo, purportedly of the missile launch US President Donald Trump said ""we'll see"" when asked if he was going to attack North Korea after the secretive state claimed to have successfully tested a hydrogen bomb. So what could military action against Kim Jong-un's regime actually look like? Pyongyang has defied UN sanctions and international pressure to develop nuclear weapons and test missiles that could potentially reach the US. South Korea, Japan, China and Russia are among those to voice strong criticism against the country's nuclear tests. And when North Korea fired a missile over Japan's Hokkaido region, sending residents running for cover, President Trump said ""all options are on the table"". But while the US has unrivalled military strength, the range of options it actually has against the hermit country are limited. This is the least risky but arguably least effective option available since it would simply build on deployments that have long been in place and have had little success in deterring North Korea's ballistic missile and nuclear programme. The US could move additional ground forces into South Korea, including ground-based missile defences, such as thecontroversial Thaad system, heavy artillery and armoured vehicles, to demonstrate its willingness to use force to back up its demands. However, South Korea temporarilyhalted the current Thaad deploymentand is strongly against any increases in US ground forces, because of concerns about provoking the North. Indeed, North Korea would almost certainly interpret such moves as a prelude to a ground invasion, given its reactions toannual joint exercisesbetween the US and South Korean militaries. China and Russia would no doubt strenuously object too, and both have the power to make life difficult for the US in other areas such as Eastern Europe and the South and East China Seas. The US Navy could increase its presence around Korea, sending more cruisers and destroyers able to shoot down ballistic missiles and, possibly, deploying a second carrier strike group. Alongside the naval options, the US Air Force could bolster its forward-based airpower, with more attack fighter squadrons, support tankers, surveillance aircraft and heavy bombers at bases in Guam, South Korea and Japan. However, the US Navy and US Air Force are both extremely heavily tasked around the world and are feeling the strain of well over a decade of continuous high-intensity deployments in support of operations, including those in Iraq and Afghanistan. More importantly, perhaps, time is on North Korea's side, since an enhanced US military presence would not itself force a halt to its rapidly maturing nuclear weapons programme and ballistic missile testing. And any statement of intent to shoot down North Korean ballistic missiles that travel outside the country's airspace would itself require a major increase in US Navy presence around the peninsula. North Korea has a large ballistic missile arsenal, and US interceptor missiles are extremely expensive and available in limited quantities aboard each ship. It would, therefore, be possible for the North to overwhelm and deplete the US Navy's stocks, leaving them vulnerable and forced to return to port. Such a policy would therefore represent an extremely expensive and probably unsustainable challenge to North Korea, as well as a dangerous escalation towards direct military conflict. Can the world live with a nuclear North Korea? What does provocative test show? What can the outside world do? Three minutes to shelter from a missile The North Korea crisis in 300 words The US Air Force and US Navy possess the most advanced surgical strike capabilities on Earth. Using volleys of precision Tomahawk missiles fired from submarines off the North Korean coastline and attacks by B-2 stealth bombers against key North Korean nuclear sites and ballistic missile facilities may seem like an attractive proposition, at first glance. It is undoubtedly the case that heavy damage could be inflicted on high-value targets, with deeply buried and hardened underground facilities vulnerable to the 30,000lb Massive Ordnance Penetrator bomb. The immediate danger to US aircraft would depend on many factors, including the amount of warning North Korea received, the number of strikes flown and the contribution of non-stealth aircraft within range of its defences. However, the state of North Korea's air defence network is very hard to determine since it is a mix of Soviet/Russian, Chinese and home-grown surface-to-air missile and radar systems acquired over 50 years. The defences are among the densest on Earth, but they have been modified and upgraded to an unknown degree and their readiness is difficult to assess. If the US lost aircraft to enemy fire or accidents, it would then face the nightmare scenario of having to try to rescue its aircrew, or abandon them to a very public fate. A missile launch across a Japanese island caused big concern in August Far more significant, however, is the fact that even successful strikes on nuclear and missile sites, command centres and even the leadership itself, would not stop North Korea retaliating. The People's Army would still have the ability to inflict almost inevitably devastating damage in immediate retaliation against South Korea - a key US ally. It consists of more than a million regular soldiers and, by some estimates, more than six million reserves and paramilitary troops. A huge number of conventional and rocket artillery pieces, mostly dug in near the demilitarised zone, include hundreds that are within range of parts of the South Korean capital city Seoul, which is home to around 10 million people. Even the US military would take days to fully eliminate just these artillery batteries, which would be able to fire tens of thousands of shells and rockets during that time. The catastrophic damage that these batteries would inflict on a crowded modern city, as well as the South Korean military forces, is why the South Korean government is opposed to any pre-emptive military action against North Korea. Even without a usable nuclear weapon and without actively invading South Korea, the Kim regime could inflict devastating damage and probably end the US-South Korean alliance as we know it. Given the sheer size of the People's Army, the power of its artillery, its dense air defences and South Korea's reluctance to support any US military action, this option is extremely far-fetched. Any attempt to actually invade North Korea would require months of visible US military build-up, full-scale South Korean participation and a way to guarantee the neutralisation of North Korea's mysterious nuclear capabilities. It would also cost hundreds of thousands of lives on both sides. North Korea has been working on its missile programme for decades, with weapons based on the Soviet-developed Scud It has conducted short- and medium-range tests on many occasions, sometimes to mark domestic events or at times of regional tension In recent months the pace of testing has increased; experts say North Korea appears to be making significant advances towards its goal of building a reliable long-range, nuclear-capable weapon In July, North Korea launched two missiles that it said were Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs) capable of hitting the US; experts believe they put parts of the US in range There is no consensus on how close North Korea is to miniaturising a nuclear warhead to put on a missile Have North Korea's missile tests paid off? In addition to heavy artillery bombardments, the People's Army has long trained for large-scale commando infiltration into South Korea, using low, slow-flying biplanes which are hard to detect on radar, small boats and midget submarines. These would add to the chaos and loss of life in the event of any large-scale conflict, and ensure that the comparatively fewer, albeit much higher-technology US and South Korean forces would be stretched painfully thin. The last time the US and its allies advanced into North Korea, during the Korean War in 1950, China entered the war on the side of the North to prevent the establishment of a unified Western-aligned Korea on its land border. Such a development is still something that China is not prepared to contemplate - the main reason it has propped up the Kim regime for so long. Finally, even if somehow these huge problems could be overcome, a successful invasion of North Korea led by the US would leave it responsible for rebuilding a shattered country. North Korea has existed in an unparalleled state of psychological manipulation, chronic economic hardship and isolation for over 60 years. The monumental task of reintegrating East Germany after the Cold War pales in comparison. The reality is that none of the military options available to the US for dealing with North Korea come without high costs and significant risks - considerations that it will have to weigh up against uncertain and problematic potential outcomes.

"A man with Alzheimer's has been paying hundreds of pounds a month for ""unnecessary"" utilities and services, his niece has claimed. Rachel Holdsworth says her uncle, 72, pays bills, including Â£110 for a Sky TV and phone package, Â£120 for gas and electric and Â£35 for boiler servicing. She said she realised he was making the ""unnecessarily large payments"" while helping with his finances. Sky has apologised and said it hoped to find the best deal for her uncle. It said while there was no error with the bill Ms Holdsworth had been given the wrong information about accessing her uncle's account. More stories from across Yorkshire Ms Holdsworth told BBC Radio 5 live her uncle, who lives in Leeds, was diagnosed with Alzheimer's two years ago. She said, along with her mother, she had recently been given access to his bank accounts and had discovered the various payments, including to Sky. However Ms Holdsworth said she then faced difficulty accessing his Sky account as she did not have the necessary password. ""He was paying Â£110 a month to Sky,"" she added. ""We looked at that and thought this can't just be for TV he must have something that's unnecessary and so we tried to get access to his account. ""My first point of contact with them really was just to say 'what possible package could he have theoretically that would come to Â£100 a month?' ""Then we were asking 'how do we get access? How do we find out what he does have?' and we were told that without his account password there was no way. ""Now, he's got Alzheimer's and there's no way he's going to remember his account password."" Ms Holdsworthshared her progress with Sky on Twitter,externaland received hundreds of messages of support from people with similar experiences. A spokeswoman for Sky said Ms Holdsworth's uncle had taken out a package deal four years ago but not made any changes or upgrades. ""We're sorry for the problems Mrs Holdsworth experienced trying to access her uncle's account details,"" she said. ""We'll now work with Mrs Holdsworth to ensure he is on the best package for his needs."" Ms Holdsworth said she believed her uncle's energy bills were the result of ""a legacy tariff from when privatisation happened and he never thought to get any kind of discount"". Regarding the boiler maintenance payments she said her uncle ""lives in a council house so it's all covered by his rent"". She laterposted on Twitter,external: ""As an aside, I believe that any company whose charging policy relies on the customer to actively chose a tariff that doesn't rinse them is unethical and unfairly penalises vulnerable people."" Gavin Terry, policy manager at Alzheimer's Society, said it was important for staff to be trained to spot the signs of vulnerability ""so they can speak to customers appropriately and advise on deals that meet their needs"". ""Sadly we hear all too often about instances of people with dementia paying through the nose for services, and occasionally even being subject to deliberate exploitation, across a whole range of industries,"" he added.

"This video can not be played Theresa May says Japan is ""a long-standing partner"" of the UK and that will continue Theresa May has said China must do more to help end North Korea's ""illegal and provocative"" weapons testing. On a visit to Japan, the prime minister welcomed UN condemnation of Pyongyang and said the UK was looking at ways of exerting further pressure on the North Korean regime, including from China. Mrs May is also aiming to allay Japan's concerns over Brexit and drum up trade. She said Japanese firms continued to make ""important"" investments in the UK as EU withdrawal was being negotiated. She hailed British carmaker Aston Martin's decision to invest Â£500m in Japan as a sign of the strength of the two countries' economic partnership. The luxury brand announced on Wednesday it would significantly step up its exports to Japan, open a number of new offices next year and expand its dealer network. Reality Check: Japan's position on UK trade deal Can the world live with a nuclear North Korea? N Korea threatens further Pacific action North Korea: What does 'provocative' test show? Japan is preoccupied with the issue of North Korea's missile test over its northern Hokkaido island. Speaking to the BBC after arriving for a three day visit, Mrs May urged China to exert its influence over Pyongyang. ""I want to work with other international partners to do what we all want to do which is to stop North Korea from conducting these illegal activities,"" she said. The prime minister took part in a traditional tea drinking ceremony on her first day in Japan The two leaders then shared a dinner, whose menu included pike conger soup and red rockfish sashimi ""These are illegal tests. It is outrageous, it is provocative and they should be stopped."" The UK was working to see what ""further pressure"" could be brought on North Korea, including extending sanctions, and the role that China could play in facilitating such action. But asked about the comments, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said the focus should be on de-escalating tensions in the Korean peninsula and ""just chanting about sanctions"" was not the answer. Meeting late on Tuesday in New York, the United Nations Security Council called the launch ""outrageous"", demanding North Korea cease all missile testing. But North Korea has signalled plans for more launches, suggesting its firing of a missile over Japan was ""the first step"" of military operations in the Pacific. Aston Martin in Â£500m UK-Japan deal Juncker criticises UK Brexit negotiations Mr Abe greeted his counterpart when she arrived in Kyoto before the two leaders went to a teahouse for a traditional tea-drinking ceremony, followed by a formal dinner at the Kyoto State Guest House. They then took the bullet train to Tokyo, where formal talks will take place on Thursday. Downing Street said the two leaders had discussed the Brexit process to date and the UK's position on key issues. Mrs May, who is being accompanied on the trip by International Trade Secretary Liam Fox and a delegation of business leaders drawn from a range of sectors, told her counterpart that the UK saw Japan's proposed free trade deal with the EU as a ""good basis"" for the beginning of a future UK trading agreement with Japan. The UK is unable to sign any bilateral deals until it has left the EU in 2019. Japan has been forthright in expressing concerns about Brexit's impact on its UK-based firms, which employ about 140,000 people. Mr Abe will be seeking assurances from Theresa May about what kind of relationship the UK will have with the EU post-Brexit and that this will not be detrimental to Japanese businesses with bases in the UK. Although the UK would be leaving the single market, Mrs May told journalists she had also made clear she wanted to minimise disruption for foreign investors by putting in place transitional arrangements to ensure a ""smooth path"" after the UK leaves in 2019. She added: ""Japan is a longstanding partner of the UK with significant investments in the UK. We have seen Softbank, Toyota investing in the UK since the EU referendum took place."" ""These are important developments for our economy and relationship with Japan."" A special adviser to Mr Abe, Tomohiko Taniguchi, told BBC Radio 4's Today there was uneasiness about Brexit within the Japanese business community but talk of a crisis in relations was over-stated as Japanese firms had an ""inherent preference"" for doing business in Britain. Nomura bank, Hitachi and carmakers Honda, Nissan and Toyota all have bases in the UK. Earlier this year, Nissan said it would build two new models - the new Qashqai and X-Trail - at its Sunderland plant after the government promised that competitiveness would not be damaged by EU withdrawal.

"The West Ham striker previously told the court he hit about 10 cars in his effort to get away A man accused of attempting to rob Premier League footballer Andy Carroll of his Â£22,000 watch hid under a mattress when police arrived to arrest him, a court has heard. The West Ham player, who has nine England caps, told Basildon Crown Court he was returning home from training when he was chased by two motorcyclists on 2 November 2016. Jack O'Brien, 22, was arrested 10 days after the alleged attempted robbery. Mr O'Brien denies attempted robbery. Prosecutor Simon Gladwell said police arrested Mr O'Brien at a house in Dagenham, where they found him in the front bedroom ""hiding in the bed frame under the mattress"". Mr Gladwell said police seized a crash helmet and Ducati jacket at the east London property and a Suzuki motorbike was seized from the back garden. ""The motorcycle used in the alleged attempted robbery was the same motorcycle that was seized at the time of Jack O'Brien's arrest,"" he added. The court heard that the rider of the bike used in the alleged attempted robbery wore the same crash helmet and jacket seized at the time of Mr O'Brien's arrest. Mr Gladwell said Mr O'Brien had pleaded guilty to a string of burglaries in October and November 2016 in April, in which items including jewellery, watches and cash were stolen. ""At the time of each of the burglaries Jack O'Brien used the same motorcycle that was used in the attempted robbery of Andy Carroll,"" said Mr Gladwell. He added that in each of the burglaries Mr O'Brien also used the same crash helmet and jacket worn by the biker in the attempted robbery of Mr Carroll. Michael Edmonds, defending, said Mr O'Brien, of Navarre Gardens, Romford, east London, was not the biker. He said Mr O'Brien had used the motorcycle, jacket and helmet for crime before, but that it was he was not using the bike on that occasion. The trial continues.

"This is, by any standards, the most provocative of North Korea's recent missile tests. Launching a rocket over Japanese territory- with at least the possibility that it could break up and deposit debris on Japanese soil - shows that Pyongyang is intent on maintaining its brinkmanship - this was only the third missile test to over-fly Japan within the past two decades. However, this may perhaps be brinkmanship only to a point. It is noteworthy that North Korea did not make good on its threat to direct a missile towards the US Pacific territory of Guam - something that might well have precipitated a US military response. But equally clearly it shows that the Trump administration's assertions earlier this month - after a round of escalating threats between Washington and Pyongyang - that the North Korean regime was now pausing for thought, were premature. So here we are again, facing the question of what to do about North Korea as it moves rapidly forward with its linked ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programmes. Or, to put the question another way, if these programmes cannot be stopped, and Pyongyang eventually gets the ability to target the continental USA with a nuclear-armed missile, can the US and the world live with a nuclear-armed North Korea? There are five declared nuclear weapons states: Britain, France, the US, China and Russia. They mostly developed their nuclear weapons arsenals in the aftermath of World War Two, which had seen a frightening demonstration of the power of ""the Bomb"" with its use by the Americans against two Japanese cities. China was a relative latecomer to the nuclear ""club"", joining in the mid-1960s. Since then, efforts to prevent the spread or proliferation of nuclear weapons have been remarkably successful. The Non-Proliferation Treaty - which entered into force in 1970 - made the clear distinction between the declared nuclear weapons states and everyone else. Have North Korea's missile tests paid off? What can the outside world do? Can the US defend itself against North Korea? The North Korea crisis in 300 words The deal was that the declared nuclear states would seek to cut - and eventually eliminate - their arsenals, while the rest would get the benefits of peaceful nuclear technology by agreeing never to seek nuclear weapons. Either through the Non-Proliferation Treaty, by military threat - as in the case of Iraq and Libya - or by additional agreements - such as the understanding with Iran - very few countries have sought to develop nuclear arsenals. Some, who had relatively advanced weapons programmes, like South Africa, abandoned them altogether. Three countries who never signed up to the NPT deal did develop nuclear weapons arsenals: Israel, India and Pakistan. But, while their programmes remain for some controversial, they are only seen as a threat in a regional context, though Pakistan's nuclear security and its proliferation activities in the past have rung alarm bells more widely. So what would it mean if North Korea joined this trio? Indeed, for practical purposes, it already is a nuclear-armed state. It is its capacity to strike US cities that is still in doubt. Well, for one thing North Korea is clearly the odd man out. It is not a democracy, it is not in any sense an ally of the United States. It is peculiarly isolated from the international system and despite its bluster it is fundamentally a weak and failing regime. And - unlike Israel, India and Pakistan - its nuclear weapons are not solely intended to deter regional rivals. It seeks a capacity to strike the United States itself. So could the US and North Korea simply co-exist as nuclear ""rivals"", bearing in mind that the American nuclear punch far outweighs anything deliverable by Pyongyang? Many argue that nuclear deterrence helped keep the peace during the Cold War, with the US and the then Soviet Union able to destroy each other many times over. Could Cold War-style deterrence come to mark the relationship between North Korea and the US? Deterrence evolved into a complex theory and practice; a language that in many ways Moscow and Washington shared. But it is hard to see Washington and Pyongyang developing that sort of common understanding. There was a time, of course, when all this seemed theoretical. North Korea was testing its missiles and developing its nuclear capability but its progress was slow - the idea that it might ever threaten the continental United States, decades away. Well, now that moment is fast approaching. The goal was then to halt and roll back the North Korean programme; basically to get it to abandon its nuclear weapons ambitions. Such hopes proved illusory. So what are the key points to bear in mind at the moment? A drama or a crisis? North Korea's progress has been remarkable and worrying but it is not there yet. As the veteran US strategic analyst Tony Cordesman has noted: ""Testing a missile booster and a re-entry vehicle is a long way from having an actual operational missile. Having a design capability to make a relatively small fission warhead is a long way from having produced and tested an actual warhead design."" Might Pyongyang seek to use its fledgling capability against the US? Well, Tony Cordesman is blunt: ""Firing an unproven missile with an unproven warhead in an unproven re-entry vehicle with unproved accuracy and reliability at these ranges against a major nuclear power goes from stupidity to insanity."" His view seems to be that North Korea is getting ever closer to its goal but this requires a coherent policy response not rhetorical bluster and threats. China's influence President Trump has sought to double-down on Beijing in an effort to get it to force Pyongyang to back down. Well, this has had mixed results. China has supported much tougher sanctions imposed through the UN, but it has responded angrily to bilateral sanctions imposed by the US that hit Chinese individuals or enterprises. Chinese pressure is one of the few levers against Pyongyang but its influence should not be over-stated. In the final analysis, China does not want to see the North Korean regime swept away and millions of refugees flood across its border. So it will always be ambivalent, sharing US concerns but only up to a point. China and North Korea's foreign ministers met at the Asean summit in Manila in April The regional question It is easy to see this as a struggle between two mercurial leaders, President Trump and the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. But it is vastly more complex than that. There is the inter-Korean dimension, there is the Japanese dimension, there is the wider relationship that these two countries have with both Washington and Beijing. And then there is the wider strategic calculus. The growing threat from North Korea could lead to significant rearmament in the region. The growing popularity of ballistic missile defence has already prompted tensions between South Korea and China. Russia, too, will be watching the development of these defences closely. A multi-dimensional approach? If North Korea continues on this trajectory then a new policy of deterrence and containment needs to be crafted. But it needs to be one that doesn't simply make matters worse. Some of the elements of such a policy have already been mentioned above: tougher economic sanctions against North Korea that China can buy into, better defensive weaponry for America's allies in the region including anti-missile systems, a clear show of US resolve, if need be to extend its nuclear umbrella over its Asian allies in the same way that it does with its European allies within Nato. But in and of themselves many of these steps will simply make the North Koreans feel more under threat, so there needs to be an additional dimensionâ¦ North Korea has been subject to UN sanctions since 2006 over its ballistic missile and nuclear programmes A clear diplomatic pathway Diplomacy under the Trump administration has got a bad rap. Look at his opposition to the nuclear agreement with Iran. But just imagine if there was a similar deal in place with Pyongyang. That is not really a feasible proposition but the point remains that in a substantially deteriorating situation even an agreement that slows or delays North Korea's progress might be better than nothing. Former US diplomats have cautioned that past diplomatic engagement with ""the hermit kingdom"" is often unfairly written off. True, the deal that froze North Korea's nuclear activities in the mid-1990s eventually collapsed. But Pyongyang's nuclear progress was frozen for several years. Another agreement in 2000, freezing North Korea's long-range missile programme, similarly collapsed. But the key takeaway here is that the record shows it was US actions as much as North Korea's that ended these deals. The North Korean regime, many analysts argue, is not quite as crazy as it seems. There is a logic behind its behaviour and there are things that it wants. A peace deal on the Korean peninsula; economic development; a commitment by the US not to seek regime change; these are all the potential currency for diplomatic exchanges in the future. This, as ever, is a problem with few good alternatives on offer. The goal needs to be to avoid the very worst outcomes and to favour the least bad. Diplomacy, coercion, sanctions, deterrence, all have a part to play. The question remains whether this US administration is capable of rising to the challenge and whether the North Korean regime is prepared genuinely to bargain if it were to receive tangible gains.

"Aston Martin has announced a Â£500m trade and investment deal between the United Kingdom and Japan. The luxury car brand said on Wednesday it would step up its exports to Japan, open a number of new offices next year and expand its dealer network. The five-year deal will benefit its plants in St Athan in Vale of Glamorgan and Gaydon in Warwickshire. Prime Minister Theresa May said the investment was ""vital"" as Britain prepares to leave the EU. The announcement was made by the company's president and chief executive officer, Dr Andy Palmer, during his visit to Japan as part of theUK delegation accompanying Mrs May. The prime minister is aiming to allay Japan's concerns over Brexit and drum up trade during the visit. ""As we prepare to leave the European Union, it is vital that we build on our existing ties with friends and allies,"" Mrs May said. ""Aston Martin is a prime example of the innovative and world leading firms the UK is proud of and I'm delighted they are joining me on this important trade mission."" The Aston Martin DBX was unveiled in Geneva last year Exports from its St Athan and Gaydon plants, worth more than Â£400m, boosted by new sports cars and the introduction of the company's first sports utility vehicle Buying more than Â£70m in components from Japanese suppliers including Bridgestone, Denso, Mitsubishi and Yazaki The creation of an Aston Martin Meta Technology and Luxury Accelerator office in Japan, to open in 2018 Investments in a flagship global brand centre in Tokyo, new Aston Martin Japan HQ and further growth of the Aston Martin dealer network across Japan She said it would help safeguard jobs at the two UK plants and would open ""new possibilities for future deals with Japan"". ""We've seen SoftBank, Nissan, Toyota investing in the UK since the referendum vote took place and, as part of the visit here today, a Â£500m Aston Martin deal,"" she added. ""These are important developments for our economy and for the relationship with Japan."" This video can not be played Theresa May said several Japanese firms had invested in the UK since the Brexit vote Dr Palmer said Japan was ""key to our future plans as we completely revitalise and expand our product portfolio"". ""We have long enjoyed a loyal following from Japanese customers and the public alike, with our new dealership in Tokyo set to become our largest worldwide by volume,"" he said. The announcement was also welcomed by Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns, who has previouslyissued reassurances over Wales-Japan businessfollowing Brexit. He said: ""The UK government is building a truly global Britain by helping UK companies like Aston Martin to export their products across the globe, and supporting high value jobs here in Wales. ""As we prepare to exit the EU, we are determined that our country remains a great place to invest and to do business."" Aston Martin currently exports a range of four sports cars to Japan including the new DB11 model. In late 2019, the company will introduce a sports utility vehicle built at the company's second manufacturing facility at St Athan. The super-hangar, which employs 750 highly-skilled workers, is alreadyset to build its new DBX model from 2020, following financial support from the Welsh Government. Wales beat off more than 20 other countries to secure the deal, which was announced early last year. Analysis by Brian Meechan, BBC Wales business correspondent The Raspberry Pi computer is designed to teach children about programming The Aston Martin deal further cements links between the two countries. Japanese companies employ 6,500 people in Wales. They include 540 working at Sony in Pencoed, many making the best-selling British computer of all time, the Raspberry Pi. Altogether, 10 million of them have now been made. Japan already plays a major part in the automotive industry in Wales. Toyota employs more than 500 people on Deeside making car engines. Hitachi is building the new nuclear power station on Anglesey, Wylfa Newydd, as well as providing the trains that will run on the electrified rail lines between London and Cardiff. The drop in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote has made it cheaper to sell goods to countries such as Japan. However, uncertainty remains for many businesses over what future trading relationships will look like after the UK leaves the EU.

The company said the stolen data included customers' names, addresses, email addresses, phone numbers and some old credit card information.

It said an ""unauthorised third party"" had accessed online account holder data, but stressed that in-store data had not been affected. Affected customers have been sent an email offering guidance. The company said some encrypted credit card information had been compromised, but since the retailer stopped storing credit card information in 2009, those details were likely to have expired, making them useless to criminals.

"One in five people struggling with debts has seen their credit card limit automatically increased - a higher proportion than for cardholders in general, a charity has claimed. Citizens Advice said 18% of those struggling financially had seen the limit increased without request, compared with 12% overall. It wants a ban on increases without a cardholder's explicit consent. The regulator has estimated that 3.3 million people are in persistent debt. In a report published earlier this year, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said that ""customers in persistent debt are profitable for credit card firms, who do not routinely intervene to help them"". Unarranged overdrafts charges could be banned How much can I get for my false teeth? Doorstep lender Provident's shares plunge Recent industry figures have also shown a rise in the use of credit, debit and charge cards. The number of transactions grew by 12% in the year to the end of June, the highest annual rate since 2008. Meanwhile the value of spending also rose, accelerating to 7.2%. Citizens Advice said that poor affordability checks by lenders were making people's financial situations worse. ""It is clear that irresponsible behaviour by some lenders is making people's debt situation worse - such as offering more credit when they already have thousands of pounds of unpaid debt,"" said Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice. ""The regulator must ensure that lenders are taking into account people's whole financial and personal situation before agreeing further credit. ""Banning firms from raising existing customers' credit limits without seeking their express permission first would also help people take more control over their finances,"" she added. Jon Pearson, a former IT engineer, told Wake up to Money on BBC Radio 5 live about his experiences. He got into debt a few years ago and ended up owing Â£35,000, spread over three credit cards. Part of the problem, he said, was that there seemed to be no limit on his borrowing. ""I never applied to any card company to raise my [borrowing] limits - they just did it without me asking for it,"" he said. A spokesman for the industry body UK Finance said: ""Helping customers struggling with persistent credit card debt is a priority for our members. ""The industry has already developed a number of proposals to address the regulator's concerns and ensure that no customer in persistent debt will be offered a credit limit increase. ""Where customers are in financial difficulty, the industry introduced a breathing space to allow customers to engage with a debt advice provider,"" he added. Lenders face anupcoming deadlineto prove to regulators that they are not lending recklessly. The Bank of England has consistently expressed the need for vigilance over growth in the consumer credit market during ""benign"" economic conditions, at a time when household income has been relatively stagnant. The FCA has also suggested that credit card companies could cancel any interest or charges in extreme cases. Firms should have to work more closely with people in debt, such as drawing up a faster repayment plan, it proposed.

"This video can not be played Tens of thousands were stranded as the city ground to a halt Monsoon rains have killed at least five people, including two toddlers, in Mumbai as India's financial capital ground to a halt under flooding. Roads flooded waist-deep, flights were cancelled and train services suspended, stranding tens of thousands. More rain is expected but the situation has improved for now, the BBC's Suranjana Tewari says. The rains in Mumbai follow devastating floods across a swathe of South Asia, which have killed more than 1,200. At least 500 of the deaths happened in the northern Indian state of Bihar, according to officials. Some 16 million people have been affected across South Asia, say aid workers. They estimate that tens of thousands of people have been displaced. Mumbai has seen a slow return to normality, although schools and offices remain closed on Wednesday. Suranjana Tewari, BBC news, Mumbai Mumbai is no stranger to flooding during the monsoons. Many people were comparing Tuesday's downpour to the devastating floods of 2005 which submerged much of the city and took more than 500 lives. By Wednesday morning, it was clear that this flooding was not nearly as bad. On the streets, it feels rather like a bank holiday. With offices and schools shut, there are fewer people on the roads and most who are out are heading home after spending the night at their workplaces. Offices across the city turned into makeshift dormitories with companies organising food for stranded employees. Now the focus turns to what could have been done to prevent the paralysis of a major financial hub. Many people on Twitter are blaming plastic litter for clogging up drains and waterways. Residents took to social media to offer shelter to the stranded, or to ask for help. This video can not be played More heavy rain for parts of India and Pakistan People opened up their homes to strangers, using the hashtag #RainHosts, along with their contact details. The AFP news agency quoted a local official as saying that they were monitoring the situation. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) has called the South Asian floods one of the worst regional humanitarian crises in years.

"North Korea's official news agency distributed this photo, purportedly of the rocket launch Many pages of the papers are devoted to the crisis in North Korea. Forthe Daily Express,,externalthe firing of a missile over Japan has left the world teetering ""on the brink"" of war. With Theresa May beginning a three-day visit to Japan,the Daily Telegraph,externalreveals that the prime minister will be told to follow the country's emergency ""duck and cover"" drill if another missile is unleashed by Pyongyang. ""What should the West do?"" asksthe Daily Mail,,externalturning to a crisis research specialist, Mark Almond, for the answer. Diplomacy has a ""poor track record in Pygongyang"", he says, while sanctions are ""slow to deliver"". A limited strike could lead to all-out war and a full invasion would leave the US exposed elsewhere. The Daily Mirror's head of politics, Jason Beattie, believes there is ""no good"" solution. He argues that striking first against Pyongyang would leave South Korea at risk of retaliation, assassinating Kim Jong-un would not necessarily resolve the crisis, and diplomacy relies too much on China.

"One in five people struggling with debts has seen their credit card limit automatically increased - a higher proportion than for cardholders in general, a charity has claimed. Citizens Advice said 18% of those struggling financially had seen the limit increased without request, compared with 12% overall. It wants a ban on increases without a cardholder's explicit consent. The regulator has estimated that 3.3 million people are in persistent debt. In a report published earlier this year, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said that ""customers in persistent debt are profitable for credit card firms, who do not routinely intervene to help them"". Unarranged overdrafts charges could be banned How much can I get for my false teeth? Doorstep lender Provident's shares plunge Recent industry figures have also shown a rise in the use of credit, debit and charge cards. The number of transactions grew by 12% in the year to the end of June, the highest annual rate since 2008. Meanwhile the value of spending also rose, accelerating to 7.2%. Citizens Advice said that poor affordability checks by lenders were making people's financial situations worse. ""It is clear that irresponsible behaviour by some lenders is making people's debt situation worse - such as offering more credit when they already have thousands of pounds of unpaid debt,"" said Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice. ""The regulator must ensure that lenders are taking into account people's whole financial and personal situation before agreeing further credit. ""Banning firms from raising existing customers' credit limits without seeking their express permission first would also help people take more control over their finances,"" she added. Jon Pearson, a former IT engineer, told Wake up to Money on BBC Radio 5 live about his experiences. He got into debt a few years ago and ended up owing Â£35,000, spread over three credit cards. Part of the problem, he said, was that there seemed to be no limit on his borrowing. ""I never applied to any card company to raise my [borrowing] limits - they just did it without me asking for it,"" he said. A spokesman for the industry body UK Finance said: ""Helping customers struggling with persistent credit card debt is a priority for our members. ""The industry has already developed a number of proposals to address the regulator's concerns and ensure that no customer in persistent debt will be offered a credit limit increase. ""Where customers are in financial difficulty, the industry introduced a breathing space to allow customers to engage with a debt advice provider,"" he added. Lenders face anupcoming deadlineto prove to regulators that they are not lending recklessly. The Bank of England has consistently expressed the need for vigilance over growth in the consumer credit market during ""benign"" economic conditions, at a time when household income has been relatively stagnant. The FCA has also suggested that credit card companies could cancel any interest or charges in extreme cases. Firms should have to work more closely with people in debt, such as drawing up a faster repayment plan, it proposed.

"This video can not be played Traffic rolls on Scotland's new Queensferry Crossing Drivers have faced long delays as the new Â£1.35bn crossing over the Forth officially opened to traffic. The first vehicles travelled across the Queensferry Crossing in the early hours. Motorists faced delays of more than an hour during both the morning and evening rush hours, especially northbound. Officials believe traffic was heavier than expected because of sightseers wanting to cross the bridge. The crossing is essentially an extension of the M90 motorway across the Forth with a 70mph speed limit, although operators said an initial 40mph limit will be in place to take account of ""driver distraction"". Earlier, the bridge was hit by its first breakdown when a lorry stopped at about 07:00. Traffic Scotland tweeted: ""First breakdown on the @FRC-Queensferry. Mostly on hard shoulder but bum sticking out...slightly!"" The first vehicles make their way in convoy across the Queensferry Crossing By rush hour, roads leading to the new bridge were congested The new bridge will take most of the traffic that currently uses the 53-year-old Forth Road Bridge. The old one will remain open for cyclists, pedestrians and buses. The Queensferry Crossing will be closed again at the weekend to allow members of the public to walk across it. About 50,000 people were given tickets after a ballot for a ""once-in-a-lifetime"" chance to walk over the new bridge on Saturday and Sunday. There will then be a royal visit from the Queen next Monday, ahead of the bridge fully opening later next week. Vehicles were led in convoy after the crossing opened Traffic makes its way along the southbound carriageway for the first time On Monday night a collection of vintage, modern and electric vehicles drove on the bridge in a procession to mark the symbolic handover from contractors to the Scottish government. Everything you need to know about the Queensferry Crossing It was followed by a light show across the bridge to celebrate the completion of the biggest infrastructure project in Scotland in a generation. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon took part in the procession on Monday night and thanked workers for their efforts. This video can not be played The new Â£1.35bn Queensferry Crossing comes to life in multi-colour Economy Secretary Keith Brown said: ""It's fantastic. You immediately notice coming over the new bridge - as traffic is now doing - the absence of the slap, slap, slap that you get on the existing bridge. ""It's a very smooth passage right across the Queensferry Crossing. Also, just the excitement of looking at this fantastic new structure from a new angle. ""I think it will be extremely well-received by the people in Scotland who are going to use this bridge."" He added: ""It has wind protection, which we couldn't put on the old bridge. ""It will mean this bridge should virtually never have to close because of high winds, which frequently happens on the old bridge. The 1.7-mile crossing has a design life of 120 years ""So it's a different kind of bridge and it benefits from the advances we have had in engineering. It's a superb addition to the landscape here at the Forth."" The 1.7-mile crossing has a design life of 120 years but could last longer as it has been ""designed for maintenance"" to ensure it runs smoothly for decades. To avoid closures the existing bridge has faced in bad weather, wind barriers that can withstand the strongest gusts have been installed along the Queensferry Crossing. About 1,000 sensors have been fitted to give advanced warning of any problems, allowing maintenance teams to pre-empt potential issues. The new crossing will close again at the weekend Friday 1 September Early in the morning, the Queensferry Crossing will close again to all traffic. Police will redirect all vehicles back across the Forth Road Bridge. It will remain closed until the early hours of Thursday. Saturday 2 and Sunday 3 September About 50,000 members of the public, who were given tickets after a ballot, will get a ""once in a lifetime"" chance to walk over the new bridge on Saturday and Sunday. The Queen will officially open the Queensferry Crossing. She will be joined by the Duke of Edinburgh. The Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland will bless the bridge, and the Queen will cut a ribbon on the south side. Tuesday 5 September A chance for a further 10,000 local people and school children to walk the bridge. Thursday 7 September The bridge will re-open to traffic, with no pedestrian access. The initial speed limit will be 40mph but after work has been completed to adapt the Forth Road Bridge public transport will be switched back to the old bridge and the Queensferry Crossing will become a 70mph motorway.

"One in five people struggling with debts has seen their credit card limit automatically increased - a higher proportion than for cardholders in general, a charity has claimed. Citizens Advice said 18% of those struggling financially had seen the limit increased without request, compared with 12% overall. It wants a ban on increases without a cardholder's explicit consent. The regulator has estimated that 3.3 million people are in persistent debt. In a report published earlier this year, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said that ""customers in persistent debt are profitable for credit card firms, who do not routinely intervene to help them"". Unarranged overdrafts charges could be banned How much can I get for my false teeth? Doorstep lender Provident's shares plunge Recent industry figures have also shown a rise in the use of credit, debit and charge cards. The number of transactions grew by 12% in the year to the end of June, the highest annual rate since 2008. Meanwhile the value of spending also rose, accelerating to 7.2%. Citizens Advice said that poor affordability checks by lenders were making people's financial situations worse. ""It is clear that irresponsible behaviour by some lenders is making people's debt situation worse - such as offering more credit when they already have thousands of pounds of unpaid debt,"" said Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice. ""The regulator must ensure that lenders are taking into account people's whole financial and personal situation before agreeing further credit. ""Banning firms from raising existing customers' credit limits without seeking their express permission first would also help people take more control over their finances,"" she added. Jon Pearson, a former IT engineer, told Wake up to Money on BBC Radio 5 live about his experiences. He got into debt a few years ago and ended up owing Â£35,000, spread over three credit cards. Part of the problem, he said, was that there seemed to be no limit on his borrowing. ""I never applied to any card company to raise my [borrowing] limits - they just did it without me asking for it,"" he said. A spokesman for the industry body UK Finance said: ""Helping customers struggling with persistent credit card debt is a priority for our members. ""The industry has already developed a number of proposals to address the regulator's concerns and ensure that no customer in persistent debt will be offered a credit limit increase. ""Where customers are in financial difficulty, the industry introduced a breathing space to allow customers to engage with a debt advice provider,"" he added. Lenders face anupcoming deadlineto prove to regulators that they are not lending recklessly. The Bank of England has consistently expressed the need for vigilance over growth in the consumer credit market during ""benign"" economic conditions, at a time when household income has been relatively stagnant. The FCA has also suggested that credit card companies could cancel any interest or charges in extreme cases. Firms should have to work more closely with people in debt, such as drawing up a faster repayment plan, it proposed.
