"A group of London business leaders has written to the government calling for financial support for the struggling rail firm Eurostar. In a letter to the Treasury and Department for Transport, they urge ""swift action to safeguard its future"". Bosses of firms such as Fortnum & Mason signed the letter asking for access to government loans and business rates relief ""at the very least"". The government says it is ""working closely"" with Eurostar. The cross-Channel rail company is threatened by a large drop in passenger numbers due to coronavirus-related travel restrictions. It reported in November that passenger numbers had been down 95% since March 2020. With two trains an hour normally scheduled in peak hours, it now runs just two services a day from London to Paris and Brussels. The letter, coordinated by business campaigning group London First and seen by the BBC, describes the firm as one that has ""fallen through the cracks"". Unlike some airlines, it has not been eligible for government-backed loans. ""If this viable business is allowed to fall between the cracks of support - neither an airline, nor a domestic railway - our recovery could be damaged,"" it says. Co-signed by 28 leaders, including the vice-chancellor of Middlesex University, the chief executive of West End property company Shaftesbury, as well as the boss of the ExCeL conference centre, the letter points out that the company currently employs 1,200 people in the UK. The firm is 55% owned by French state rail firm SNCF.The UK government sold its stakein the business to private companies for Â£757m in 2015. Government urged to intervene amid fears for Eurostar jobs What are the new UK travel rules? The letter also credits Eurostar with reducing carbon emissions. Since it launched in 1994, it has transported more than 190 million passengers between Britain and mainland Europe. A spokesman for Eurostar said: ""Without additional funding from government there is a real risk to the survival of Eurostar, the green gateway to Europe. He described the current situation as ""very serious"". A spokesman for the Department for Transport said: ""We recognise the significant financial challenges facing Eurostar as a result of Covid-19 and the unprecedented circumstances currently faced by the international travel industry."" He added the government had been in contact with Eurostar ""on a regular basis"" since the start of the coronavirus crisis and would continue to work closely with the firm.

"Within seconds of being dropped, LauncherOne had ignited its engine Sir Richard Branson's rocket company Virgin Orbit has succeeded in putting its first satellites in space. Ten payloads in total were lofted on the same rocket, which was launched from under the wing of one of the entrepreneur's old 747 jumbos. Sir Richard is hoping to tap into what is a growing market for small, lower-cost satellites. By using a jet plane as the launch platform, he can theoretically send up spacecraft from anywhere in the world.Â In reality, of course, his Virgin Orbit system has to be licensed in the locality where it is used, which at the moment is solely California. But there are well-advanced plans to bring the 747 and its rockets to Cornwall in south-west England, for example. Nasa's 'megarocket' engine test ends early UK industry bids farewell to EU's Galileo system EU must 'move at speed' on space broadband network Sunday's success was a big fillip for Sir Richard's team who had tried and failed to launch a rocket in May last year. That effort was thwarted by a breached propellant line feeding liquid oxygen to the booster's first-stage Newton-3 engine. No such problems occurred this time. The modified 747, named Cosmic Girl, left its base in California's Mojave desert at 10:50 PST (18:50 UTC) to fly out over the Pacific Ocean. A little under 60 minutes later, and cruising at 35,000ft (10,500m), the jet banked hard to the right, dropping as it did so the 21m-long rocket that had been clamped to its underside. Within seconds this booster, called LauncherOne, had ignited its engine and was climbing to space. Correct deployment of the various spacecraft onboard at an altitude of roughly 500km was confirmed a couple of hours later. ""A new gateway to space has just sprung open,"" said Virgin Orbit CEO Dan Hart. ""That LauncherOne was able to successfully reach orbit today is a testament to this team's talent, precision, drive, and ingenuity."" LauncherOne's ascent photographed from a chase plane Sir Richard has been trying to find the right solution to get into the satellite launch businesssince 2009,external. His concrete proposal was first put before the public at the Farnborough International Air Showthree years later. There is an emerging market for small, lower-cost spacecraft, whose developers are seeking more flexible and affordable ways of getting their assets above the Earth. Virgin Orbit is one of a number of companies now racing to meet this demand. Other contenders include the Rocket Lab outfit, which sends up its vehicles from a ground launch pad in New Zealand. But there are tens of other small rocket start-ups at various stages of maturation, and some of these plan to operate from the UK as well. ""Virgin Orbit has achieved something many thought impossible. It was so inspiring to see our specially adapted Virgin Atlantic 747, Cosmic Girl, send the LauncherOne rocket soaring into orbit,"" Sir Richard said. ""This magnificent flight is the culmination of many years of hard work and will also unleash a whole new generation of innovators on the path to orbit. I can't wait to see the incredible missions Dan and the team will launch to change the world for good."" Sir Richard presented the LauncherOne concept at Farnborough in 2012 Will Whitehorn is the president of UKSpace, the trade body representing the space industry in Britain. He's also a former president of Virgin Galactic, Sir Richard's other space company which hopes soon to start flying fare-paying passengers above the atmosphere in a rocket plane. He said Virgin Orbit's success on Sunday was hugely significant. ""This is a momentous day for the small satellite world, as we will be able to launch satellites responsively; and for the UK this event promises sovereign launch capability very soon,"" he told BBC News. ""I plan to push hard for a launch from Cornwall to coincide with the G7 meeting this year if at all possible!""

"The assassinations are the latest in a string targeting women in high-profile jobs (file photo) Two women judges working for the Afghan Supreme Court have been shot dead. They were killed by unidentified gunmen on their way to work on Sunday. The deaths are the latest in a string of assassinations targeting journalists, activists and other political figures. The violence comes as President Donald Trump continues a drawdown of US troops in the country - with only 2,500 left. The Afghan vice-president told the BBC this week that the pull-out risks more violencein an unstable country. The women were shot dead in an early morning ambush, which also saw their driver wounded.

"Concerns have been raised about employees forced to go into workplaces that are not Covid-compliant during lockdown. Between 6 and 14 January, the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) received 2,945 complaints about safety issues. The head of the UK's unions called for ministers to crack down on employers ""who break Covid safety rules"". The HSE said it had scaled up its work to check and support firms during the pandemic. TheObserver reports that no companies have been prosecuted,externaland fined for breaking workplace coronavirus safety rules since the start of the latest national lockdown in England, although a spokeswoman for the HSE said figures on enforcement action, which can include verbal advice or a written warning, cannot be verified until Monday. She added that its inspectors ""continue to be out and about, putting employers on the spot and checking that they are complying with health and safety law"". Pimlico Plumbers to make workers get vaccinations Can my boss force me to go to work? The HSE has introduced telephone spot-checks in response to the coronavirus crisis, she said. ""We continue to scale up the number of spot check calls and visits we are doing so we can reach as many businesses as possible during the current lockdown period."" TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: ""If the government is upping enforcement, ministers should start with employers who break Covid safety rules."" She also called for an increase in resources for the HSE ""to stop rogue employers getting away with putting staff at risk. Every employer needs to know an inspection could happen any time"". The HSE has carried out more than 32,300 site visits during the pandemic. The government should also make it clear that everyone who can work from home should do so, Ms O'Grady added. Under current lockdown restrictions, people across the UK who can work effectively from home should do so. They should only travel to their workplace if they cannot do their job remotely. This includes,externalhealthcare professionals, teachers, childcare providers, transport workers, people who work in construction or manufacturing, funeral directors, and essential retail workers. For workplaces that remain open in England, employers must ""carry out an appropriate Covid-19 risk assessment"" to develop a ""specific"" strategy to stop the virus's spread. In England, guidelines set out strict measures,externalwhich employers must follow, such as minimising the number of unnecessary visits to the office, frequent cleaning of workspaces and ensuring that staff observe 2m (6ft) social distancing wherever possible. There is similar guidance for employers across a range of sectors inScotland,external,Wales,externalandNorthern Ireland,external. Read more from our Explainers team here. A spokesperson for the government said: ""The law is clear that people can only leave the home to work if they cannot reasonably work from home. ""We have worked with trade unions, businesses and medical experts to produce comprehensive Covid-secure guidance so that businesses permitted to remain open can do so in a way that is as safe as possible for workers and customers. This is kept under review as our understanding of the virus develops."" A recent survey conducted by the Royal Society for Arts, Manufactures and Commerce (RSA) also suggests that some staff have faced pressure to return to the workplace despite a recent positive coronavirus test. Of 1,172 UK workers surveyed, four in 10 said they had worked within 10 days of a positive result. More than 10% of respondents also said they had been ordered on-site when they could have ""easily"" and ""safely"" worked from home. Brian (not his real name), works cleaning portable toilets on construction sites in south-east England. He told BBC Radio 5 Live that he does not feel safe, but feels ""forced to carry on working so I can pay my bills"". On the site he works at most of the time, he hasn't seen a ""vast amount of mask-wearing"" and says that he has been laughed at for wearing his face mask and visor. ""It's really demoralising because you're laughed at anyway because of the job you're in."" He says the situation is ""50% worse"" than when construction sites were closed during England's first national lockdown. Due to his and his wife's worries, he asked if he could be furloughed, but his firm said that he would only be eligible for Statutory Sick Pay. ""Morale is on the floor,"" he says. Alan Lockey, head of the RSA's future work programme, suggested that workers ""feel forced to put themselves and others at risk of the virus"" because of insecure work and pressure from bosses. He also called on Chancellor Rishi Sunak to end the ""trade-off between health and putting food on the table"" by allowing self-isolating workers to access the government's furlough scheme and maintaining the Â£20-per-week uplift in universal credit, which is due to expire in April.

"MPs have urged Boris Johnson to extend benefit increases worth Â£20 a week. A non-binding Labour motion calling for the universal credit top-up to be kept in place beyond 31 March passed by 278 votes to none after a Commons debate. Six Tory MPs defied party orders to abstain and voted with Labour, adding to the pressure on the PM on the issue. The prime minister said the government had provided Â£280bn worth of support during the pandemic but all measures would be kept under ""constant review"". The motion, which will not automatically lead to a change in policy, was put forward by Labour as a way to put additional pressure on the government to continue the increase, worth Â£1,000 a year. This video can not be played Carl, a roofer, describes going from ""not having enough to barely having enough"" on universal credit. Former Work and Pensions Secretary Stephen Crabb was among six Conservative MPs to rebel, along with Peter Aldous, Robert Halfon, Jason McCartney, Anne Marie Morris and Matthew Offord. Ahead of the vote, Mr Crabb told the BBC that although there were ""difficult pressures on the chancellor"" extending the increase for 12 months was ""the right thing to do"". BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said there weredozens of Conservative MPswho were ""deeply uneasy"" about ending the Â£20 weekly increase to universal credit. She added that it was also understood the cabinet minister with responsibility for benefits, Therese Coffey, was arguing that the uplift should not be dropped in April. Benefit increase only 'temporary', says Raab Ministers urged to extend lockdown benefit 'boost' 'Money is tight' - Living on benefits in lockdown Charities and anti-poverty campaigners are pleading with the government to keep the support in place, describing it as a lifeline for more than 5.5 million families who receive the standard universal credit allowance. Food poverty campaigner and chef Jack Monroe told the BBC that the Â£20 increase ""has been a lifeline"" for millions of people who have needed to top up their income or rely on universal credit payments in order to get by. Sir Keir said the increase was a vital safety net for those who had lost their jobs, seen their working hours slashed or who were not eligible for the government's wage subsidy furlough scheme. ""If we don't give a helping hand to families through this pandemic, then we are going to slow our economic recovery as we come out it. ""We urge Boris Johnson to change course and give families certainty today that their incomes will be protected."" Analysis by chief political correspondent Adam Fleming Six billion pounds of the benefits bill - the difference between poverty or not for 1.2 million families, according to a think tank. The Â£1,040 a year increase to universal credit is a very emotive issue. There's even a battle over what to call it. To the government, its introduction was a one-off boost to cope with a crisis. For Labour, taking it away is a cut. Ministers would prefer we looked at the overall level of support they've provided for workers and businesses during the pandemic. The opposition say the Â£20 a week boost is a powerful symbol of the state's willingness to help. Even the act of debating it today is disputed. Labour say they've got the right occasionally to set the agenda in Parliament. Boris Johnson said his MPs risk abuse from campaigners and protestors if they engage. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation has suggested about 16 million people will be directly affected if the Â£20 is rolled back. It says 500,000 more people will be driven into poverty, including 200,000 children, while a further 500,000 of those already in poverty will find themselves in even worse hardship. However, free market think tank the Institute for Economic Affairs has argued that ""across-the-board benefit increases are a wasteful use of taxpayers' money"" at a time when the government is borrowing ""a hair-raising amount of money"". Universal credit is a single payment replacing old benefits such as housing benefit and child tax credits. You can claim universal credit if you are on a low income or are out of work. The standard allowance varies from around Â£340 to just under Â£600 a month, depending on your age or whether you are single. You may be eligible to receive more money on top of the standard allowance if, for example, you have children or a health condition. Speaking on behalf of the Northern Research Group, Conservative MP John Stevenson said the Â£1,000 increase had been ""a real life-saver for people throughout this pandemic"". ""To end it now would be devastating for the 6 million individuals and families who are already struggling to stay afloat,"" he added. While the vote is not binding, and will not lead to a change in policy, it will increase pressure on the government to keep the increase or come up with an alternative. Labour said the Conservatives' decision to abstain created ""unnecessary uncertainty"" but minister Nadhim Zahawi described the vote as ""a political stunt"". The government says it has strengthened the welfare system with an extra Â£7bn of funding during the pandemic while families struggling with food and household bills can get help through the Â£170m Winter Grant Scheme. Ministers also point to extra support for housing costs, through an increase in local housing allowance for those on housing benefits and hardship payments worth Â£670m next year for those unable to pay their council tax bills.

"Mr Biden is reportedly planning a '10-day blitz' of measures to kickstart presidency Details are emerging of a raft of executive orders planned by US president-elect Joe Biden as soon as he takes office this week. Mr Biden will issue decrees to reverse President Trump's travel bans and re-join the Paris climate accord on his first day, US media report. The president-elect is also expected to focus on reuniting families separated at the US-Mexico border, and to issue mandates on Covid-19 and mask-wearing. He will be inaugurated on Wednesday. All 50 US states are on high alert for possible violence in the run-up to the inauguration ceremony, with National Guard troops deployed in their thousands to guard Washington DC. In the hours after Mr Biden sets foot in the White House, he will embark on a blitz of executive actions designed to signal a clean break from his predecessor's administration, according to a memo seen by US media. Among the orders planned soon after taking office are: A US return to the Paris climate agreement- the global pact on cutting carbon emissions Repealing the controversial travel ban on mostly Muslim-majority countries Mandating the wearing of masks on federal property and when travelling interstate An extension to nationwide restrictions on evictions and foreclosures due to the pandemic The executive orders are just one part of his ambitious plan for his first 10 days in office, according the memo. The President-elect is also expected to send a major new immigration bill to Congress, as well as focusing on passinga $1.9tn (Â£1.4tn) stimulus plan to help the country's economy recover from coronavirus. This video can not be played The US Capitol is on high alert ahead of Biden's inauguration Mr Biden has also said his administration will aim to deliver 100 million Covid-19 jabs in his first 100 days in office - describing the rollout so far as a ""dismal failure"". ""President-elect Biden will take action - not just to reverse the gravest damages of the Trump administration - but also to start moving our country forward,"" incoming White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain wrote in the memo. The president-elect is taking over a country in the midst of an unprecedented pandemic. Daily deaths from Covid-19 are in their thousands and almost 400,000 have lost their lives. On top of the virus raging, the country is reeling from recent political violence. The theme for Mr Biden's inauguration will be ""America United"", with the president-elect focusing on healing political divisions. Vice-President Mike Pence is expected to attend the ceremony, though Mr Trump has said he will not. Mr Biden will be sworn in exactly two weeks after the violent riots at the US Capitol on 6 January which aimed to thwart his election victory. This video can not be played The storming of the US Capitol Even by inauguration standards, the security presence in Washington DC for Wednesday's ceremony is extraordinary. Police describe a 'medieval battle' Trump impeached for 'inciting' US Capitol riot All 50 US states on alert for armed protests Miles of streets have been blocked off with concrete barriers and metal fences, and more than 20,000 National Guard troops are expected to deploy. The FBI has warned of possible violence and armed marches planned by pro-Trump supporters. The tough security measures follow a week in which Donald Trump became the first US president to be impeached twice. Mr Trump will now face a Senate trial on a charge of ""incitement of insurrection"" for the US Capitol violence. The earliest the Senate can receive the charges will be Tuesday - the day before he leaves office - but the timings for the trial remain unclear. When will Trump go on trial in the Senate? Did Trump's words incite rally violence? Republicans clash as Senate trial looms There is some suggestion that the House of Representatives, which voted to impeach Mr Trump last week, could delay sending the articles to the Senate to let Mr Biden push on with his legislative agenda and have his cabinet picks approved first. Democrats and Republicans are also reportedly discussing plans for a ""dual track"" agenda which would allow the Senate to split time between impeachment proceedings and Biden administration business. The 100-seat Senate is now tied between Republicans and Democrats. A two-thirds majority is needed for an impeachment conviction - so 17 Republicans would need to vote against Mr Trump to convict him. This video can not be played ""The precedent will stick with us forever and ever"" Some Republicans have warned the impeachment will further inflame and divide Americans at a time when the nation needs to heal - but Democrats want to push on to convict Mr Trump then block him running from office again. Ten Republicans voted to impeach the president in the Houseand most Republican senators, including leader Mitch McConnell, have not said publicly what their voting intentions in a trial are yet. A president has never been tried after he leaves office. Because the situation is unprecedented, some have even suggested it could be unconstitutional. Officials on both sides are preparing for a trial, though the outgoing president is yet to confirm his legal team. Mr Trump's personal lawyer,Rudy Giuliani, told ABC News on Sunday that he was working on the impeachment defence,external, but a spokesman for the president later said he had not decided on his representation.

"Phil Spector pictured in court during his murder trial US music producer Phil Spector has died at the age of 81, while serving a prison sentence for murder. Spector, who transformed pop with his ""wall of sound"" recordings, worked with the Beatles, the Righteous Brothers and Ike and Tina Turner. In 2009, he was convicted of the 2003 murder of Hollywood actress Lana Clarkson. His death was confirmed by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. ""California Health Care Facility inmate Phillip Spector was pronounced deceased of natural causes at 6:35 p.m. on Saturday, January 16, 2021, at an outside hospital. His official cause of death will be determined by the medical examiner in the San Joaquin County Sheriff's Office,"" it said. Spector produced 20 top 40 hits between 1961 and 1965. His production methods influenced major artists including the Beach Boys and Bruce Springsteen. Obituary: Phil Spector His life was ultimately blighted by drug and alcohol addiction, and he all but retired from the music scene during the 1980s and 1990s. In February 2003, actress Lana Clarkson was found dead at his house in Alhambra, California with a bullet wound to her head. Clarkson, who was known for her work in the sword-and-sorcery genre and starred in films including Barbarian Queen, had met Spector hours earlier at a nightclub. Spector claimed the shooting happened when Clarkson ""kissed the gun"" - but his trial heard from four women who claimed Spector had threatened them with guns in the past when they had spurned his advances. Following an initial mistrial, Spector was convicted of second degree murder and given a sentence of 19 years to life. Lana Clarkson was an actress and model who starred in the film 1985 Barbarian Queen Harvey Phillip Spector was born in New York in 1939, to Russian-Jewish parents. His father killed himself when Spector was a boy, and his mother moved her family to Los Angeles. He began his career in his teens as a performer, forming a band - the Teddy Bears - with three high school friends. They had a hit single in 1958 with a song that took its title from the wording on his father's gravestone: ""To know him is to love him."" The record went to number one on the Billboard Hot 100, but the group split the following year. Spector founded his own record label, Philles, in 1961. He produced high-profile 1960s girl groups such as Crystals and the Ronettes, including on 1963 hits Be My Baby and Baby I Love You. He also worked on The Righteous Brothers' hits You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin' and Unchained Melody. Spector produced hits for The Ronettes, later marrying their lead singer Ronnie Bennett His signature production technique, the ""Wall of Sound,"" involved layering several instruments, including strings, woodwind and brass, to give a lush, orchestral sound. In the early 1970s, Spector collaborated with The Beatles on their final album Let It Be, as well as producing John Lennon's solo album Imagine. As the decade progressed, the much-feted producer became reclusive and disturbing accounts of his behaviour became widespread. Spector is said to have held a gun to singer Leonard Cohen's head during sessions for his album Death of a Ladies' Man. Ronettes lead singer Veronica ""Ronnie"" Bennett, who became Spector's second wife and divorced him in 1974, wrote in her 1990 autobiography that he subjected her to years of horrific abuse. She said he had threatened to kill her and display her body in a glass-topped coffin he kept in her basement. ""I can only say that when I left in the early '70s, I knew that if I didn't leave at that time, I was going to die there,"" Ronnie wrote of the time. Writing on Instagram after her ex-husband's death,external, Ronnie Spector said he had been ""a brilliant producer but a lousy husband"". ""When I was working with Phil Spector, watching him create in the recording studio, I knew I was working with the very best,"" she wrote. ""He was in complete control, directing everyone. So much to love about those days. ""Meeting him and falling in love was like a fairytale,"" she continued. ""The magical music we were able to make together was inspired by our love. I loved him madly, and gave my heart and soul to him. ""Unfortunately Phil was not able to live and function outside of the recording studio. Darkness set in, many lives were damaged."" Singer Darlene Love, who sang on several songs Spector produced, said he ""changed the sound of rock 'n' roll"" but likened their relationship to ""a bad marriage"". ""The problem I have with Phil is that he wanted to control Darlene Love's talent,""she told Variety,external. ""If he couldn't do that, he was going to do everything in his power to keep my talent from shining."" Weeks before Lana Clarkson was shot dead, Spector gave a rare interview to British broadsheet The Telegraph. ""I would say I'm probably relatively insane, to an extent,"" he told the paper, adding that he had ""devils inside that fight me"". Responding to news of the producer's death, Blondie guitarist Chris Stein tweeted: ""When we went to Phil Spector's house in the 70s he came to the door holding a bottle of diet Manischewitz wine in one hand and a presumably loaded 45 automatic in the other.

"There are warnings more children could be plunged into poverty A decision on whether the Â£20 weekly rise in Universal Credit will be kept in place is unlikely before March's Budget, a top minister has indicated. Campaigners say the uplift, worth more than Â£1,000 a year, has been a lifeline for the vulnerable during the pandemic. Labour will use a Commons debate on Monday to add pressure on ministers to agree now to extend it beyond 31 March. But Dominic Raab told the BBC it was a ""temporary measure"" and the Budget would spell out support ""in the round"". In an interview with Andrew Marr, the foreign secretary confirmed that Conservative MPs would be told to abstain in Monday's debate, meaning Labour's ""opposition day"" motion will be approved. While the motion will not be binding on ministers and won't change policy, the BBC's Ben Wright said not opposing it represented an attempt by the government to ""neutralise"" the issue for the time being. It showed, he added, how concerned ministers were about the prospect of a rebellion by Tory MPs - many of whom want an end to the uncertainty over the issue - if they had been asked to vote against it. Ministers urged to extend lockdown benefit 'boost' Families 'face period of destitution' during Covid The standard Universal Credit allowance, which is claimed by more than 5.5 million households, was increased by Â£20 a week in April 2020 as part of Chancellor Rishi Sunak's early Covid economic response. While it was designed as a temporary response to help those unable to work or struggling due to the lockdown, opposition parties and charities say failing to extend will cause real hardship for hundreds of thousands of people. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation has suggested about 16 million people will be directly affected, with millions of households facing an income loss equivalent to Â£1,040 a year. The organisation has warned 500,000 more people will be driven into poverty, including 200,000 children, while a further 500,000 of those already in poverty will find themselves in even worse hardship. Its director Helen Barnard said a decision could not be delayed any longer. ""The chancellor has said the economy is going to get worse before it gets better and our evidence shows it is those with the least who are often suffering the most,"" she said. ""No one can seriously argue that cutting support for those on the lowest incomes in April will do anything other than weaken our already fragile economy."" Asked whether the government should act now, Mr Raab said Monday's debate was a ""political"" move by the opposition and not about the government's overall financial support during the pandemic. He promised to ""look at everything in the round"" to make sure support for the most vulnerable was available. ""Obviously in March there will be a Budget where again that holistic approach can be taken by the chancellor, but we've put that support in place to make sure that the most vulnerable communities can be protected at this very difficult time,"" he told Andrew Marr. The government says it has injected an extra Â£7bn into the welfare system during the pandemic, including boosting Working Tax Credits by more than Â£1,000 a year for a 12-month period. Labour has urged the government to ""see sense"" on Universal Credit, saying that it would be both morally and economically wrong to ""take Â£1,000 a year from Britain's families"" at the peak of the unemployment crisis.

"This video can not be played The boss of NHS England reveals Covid-19 jabs are being done much faster than people are newly catching the virus People in England are being vaccinated four times faster than new cases of the virus are being detected, NHS England's chief executive has said. Sir Simon Stevens told the BBC that 140 people a minute were now being given the jab, usually the first dose of two. But he said the NHS had never been in a more precarious position, with 75% more Covid patients than at the April peak. It comes as a further 298,087 people received their first dose of the vaccine on Saturday. There were also 671 more deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test, and another 38,598 positive tests. Sir Simon told the Andrew Marr Show some hospitals would open for vaccinations 24 hours a day, seven days a week on a trial basis in the next 10 days. He said England was on course to deliver 1.5 million doses this week. Scotland has delivered a total of more than 224,000 first doses, Wales has given over 126,000 and Northern Ireland nearly 118,000 - although Scotland and Wales do not report figures at the weekend. Half of all over-80s have now been vaccinated,Health Secretary Matt Hancock said,external. ""Each jab brings us one step closer to normal,"" he said. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told the BBC that the UK was making ""good progress"" in ensuring every adult was offered a vaccine by September and ""if it can be done more swiftly, that's a bonus"". When, where and how will I get my Covid vaccine? 'Patchy supply' in Scotland hampering vaccine rollout NHS in Wales given 'as many vaccines as it can cope with' How worrying are the new coronavirus variants? More people have now been vaccinated than have had positive tests since the pandemic began, with10 more mass vaccination sitesdue to open in England on Monday. Sir Simon said hospitals and staff were under ""extreme pressure"", however. Asked if the NHS has ever been in a more precarious situation, he said ""no"", adding that the pandemic was a ""unique event"" in its 72-year history. Someone was being admitted to hospital with coronavirus every 30 seconds, Sir Simon said, and since Christmas patient numbers had risen by 15,000 - the equivalent of 30 full hospitals. It means there are 75% more Covid-19 patients in hospital than there were in the April peak, the NHS chief executive said. Although there were promising signs infection rates were falling, he said they were still too high and rising in some areas and age groups, including the over-60s. He said the number of critical care beds had been increased by 50% since the first wave of the pandemic but a ""very small number"" of patients were still having to be transferred between regions when hospitals were full. This video can not be played The foreign secretary said there would be increased UK border checks next week Asked about the ratio of nurses to patients in London intensive care units, Sir Simon said there were sometimes three patients for every nurse rather than the one-to-one ratio normally expected. But patients were receiving the ""highest quality care possible"". About 53,000 NHS staff are currently off work due to the virus, he added. Sir Simon said the health service would only be able to maintain the vaccination rate and ""hold the line if people continue to do the right thing and prevent the transmission of coronavirus"". Vaccinating priority groups by the spring would not mean that ""with one bound we are free"" of coronavirus restrictions, he said. But he added: ""I don't think we will have to wait until the autumn."" He said he suspected that there would be enough supply of the vaccine - ""the crucial thing"" - to begin lifting restrictions before then. Sir Simon also warned that although starting with the most vulnerable groups reduced the risk of deaths, a quarter of hospital patients with the virus were currently under 55 - and therefore not a priority unless they have a medical condition that puts them at additional risk. Asked about suggestions that some vaccination centres were having to throw away leftover doses, he said: ""The guidance from the chief medical officer is crystal clear: every last drop of vaccine should be used."" Many centres were finding they were able to get six doses out of a five-dose vial, and Sir Simon said they should keep a reserve list of staff and high-risk patients who could be contacted to receive a vaccination at short notice. Dr Rosie Shire from the Doctors' Association UK told the BBC that as well as sometimes getting six doses out of the five-dose Pfizer vials, they had also got 11 or 12 doses out of 10-dose AstraZeneca vials. But she said the uncertain dose count made it harder to know how many last-minute appointments to book in order to use up the supply. Mr Raab said that he was not aware of any delays to supplies from manufacturers Pfizer and AstraZeneca and said he was ""confident we have the flexibility"" to deliver enough doses. ""It is an enormous challenge. We are meeting it,"" he said. ""But we take nothing for granted."" The foreign secretary said the risk that new variants could prove resistant to vaccines or more deadly meant the UK had to take the ""precautionary approach"" of requiring all travellers to quarantine on arrival from Monday, closing the travel corridors which previously been exempt. ""We don't want to find in two or three weeks time that our vaccine roll out is imperilled because we haven't taken the precautionary measures on travel corridors,"" he said. Checks by Border Force on the passenger locator forms filled out on arrival would be increased, Mr Raab said, as would the follow-up calls by Public Health England intended to ensure people were isolating for up to 10 days. Asked whether the UK would introduce quarantine hotels to ensure people maintained their isolation, he said all potential measures were under review but there was a challenge in the ""workability"" of the proposal.

"This video can not be played The prime minister warns that ""we're not out of the woods yet"" People in England in their 70s, and those listed asclinically extremely vulnerable,external, will begin receiving offers of a coronavirus vaccine this week. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the move was a ""significant milestone"" in the nation's vaccination programme. More than five million people - from priority groups three and four - will be invited from Monday to have the jab. It comes as 10 further massvaccination hubs open across England. Speaking from a vaccination centre in Oxford, Mr Johnson said about four million people had received a vaccine so far, adding it was now ""right"" to offer the jab to other priority groups. He said: ""We're getting it out as fast as we can, four million done so far, I think we've done more than half of the over-80s, half of the people in care homes, the elderly residents of care homes."" He warned there would be no ""Open Sesame"" relaxation of Covid restrictions, adding that any easing was reliant on the vaccine rollout being a success and there being no further concerning variants of the virus. He said the pace of the rollout was ""very encouraging"" but cautioned that any easing of the rules would be ""gradual"", as the situation was ""still pretty precarious"". Health Secretary Matt Hancock will lead a Downing Street news briefing later, No 10 has said. When will you be eligible for the Covid vaccine? What are the new rules for travellers? How many cases are there in your area? The expansion of the vaccination programme comes after the number of people to receive a first dose rose to 3.8 million across the UK - more than have tested positive (3.4 million) since the pandemic began. However, people in the top two groups - care home residents, those aged 80 and over, and front-line healthcare workers - should still be prioritised for vaccinations, the Department for Health and Social Care said. People in their 70s -some 5.6 million people- and clinically extremely vulnerable individuals make uppriority groups three and four. Nadhim Zahawi, the minister responsible for the vaccine rollout, defended the decision to offer Covid jabs to the over-70s and clinically vulnerable - before all those in the first two priority groups have had their vaccinations. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the over-80s ""need not worry"" if they had not yet been invited for a jab. He said as it was only areas where the majority of the over-80s had been vaccinated that people aged 70 and over were being invited for jabs. He added that, by today, 50% of care home residents should have been vaccinated. Although vaccine supply remained ""lumpy"", he said he was ""confident"" the government would meet its target to vaccinate all 15 million people in the top four priority groups by 15 February. Visiting the NHS Covid Vaccine Centre in Wembley, north London, Prof Stephen Powis said there were signs in the capital that growth and infection rates were slowing Meanwhile, Prof Stephen Powis, national medical director for NHS England, said the NHS had never been under the level of pressure it is now, in any previous winter. Prof Powis told BBC Breakfast: ""I don't think the NHS has ever been under such pressure in any winter, but our staff are responding magnificently."" He added that there were ""signs"" in London that growth and infection rates were ""slowing"" but it would take ""several weeks"" before it had an impact in reducing the number of people in hospital, warning that it would be ""tough"" over the next couple of weeks. LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area FOOD:Is it safe to have a takeaway or shopping delivery? QUARANTINE:What are the new UK travel rules? TREATMENT:How close are we to helping people? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? Dr Rupert Pearse, a consultant in Intensive Care Medicine at a London Hospital, said although it appeared that infection levels had peaked in the capital, cases were still rising elsewhere in England, including the North West and Yorkshire, adding there was ""still cause to be concerned"". He told BBC Radio 4's World At One that hospital admissions tended to ""lag seven to 10 days behind the peak in infections"", with intensive care admissions coming 48 hours after that. He said that hospitals that are very close to the maximum number of beds they can give to Covid patients were ""still very worried about what will happen in the coming days"". This video can not be played BBC's Laura Foster explains the order in which the Covid vaccine will be given Dr Sarah Burford, a GP in Wellington, Somerset, who has been helping lead vaccine rollout in her region, said it was going ""terribly well"" but that ""a few"" patients had turned up out of the blue looking for a jab. She told BBC Radio 4's World At One programme that her four vaccinators were each giving a jab every seven-and-a-half minutes. Dr Burford added the over-80s and frontline healthcare workers were being invited for jabs, and her team's ""priority"" for this week and next would be vaccinating care home residents and staff. She said although most people were being patient, fielding calls or walk-in inquiries about when people could expect to be vaccinated was only delaying staff from administering jabs. Bournemouth International Centre, Dorset Taunton Racecourse, Somerset Blackburn Cathedral, Lancashire Salt Hill Activity Centre, Berkshire Norwich Food Court, Norfolk The Lodge in Wickford, Essex Princess Royal Sports Arena, Boston, Lincolnshire St Helens Rugby Ground, Merseyside The park-and-ride at Askham Bar, York Olympic Office Centre in Wembley, north London The seven hubs already in use are in:Etihad Tennis Centre, Manchester; Epsom Downs Racecourse, Surrey; Robertson House, Stevenage; Centre for Life, Newcastle; Ashton Gate Stadium, Bristol; Millennium Point, Birmingham; ExCel, London. Meanwhile, Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford hasdefended the speed of the vaccine rollout in Wales, insisting the nation was ""on track"" to vaccinate all top four priority groups by mid-February. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Wales's supply of the Pfizer jab is not being used all at once as it has to last until a delivery in February. In Wales, 151,737 people have received a first dose of a Covid vaccine, according to Public Health Wales, and  in Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced that264,991 people have had a first dose of the jab, with 80% of care home residents having now been vaccinated. This video can not be played The boss of NHS England reveals Covid-19 jabs are being done much faster than people are newly catching the virus While the prime minster said the UK is making ""huge progress in our fight against the virus"", he also expressed concern about that progress being derailed by new - currently unknown - variants of the virus. As such, he announced on Friday that, from this week, all travel corridors are to be closed. That means that anyone arriving in the UK - with onlya small number of exceptions,external- will have to quarantine. Under current rules, anyone flying into the country from overseas also has to show proof of a negative Covid test before setting off.

"Fully vaccinated people travelling to the UK no longer have to take any Covid tests - either before departure or on arrival. The prime minister has announced thathe intends to remove England's remaining Covid restrictions at the end of the month. Fully vaccinated travellers (two doses) and under-18s no longer need to take a test either before or after they arrive in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. To qualify as vaccinated, non-UK travellers must have received their jabs in a country or territory with""approved proof of vaccination"".,externalThis now covers most countries in the world, with more - including China - due to join on 11 February. Will travel return to normal this summer? What Covid rules remain across the UK? Unvaccinated travellers still have to show proof of a negative Covid test taken two days before departure. They must also take a post-arrival PCR test two days after arrival. This must be booked before travelling to the UK and bought privately froma government-approved list of providers.,external If this is positive, they need toself-isolate. However, unvaccinated travellers no longer have to self-isolate on arrival, or take a test on day eight.

"This video can not be played Expertâs report finds eight-year-old Saffie âcould have been savedâ if treated properly for her injuries The youngest victim of the Manchester Arena attack might have survived if she had received better first aid, a report commissioned by her family suggests. Eight-year-old Saffie-Rose Roussos died as a result of losing too much blood from injuries to her legs. It has emerged that no-one used simple tourniquets or splints to apply pressure and reduce the bleeding. Previously, experts commissioned by the Manchester Arena Inquiry found that Saffie's injuries were not survivable. This new information has come to light because lawyers representing the Roussos family commissioned different experts to look into the circumstances of her death. They believe that Saffie might have survived. For the past three years, Saffie's parents have believed that she was killed instantly in the explosion. They say they drew comfort from thinking that she had not suffered. Now they have been told that their daughter lived for over an hour, and that opportunities were missed to help her. Manchester attack: The victims The road to the Manchester Arena bombing The family has also discovered that Saffie asked a paramedic, ""am I going to die?"" as she was being taken to hospital by ambulance. Saffie's father, Andrew Roussos, told the BBC: ""She could have been saved."" He added: ""How do we carry on living with this information? How can we carry on breathing with this information? ""I can't look at Saffie's picture. Since I've read this report, I can't look at her."" Lisa and Andrew Roussos have launched a charity to help families affected by terror attacks The new report is based on evidence that includes witness statements, as well as CCTV footage and body-worn cameras from the emergency services. Previously, the family thought that Saffie died on the floor of the Manchester Arena foyer, where the bomb exploded on 22 May 2017. Now they have learned that she was not knocked unconscious. The report has found that, moments after the blast, Saffie lifted her head and tried to push herself up with her arms. She is said to have been given water, and to have asked for her mum. Several people tried to help Saffie but though she was bleeding heavily from serious leg injuries, nobody used a tourniquet, or splint to apply pressure and reduce the bleeding. Saffie was lifted on to an advertising hoarding and some railings, which were used as a makeshift stretcher. She was the first person to be carried out of the foyer, but there was no ambulance outside, and one had to be flagged down. The report commends the actions of the people who tried to get her to hospital as quickly as possible. But it has found that the ambulance did not have all the necessary equipment on board. Distressing detail has emerged about Saffie's time inside the ambulance. She is said to have been agitated, and pulling at her oxygen mask. She was able to speak and asked whether she was going to die. Mr Roussos says: ""Medically trained people were with her. And she was asking for help. She knew what was happening. And she bled to death. ""Eight year olds don't ask those questions. Doesn't matter how hurt they are, they want their mum. They want to be treated, they want to be out of pain.  Not to be in the sound mind to ask the paramedic whether she's going to die."" The report has found that the ambulance crew did not use tourniquets or splints on Saffie's injuries, and neither did the medical team at hospital, when Saffie arrived at A&E. It also says that it is unclear why the trauma team at the hospital didn't begin a surgical procedure called a ""thoracotomy"" to stop the bleeding. Saffie's idol was Ariana Grande Saffie was pronounced dead at the hospital at 11.40pm, more than an hour after the attack. The report says that because the bleeding was left unchecked, it resulted in a critical level of blood loss to the point at which the heart was no longer able to beat, and it could not be restarted. Mr Roussos says: ""Our medical experts have suggested that there were procedures that Saffie could have had and she didn't. She was losing that much blood. And there wasn't a successful procedure in place to get that blood into Saffie - even in A&E. Why?"" The Roussos family say that they cannot understand why two sets of experts have reached different opinions about Saffie's survivability. The Manchester Arena Inquiry is about to begin its phase of hearing evidence about the emergency response to the attack, in which 22 people died when a suicide bomb exploded. In the months ahead, Saffie's parents will hear evidence from the people who were with their daughter in her last moments. They have told the BBC that they want the public inquiry to get to the full truth about what happened to their little girl. Manchester bomber's brother jailed for 55 years What is the Manchester Arena Inquiry? Saffie, from Leyland, Lancashire, was at an Ariana Grande concert with her mother, Lisa, and sister, Ashlee Bromwich, when Salman Abedi detonated a bomb in a large foyer filling with people after it ended on 22 May 2017. The inquiry is looking at whether the attack could have been prevented, what happened on that night, the security arrangements around the arena, the emergency response to the bombing and the radicalisation of bomber Abedi. Last year the inquiry, which began in September, heard how each of the 22 individual victims died as well as personal evidence about them from their families.

"UN peacekeepers ended their mission in Darfur last month The number of people killed in clashes between different ethnic groups in Sudan's West Darfur state has risen to 83, a medical body has said. The fighting in the state capital, El Geneina, began on Saturday after a row in which a man was stabbed to death. A state-wide curfew has been imposed and Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok has sent a delegation to investigate. A conflict in Darfur that began in 2003 forced millions to flee and, despite a peace process, tensions remain. Saturday's violence comes less than three weeks after peacekeepers from the United Nations and African Union handed over security to the Khartoum authorities after 13 years there, reports the BBC's Youssef Taha. Why this 14-year-old boy has never seen his 'home' Similar clashes in El Geneina last year, which saw Arab pastoralists fight with non-Arab groups, caused hundreds of casualties. The most recent fighting was centred around a camp for people who had been displaced by the Darfur conflict. A deadly row between two men escalated into a fight involving armed militias, the AFP news agency reports. The Central Committee of Sudan Doctors said the death toll had risen from 48 to 83, and the number of wounded from around 100 to 160. Members of the armed forces were among the victims, it said. Casualties were likely to rise further as fighting was continuing, the medical body added. The government said on Sunday that troop reinforcements would be sent to the area The announcement was made after army chief Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan met top security officials to discuss the violence. A peace deal involving most, but not all, groups in Darfur was signed last year. The Darfur conflict began under the presidency of Omar al-Bashir, who was overthrown in 2019 and is wanted by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for alleged war crimes and genocide in the region. Justice for the people of Darfur was a key rallying cry for civilian groups who backed the ouster of the president after nearly three decades in power. The Sudanese Professionals' Association, which was at the forefront of the anti-Bashir movement, called for the current transitional government to deal with the ""unruly armed groups which have been freely moving and terrorising civilians since the collapse of the former regime"", Sudan's news agency reports.

"Wales has received about 250,000 doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and 50,000 doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine so far The NHS is being supplied with as many Covid-19 vaccines as it can cope with, according to a leading doctor. Dr Gill Richardson, chair of Wales' vaccination board, said health boards were receiving doses they asked for. On Friday, First Minister Mark Drakeford said the supply of the Pfizer vaccine was being ""spaced out"" as it had to last until a delivery in February. But opposition parties questioned why supplies were being ""spread out"". Paul Davies, leader of the Conservatives in the Senedd, said it was ""important now to get those vaccines out to people"". Plaid's health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth added it made ""little sense"" to spread out the vaccines, when ""time is of the essence"". When, where and how will I get my Covid vaccine? Q&A: When will I get my Covid-19 vaccine? All over-50s in Wales to be offered jab by spring But a Welsh Government minister defended the rollout and said the vaccine infrastructure is ""growing"". ""We're moving from a situation where we were using 50% of the stock for first vaccine to a situation where we are now using 100%,"" Counsel General Jeremy Milestold the BBC's Politics Wales show. ""In order to deliver that, the infrastructure for vaccinating needs to be increased and that infrastructure is being brought forward."" This video can not be played How will I get my Covid-19 vaccine in Wales? The Tories have called on the Welsh Government toappoint a vaccination ministerlike Prime Minister Boris Johnson has done in England. ""It would make a huge difference because this minister would be able to focus on the vaccination programme and nothing else,"" said Mr Davies. Wales was expected to receive 100,000 doses of the second vaccine - theOxford-AstraZeneca jab- this week but about a quarterare delayed after failing the regulator's tests. Dr Richardson said deliveries of the vaccines have arrived in ""pulses"" and a big consignment of the Pfizer vaccine - around 170,000 doses - arrived in late December. Half the vaccine was initially held back for booster jabs, but they are now being given to people as a first jab in a bid to get as many people vaccinated - and given some protection - as possible. Dr Richardson said they were only giving health boards what they could cope with as, after coming out of deep-freeze storage, the Pfizer jab has to be used within five days. ""We are very conscious that we need to get this out there,"" she told BBC Radio Wales'Sunday Supplement. Two full doses of the Oxford vaccine gave 62% protection, a half dose followed by a full dose was 90% and overall the trial showed 70% protection. ""I know that my colleagues are desperate to immunise our vulnerable people. ""We are now able and have been pushing all the vaccine that our health boards can cope with out to them."" There has been criticism that the rollout of the vaccine has been slower in Wales than in other parts of the UK. Wales has received about 250,000 doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and 50,000 doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine so far. The Welsh Government released a map showing the locations of the mass vaccination centres The Welsh Government said it had been assured it would get more Pfizer vaccines by February, despite shipments of it being temporarily slowed because of changes to the company's manufacturing processes. Dr Richardson said: ""We are going to have a famine, if you like, of Pfizer deliveries at the end of the month. ""That hasn't stopped us pushing out as much vaccine as we can to the health boards. ""But their clinics will run out of the Pfizer vaccine if more does not come."" The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine can be given at GP surgeries The Welsh Government saidone Oxford-AstraZeneca batch out of four had been delayed, affecting 26,000 doses due to be sent to Wales' seven health boards. Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board, which manages the health service in north Wales, said it hadadvised GPs""may wish to delay appointments early next week"" with the planned supply reduced. BBC Wales has contacted the other health boards in Wales to ask if vaccination appointments have been affected, but they have not given details. Dr Richardson said while it was ""a huge issue for this week, it won't be an issue overall for the programme, we are hoping, because we have been reassured by the UK government that supplies (of the Oxford vaccine) are on their way"". Any GPs affected will be prioritised for the next batch of vaccine, she said. Asked if he could guarantee supplies to Wales, Welsh Secretary Simon Hart told the programme: ""Yes, I think I can."" He added: ""There will be the odd occasion when a consignment is rejected or delayed. Nobody should panic about that.""

"This video can not be played How will I get my Covid-19 vaccine in Wales? Have you been wondering when you will get your coronavirus vaccine, where you will have it and what to expect? Public Health Wales figures showmore than 630,000 people in Walesso far have had their first jab so far - but when will it be your turn? The Welsh Government'svaccine strategy,externalsays everyone will be offered a jab by autumn. Some have said people with mobility issues will find it tough to travel to mass-vaccination centres. Pharmacy 'first in Wales to offer Covid jab' Q&A: When will I get my Covid-19 vaccine? All over-50s in Wales to be offered jab by spring Here is a run down of everything you need to know. The NHS is vaccinating people in order of clinical risk, largely based on age groups from old to young. The Welsh Government said its plans were dependent on Wales receiving vaccine supplies ""in fair proportions and in fair time"". People are asked not to contact their health board, GP, pharmacists or local authority for an appointment and youwill be informed by letter,externalabout how the process will work in your area. When, where and how will I get my Covid vaccine? People will receive a letter, phone call, email or text  from their health board with details of the location where they will receive the vaccination. Invitations will be generated automatically and sent when people are due their vaccination. As the rollout ramps up, vaccines in Wales will be given in mass vaccination centres, GP surgeries, mobile units - and on Friday, thefirst pharmacy in Wales gave the Covid jabas community trials began. The Welsh Government released a map showing the locations of the mass vaccination centres There will be 35 mass vaccination centres across Wales but to ensure people - especially the elderly and those with mobility issues - can be inoculated in their community, about250 GP practices across the country,externalwill be able to administer the jab by the end of January. Most people will get their vaccine in a primary care setting - so at a GP surgery, pharmacy, optometrist or dentist, the Welsh Government has said. Vulnerable or at-risk people in high priority groups have been offered the vaccine at the earliest possible opportunity - which might be at one of Wales' mass-vaccination centres. Due to Wales' rural geography, that could mean elderly or people with mobility issues being asked to travel many miles for a jab. Fay Hopkins faces a round-trip of almost 90 minutes to get her jab Fay Hopkins, 88, who lives in Abercrave, Powys, has an appointment for a vaccine in Bronllys Hospital, one of the three vaccination centres in Powys - a 62-mile round trip from her home. Her daughter Cathy Anthony said her ""vulnerable"" mother had ""no choice"" but to make the trip. Powys health board said the vaccination centres offered the ""quickest opportunity to receive their first dose of the vaccine"". On Wednesday, the health board announced that all 16 GP practices across Powys would start to call people aged75-80 to book Covid vaccination appointments,external. Ms Anthony said: ""I really don't understand why if the community nurses can go into care homes, why can't they go into her home?"" The retired nurse said she has not seen her mother, who lives alone, for months as they have both been shielding since March. ""My mother is not very good at travelling because she gets motion sickness so it is not good for her anyway. She has no choice - she is going to have to otherwise she will miss out. ""My mother is lucky that my brother is well and can take her. I have MS and I am undergoing chemotherapy and my other brother has long Covid. What about people who have no-one?"" Powys health board said: ""We wanted to get invitations out to these priority groups as quickly as possible (all letters to over 80s will have been posted) to give them the earliest opportunity to access the vaccine. ""We do very much recognise the challenges of travel in such a rural county - as well as the understandable desire to receive the vaccine as quickly as possible. ""This has meant a complex balance between providing as much vaccine as quickly as possible and local access."" If you are offered a vaccine at a mass vaccination and can't get there, call the number on your invite to cancel and wait for a second invite for a jab closer to home. Those who are housebound and in care homes should be able to receive the vaccine from mobile vaccination units. Betsi Cadwaladr's health board has to apologise afterqueues of up to three hourswere reported at the vaccination centre at Ysbyty Enfys in Llandudno. Queues formed outside the vaccination centre in Llandudno in Conwy county last week But the Welsh Government said by ""using an appointment system, we hope to minimise queuing at vaccination centres."" There are currently two approved vaccines being administered in Wales - thePfizer-BioNTechvaccine and theOxford-AstraZenecavaccine. Two full doses of the Oxford vaccine gave 62% protection, a half dose followed by a full dose was 90% and overall the trial showed 70% protection. A third coronavirus vaccine has been approved for use in the UK - made by US company Moderna - butsupplies are not expected to arrive until spring. The Pfizer vaccine has to be kept at -70C, but the Oxford jab can be stored at standard fridge temperatures, and can be administered in doctors' surgeries, pharmacies and care homes. Experts have concluded that both vaccines are very effective, and have not stipulated a preference for either one in any specific population. Public Health Wales said everyone will be offered a vaccine that has been approved by the MHRA as safe and effective and recommended by the Joint Committee for Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) for people of their age or risk group. Public Health Wales said:""Please try to attend the vaccination centre you are offered,external. If you cannot attend the centre you are offered you may have to wait to get the vaccine in a more convenient location."" You will need to bring a face covering, unless you cannot wear one for a health or disability reason, and your booking reference number if your appointment is at a vaccination centre. If you need a carer you can bring them with you on the day. Your appointment should last for about 30 to 45 minutes. You will be asked some questions about your medical history. The vaccine will then begiven as an injection into your upper arm.,external You will be asked to wait for 15 minutes after having the jab.  This is in the unlikely event you have a serious reaction to the vaccine. You will also be given a leaflet about what to expect after your vaccination. Public Health Wales has said the vaccines are very safe but as with all medicines,side effects can occur.,external It said most side effects of are mild and short-term, and not everyone gets them. They can include pain at the injection site, feeling tired, a headache, or mild muscle aches. This video can not be played Laura Foster explains why the Oxford vaccine matters A less common side effect is swelling of glands, which can occur a few days after the injection, and is a sign the immune system is responding to the vaccination. Anaphylaxis can happen after vaccines or medicines but the vast majority of people will not be at risk. Health professionals are trained to watch out for the early signs and initiate prompt treatment - all immunisation centres include anaphylaxis kits. Public Health Wales says the benefits of preventing the serious complications of Covid for most people outweigh the risks. You will be asked if you have ever had any serious allergic reactions before you are offered vaccination. The vaccine is not mandatory and you can choose to take up the offer of a vaccine or not. As of Monday, theCardiff and Valehealth board said it had vaccinated more than 24,000 people, including nearly 19,000 health, social care and care home staff, nearly 600 care home residents and nearly 3,000 other people aged over 80. Cwm Taf Morgannwghealth board in south Wales said it had vaccinated nearly 17,000 people as of Friday, and aimed to give all 100,000 people in the top priority groups at least a first dose by mid-February. TheHywel Ddahealth board serving west Wales said on Monday it had given more than 18,000 vaccinations, including jabs to 42% of healthcare workers, 38% of care home staff, 25% of care home residents and just under 9% of people over 80. Powys Teaching health boardsaid letters should arrive by Tuesday to everyone aged over 80 inviting them to get a vaccination, with more than 7,000 people in the priority groups having received their first dose. TheSwansea Bayboard said it was ""on target"" to vaccinate all care home residents with a first dose by the end of January and that all over-80s would be offered a vaccine ""over the coming weeks"" In north Wales, theBetsi Cadwaladrboard said it aimed to vaccinate 90% of the priority groups by the end of January.

"This video can not be played Alexei Navalny is led away after arriving back in Moscow from Germany Putin critic Alexei Navalny has been detained after flying back to Moscow from Germany, five months after he was nearly killed by a nerve agent attack. The activist, 44, was led away by police at passport control at Sheremetyevo airport. Thousands had gathered at a different Moscow airport to greet his flight from Berlin, but the plane was diverted. Mr Navalny blames Russian authorities for the attempt on his life last year. The Kremlin denies any role. The opposition politician's allegations have however been backed up by reports from investigative journalists. News of Mr Navalny's detention prompted condemnation from the European Union, France and Italy, which called for his immediate release. US President-elect Joe Biden's incoming national security adviser echoed the call. ""The Kremlin's attacks on Mr Navalny are not just a violation of human rights, but an affront to the Russian people who want their voices heard,"" Jake Sullivan said. When Mr Navalny was poisoned last August and collapsed on an internal flight in Siberia, he was flown to Germany for emergency medical treatment. As he recovered, he said he intended to return to Russia. On Sunday he made good on that pledge, boarding a Pobeda Airlines flight despite warnings he would face arrest on landing. The plane was packed with journalists, including Andrey Kozenko of the BBC Russian Service. Shortly before landing, the pilot announced that for ""technical reasons"", the plane was being diverted from Vnukovo airport to Sheremetyevo airport, causing a stir among the passengers. Alexei Navalny: Russia's vociferous Putin critic ""I know that I'm right. I fear nothing,"" Mr Navalny told supporters and the media upon landing, just minutes before he was detained. ""Have you been waiting for me long?"" he asked border guards. He kissed his wife Yulia - who had flown with him from Germany - after police officers warned they would use physical force if he disobeyed their orders to come with them. Despite pleas, Mr Navalny's lawyer was not allowed to accompany him. The activist is being held at a police station in Moscow. A number of Navalny supporters were detained at Moscow's Vnukovo airport Earlier on Sunday, extra riot police were deployed and metal barriers erected inside Vnukovo airport, where the plane was originally scheduled to land. Russian media reported that a number of activists - including key Navalny ally Lyubov Sobol - had been detained. In a statement late on Sunday, Russia's prison service said the opposition leader ""had been wanted since 29 December 2020 for repeated violations of the probation period"". It added that he would remain in custody until a court decision. The authorities accuse him of violating conditions imposed after a conviction for embezzlement, for which he received a suspended sentence. He has always said the case was politically motivated. Separately, Russian prosecutors have launched a new criminal case against Mr Navalny on fraud charges related to transfers of money to various charities, including his Anti-Corruption Foundation. The activist earlier argued that Mr Putin was doing all he could to stop him from returning to Russia by fabricating new cases against him. The Russian authorities often make out that Alexei Navalny isn't popular with the Russian people, that he's no threat to President Putin. But his return home five months after being poisoned sparked a major police operation on Sunday. In chaotic scenes, riot police pushed Mr Navalny's supporters out of the arrivals hall of Vnukovo airport, before the flight was rerouted. Last summer, Russia's most prominent opposition figure was attacked in Siberia allegedly by an undercover hit squad of Russian security agents. His decision to return home is a direct challenge to Vladimir Putin - and creates a dilemma for the Kremlin. It risks turning him into a political martyr, a Nelson Mandela-like figure, and sparking more Western sanctions. Do nothing and the Kremlin's fiercest critic will almost certainly be a thorn in its side in an important election year. In August, he collapsed on a plane flying from Tomsk in Siberia to Moscow. The pilot diverted the flight to the city of Omsk, where Mr Navalny was admitted to hospital. Two days later, Russian officials allowed him to be airlifted to Germany in an induced coma for specialised treatment. European experts later said he had been poisoned with the extremely toxic chemical weapon Novichok, developed by Soviet scientists in the Cold War. He was released from a hospital in Berlin in September to continue his recuperation. Two hours that saved Alexei Navalny's life Report names 'Russian agents' in Navalny poisoning Mr Navalny said recently he was able to do push-ups and squat exercises, and therefore had probably almost fully recovered. Last month, investigative reporters named three agents of Russia's FSB security service who had travelled to Tomsk at the time Mr Navalny was there, and said the specialist unit had tailed him for years. Alexei Navalny posed as a security official in the phone call with an FSB agent Mr Navalny then duped an FSB agent named Konstantin Kudryavtsev into revealing details of the operation against him in a phone conversation which he recorded and posted online. The agent told him that the Novichok used to poison him had been placed in his underpants. President Putin hasdismissed investigations by the Bellingcat website and other groupsthat have blamed Russian intelligence agents for the attack as ""a trick"". He has alleged his rival is backed by US intelligence services. This video can not be played Does Putin admit any responsibility for ""new Cold War""?

Under coronavirus rules people are only allowed to leave their homes for ""essential"" reasons, including to shop for food, get medical treatment and to exercise. While exercise is allowed, people are not allowed to drive to a spot for a walk, run or cycle, and the law means exercising with people you do not live with (or who are your bubble if you live alone) is banned. Those found to be in breach of Covid laws can be fined Â£60 for the first offence, with the penalties increasing up to Â£1,920. If prosecuted, however, a court can impose an unlimited fine.

"Chris Cramer, a major figure in BBC News and later CNN International, has died at the age of 73 after a period of ill health. Former BBC director of news Richard Sambrook looks back at his life. Chris Cramer's legacy will be the major change in attitudes and support for journalist safety he championed through the BBC and across the wider industry, as well as many achievements in newsgathering and international news. He began his career as a teenager on the Portsmouth Evening News, moving to BBC Radio Solent when it launched in 1970. After a year's secondment in Brunei he found his way to the BBC TV Newsroom in the 1970s and developed his reputation as a highly competitive and effective news editor and field producer. In 1980 he and a BBC team were in the Iranian Embassy in London collecting visas when it was seized by gunmen opposed to Ayatollah Khomeini. A standoff and siege followed, with Chris among 26 hostages. He managed to feign serious illness and was released by the gunmen allowing him to give vital information to the authorities before the SAS stormed the embassy and rescued the hostages. At a time when no-one understood or spoke of PTSD, it had a marked effect on his life. Armed police on the adjoining balcony to the Iranian Embassy during the siege in 1980 Many journalists and crew subsequently spoke of his care and attention when they had difficult experiences and he went on to drive major changes in understanding and support for journalists' safety. With BBC Safety manager Peter Hunter, Chris introduced the first hostile environment training courses, risk assessments and equipment for those covering conflicts. Former correspondent Martin Bell recalls: ""From Vietnam to Croatia I had covered 10 wars without protection. Then in June 1992 we were shot up crossing the airport runway in Sarajevo in a soft-skinned vehicle. Within two weeks Chris had procured our first armoured Land Rover, the redoubtable 'Miss Piggy', and the body armour to go with it."" He later introduced the first confidential counselling service for news teams, recognising PTSD, and helped found the International News Safety Institute, which spearheaded safety across the news industry. During the 1980s he was at the forefront of organising and overseeing major news coverage, including Michael Buerk's reporting from the Ethiopian famine, coverage of the IRA Brighton bomb attack on the British government, the Zeebrugge ferry disaster, Kate Adie's reporting from Tiananmen Square, the fall of eastern Europe, the first Gulf War and many more major events. His fierce competitiveness delivered a series of major exclusives and awards for BBC News. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In the 1990s he oversaw major investment in BBC Newsgathering and the integration of radio and TV reporting - often against internal resistance. His managerial style could be uncompromising and tough, but he was also bitingly funny, shrewd and his hard exterior hid a warm-hearted and generous core. He was crucial to establishing the integrated News division as it exists today. In 1996 he left the BBC to move to Atlanta as managing director and executive vice-president of CNN International. There he took his passion for news safety and his competitive news edge to develop the network into a greater global force. As his former BBC and CNN colleague Tony Maddox has said: ""Among his many accomplishments Chris was a pioneer and innovator in field safety for journalists. He led the development of guidelines and practices now widely adopted across the industry."" Cramer moved to CNN after his time with the BBC He was a larger-than-life figure who generated affection and respect in equal measure, often wielding a rapid and disarming wit. He is also remembered for supporting women into senior and executive positions and helping them succeed. Director of BBC News Fran Unsworth recalls: ""He was one of journalism's enormous characters and a legend in the television news industry. But the legend and the reported image always belied the man. ""He was immensely kind, thoughtful and caring underneath that image he sometimes projected."" Former deputy director general Mark Byford said: ""He was probably the greatest newsgathering executive ever in the broadcast news business and his organisational skills, competitiveness, eye for a story and steel were extraordinary. ""He was also, behind the facade, a gentle giant who cared for his people with amazing passion and love. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""Many editors, correspondents and presenters in BBC News owe their success to his mentorship - myself included."" After 11 years he left CNN and took up roles first with Reuters TV and then the Wall Street Journal, where his experience and expertise were used to develop their digital video services. He leaves his wife, Nina, son Richard and daughter Nicolette and his daughter Hannah by an earlier marriage to Helen, a former BBC producer.

Thanks for joining us. Our coronavirus live page will be back tomorrow morning. The live page writers today were: Victoria Lindrea, Kelly-Leigh Cooper and Alex Therrien. The page was edited by James Clarke. We will soon be bringing our coronavirus live page to a pause for the day. But before we do, here's a round-up of the main stories today.  By Giancarlo Rinaldi Pilot Douglas Jones, 27, was enjoying his dream job, working for Aegean
Airlines and living in Greece, when the pandemic began last spring - and borders began to close. Fearing being stranded in Greece, he booked a
flight home to Scotland and within a couple of weeks learned his job was gone. Back home, in the small Scottish town of Moffat,
in Dumfries and Galloway, he found himself âdesperate to do somethingâ. ""When you have been used to living in
Berlin and Athens and you move back to Moffat, living with your dad, it is a
bit of slowdown,"" he says. It was a relative of a friend who spotted south
of Scotland firm Alpha Solway was hiring new workers tomeet demand for personal protective equipment
(PPE). It certainly marked a change of pace â the nine-to-five office-based routine was difficult to adjust to for someone accustomed to
navigating the skies of Europe â but Douglas says he was  ""surprised""
by what parts of his old job he could bring to his new post. ""A lot in commercial aviation is about
awareness - situational awareness - and a lot of that can be built into
manufacturing as well,"" he says. While looking forward to returning to the skies one day, he adds: âI have learned a huge amount here. âThere are good people here doing a good job
and I am helping at least with that."" Read more. Children
in England will be able to access free books online during school closures. TheOak National Academy,externalis creating a virtual library,
after schools moved to remote learning for the majority of pupils until at
least February half-term. Formed
with The National Literacy Trust,the library will provide one free book each week,
from its author of the week. The first book to feature will be Dame Jacqueline Wilson's
The Story Of Tracy Beaker, which will be available for a week from today. ""Many children's literacy skills
were profoundly affected by the first lockdown and school closures,â said Jonathan
Douglas, chief executive of the National Literacy Trust. ""We will do everything in our power to
support children, families and teachers during this new lockdown period."" This video can not be played Covid-19: Running a roadside van when a pandemic cuts traffic Running a roadside van can give a whole new perspective on a national lockdown. In Wales, car journeys reduced by two-thirds during lockdown periods. ""We haven't seen any of our regular customers since the big lockdown back in March,"" says one business owner, languishing in a silent layby. Hours can go by without seeing a solitary vehicle. But the food vans have also provided a lifeline for hungry hauliers too - when shops and service stations are closed down - and drivers seek refreshment. ""With this pandemic, the money fluctuates - it's up and down - one day, you're rock-bottom, the next day you're flying high,"" says another owner. ""You can't plan anything."" And with the working environment likely to be very different post-pandemic, what future is there for these small businesses? A man told police he had driven from Luton to Devizes to visit a McDonald's, even though the town does not have a branch of the burger chain. Wiltshire Police pointed out he had driven across ""numerous counties"", called his actions a ""flagrant breach"" of lockdown regulations and fined the man Â£200. The 34-year-old was stopped on Estcourt Street in Devizes, a distance of more than 100 miles (160km) from Luton. ""The majority of people across Wiltshire continue to act responsibly and we thank you for that, however, it is important to protect the NHS that we all stick to the rules,"" said police. Up to a fifth of staff in some care home groups have refused a coronavirus vaccine when offered, the PA news agency has been told, with suggestions younger workers are more likely to be resistant. The majority of care home staff who have been offered the jab are getting vaccinated, but data obtained by PA from a number of providers shows between 5% and 21% of staff offered a vaccine have declined it. There is currently no regular data from the NHS or government on how many residents and staff have been given the vaccine, and how many have refused a jab. Care groups have been calling for daily figures so they can check if the government is on track to have offered vaccines to all residents by 24 January and address any take-up issues. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Friday that almost 40% of elderly residents have been vaccinated.  The Israel Prison Service said on Sunday that it will begin vaccinating all prisoners against Covid-19 amid a political row over a policy not to. Public Security Minister Amir Ohana had previously said prisoners in Israeli jails should not be inoculated yet until further notice - on the basis other groups should be prioritised first. The minister faced backlash after saying the vaccinations should only be given to staff, not inmates The order has faced criticism from human rights groups both inside and outside the country, as well as from senior figures such as Defence Minister Benny Gantz, the country's attorney general and the president. âPreventing life-saving medical treatment from people in prison - whether due to a sentence imposed on them by the court or due to detention prior to sentencing - is inconsistent with our values, the values ââof the state, Judaism, and democracy,â President Reuven Rivlin said Thursday. The prison service confirmation comes days after the Minister of Health said the rollout would start in prisons on Monday or Tuesday. Israel has vaccinated at least one vaccine to more than two million of its citizens so far - leading the race globally per capita. A group of London business leaders has written to the government calling for financial support for the struggling rail firm Eurostar. In a letter to the Treasury and Department for Transport, they urge ""swift action to safeguard its future"". Bosses of firms such as Fortnum & Mason signed the letter asking for access to government loans and business rates relief ""at the very least"". The government says it is ""working closely"" with Eurostar. The cross-Channel rail company is threatened by a large drop in passenger numbers due to coronavirus-related travel restrictions. It reported in November that passenger numbers had been down 95% since March 2020. Read more The government's daily figures also show the number of UK vaccinations is 3,857,266 up to and including 16 January. This is a 298,087 increase from yesterday's total of 3,559,179. A further 4,179 patients have been admitted to hospital - down from 4,262 on Saturday. A further 671 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test,according to the latest government figures,external. There were also 38,598 new cases. Yesterday there were 1,295 deaths and 41,346 cases. Concerns are being raised about employees forced to go into workplaces that are not Covid-compliant during lockdown. In just one week in January, the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) received 2,945 complaints about safety issues. The head of the UK's unions is calling for ministers to crack down on employers ""who break Covid safety rules"". ""If the government is upping enforcement, ministers should start with employers who break Covid safety rules,"" says TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady. O'Grady calls for an increase in resources for the HSE ""to stop rogue employers getting away with putting staff at risk"". ""Every employer needs to know an inspection could happen any time,"" she says. A spokeswoman for the HSE says its inspectors ""continue to be out and about, putting employers on the spot and checking that they are complying with health and safety law"". The HSE has carried out more than 32,300 site visits during the pandemic, and introduced telephone spot-checks in response to the coronavirus crisis, she says. Doctors' leaders say the ""patchy supply"" of vaccine to GP surgeries across Scotland is hampering the speed of delivery to patients. Ministers have pledged a first dose of the vaccine to1.4 million of the most vulnerableScots by mid-February. But the British Medical Association in Scotland says inconsistencies in supply make it difficult to plan patient appointments - and some GP surgeries have yet to receive any vaccine at all. Dr Andrew Buist, who chairs the British Medical Association's GP committee in Scotland, says so far ""good progress"" has been made in giving it to priority groups such as care home residents and front-line health staff. But he tells the BBC's Politics Scotland programme: ""The current problem lies with the next priority group, which is the 80-plus group, which GPs in Scotland are set to vaccinate because the supply of the vaccine so far has been quite patchy. ""Some practices have a good supply, some have had none so far."" He says his practice has received 100 doses of the vaccine for 600 patients over the age of 80, who all need to be vaccinated by 5 February. ""We don't want to send out appointments to patients until we know that we can definitively vaccinate them, otherwise patients get very upset."" Health Secretary Jeane Freeman has pledged the workforce and infrastructure will be in place to vaccinate 400,000 people each week by the end of February. Meanwhile no new Covid-related deaths have been reported in Scotland today and while 1,341 new cases of Covid-19 have been reported, that is the lowest daily figure since 28 December. Read more.

Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr Show this morning, Sir Simon Stevens also said he didn't think England ""would have to wait until the autumn"" to see movement over the lockdown restrictions. He added it would be a ""balance of risk"" and a judgement that government and policy makers would have to make. Hospitals in Northern Ireland are preparing for the expected peak of the latest Covid-19 surge this week, a health and social care trust chief has said. Jennifer Welsh, Northern Trust's chief executive, said there was ""huge pressure across the (healthcare) system"" with more intensive care admissions expected. Thirty patients were awaiting admission to Antrim Area Hospital on Sunday morning, she said. There are 840 patients being treated for Covid- 19 across Northern Ireland. Sixty-two of those patients are in intensive care and NI hospitals are working at 95% capacity, with some exceeding that, latest figures show. On Saturday,22 more Covid-19-related deaths were reported in Northern Ireland, bringing the total number of deaths recorded by the Department of Health since the start of the pandemic to 1,581.

Aviation minister Robert Courts says the move is a response to the closure of all UK air corridors from Monday. The aim is to provide grants by the end of this financial year, he says. Industry groups have warned there isonly so long airports can ""run on fumes"", following the announcement of the new quarantine rules. Underthe new rules beginning at 04:00 GMT on Monday,external, all travel corridors - which have been in place to allow arrivals from some countries to forgo quarantine - will close. All arrivals to the UK after that time will need to isolate for up to 10 days, although the quarantine period can be cut short with a negative test after five days. People will also have to show proof of a negative test taken in the previous 72 hours before travelling.

"This video can not be played Alexei Navalny is led away after arriving back in Moscow from Germany Putin critic Alexei Navalny has been detained after flying back to Moscow from Germany, five months after he was nearly killed by a nerve agent attack. The activist, 44, was led away by police at passport control at Sheremetyevo airport. Thousands had gathered at a different Moscow airport to greet his flight from Berlin, but the plane was diverted. Mr Navalny blames Russian authorities for the attempt on his life last year. The Kremlin denies any role. The opposition politician's allegations have however been backed up by reports from investigative journalists. News of Mr Navalny's detention prompted condemnation from the European Union, France and Italy, which called for his immediate release. US President-elect Joe Biden's incoming national security adviser echoed the call. ""The Kremlin's attacks on Mr Navalny are not just a violation of human rights, but an affront to the Russian people who want their voices heard,"" Jake Sullivan said. When Mr Navalny was poisoned last August and collapsed on an internal flight in Siberia, he was flown to Germany for emergency medical treatment. As he recovered, he said he intended to return to Russia. On Sunday he made good on that pledge, boarding a Pobeda Airlines flight despite warnings he would face arrest on landing. The plane was packed with journalists, including Andrey Kozenko of the BBC Russian Service. Shortly before landing, the pilot announced that for ""technical reasons"", the plane was being diverted from Vnukovo airport to Sheremetyevo airport, causing a stir among the passengers. Alexei Navalny: Russia's vociferous Putin critic ""I know that I'm right. I fear nothing,"" Mr Navalny told supporters and the media upon landing, just minutes before he was detained. ""Have you been waiting for me long?"" he asked border guards. He kissed his wife Yulia - who had flown with him from Germany - after police officers warned they would use physical force if he disobeyed their orders to come with them. Despite pleas, Mr Navalny's lawyer was not allowed to accompany him. The activist is being held at a police station in Moscow. A number of Navalny supporters were detained at Moscow's Vnukovo airport Earlier on Sunday, extra riot police were deployed and metal barriers erected inside Vnukovo airport, where the plane was originally scheduled to land. Russian media reported that a number of activists - including key Navalny ally Lyubov Sobol - had been detained. In a statement late on Sunday, Russia's prison service said the opposition leader ""had been wanted since 29 December 2020 for repeated violations of the probation period"". It added that he would remain in custody until a court decision. The authorities accuse him of violating conditions imposed after a conviction for embezzlement, for which he received a suspended sentence. He has always said the case was politically motivated. Separately, Russian prosecutors have launched a new criminal case against Mr Navalny on fraud charges related to transfers of money to various charities, including his Anti-Corruption Foundation. The activist earlier argued that Mr Putin was doing all he could to stop him from returning to Russia by fabricating new cases against him. The Russian authorities often make out that Alexei Navalny isn't popular with the Russian people, that he's no threat to President Putin. But his return home five months after being poisoned sparked a major police operation on Sunday. In chaotic scenes, riot police pushed Mr Navalny's supporters out of the arrivals hall of Vnukovo airport, before the flight was rerouted. Last summer, Russia's most prominent opposition figure was attacked in Siberia allegedly by an undercover hit squad of Russian security agents. His decision to return home is a direct challenge to Vladimir Putin - and creates a dilemma for the Kremlin. It risks turning him into a political martyr, a Nelson Mandela-like figure, and sparking more Western sanctions. Do nothing and the Kremlin's fiercest critic will almost certainly be a thorn in its side in an important election year. In August, he collapsed on a plane flying from Tomsk in Siberia to Moscow. The pilot diverted the flight to the city of Omsk, where Mr Navalny was admitted to hospital. Two days later, Russian officials allowed him to be airlifted to Germany in an induced coma for specialised treatment. European experts later said he had been poisoned with the extremely toxic chemical weapon Novichok, developed by Soviet scientists in the Cold War. He was released from a hospital in Berlin in September to continue his recuperation. Two hours that saved Alexei Navalny's life Report names 'Russian agents' in Navalny poisoning Mr Navalny said recently he was able to do push-ups and squat exercises, and therefore had probably almost fully recovered. Last month, investigative reporters named three agents of Russia's FSB security service who had travelled to Tomsk at the time Mr Navalny was there, and said the specialist unit had tailed him for years. Alexei Navalny posed as a security official in the phone call with an FSB agent Mr Navalny then duped an FSB agent named Konstantin Kudryavtsev into revealing details of the operation against him in a phone conversation which he recorded and posted online. The agent told him that the Novichok used to poison him had been placed in his underpants. President Putin hasdismissed investigations by the Bellingcat website and other groupsthat have blamed Russian intelligence agents for the attack as ""a trick"". He has alleged his rival is backed by US intelligence services. This video can not be played Does Putin admit any responsibility for ""new Cold War""?

"The assassinations are the latest in a string targeting women in high-profile jobs (file photo) Two women judges working for the Afghan Supreme Court have been shot dead. They were killed by unidentified gunmen on their way to work on Sunday. The deaths are the latest in a string of assassinations targeting journalists, activists and other political figures. The violence comes as President Donald Trump continues a drawdown of US troops in the country - with only 2,500 left. The Afghan vice-president told the BBC this week that the pull-out risks more violencein an unstable country. The women were shot dead in an early morning ambush, which also saw their driver wounded.

"Chris Cramer, a major figure in BBC News and later CNN International, has died at the age of 73 after a period of ill health. Former BBC director of news Richard Sambrook looks back at his life. Chris Cramer's legacy will be the major change in attitudes and support for journalist safety he championed through the BBC and across the wider industry, as well as many achievements in newsgathering and international news. He began his career as a teenager on the Portsmouth Evening News, moving to BBC Radio Solent when it launched in 1970. After a year's secondment in Brunei he found his way to the BBC TV Newsroom in the 1970s and developed his reputation as a highly competitive and effective news editor and field producer. In 1980 he and a BBC team were in the Iranian Embassy in London collecting visas when it was seized by gunmen opposed to Ayatollah Khomeini. A standoff and siege followed, with Chris among 26 hostages. He managed to feign serious illness and was released by the gunmen allowing him to give vital information to the authorities before the SAS stormed the embassy and rescued the hostages. At a time when no-one understood or spoke of PTSD, it had a marked effect on his life. Armed police on the adjoining balcony to the Iranian Embassy during the siege in 1980 Many journalists and crew subsequently spoke of his care and attention when they had difficult experiences and he went on to drive major changes in understanding and support for journalists' safety. With BBC Safety manager Peter Hunter, Chris introduced the first hostile environment training courses, risk assessments and equipment for those covering conflicts. Former correspondent Martin Bell recalls: ""From Vietnam to Croatia I had covered 10 wars without protection. Then in June 1992 we were shot up crossing the airport runway in Sarajevo in a soft-skinned vehicle. Within two weeks Chris had procured our first armoured Land Rover, the redoubtable 'Miss Piggy', and the body armour to go with it."" He later introduced the first confidential counselling service for news teams, recognising PTSD, and helped found the International News Safety Institute, which spearheaded safety across the news industry. During the 1980s he was at the forefront of organising and overseeing major news coverage, including Michael Buerk's reporting from the Ethiopian famine, coverage of the IRA Brighton bomb attack on the British government, the Zeebrugge ferry disaster, Kate Adie's reporting from Tiananmen Square, the fall of eastern Europe, the first Gulf War and many more major events. His fierce competitiveness delivered a series of major exclusives and awards for BBC News. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In the 1990s he oversaw major investment in BBC Newsgathering and the integration of radio and TV reporting - often against internal resistance. His managerial style could be uncompromising and tough, but he was also bitingly funny, shrewd and his hard exterior hid a warm-hearted and generous core. He was crucial to establishing the integrated News division as it exists today. In 1996 he left the BBC to move to Atlanta as managing director and executive vice-president of CNN International. There he took his passion for news safety and his competitive news edge to develop the network into a greater global force. As his former BBC and CNN colleague Tony Maddox has said: ""Among his many accomplishments Chris was a pioneer and innovator in field safety for journalists. He led the development of guidelines and practices now widely adopted across the industry."" Cramer moved to CNN after his time with the BBC He was a larger-than-life figure who generated affection and respect in equal measure, often wielding a rapid and disarming wit. He is also remembered for supporting women into senior and executive positions and helping them succeed. Director of BBC News Fran Unsworth recalls: ""He was one of journalism's enormous characters and a legend in the television news industry. But the legend and the reported image always belied the man. ""He was immensely kind, thoughtful and caring underneath that image he sometimes projected."" Former deputy director general Mark Byford said: ""He was probably the greatest newsgathering executive ever in the broadcast news business and his organisational skills, competitiveness, eye for a story and steel were extraordinary. ""He was also, behind the facade, a gentle giant who cared for his people with amazing passion and love. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""Many editors, correspondents and presenters in BBC News owe their success to his mentorship - myself included."" After 11 years he left CNN and took up roles first with Reuters TV and then the Wall Street Journal, where his experience and expertise were used to develop their digital video services. He leaves his wife, Nina, son Richard and daughter Nicolette and his daughter Hannah by an earlier marriage to Helen, a former BBC producer.

"It is almost a month since Christmas was ""downsized"" across the country. But in many parts of the UK, people were allowed to meet in Christmas ""bubbles"" - if only for just one day. So what impact did this have? The overall picture shows a sharp increase in cases around this time. However, a closer look at the numbers suggests this trend was already happening and was probably caused by the new, more infectious variant of the virus rather than increased contact between people. Firstly, a quick reminder of the rules. Initially, the plans for the UK would have allowed up to three households to mix indoors between 23 December and 27 December. But on 19 December, Prime Minister Boris Johnson scaled back these Christmas bubbles because infections were beginning to rise sharply, driven in part by a new variant of Covid-19, across south-east England. What are the rules for Christmas bubbles? How worrying are the new coronavirus variants? Gatherings were banned in most of this area, including London, Essex and Kent, (except for people in support bubbles), while in the rest of England, people were allowed to meet only two other households on Christmas Day. Decisions in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland saw the window for gatherings reduced too, and in Wales only two households were allowed to gather. Asurvey from the Office for National Statistics suggests,externalthat roughly half the population in Great Britain who were allowed to hold gatherings did so. However, this doesn't tell us about where in the country gatherings happened or who they involved. Research into social contact across the UK,conducted by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine,external(LSHTM), suggests there was a decline in contact to mid-November levels over the Christmas period, driven by closed schools and workplaces. This means contacts, which are defined as face-to-face meetings of around five minutes or more, were roughly the same as during the second English lockdown. It was also a big decline from contacts seen in the three weeks up to Christmas. Transport use dipped over the Christmas season This is important when looking for spikes because the virus thrives on close contact between people so less contact  means fewer infections. ""I was expecting to see a reduction in contacts because of the closure of schools and workplaces, but potentially an increase in risky contacts,"" says Prof John Edmunds, from the LSHTM's faculty of epidemiology and public health and a member of the government's scientific advisory body, Sage. He says the research did not show an increase in contacts with more vulnerable groups, such as elderly people, as expected. This suggests people may have decided not to spend Christmas with those at higher risk from the virus. Across the UK, cases continued to rise over and after the Christmas period. However, whether this was influenced at all by the Christmas bubbles is very difficult to say. Looking at the data, we might expect to start seeing the impact of a Christmas spike in the first week of the New Year. This is because the typical incubation period - the time for symptoms of the virus to appear - is, on average, about five days. UK coronavirus cases up by 47,525 on Wednesday UK coronavirus infections may be 'stabilising' Did Covid spike after Thanksgiving? That means the sharp increases seen between the 20 and 30 December cannot be attributed to the holiday. In the first few days of 2021, cases continued to rise at the same pace as before Christmas and, in early January, appear to have peaked, although it is too early to tell if the decrease will be sustained. ""I actually can't see any convincing evidence that Christmas actually did anything to make things worse at all, but trying to prove it definitely, one way or another, is not necessarily that easy,"" says Paul Hunter, a professor at the University of East Anglia's medical school. His mathematical modelling suggests cases have increased in line with trends that were happening before households starting mixing over Christmas. And clear analysis on case rates around Christmas is affected by a number of things, including: The spread of the new, more infectious variant across the country which would result in spikes regardless of Christmas bubbles Differentlockdown rules in different parts of the UK,which could see cases rise more quickly in some parts than others When we look specifically at parts of the country where gatherings were allowed, and the new variant was less prevalent, the trend is fairly similar to the country as a whole, albeit with a time lag of a few days. In north-east and north-west England, Scotland and Wales, we see cases rising around the holiday. But those rises start happening before or a couple of days after Christmas Day. This makes it unlikely that the upward trend is sparked by festive bubbles, because there wouldn't have been enough time for people to start exhibiting symptoms if they caught it during the holiday. Data from theOffice for National Statistics infection survey,externalhighlights that these increases start happening around the same time the new more infectious variant increased in those areas. So, it could be that the new strain helped steepen an upward trend that was happening before the holiday. The fact that there hasn't been a specific spike after Christmas doesn't mean that people didn't catch the virus at festive gatherings. ""I am sure that there were some additional cases as a result of contact over Christmas,"" says Prof Edmunds. ""That is almost inevitable with the very high levels of infection that we have at the moment. ""However, the major spike that we saw [around Christmas] was most likely due to the new strain not increases in contacts."" There is limited official data on where people actually catch the virus, butthe test-and-trace programme,externalin England does ask those who test positive where they have been in the days up to developing symptoms. In the week ending 3 January, around 20,000 people said they had visited friends or family in the run-up to testing positive. This was roughly double the number on the week before. This data doesn't mean they caught the virus there but gives an indication of where people had been. It also represents a relatively small proportion of all events people recorded. For example, in the same week 80,000 people said they had been shopping, before testing positive. What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

The page was edited by James Clarke. We will soon be bringing our coronavirus live page to a pause for the day. But before we do, here's a round-up of the main stories today.  By Giancarlo Rinaldi Pilot Douglas Jones, 27, was enjoying his dream job, working for Aegean
Airlines and living in Greece, when the pandemic began last spring - and borders began to close. Fearing being stranded in Greece, he booked a
flight home to Scotland and within a couple of weeks learned his job was gone. Back home, in the small Scottish town of Moffat,
in Dumfries and Galloway, he found himself âdesperate to do somethingâ. ""When you have been used to living in
Berlin and Athens and you move back to Moffat, living with your dad, it is a
bit of slowdown,"" he says. It was a relative of a friend who spotted south
of Scotland firm Alpha Solway was hiring new workers tomeet demand for personal protective equipment
(PPE). It certainly marked a change of pace â the nine-to-five office-based routine was difficult to adjust to for someone accustomed to
navigating the skies of Europe â but Douglas says he was  ""surprised""
by what parts of his old job he could bring to his new post. ""A lot in commercial aviation is about
awareness - situational awareness - and a lot of that can be built into
manufacturing as well,"" he says. While looking forward to returning to the skies one day, he adds: âI have learned a huge amount here. âThere are good people here doing a good job
and I am helping at least with that."" Read more. Children
in England will be able to access free books online during school closures. TheOak National Academy,externalis creating a virtual library,

with The National Literacy Trust,the library will provide one free book each week,
from its author of the week. The first book to feature will be Dame Jacqueline Wilson's
The Story Of Tracy Beaker, which will be available for a week from today. ""Many children's literacy skills
were profoundly affected by the first lockdown and school closures,â said Jonathan
Douglas, chief executive of the National Literacy Trust. ""We will do everything in our power to
support children, families and teachers during this new lockdown period."" This video can not be played Covid-19: Running a roadside van when a pandemic cuts traffic Running a roadside van can give a whole new perspective on a national lockdown. In Wales, car journeys reduced by two-thirds during lockdown periods. ""We haven't seen any of our regular customers since the big lockdown back in March,"" says one business owner, languishing in a silent layby. Hours can go by without seeing a solitary vehicle. But the food vans have also provided a lifeline for hungry hauliers too - when shops and service stations are closed down - and drivers seek refreshment. ""With this pandemic, the money fluctuates - it's up and down - one day, you're rock-bottom, the next day you're flying high,"" says another owner. ""You can't plan anything."" And with the working environment likely to be very different post-pandemic, what future is there for these small businesses? A man told police he had driven from Luton to Devizes to visit a McDonald's, even though the town does not have a branch of the burger chain. Wiltshire Police pointed out he had driven across ""numerous counties"", called his actions a ""flagrant breach"" of lockdown regulations and fined the man Â£200. The 34-year-old was stopped on Estcourt Street in Devizes, a distance of more than 100 miles (160km) from Luton. ""The majority of people across Wiltshire continue to act responsibly and we thank you for that, however, it is important to protect the NHS that we all stick to the rules,"" said police. Up to a fifth of staff in some care home groups have refused a coronavirus vaccine when offered, the PA news agency has been told, with suggestions younger workers are more likely to be resistant. The majority of care home staff who have been offered the jab are getting vaccinated, but data obtained by PA from a number of providers shows between 5% and 21% of staff offered a vaccine have declined it. There is currently no regular data from the NHS or government on how many residents and staff have been given the vaccine, and how many have refused a jab. Care groups have been calling for daily figures so they can check if the government is on track to have offered vaccines to all residents by 24 January and address any take-up issues. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Friday that almost 40% of elderly residents have been vaccinated.  The Israel Prison Service said on Sunday that it will begin vaccinating all prisoners against Covid-19 amid a political row over a policy not to. Public Security Minister Amir Ohana had previously said prisoners in Israeli jails should not be inoculated yet until further notice - on the basis other groups should be prioritised first. The minister faced backlash after saying the vaccinations should only be given to staff, not inmates The order has faced criticism from human rights groups both inside and outside the country, as well as from senior figures such as Defence Minister Benny Gantz, the country's attorney general and the president. âPreventing life-saving medical treatment from people in prison - whether due to a sentence imposed on them by the court or due to detention prior to sentencing - is inconsistent with our values, the values ââof the state, Judaism, and democracy,â President Reuven Rivlin said Thursday. The prison service confirmation comes days after the Minister of Health said the rollout would start in prisons on Monday or Tuesday. Israel has vaccinated at least one vaccine to more than two million of its citizens so far - leading the race globally per capita. A group of London business leaders has written to the government calling for financial support for the struggling rail firm Eurostar. In a letter to the Treasury and Department for Transport, they urge ""swift action to safeguard its future"". Bosses of firms such as Fortnum & Mason signed the letter asking for access to government loans and business rates relief ""at the very least"". The government says it is ""working closely"" with Eurostar. The cross-Channel rail company is threatened by a large drop in passenger numbers due to coronavirus-related travel restrictions. It reported in November that passenger numbers had been down 95% since March 2020.

A further 4,179 patients have been admitted to hospital - down from 4,262 on Saturday. A further 671 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test,according to the latest government figures,external. There were also 38,598 new cases. Yesterday there were 1,295 deaths and 41,346 cases. Concerns are being raised about employees forced to go into workplaces that are not Covid-compliant during lockdown. In just one week in January, the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) received 2,945 complaints about safety issues. The head of the UK's unions is calling for ministers to crack down on employers ""who break Covid safety rules"". ""If the government is upping enforcement, ministers should start with employers who break Covid safety rules,"" says TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady. O'Grady calls for an increase in resources for the HSE ""to stop rogue employers getting away with putting staff at risk"". ""Every employer needs to know an inspection could happen any time,"" she says. A spokeswoman for the HSE says its inspectors ""continue to be out and about, putting employers on the spot and checking that they are complying with health and safety law"". The HSE has carried out more than 32,300 site visits during the pandemic, and introduced telephone spot-checks in response to the coronavirus crisis, she says. Doctors' leaders say the ""patchy supply"" of vaccine to GP surgeries across Scotland is hampering the speed of delivery to patients. Ministers have pledged a first dose of the vaccine to1.4 million of the most vulnerableScots by mid-February. But the British Medical Association in Scotland says inconsistencies in supply make it difficult to plan patient appointments - and some GP surgeries have yet to receive any vaccine at all. Dr Andrew Buist, who chairs the British Medical Association's GP committee in Scotland, says so far ""good progress"" has been made in giving it to priority groups such as care home residents and front-line health staff. But he tells the BBC's Politics Scotland programme: ""The current problem lies with the next priority group, which is the 80-plus group, which GPs in Scotland are set to vaccinate because the supply of the vaccine so far has been quite patchy. ""Some practices have a good supply, some have had none so far."" He says his practice has received 100 doses of the vaccine for 600 patients over the age of 80, who all need to be vaccinated by 5 February. ""We don't want to send out appointments to patients until we know that we can definitively vaccinate them, otherwise patients get very upset."" Health Secretary Jeane Freeman has pledged the workforce and infrastructure will be in place to vaccinate 400,000 people each week by the end of February. Meanwhile no new Covid-related deaths have been reported in Scotland today and while 1,341 new cases of Covid-19 have been reported, that is the lowest daily figure since 28 December. Read more.

Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr Show this morning, Sir Simon Stevens also said he didn't think England ""would have to wait until the autumn"" to see movement over the lockdown restrictions. He added it would be a ""balance of risk"" and a judgement that government and policy makers would have to make. Hospitals in Northern Ireland are preparing for the expected peak of the latest Covid-19 surge this week, a health and social care trust chief has said. Jennifer Welsh, Northern Trust's chief executive, said there was ""huge pressure across the (healthcare) system"" with more intensive care admissions expected. Thirty patients were awaiting admission to Antrim Area Hospital on Sunday morning, she said. There are 840 patients being treated for Covid- 19 across Northern Ireland. Sixty-two of those patients are in intensive care and NI hospitals are working at 95% capacity, with some exceeding that, latest figures show. On Saturday,22 more Covid-19-related deaths were reported in Northern Ireland, bringing the total number of deaths recorded by the Department of Health since the start of the pandemic to 1,581.

Aviation minister Robert Courts says the move is a response to the closure of all UK air corridors from Monday. The aim is to provide grants by the end of this financial year, he says. Industry groups have warned there isonly so long airports can ""run on fumes"", following the announcement of the new quarantine rules. Underthe new rules beginning at 04:00 GMT on Monday,external, all travel corridors - which have been in place to allow arrivals from some countries to forgo quarantine - will close. All arrivals to the UK after that time will need to isolate for up to 10 days, although the quarantine period can be cut short with a negative test after five days. People will also have to show proof of a negative test taken in the previous 72 hours before travelling.

Gwendal Poullennec, the guide's director, has defended the decision to continue with the awards in spite of the pandemic with other rival lists having canceled or altered their rankings this year. ""It's an important decision to support the industry, despite the current situation and perhaps even because of the situation,"" Poullennec tells AFP. Even Michelin star restaurants have made adaptions this year to work around pandemic restrictions He says all three-star businesses will keep their rankings, with demotions only impacting restaurants that have closed or changed their concept completely. The Michelin ceremony will broadcast on YouTube from the Eiffel Tower instead of at a lavish in-person event, AFP reports.

About a tenth of the island's community is currently self-isolating A Covid outbreak on Barra in the Western Isles of Scotland is ""serious, and escalating"", health officials have said, after 17 further cases were identified. There are now more than 110 people in isolation after 27 positive cases, with islanders being urged to stay at home. The number in isolation represents about a tenth of the island's total population. Two people have already been taken off the island for further treatment after testing positive. All close contacts of those who are positive are being offered tests to try and limit the spread of the virus on the island, which has limited medical resources. Read more Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played The boss of NHS England reveals Covid-19 jabs are being done much faster than people are newly catching the virus People in England are being vaccinated four times faster than new cases of the virus are being detected, NHS England's chief executive has said. Sir Simon Stevens told the BBC that 140 people a minute were now being given the jab, usually the first dose of two. But he said the NHS had never been in a more precarious position, with 75% more Covid patients than at the April peak. It comes as a further 298,087 people received their first dose of the vaccine on Saturday. There were also 671 more deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test, and another 38,598 positive tests. Sir Simon told the Andrew Marr Show some hospitals would open for vaccinations 24 hours a day, seven days a week on a trial basis in the next 10 days. He said England was on course to deliver 1.5 million doses this week. Scotland has delivered a total of more than 224,000 first doses, Wales has given over 126,000 and Northern Ireland nearly 118,000 - although Scotland and Wales do not report figures at the weekend. Half of all over-80s have now been vaccinated,Health Secretary Matt Hancock said,external. ""Each jab brings us one step closer to normal,"" he said. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told the BBC that the UK was making ""good progress"" in ensuring every adult was offered a vaccine by September and ""if it can be done more swiftly, that's a bonus"". When, where and how will I get my Covid vaccine? 'Patchy supply' in Scotland hampering vaccine rollout NHS in Wales given 'as many vaccines as it can cope with' How worrying are the new coronavirus variants? More people have now been vaccinated than have had positive tests since the pandemic began, with10 more mass vaccination sitesdue to open in England on Monday. Sir Simon said hospitals and staff were under ""extreme pressure"", however. Asked if the NHS has ever been in a more precarious situation, he said ""no"", adding that the pandemic was a ""unique event"" in its 72-year history. Someone was being admitted to hospital with coronavirus every 30 seconds, Sir Simon said, and since Christmas patient numbers had risen by 15,000 - the equivalent of 30 full hospitals. It means there are 75% more Covid-19 patients in hospital than there were in the April peak, the NHS chief executive said. Although there were promising signs infection rates were falling, he said they were still too high and rising in some areas and age groups, including the over-60s. He said the number of critical care beds had been increased by 50% since the first wave of the pandemic but a ""very small number"" of patients were still having to be transferred between regions when hospitals were full. This video can not be played The foreign secretary said there would be increased UK border checks next week Asked about the ratio of nurses to patients in London intensive care units, Sir Simon said there were sometimes three patients for every nurse rather than the one-to-one ratio normally expected. But patients were receiving the ""highest quality care possible"". About 53,000 NHS staff are currently off work due to the virus, he added. Sir Simon said the health service would only be able to maintain the vaccination rate and ""hold the line if people continue to do the right thing and prevent the transmission of coronavirus"". Vaccinating priority groups by the spring would not mean that ""with one bound we are free"" of coronavirus restrictions, he said. But he added: ""I don't think we will have to wait until the autumn."" He said he suspected that there would be enough supply of the vaccine - ""the crucial thing"" - to begin lifting restrictions before then. Sir Simon also warned that although starting with the most vulnerable groups reduced the risk of deaths, a quarter of hospital patients with the virus were currently under 55 - and therefore not a priority unless they have a medical condition that puts them at additional risk. Asked about suggestions that some vaccination centres were having to throw away leftover doses, he said: ""The guidance from the chief medical officer is crystal clear: every last drop of vaccine should be used."" Many centres were finding they were able to get six doses out of a five-dose vial, and Sir Simon said they should keep a reserve list of staff and high-risk patients who could be contacted to receive a vaccination at short notice. Dr Rosie Shire from the Doctors' Association UK told the BBC that as well as sometimes getting six doses out of the five-dose Pfizer vials, they had also got 11 or 12 doses out of 10-dose AstraZeneca vials. But she said the uncertain dose count made it harder to know how many last-minute appointments to book in order to use up the supply. Mr Raab said that he was not aware of any delays to supplies from manufacturers Pfizer and AstraZeneca and said he was ""confident we have the flexibility"" to deliver enough doses. ""It is an enormous challenge. We are meeting it,"" he said. ""But we take nothing for granted."" The foreign secretary said the risk that new variants could prove resistant to vaccines or more deadly meant the UK had to take the ""precautionary approach"" of requiring all travellers to quarantine on arrival from Monday, closing the travel corridors which previously been exempt. ""We don't want to find in two or three weeks time that our vaccine roll out is imperilled because we haven't taken the precautionary measures on travel corridors,"" he said. Checks by Border Force on the passenger locator forms filled out on arrival would be increased, Mr Raab said, as would the follow-up calls by Public Health England intended to ensure people were isolating for up to 10 days. Asked whether the UK would introduce quarantine hotels to ensure people maintained their isolation, he said all potential measures were under review but there was a challenge in the ""workability"" of the proposal.

"This video can not be played The number of people who had attended pre-Covid marches and polls had suggested support for independence is on the rise. A path to independence is not possible without major changes in the Welsh political landscape, the chairman of Yes Cymru has said. The pro-indy campaign group has seen an upswell in recent months, with membership said to have jumped to over 17,000. Chairman Sion Jobbins said devolution had reached a ""cul de sac"" and changes were needed in Cardiff Bay. Mr Jobbins said: ""The status quo is not an option"". When it was launched in 2016, just a few hundred people turned up to demonstrations, but organisers say that membership has swelled from 2,000, at the start of 2020 to over 17,000. Mr Jobbins said Yes Cymru had created a ""mass movement"" towards independence, and the group was working to reach more people who would not normally be politically engaged. Plaid Cymru pledges independence vote if it wins Senedd election Sport and arts figures join independence rally Is Wales becoming indy-curious? He toldBBC Politics Walesthat the movement would not be supporting one political party at the May Senedd elections, instead urging its members to make their own choice on polling day. He said the group would be contacting all candidates to ask them their views on independence ahead of polling day, and then make it publicly available. But Mr Jobbins said a government needed to be elected in May which ""has a path to independence"". The group contains Labour supporters and members but official party policy is support for devolution within the United Kingdom. Political parties Plaid Cymru, the Green Party, Gwlad Gwlad, and Propelif it is registered in time, would all stand on pro-independence platforms. Mr Jobbins added: ""If there's no change in Cardiff Bay, there is no independence and this is a message also to Yes Cymru supporters"". ""Our individual members, supporters have to make their own personal choice. ""Yes, there is a tension there, there's no denying that... we have a lot of members who are members of the Labour Party,"" he said. ""Certainly, there needs to be a party there [in the Welsh Parliament], which supports independence and either forces another partner to have a clear pathway to trigger independence or it's not going to happen and our supporters need to understand that."" Crowds gathered in Merthyr Tydfil before the coronavirus pandemic during independence marches A row broke out on Twitter recently following a post from the Yes Cymru account saying ""it's Unionism we take umbrage with"" not Conservatism. Asked if there was room for Conservatism in the group, Mr Jobbins said: ""I think there is. ""We know about 10% of people who vote Tory actually would vote for independence... there is room there for conservative-minded people."" Thousands attended independence marches in 2019 Asked by BBC Politics Wales what Welsh independence looks like, he said: ""For Yes Cymru, there's two basic things, which is international recognition, so a seat in the United Nations. And then our own written constitution. ""Does it mean we have the monarchy? That's another question. Does it mean we're in NATO? That's another question. Does it mean we have our own currency? That again is a different question. ""That's for other groups to organise and to campaign for or against,"" he added. Mr Jobbins welcomed Plaid Cymru'sindependence commission report as a ""very big, important step"". He added the report's recommendation of a possible confederal model, whereby an independent Wales would look to pool resources with England and Scotland, is ""totally compatible with being an independent country"". .Plaid independence referendum call rejected by Senedd members The authors of the Plaid-commissioned report outlined the economic difficulties they believe would face an independent Wales. In the report they say: ""It remains hard not to be brought back down to earth by the short, medium - or even long-term cost implications of opting for independence."" Mr Jobbins said he ""would disagree with that"" but that ""it is a challenge"". He added: ""In the 1960s, the Welsh economy was double the size of the economy of the Irish Republic. ""Today, the Irish Republic's economy is four times bigger than Wales' and that's going to get worse. ""It would be a challenge, yes, but we still have a challenge if we stay here. The status quo is not an option and with independence we have all the tools at our disposal"".

"There are warnings more children could be plunged into poverty A decision on whether the Â£20 weekly rise in Universal Credit will be kept in place is unlikely before March's Budget, a top minister has indicated. Campaigners say the uplift, worth more than Â£1,000 a year, has been a lifeline for the vulnerable during the pandemic. Labour will use a Commons debate on Monday to add pressure on ministers to agree now to extend it beyond 31 March. But Dominic Raab told the BBC it was a ""temporary measure"" and the Budget would spell out support ""in the round"". In an interview with Andrew Marr, the foreign secretary confirmed that Conservative MPs would be told to abstain in Monday's debate, meaning Labour's ""opposition day"" motion will be approved. While the motion will not be binding on ministers and won't change policy, the BBC's Ben Wright said not opposing it represented an attempt by the government to ""neutralise"" the issue for the time being. It showed, he added, how concerned ministers were about the prospect of a rebellion by Tory MPs - many of whom want an end to the uncertainty over the issue - if they had been asked to vote against it. Ministers urged to extend lockdown benefit 'boost' Families 'face period of destitution' during Covid The standard Universal Credit allowance, which is claimed by more than 5.5 million households, was increased by Â£20 a week in April 2020 as part of Chancellor Rishi Sunak's early Covid economic response. While it was designed as a temporary response to help those unable to work or struggling due to the lockdown, opposition parties and charities say failing to extend will cause real hardship for hundreds of thousands of people. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation has suggested about 16 million people will be directly affected, with millions of households facing an income loss equivalent to Â£1,040 a year. The organisation has warned 500,000 more people will be driven into poverty, including 200,000 children, while a further 500,000 of those already in poverty will find themselves in even worse hardship. Its director Helen Barnard said a decision could not be delayed any longer. ""The chancellor has said the economy is going to get worse before it gets better and our evidence shows it is those with the least who are often suffering the most,"" she said. ""No one can seriously argue that cutting support for those on the lowest incomes in April will do anything other than weaken our already fragile economy."" Asked whether the government should act now, Mr Raab said Monday's debate was a ""political"" move by the opposition and not about the government's overall financial support during the pandemic. He promised to ""look at everything in the round"" to make sure support for the most vulnerable was available. ""Obviously in March there will be a Budget where again that holistic approach can be taken by the chancellor, but we've put that support in place to make sure that the most vulnerable communities can be protected at this very difficult time,"" he told Andrew Marr. The government says it has injected an extra Â£7bn into the welfare system during the pandemic, including boosting Working Tax Credits by more than Â£1,000 a year for a 12-month period. Labour has urged the government to ""see sense"" on Universal Credit, saying that it would be both morally and economically wrong to ""take Â£1,000 a year from Britain's families"" at the peak of the unemployment crisis.

"UN peacekeepers ended their mission in Darfur last month The number of people killed in clashes between different ethnic groups in Sudan's West Darfur state has risen to 83, a medical body has said. The fighting in the state capital, El Geneina, began on Saturday after a row in which a man was stabbed to death. A state-wide curfew has been imposed and Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok has sent a delegation to investigate. A conflict in Darfur that began in 2003 forced millions to flee and, despite a peace process, tensions remain. Saturday's violence comes less than three weeks after peacekeepers from the United Nations and African Union handed over security to the Khartoum authorities after 13 years there, reports the BBC's Youssef Taha. Why this 14-year-old boy has never seen his 'home' Similar clashes in El Geneina last year, which saw Arab pastoralists fight with non-Arab groups, caused hundreds of casualties. The most recent fighting was centred around a camp for people who had been displaced by the Darfur conflict. A deadly row between two men escalated into a fight involving armed militias, the AFP news agency reports. The Central Committee of Sudan Doctors said the death toll had risen from 48 to 83, and the number of wounded from around 100 to 160. Members of the armed forces were among the victims, it said. Casualties were likely to rise further as fighting was continuing, the medical body added. The government said on Sunday that troop reinforcements would be sent to the area The announcement was made after army chief Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan met top security officials to discuss the violence. A peace deal involving most, but not all, groups in Darfur was signed last year. The Darfur conflict began under the presidency of Omar al-Bashir, who was overthrown in 2019 and is wanted by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for alleged war crimes and genocide in the region. Justice for the people of Darfur was a key rallying cry for civilian groups who backed the ouster of the president after nearly three decades in power. The Sudanese Professionals' Association, which was at the forefront of the anti-Bashir movement, called for the current transitional government to deal with the ""unruly armed groups which have been freely moving and terrorising civilians since the collapse of the former regime"", Sudan's news agency reports.

"Phil Spector pictured in court during his murder trial US music producer Phil Spector has died at the age of 81, while serving a prison sentence for murder. Spector, who transformed pop with his ""wall of sound"" recordings, worked with the Beatles, the Righteous Brothers and Ike and Tina Turner. In 2009, he was convicted of the 2003 murder of Hollywood actress Lana Clarkson. His death was confirmed by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. ""California Health Care Facility inmate Phillip Spector was pronounced deceased of natural causes at 6:35 p.m. on Saturday, January 16, 2021, at an outside hospital. His official cause of death will be determined by the medical examiner in the San Joaquin County Sheriff's Office,"" it said. Spector produced 20 top 40 hits between 1961 and 1965. His production methods influenced major artists including the Beach Boys and Bruce Springsteen. Obituary: Phil Spector His life was ultimately blighted by drug and alcohol addiction, and he all but retired from the music scene during the 1980s and 1990s. In February 2003, actress Lana Clarkson was found dead at his house in Alhambra, California with a bullet wound to her head. Clarkson, who was known for her work in the sword-and-sorcery genre and starred in films including Barbarian Queen, had met Spector hours earlier at a nightclub. Spector claimed the shooting happened when Clarkson ""kissed the gun"" - but his trial heard from four women who claimed Spector had threatened them with guns in the past when they had spurned his advances. Following an initial mistrial, Spector was convicted of second degree murder and given a sentence of 19 years to life. Lana Clarkson was an actress and model who starred in the film 1985 Barbarian Queen Harvey Phillip Spector was born in New York in 1939, to Russian-Jewish parents. His father killed himself when Spector was a boy, and his mother moved her family to Los Angeles. He began his career in his teens as a performer, forming a band - the Teddy Bears - with three high school friends. They had a hit single in 1958 with a song that took its title from the wording on his father's gravestone: ""To know him is to love him."" The record went to number one on the Billboard Hot 100, but the group split the following year. Spector founded his own record label, Philles, in 1961. He produced high-profile 1960s girl groups such as Crystals and the Ronettes, including on 1963 hits Be My Baby and Baby I Love You. He also worked on The Righteous Brothers' hits You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin' and Unchained Melody. Spector produced hits for The Ronettes, later marrying their lead singer Ronnie Bennett His signature production technique, the ""Wall of Sound,"" involved layering several instruments, including strings, woodwind and brass, to give a lush, orchestral sound. In the early 1970s, Spector collaborated with The Beatles on their final album Let It Be, as well as producing John Lennon's solo album Imagine. As the decade progressed, the much-feted producer became reclusive and disturbing accounts of his behaviour became widespread. Spector is said to have held a gun to singer Leonard Cohen's head during sessions for his album Death of a Ladies' Man. Ronettes lead singer Veronica ""Ronnie"" Bennett, who became Spector's second wife and divorced him in 1974, wrote in her 1990 autobiography that he subjected her to years of horrific abuse. She said he had threatened to kill her and display her body in a glass-topped coffin he kept in her basement. ""I can only say that when I left in the early '70s, I knew that if I didn't leave at that time, I was going to die there,"" Ronnie wrote of the time. Writing on Instagram after her ex-husband's death,external, Ronnie Spector said he had been ""a brilliant producer but a lousy husband"". ""When I was working with Phil Spector, watching him create in the recording studio, I knew I was working with the very best,"" she wrote. ""He was in complete control, directing everyone. So much to love about those days. ""Meeting him and falling in love was like a fairytale,"" she continued. ""The magical music we were able to make together was inspired by our love. I loved him madly, and gave my heart and soul to him. ""Unfortunately Phil was not able to live and function outside of the recording studio. Darkness set in, many lives were damaged."" Singer Darlene Love, who sang on several songs Spector produced, said he ""changed the sound of rock 'n' roll"" but likened their relationship to ""a bad marriage"". ""The problem I have with Phil is that he wanted to control Darlene Love's talent,""she told Variety,external. ""If he couldn't do that, he was going to do everything in his power to keep my talent from shining."" Weeks before Lana Clarkson was shot dead, Spector gave a rare interview to British broadsheet The Telegraph. ""I would say I'm probably relatively insane, to an extent,"" he told the paper, adding that he had ""devils inside that fight me"". Responding to news of the producer's death, Blondie guitarist Chris Stein tweeted: ""When we went to Phil Spector's house in the 70s he came to the door holding a bottle of diet Manischewitz wine in one hand and a presumably loaded 45 automatic in the other. Long story. ""I thought he was nuts."" Obituary: Phil Spector At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"Australian Open organisers say the tournament will go ahead despite the coronavirus disruption An Australian Open tennis player has tested positive for Covid-19 amid controversy over cases tied to the event. At least six infected people are in quarantine in Melbourne, officials say. The staging of the international event has been debated in Australia given the country's very low virus numbers and strict entry rules. Players have also expressed frustration about being confined to hotel rooms full-time while many rivals are not. Organisers say the Grand Slam will go ahead despite the disruptions. The infected player has not been identified publicly. Since Saturday, at least 72 players - and other staff - have been ordered to stay in their rooms for two weeks without leaving, after arriving on one of three flights with infected travellers. A total of 15 chartered flights have brought over 1,200 players, staff and officials into Australia for the tournament on 8 February. This video can not be played Competitors in the Australian Open are having to practise in different circumstances this year Players confined to their rooms will not be able to train as much as their competitors in the lead-up to the tournament. Top players such as Victoria Azarenka, Sloane Stephens, Kei Nishikori, Angelique Kerber and the UK's Heather Watson are among them. Some players complained online that they might not have attended had they known the rules. However Tennis Australia insisted they had made the quarantine rules clear. All players taking part in the competition had to test negative before boarding flights and then be placed in designated Australian Open quarantine hotels in Melbourne and Adelaide. Players are allowed out for five hours a day to practise on court, but those on the affected flights will not be allowed out of their room at all for 14 days. Some players said they had not been aware of the rule that everyone on a plane had to isolate if someone on it tested positive. Yulia Putintseva of Kazakhstan wrote on Twitter: ""What I don't understand is that, why no-one ever told us, if one person on board is positive the whole plane need to be isolated...

Tournament organisers negotiated with the Australian government to have the Grand Slam take place this year, amid some debate over whether it should. They arranged chartered flights for players and their teams to be transported to Melbourne and Adelaide ahead of the tournament.These flights have frustrated many Australians, who have not been able to return home because of travel restrictions during the pandemic. The Australians who are trapped in the UK 'Crushed' on Melbourne's path to Covid success The first five coronavirus cases connected to the Australian Open were on flights arriving from Los Angeles in the US, Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Doha, Qatar. Three people - a crew member, a tennis coach and a member of a broadcast team - tested positive on the flight from Los Angeles on Saturday, while two more were identified on the Abu Dhabi and Doha flights. Sylvain Bruneau, the coach of 2019 US Open champion Bianca Andreescu, said he was the positive case on the flight from Abu Dhabi. He had tested negative for Covid-19 within 72 hours before the flight's departure. ""I am extremely saddened and sorry for the consequences now on everyone's shoulders sharing my flight,"" he said in a statement. Georgian tennis player Oksana Kalashnikova said those stuck inside faced a disadvantage, despite Tennis Australia organising deliveries of training equipment and exercise bikes to them. ""The other players will have an advantage because we can't really have the same amount of hours of practice, especially without tennis,"" she told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. Several players have posted light-hearted videos on social media of them hitting rallies against their walls, windows and mattresses.

"Soldiers have been seen near the home of opposition leader Bobi Wine Uganda's main opposition presidential candidate Bobi Wine says his life is being threatened following Thursday's election which saw Yoweri Museveni win a sixth elected term. The singer-turned-politician told the BBC that he rejected the results ""with the contempt they deserve"". He alleged there had been a lot of irregularities but Mr Museveni called it Uganda's fairest ever vote. Campaigning had been marred by violence in which dozens of people died. Just ahead of voting day the government shut down the internet, a move condemned by election monitors. The pop star, the president and a Covid crackdown Why 35 years in power isn't enough for this man The 'ghetto president' aiming for the real thing They said confidence in the count had been damaged by the days-long cut. A government minister told the BBC on Saturday evening that the internet service would be restored ""very soon"". In a phone interview with the BBC World Service, Bobi Wine, the stage name for 38-year-old Robert Kyagulanyi, said he was ""worried about my life and the life of my wife"". He said he was not being allowed to leave his house which was surrounded by security forces. Bobi Wine says he represents the younger generation ""Nobody is allowed to leave or come into our house. Also, all journalists - local and international - have been blocked from accessing me here at home,"" he said. Addressing what his party, National Unity Platform, might do now, he told the BBC that ""all options are now on the table including but not limited to peaceful protest"" but he stressed that he was not calling for violent insurrection. The opposition candidate earlier said: ""I will be happy to share the videos of all the fraud and irregularities as soon as the internet is restored."" The result gives President Museveni, 76 and in power since 1986, five more years as president. Speaking after being declared the winner, he rejected claims of fraud describing the election as likely to be ""the most cheating-free election"" in the country's history. Museveni supporters celebrated in the capital Kampala after the poll results were announced Mr Museveni also alleged that another country in the region had sent ""agents to come meddle in our politics"". ""Foreign meddling will not be tolerated, we do not want foreigners interfering in our affairs. If foreign interference were a source of wealth then Africa would be the richest country in the world."" The president's supporters came out on to the streets of the capital, Kampala, on Saturday to celebrate his victory. Issuing the final result on Saturday, the Electoral Commission said the vote had been peaceful, with a turnout of 57% of the almost 18 million registered voters. 16 January 2021 5.85 millionvotes were won by Yoweri Museveni, according to the Electoral Commission. 3.48 millionvotes were won by Bobi Wine, his main rival, the commission said. 6elected terms as president for Museveni.

By Catherine Byaruhanga, BBC News, Kampala President Yoweri Museveni has seen off countless challengers during his three decades in power - helped along by constitutional changes, which have allowed him to continue running for office. His assurances of security and economic stability continue to win him votes. It's easy to underestimate how much the memories of decades of civil war and a failed state still cast a shadow over this country. Bobi Wine casts a lonely figure - in his home on the outskirts of Kampala. His key advisers have either been arrested or are in hiding. Nevertheless, he will continue to play a key role in Uganda's politics. His National Unity Platform is expected to be the biggest opposition party in parliament. What he says and does can inspire millions both in Uganda and across Africa where youthful political movements are taking hold. Mr Museveni, who came to power on the back of an armed uprising in 1986, stood as leader of the National Resistance Movement (NRM). President Yoweri Museveni says he represents stability He has long been depicted to Ugandans as a liberator and peace bringer. But he has managed to maintain his grip on power through a mixture of encouraging a personality cult, employing patronage, compromising independent institutions and sidelining opponents, says the BBC's Patience Atuhaire.

His party campaigns for basic needs like improving access to healthcare, education, clean water and justice. The 'ghetto president' aiming for the real thing Over the last two decades Bobi Wine's musical output has been filled with songs about these issues and they have inspired a fervent following.

"It is almost a month since Christmas was ""downsized"" across the country. But in many parts of the UK, people were allowed to meet in Christmas ""bubbles"" - if only for just one day. So what impact did this have? The overall picture shows a sharp increase in cases around this time. However, a closer look at the numbers suggests this trend was already happening and was probably caused by the new, more infectious variant of the virus rather than increased contact between people. Firstly, a quick reminder of the rules. Initially, the plans for the UK would have allowed up to three households to mix indoors between 23 December and 27 December. But on 19 December, Prime Minister Boris Johnson scaled back these Christmas bubbles because infections were beginning to rise sharply, driven in part by a new variant of Covid-19, across south-east England. What are the rules for Christmas bubbles? How worrying are the new coronavirus variants? Gatherings were banned in most of this area, including London, Essex and Kent, (except for people in support bubbles), while in the rest of England, people were allowed to meet only two other households on Christmas Day. Decisions in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland saw the window for gatherings reduced too, and in Wales only two households were allowed to gather. Asurvey from the Office for National Statistics suggests,externalthat roughly half the population in Great Britain who were allowed to hold gatherings did so. However, this doesn't tell us about where in the country gatherings happened or who they involved. Research into social contact across the UK,conducted by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine,external(LSHTM), suggests there was a decline in contact to mid-November levels over the Christmas period, driven by closed schools and workplaces. This means contacts, which are defined as face-to-face meetings of around five minutes or more, were roughly the same as during the second English lockdown. It was also a big decline from contacts seen in the three weeks up to Christmas. Transport use dipped over the Christmas season This is important when looking for spikes because the virus thrives on close contact between people so less contact  means fewer infections. ""I was expecting to see a reduction in contacts because of the closure of schools and workplaces, but potentially an increase in risky contacts,"" says Prof John Edmunds, from the LSHTM's faculty of epidemiology and public health and a member of the government's scientific advisory body, Sage. He says the research did not show an increase in contacts with more vulnerable groups, such as elderly people, as expected. This suggests people may have decided not to spend Christmas with those at higher risk from the virus. Across the UK, cases continued to rise over and after the Christmas period. However, whether this was influenced at all by the Christmas bubbles is very difficult to say. Looking at the data, we might expect to start seeing the impact of a Christmas spike in the first week of the New Year. This is because the typical incubation period - the time for symptoms of the virus to appear - is, on average, about five days. UK coronavirus cases up by 47,525 on Wednesday UK coronavirus infections may be 'stabilising' Did Covid spike after Thanksgiving? That means the sharp increases seen between the 20 and 30 December cannot be attributed to the holiday. In the first few days of 2021, cases continued to rise at the same pace as before Christmas and, in early January, appear to have peaked, although it is too early to tell if the decrease will be sustained. ""I actually can't see any convincing evidence that Christmas actually did anything to make things worse at all, but trying to prove it definitely, one way or another, is not necessarily that easy,"" says Paul Hunter, a professor at the University of East Anglia's medical school. His mathematical modelling suggests cases have increased in line with trends that were happening before households starting mixing over Christmas. And clear analysis on case rates around Christmas is affected by a number of things, including: The spread of the new, more infectious variant across the country which would result in spikes regardless of Christmas bubbles Differentlockdown rules in different parts of the UK,which could see cases rise more quickly in some parts than others When we look specifically at parts of the country where gatherings were allowed, and the new variant was less prevalent, the trend is fairly similar to the country as a whole, albeit with a time lag of a few days. In north-east and north-west England, Scotland and Wales, we see cases rising around the holiday. But those rises start happening before or a couple of days after Christmas Day. This makes it unlikely that the upward trend is sparked by festive bubbles, because there wouldn't have been enough time for people to start exhibiting symptoms if they caught it during the holiday. Data from theOffice for National Statistics infection survey,externalhighlights that these increases start happening around the same time the new more infectious variant increased in those areas. So, it could be that the new strain helped steepen an upward trend that was happening before the holiday. The fact that there hasn't been a specific spike after Christmas doesn't mean that people didn't catch the virus at festive gatherings. ""I am sure that there were some additional cases as a result of contact over Christmas,"" says Prof Edmunds. ""That is almost inevitable with the very high levels of infection that we have at the moment. ""However, the major spike that we saw [around Christmas] was most likely due to the new strain not increases in contacts."" There is limited official data on where people actually catch the virus, butthe test-and-trace programme,externalin England does ask those who test positive where they have been in the days up to developing symptoms. In the week ending 3 January, around 20,000 people said they had visited friends or family in the run-up to testing positive. This was roughly double the number on the week before. This data doesn't mean they caught the virus there but gives an indication of where people had been. It also represents a relatively small proportion of all events people recorded. For example, in the same week 80,000 people said they had been shopping, before testing positive. What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

"A statue of Edward Colston was thrown into Bristol Harbour last June, after being pulled down and rolled through the streets The government is planning new laws to protect statues in England from being removed ""on a whim or at the behest of a baying mob"", Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick has said. Writing in the Sunday Telegraph,external, he said generations-old monuments should be ""considered thoughtfully"". The legislation would require planning permission for any changes and a minister would be given the final veto. It will be revealed in Parliament on Monday. The plans followthe toppling of a statue of slave trader Edward Colston last yearand a wider discussion on the removal of controversial monuments. Colston statue removed from Bristol's harbour The city divided by a slave trader's legacy Churchill statue 'may have to be put in museum' Four people were later charged with criminal damageover the removal of the Colston statue, and six people accepted conditional cautions over their involvement. In the paper, the communities secretary said Britain should not try to edit or censor its past. Mr Jenrick said any decision to remove heritage assets in England would require planning permission and a consultation with local communities, adding that he wanted to see a ""considered approach"". He wrote: ""Our view will be set out in law, that such monuments are almost always best explained and contextualised, not taken and hidden away."" Mr Jenrick added that he had noticed an attempt to set a narrative which seeks to erase part of the nation's history, saying this was ""at the hand of the flash mob, or by the decree of a 'cultural committee' of town hall militants and woke worthies"". He said: ""We live in a country that believes in the rule of law, but when it comes to protecting our heritage, due process has been overridden. That can't be right. ""Local people should have the chance to be consulted whether a monument should stand or not. ""What has stood for generations should be considered thoughtfully, not removed on a whim or at the behest of a baying mob."" This video can not be played The Metropolitan Police say they are seeking to identify those responsible for the damage The death of George Floyd while in the custody of police in Minneapolis sparked anti-racism protests across the world. During largely peaceful demonstrations in the UK, the controversial Colston statue was dumped into Bristol Harbour and a memorial to Sir Winston Churchill was vandalised with the words ""was a racist"". Speaking in June, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""The statue of Winston Churchill in Parliament Square is a permanent reminder of his achievement in saving this country - and the whole of Europe - from a fascist and racist tyranny. ""It is absurd and shameful that this national monument should ... be at risk of attack by violent protesters. ""Yes, he sometimes expressed opinions that were and are unacceptable to us today, but he was a hero, and he fully deserves his memorial."" Colston made his fortune in the slave trade and bequeathed his money to charities in Bristol, which led to many venues, streets and landmarks bearing his name. The Society of Merchant Venturers, the Bristol charity which runs institutions named after Edward Colston, saidit was right that the statue was removed, along with other memorials to ""a man who benefited from trading in human lives"". They said it was part of acknowledging Bristol's ""dark past"" and building ""a city where racism and inequality no longer exist"". Following the toppling of the statue, Colston's Girls School changed its name to Montpelier High School and the city's Colston Hall music venue is now known as the Bristol Beacon. A statue of a Black Lives Matter protesterwas placed on the empty plinthwithout permission in July and was removed shortly afterwards.

The page was edited by James Clarke. We will soon be bringing our coronavirus live page to a pause for the day. But before we do, here's a round-up of the main stories today.  By Giancarlo Rinaldi Pilot Douglas Jones, 27, was enjoying his dream job, working for Aegean
Airlines and living in Greece, when the pandemic began last spring - and borders began to close. Fearing being stranded in Greece, he booked a
flight home to Scotland and within a couple of weeks learned his job was gone. Back home, in the small Scottish town of Moffat,
in Dumfries and Galloway, he found himself âdesperate to do somethingâ. ""When you have been used to living in
Berlin and Athens and you move back to Moffat, living with your dad, it is a
bit of slowdown,"" he says. It was a relative of a friend who spotted south
of Scotland firm Alpha Solway was hiring new workers tomeet demand for personal protective equipment
(PPE). It certainly marked a change of pace â the nine-to-five office-based routine was difficult to adjust to for someone accustomed to
navigating the skies of Europe â but Douglas says he was  ""surprised""
by what parts of his old job he could bring to his new post. ""A lot in commercial aviation is about
awareness - situational awareness - and a lot of that can be built into
manufacturing as well,"" he says. While looking forward to returning to the skies one day, he adds: âI have learned a huge amount here. âThere are good people here doing a good job
and I am helping at least with that."" Read more. Children
in England will be able to access free books online during school closures. TheOak National Academy,externalis creating a virtual library,
after schools moved to remote learning for the majority of pupils until at
least February half-term. Formed
with The National Literacy Trust,the library will provide one free book each week,
from its author of the week. The first book to feature will be Dame Jacqueline Wilson's
The Story Of Tracy Beaker, which will be available for a week from today. ""Many children's literacy skills
were profoundly affected by the first lockdown and school closures,â said Jonathan
Douglas, chief executive of the National Literacy Trust. ""We will do everything in our power to
support children, families and teachers during this new lockdown period."" This video can not be played Covid-19: Running a roadside van when a pandemic cuts traffic Running a roadside van can give a whole new perspective on a national lockdown. In Wales, car journeys reduced by two-thirds during lockdown periods. ""We haven't seen any of our regular customers since the big lockdown back in March,"" says one business owner, languishing in a silent layby. Hours can go by without seeing a solitary vehicle. But the food vans have also provided a lifeline for hungry hauliers too - when shops and service stations are closed down - and drivers seek refreshment. ""With this pandemic, the money fluctuates - it's up and down - one day, you're rock-bottom, the next day you're flying high,"" says another owner. ""You can't plan anything."" And with the working environment likely to be very different post-pandemic, what future is there for these small businesses? A man told police he had driven from Luton to Devizes to visit a McDonald's, even though the town does not have a branch of the burger chain. Wiltshire Police pointed out he had driven across ""numerous counties"", called his actions a ""flagrant breach"" of lockdown regulations and fined the man Â£200. The 34-year-old was stopped on Estcourt Street in Devizes, a distance of more than 100 miles (160km) from Luton. ""The majority of people across Wiltshire continue to act responsibly and we thank you for that, however, it is important to protect the NHS that we all stick to the rules,"" said police. Up to a fifth of staff in some care home groups have refused a coronavirus vaccine when offered, the PA news agency has been told, with suggestions younger workers are more likely to be resistant. The majority of care home staff who have been offered the jab are getting vaccinated, but data obtained by PA from a number of providers shows between 5% and 21% of staff offered a vaccine have declined it. There is currently no regular data from the NHS or government on how many residents and staff have been given the vaccine, and how many have refused a jab. Care groups have been calling for daily figures so they can check if the government is on track to have offered vaccines to all residents by 24 January and address any take-up issues. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Friday that almost 40% of elderly residents have been vaccinated.  The Israel Prison Service said on Sunday that it will begin vaccinating all prisoners against Covid-19 amid a political row over a policy not to. Public Security Minister Amir Ohana had previously said prisoners in Israeli jails should not be inoculated yet until further notice - on the basis other groups should be prioritised first. The minister faced backlash after saying the vaccinations should only be given to staff, not inmates The order has faced criticism from human rights groups both inside and outside the country, as well as from senior figures such as Defence Minister Benny Gantz, the country's attorney general and the president. âPreventing life-saving medical treatment from people in prison - whether due to a sentence imposed on them by the court or due to detention prior to sentencing - is inconsistent with our values, the values ââof the state, Judaism, and democracy,â President Reuven Rivlin said Thursday. The prison service confirmation comes days after the Minister of Health said the rollout would start in prisons on Monday or Tuesday. Israel has vaccinated at least one vaccine to more than two million of its citizens so far - leading the race globally per capita. A group of London business leaders has written to the government calling for financial support for the struggling rail firm Eurostar. In a letter to the Treasury and Department for Transport, they urge ""swift action to safeguard its future"". Bosses of firms such as Fortnum & Mason signed the letter asking for access to government loans and business rates relief ""at the very least"". The government says it is ""working closely"" with Eurostar. The cross-Channel rail company is threatened by a large drop in passenger numbers due to coronavirus-related travel restrictions. It reported in November that passenger numbers had been down 95% since March 2020. Read more The government's daily figures also show the number of UK vaccinations is 3,857,266 up to and including 16 January. This is a 298,087 increase from yesterday's total of 3,559,179. A further 4,179 patients have been admitted to hospital - down from 4,262 on Saturday. A further 671 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test,according to the latest government figures,external. There were also 38,598 new cases. Yesterday there were 1,295 deaths and 41,346 cases. Concerns are being raised about employees forced to go into workplaces that are not Covid-compliant during lockdown. In just one week in January, the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) received 2,945 complaints about safety issues. The head of the UK's unions is calling for ministers to crack down on employers ""who break Covid safety rules"". ""If the government is upping enforcement, ministers should start with employers who break Covid safety rules,"" says TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady. O'Grady calls for an increase in resources for the HSE ""to stop rogue employers getting away with putting staff at risk"". ""Every employer needs to know an inspection could happen any time,"" she says. A spokeswoman for the HSE says its inspectors ""continue to be out and about, putting employers on the spot and checking that they are complying with health and safety law"". The HSE has carried out more than 32,300 site visits during the pandemic, and introduced telephone spot-checks in response to the coronavirus crisis, she says. Doctors' leaders say the ""patchy supply"" of vaccine to GP surgeries across Scotland is hampering the speed of delivery to patients. Ministers have pledged a first dose of the vaccine to1.4 million of the most vulnerableScots by mid-February. But the British Medical Association in Scotland says inconsistencies in supply make it difficult to plan patient appointments - and some GP surgeries have yet to receive any vaccine at all. Dr Andrew Buist, who chairs the British Medical Association's GP committee in Scotland, says so far ""good progress"" has been made in giving it to priority groups such as care home residents and front-line health staff. But he tells the BBC's Politics Scotland programme: ""The current problem lies with the next priority group, which is the 80-plus group, which GPs in Scotland are set to vaccinate because the supply of the vaccine so far has been quite patchy. ""Some practices have a good supply, some have had none so far."" He says his practice has received 100 doses of the vaccine for 600 patients over the age of 80, who all need to be vaccinated by 5 February. ""We don't want to send out appointments to patients until we know that we can definitively vaccinate them, otherwise patients get very upset."" Health Secretary Jeane Freeman has pledged the workforce and infrastructure will be in place to vaccinate 400,000 people each week by the end of February. Meanwhile no new Covid-related deaths have been reported in Scotland today and while 1,341 new cases of Covid-19 have been reported, that is the lowest daily figure since 28 December. Read more.

He added it would be a ""balance of risk"" and a judgement that government and policy makers would have to make. Hospitals in Northern Ireland are preparing for the expected peak of the latest Covid-19 surge this week, a health and social care trust chief has said. Jennifer Welsh, Northern Trust's chief executive, said there was ""huge pressure across the (healthcare) system"" with more intensive care admissions expected. Thirty patients were awaiting admission to Antrim Area Hospital on Sunday morning, she said. There are 840 patients being treated for Covid- 19 across Northern Ireland. Sixty-two of those patients are in intensive care and NI hospitals are working at 95% capacity, with some exceeding that, latest figures show. On Saturday,22 more Covid-19-related deaths were reported in Northern Ireland, bringing the total number of deaths recorded by the Department of Health since the start of the pandemic to 1,581.

Industry groups have warned there isonly so long airports can ""run on fumes"", following the announcement of the new quarantine rules. Underthe new rules beginning at 04:00 GMT on Monday,external, all travel corridors - which have been in place to allow arrivals from some countries to forgo quarantine - will close. All arrivals to the UK after that time will need to isolate for up to 10 days, although the quarantine period can be cut short with a negative test after five days.

"This video can not be played Alexei Navalny is led away after arriving back in Moscow from Germany Putin critic Alexei Navalny has been detained after flying back to Moscow from Germany, five months after he was nearly killed by a nerve agent attack. The activist, 44, was led away by police at passport control at Sheremetyevo airport. Thousands had gathered at a different Moscow airport to greet his flight from Berlin, but the plane was diverted. Mr Navalny blames Russian authorities for the attempt on his life last year. The Kremlin denies any role. The opposition politician's allegations have however been backed up by reports from investigative journalists. News of Mr Navalny's detention prompted condemnation from the European Union, France and Italy, which called for his immediate release. US President-elect Joe Biden's incoming national security adviser echoed the call. ""The Kremlin's attacks on Mr Navalny are not just a violation of human rights, but an affront to the Russian people who want their voices heard,"" Jake Sullivan said. When Mr Navalny was poisoned last August and collapsed on an internal flight in Siberia, he was flown to Germany for emergency medical treatment. As he recovered, he said he intended to return to Russia. On Sunday he made good on that pledge, boarding a Pobeda Airlines flight despite warnings he would face arrest on landing. The plane was packed with journalists, including Andrey Kozenko of the BBC Russian Service. Shortly before landing, the pilot announced that for ""technical reasons"", the plane was being diverted from Vnukovo airport to Sheremetyevo airport, causing a stir among the passengers. Alexei Navalny: Russia's vociferous Putin critic ""I know that I'm right. I fear nothing,"" Mr Navalny told supporters and the media upon landing, just minutes before he was detained. ""Have you been waiting for me long?"" he asked border guards. He kissed his wife Yulia - who had flown with him from Germany - after police officers warned they would use physical force if he disobeyed their orders to come with them. Despite pleas, Mr Navalny's lawyer was not allowed to accompany him. The activist is being held at a police station in Moscow. A number of Navalny supporters were detained at Moscow's Vnukovo airport Earlier on Sunday, extra riot police were deployed and metal barriers erected inside Vnukovo airport, where the plane was originally scheduled to land. Russian media reported that a number of activists - including key Navalny ally Lyubov Sobol - had been detained. In a statement late on Sunday, Russia's prison service said the opposition leader ""had been wanted since 29 December 2020 for repeated violations of the probation period"". It added that he would remain in custody until a court decision. The authorities accuse him of violating conditions imposed after a conviction for embezzlement, for which he received a suspended sentence. He has always said the case was politically motivated. Separately, Russian prosecutors have launched a new criminal case against Mr Navalny on fraud charges related to transfers of money to various charities, including his Anti-Corruption Foundation. The activist earlier argued that Mr Putin was doing all he could to stop him from returning to Russia by fabricating new cases against him. The Russian authorities often make out that Alexei Navalny isn't popular with the Russian people, that he's no threat to President Putin. But his return home five months after being poisoned sparked a major police operation on Sunday. In chaotic scenes, riot police pushed Mr Navalny's supporters out of the arrivals hall of Vnukovo airport, before the flight was rerouted. Last summer, Russia's most prominent opposition figure was attacked in Siberia allegedly by an undercover hit squad of Russian security agents. His decision to return home is a direct challenge to Vladimir Putin - and creates a dilemma for the Kremlin. It risks turning him into a political martyr, a Nelson Mandela-like figure, and sparking more Western sanctions. Do nothing and the Kremlin's fiercest critic will almost certainly be a thorn in its side in an important election year. In August, he collapsed on a plane flying from Tomsk in Siberia to Moscow. The pilot diverted the flight to the city of Omsk, where Mr Navalny was admitted to hospital. Two days later, Russian officials allowed him to be airlifted to Germany in an induced coma for specialised treatment. European experts later said he had been poisoned with the extremely toxic chemical weapon Novichok, developed by Soviet scientists in the Cold War. He was released from a hospital in Berlin in September to continue his recuperation. Two hours that saved Alexei Navalny's life Report names 'Russian agents' in Navalny poisoning Mr Navalny said recently he was able to do push-ups and squat exercises, and therefore had probably almost fully recovered. Last month, investigative reporters named three agents of Russia's FSB security service who had travelled to Tomsk at the time Mr Navalny was there, and said the specialist unit had tailed him for years. Alexei Navalny posed as a security official in the phone call with an FSB agent Mr Navalny then duped an FSB agent named Konstantin Kudryavtsev into revealing details of the operation against him in a phone conversation which he recorded and posted online. The agent told him that the Novichok used to poison him had been placed in his underpants. President Putin hasdismissed investigations by the Bellingcat website and other groupsthat have blamed Russian intelligence agents for the attack as ""a trick"". He has alleged his rival is backed by US intelligence services. This video can not be played Does Putin admit any responsibility for ""new Cold War""?

"More than half of the Church of England's 14,000 parishes will not open for Sunday services later, as places of worship are hit hard by Covid-19. Many of the Church's clergy are shielding, while some parishes have decided it is not safe enough to admit worshippers. Most mosques in London did not open for Friday prayers. The Catholic Church in England and Wales says parishes that are able to follow guidelines will still open. Despite coronavirus restrictions, places of worship in England and Wales can open - but many are struggling to do so safely. Places of worship remain closed throughout Scotland, while Northern Ireland's main church denominations are to cease public worship until early February. What are the rules for places of worship? What is the future of religious worship in the UK? Church closures 'unfair' and 'lacking evidence' The Church of England has told the BBC more than half of its parishes - including some cathedrals - will not open for communal prayer on Sunday. Many have moved their worship online. The Church said some of its clergy were shielding, and all parishes were making their own decision. Lincoln Cathedral took the decision to suspend in-person worship and move services online earlier in the week. Rev Canon Nick Brown, Precentor of Lincoln, said the decision was taken ""with a very heavy heart"" but explained: ""To bring people together in worship is at the very heart of our purpose, but having considered expert advice we believe that the best way to help limit the spread of Covid-19 is to suspend public services for the time being."" The Catholic Church in England and Wales says it will keep its churches under review to make sure ""the highest standards of safety are maintained"". It is also organising online masses in many parishes. Britain's most senior Catholic, Cardinal Vincent Nichols, had criticised previous orders for churches to close. John McManus, BBC News correspondent With more than half of the Church of England's parishes closed for communal worship, thousands of Christians are being deprived of spiritual sustenance, at a time when many feel sorely in need of it. Other religions are also grappling with the issue and have worked hard to make their places of worship Covid-compliant by, for example, introducing strict booking and ticketing systems. Many church parishes have adapted by moving services online, a trend mirrored in some Jewish and Muslim denominations. These have been largely successful, and in some cases attracted new audiences from thousands of miles away. However, it's difficult to replicate the sense of community when people can physically and regularly meet up. One Rabbi I spoke to last summer admitted he was worried some of his synagogue regulars, kept away by Covid-19, might never return. There's also a financial aspect. Places of worship rely heavily on the generosity of believers. Weekly donations have been hit by church closures, and many revenue-generating schemes, such as hiring out church halls, have been cancelled. Many of the country's ancient cathedrals make much of their income from tourist admission fees. Different parts of the UK have taken different approaches, with all places of worship currently closed in Scotland, for example. Some Christian leaders, largely accepting of initial closures during the first lockdown, have gradually spoken out in favour of being able to make the decision themselves. But with most shops and sporting facilities closed in England, some campaigners, such as the National Secular Society, have railed against what they say is ""a worrying deference to religious entitlement"". Meanwhile, the Mosques and Imams National Advisory Board has told the BBC although most mosques in England and Wales did open for Friday prayers, the majority in London did not - and it says it has asked its members in areas where the infection rate is rising to work closely with Public Health England and local authorities. Under the latest lockdowns in the UK, there are changes to usual practices for worshippers of all religions. In the areas of the UK where communal worship is allowed, a number of measures are in place, such as carrying out services in the shortest possible time, and ensuring worshippers do not mingle with anyone not in their own household or support bubble. Faith leaders have accepted the need for restrictions. The Muslim Council of Britain urges ""strong caution for mosques wishing to continue remaining open to the public for worship... and for tremendous care to be exercised"". Meanwhile, the Bishop of London, the Rt Rev Sarah Mullally, who has been in charge of the Church of England's plans for resuming services, has said  ""some may feel that it is currently better not to attend in person...

"Carbis Bay is a popular destination for walkers The leaders of most of the world's biggest economies will get a brief taste of the English seaside this June as they gather for the G7 summit. Cornwall's Carbis Bay, known for its sandy beach and clear waters, will be the venue for discussions on debt, climate change and post-Covid recovery. Prime Minister Boris Johnson called it the ""perfect location for such a crucial summit"". The UK, US, Germany, France, Canada, Italy and Japan make up the G7. Leaders from Australia, India, South Korea and the EU will also attend the event, from 11 to 13 June, as guests. What is the G7 and what does it do? Trump delays 'outdated' G7 leaders' summit Visit Cornwall estimates the county will make Â£50m, with the summit providing a boost to tourism and the area's international profile. But the likes of US President Joe Biden, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron are unlikely to enjoy an ice cream and a barefoot stroll through Carbis Bay's surf. G7 summits require security cordons, with anti-globalisation protests having affected several previous get-togethers. Measures in place for the meeting in Biarritz, France, in 2019, saw the seaside resortlikened to a temporary ""fortress"".,external The Cornish meeting will be the first face-to-face G7 since the pandemic started. Last year's event - scheduled to take place at Camp David, Maryland - took place online instead. The previous two UK-hosted meetings were at Lough Erne, Co Fermanagh, in 2013, and Gleneagles, Perth and Kinross, in 2005. Boris Johnson invoked the leading role of Cornwall's mining communities in the industrial revolution This year, delegates will be put up - with Covid restrictions in place - at the Tregenna Castle Resort, overlooking nearby St Ives, and other locations. The National Maritime Museum Cornwall in Falmouth will host international media. The UK is hosting the summit as president of the G7 for the year. ""As the most prominent grouping of democratic countries, the G7 has long been the catalyst for decisive international action to tackle the greatest challenges we face,"" Mr Johnson said. He added that leaders should approach the economic challenges of Covid ""by uniting with a spirit of openness to create a better future"". ""Two-hundred years ago Cornwall's tin and copper mines were at the heart of the UK's industrial revolution and this summer Cornwall will again be the nucleus of great global change and advancement,"" the prime minister said. The 2019 G7 summit in Biarritz involved a huge security operation Visit Cornwall chief executive Malcolm Bell said the summit would ""not only showcase the beauty of Cornwall but give us the opportunity to communicate our heritage, culture and the connections"". Local leaders said it wouldprovide a ""fantastic opportunity"" to showcase the county on the world stage. The government said it would announce more of its plans ""in due course"". The G7 meeting comes five months ahead of UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow in November.

"Nurseries have stayed open during the latest lockdown, unlike schools Nurseries are ""teetering on the edge"" and will ""find it hard to survive with next-to-no funding"" as children are kept home in lockdown, an owner said. Little Stars near Pontypool has seen numbers drop by 35% - and Emma Matthews says nurseries are ""running on empty"". Unlike schools, they have remained open and an industry association wants support so they are around to ""provide places for children in the future"". A Welsh Government spokeswoman said funding was available through councils. Describing childcare workers as ""front-line"", the National Day Nurseries Association (NDNA) Cymru also called for anxious staff to be made a priority for the Covid vaccine as they work with little protective equipment. Nursery closures lead to childcare struggle 'Very little' virus risk at nurseries, says minister What's the science when it comes to schools? ""We feel we have poured our heart into serving families and want acknowledgement for the early years and the vital part we play in the community,"" Ms Matthews said. Little Stars furloughed some staff during the lockdown last March, with nurseriesopen for children of keyworkersonly. Little Stars nursery near Pontypool has seen numbers drop by more than a third They reopened fully last summer and this has remainedunder Welsh Government guidance,external. However, many parents have decided not to send children - some because they are adhering to stay-at-home rules, are self-isolating, have lost their jobs and are struggling to pay bills, or are on furlough. ""The reasons are varied and valid why parents decide to pull children out,"" Ms Matthews added. ""The situation isn't great and some say 'we will wait and see next week'. It's very difficult to formulate a plan then or to furlough. We are teetering on the edge."" Little Stars is down the road from the new Grange hospital that opened in Cwmbran last November Before coronavirus, the nursery looked after 65 children each day - but last week, 47 attended, made up of babies, toddlers and pre-schoolers. There were also 11 babies due to start in January - but only one is attending because of reasons such as new mothers extending their maternity leave. Ms Matthews believes facilities should be open for children of keyworkers only - allowing nurseries to access support for those not attending. A baby, a toddler and a staff member from Little Stars had coronavirus - and employees are worried for themselves and their families. In Wales eligible children can access 30 hours of early-years education and childcare per week for 48 weeks of the year They are unable to wear personal protective equipment because of their close contact with children, and describing workers as ""front-line"" who ""keep the economy going"", Ms Matthews said they should be in the priority group for the vaccine and weekly testing. ""Social distancing is the challenge,"" she added. ""Face, space and hands... we can only do hands. The others are impossible."" The facility received a grant of Â£10,000 at the start of the pandemic and a rate relief grant of Â£1,000, but Ms Matthews wants more support. ""It's about valuing the service,"" she said. ""It wasn't a very stable industry pre-Covid. But it's made it very fragile now."" The Welsh Government has been urged to give more help, allowing nurseries to survive and ""provide places for children in the future"" by NDNA Cymru. It also said early years staff ""must be a priority for the vaccine to enable them to continue providing support for our youngest children and their families"". While nurseries were closed to all but keyworkers initially, they have been open since summer 2020 ""We all know it's impossible to social distance from toddlers and babies who need close care from nappy changing to the contact and affection that supports their development and learning,"" added chief executive Purnima Tanuku. A Welsh Government spokeswoman said while therates of coronavirus in Wales remain high, cases in children under five continue to be relatively low. ""Childcare providers have worked very hard to ensure settings are safe, with low numbers of children on site,"" she added. The spokeswoman said funding is provided to councils, enabling them to help childcare settings experiencing financial difficulties and theChildcare Offer for Wales,externalcontinues to be in place for all eligible children. ""We are following the advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation about the people who should be vaccinated first - all those in the priority groups will be immunised as safely and as quickly as possible,"" she added. Most school children in Wales will learn from home until at least February half-term, unless there is a big drop in Covid cases Children's commissioner Sally Holland said she""empathises with the concerns of staff"" and thanked them for their work ""during an extremely difficult period"". ""Nurseries play a really important part in young children's wellbeing and development,"" she said. ""Any services that can remain open for children is to be welcomed due to the importance for their health and wellbeing.""

"Women selling clothes online are being sent explicit messages, with requests for sex and ""worn"" garments. Both businesses and private individuals have experienced the problem when advertising on mainstream platforms. Women have been sent '""creepy"" messages on Facebook, Instagram, eBay, and Depop, the BBC has learned. Some were asked for additional items including worn tights, explicit photos and used underwear. When inappropriate profiles were blocked or reported, some would reappear with a different account, sources told the BBC. ""During lockdown, the messages have gotten really creepy,"" said Sara Faye, who has sold her clothes on Depop for years. ""They always want to know how many times it has been worn and if it is dirty."" Ms Faye used to post images of herself in the clothes on the platforms but has now stopped because of the messages. Women often model the clothing they're selling in the photos ""Don't message me on an innocent second-hand website, just because you can see a hot girl in the photos,"" she added. ""It feels like a violation, you should be able to sell your clothes online without getting harassed."" Sellers were sometimes offered additional money for used clothing or explicit images. Jennifer Savin - a Cosmopolitan features writer,who recently investigated the topic,external- was offered Â£5 for more than 50 intimate images after posting items on eBay. ""I think there are a lot of users out there, just trying their luck,"" she told the BBC. ""Who knows if they'd even pay up if they were to be sent the explicit content in the first place?"" One online seller, who relies on the profits made on these platforms for a living, said ""it was a balance between feeling safe and needing the money."" Established clothing brands have also reported receiving inappropriate messages and requests on Facebook and Instagram. Lovely's Vintage Emporium sells vintage clothes and receives many such comments every week. Lovely's Vintage Emporium says it receives many inappropriate messages every week ""I get a lot of messages about the model, especially if there are shirts with close-up images,"" said owner Lynnette Peck. ""I had a fetishist asking what [shoes] smelt like, who wore them and if I could take a photo of myself wearing them."" She has now stopped selling certain items on the website, after receiving explicit photographs through Facebook Messenger. Naomi Edmondson, who runs lingerie brand Edge o'Beyond, said the business was ""constantly bombarded with creepy comments from men"", often asking for sex. ""We get so many creepy messages and comments it's too time-consuming to report them all,"" she said. ""A few times I have felt concerned for safety. ""We create lingerie to empower women, we do not welcome the minority of men who think it's acceptable to send explicit pictures."" Edge o'Beyond regularly receives requests for sex Some of the women the BBC spoke to said they hadn't reported the messages because they were ""embarrassed"", ""ashamed"" or ""didn't want to risk losing their accounts"". Others successfully blocked and reported profiles. Facebook, Instagram, Depop and eBay all said they take these kinds of messages seriously and would take action against those who violated policy. They all urged users to report and block any accounts which break the rules. Facebook - which also owns Instagram - said it has built a ""global safety and security team as well as powerful technology"" to remove accounts as quickly as possible. Depop said it aims to respond to 95% reports of inappropriate behaviour within three hours, during business hours. ""The issue of women receiving creepy messages when selling clothes online is not a new phenomenon,"" said Jo O'Reilly, digital privacy expert at ProPrivacy. ""This is particularly concerning because to sell on most popular online selling platforms, including eBay and Depop, it is mandatory for users to provide a postal address - likely to be their home address."" Users could provide a fake address, Ms O'Reilly suggested. But that is technically against the terms and conditions of most selling platforms. ""The very nature of selling second-hand clothes means that sellers will often post photos of themselves wearing the items,"" she says. ""That can, unfortunately, attract unwanted attention from buyers who might wish to buy worn clothes rather than just second-hand items."" Although sites restrict the selling of certain used items, such as underwear, private messaging provides a ""loophole"", she added.

"Cathedrals such as Salisbury - and from Monday, Blackburn - are being used as vaccination centres Ten new mass Covid vaccination centres are to open in England from Monday, as the government bids to meet its target of offering 15 million people in the UK a dose by 15 February. Blackburn Cathedral and St Helens Rugby Ground are among the venues chosen to join theseven hubs already in use. NHS England said the new centres would offer ""thousands"" of jabs a week. It comes as a further 324,233 vaccine doses were administered across the UK, taking the total above 3.5 million. As the latest figures were announced on Saturday, Prime Minister Boris Johnsontweeted,externalhis thanks to ""everyone who is helping in this fantastic national effort"". More people (3.5 million) have now received a Covid vaccination in the UK than have tested positive (3.3 million) for the virus. However, it is believed there have been many more cases than have been recorded, as mass testing was not available during the first peak last spring. How effective is a single vaccine dose against Covid-19? When will you be eligible for the Covid vaccine? How many Covid cases are there in your area? The government has promised all the over-70s, the extremely clinically vulnerable and frontline health and care workers - about 15 million people - will be offered a jab by mid-February. In a video call with NHS staff involved in the vaccine rollout, the Duke of Cambridge encouraged members of the public to get the jab. ""I know what a massive difference it's going to make for everyone,"" he said. ""My grandparents had the vaccine and I'm really proud of them for doing that."" This video can not be played In a video call, the Duke of Cambridge said the vaccination programme was ""tremendous"" And the government urged the public to ""play their part"" in supporting ""the largest vaccination programme in British history"", including helping people attend their appointments. Health Secretary Matt Hancock asked people to commit to three pledges to ""help out"", ""join up"" and ""stay informed"" during ongoing efforts to vaccinate, run clinical trials and share accurate health advice. Bournemouth International Centre, Dorset Taunton Racecourse, Somerset Blackburn Cathedral, Lancashire Salt Hill Activity Centre, Berkshire Norwich Food Court, Norfolk The Lodge in Wickford, Essex Princess Royal Sports Arena, Boston, Lincolnshire St Helens Rugby Ground, Merseyside The park-and-ride at Askham Bar, York Olympic Office Centre in Wembley, north London The seven hubs already in use are in:Etihad Tennis Centre, Manchester; Epsom Downs Racecourse, Surrey; Robertson House, Stevenage; Centre for Life, Newcastle; Ashton Gate Stadium, Bristol; Millennium Point, Birmingham; ExCel, London. Writing in the Sunday Express, Mr Hancock said: ""We can see the way out of this pandemic. We are nearly on the home straight."" He added that vaccines were being rolled out to as many vulnerable people as possible, saying ""we expect tens of millions of people to be vaccinated by the spring"". Asked about reports that the government believes all over-18s could be offered the jab by the end of June, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told Sky News that September remained the target but ""if we can do it faster than that, then great"". He said the plan was still to vaccinate 15 million people by 15 February - 88% of those most at risk of dying from the virus - followed by a another 17 million in the spring, covering 99% of those most at risk. People aged 80 or over, who live up to a 45-minute drive from a centre, are now being offered the choice of arranging a jab at one of the 17 centres, or at a pharmacy site through the national booking service. Anyone not wanting to travel can wait to be contacted by their GP-led vaccination service or hospital. Some 641,000 invitations were sent out last week and another 380,000 were due to land on people's doormats this weekend, NHS England said, with another half a million letters to go out this week. According to the Department of Health and Social Care, around 45% of those aged 80 and over have been vaccinated. Prof David Salisbury, a former director of immunisation at the Department of Health, said the campaign had received a boost because vaccinators had discovered they were able to get six or even seven doses out of vials which were labelled as containing five doses. He told BBC Breakfast that the speed of the vaccination effort depended on how much manufacturers could supply, but this was an ""exciting"" development that would allow people to be get the jab more quickly. GP surgeries could avoid waste by calling up their practice lists to ask people living nearby to come in for a last-minute appointment and use leftover doses, he said. In addition to the mass vaccination hubs, there are around 1,000 GP-led surgeries and more than 250 hospitals providing jabs. DHSC said people could back ""the national effort"" by committing to the government's pledges request. The department said they can ""help out"" through supporting family and friends attending vaccine appointments or becoming an NHS volunteer responder, and ""join up"" to Covid-19 treatment clinical trials. People can also help others ""stay informed"" by sharing accurate NHS advice and being alert for Covid vaccine scams. The ongoing vaccine drive comes as a further 1,295 deaths were reported within 28 days of a positive Covid test - the third-highest daily total since the pandemic began. While daily figures can fluctuate due to delays in reporting, the seven-day average of Covid deaths in the UK has now risen slightly to 1,103. For cases, however, there has been a drop in the seven-day average, with the figure now at 48,565. How worrying are the new coronavirus variants? Protect us from unlawful killing charges - medics A further 4,262 people have been admitted to hospital with the virus, taking the total to 37,475. Dr Yvonne Doyle, medical director for Public Health England, said the ""continuous rise in cases and deaths should be a bitter warning for us all"". ""We must not forget the basics,"" she added. ""The lives of our friends and family depend on it. Keep your distance from others, wash your hands and wear a mask.""

"A financial support scheme for airports in England will open this month, the government says, as the aviation sector faces new Covid travel curbs. Aviation minister Robert Courts said the move was a response to the closure of all UK air corridors from Monday. The aim was to provide grants by the end of this financial year, he said. Industry groups had warned there wasonly so long airports could ""run on fumes"", following the announcement of the new quarantine rules. Underthe new rules beginning at 04:00 GMT on Monday,external, all travel corridors - which have been in place to allow arrivals from some countries to forgo quarantine - will close. All arrivals to the UK after that time will need to isolate for up to 10 days, although the quarantine period can be cut short with a negative test after five days. People will also have to show proof of a negative test taken in the previous 72 hours before travelling. On Sunday, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab also told the BBC'S Andrew Marr Show that Public Health England would also be stepping up checks on travellers who must self-isolate, while enforcement checks at borders would also be ""ramped up"". He added that asking all arrivals to self-isolate in hotels was a ""potential measure"" the government was keeping under review. What are the new rules for travellers? Why hasn't the UK banned all international flights? Airline industry 'needs $80bn more government aid' In a tweet,external, Mr Courts said the Airport and Ground Operations Support Scheme ""will help airports reduce"" additional costs faced due to the pandemic and that further details would follow soon. The scheme had first been announced in November, but without a set start date. It will involve grants of up to Â£8m per applicant, to be used to cover fixed costs, such as business rates. In a statement at the time, the Airport Operators Association said the scheme would be a relief. However, it said support equivalent to business rates would only go so far and with the pandemic crisis deepening, a broader package of support was needed for all four nations, to see the sector through the next few months. AOA chief executive Karen Dee said the measures would ""provide much-needed support to many embattled airports, helping them through the challenging months ahead"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced the changes to the UK's travel rules at a Downing Street briefing on Friday, saying they would ""protect against the risk of as yet unidentified new strains"" of Covid. The new rules will be in place until at least 15 February, he said. Aban on travellers from South America, Portugal and Cape Verdealso came into force on Friday, having been imposed over concerns about a new variant identified in Brazil. New variants causing concern have previously been identifiedin the UKandSouth Africa, with many countries imposing restrictions on arrivals from both nations. Scientists fear the variants seen in South Africa and Brazil mayinterfere with the effectiveness of vaccines and evade parts of the immune system. The government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance told the press briefing on Friday that some of the new variants may be able to ""get round"" the Covid vaccines but it was ""really quite easy"" to adjust the vaccines to deal with mutations in the virus. The travel industry said closing the travel corridors was understandable due to the health emergency, but warned it would deepen the crisis for the sector. Tim Alderslade, chief executive of Airlines UK, said the system had been ""a lifeline for the industry"" last summer but ""things change and there's no doubting this is a serious health emergency"". He said he assumed the government would remove the latest restrictions as soon as it was safe. ""We've had no revenue now effectively for 12 months, give or take a few months in the summer last year. If we're going to have an aviation sector coming out of this we need to open up in the summer,"" he told the BBC. Travel operators had already been forced to cancel holidays before the latest restrictions were announced. Earlier this week, Jet2 suspended all flights and holidays until 25 March over ""ongoing uncertainty"" and budget travel provider EasyJet on Thursday began cancelling holidays up to and including 24 March. The Department for Transport has said it is supporting the travel industry with an extension to the furlough scheme until the end of April, business rates relief and tax deferrals. With all parts of the UK under strict virus rules amid high levels of infection, only essential travel is permitted. On Saturday, another 1,295 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test were reported in the UK, and a further 41,346 lab-confirmed cases of coronavirus.

"Hospitals are preparing for the expected peak of the latest Covid-19 surge this week, the Northern Trust's chief executive has said. Jennifer Welsh said there was ""huge pressure across the (healthcare) system"" with more intensive care admissions expected. Thirty patients were awaiting admission to Antrim Area Hospital on Sunday morning, she said. There were 25 more deaths linked to Covid-19 reported in NI on Sunday. The total number of deaths recorded by the Department of Health since the start of the pandemic is now 1,606. It was also reported that there had been 822 more positive cases, with 67 people in intensive care and 50 people on ventilators. There are 840 patients being treated for Covid- 19 across Northern Ireland, according to the latest available figures with hospitals working at 93% capacity. Meanwhile, Northern Ireland has been continuing its vaccination programme having distributed 140,559 first doses and 20,174 second doses. The total number of jabs administered in the UK, including both first and second doses, is 4,307,002 according to government data. In the Republic of Ireland on Sunday, there were 13 further deaths related to Covid-19, bringing the total number to 2,608 since the start of the pandemic. There was also a further 2,944 positive cases, bringing the total number of cases in the state to 172,726. The Republic of Ireland's Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan said the situation in the country's hospitals was ""stark"" and that people of all ages were being admitted and taken into intensive care. At the beginning of January,Health Minister Robin Swann saidthat modelling indicated the ""peak of the third surge"" would hit in the third week of January. Frontline health staff have spoken to BBC News NIabout their ""exhaustion"" and stress, as the pressure on the system continues to increase amid the surging number of cases. Northern Ireland is currently in the third week of a six-week lockdown, with ministers scheduled to review measures next week. However, health officials have warned that an extension of the restrictions could be required to reduce pressure on the health service. Northern Trust chief executive Jennifer Welsh said hospitals were ""coping but at great cost"" Ms Welsh told BBC NI's Sunday Politics programme that the ""ICU surge is yet to come"" and that the Northern Trust - where two major hospitals, Antrim Area and Causeway, are located - has had to redeploy staff to prepare for the coming days. She said both hospitals had been ""under significant pressure and have been for some time"". She said 30 patients in Antrim Area's Emergency Department are waiting on a bed after a decision was made to admit them - 24 of those patients have been waiting longer than 12 hours. Ms Welsh added that almost half of all patients in Antrim Area Hospital have tested positive for Covid-19. ""At the peak of the first wave in Antrim and Causeway the highest number of Covid positive patients was 73. ""In November, the highest number was 102 and we peaked on Thursday at 202. We have now dropped below that slightly."" The chief executive said the hospitals were ""coping but at great cost"", with many urgent surgeries cancelled. ""Emergency surgery is being done but we are not being able to do any other in the Antrim Area site. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Thanks for joining us. Our coronavirus live page will be back tomorrow morning. The live page writers today were: Victoria Lindrea, Kelly-Leigh Cooper and Alex Therrien. The page was edited by James Clarke. We will soon be bringing our coronavirus live page to a pause for the day. But before we do, here's a round-up of the main stories today.  By Giancarlo Rinaldi Pilot Douglas Jones, 27, was enjoying his dream job, working for Aegean
Airlines and living in Greece, when the pandemic began last spring - and borders began to close. Fearing being stranded in Greece, he booked a
flight home to Scotland and within a couple of weeks learned his job was gone. Back home, in the small Scottish town of Moffat,
in Dumfries and Galloway, he found himself âdesperate to do somethingâ. ""When you have been used to living in
Berlin and Athens and you move back to Moffat, living with your dad, it is a
bit of slowdown,"" he says. It was a relative of a friend who spotted south
of Scotland firm Alpha Solway was hiring new workers tomeet demand for personal protective equipment
(PPE). It certainly marked a change of pace â the nine-to-five office-based routine was difficult to adjust to for someone accustomed to
navigating the skies of Europe â but Douglas says he was  ""surprised""
by what parts of his old job he could bring to his new post. ""A lot in commercial aviation is about
awareness - situational awareness - and a lot of that can be built into
manufacturing as well,"" he says. While looking forward to returning to the skies one day, he adds: âI have learned a huge amount here. âThere are good people here doing a good job
and I am helping at least with that."" Read more. Children
in England will be able to access free books online during school closures. TheOak National Academy,externalis creating a virtual library,
after schools moved to remote learning for the majority of pupils until at
least February half-term. Formed
with The National Literacy Trust,the library will provide one free book each week,
from its author of the week. The first book to feature will be Dame Jacqueline Wilson's
The Story Of Tracy Beaker, which will be available for a week from today. ""Many children's literacy skills
were profoundly affected by the first lockdown and school closures,â said Jonathan
Douglas, chief executive of the National Literacy Trust. ""We will do everything in our power to
support children, families and teachers during this new lockdown period."" This video can not be played Covid-19: Running a roadside van when a pandemic cuts traffic Running a roadside van can give a whole new perspective on a national lockdown. In Wales, car journeys reduced by two-thirds during lockdown periods. ""We haven't seen any of our regular customers since the big lockdown back in March,"" says one business owner, languishing in a silent layby. Hours can go by without seeing a solitary vehicle. But the food vans have also provided a lifeline for hungry hauliers too - when shops and service stations are closed down - and drivers seek refreshment. ""With this pandemic, the money fluctuates - it's up and down - one day, you're rock-bottom, the next day you're flying high,"" says another owner. ""You can't plan anything."" And with the working environment likely to be very different post-pandemic, what future is there for these small businesses? A man told police he had driven from Luton to Devizes to visit a McDonald's, even though the town does not have a branch of the burger chain. Wiltshire Police pointed out he had driven across ""numerous counties"", called his actions a ""flagrant breach"" of lockdown regulations and fined the man Â£200. The 34-year-old was stopped on Estcourt Street in Devizes, a distance of more than 100 miles (160km) from Luton. ""The majority of people across Wiltshire continue to act responsibly and we thank you for that, however, it is important to protect the NHS that we all stick to the rules,"" said police. Up to a fifth of staff in some care home groups have refused a coronavirus vaccine when offered, the PA news agency has been told, with suggestions younger workers are more likely to be resistant. The majority of care home staff who have been offered the jab are getting vaccinated, but data obtained by PA from a number of providers shows between 5% and 21% of staff offered a vaccine have declined it. There is currently no regular data from the NHS or government on how many residents and staff have been given the vaccine, and how many have refused a jab. Care groups have been calling for daily figures so they can check if the government is on track to have offered vaccines to all residents by 24 January and address any take-up issues. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Friday that almost 40% of elderly residents have been vaccinated.  The Israel Prison Service said on Sunday that it will begin vaccinating all prisoners against Covid-19 amid a political row over a policy not to. Public Security Minister Amir Ohana had previously said prisoners in Israeli jails should not be inoculated yet until further notice - on the basis other groups should be prioritised first. The minister faced backlash after saying the vaccinations should only be given to staff, not inmates The order has faced criticism from human rights groups both inside and outside the country, as well as from senior figures such as Defence Minister Benny Gantz, the country's attorney general and the president. âPreventing life-saving medical treatment from people in prison - whether due to a sentence imposed on them by the court or due to detention prior to sentencing - is inconsistent with our values, the values ââof the state, Judaism, and democracy,â President Reuven Rivlin said Thursday. The prison service confirmation comes days after the Minister of Health said the rollout would start in prisons on Monday or Tuesday. Israel has vaccinated at least one vaccine to more than two million of its citizens so far - leading the race globally per capita. A group of London business leaders has written to the government calling for financial support for the struggling rail firm Eurostar. In a letter to the Treasury and Department for Transport, they urge ""swift action to safeguard its future"". Bosses of firms such as Fortnum & Mason signed the letter asking for access to government loans and business rates relief ""at the very least"". The government says it is ""working closely"" with Eurostar. The cross-Channel rail company is threatened by a large drop in passenger numbers due to coronavirus-related travel restrictions. It reported in November that passenger numbers had been down 95% since March 2020. Read more The government's daily figures also show the number of UK vaccinations is 3,857,266 up to and including 16 January. This is a 298,087 increase from yesterday's total of 3,559,179. A further 4,179 patients have been admitted to hospital - down from 4,262 on Saturday. A further 671 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test,according to the latest government figures,external. There were also 38,598 new cases. Yesterday there were 1,295 deaths and 41,346 cases. Concerns are being raised about employees forced to go into workplaces that are not Covid-compliant during lockdown. In just one week in January, the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) received 2,945 complaints about safety issues. The head of the UK's unions is calling for ministers to crack down on employers ""who break Covid safety rules"". ""If the government is upping enforcement, ministers should start with employers who break Covid safety rules,"" says TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady. O'Grady calls for an increase in resources for the HSE ""to stop rogue employers getting away with putting staff at risk"". ""Every employer needs to know an inspection could happen any time,"" she says. A spokeswoman for the HSE says its inspectors ""continue to be out and about, putting employers on the spot and checking that they are complying with health and safety law"". The HSE has carried out more than 32,300 site visits during the pandemic, and introduced telephone spot-checks in response to the coronavirus crisis, she says. Doctors' leaders say the ""patchy supply"" of vaccine to GP surgeries across Scotland is hampering the speed of delivery to patients. Ministers have pledged a first dose of the vaccine to1.4 million of the most vulnerableScots by mid-February. But the British Medical Association in Scotland says inconsistencies in supply make it difficult to plan patient appointments - and some GP surgeries have yet to receive any vaccine at all. Dr Andrew Buist, who chairs the British Medical Association's GP committee in Scotland, says so far ""good progress"" has been made in giving it to priority groups such as care home residents and front-line health staff. But he tells the BBC's Politics Scotland programme: ""The current problem lies with the next priority group, which is the 80-plus group, which GPs in Scotland are set to vaccinate because the supply of the vaccine so far has been quite patchy. ""Some practices have a good supply, some have had none so far."" He says his practice has received 100 doses of the vaccine for 600 patients over the age of 80, who all need to be vaccinated by 5 February. ""We don't want to send out appointments to patients until we know that we can definitively vaccinate them, otherwise patients get very upset."" Health Secretary Jeane Freeman has pledged the workforce and infrastructure will be in place to vaccinate 400,000 people each week by the end of February. Meanwhile no new Covid-related deaths have been reported in Scotland today and while 1,341 new cases of Covid-19 have been reported, that is the lowest daily figure since 28 December. Read more.

He added it would be a ""balance of risk"" and a judgement that government and policy makers would have to make. Hospitals in Northern Ireland are preparing for the expected peak of the latest Covid-19 surge this week, a health and social care trust chief has said. Jennifer Welsh, Northern Trust's chief executive, said there was ""huge pressure across the (healthcare) system"" with more intensive care admissions expected. Thirty patients were awaiting admission to Antrim Area Hospital on Sunday morning, she said. There are 840 patients being treated for Covid- 19 across Northern Ireland. Sixty-two of those patients are in intensive care and NI hospitals are working at 95% capacity, with some exceeding that, latest figures show. On Saturday,22 more Covid-19-related deaths were reported in Northern Ireland, bringing the total number of deaths recorded by the Department of Health since the start of the pandemic to 1,581.

Aviation minister Robert Courts says the move is a response to the closure of all UK air corridors from Monday. The aim is to provide grants by the end of this financial year, he says. Industry groups have warned there isonly so long airports can ""run on fumes"", following the announcement of the new quarantine rules. Underthe new rules beginning at 04:00 GMT on Monday,external, all travel corridors - which have been in place to allow arrivals from some countries to forgo quarantine - will close. All arrivals to the UK after that time will need to isolate for up to 10 days, although the quarantine period can be cut short with a negative test after five days. People will also have to show proof of a negative test taken in the previous 72 hours before travelling.

Gwendal Poullennec, the guide's director, has defended the decision to continue with the awards in spite of the pandemic with other rival lists having canceled or altered their rankings this year. ""It's an important decision to support the industry, despite the current situation and perhaps even because of the situation,"" Poullennec tells AFP. Even Michelin star restaurants have made adaptions this year to work around pandemic restrictions He says all three-star businesses will keep their rankings, with demotions only impacting restaurants that have closed or changed their concept completely. The Michelin ceremony will broadcast on YouTube from the Eiffel Tower instead of at a lavish in-person event, AFP reports. Gemma has cared fulll-time for her father since 2009 A great-grandfather has spoken of his disbelief after a video capturing him receiving his Covid vaccine became an internet hit. When Reg Davies, 84, was vaccinated on Friday, it was the first time he had left his home in Witham, Essex, since the first lockdown last March. His daughter Gemma, 32, captured his glee in a 55-secondTiktok video,externalthat has already clocked up 91,000 views.

About a tenth of the island's community is currently self-isolating A Covid outbreak on Barra in the Western Isles of Scotland is ""serious, and escalating"", health officials have said, after 17 further cases were identified. There are now more than 110 people in isolation after 27 positive cases, with islanders being urged to stay at home. The number in isolation represents about a tenth of the island's total population. Two people have already been taken off the island for further treatment after testing positive. All close contacts of those who are positive are being offered tests to try and limit the spread of the virus on the island, which has limited medical resources. Read more Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played The boss of NHS England reveals Covid-19 jabs are being done much faster than people are newly catching the virus People in England are being vaccinated four times faster than new cases of the virus are being detected, NHS England's chief executive has said. Sir Simon Stevens told the BBC that 140 people a minute were now being given the jab, usually the first dose of two. But he said the NHS had never been in a more precarious position, with 75% more Covid patients than at the April peak. It comes as a further 298,087 people received their first dose of the vaccine on Saturday. There were also 671 more deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test, and another 38,598 positive tests. Sir Simon told the Andrew Marr Show some hospitals would open for vaccinations 24 hours a day, seven days a week on a trial basis in the next 10 days. He said England was on course to deliver 1.5 million doses this week. Scotland has delivered a total of more than 224,000 first doses, Wales has given over 126,000 and Northern Ireland nearly 118,000 - although Scotland and Wales do not report figures at the weekend. Half of all over-80s have now been vaccinated,Health Secretary Matt Hancock said,external. ""Each jab brings us one step closer to normal,"" he said. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told the BBC that the UK was making ""good progress"" in ensuring every adult was offered a vaccine by September and ""if it can be done more swiftly, that's a bonus"".

'Patchy supply' in Scotland hampering vaccine rollout NHS in Wales given 'as many vaccines as it can cope with' How worrying are the new coronavirus variants? More people have now been vaccinated than have had positive tests since the pandemic began, with10 more mass vaccination sitesdue to open in England on Monday. Sir Simon said hospitals and staff were under ""extreme pressure"", however. Asked if the NHS has ever been in a more precarious situation, he said ""no"", adding that the pandemic was a ""unique event"" in its 72-year history. Someone was being admitted to hospital with coronavirus every 30 seconds, Sir Simon said, and since Christmas patient numbers had risen by 15,000 - the equivalent of 30 full hospitals. It means there are 75% more Covid-19 patients in hospital than there were in the April peak, the NHS chief executive said. Although there were promising signs infection rates were falling, he said they were still too high and rising in some areas and age groups, including the over-60s. He said the number of critical care beds had been increased by 50% since the first wave of the pandemic but a ""very small number"" of patients were still having to be transferred between regions when hospitals were full. This video can not be played The foreign secretary said there would be increased UK border checks next week Asked about the ratio of nurses to patients in London intensive care units, Sir Simon said there were sometimes three patients for every nurse rather than the one-to-one ratio normally expected. But patients were receiving the ""highest quality care possible"". About 53,000 NHS staff are currently off work due to the virus, he added. Sir Simon said the health service would only be able to maintain the vaccination rate and ""hold the line if people continue to do the right thing and prevent the transmission of coronavirus"". Vaccinating priority groups by the spring would not mean that ""with one bound we are free"" of coronavirus restrictions, he said. But he added: ""I don't think we will have to wait until the autumn."" He said he suspected that there would be enough supply of the vaccine - ""the crucial thing"" - to begin lifting restrictions before then. Sir Simon also warned that although starting with the most vulnerable groups reduced the risk of deaths, a quarter of hospital patients with the virus were currently under 55 - and therefore not a priority unless they have a medical condition that puts them at additional risk. Asked about suggestions that some vaccination centres were having to throw away leftover doses, he said: ""The guidance from the chief medical officer is crystal clear: every last drop of vaccine should be used."" Many centres were finding they were able to get six doses out of a five-dose vial, and Sir Simon said they should keep a reserve list of staff and high-risk patients who could be contacted to receive a vaccination at short notice. Dr Rosie Shire from the Doctors' Association UK told the BBC that as well as sometimes getting six doses out of the five-dose Pfizer vials, they had also got 11 or 12 doses out of 10-dose AstraZeneca vials. But she said the uncertain dose count made it harder to know how many last-minute appointments to book in order to use up the supply. Mr Raab said that he was not aware of any delays to supplies from manufacturers Pfizer and AstraZeneca and said he was ""confident we have the flexibility"" to deliver enough doses. ""It is an enormous challenge. We are meeting it,"" he said. ""But we take nothing for granted."" The foreign secretary said the risk that new variants could prove resistant to vaccines or more deadly meant the UK had to take the ""precautionary approach"" of requiring all travellers to quarantine on arrival from Monday, closing the travel corridors which previously been exempt. ""We don't want to find in two or three weeks time that our vaccine roll out is imperilled because we haven't taken the precautionary measures on travel corridors,"" he said. Checks by Border Force on the passenger locator forms filled out on arrival would be increased, Mr Raab said, as would the follow-up calls by Public Health England intended to ensure people were isolating for up to 10 days. Asked whether the UK would introduce quarantine hotels to ensure people maintained their isolation, he said all potential measures were under review but there was a challenge in the ""workability"" of the proposal.

"A statue of Edward Colston was thrown into Bristol Harbour last June, after being pulled down and rolled through the streets The government is planning new laws to protect statues in England from being removed ""on a whim or at the behest of a baying mob"", Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick has said. Writing in the Sunday Telegraph,external, he said generations-old monuments should be ""considered thoughtfully"". The legislation would require planning permission for any changes and a minister would be given the final veto. It will be revealed in Parliament on Monday. The plans followthe toppling of a statue of slave trader Edward Colston last yearand a wider discussion on the removal of controversial monuments. Colston statue removed from Bristol's harbour The city divided by a slave trader's legacy Churchill statue 'may have to be put in museum' Four people were later charged with criminal damageover the removal of the Colston statue, and six people accepted conditional cautions over their involvement. In the paper, the communities secretary said Britain should not try to edit or censor its past. Mr Jenrick said any decision to remove heritage assets in England would require planning permission and a consultation with local communities, adding that he wanted to see a ""considered approach"". He wrote: ""Our view will be set out in law, that such monuments are almost always best explained and contextualised, not taken and hidden away."" Mr Jenrick added that he had noticed an attempt to set a narrative which seeks to erase part of the nation's history, saying this was ""at the hand of the flash mob, or by the decree of a 'cultural committee' of town hall militants and woke worthies"". He said: ""We live in a country that believes in the rule of law, but when it comes to protecting our heritage, due process has been overridden. That can't be right. ""Local people should have the chance to be consulted whether a monument should stand or not. ""What has stood for generations should be considered thoughtfully, not removed on a whim or at the behest of a baying mob."" This video can not be played The Metropolitan Police say they are seeking to identify those responsible for the damage The death of George Floyd while in the custody of police in Minneapolis sparked anti-racism protests across the world. During largely peaceful demonstrations in the UK, the controversial Colston statue was dumped into Bristol Harbour and a memorial to Sir Winston Churchill was vandalised with the words ""was a racist"". Speaking in June, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""The statue of Winston Churchill in Parliament Square is a permanent reminder of his achievement in saving this country - and the whole of Europe - from a fascist and racist tyranny. ""It is absurd and shameful that this national monument should ... be at risk of attack by violent protesters. ""Yes, he sometimes expressed opinions that were and are unacceptable to us today, but he was a hero, and he fully deserves his memorial."" Colston made his fortune in the slave trade and bequeathed his money to charities in Bristol, which led to many venues, streets and landmarks bearing his name. The Society of Merchant Venturers, the Bristol charity which runs institutions named after Edward Colston, saidit was right that the statue was removed, along with other memorials to ""a man who benefited from trading in human lives"". They said it was part of acknowledging Bristol's ""dark past"" and building ""a city where racism and inequality no longer exist"". Following the toppling of the statue, Colston's Girls School changed its name to Montpelier High School and the city's Colston Hall music venue is now known as the Bristol Beacon. A statue of a Black Lives Matter protesterwas placed on the empty plinthwithout permission in July and was removed shortly afterwards.

"Cathedrals such as Salisbury - and from Monday, Blackburn - are being used as vaccination centres Ten new mass Covid vaccination centres are to open in England from Monday, as the government bids to meet its target of offering 15 million people in the UK a dose by 15 February. Blackburn Cathedral and St Helens Rugby Ground are among the venues chosen to join theseven hubs already in use. NHS England said the new centres would offer ""thousands"" of jabs a week. It comes as a further 324,233 vaccine doses were administered across the UK, taking the total above 3.5 million. As the latest figures were announced on Saturday, Prime Minister Boris Johnsontweeted,externalhis thanks to ""everyone who is helping in this fantastic national effort"". More people (3.5 million) have now received a Covid vaccination in the UK than have tested positive (3.3 million) for the virus. However, it is believed there have been many more cases than have been recorded, as mass testing was not available during the first peak last spring. How effective is a single vaccine dose against Covid-19? When will you be eligible for the Covid vaccine? How many Covid cases are there in your area? The government has promised all the over-70s, the extremely clinically vulnerable and frontline health and care workers - about 15 million people - will be offered a jab by mid-February. In a video call with NHS staff involved in the vaccine rollout, the Duke of Cambridge encouraged members of the public to get the jab. ""I know what a massive difference it's going to make for everyone,"" he said. ""My grandparents had the vaccine and I'm really proud of them for doing that."" This video can not be played In a video call, the Duke of Cambridge said the vaccination programme was ""tremendous"" And the government urged the public to ""play their part"" in supporting ""the largest vaccination programme in British history"", including helping people attend their appointments. Health Secretary Matt Hancock asked people to commit to three pledges to ""help out"", ""join up"" and ""stay informed"" during ongoing efforts to vaccinate, run clinical trials and share accurate health advice. Bournemouth International Centre, Dorset Taunton Racecourse, Somerset Blackburn Cathedral, Lancashire Salt Hill Activity Centre, Berkshire Norwich Food Court, Norfolk The Lodge in Wickford, Essex Princess Royal Sports Arena, Boston, Lincolnshire St Helens Rugby Ground, Merseyside The park-and-ride at Askham Bar, York Olympic Office Centre in Wembley, north London The seven hubs already in use are in:Etihad Tennis Centre, Manchester; Epsom Downs Racecourse, Surrey; Robertson House, Stevenage; Centre for Life, Newcastle; Ashton Gate Stadium, Bristol; Millennium Point, Birmingham; ExCel, London. Writing in the Sunday Express, Mr Hancock said: ""We can see the way out of this pandemic. We are nearly on the home straight."" He added that vaccines were being rolled out to as many vulnerable people as possible, saying ""we expect tens of millions of people to be vaccinated by the spring"". Asked about reports that the government believes all over-18s could be offered the jab by the end of June, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told Sky News that September remained the target but ""if we can do it faster than that, then great"". He said the plan was still to vaccinate 15 million people by 15 February - 88% of those most at risk of dying from the virus - followed by a another 17 million in the spring, covering 99% of those most at risk. People aged 80 or over, who live up to a 45-minute drive from a centre, are now being offered the choice of arranging a jab at one of the 17 centres, or at a pharmacy site through the national booking service. Anyone not wanting to travel can wait to be contacted by their GP-led vaccination service or hospital. Some 641,000 invitations were sent out last week and another 380,000 were due to land on people's doormats this weekend, NHS England said, with another half a million letters to go out this week. According to the Department of Health and Social Care, around 45% of those aged 80 and over have been vaccinated. Prof David Salisbury, a former director of immunisation at the Department of Health, said the campaign had received a boost because vaccinators had discovered they were able to get six or even seven doses out of vials which were labelled as containing five doses. He told BBC Breakfast that the speed of the vaccination effort depended on how much manufacturers could supply, but this was an ""exciting"" development that would allow people to be get the jab more quickly. GP surgeries could avoid waste by calling up their practice lists to ask people living nearby to come in for a last-minute appointment and use leftover doses, he said. In addition to the mass vaccination hubs, there are around 1,000 GP-led surgeries and more than 250 hospitals providing jabs. DHSC said people could back ""the national effort"" by committing to the government's pledges request. The department said they can ""help out"" through supporting family and friends attending vaccine appointments or becoming an NHS volunteer responder, and ""join up"" to Covid-19 treatment clinical trials. People can also help others ""stay informed"" by sharing accurate NHS advice and being alert for Covid vaccine scams. The ongoing vaccine drive comes as a further 1,295 deaths were reported within 28 days of a positive Covid test - the third-highest daily total since the pandemic began. While daily figures can fluctuate due to delays in reporting, the seven-day average of Covid deaths in the UK has now risen slightly to 1,103. For cases, however, there has been a drop in the seven-day average, with the figure now at 48,565. How worrying are the new coronavirus variants? Protect us from unlawful killing charges - medics A further 4,262 people have been admitted to hospital with the virus, taking the total to 37,475. Dr Yvonne Doyle, medical director for Public Health England, said the ""continuous rise in cases and deaths should be a bitter warning for us all"". ""We must not forget the basics,"" she added. ""The lives of our friends and family depend on it. Keep your distance from others, wash your hands and wear a mask.""

"Wales has received about 250,000 doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and 50,000 doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine so far The NHS is being supplied with as many Covid-19 vaccines as it can cope with, according to a leading doctor. Dr Gill Richardson, chair of Wales' vaccination board, said health boards were receiving doses they asked for. On Friday, First Minister Mark Drakeford said the supply of the Pfizer vaccine was being ""spaced out"" as it had to last until a delivery in February. But opposition parties questioned why supplies were being ""spread out"". Paul Davies, leader of the Conservatives in the Senedd, said it was ""important now to get those vaccines out to people"". Plaid's health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth added it made ""little sense"" to spread out the vaccines, when ""time is of the essence"". When, where and how will I get my Covid vaccine? Q&A: When will I get my Covid-19 vaccine? All over-50s in Wales to be offered jab by spring But a Welsh Government minister defended the rollout and said the vaccine infrastructure is ""growing"". ""We're moving from a situation where we were using 50% of the stock for first vaccine to a situation where we are now using 100%,"" Counsel General Jeremy Milestold the BBC's Politics Wales show. ""In order to deliver that, the infrastructure for vaccinating needs to be increased and that infrastructure is being brought forward."" This video can not be played How will I get my Covid-19 vaccine in Wales? The Tories have called on the Welsh Government toappoint a vaccination ministerlike Prime Minister Boris Johnson has done in England. ""It would make a huge difference because this minister would be able to focus on the vaccination programme and nothing else,"" said Mr Davies. Wales was expected to receive 100,000 doses of the second vaccine - theOxford-AstraZeneca jab- this week but about a quarterare delayed after failing the regulator's tests. Dr Richardson said deliveries of the vaccines have arrived in ""pulses"" and a big consignment of the Pfizer vaccine - around 170,000 doses - arrived in late December. Half the vaccine was initially held back for booster jabs, but they are now being given to people as a first jab in a bid to get as many people vaccinated - and given some protection - as possible. Dr Richardson said they were only giving health boards what they could cope with as, after coming out of deep-freeze storage, the Pfizer jab has to be used within five days. ""We are very conscious that we need to get this out there,"" she told BBC Radio Wales'Sunday Supplement. Two full doses of the Oxford vaccine gave 62% protection, a half dose followed by a full dose was 90% and overall the trial showed 70% protection. ""I know that my colleagues are desperate to immunise our vulnerable people. ""We are now able and have been pushing all the vaccine that our health boards can cope with out to them."" There has been criticism that the rollout of the vaccine has been slower in Wales than in other parts of the UK. Wales has received about 250,000 doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and 50,000 doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine so far. The Welsh Government released a map showing the locations of the mass vaccination centres The Welsh Government said it had been assured it would get more Pfizer vaccines by February, despite shipments of it being temporarily slowed because of changes to the company's manufacturing processes. Dr Richardson said: ""We are going to have a famine, if you like, of Pfizer deliveries at the end of the month. ""That hasn't stopped us pushing out as much vaccine as we can to the health boards. ""But their clinics will run out of the Pfizer vaccine if more does not come."" The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine can be given at GP surgeries The Welsh Government saidone Oxford-AstraZeneca batch out of four had been delayed, affecting 26,000 doses due to be sent to Wales' seven health boards. Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board, which manages the health service in north Wales, said it hadadvised GPs""may wish to delay appointments early next week"" with the planned supply reduced. BBC Wales has contacted the other health boards in Wales to ask if vaccination appointments have been affected, but they have not given details. Dr Richardson said while it was ""a huge issue for this week, it won't be an issue overall for the programme, we are hoping, because we have been reassured by the UK government that supplies (of the Oxford vaccine) are on their way"". Any GPs affected will be prioritised for the next batch of vaccine, she said. Asked if he could guarantee supplies to Wales, Welsh Secretary Simon Hart told the programme: ""Yes, I think I can."" He added: ""There will be the odd occasion when a consignment is rejected or delayed. Nobody should panic about that.""

"This video can not be played Dr Heather Payne says school drop off and pick-ups created 'social mixing opportunities' in the pandemic. The decision to keep schools closed has hit both pupils and parents across Wales. Most children will now be out of the classroom andlearning from homeuntil at least February half-term, unless there is a big drop in Covid cases. The Welsh Government's decisions on coronavirus are assisted by itsTechnical Advisory Cell,external(TAC), a group of experts who assess all the latest scientific advice on the virus. So what exactly is the official scientific advice when it comes to schools? Dr Heather Payne, a consultant paediatrician and a member of TAC, describes her role as helping to get together the ""best advice"" to inform ministers making decisions. Here she answers some questions. Dr Heather Payne says the new variant meant that schools needed to close ""I think the most important thing is that the overall rates of coronavirus infection were going up. We know now that was due to thisnew variant,"" explained Dr Payne. ""It is coronavirus but it's much more infectious than the original one that we were dealing with last year. That in itself led to changing our advice around the operation of schools."" ""Now it might be tempting to think that children are spreading it in schools,"" she said. ""But when we break down the data we find that actually schools are safe, secure environments for children."" However, Dr Payne acknowledged that keeping schools open had meant there were more opportunities for ""social mixing,"" which may help the virus spread, such as walking to and from school, or attending after-school activities. ""Unfortunately, the advice had to change to moderating the amount of time that people spent in school because it was clear that it was associated with greater rates of infection,"" she said. Most children will learn from home until at least February half-term, unless there is a big drop in Covid cases Dr Payne said, despite efforts, scientists were still unable to say for certain where in school environments coronavirus might be passed on. ""I think the problem is that we really don't know, we've asked this question to some of the best scientists in the country,"" she said. ""Even the head of the Office of National Statistics agrees that we just don't have the evidence of where, during the school day, from leaving the house in the morning to getting back in the evening, transmission really takes place."" However, Dr Payne said some areas were riskier than others. Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales ""We know that it's more likely when people are moving around and coming within close contact with each other so that they can have a face-to-face conversation,"" she explained. ""Communal areas, so in the corridors, or just being in large groups in the school. ""We have said that it should be strongly advised that people wear face coverings during that period [between lessons] so that reduces the risk in what are likely to be higher risk areas."" Dr Payne said teachers had also been urged to open classroom windows towards the end of lessons ""so that fresh air can come in and wherever possible."" Dr Payne said advice was for teachers to open classroom windows ""so that fresh air can come in"" ""We are looking at all possibilities,"" explained Dr Payne. ""We have to go back and look at everything."" She said scientists would consider whether schools needed any other measures to be brought in before re-opening, and were continuing to look at issues including Covid testing and face coverings. Schools currently have the choice on whether or not they want to take up testing for pupils when they return. Those that opt in to the roll-out will be given online training for staff. In secondary schools, pupils and staff are currently advised to wear face coverings in all areas outside the classroom. On Wednesday, Education Minister Kirsty Williams said the Welsh Government was reviewing its guidance on schools to see how it could ""make those environments even more secure."" She said it was looking at how to reinforce messages on ""safe behaviours"" for things like walking to school, where children might consider sharing ""mobile phones and cans of fizzy drink."" Despite looking at this range of measures, Dr Payne said one of the biggest factors determining when it might be safe to re-open schools was simply whether enough people were sticking to basic rules outside, like social distancing and not mixing with other households. Children under 11 did not previously have to social distance within bubbles - but schools are now largely closed ""There is some really important research that does show that children can have a wide range of symptoms in coronavirus,"" explained Dr Payne, who is also the Welsh Government's consultant paediatrician. However, she said any child would also have one of the two main symptoms of coronavirus alongside anything else. ""They will have one of the core symptoms, the cough, or the fever. What we've always said is that children present in all sorts of different ways."" Dr Payne said it was more common for children to have a fever with coronavirus, but if there was any doubt, people should look to get a test. ""If you're worried about your child, you should get helpful medical advice from the usual routes, so don't suffer in silence,"" she said. ""Don't sit on a child with a temperature, always take advice."" Young children had been allowed to mix with friends during the summer ""Nurseries are a vital part of supporting both children and the economy and allowing people to work,"" said Dr Payne. ""They have not had to restrict their operations, partly because of the intelligence that we're getting. The evidence is that we are not seeing very many cases in nurseries. If that changes as we monitor it, then it's possible that advice might have to change. ""You have to be conscious of any downside of actions to restrict the spread of infection. ""This is the balance that has been arrived at, for the moment."" Q&A: What is the latest Covid advice for children?

"Sara Powell-Davies said she was lucky her nursery was able to open following lockdown A mother with two young children has said it was ""incredibly stressful"" trying to manage without free childcare during lockdown. The Welsh Government's scheme wassuspended in April, with funds redirected to pay for childcare for key workers' children. Now the offer, available to working parents of three and four-year-olds, has been reinstated. But there are concerns many nurseries have been operating at a loss. Working parents of three and four-year-old children are able to claim up 30 hours of early-years education and childcare a week for 48 weeks a year under the Childcare Offer for Wales. Those whose children become eligible in the autumn term, can apply from September. Substantial risk' nurseries will not survive pandemic Nursery closures lead to childcare struggle for NHS staff Sara Powell-Davies, from Caerphilly, said it had been really hard to manage without the help during the coronavirus pandemic. The mother to three-year-old Tirion and one-year-old Cadel said the free childcare saved the family about Â£200 a month. ""It does make a massive difference to our finances every month,"" she said. Mrs Powell-Davies said, while she was lucky Cadel's nursery was open, after-school clubs would not run in September due to the coronavirus pandemic, which would make juggling childcare around work a challenge. ""It's incredibly stressful trying to manage this anyway,"" she said. ""We do rely on support like private nursery provision, after-school care [and] wraparound because we don't have any family that is able to support us. ""So, this is our lifeline."" Childcare Offer for Wales gives those eligible 30 hours of early-years education and childcare per week for 48 weeks of the year Childcare providers are paid Â£4.50 per hour for every child who takes up a place through the childcare offer. But the National Day Nurseries Association said many of its members were operating at a loss as fewer children had been attending and costs had gone up to comply with Covid-19 safety regulations. Its chief executive Purnima Tanuku called on the Welsh Government to set up a ""transformation fund to be able to support the sector until occupancy levels pick up and to really review the hourly rate to reflect the additional cost they've had to incur"". Lyn Bourne, of Britannia Day Nursery, said nurseries were a ""forgotten industry"" Before the coronavirus pandemic, around 70 children attended Britannia Day Nursery in Caerphilly - now there are about 40. Owner Lyn Bourne said the nursery was losing money every week, but was determined to keep going.""It is hard financially and emotionally, but we decided we wanted to keep going so we've just done our best to do that,"" she said.Ms Bourne said she hoped the childcare offer would help some parents to bring children back, but said nurseries needed extra financial help from the government too.""Nurseries are closing every week,"" she said.""We seem to be a forgotten industry, but we're so important."" Childcare Offer for Wales: Parents 'shocked' by bills Key workers to get free childcare in Wales Free childcare 'could help close wealth gap' The Welsh Government confirmed that coronavirus guidance restricting children to groups of eight in childcare would be lifted. Deputy Minister for Social Care Julie Morgan said: ""Bringing the offer back will not only help parents, but it is crucial for providers too in supporting their businesses to recover after what has been a period of great uncertainty and anxiety for many."" A Welsh Government spokesman said the hourly rate was under review and it was considering extending the offer to parents in education or training or ""on the cusp"" of returning to work. He added: ""The childcare offer being restarted funded childcare for an average of 13,000 children per month before the pandemic, a significant investment in the Welsh childcare sector. ""We have also relaxed some of the regulatory requirements on childcare settings in the national minimum standards to make it easier for them to operate under the current restrictions.""

"A financial support scheme for airports in England will open this month, the government says, as the aviation sector faces new Covid travel curbs. Aviation minister Robert Courts said the move was a response to the closure of all UK air corridors from Monday. The aim was to provide grants by the end of this financial year, he said. Industry groups had warned there wasonly so long airports could ""run on fumes"", following the announcement of the new quarantine rules. Underthe new rules beginning at 04:00 GMT on Monday,external, all travel corridors - which have been in place to allow arrivals from some countries to forgo quarantine - will close. All arrivals to the UK after that time will need to isolate for up to 10 days, although the quarantine period can be cut short with a negative test after five days. People will also have to show proof of a negative test taken in the previous 72 hours before travelling. On Sunday, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab also told the BBC'S Andrew Marr Show that Public Health England would also be stepping up checks on travellers who must self-isolate, while enforcement checks at borders would also be ""ramped up"". He added that asking all arrivals to self-isolate in hotels was a ""potential measure"" the government was keeping under review. What are the new rules for travellers? Why hasn't the UK banned all international flights? Airline industry 'needs $80bn more government aid' In a tweet,external, Mr Courts said the Airport and Ground Operations Support Scheme ""will help airports reduce"" additional costs faced due to the pandemic and that further details would follow soon. The scheme had first been announced in November, but without a set start date. It will involve grants of up to Â£8m per applicant, to be used to cover fixed costs, such as business rates. In a statement at the time, the Airport Operators Association said the scheme would be a relief. However, it said support equivalent to business rates would only go so far and with the pandemic crisis deepening, a broader package of support was needed for all four nations, to see the sector through the next few months. AOA chief executive Karen Dee said the measures would ""provide much-needed support to many embattled airports, helping them through the challenging months ahead"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced the changes to the UK's travel rules at a Downing Street briefing on Friday, saying they would ""protect against the risk of as yet unidentified new strains"" of Covid. The new rules will be in place until at least 15 February, he said. Aban on travellers from South America, Portugal and Cape Verdealso came into force on Friday, having been imposed over concerns about a new variant identified in Brazil. New variants causing concern have previously been identifiedin the UKandSouth Africa, with many countries imposing restrictions on arrivals from both nations. Scientists fear the variants seen in South Africa and Brazil mayinterfere with the effectiveness of vaccines and evade parts of the immune system. The government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance told the press briefing on Friday that some of the new variants may be able to ""get round"" the Covid vaccines but it was ""really quite easy"" to adjust the vaccines to deal with mutations in the virus. The travel industry said closing the travel corridors was understandable due to the health emergency, but warned it would deepen the crisis for the sector. Tim Alderslade, chief executive of Airlines UK, said the system had been ""a lifeline for the industry"" last summer but ""things change and there's no doubting this is a serious health emergency"". He said he assumed the government would remove the latest restrictions as soon as it was safe. ""We've had no revenue now effectively for 12 months, give or take a few months in the summer last year. If we're going to have an aviation sector coming out of this we need to open up in the summer,"" he told the BBC. Travel operators had already been forced to cancel holidays before the latest restrictions were announced. Earlier this week, Jet2 suspended all flights and holidays until 25 March over ""ongoing uncertainty"" and budget travel provider EasyJet on Thursday began cancelling holidays up to and including 24 March. The Department for Transport has said it is supporting the travel industry with an extension to the furlough scheme until the end of April, business rates relief and tax deferrals. With all parts of the UK under strict virus rules amid high levels of infection, only essential travel is permitted. On Saturday, another 1,295 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test were reported in the UK, and a further 41,346 lab-confirmed cases of coronavirus.

"A further 671 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, according to the latest government figures NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens tells the BBC patient numbers have risen by 15,000 since Christmas, but infections are stabilising Sir Simon says a 24/7 vaccinations pilot will begin in 10 days' time The NHS in England is vaccinating at a rate of 140 jabs a minute, he says Simon Stevens said he expects lockdown to be eased gradually, and it will be a ""balance of risk"" Ten more mass Covid vaccination centres are to open in England from Monday UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab says the government's aim is to vaccinate the adult population of the UK by September It aims to get the first priority groups - 15 million people - a dose by 15 February Lifting England's lockdown will not be a ""big bang"" but will see the reintroduction of the tiers system, Dominic Raab says There will be increased checks on those who must quarantine after arriving in the UK, he says Riot police have had to disperse an unauthorised anti-lockdown protest held in Amsterdam Some 190,000 people received Covid-19 jabs on the first day of India's massive vaccination rollout, officials say US president-elect Joe Biden's team says he will enact a series of coronavirus-related policies after he takes office this week More than half of the Church of England's 14,000 parishes are not expected to open for Sunday services today Edited by James Clarke That's it from us for today. Thanks for joining us. Our coronavirus live page will be back tomorrow morning. The live page writers today were: Victoria Lindrea, Kelly-Leigh Cooper and Alex Therrien. The page was edited by James Clarke. We will soon be bringing our coronavirus live page to a pause for the day. But before we do, here's a round-up of the main stories today.  By Giancarlo Rinaldi Pilot Douglas Jones, 27, was enjoying his dream job, working for Aegean
Airlines and living in Greece, when the pandemic began last spring - and borders began to close. Fearing being stranded in Greece, he booked a
flight home to Scotland and within a couple of weeks learned his job was gone. Back home, in the small Scottish town of Moffat,
in Dumfries and Galloway, he found himself âdesperate to do somethingâ. ""When you have been used to living in
Berlin and Athens and you move back to Moffat, living with your dad, it is a
bit of slowdown,"" he says. It was a relative of a friend who spotted south
of Scotland firm Alpha Solway was hiring new workers tomeet demand for personal protective equipment
(PPE). It certainly marked a change of pace â the nine-to-five office-based routine was difficult to adjust to for someone accustomed to
navigating the skies of Europe â but Douglas says he was  ""surprised""
by what parts of his old job he could bring to his new post. ""A lot in commercial aviation is about
awareness - situational awareness - and a lot of that can be built into
manufacturing as well,"" he says. While looking forward to returning to the skies one day, he adds: âI have learned a huge amount here. âThere are good people here doing a good job
and I am helping at least with that."" Read more. Children
in England will be able to access free books online during school closures. TheOak National Academy,externalis creating a virtual library,
after schools moved to remote learning for the majority of pupils until at
least February half-term. Formed
with The National Literacy Trust,the library will provide one free book each week,
from its author of the week. The first book to feature will be Dame Jacqueline Wilson's
The Story Of Tracy Beaker, which will be available for a week from today. ""Many children's literacy skills
were profoundly affected by the first lockdown and school closures,â said Jonathan
Douglas, chief executive of the National Literacy Trust. ""We will do everything in our power to
support children, families and teachers during this new lockdown period."" This video can not be played Covid-19: Running a roadside van when a pandemic cuts traffic Running a roadside van can give a whole new perspective on a national lockdown. In Wales, car journeys reduced by two-thirds during lockdown periods. ""We haven't seen any of our regular customers since the big lockdown back in March,"" says one business owner, languishing in a silent layby. Hours can go by without seeing a solitary vehicle. But the food vans have also provided a lifeline for hungry hauliers too - when shops and service stations are closed down - and drivers seek refreshment. ""With this pandemic, the money fluctuates - it's up and down - one day, you're rock-bottom, the next day you're flying high,"" says another owner. ""You can't plan anything."" And with the working environment likely to be very different post-pandemic, what future is there for these small businesses? A man told police he had driven from Luton to Devizes to visit a McDonald's, even though the town does not have a branch of the burger chain. Wiltshire Police pointed out he had driven across ""numerous counties"", called his actions a ""flagrant breach"" of lockdown regulations and fined the man Â£200. The 34-year-old was stopped on Estcourt Street in Devizes, a distance of more than 100 miles (160km) from Luton. ""The majority of people across Wiltshire continue to act responsibly and we thank you for that, however, it is important to protect the NHS that we all stick to the rules,"" said police. Up to a fifth of staff in some care home groups have refused a coronavirus vaccine when offered, the PA news agency has been told, with suggestions younger workers are more likely to be resistant. The majority of care home staff who have been offered the jab are getting vaccinated, but data obtained by PA from a number of providers shows between 5% and 21% of staff offered a vaccine have declined it. There is currently no regular data from the NHS or government on how many residents and staff have been given the vaccine, and how many have refused a jab. Care groups have been calling for daily figures so they can check if the government is on track to have offered vaccines to all residents by 24 January and address any take-up issues. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Friday that almost 40% of elderly residents have been vaccinated.  The Israel Prison Service said on Sunday that it will begin vaccinating all prisoners against Covid-19 amid a political row over a policy not to. Public Security Minister Amir Ohana had previously said prisoners in Israeli jails should not be inoculated yet until further notice - on the basis other groups should be prioritised first. The minister faced backlash after saying the vaccinations should only be given to staff, not inmates The order has faced criticism from human rights groups both inside and outside the country, as well as from senior figures such as Defence Minister Benny Gantz, the country's attorney general and the president. âPreventing life-saving medical treatment from people in prison - whether due to a sentence imposed on them by the court or due to detention prior to sentencing - is inconsistent with our values, the values ââof the state, Judaism, and democracy,â President Reuven Rivlin said Thursday. The prison service confirmation comes days after the Minister of Health said the rollout would start in prisons on Monday or Tuesday. Israel has vaccinated at least one vaccine to more than two million of its citizens so far - leading the race globally per capita. A group of London business leaders has written to the government calling for financial support for the struggling rail firm Eurostar. In a letter to the Treasury and Department for Transport, they urge ""swift action to safeguard its future"". Bosses of firms such as Fortnum & Mason signed the letter asking for access to government loans and business rates relief ""at the very least"". The government says it is ""working closely"" with Eurostar. The cross-Channel rail company is threatened by a large drop in passenger numbers due to coronavirus-related travel restrictions. It reported in November that passenger numbers had been down 95% since March 2020. Read more The government's daily figures also show the number of UK vaccinations is 3,857,266 up to and including 16 January. This is a 298,087 increase from yesterday's total of 3,559,179. A further 4,179 patients have been admitted to hospital - down from 4,262 on Saturday. A further 671 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test,according to the latest government figures,external. There were also 38,598 new cases. Yesterday there were 1,295 deaths and 41,346 cases. Concerns are being raised about employees forced to go into workplaces that are not Covid-compliant during lockdown. In just one week in January, the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) received 2,945 complaints about safety issues. The head of the UK's unions is calling for ministers to crack down on employers ""who break Covid safety rules"". ""If the government is upping enforcement, ministers should start with employers who break Covid safety rules,"" says TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady. O'Grady calls for an increase in resources for the HSE ""to stop rogue employers getting away with putting staff at risk"". ""Every employer needs to know an inspection could happen any time,"" she says. A spokeswoman for the HSE says its inspectors ""continue to be out and about, putting employers on the spot and checking that they are complying with health and safety law"". The HSE has carried out more than 32,300 site visits during the pandemic, and introduced telephone spot-checks in response to the coronavirus crisis, she says. Doctors' leaders say the ""patchy supply"" of vaccine to GP surgeries across Scotland is hampering the speed of delivery to patients. Ministers have pledged a first dose of the vaccine to1.4 million of the most vulnerableScots by mid-February. But the British Medical Association in Scotland says inconsistencies in supply make it difficult to plan patient appointments - and some GP surgeries have yet to receive any vaccine at all. Dr Andrew Buist, who chairs the British Medical Association's GP committee in Scotland, says so far ""good progress"" has been made in giving it to priority groups such as care home residents and front-line health staff. But he tells the BBC's Politics Scotland programme: ""The current problem lies with the next priority group, which is the 80-plus group, which GPs in Scotland are set to vaccinate because the supply of the vaccine so far has been quite patchy. ""Some practices have a good supply, some have had none so far."" He says his practice has received 100 doses of the vaccine for 600 patients over the age of 80, who all need to be vaccinated by 5 February. ""We don't want to send out appointments to patients until we know that we can definitively vaccinate them, otherwise patients get very upset."" Health Secretary Jeane Freeman has pledged the workforce and infrastructure will be in place to vaccinate 400,000 people each week by the end of February. Meanwhile no new Covid-related deaths have been reported in Scotland today and while 1,341 new cases of Covid-19 have been reported, that is the lowest daily figure since 28 December. Read more.

Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr Show this morning, Sir Simon Stevens also said he didn't think England ""would have to wait until the autumn"" to see movement over the lockdown restrictions. He added it would be a ""balance of risk"" and a judgement that government and policy makers would have to make. Hospitals in Northern Ireland are preparing for the expected peak of the latest Covid-19 surge this week, a health and social care trust chief has said. Jennifer Welsh, Northern Trust's chief executive, said there was ""huge pressure across the (healthcare) system"" with more intensive care admissions expected. Thirty patients were awaiting admission to Antrim Area Hospital on Sunday morning, she said. There are 840 patients being treated for Covid- 19 across Northern Ireland. Sixty-two of those patients are in intensive care and NI hospitals are working at 95% capacity, with some exceeding that, latest figures show. On Saturday,22 more Covid-19-related deaths were reported in Northern Ireland, bringing the total number of deaths recorded by the Department of Health since the start of the pandemic to 1,581. Read more A financial support scheme for airports in England will open this month, the government says, as the aviation sector faces new Covid travel curbs. Aviation minister Robert Courts says the move is a response to the closure of all UK air corridors from Monday. The aim is to provide grants by the end of this financial year, he says. Industry groups have warned there isonly so long airports can ""run on fumes"", following the announcement of the new quarantine rules. Underthe new rules beginning at 04:00 GMT on Monday,external, all travel corridors - which have been in place to allow arrivals from some countries to forgo quarantine - will close. All arrivals to the UK after that time will need to isolate for up to 10 days, although the quarantine period can be cut short with a negative test after five days. People will also have to show proof of a negative test taken in the previous 72 hours before travelling.

""It's an important decision to support the industry, despite the current situation and perhaps even because of the situation,"" Poullennec tells AFP. Even Michelin star restaurants have made adaptions this year to work around pandemic restrictions He says all three-star businesses will keep their rankings, with demotions only impacting restaurants that have closed or changed their concept completely.

"This video can not be played The US Capitol is on high alert ahead of Biden's inauguration All 50 US states and the District of Columbia (DC) are on alert for possible violent protests this weekend, ahead of President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration on Wednesday. National Guard troops have been sent en masse to Washington DC, to deter any repeat of last week's deadly riots. The FBI has warned of possible armed marches by pro-Trump supporters at all 50 state capitols. Meanwhile, the Biden team has set out plans to reverse key Trump policies. In the hours after Mr Biden sets foot in the White House, he will embark on a blitz of executive actions designed to signal a clean break from his predecessor's administration, according to a memo seen by US media. Among the actions: He will return the US to the Paris climate agreement - a global pact on cutting carbon emissions He will repeal the controversial travel ban on a list of mostly Muslim-majority countries He will make wearing masks mandatory on federal property and when travelling interstate Although Mr Biden, like President Trump, will be able to use executive orders as a means of bypassing Congress on some issues,his $1.9tn (Â£1.4tn) stimulus planannounced earlier this week will need to be approved by lawmakers, as will a bill on immigration reform. Much of Washington DC will be locked down ahead of Wednesday's inauguration, with National Guard troops deploying in their thousands. What are far-right Trump supporters saying? At the Capitol: Trump's Christian supporters Who has the FBI arrested so far? Many streets - some miles from the Capitol, the site of deadly rioting on 6 January - have been blocked off with concrete barriers and metal fences. The National Mall, which is usually thronged with thousands of people for inaugurations, has been shut at the request of the Secret Service - the agency charged with protecting the president. The Biden team had already asked Americans to avoid travelling to the nation's capital for the inauguration because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Local officials said people should watch the event remotely. Sunday is expected to also be a particular focus for protests, after posts on pro-Trump and far-right online networks called for armed demonstrations on that day. Some militias have told their followers not to attend, however, citing heavy security or claiming the planned events are police traps. Capitol Police confirmed on Saturday that an armed Virginia man carrying a ""non-government issued credential"" had been stopped and arrested at a security checkpoint on Friday with at least one gun and 509 rounds of ammunition. But the man, named Wesley Allen Beeler, was later released from custody andtold the Washington Post that he did not intend to bring a firearm into Washington,external, where he said he had been working with a private security firm. ""I pulled up to a checkpoint after getting lost in DC because I'm a country boy,"" he said. ""I showed them the inauguration badge that was given to me."" Barricades are being assembled around the US Capitol ahead of the 20 January inauguration of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris The tough security measures follow a week in which Donald Trump became the first US president to be impeached twice.He now faces a Senate trial, on a charge of ""incitement of insurrection"" linked to the storming of the US Capitol by groups of his supporters. They did so in a bid to thwart Congress certifying Joe Biden's victory in the presidential election. When will Trump go on trial in the Senate? Dozens of arrests have been made in relation to the assault on the Capitol building. Among the latest is a far-right media personality known as Baked Alaska - real name Anthime Joseph Gionet.A criminal complaint says,externalhe was arrested in Houston, Texas on Friday and charged with two federal crimes, including violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds. States across the country are also taking precautionary measures, from boarding up capitol windows to refusing to grant permits for rallies. The governors of Maryland, New Mexico and Utah have all declared states of emergency ahead of possible protests at their legislatures. California, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin are among those activating their National Guards, and Texas will shut its state capitol from Saturday until after inauguration day. A fence is being put up around the Michigan state capitol in Lansing According to the director of the Texas Department of Public Safety, intelligence suggested ""violent extremists"" could infiltrate planned protests there to ""conduct criminal acts"". Virginia's Governor Ralph Northam told a news conference on Thursday: ""If you're planning to come here or up to Washington with ill intent in your heart, you need to turn around right now and go home. You are not welcome here, and you're not welcome in our nation's capital. And if you come here and act out, Virginia will be ready."" Analysts believe states that saw especially hostile or protracted election battles are at most risk of violence. One of them, Michigan, has erected a six-foot fence around its capitol in Lansing. ""We are prepared for the worst, but we remain hopeful that those who choose to demonstrate at our capitol do so peacefully,"" the state's Police Director Joe Gasper said on Friday. The building will have an increased police presence until at least mid-February, he added. In October,six men were arrested for allegedly plotting to kidnap and overthrow Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat. The group planned to gather about ""200 men"" to storm the capitol building and take hostages, investigators said. In a further development on Saturday, Facebook said it would temporarily halt adverts for gun accessories and military kit in the US. The site had already banned adverts for guns and ammunition. ""Out of an abundance of caution, we are temporarily banning ads promoting weapons accessories and protective equipment in the US until at least January 22nd,"" spokesperson Liz Bourgeois told Buzzfeed. The move came after three senators and four attorneys general urged Facebook to stop ""placing profit ahead of our Nation's democracy"". What are far-right Trump supporters saying?

"Nurseries have stayed open during the latest lockdown, unlike schools Nurseries are ""teetering on the edge"" and will ""find it hard to survive with next-to-no funding"" as children are kept home in lockdown, an owner said. Little Stars near Pontypool has seen numbers drop by 35% - and Emma Matthews says nurseries are ""running on empty"". Unlike schools, they have remained open and an industry association wants support so they are around to ""provide places for children in the future"". A Welsh Government spokeswoman said funding was available through councils. Describing childcare workers as ""front-line"", the National Day Nurseries Association (NDNA) Cymru also called for anxious staff to be made a priority for the Covid vaccine as they work with little protective equipment. Nursery closures lead to childcare struggle 'Very little' virus risk at nurseries, says minister What's the science when it comes to schools? ""We feel we have poured our heart into serving families and want acknowledgement for the early years and the vital part we play in the community,"" Ms Matthews said. Little Stars furloughed some staff during the lockdown last March, with nurseriesopen for children of keyworkersonly. Little Stars nursery near Pontypool has seen numbers drop by more than a third They reopened fully last summer and this has remainedunder Welsh Government guidance,external. However, many parents have decided not to send children - some because they are adhering to stay-at-home rules, are self-isolating, have lost their jobs and are struggling to pay bills, or are on furlough. ""The reasons are varied and valid why parents decide to pull children out,"" Ms Matthews added. ""The situation isn't great and some say 'we will wait and see next week'. It's very difficult to formulate a plan then or to furlough. We are teetering on the edge."" Little Stars is down the road from the new Grange hospital that opened in Cwmbran last November Before coronavirus, the nursery looked after 65 children each day - but last week, 47 attended, made up of babies, toddlers and pre-schoolers. There were also 11 babies due to start in January - but only one is attending because of reasons such as new mothers extending their maternity leave. Ms Matthews believes facilities should be open for children of keyworkers only - allowing nurseries to access support for those not attending. A baby, a toddler and a staff member from Little Stars had coronavirus - and employees are worried for themselves and their families. In Wales eligible children can access 30 hours of early-years education and childcare per week for 48 weeks of the year They are unable to wear personal protective equipment because of their close contact with children, and describing workers as ""front-line"" who ""keep the economy going"", Ms Matthews said they should be in the priority group for the vaccine and weekly testing. ""Social distancing is the challenge,"" she added. ""Face, space and hands... we can only do hands. The others are impossible."" The facility received a grant of Â£10,000 at the start of the pandemic and a rate relief grant of Â£1,000, but Ms Matthews wants more support. ""It's about valuing the service,"" she said. ""It wasn't a very stable industry pre-Covid. But it's made it very fragile now."" The Welsh Government has been urged to give more help, allowing nurseries to survive and ""provide places for children in the future"" by NDNA Cymru. It also said early years staff ""must be a priority for the vaccine to enable them to continue providing support for our youngest children and their families"". While nurseries were closed to all but keyworkers initially, they have been open since summer 2020 ""We all know it's impossible to social distance from toddlers and babies who need close care from nappy changing to the contact and affection that supports their development and learning,"" added chief executive Purnima Tanuku. A Welsh Government spokeswoman said while therates of coronavirus in Wales remain high, cases in children under five continue to be relatively low. ""Childcare providers have worked very hard to ensure settings are safe, with low numbers of children on site,"" she added. The spokeswoman said funding is provided to councils, enabling them to help childcare settings experiencing financial difficulties and theChildcare Offer for Wales,externalcontinues to be in place for all eligible children. ""We are following the advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation about the people who should be vaccinated first - all those in the priority groups will be immunised as safely and as quickly as possible,"" she added. Most school children in Wales will learn from home until at least February half-term, unless there is a big drop in Covid cases Children's commissioner Sally Holland said she""empathises with the concerns of staff"" and thanked them for their work ""during an extremely difficult period"". ""Nurseries play a really important part in young children's wellbeing and development,"" she said. ""Any services that can remain open for children is to be welcomed due to the importance for their health and wellbeing.""

"Smoke rises from Mount Semeru, the highest volcano on the Indonesian island of Java Indonesia's Mount Semeru has erupted, pouring ash an estimated 5.6km (3.4 miles) into the sky above Java, the country's most densely populated island. No evacuation orders have so far been issued, and no casualties reported. The National Disaster Mitigation Agency (NDMA) warned villagers living on the mountain's slopes to be alert for ongoing volcanic activity. Footage showed ash from the 3,676m (12,060ft) volcano looming over homes. ""The villages of Sumber Mujur and Curah Koboan [in Lumajang municipality] are located in the trajectory of the hot clouds,"" local official Thoriqul Haq said on Saturday. Residents of the Curah Kobokan river basin have been urged to watch for possible ""cold lava"" mudflow, which can be triggered by intense rainfall combining with volcanic material. Mount Semeru erupted at about 17:24 local time (10:24 GMT), authorities said. A picture from the Indonesian National Board for Disaster Management shows ash rolling over the landscape Indonesia sits on the Pacific ""Ring of Fire"" where tectonic plates collide, causing frequent volcanic activity as well as earthquakes. Ring of Fire is active - but that's normal Thousands flee after volcano erupts Semeru - also known as ""The Great Mountain"" - is the highest volcano in Java and one of the most active. It is also one of Indonesia's most popular tourist hiking destinations. The volcano previously erupted in December, when about 550 people were evacuated.

"A further 1,295 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test have been reported in the UK, the third-highest daily total since the pandemic began. It brings the total number of deaths by this measure to 88,590. There have also been a further 41,346 lab-confirmed cases, and 4,262 more people have been admitted to hospital. Dr Yvonne Doyle, medical director for Public Health England, said the ""continuous rise in cases and deaths should be a bitter warning for us all"". ""We must not forget the basics,"" she added. ""The lives of our friends and family depend on it. ""Keep your distance from others, wash your hands and wear a mask."" The latest figures come ahead of Monday'schange in travel rules for the UK, with all travel corridors closing, meaning arrivals from every country will have to quarantine. Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced the changes at Downing Street on Friday, saying they would ""protect against the risk of as yet unidentified new strains"" of Covid. Protect us from unlawful killing charges - medics 'Urgent' aviation support plea over travel curbs 'I caught Covid - and my father-in-law died' While daily figures can fluctuate due to delays in reporting, the seven-day average of Covid deaths in the UK has now risen slightly to 1,103. For cases, however, there has been a drop in the seven-day average, with the figure now at 48,565. There are currently 37,475 people in hospital with the virus, government figures show, while a further 324,233 people have received their first vaccine dose. The government has promised all the over-70s, the extremely clinically vulnerable and front-line health and care workers - about 15 million people - will be offered a jab by mid February. Currently, just over 3.5 million doses have been administered. The government has also announced Â£120m in funds for the social care sector to be used by local authorities to increase staffing levels. Staff absence rates have risen in care homes and among home care staff, due to them testing positive or having to self-isolate. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the money would bolster staffing numbers in a ""controlled and safe way, whilst ensuring people continue to receive the highest quality of care"". A further Â£149m funding was announced in December to support rapid testing of care home staff. Speaking alongside the PM on Friday, England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, said the number of patients being admitted to hospital with coronavirus was set to peak within the next 10 days, while the peak for deaths was also yet to come. He added, however, that he hoped the peak in infections had already happened in the South East, East and London, where there was a surge in the new, more transmissible variant. ""The peak of deaths I fear is in the future, the peak of hospitalisations in some parts of the country may be around about now and beginning to come off the very, very top,"" he said. ""Because people are sticking so well to the guidelines we do think the peaks are coming over the next week to 10 days for most places in terms of new people into hospital."" However, chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance stressed it was a ""suppressed peak"" that would ""boil over for sure"" if controls were eased. He said: ""This is not the natural peak that's going to come down on its own, it's coming down because of the measures that are in place. ""Take the lid off now and it's going to boil over for sure and we're going to end up with a big problem."" Meanwhile, on Saturday, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer suggested he would back further coronavirus measures, as ""the tougher the restrictions now the quicker we get the virus back under control"". Sir Keir said he was ""still worried"" by the number of infections, despite signs they are falling - and that the ""sense that we are through the worst"" of the third wave was wrong. ""Nobody likes restrictions but the tougher the restrictions now the quicker we get the virus back under control, the quicker we reduce the number of hospital admissions and the quicker we get that number of deaths, tragically, down,"" he added.

"Gerry Marsden on a Mersey ferry in 2009 The funeral of Gerry and the Pacemakers singer Gerry Marsden has been held at a church near his beloved River Mersey. Marsdendied, aged 78, in hospitalon 3 January following a blood infection. As the frontman in the band Gerry and the Pacemakers, his hits included Ferry Cross The Mersey and a cover version of You'll Never Walk Alone. Ex-Liverpool boss Sir Kenny Dalglish was among the mourners at the funeral which had to remain small because of Covid restrictions. Sir Kenny managed the club at the time of the 1989 Hillsborough disaster, which led to the deaths of 96 fans who were attending an FA Cup game between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest. Gerry Marsden sings You'll Never Walk Alone before an Anfield match in 2010 Sir Kenny said: ""You'll Never Walk Alone has huge meaning to the lives of Liverpool supporters around the world and is synonymous with the club. ""He will be sadly missed by those who knew him and the millions he never got to meet."" You'll Never Walk Alone became a football terrace anthem for Marsden's hometown club soon after it topped the charts in 1963. The song was played during the funeral by a guitarist while a version of Marsden singing Don't Let The Sun Catch You Crying, a song he wrote for his wife Pauline, also featured. She said: ""We, his family, are totally devastated and have been so moved and amazed at the extent of the respect, love and affection received from all over the world. ""When the time is right and we have come out of this terrible pandemic we hope a fitting memorial can be held for him in the city he loved so much."" Gerry and the Pacemakers was one of the biggest British bands in the 1960s Referring to the lyrics from Ferry Cross the Mersey, close friend Arthur Johnson said: ""He lived close to the banks of the Mersey for all his life and as the words of his song say: 'This land's the place I love and here I'll stay'."" Liverpool City Region mayor Steve Rotheram said: ""I feel privileged he let me into his life, although that makes his passing even more painful."" In 1962, Beatles manager Brian Epstein signed up Gerry and the Pacemakers and, a year later, they became the first band to have their first three songs top the charts - How Do You Do It, I Like It and You'll Never Walk Alone. A flag on the Royal Iris Mersey ferry flew at half mast after the death of Gerry Marsden They were one of the successes of the Merseybeat era, withformer Beatles star Sir Paul McCartney,externalsaying at the time of Marsden's death that: ""Gerry was a mate from our early days in Liverpool"".

"Archie Lyndhurst starred in CBBC sitcom So Awkward CBBC star Archie Lyndhurst, the son of Only Fools and Horses actor Nicholas Lyndhurst, died in his sleep from a brain haemorrhage, his mother has said. Lucy Lyndhurst said a second post-mortem exam had revealed his death was caused by a condition called Acute Lymphoblastic Lymphoma/Leukaemia. She described Archie as ""the most magical human being we have ever met"". The 19-year-old's death on 22 September had had a ""catastrophic effect"" on their family,she wrote on Instagram.,external Archie with his father Nicholas and mother Lucy Smith in 2017 Lucy said she and husband Nicholas were assured by the doctor who explained the post-mortem results to them that there ""wasn't anything anyone could have done as Archie showed no signs of illness"". She said it was ""not leukaemia as we know it"" and that acute in medical terms meant ""rapid"". The couple were ""utterly floored"" to think something like this could happen, she wrote, adding: ""It's very rare and around only 800 people a year die from it."" She said that just days earlier he had been celebrating his birthday with ""the love of his life Nethra"". ""Life is fragile, precious and sometimes incredibly cruel,"" Lucy wrote. She also criticised some media outlets for attempting to garner information about how her son had died from the coroner, before they knew the results of the post mortem themselves. ""To have a coroner call you a few days after your child has died to say the press have been calling for the results of Archie's post mortem, I think stoops to an all time low for us,"" she noted. ""What gives the press the right to badger a coroner's office solely to find the cause of death before the parents? The complete lack of empathy is astounding. We released no information at the time as we had no idea what he had died from.""
