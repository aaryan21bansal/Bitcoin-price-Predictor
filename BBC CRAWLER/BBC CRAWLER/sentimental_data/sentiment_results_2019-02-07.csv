"This video can not be played It is not yet known whose body was recovered from the plane wreckage A body has been recovered from the wreckage of the plane which crashed with Cardiff City footballer Emiliano Sala and pilot David Ibbotson on board. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch said specialist contractors joined the operation in ""challenging conditions"". It was carried out in ""as dignified a way as possible"" and the men's families were kept updated throughout, it said. The wreckage of the plane, which vanished two weeks ago over the English Channel, was found off Guernsey. The Geo Ocean III, the boat carrying the body, arrived at Portland Port in Dorset on Thursday morning as it is the nearest part of the British mainland to where the plane was located. Dorset Police said: ""The arrival of the body into Dorset has been reported to the coroner for Dorset. ""The coroner will investigate the circumstances of this death supported by Dorset Police. A post-mortem examination will be held in due course."" No formal identification has taken place, but the force said both families had been updated. Who is David Mearns? Nantes demand Sala fee from Cardiff Cardiff City 'must move mountains' - manager Warnock Emiliano Sala (left) was on board a plane being flown by pilot David Ibbotson The Piper Malibu N264DB was en route from France to Cardiff, after the 28-year-old Argentine striker made a quick trip back to his former club Nantes two days after his Â£15m transfer to Cardiff was announced. Mr Ibbotson, 59, from Crowle, North Lincolnshire, was at the controls when the flight lost contact with air traffic controllers on 21 January. An official search was called off on 24 January after Guernsey's harbour master said the chances of survival were ""extremely remote"". But an online appeal started by Sala's agent raised Â£324,000 (371,000 euros) for a private search led by marine scientist and oceanographer David Mearns. Working jointly with the AAIB, his ship and the Geo Ocean III, began combing a four square mile area of the English Channel, 24 nautical miles north of Guernsey, to make best use of the available sensors. Mr Mearns said the plane was identified by sonar, before a submersible with cameras was sent underwater to confirm this. A minute's silence was held for Sala and Mr Ibbotson ahead of Cardiff's home game against Bournemouth Cardiff fans left a sea of flowers outside the Cardiff City Stadium in tribute to Emiliano Sala The AAIB used a remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV) to aid the search, with no divers involved. The body was moved first, and separately from the wreckage, to maximise the chances of it being successfully brought to the surface. It said efforts to recover the crashed plane as a whole proved unsuccessful, before being abandoned due to poor weather. ""The weather forecast is poor for the foreseeable future and so the difficult decision was taken to bring the overall operation to a close,"" the AAIB said in a statement. However, the AAIB said video footage captured by the ROV would provide ""valuable evidence"" for its safety investigation. Meanwhile, it has emerged that Sala's former club, French Ligue 1 side Nantes, has demanded Cardiff City pay his Â£15m transfer fee. Sala, 28, was Cardiff's record signing but never played for the club. The fee was due to be paid over three years but Cardiff have withheld the first scheduled payment until they are satisfied with the documentation.

"The government is to outline new powers for the media regulator Ofcom to police social media. It is supposed to make the companies protect users from content involving things like violence, terrorism, cyber-bullying and child abuse. Companies will have to ensure that harmful content is removed quickly and take steps to prevent it appearing in the first place. They had previously relied largely on self-governance. Sites such as YouTube and Facebook have their own rules about what is unacceptable and the way that users are expected to behave towards one another. YouTube releases atransparency report,external, which gives data on its removals of inappropriate content. The video-sharing site owned by Google said that 8.8m videos were taken down between July and September 2019, with 93% of them automatically removed by machines, and two thirds of those clips not receiving a single view. It also removed 3.3 million channels and 517 million comments. Globally, YouTube employs 10,000 people in monitoring and removing content, as well as policy development. Facebook, which owns Instagram, told Reality Check it has more than 35,000 people around the world working on safety and security, and italso releases statistics,externalon its content removals. Between July and September 2019 it took action on 30.3 million pieces of content of which it found 98.4% before any users flagged it. If illegal content, such as ""revenge pornography"" or extremist material, is posted on a social media site, it has previously been the person who posted it, rather than the social media companies, who was most at risk of prosecution. But that may now change. So if the UK has previously mainly relied on social media platforms governing themselves, what do other countries do? Germany's NetzDG law came into effect at the beginning of 2018, applying to companies with more than two million registered users in the country. They were forced to set up procedures to review complaints about content they were hosting, remove anything that was clearly illegal within 24 hours and publish updates every six months about how they were doing. Individuals may be fined up to â¬5m ($5.6m; Â£4.4m) and companies up to â¬50m for failing to comply with these requirements. The government issued its first fine under the new law to Facebook in July 2019. The company had to pay â¬2m (Â£1.7m) for under-reporting illegal activity on its platforms in Germany, although the company complained that the new law had lacked clarity. The EU is considering a clampdown, specifically on terror videos. Social media platforms face finesif they do not delete extremist content within an hour. The EU also introduced the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which set rules on how companies, including social media platforms, store and use people's data. It has also taken action on copyright.Its copyright directive puts the responsibility on platformsto make sure that copyright infringing content is not hosted on their sites. Previous legislation only required the platforms to take down such content if it was pointed out to them. Member states have until 2021 to implement the directive into their domestic law. Australia passed the Sharing of Abhorrent Violent Material Act in 2019, introducing criminal penalties for social media companies, possible jail sentences for tech executives for up to three years and financial penalties worth up to 10% of a company's global turnover. It followed thelive-streaming of the New Zealand shootingson Facebook. In 2015, the Enhancing Online Safety Act created an eSafety Commissioner with the power to demand that social media companies take down harassing or abusive posts. In 2018, the powers were expanded to include revenge porn. The eSafety Commissioner's office can issue companies with 48-hour ""takedown notices"", and fines of up to 525,000 Australian dollars (Â£285,000). But it can also fine individuals up to A$105,000 for posting the content. The legislation was introduced after the death of Charlotte Dawson, a TV presenter and a judge on Australia's Next Top Model, who killed herself in 2014 following a campaign of cyber-bullying against her on Twitter. She had a long history of depression. Cardboard cut-outs were used at demonstrations over Facebook in Washington and Brussels last year A law came into force in Russia in Novembergiving regulators the power to switch off connections to the worldwide web ""in an emergency"" although it is not yet clear how effectively they would be able to do this. Russia's data laws from 2015 required social media companies to store any data about Russians on servers within the country. Its communications watchdogblocked LinkedInand fined Facebook and Twitter for not being clear about how they planned to comply with this. Sites such as Twitter, Google and WhatsApp are blocked in China. Their services are provided instead by Chinese providers such as Weibo, Baidu and WeChat. Chinese authorities have also had some success in restricting access to the virtual private networks that some users have employed to bypass the blocks on sites. The Cyberspace Administration of China announced at the end of January,external2019 that in the previous six months it had closed 733 websites and ""cleaned up"" 9,382 mobile apps, although those are more likely to be illegal gambling apps or copies of existing apps being used for illegal purposes than social media. China has hundreds of thousands of cyber-police, who monitor social media platforms and screen messages that are deemed to be politically sensitive. Some keywords are automatically censored outright, such as references to the 1989 Tiananmen Square incident. New words that are seen as being sensitive are added to a long list of censored words and are either temporarily banned, or are filtered out from social platforms. This piece was originally published in April 2018 and has been updated to reflect the Ofcom proposals and more recent statistics. What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

"This video can not be played Instagram boss Adam Mosseri says he hopes new technology will help to flag images All graphic images of self-harm will be removed from Instagram, the head of the social media platform has told the BBC. The move comes after the father of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life in 2017,said Instagram had ""helped kill"" his daughter. Molly's family found she had been viewing graphic images of self-harm on the site prior to her death. Adam Mosseri said Instagram was trying to balance ""the need to act now and the need to act responsibly"". He added the site was ""not where we need to be on the issues of self-harm and suicide"". When asked by the BBC's Angus Crawford when the images would be removed, Mr Mosseri replied: ""As quickly as we can, responsibly."" Molly's father Ian Russell welcomed Instagram's commitment and said he hoped they would act swiftly to implement their plans. ""It is now time for other social media platforms to take action to recognise the responsibility they too have to their users if the internet is to become a safe place for young and vulnerable people,"" he added. Instagram boss in talks over self-harm content Girl, 12, was 'hooked' on self-harm images Facebook 'sorry' for distressing suicide posts Beyond Today podcast: How bad is social media for my mental health? How can governments regulate social media? Health Secretary Matt Hancock described the death of Molly Russell as ""every parents' modern nightmare"". He said it was right for Instagram to take down ""the most graphic material"" but added that ""we need to be led by what the clinicians and experts say need to be taken down"". Speaking after a meeting with social media companies as well as the Samaritans, Mr Hancock said he wanted to see a duty of care for all users of social media and that he was ""perfectly prepared to legislate if necessary"". Digital minister Margot James told BBC Radio 4's PM programme the government would ""have to keep the situation very closely under review to make sure that these commitments are made real - and as swiftly as possible"". Instagram currently relies on users to report graphic images of self-harm, but Mr Mosseri said the company was looking at ways that technology could help solve the problem in the future. He added: ""Historically, we have allowed content related to self-harm that's 'admission' because people sometimes need to tell their story - but we haven't allowed anything that promoted self-harm. ""But, moving forward, we're going to change our policy to not allow any graphic images of self-harm."" This video can not be played After Molly Russell died, her family discovered distressing material about suicide on her Instagram account However, some self-harm images will be allowed to remain on the Facebook-owned site. ""I might have an image of a scar or say, 'I'm 30 days clean,' and that's an important way to tell my story,"" Mr Mosseri said. ""That kind of content can still live on the site but the next change is that it won't show up in any recommendation services so it will be harder to find. ""It won't be in search, it won't be in hashtags, it won't be in recommendations."" When asked if he would resign if graphic self-harm content was still on the platform in six months, Mr Mosseri, 36, said: ""I will certainly have a long thought about how well I am doing in the role that I'm in.""

"Mobile phones should be banned from the dinner table and bedtimes as part of a healthy approach to devices, the UK's four chief medical officers have said. Children should also take a break from screen-based activities every two hours, the government advisers said. And they added industry must do more to keep children safe. Their guidance,externalcomes as English Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, is set to meet bosses at Instagram over the handling of self-harm and suicide content. Links have been made between the suicide of teenager Molly Russell and her exposure to harmful material on Instagram. Her father has said he believes the Facebook-owned platform""helped kill my daughter"". Tips on how to limit excessive screen time UK 'could ban' social media over suicide images After Molly Russell took her own life, her family discovered distressing material about suicide on her Instagram account Prof Dame Sally Davies, England's chief medical officer and the lead for the UK, said the case was ""tragic"" and it was clear some children were being exposed to inappropriate content. She told the BBC companies had a duty of care to help keep children safe and that age limits for using social media needed to be properly enforced and children should not be channelled towards harmful content - one of the key concerns in the Molly Russell case. But Dame Sally said a review of evidence had not proven a clear link between screen-based activities and mental health problems. And digital technologies could be a force for good, aiding online learning, socialising and helping people manage health conditions. There are several clear steps for parents, which the chief medical officers say will help keep children safe and healthy. These include: not using phones and mobile devices at the dinner table - talking as a family is very important for development keeping screens out of the bedroom at bedtime talking as a family about keeping safe online and about cyber-bulling and what children should do if they are worried not using phones when crossing a road or doing any other activity that requires a person's full attention making sure children take a break from screens every two hours by getting up and being active policing their own use too - parents should give their children proper attention and quality family time and never assume they are happy for pictures to be shared Dame Sally said a code of conduct was definitely needed. She wants to see technology companies invest in systems that properly vet the ages of users - a number of platforms require users to be 13 but these were not properly policed, she said. The guidance is also critical of what it calls ""persuasive design"". This refers to techniques used to encourage addictive behaviour, including collecting likes and rewards for performing actions such as sharing pictures. This video can not be played The design tricks that get you hooked on your phone Dame Sally also wants social media companies to develop better algorithms that push positive content to users. This has already been done for users who search for content that could potentially radicalise them. Instead of being fed material that promotes terrorism, users get content that aims to de-radicalise. Dame Sally said the same thing could happen when people searched for ""self-harm"" or ""suicide"". ""We would like to see content that promotes help-lines and where to go for support,"" she said. And she warned if industry did not act, ministers were likely to legislate to compel them. ""They need to sort themselves out - to safeguard our children,"" Dame Sally said. ""They have a duty of care - and if they don't, I expect the government will tell them how they will sort it."" Facebook welcomed the guidance and said it wanted young people to be safe online. It said it had introduced a new tool to help people see how much time they were spending on Facebook and Instagram, with daily reminders and a way to limit notifications. Twitter said it had introduced 70 changes in 2018 ""to make the service healthier and safer"". The chief medical officer used a team of academics to scour the research done on this issue. The academics said that, while some research had pointed to an association between screen-based activities and negative effects such as an increased risk of anxiety and depression, it was still inconclusive. It could be just that people who struggled with mental health problems were more likely to turn to their devices, Dame Sally said, rather than their habits being the root cause of the problems. Nonetheless, Dame Sally said, there needed to be a precautionary approach to this - until more research had been done - hence the guidance to parents. Dr Bernadka Dubicka, of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said the medical officers were right to be cautious. ""We do not yet have enough evidence to draw a definite link between screen time and mental health problems - but it is clear that some of the content that young people are viewing online, such as pro-anorexia, suicide and self-harming content, can be incredibly harmful,"" she said. The chief medical officers' guidance comes after leading paediatricians said last month thatparents should worry less about screen useafter a review found there was little evidence it was harmful in itself.

"This video can not be played Yellow Vests: Is the symbol spreading across Europe? A diplomatic row between France and Italy has deepened, with France complaining of ""unfounded attacks and outlandish claims"" by Italian leaders. France recalled its ambassador to Italy for talks on Thursday, saying the situation was ""unprecedented"" since the end of World War Two. It comes after Italian Deputy PM Luigi Di Maio met French ""yellow-vest"" protesters near Paris on Tuesday. France warned him not to interfere in the country's politics. Relations between the two countries - both founding members of the EU - have been tense since Italy's populist Five Star Movement and right-wing League party formed a coalition government in June 2018. The two governments have clashed over a range of issues, including immigration. The latest spat began after Mr Di Maio, the leader of Five Star Movement, met leaders of the anti-government ""gilets jaunes"" protests on Tuesday. He posted a picture of himself on Twitter with yellow-vest leader Christophe ChalenÃ§on and members of a yellow-vest list who are standing in elections to the European Parliament in May.

""For several months France has been the subject of repeated accusations, unfounded attacks and outlandish claims,"" the foreign ministry said on Thursday. ""The most recent interferences constitute an additional and unacceptable provocation. They violate the respect that is owed to democratic choices made by a nation which is a friend and an ally. To disagree is one thing, to exploit a relationship for electoral aims is another."" Luigi Di Maio tweeted that ""the wind of change has crossed the Alps"" Italy's fellow Deputy PM Matteo Salvini later said he would be happy to hold talks with President Emmanuel Macron. But to ""reset"" relations he said France had to address ""fundamental"" issues. He called on Paris to hand over left-wing militants wanted by Italy and to stop returning migrants. He also complained of lengthy French border checks causing traffic jams at the frontier. Mr Di Maio defended his decision to meet the protesters and described the French people as ""friends and allies"". ""President Macron has on several occasions attacked the Italian government for political reasons in view of the European elections. This has not affected the feeling of friendship that ties our two countries and never will,"" he said. Italian PM Giuseppe Conte, speaking on a visit to Beirut, said he hoped the situation could be ""cleared up immediately"". ""Italy and France's relationship is rooted in history and cannot be called into question by events,"" he said. France summons Italian envoy over Africa remarks Yellow vests face big decision as Macron fights back Mr Salvini launched a direct personal attack on Mr Macron last month, saying he hoped the French people would soon be able to ""free themselves of a terrible president"". Analysis by Paul Kirby, BBC News Online Europe editor The French have had enough of months of provocative words and acts emanating from Italy's two populist leaders. Even Italian diplomats are ""completely disoriented by this quarrel and just as surprised"" by the positions taken by Italy's ministers, according to Corriere della Sera columnist Massimo Franco. For France, the reason behind the spat is as clear as a bell. Matteo Salvini of the League and Five Star's Luigi Di Maio are simply electioneering ahead of the European Parliament elections in May. What has that got to do with France? Neither leader likes the pro-European Emmanuel Macron. For Mr Di Maio, the yellow vests challenging the French establishment are natural bedfellows, while the right-wing interior minister Mr Salvini finds common cause with President Macron's far-right rival Marine Le Pen. There may be votes in it, but there are big diplomatic risks too. The BBC's Hugh Schofield in Paris says the row represents a new low in a fast-deteriorating relationship. It is rare for one EU state to recall its ambassador to another. The recalling of any ambassador is usually the step before breaking off full diplomatic relations. In 2016Greece recalled its envoy to Austriain a row over the migrant crisis. Both Greece and Italy have expressed frustration at the reluctance of other EU states to take quotas of asylum seekers arriving on their shores. Christian Masset, France's ambassador to Italy, has been recalled for consultations In 2017 Hungary recalled its ambassador to the Netherlands over remarks made by the Dutch ambassador in which he drew parallels between Hungary's government and Islamic State militants. Much of the tension between France and Italy has been about migration. When France criticised Italy for not allowing rescue boats carrying migrants in the Mediterranean to dock, Italy responded by accusing France itself of refusing to accept migrants. Italy says France has sent migrants back across Italy's northern border. Italy complains that France returns migrants at border crossings, such as here at Ventimiglia In January, France summoned Italy's ambassador after Mr Di Maio said Paris had ""never stopped colonising tens of African states"". Also last month, Mr Salvini accused France of harbouring 14 ""terrorists"" wanted by Italy, after a fugitive ex-militant was extradited from Bolivia. France has also grown impatient with Italy over the building of a â¬8.6bn (Â£7.5bn) Lyon to Turin high-speed rail link which the Italian coalition partners cannot agree on. Matteo Salvini (centre right) backs the high-speed rail link through the Alps but the Five Star Movement wants it scrapped The protesters first took to the streets in November, angered by fuel tax increases. They said the measure hurt those who lived in remote areas of France and who depended on cars. This video can not be played France fuel protests: Who are the people in the yellow vests? The movement derives its name from the high-visibility yellow vests protesters wear - and which French motorists are required by law to carry in their vehicles. Who are the 'gilets jaunes'? But since their first marches - and the government's subsequent U-turn on fuel taxes - their demands have expanded to boosting people's purchasing power and allowing popular referendums. Mr Di Maio has found common cause with the protesters, urging them not to give up and offering them ""the support you need"".

"2017's Wonder Wheel was one of two Allen films released by Amazon Studios Woody Allen has launched legal action against Amazon Studios, accusing it of breaching their contract by refusing to distribute his latest film. The 83-year-old is seeking more than $68m (Â£52m) in damages, alleging the company backed out of a multi-picture deal without cause. Amazon released two of Allen's films and also distributed his TV series, Crisis in Six Scenes. But it dropped his most recent movie, A Rainy Day in New York. The BBC contacted Amazon Studios for comment, but did not receive an immediate reply. According to a lawsuit filed on Thursday,externalin New York, Allen claims Amazon backed out of the deal in June 2018 because of an old accusation that the director had molested his adopted daughter Dylan Farrow in 1992. The legal action said Amazon knew about ""a 25-year old, baseless"" allegation when it entered into deals with the director and that it ""does not provide a basis for Amazon to terminate the contract"". A Rainy Day in New York was shot in 2017 with a cast including Jude Law, Rebecca Hall, Selena Gomez and TimothÃ©e Chalamet. Moses Farrow defends Woody Allen Dylan Farrow: 'Allen's been lying so long' A number of its cast members have since distanced themselves from the project, with Chalamet announcing in 2018 he wouldgive his salary to charity.

"Flybe has warned shareholders it will wind up the company if they do not back a sale to a consortium led by Virgin Atlantic and Stobart Air. The airline said failure to approve a sale would mean investors were unlikely to get anything for their shares. The airline's board agreed the Â£2.2m sale to Connect Airways group last month, but the deal needs investor approval at a meeting on 4 March. Flybe acknowledged the offer of 1 penny per share was ""disappointingly low"". However, it said it was the only rescue plan on the table. In a statement on Thursday,external, Flybe said: ""If the [sale] scheme is not approved, the Flybe directors intend to take steps to wind-up the company and shareholders are likely to receive no value for their shares in Flybe."" Based in Exeter, Flybe carries about eight million passengers a year from airports such as Southampton, Cardiff and Aberdeen, to the UK and Europe. It put itself up for sale last November, following a profitswarning the previous month. Flybe said it had been ""hampered by the challenging market environment"". ""Ongoing fuel and currency impacts presented particularly significant headwinds for Flybe as did the rapid and significant tightening on Flybe's liquidity from the card acquirer market."" In addition, it said, the ""general economic outlook and conditions had impacted the business leading to a further weakening in consumer demand, affecting cash, revenues and profit adversely"". It agreed to sell the parent company to Connect on 11 January. However, on 15 January, to avoid the airline going into administration the Flybe board entered into a separate agreement to sell the operating subsidiaries - the airline and the website - to Connect Airways for Â£2.8m. That sale is expected to be competed by 22 February, and does not require shareholder approval. Once it is complete, however, the parent company will not have any subsidiaries or assets other than cash from the sale of the operating assets. The directors said it was not anticipated that after meeting costs there will be ""any remaining funds available for distribution to Flybe shareholders"". The directors said as a result if the shareholders did not approve the initial sale of the parent company, they would wind up the business. Therefore, the directors said they ""strongly"" advised Flybe shareholders to vote in favour of the sale of the parent company in order to receive any money at all.

"Jaguar Land Rover booked a loss for the last three months of 2018 as sales collapsed in China. The company booked a Â£3.1bn reduction in the value of its plants and other investments leading to a Â£3.4bn quarterly loss, its biggest to date. Carmakers are being hit by stronger regulations and demand for cleaner models. Sales for the quarter were Â£6.2bn, down from Â£6.3bn a year earlier. It sold 144,602 vehicles, down from 154,447. Jaguar chief executive Ralf Speth said: ""Jaguar Land Rover reported strong third-quarter sales in the UK and North America, but our overall performance continued to be impacted by challenging market conditions in China."" Excluding the write-down, which affects its balance sheet but has no effect on cash, the company posted a loss of Â£273m. Much of the firm's model range is currently diesel-powered, while diesel sales in Europe have been falling. Jaguar Land Rover, which is owned by India's Tata Motors, has embarked on a major restructuring programme to prepare for the future and boost profitability.

"2017's Wonder Wheel was one of two Allen films released by Amazon Studios Woody Allen has launched legal action against Amazon Studios, accusing it of breaching their contract by refusing to distribute his latest film. The 83-year-old is seeking more than $68m (Â£52m) in damages, alleging the company backed out of a multi-picture deal without cause. Amazon released two of Allen's films and also distributed his TV series, Crisis in Six Scenes. But it dropped his most recent movie, A Rainy Day in New York. The BBC contacted Amazon Studios for comment, but did not receive an immediate reply. According to a lawsuit filed on Thursday,externalin New York, Allen claims Amazon backed out of the deal in June 2018 because of an old accusation that the director had molested his adopted daughter Dylan Farrow in 1992. The legal action said Amazon knew about ""a 25-year old, baseless"" allegation when it entered into deals with the director and that it ""does not provide a basis for Amazon to terminate the contract"". A Rainy Day in New York was shot in 2017 with a cast including Jude Law, Rebecca Hall, Selena Gomez and TimothÃ©e Chalamet. Moses Farrow defends Woody Allen Dylan Farrow: 'Allen's been lying so long' A number of its cast members have since distanced themselves from the project, with Chalamet announcing in 2018 he wouldgive his salary to charity. Last year Lawtold Vanity Fair,externalit was ""a terrible shame"" the film had been shelved and that he would ""have to consider carefully"" before ever working with Allen again.

"The two stars discussed songwriting and comedy during the show Forty years ago, two of music's biggest stars walked into BBC Radio 1 and sat down to review the week's new releases. Michael Jackson and George Harrison spent the next 90 minutes discussing singles by Foreigner, Nicolette Larson and The Blues Brothers, as well as the stories behind their own songs. The BBC discarded the show, keeping only a short clip. But now a rare recording has been found and restored. Excerpts will be broadcastin a special documentarythis weekend. Listeners will hear Jackson, just months before releasing Off The Wall, discuss how Motown refused to let him write his own music; while Harrison explains what it was like to work in the songwriting shadow of Lennon and McCartney. At one point, Jackson turns to the former Beatle and says: ""Let me ask you a question, did you guys always write your own stuff from the beginning?"" The guitarist replies: ""Well, John and Paul wrote right from before we ever made a record."" Jackson seems taken aback, asking: ""How did you manage that?"" ""I don't know,"" drawls Harrison. ""They were clever little fellows."" This video can not be played Michael Jackson and George Harrison were interviewed by David ""Kid"" Jensen The atmosphere sounds relaxed and good-humoured throughout, and the two musicians take the task of reviewing the songs seriously, although at one point Harrison confesses: ""To tell you the truth, I've no idea what is a hit and what isn't a hit these days."" The programme was part of a long-running Radio 1 series called Roundtable, which was presented in 1979 by David ""Kid"" Jensen. ""They were both lovely guys to talk to,"" he recalls of Jackson and Harrison. ""We knew we had a good show on our hands, just by the general vibe in the studio before the mics went live. ""It was like Juke Box Jury - people judging their peers. In the case of the Beatles and Michael Jackson, of course, it's not quite their peers but certainly [people] in the same line of business."" Although the broadcaster ranked the encounter as one of his favourite ever interviews, the BBC erased the programme and, for years, only low-quality bootleg recordings were available. That was until Richard Latto, a producer at BBC Radio Solent, set about trying to find a complete copy. ""I put the word out on the collectors' circuit and a chap called Richard White came forward with a cassette recording of the entire broadcast,"" he says. ""This was fantastic news because the BBC only held a short, four-minute extract from the show, which is tiny when compared to the [full] programme, which contains some very special moments that were thought to be lost forever."" There was a relaxed atmosphere in the studio, despite hundreds of fans queuing outside However, restoring the audio to a listenable standard was ""a tremendous challenge"", he explains. ""There's aclip on the internet which is barely audible,externaland gives you an idea of the challenge we faced. We spent hours sharpening and polishing the raw sound, which was recorded in 1979 off an AM radio during the hours of darkness, so plagued by lots of hiss and distortion. ""After extensive work, we were able to get the voices of the legendary stars and Kid to cut through with fantastic clarity."" The results will be broadcast on BBC Radio Solent on Saturday, 9 February, the 40th anniversary of the original broadcast. It will reveal why Jackson wore a pith helmet throughout the recording and how Harrison took a year off music to ""go to the races"". On the tape, they review Foreigner's Blue Morning Blue Day (""It gets your attention"" - Jackson) and Lenny White's cover of Lady Madonna (""I prefer the Fab Four's version"" - Harrison). The former Beatle discusses the merits of cover versions and discloses how he'd written the Beatles' classic Something with Ray Charles in mind. ""As it happened, the song ended up with over 150 cover versions,"" he says. ""But when Ray Charles did it, I was really disappointed. It was a bit corny, the way he did it."" ""You wrote Something?"" exclaims Jackson. ""Ohhhh, I didn't know that. I thought Lennon and McCartney did that."" ""Yeah,"" Harrison replies. ""Everybody thinks that."" When George Met Michael will be broadcast onBBC Radio Solentat 11:00 GMT on Saturday, 9 February; after which it will be available for 30 dayson BBC Sounds.

"This video can not be played Equine flu: Inside the Newmarket laboratory that detected the outbreak Horse racing will not resume in Britain until Wednesday, 13 February at the earliest after an outbreak of equine flu, the British Horseracing Authority has announced. All fixtures on Thursday werecalled off by the BHAafter three vaccinated horses tested positive for the disease. Trainer Donald McCain has confirmed the horses came from his Cheshire stables. Horses from the infected yard raced on Wednesday, potentially exposing a significant number of horses. ""This precautionary approach is intended to ensure we put the health of the horse population and control of the virus first, and avoid any unnecessary risk that might come from returning to racing too quickly,"" said a BHA statement. ""We appreciate the impact that this may have on the sport commercially, but disease control in order to mitigate the risk of further disruption to the sport - and safeguard the health and welfare of our horses - must be a priority."" The meetings at Chelmsford, Doncaster, Ffos Las and Huntingdon on Thursday were cancelled. Racing had been due to take place at Bangor, Kempton Park, Newcastle and Southwell on Friday. On Saturday, Lingfield, Newbury, Uttoxeter, Warwick and Wolverhampton were on the schedule, with Exeter, Musselburgh and Southwell hosting events on Sunday. Musselburgh cancellation 'a real shame' This announcement also means the Monday races at Catterick, Hereford and Wolverhampton will not go ahead, nor will the fixtures on Tuesday at Ayr, Lingfield and Newcastle. The statement added: ""The BHA's veterinary team has today been in contact with more than 50 trainers and veterinarians to allow it to make an informed assessment of the risk of equine influenza spreading. ""While no further positive tests have been received, at least three more days are required before it will be possible to make a decision about whether it is safe to resume racing. ""The disease can take up to three days before symptoms are visible, meaning it will take until Sunday at the earliest before the BHA can gather all the information required. ""This approach will allow samples to be collected and assessed by the Animal Health Trust in order that a fully informed decision can be made on Monday. This may then allow declarations to take place on Tuesday in time for racing on Wednesday."" Doncaster was one of the fixtures called off on Thursday In a statement issued through the National Trainers Federation, McCain said: ""I have been aware of the recent news about equine influenza outbreaks in France and Ireland, and over the last couple of days, I have been concerned about the health status of a small number of horses in the yard. ""Their welfare is at the front of our minds, so at my request our veterinary surgeon has examined them regularly and we have followed his advice on testing and treatment. ""It was by following this protocol that the positive results for equine flu came to light yesterday evening. ""The BHA were contacted immediately and we are liaising closely with them about bio-security and management of all the horses at Bankhouse. Bankhouse follows all the available advice on disease control and all our horses are fully inoculated."" He added: ""We are scrupulous about observing the health status of horses in our care and taking the necessary steps to treat any condition that may affect them. It follows we would never race any horses that we could have known were infected. This video can not be played Welsh trainer Tim Vaughan describes the equine flu outbreak as 'quite frightening' ""Over the last two months, all potential runners have been scoped and their blood checked within 36 hours of their races to ensure that only healthy horses compete for the yard. ""When new horses arrive at our yard we, as much as possible, try to keep them separate but at this stage cannot know if the infection came from recent arrivals or from horses returning from racing. ""We have three confirmed cases and this morning have taken blood and swabs from all the others for testing."" David Sykes, director of equine health and welfare at the BHA, added: ""We would like to thank Donald McCain for his co-operation in this matter, and for the responsible manner in which he has dealt with this issue, under the guidance of his veterinary surgeon. ""He has acted professionally with the interests of the racing industry and the health of his horses as his priority."" Cornelius Lysaght, BBC horse racing correspondent This is a dramatic turn of events. The sport had been hoping that tests carried out would be sufficiently reassuring for racing to resume quickly. The good news is that no new cases have been discovered, but the science says the virus can take up to three days to be identified so that takes us to Sunday. If an all-clear is then given, it will then take a couple of days of admin to get things back together. Health and welfare is paramount, of course, but so near to the Cheltenham Festival, this couldn't have happened at a worse time and it will be hoped that Saturday at Newbury can be re-arranged.

"Pilcher published her first novel under her own name in 1955 Rosamunde Pilcher, author of The Shell Seekers, has died at the age of 94 following a short illness, her agent has confirmed. The novelist penned nearly 30 romance and women's fiction books between 1949 and 2000 when she retired from writing. Born on the north coast of Cornwall, Pilcher began writing at the age of seven and published her first short story at 18. She once described her books as ""frightfully wet little novels"". When she began writing for Mills & Boon in the late 1940s, her stories were published under the pseudonym Jane Fraser. Her first novel as Rosamunde Pilcher, A Secret to Tell, was published in 1955. The Shell Seekers, considered one of her most famous works, was published in 1988. It centres on Penelope Keeling, an elderly British woman who reflects on her life and her relationships with her adult children. The book won her international recognition, becoming one of her biggest successes and selling more than five million copies worldwide. Her books inspired the Four Seasons miniseries in 2008 In 1989 it became the best-selling book in America, the same year Angela Lansbury starred in a TV adaptation. By the mid 1990s, it was reported that Pilcher was one of the highest-earning women in Britain. In 2003 The Shell Seekers was nominated by the British public as one of the top 100 novels in the BBC's Big Read. It was also adapted into a stage play in 2005 and a mini-series starring Vanessa Redgrave in 2006. Pilcher's novels and short stories are especially popular in Germany, where the national TV station ZDF has adapted her works into more than 100 films. The author's romanticised outlook on Cornwall became a fixture in German pop culture and led to many German tourists visiting the British coast to experience the quaint and quintessentially British world Pilcher had created. This led her to winning a British Tourism Award in 2002. Follow us onFacebook,external, on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external, or on Instagram atbbcnewsents,external.

"Flybe has warned shareholders it will wind up the company if they do not back a sale to a consortium led by Virgin Atlantic and Stobart Air. The airline said failure to approve a sale would mean investors were unlikely to get anything for their shares. The airline's board agreed the Â£2.2m sale to Connect Airways group last month, but the deal needs investor approval at a meeting on 4 March. Flybe acknowledged the offer of 1 penny per share was ""disappointingly low"". However, it said it was the only rescue plan on the table. In a statement on Thursday,external, Flybe said: ""If the [sale] scheme is not approved, the Flybe directors intend to take steps to wind-up the company and shareholders are likely to receive no value for their shares in Flybe."" Based in Exeter, Flybe carries about eight million passengers a year from airports such as Southampton, Cardiff and Aberdeen, to the UK and Europe. It put itself up for sale last November, following a profitswarning the previous month. Flybe said it had been ""hampered by the challenging market environment"". ""Ongoing fuel and currency impacts presented particularly significant headwinds for Flybe as did the rapid and significant tightening on Flybe's liquidity from the card acquirer market."" In addition, it said, the ""general economic outlook and conditions had impacted the business leading to a further weakening in consumer demand, affecting cash, revenues and profit adversely"". It agreed to sell the parent company to Connect on 11 January. However, on 15 January, to avoid the airline going into administration the Flybe board entered into a separate agreement to sell the operating subsidiaries - the airline and the website - to Connect Airways for Â£2.8m. That sale is expected to be competed by 22 February, and does not require shareholder approval. Once it is complete, however, the parent company will not have any subsidiaries or assets other than cash from the sale of the operating assets. The directors said it was not anticipated that after meeting costs there will be ""any remaining funds available for distribution to Flybe shareholders"". The directors said as a result if the shareholders did not approve the initial sale of the parent company, they would wind up the business. Therefore, the directors said they ""strongly"" advised Flybe shareholders to vote in favour of the sale of the parent company in order to receive any money at all.

"The Hawker Hunter jet plane pictured prior to plummeting on to the A27 The standard of flying by the pilot of a jet which crashed during the Shoreham Airshow was ""about as negligent as you can get"", a court has heard. Andrew Hill, 54, faces 11 counts of manslaughter after failing to pull out of a loop manoeuvre in August 2015. Jurors previously heard the move was executed at too low an altitude. Jonathon Whaley, an experienced air display pilot and evaluator, told the Old Bailey that was a ""fundamental thing"" and you ""do not do it"". Prosecutor Tom Kark QC asked how far Mr Hill's flying fell below acceptable standards, assuming he was not suffering a physical impairment. Mr Whaley replied: ""He had all the training, all the knowledge to know that he hadn't achieved his gate height, and none of the parameters were correct to complete safely this manoeuvre. ""To me that is about as negligent as you can get in terms of flying."" Andrew Hill survived the crash but his barrister says his client does not remember what happened Giving evidence, Mr Whaley said he did not permit looping manoeuvres in the Hawker Hunter he flies. Defending Mr Hill, Karim Khalil QC asked: ""It can be thought of as inherently dangerous?"" Mr Whaley agreed it could, but acknowledged the manoeuvre was authorised to be carried out in displays. ""The profession of aerobatic display does carry inherent dangers?"" Mr Khalil asked. ""It does carry inherent dangers which is why the pilot has to be aware of them,"" Mr Whaley replied. Mr Whaley was asked why he and other experts had said Mr Hill's display at the 2015 Shoreham Airshow contained ""no difficult manoeuvres"". He answered: ""I said it needed arguably more concentration, but I accept that if it's well flown then it's not a problem."" Mr Khalil asked him if Mr Hill may have become ""fixated"" on the road mid-stunt when he realised ""things were not looking good"". ""If you've got something like that in front of you I could imagine that becomes a focus of your concentration, not looking left or right,"" Mr Whaley replied. ""This is when it's becoming apparent that things aren't going well."" Emergency services on the A27 in the aftermath of the crash After turning upside down, the Cold War-era jet fighter descended vertically towards the ground, the court heard. Mr Hill tried to keep the plane in the air, but it came down on top of the busy A27 near Shoreham Airport. Earlier the judge reminded the jury Mr Whaley was simply giving an opinion on the matter. Mr Justice Edis said: ""It will be up to you to decide to accept what the expert said, whether you prefer another expert, or you don't accept any of them. ""It's only an answer, not the answer."" Mr Hill, of Sandon in Hertfordshire, denies all charges. Mr Khalil previously told the court that due to injuries sustained in the crash, Mr Hill cannot remember what happened. He claims Mr Hill was affected by something like G-force, which reduces blood supply to the brain. The trial continues.

"Artwork: Hayabusa2 arrived at the asteroid Ryugu in June last year The Japanese spacecraft Hayabusa 2 will attempt to collect a sample of rock from an asteroid on 22 February, the country's space agency (Jaxa) says. Hayabusa 2 reached asteroid Ryugu in June 2018 after a three-and-a-half-year journey from Earth. It will descend to the surface and attempt to grab the sample from a pre-chosen site. The spacecraft will return to Earth with the samples in 2020 after its exploration of Ryugu is complete. Jaxa officials had to delay the touchdown last October, after they found the asteroid's surface was more rugged than expected. During sample collection, the spacecraft will approach the 1km-wide asteroid with an instrument called the sampler horn. On touchdown, a 5g projectile made of the metal tantalum is fired into the rocky surface at 300m/s. The particles kicked up by the impact will be caught by a specially-designed section of the sampler horn. Hayabusa 2 will begin descending to the surface on 21 February (local time) and should touch down around 08:00 on the 22nd. Japanese spacecraft reaches cosmic 'diamond' Japanese rovers touch down on asteroid The asteroid 162173 Ryugu is thought to be of a particularly primitive type In September, Hayabusa 2 deployed two robotic ""hoppers"" that propelled themselves across the surface of Ryugu, sending back images and other data. Then, in October, the ""mothership"" despatched a French-German instrument package called Mascot to the surface. Later this year, perhaps in March or April, Jaxa plans to detonate an explosive charge that will punch a crater into the surface of Ryugu. Hayabusa-2 would then descend into the crater to collect fresh samples of material that have not been altered by aeons of exposure to the environment of space. New asteroid rover images released Japan puts another 'rover' on asteroid Ryugu belongs to a particularly primitive type of asteroid, and is therefore a relic left over from the early days of our Solar System. The sample collection operations should allow scientists in labs on Earth to study the material, shedding light on the origin and evolution of our own planet. The 30 billion-yen mission is the successor to another Jaxa asteroid explorer, Hayabusa, which means ""peregrine falcon"" in Japanese. This earlier mission was launched in 2003 and reached the asteroid Itokawa in 2005.

"This video can not be played Bank of England Governor, Mark Carney The Bank of England expects growth this year to be the slowest since 2009 when the economy was in recession. It is forecasting growth of 1.2% this year, down from its previous forecast of 1.7% made in November. The Bank said it had seen further evidence that businesses were being cautious in the run-up to Brexit, including evidence from its own survey of firms. As expected the Bank kept interest rates on hold at 0.75%. The Bank put the fall in growth down to a decline in business investment and housebuilding, as well as a halving of the growth rate in exports. The UK was also being hit by slower-than-expected growth in the eurozone and China,the Bank said in its Quarterly Inflation Report.,external ""Growth appears to have slowed at the end of 2018 and is expected to remain subdued in the near term,"" it said. The Bank even sees a one-in-four chance of the economy slipping into recession in the second half of this year. Brexit stalemate scars prosperity, says Bank There has been an ""intensification"" of Brexit uncertainties, the Bank said. Its survey of 208 firms showed that half had started putting plans in place for a no-deal Brexit. The survey also showed that a fifth had taken on extra warehouse space It also noted a sharp fall in business investment at the end of last year. ""Uncertainty appears to have risen recently, and may have weighed on investment by more than had been expected in August,"" the Bank said. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said: ""The fog of Brexit is causing short term volatility in the economic data, and more fundamentally, it is creating a series of tensions in the economy, tensions for business."" Interest rates remain at 0.75%, where they have been since the Bank of England last raised in interest rates in August. Many economists think that once the uncertainty over Brexit is lifted then the economy will accelerate and the Bank will have to raise interest rates to stop it overheating. However, recent economic data has indicated weakness in the UK economy. Growth in the service sector, the biggest part of the economy, appeared to have stalled in January,according to closely-watched survey of purchasing managers. Samuel Tombs, an economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, predicts that the Bank will raise rates once this year and twice in 2020. Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said: ""We still think that a decent rebound in GDP growth, should a Brexit deal be reached, will result in interest rates rising further than the Bank and the financial markets assume."" Moves in interest rates are important to the 3.5 million people with variable or tracker mortgages. Even a small rise of 0.25% can add hundreds of pounds to their annual mortgage costs. ""It's a very good time for people looking to borrow,"" said Andrew Montlake, a director at Coreco, a mortgage broker. He said there had been a lot of competition among lenders in January, with some very good deals for five-year fixed mortgage deals. Some lenders are offering five-year fixed deals at below 2%, he said. Concern over Brexit has held back some people from borrowing. ""There is a lot of pent-up demand,"" said Mr Montlake. Savers who depend on higher interest rates to boost their incomes will be disappointed that rates have stayed on hold for a sixth consecutive month. While the Bank cut its growth forecast it also noted the strength of the labour market, where the unemployment rate is currently 4%. The rate at which people are switching to new jobs is only slightly below the level hit before the financial crisis of 2007. That switching suggests that employers are having to compete to attract staff, the Bank said. It also noted a pick-up in the average number of hours worked at the end of last year and firmer wage growth. The Bank thinks that wage growth will increase in the coming years as the UK's unemployment rate continues to fall. The main reason the Bank thinks underlying inflation pressures will grow is that wage growth will rise. Britain's unemployment rate has hit its lowest level in more than 40 years. The Bank predicts that earnings will rise by more than 3% a year over the next three years.

"This video can not be played Theresa May: ""I am clear that I am going to deliver Brexit, deliver it on time."" Theresa May has told EU leaders she can get the Brexit deal through Parliament if they give her legally-binding changes to it. The UK prime minister - who also vowed to deliver Brexit ""on time"" - was speaking after a series of meetings with top EU officials in Brussels. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker again ruled out the kind of changes Mrs May wants to see. But the two sides agreed to further talks to break the deadlock.

Mrs May said she had ""set out very clearly the position from Parliament that we must have legally binding changes to the withdrawal agreement in order to deal with Parliament's concerns over the backstop"". That, ""together with the other work that we're doing on workers' rights and other issues, will deliver a stable majority in Parliament,"" she said. Mr Juncker ""underlined that the EU27 will not reopen the withdrawal agreement"" in their talks, according to a joint statement released by the two sides. But he ""expressed his openness"" to adding words to the non-binding future relationship document - that also has to be backed by MPs - to be ""more ambitious in terms of content and speed"". Did anything change? Not that much. But for Downing Street, this has not been a pointless stop-off in the almost never-ending Brexit adventure. Because, while there hasn't been a breakthrough, the EU has agreed to more talks, which at least opens up the possibility of discussing the changes to the troubled backstop that has caused such political difficulty. It might not sound like much, but ""we can talk"", is at least a different message to ""this is over"" . Read more from Laura Meanwhile, Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay and EU negotiator Michel Barnier will hold talks in Strasbourg on Monday, as the EU and UK Brexit negotiating teams discuss proposed changes to the deal. Downing Street said these talks would cover ""alternative arrangements"" for the Irish border, as called for by MPs in a vote last week. A spokeswoman said other UK ministers, such as Attorney General Geoffrey Cox could be involved. Mr Cox is ""working on working on possible ways in which legal texts could be drafted, that gave effect to the objective we want,"" Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington told the BBC. Mrs May and Mr Juncker will meet again before the end of February, to review progress. The prime minister is expected to put the deal to a vote in the Commons towards the end of February. Jeremy Corbyn has listed five demands, including a UK-wide customs union Jeremy Corbyn has written to the prime minister setting out his party's price for supporting a Brexit deal and to offer talks to secure ""a sensible agreement that can win the support of Parliament and bring the country together"". The Labour leader's five demands include a ""permanent and comprehensive UK-wide customs union"" aligned with the EU's customs rules but with an agreement ""that includes a UK say on future EU trade deals"". Mr Corbyn also wants close alignment with the EU single market and ""dynamic alignment on rights and protections"" for workers so that UK standards do not fall behind those of the EU. He also proposes participation in EU agencies and funding programmes, and agreements on security and keeping access to the European Arrest Warrant. The letter does not mention previous demands that any deal must deliver the ""exact same benefits"" that membership of the single market and customs union currently does - effectively scrapping the party's ""six tests"" that had been its Brexit policy. The BBC's Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg said Labour's shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer would be meeting Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington to discuss the proposals. Owen Smith says he and others are thinking of quitting Labour But the move was met with dismay by Labour members of the People's Vote campaign for another EU referendum, who accused Mr Corbyn of going back on his commitment, made at the party's conference, to back a public vote if he can't force a general election. Labour MP Owen Smith, who made a failed leadership bid in 2016, has told the BBC he and others were thinking of quitting the party over Mr Corbyn's Brexit stance. But Labour's Stephen Kinnock, who backs the ""Norway Plus"" model of a close economic partnership with the EU, welcomed Mr Corbyn's letter, tweeting: ""This can break the deadlock."" Mr Lidington said he and Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay would be willing to discuss Labour's proposals with Sir Keir and other frontbenchers. But he said Labour's call to have a say in trade deals while being in a customs union with the EU was ""wishful thinking"", because Brussels had ruled it out. The European Parliament's Brexit co-ordinator Guy Verhofstadt welcomed Mr Corbyn's proposals, saying ""the broadest possible majority"" was needed for a Brexit deal in the UK and ""cross-party co-operation is the way forward"". It was also backed by Conservative MP Sir Oliver Letwin, who wants to see the UK in a Norway-style relationship with the EU after Brexit. Allow Twitter content?

MP Smith 'considering' quitting Labour What is Labour's customs union policy? Brexit deal: Drive to win Labour support Brexit: A really simple guide The UK is due to leave the EU at 23:00 GMT on Friday 29 March, when the two-year time limit on withdrawal negotiations enforced by the Article 50 process expires. In January, MPs overwhelmingly rejected the withdrawal deal that the government had negotiated with the EU, backing an amendment for the government to seek ""alternative arrangements"" to the backstop. The backstop is an ""insurance policy"" designed to avoid ""under all circumstances"" the return of customs checkpoints between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic after Brexit.

But the Democratic Unionist Party and Brexiteers believe the proposed temporary single customs arrangement could threaten the integrity of the UK, leaving it bound by EU rules if no trade deal is agreed.

"This video can not be played Molly Russell's father told the BBC he believed Instagram had 'helped kill my daughter' Harmful suicide and self-harm content online ""has the effect of grooming people to take their own lives"", the suicide prevention minister has said. Jackie Doyle-Price has told the BBC that social media companies must ""step up"" to protect vulnerable users. It comes after links were made between thesuicide of teenager Molly Russelland her exposure to harmful content. The government is to roll out new laws to remove illegal content and protect vulnerable people later this year. Digital Minister Margot James promised to crack down on many of the social media platforms that have ""fallen short"" in their response to online bullying, abuse and misinformation. In a speech at a conference for Safer Internet Day, Ms James said: ""We will soon be publishing an Online Harms White Paper which will set out clear expectations for companies to help keep their users, particularly children, safe online. ""We will introduce laws that force social media platforms to remove illegal content, and to prioritise the protection of users beyond their commercial interests."" Meanwhile Ms Doyle-Price was due to meet Facebook on Tuesday to discuss what action it is taking. She told BBC Breakfast: ""We want social media not really to be doing this through the stick of the law, we want them to do it to look after their users."" She said she hoped senior staff at Facebook, which also owns Instagram, would act - ideally using algorithms to protect people rather than ""bombard"" them with advertising. Ms Doyle-Price said: ""Sometimes they do [act], but more often they don't"".

""They shouldn't wait for government to tell them what to do. It says a lot about the values of companies if they do not take action voluntarily."" Speaking to the BBC, she said: ""We could use fines, we could make social media companies much more responsible and apply the full force of the law to them if we feel they are being negligent in their duty of care to their users."" The Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) and the Home Office are due to publish a white paper on the government's approach to online safety later this year. A family photo of Molly, taken in 2009 Ms Doyle-Price said the father of Molly Russell, who took her own life in 2017 aged 14, had done much to highlight the issue. ""I am full of admiration for Molly's father for being so brave and frank,"" she said. Molly's father, Ian Russell, told the BBC he believed Instagram had ""helped kill my daughter"". When her family looked at her Instagram account after her death, they found distressing material about depression and suicide. Ms Doyle-Price said that after Mr Russell spoke out, ""so many other parents have spoken out...it has really focused people's minds"". She added: ""The really shocking thing is that he had absolutely no idea that his daughter was looking at these things online."" The boss of Instagram,Adam Mosseri, is due to meet the health secretarythis week over the platform's handling of content promoting self-harm and suicide. Writing in the Daily Telegraph,external, he said Molly's case had left him ""deeply moved"" and he accepted the site had work to do. He wrote: ""We rely heavily on our community to report this content, and remove it as soon as it's found.

At the age of 12, Libby, became ""hooked"" on posting and viewing self-harm images on Instagram - including pictures of cutting, burning and overdosing.

"Legal professionals have warned cuts ""threaten the quality of justice"" Legal advice could be given in GP surgeries to address issues which could exacerbate mental health problems, the Ministry of Justice has said. The move was announced as part of the government review of legal aid reforms - introduced in England and Wales in 2013 to cut the Â£2bn budget by Â£350m. The MoJ said legal aid would receive up to Â£8m extra to support its services. The Bar Council, which represents barristers in England and Wales, said reforms offered ""little of substance"". The review follows the significant changes made to civil legal aid in 2013, which meant some types of case were no longer eligible for public funds - including family, welfare, housing and debt. The MoJ said more face-to-face advice would be provided for social welfare claimants. Legal aid could also be provided in GP surgeries as part of an ""early intervention"" pilot scheme. Justice minister Lucy Frazer said having legal advisers in GP surgeries would mean they could ""nip the problem in the bud"" by helping with housing and benefits problems that may be ""exacerbating"" mental health issues. After looking into the impact of the reforms, the MoJ said up to Â£5m would be spent in ""developing innovative technologies"" to help people access legal support. It also pledged a further Â£3m to be invested over two years to help those representing themselves in the court system. What impact have legal aid cuts had? Legal aid network 'decimated' by cuts Ms Frazer said: ""We are emphasising the need for new technologies and new ideas to catch people early, before their problems escalate to the courtroom."" By legal affairs correspondent Clive Coleman The effects of the 2013 cuts were stark - including a steep rise in people having to conduct their own cases and clogging up the courts. One judge told me of a case involving two litigants in person, neither of whom had English as a first language, who both turned up to court with carrier bags full of documents. A case which should have taken two days with lawyers, took two weeks. The long-awaited review and action plan have been given a cautious welcome by some lawyers groups, but others see it as a sticking plaster on a gaping wound. But the critical factor in fixing the current system lies in the overall funding that the Ministry of Justice is able to secure from the Treasury. It needs to be sufficient to ensure that those who need and deserve legal aid to protect and defend their rights, get it. Richard Atkins QC, chair of the Bar Council, said the council was ""disappointed"" by the report, which offered ""little of substance"" to ease the impact of the reforms ""on vulnerable individuals seeking justice"". However, Law Society president Christina Blacklaws said the review was a move in the right direction. She said: ""We hope these changes will make it easier for ordinary people to qualify for legal aid and access essential help and support."" David Isaac, chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, also welcomed the steps taken by the MoJ. He said: ""Bringing back face-to-face advice will significantly help those who have faced discrimination seek justice and will be particularly beneficial for many disabled people and those with limited English language skills. The Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 (LASPO) withdrew aid from many areas of law and led to widespread criticism. It also lowered the means test and scrapped automatic eligibility for those in receipt of means-tested benefits. A BBC investigation in December found that cuts to legal aid had created ""deserts""of provision across England and Wales. Solicitors working on legal aid contracts said they had to turn people away ""every single day"", but there was no longer anywhere to send them.

"The number of fatal stabbings in England and Wales last year was the highest since records began in 1946, official figures show. There were 285 killings by a knife or sharp instrument in the 12 months ending March 2018,Office for National Statistics analysis shows,external. The ONS says one in four (71) of all victims (285) were men aged 18-24. The figures also show 25% of victims were black - the highest proportion since data was first collected in 1997. The figures show a 45% increase in the number of victims aged 16-24 and a 23% increase in those aged 25-34. While gun crime was lower than 10 years ago,it was at its highest for a decade in four English counties- West Yorkshire, Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Cheshire. Suspects convicted of all 252 killings in the year to March 2018, were most likely to be aged 16-24 The worst place for killings in the UK, proportionately, was in Inverclyde, Scotland There were 132 people killed in London -the highest for 10 yearsif you exclude those killed in terror attacks However, this means there were 6.6 homicides per 100,000 people in the capital, compared with 14 per 100,000 in Inverclyde Two London boroughs were named in the 10 worst places for killings In Scotland,latest official figures for 2017-18,externalshow the number of all killings fell by six to to 59 - its joint lowest level since 1976 Police Scotland figures show a knife or sharp instrument was used in 34 of them Twenty eight of these victims were male and the victims were most likely to be aged 31-50 The latest figures for Scotland are expected to be published in October 2019 This video can not be played Teach kids the realities of knife crime A third of female victims were killed by partners or ex-partners, compared with 1% of male victims Of male victims, 35% were killed by a stranger, compared with 17% of female victims One in four men were killed by friends or acquaintances, compared with 7% of female victims By home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw The figures on homicide do not generally vary hugely from year-to-year, which is why the steep increase in fatal stabbings to an all-time high is particularly striking. It provides further evidence that knife crime is arguably the greatest law enforcement challenge facing the Home Office, police and communities across England and Wales. Ministers have blamed much of the rise in serious violence on disputes between drug gangs. The figures provide some support for this with a slight increase in drug-related killings: 44% now compared with 40% in 2008. In the past two years, 58% of suspects and 35% of victims were dealers or users. However, drugs are unlikely to account for the entire rise in cases of murder and manslaughter which, as a proportion of population, is back to levels it was a decade ago but not as high as in the early 2000s.

" Most surrogate mothers have already given birth at least once, so Thida is unusual. In her early 20s and married to a repairman in a village outside Phnom Penh, she could never afford to have children. But if she earned $10,000 by giving birth to a foreigner’s child everything would change; by becoming a surrogate mother she would have enough money to start her own family. So when a representative from a surrogacy agency visited her village she put her name forward - and was accepted. “If I had known it was illegal, I would never have done it,” Thida says. In fact, by the time the fertilised egg from a Chinese couple was implanted in her womb, at the end of 2017, commercial surrogacy had already been banned for more than a year, but the ban had only recently begun to be enforced. Once pregnant, Thida was taken to a crowded villa in the capital’s expensive Russey Keo district. Soon there were 32 other pregnant mothers there, living five to a room. “The rooms were so small there was no space to walk,” she says. Those who were heavily pregnant wanted to pace up and down, but there was no room - and they weren’t allowed outside. He is my first child, I really love him so much Then in June the police pounced. First employees of the surrogacy agency were taken away and charged with trafficking. Before long, the mothers were also charged, apart from one - a Thai woman - who was deported. Thida started feeling contractions late one night in October, and was taken to hospital by ambulance the following morning. When the baby was born, Thida was eager to see his face, so the doctor put him on her chest for five minutes before taking him away to be cleaned. “He is my first child, I really love him so much,” she says. “I felt awful that he came into the world and was imprisoned in the police hospital with me for months.” A dozen women who had already delivered their babies were put in a big room, with hammocks for beds. By bribing the guards, Thida’s mother-in-law, Sre-Oun, was able to make regular visits, bringing nappies, fruit and powdered milk. The mothers had not been fed well enough to breastfeed, she says. Then, three days after the birth, the baby’s Chinese parents arrived. Thida caught a glimpse of the wife from the hospital window. The father gave a hospital guard a $100 bribe and entered the ward with a Khmer translator. “He held the baby and cried like his heart was broken,” says Thida. “I really felt so sorry for him.” He spent 20 minutes with his son, then rejoined his wife outside. The meeting was so frantic that Thida didn’t exchange phone numbers with him. Then in December, Thida and the boy were allowed to go home. Before leaving, Thida and the other mothers were told that they must raise the children until their 18th birthday or face up to 20 years in jail. It was made clear that they will be continuously monitored to check that they have not given the child to the intended parents. Even though she has been given no choice in the matter, Thida seems to have few regrets. She now thinks of the boy as her own child, even though she knows there is no genetic link. I don’t mind that he is not related to us, it’s now impossible to give him away But his arrival poses a dire financial problem. Her husband’s earnings of $250 per month are insufficient for bringing up a child, and because the baby wasn’t handed over to the intended parents, Thida never received the promised $10,000. She would like to scrape together enough money to start a grocery business, in order to bring in a second income, but it’s unclear where that capital will come from. Luckily, her husband loves the boy too. “My husband always plays with the baby straight after he gets home from work,” says Thida. “He helps take care of him at night, so I can sleep.” And Sre-Oun, the mother-in-law, is also deeply attached to the new member of the household. “I don’t mind that he is not related to us, it’s now impossible to give him away,” she says. “He is so cute, even when he is screaming for people to play with him!” When Thida took the baby to the health centre for a check-up, the staff called him a “Barang’s son”, the Khmer term for a mixed-race baby with a white father. “I don’t tell them that he is lighter skinned because he is actually Chinese,” she says. She likes it when market vendors coo over him. “They say that he has his father’s face, which is why he is very handsome,” she says. “It makes me feel so happy that people say he looks like his father.” She has no plans to tell them how he was conceived, and won’t tell the boy either - until he is 18 anyway, and can decide for himself whether to look for his biological parents. But it’s possible that the parents could reappear earlier than that. It’s unlikely that they know where Thida lives, but it’s not beyond the realms of possibility that they could find out. Thida is relaxed about this prospect and would not try to stop them visiting. “I know they love the baby as well, but they cannot take him away from me,” she says. But Sre-Oun is more wary. “I am afraid that they will steal him away from us,” she says. In a village on the Mekong river, many hours from Phnom Penh, a young family has recently been reunited. Sok and his wife, Neth, live with their two daughters aged six and two, in a traditional Cambodian house on stilts. The floors are made of bamboo and the walls are pieces of corrugated iron. A naked light bulb hangs from the rafters. This one room is home to 17 people - and it is for this reason that Neth went away to Phnom Penh to become a surrogate mother: to earn enough to build a new house. On Sok’s meagre income as a fisherman in the Mekong, it’s not clear they will ever be able to afford it. Neth, heavily pregnant, was released at the same time as Thida. She doesn’t know anything about the intended parents of the child she is carrying - most were Chinese, but one couple is known to have been Japanese, and one Angolan. She may find out when she gives birth. Sok, her husband, was always against the surrogacy plan. When Neth first mentioned it, he told her not to do it. He’d heard from a relative about the ban and thought it was too risky. “OK, I’ll give up the surrogacy idea - I’ll earn money by being a maid in the city instead,” Neth told him. But she went to the city and stuck to her original plan. When she called Sok to tell him the embryo had been implanted, he says he was speechless with shock. Not long afterwards, the villa where the mothers were living was raided and the story was all over the news. Some people in the village recognised Neth and the rumour spread. For this reason, she plans to tell the child how he came into existence. “If I don’t tell him, the neighbours will,” she says. Like Thida and her family, Sok and Neth now face a grave financial challenge. Neth received $500 as a down payment when she became a surrogate mother, but much of that appears to have gone already. I don’t want my children to grow up uneducated like me She says they have saved $50 to pay for hospital fees, but it won’t be enough. Sok’s income varies from $5 on a bad day, to $25 on a good one. The last month has not been good, but February is a better month for fishing. In an ideal world he would earn enough to feed the new baby and to put some aside for schooling. “I don’t want my children to grow up uneducated like me,” he says. Neth is still considering looking for a job in Phnom Penh after the baby arrives, but she would first have to get permission. Currently she has to present herself each month at the provincial police office. Before moving away she would need the authorities to allow her to check in at a different police office near her new address. She is hoping to breastfeed the baby, in order to save money on formula milk. An NGO called Agape International Missions, which has been helping the surrogate mothers since they were arrested, has given them all a basket of baby clothes, some nappies and two towels. While Thida took the formula milk gladly, and was disappointed there was not more, Neth has refused it. As for the possibility of contact with the intended parents, Neth flatly rules it out. “I wouldn’t let them meet the baby because they are strangers to me,” she says. She wouldn’t even consider receiving financial assistance from them. “I am very scared to receive any money or have anything to do with them,” she says. Sok knows that money is going to be very tight with an extra mouth to feed, but he won’t let his family see that he is worried. “Life is about to get harder,” he says. The commercial surrogacy industry took off in Cambodia after it had been banned in Thailand and India in 2015, and Nepal in 2016. Liang Bo By chance this roughly coincided with the relaxation of China’s one-child policy. Suddenly many Chinese couples could now legally have another child, but some were unable to do so naturally. “They’re too old to give birth themselves, but their financial and social situations are better now to bring up children,” says Liang Bo, chairman of the Shenzhou Zhongtai fertility and surrogacy agency. But as surrogacy is not permitted in China, Shenzhou Zhongtai and other Chinese agencies began to focus on Cambodia. “We have helped not just Chinese parents, but American, Canadian, Thai, Japanese, Nepalese… there were two Russian couples who had Aids, they used our services and successfully had children through surrogates,” Liang Bo says. It’s a terrible loss for those people who wanted to have children Since Cambodia’s ban he has stopped hiring Cambodian surrogates, he says. He now tells clients “not to take the cheap option”, but to opt for the US or Ukraine. Cambodian women arrested for their alleged involvement in an illegal surrogacy business, June 2018 Liang Bo says the 33 surrogates arrested in June had nothing to do with him, they had all been hired by smaller agencies. “All those agencies sprang up in the past two or three years. There are maybe 500 or 600 of them. Sometimes, there’s only one person behind each agency,” he says. Nonetheless, on the night of the arrest he started getting desperate calls from couples who wanted information and couldn’t get through to their agents. “I tried to help but I didn’t recognise the names they had given me. Ah Hong? Ah Liang? They’re just fake names that agents used to contact the clients. It’s a terrible loss for those people who wanted to have children.” It’s likely that each couple had paid upwards of $70,000, and that their money has now been lost. But worst of all, their child will now be born, and grow up, in someone else’s family. Chou Bun Eng, Cambodia’s deputy interior minister, says she knows some of the intended parents have managed to track down the surrogate mothers. The government is monitoring them, she says. Chou Bun Eng “If we wanted to arrest them, we could have done it a long time ago, but we will only arrest them if they smuggle the children out of the country.” But there is nothing to stop the intended parents financially supporting the surrogate mothers, she says. “They can pay for the formula milk, school fees - we can’t prevent them from doing charity.” This opens up the possibility of the surrogate mothers becoming caretaker parents until the child reaches 18 and is able to decide whether to stay in Cambodia, or join the biological parents abroad. In Cambodian law, the woman who is pregnant - the baby in her womb is her child Chou Bun Eng argues that Cambodia had to ban commercial surrogacy because it is a form of trafficking - she is also the vice-chair of the government’s Anti-Human Trafficking Committee. Wherever commercial surrogacy occurs “children are victims” she says. “They negotiate the price in the womb. They don’t care about the children because the children are like goods. If the children are handicapped the price decreases. They will give them away and take no responsibility for them. Sometimes the children will be sold again to someone else.” The mothers themselves often don’t know who paid for the baby, she says, they only know the agency. And in the government’s view the intended parents are not really parents anyway. “In Cambodian law, the woman who is pregnant - the baby in her womb is her child,” she says. The way Chou Bun Eng sees it, arresting the surrogate mothers was a way of protecting them. “The surrogate mothers carried these children. Some are breastfeeding their children and take care of them every day. I think that they love them as their own children.” And if they do not love them, she says, “then we hold that against them”. Bopha, 37, carried a baby for a Dutch gay couple soon after the ban on surrogacy was declared but before the crackdown began. Like Thida and Neth she did it because she was poor, but she disagrees with the view that surrogacy is a form of human trafficking. “Surrogate mothers also do it to help other people who aren’t able to have babies. Maybe the parents are too old, or they’re a gay couple. Surrogates are employed to help them, so to use the term ‘trafficking’ I think is too much.” Though she still lives in a corrugated iron hut, the money she earned came in very useful. She paid back some debts, bought some land, and was able to set herself up as a seller of cosmetics. She says she is still in touch with one of the fathers of the baby she bore. He came to Cambodia to look after her while she was pregnant and was present at the birth. Now they are friends on Facebook and he sends photographs from time to time. “I get to see the baby grow up. In the videos I saw him learn to walk… learn how to run. He has also learned how to feed himself.” Bopha misses the baby. “In my mind he is my son,” she says. She wonders what it would be like to be one of the surrogate mothers. “I just don’t understand why they need to punish the women like this.” Va-Tei also gave birth to a child last year, but her relationship with the intended parents - a gay couple in the US - was very different. To help get the baby out of the country, Va-Tei had to get him a passport. In the passport office, she had to hide his face so that officials wouldn’t notice he didn’t have Cambodian features. Then they all flew to Singapore together. The baby was handed over once the plane was airborne. I really felt so sad that I had to give the baby away It was clear that the men didn’t trust her, Va-Tei says, describing their journey to the airport in Singapore, before they flew to the US. “That was my last chance to hold the baby. The couple didn’t want me to, so I asked the tuk-tuk driver to translate that they shouldn’t worry. I wasn’t going to take the baby away.” Later, at the airport, she had to walk close to one of the fathers, to give the impression that he was her husband, and that she was seeing him off. Then they disappeared with the child and she flew back to Cambodia alone. Va-Tei vaguely remembers the baby’s name. “It is quite long and difficult to pronounce. Once I laid awake all night to try and remember the name of the baby. I just remember the sound ‘ni-co-la.’” Nicholas? “Yes, Nicholas, the baby boy.” She left a message with the baby: “I wish that you will have a bright future. I wish you will have a good job.” She thinks that it was in the baby’s interests to leave for the US, as she wouldn’t have been able to afford to feed him properly, but she still has regrets. “I really felt so sad that I had to give the baby away, I really didn’t want to. The baby was so cute and I had only one photo of him.” And she made a big mistake: “I gave that photo to the couple, so now I don’t have anything to remember him by.” Va-Tei still thinks about Nicholas from time to time. “I think about how he is growing up, what he looks like. The parents don’t contact me. Some other surrogate mothers are sent photos of the child growing up. But for me… nothing at all.” Some names have been changed Built with Shorthand",Positive,0.9999919

"Louella Fletcher-Michie was found dead in a wooded area on the edge of the Bestival site Actor John Michie has told a jury he begged security staff at a music festival to let him through the gates as his daughter lay dying inside. He and his wife rushed to the Bestival site after hearing Louella Fletcher-Michie, 24, screeching ""like a wild animal"" on the phone, a court heard. Winchester Crown Court has heard she was found dead after taking 2CP. Boyfriend Ceon Broughton, 29, denies manslaughter and supplying drugs. The court heard Mr Michie and his wife Carol drove 130 miles (209km) from London to the festival, held at Lulworth Castle, Dorset to get to their daughter. Giving evidence, the Holby City star wept as he described his efforts to persuade a member of security staff to let him in. He said he eventually convinced one attendant to take his phone, which had a location pin-drop sent to them by Mr Broughton, while they waited at the entrance. The couple waited up to 90 minutes before they heard their daughter's body had been found, he said. The jury has heard Mr Broughton has admitted supplying 2-CP to Ms Fletcher-Michie and her friend at Glastonbury in 2017 Carol Fletcher-Michie, told the court she heard her daughter repeating phrases in a ""horrible voice"" as she spoke to Mr Broughton on the phone on 10 September 2017. ""She was like a wild animal in the background. That was the last time I heard her voice. She was screeching,"" she told the jury. The trial previously heard Ms Fletcher-Michie had urged her boyfriend to film her after she had taken the Class A drug. She was found dead by security guards at 01:15 on what would have been her 25th birthday. John Michie and wife Carol Fletcher-Michie, seen here leaving court, drove to the Bestival site to try and help their daughter Prosecutors have alleged Mr Broughton failed to seek help because he feared breaching a suspended jail sentence. In the witness box, Mr Michie described how he had later released a statement defending Mr Broughton, after newspapers reported that a murder investigation was under way. ""I believed him to be a good person at the time. Clearly, I made a mistake. ""I didn't realise how in the six hours he was with her, he had not taken her to get help, how he had seen her very, very distressed state. ""I believe he even filmed her after she was dead. ""I think Louella loved Ceon. I'm not sure that he loved her. ""I don't know how you could say you love someone if you left them to die in front of you. ""If I was in Ceon's situation, I would have taken another human being, let alone my girlfriend who I was supposed to love, to a medical tent to save her life."" Mr Michie said Mr Broughton dismissed his daughter for overreacting, adding: ""I've since learnt he described her as a drama queen, which is hurtful."" Ceon Broughton could be seen laughing and smiling during the 50-minute video previously shown to the jury Describing the phone call from Mr Broughton, Mr Michie said: ""The thing that I most remember was that Louella seemed very distressed. ""I could hear her in the background shouting things like 'I hate you, I don't trust you', obviously referring to Ceon. ""I've never heard her speak in that way. It almost didn't sound like her."" Mr Michie said Mr Broughton's voice, on loudspeaker, sounded ""watery"", ""without energy in it"" and he didn't seem ""compos mentis"". ""He didn't seem to be concerned, I thought. Obviously any normal person would be concerned,"" he added. Stephen Kamlish QC, defending Mr Broughton, said a lot of what Mr Michie had told the jury was wrong. ""You don't know for example how many times he told people where he was,"" he said. Ms Fletcher-Michie's sister, Daisy, told the court how she pleaded with Mr Broughton on the phone to take Louella to a medical tent. ""I couldn't get any sense of urgency... He didn't say much at all, just like a really slow, 'yeah, yeah, ok,"" she said. ""There's no way I can believe in six hours someone [wouldn't make] their best efforts to get 400m to a medical tent."" Mr Kamlish suggested the terrain was difficult and Ms Fletcher-Michie was angry at her boyfriend. ""I'm pretty sure a 28-year-old man could overpower her in a desperate situation like that and carry her,"" Daisy Fletcher-Michie replied. Siblings Sam and Daisy Fletcher-Michie gave evidence on Thursday Bestival is held in the grounds of Lulworth Castle Her brother, Sam, recalled how he asked Mr Broughton what drug his sister had taken. ""It was 2CB and he said, 'but I bumped it up a bit,'"" Mr Fletcher-Michie told the court. He said he did not not understand whether that meant a bigger dose or an additional drug, and he thought 2CB and 2CP were the same thing. Mr Kamlish said: ""You may have thought you heard 'bumped it up', but you heard 'bumped it',"" which the barrister said was a phrase meaning 'took drugs'. Sam Fletcher-Michie insisted he had heard correctly. Man 'filmed dying girlfriend' at festival Woman 'wanted drugs trip on YouTube' Earlier, the jury in the case was reduced to 11 after the judge discharged a woman ""for personal reasons"". The trial has previously heard Mr Broughton has pleaded guilty to supplying 2CP to Ms Fletcher-Michie and her friend at Glastonbury Festival in 2017. The trial continues.

" Most surrogate mothers have already given birth at least once, so Thida is unusual. In her early 20s and married to a repairman in a village outside Phnom Penh, she could never afford to have children. But if she earned $10,000 by giving birth to a foreigner’s child everything would change; by becoming a surrogate mother she would have enough money to start her own family. So when a representative from a surrogacy agency visited her village she put her name forward - and was accepted. “If I had known it was illegal, I would never have done it,” Thida says. In fact, by the time the fertilised egg from a Chinese couple was implanted in her womb, at the end of 2017, commercial surrogacy had already been banned for more than a year, but the ban had only recently begun to be enforced. Once pregnant, Thida was taken to a crowded villa in the capital’s expensive Russey Keo district. Soon there were 32 other pregnant mothers there, living five to a room. “The rooms were so small there was no space to walk,” she says. Those who were heavily pregnant wanted to pace up and down, but there was no room - and they weren’t allowed outside. He is my first child, I really love him so much Then in June the police pounced. First employees of the surrogacy agency were taken away and charged with trafficking. Before long, the mothers were also charged, apart from one - a Thai woman - who was deported. Thida started feeling contractions late one night in October, and was taken to hospital by ambulance the following morning. When the baby was born, Thida was eager to see his face, so the doctor put him on her chest for five minutes before taking him away to be cleaned. “He is my first child, I really love him so much,” she says. “I felt awful that he came into the world and was imprisoned in the police hospital with me for months.” A dozen women who had already delivered their babies were put in a big room, with hammocks for beds. By bribing the guards, Thida’s mother-in-law, Sre-Oun, was able to make regular visits, bringing nappies, fruit and powdered milk. The mothers had not been fed well enough to breastfeed, she says. Then, three days after the birth, the baby’s Chinese parents arrived. Thida caught a glimpse of the wife from the hospital window. The father gave a hospital guard a $100 bribe and entered the ward with a Khmer translator. “He held the baby and cried like his heart was broken,” says Thida. “I really felt so sorry for him.” He spent 20 minutes with his son, then rejoined his wife outside. The meeting was so frantic that Thida didn’t exchange phone numbers with him. Then in December, Thida and the boy were allowed to go home. Before leaving, Thida and the other mothers were told that they must raise the children until their 18th birthday or face up to 20 years in jail. It was made clear that they will be continuously monitored to check that they have not given the child to the intended parents. Even though she has been given no choice in the matter, Thida seems to have few regrets. She now thinks of the boy as her own child, even though she knows there is no genetic link. I don’t mind that he is not related to us, it’s now impossible to give him away But his arrival poses a dire financial problem. Her husband’s earnings of $250 per month are insufficient for bringing up a child, and because the baby wasn’t handed over to the intended parents, Thida never received the promised $10,000. She would like to scrape together enough money to start a grocery business, in order to bring in a second income, but it’s unclear where that capital will come from. Luckily, her husband loves the boy too. “My husband always plays with the baby straight after he gets home from work,” says Thida. “He helps take care of him at night, so I can sleep.” And Sre-Oun, the mother-in-law, is also deeply attached to the new member of the household. “I don’t mind that he is not related to us, it’s now impossible to give him away,” she says. “He is so cute, even when he is screaming for people to play with him!” When Thida took the baby to the health centre for a check-up, the staff called him a “Barang’s son”, the Khmer term for a mixed-race baby with a white father. “I don’t tell them that he is lighter skinned because he is actually Chinese,” she says. She likes it when market vendors coo over him. “They say that he has his father’s face, which is why he is very handsome,” she says. “It makes me feel so happy that people say he looks like his father.” She has no plans to tell them how he was conceived, and won’t tell the boy either - until he is 18 anyway, and can decide for himself whether to look for his biological parents. But it’s possible that the parents could reappear earlier than that. It’s unlikely that they know where Thida lives, but it’s not beyond the realms of possibility that they could find out. Thida is relaxed about this prospect and would not try to stop them visiting. “I know they love the baby as well, but they cannot take him away from me,” she says. But Sre-Oun is more wary. “I am afraid that they will steal him away from us,” she says. In a village on the Mekong river, many hours from Phnom Penh, a young family has recently been reunited. Sok and his wife, Neth, live with their two daughters aged six and two, in a traditional Cambodian house on stilts. The floors are made of bamboo and the walls are pieces of corrugated iron. A naked light bulb hangs from the rafters. This one room is home to 17 people - and it is for this reason that Neth went away to Phnom Penh to become a surrogate mother: to earn enough to build a new house. On Sok’s meagre income as a fisherman in the Mekong, it’s not clear they will ever be able to afford it. Neth, heavily pregnant, was released at the same time as Thida. She doesn’t know anything about the intended parents of the child she is carrying - most were Chinese, but one couple is known to have been Japanese, and one Angolan. She may find out when she gives birth. Sok, her husband, was always against the surrogacy plan. When Neth first mentioned it, he told her not to do it. He’d heard from a relative about the ban and thought it was too risky. “OK, I’ll give up the surrogacy idea - I’ll earn money by being a maid in the city instead,” Neth told him. But she went to the city and stuck to her original plan. When she called Sok to tell him the embryo had been implanted, he says he was speechless with shock. Not long afterwards, the villa where the mothers were living was raided and the story was all over the news. Some people in the village recognised Neth and the rumour spread. For this reason, she plans to tell the child how he came into existence. “If I don’t tell him, the neighbours will,” she says. Like Thida and her family, Sok and Neth now face a grave financial challenge. Neth received $500 as a down payment when she became a surrogate mother, but much of that appears to have gone already. I don’t want my children to grow up uneducated like me She says they have saved $50 to pay for hospital fees, but it won’t be enough. Sok’s income varies from $5 on a bad day, to $25 on a good one. The last month has not been good, but February is a better month for fishing. In an ideal world he would earn enough to feed the new baby and to put some aside for schooling. “I don’t want my children to grow up uneducated like me,” he says. Neth is still considering looking for a job in Phnom Penh after the baby arrives, but she would first have to get permission. Currently she has to present herself each month at the provincial police office. Before moving away she would need the authorities to allow her to check in at a different police office near her new address. She is hoping to breastfeed the baby, in order to save money on formula milk. An NGO called Agape International Missions, which has been helping the surrogate mothers since they were arrested, has given them all a basket of baby clothes, some nappies and two towels. While Thida took the formula milk gladly, and was disappointed there was not more, Neth has refused it. As for the possibility of contact with the intended parents, Neth flatly rules it out. “I wouldn’t let them meet the baby because they are strangers to me,” she says. She wouldn’t even consider receiving financial assistance from them. “I am very scared to receive any money or have anything to do with them,” she says. Sok knows that money is going to be very tight with an extra mouth to feed, but he won’t let his family see that he is worried. “Life is about to get harder,” he says. The commercial surrogacy industry took off in Cambodia after it had been banned in Thailand and India in 2015, and Nepal in 2016. Liang Bo By chance this roughly coincided with the relaxation of China’s one-child policy. Suddenly many Chinese couples could now legally have another child, but some were unable to do so naturally. “They’re too old to give birth themselves, but their financial and social situations are better now to bring up children,” says Liang Bo, chairman of the Shenzhou Zhongtai fertility and surrogacy agency. But as surrogacy is not permitted in China, Shenzhou Zhongtai and other Chinese agencies began to focus on Cambodia. “We have helped not just Chinese parents, but American, Canadian, Thai, Japanese, Nepalese… there were two Russian couples who had Aids, they used our services and successfully had children through surrogates,” Liang Bo says. It’s a terrible loss for those people who wanted to have children Since Cambodia’s ban he has stopped hiring Cambodian surrogates, he says. He now tells clients “not to take the cheap option”, but to opt for the US or Ukraine. Cambodian women arrested for their alleged involvement in an illegal surrogacy business, June 2018 Liang Bo says the 33 surrogates arrested in June had nothing to do with him, they had all been hired by smaller agencies. “All those agencies sprang up in the past two or three years. There are maybe 500 or 600 of them. Sometimes, there’s only one person behind each agency,” he says. Nonetheless, on the night of the arrest he started getting desperate calls from couples who wanted information and couldn’t get through to their agents. “I tried to help but I didn’t recognise the names they had given me. Ah Hong? Ah Liang? They’re just fake names that agents used to contact the clients. It’s a terrible loss for those people who wanted to have children.” It’s likely that each couple had paid upwards of $70,000, and that their money has now been lost. But worst of all, their child will now be born, and grow up, in someone else’s family. Chou Bun Eng, Cambodia’s deputy interior minister, says she knows some of the intended parents have managed to track down the surrogate mothers. The government is monitoring them, she says. Chou Bun Eng “If we wanted to arrest them, we could have done it a long time ago, but we will only arrest them if they smuggle the children out of the country.” But there is nothing to stop the intended parents financially supporting the surrogate mothers, she says. “They can pay for the formula milk, school fees - we can’t prevent them from doing charity.” This opens up the possibility of the surrogate mothers becoming caretaker parents until the child reaches 18 and is able to decide whether to stay in Cambodia, or join the biological parents abroad.

"Stephen Waterson and Adrian Hoare both deny manslaughter A man said he would ""not be told what to do by a three-year-old"" as he crushed his girlfriend's son with a car seat, a court has heard. Stephen Waterson, 25, is accused of twice pushing the front passenger seat of his Audi convertible into Alfie Lamb, who was in the footwell behind. The boy's mother, Adrian Hoare, 23, told the Old Bailey Mr Waterson got ""annoyed"" after saying he did not have enough space for his legs. Both deny manslaughter. The pair and Alfie were in the car with two other adults and another child during the journey from Sutton to Croydon on 1 February last year. Alfie Lamb had been in the rear footwell of the Audi with another child Giving evidence, Ms Hoare said Alfie was ""irritable and tired"" after the shopping trip and made it known he was uncomfortable in the rear footwell of the Audi. She told the jury he called out ""mummy"" when Mr Waterson first moved his chair back, and Ms Hoare asked her partner to shift forwards again. The hairdresser said he got annoyed, shouted at the boy and ""told him to shut up"" which ""scared"" her son. ""After he said that he did not have room for his legs, he made another comment along the lines he was not being told what to do by a three-year-old because we asked for the chair to be moved, and he moved his chair back again,"" she said. Mr Waterson has told the court he only moved his seat back an inch, before moving forwards again Ms Hoare, who is accused of not doing anything to help her son, told the court she never thought Alfie was in danger and thought he had gone to sleep when he went quiet. When they arrived at Mr Waterson's flat in Croydon, they found the three-year-old had gone floppy but ""everybody thought he was playing to start with"". Crush death mum 'scared of partner' Boy death accused 'had powerful parents' Alfie Lamb's injuries 'like car crash' Ms Hoare denies manslaughter, child cruelty and common assault on Emilie Williams, who was also in the car.

"Animal Farm writer George Orwell died in 1950 It seems even the best of writers get rejected - but not all of them can expect an apology 70 years later. The British Council has apologised to George Orwell after rejecting an essay of his seven decades ago. The author of 1984 and Animal Farm wrote the piece, entitledBritish Cookery,external, in 1946. But the council, which promotes British relations with other countries, told Orwell it would be ""unwise to publish it for the continental reader"". The editor acknowledges it is an ""excellent"" essay, but ""with one or two minor criticisms"" - including that Orwell's recipe for orange marmalade contained ""too much sugar and water"". In the essay, Orwell describes the British diet as ""a simple, rather heavy, perhaps slightly barbarous diet"" and where ""hot drinks are acceptable at most hours of the day"". Alasdair Donaldson, British Council senior policy analyst, said: ""It seems that the organisation in those days was somewhat po-faced and risk-averse, and was anxious to avoid producing an essay about food (even one which mentions the disastrous effects of wartime rationing) in the aftermath of the hungry winter of 1945."" He added: ""Over 70 years later, the British Council is delighted to make amends for its slight on perhaps the UK's greatest political writer of the 20th Century, by re-producing the original essay in full - along with the unfortunate rejection letter."" This time of year is perfect for making marmalade. For just a short few weeks, Seville oranges are in season. The strong bitter fruits are a far cry from the sweet oranges we're used to, and are the secret behind marmalade's distinctive tang. Here isOrwell's take,externalon a classic - but beware, according to his editor's tastes, it's a ""bad recipe!"". Ingredients: 2 seville oranges 2 sweet oranges 2 lemons 8lbs (3.6kg) of preserving sugar 8 pints (4.5 litres) of water Method.Wash and dry the fruit. Halve them and squeeze out the juice. Remove some of the pith, then shred the fruit finely. Tie the pips in a muslin bag. Put the strained juice, rind and pips into the water and soak for 48 hours. Place in a large pan and simmer for an hour and a half until the rind is tender. Leave to stand overnight, then add the sugar and let it dissolve before bringing to the boil. Boil rapidly until a little of the mixture will set into a jelly when placed on a cold plate. Pour into jars which have been heated beforehand and cover with paper covers. According to Orwell's essay, breakfast for most people in Britain is ""not a snack but a serious meal"" that consists of three courses. At the end of the meal comes bread, or toast, with orange marmalade. ""Other kinds of jam are seldom eaten at breakfast, and marmalade does not often appear at other times of the day,"" he writes. Tea is the preferred drink with which to wash breakfast down, since ""coffee in Britain is almost always nasty"". Of tea, British people ""are extremely critical, and everyone has his favourite brand and his pet theory as to how it should be made"". ""The British are great eaters of pickles,"" but ""as for vegetables, it must be admitted they seldom get the treatment they deserve"", he writes. ""Cabbage is simply boiled - a method which renders it almost uneatable - while cauliflowers, leeks and marrows are usually smothered in a tasteless white sauce."" Orwell's BBC resignation letter The writer says high tea in 1940s Britain consisted of a variety of savoury and sweet dishes, but ""no tea would be considered a good one if it did not include at least one kind of cake"". ""A particularly delicious kind of tea cake, made to be toasted and buttered, is the crumpet, which is unsweetened and is eaten with salt,"" he continues. ""Crumpets, which are of very strange appearance - they are white, and full of holes like a Gruyere cheese - are made by a process that is known to very few people.""

" Most surrogate mothers have already given birth at least once, so Thida is unusual. In her early 20s and married to a repairman in a village outside Phnom Penh, she could never afford to have children. But if she earned $10,000 by giving birth to a foreigner’s child everything would change; by becoming a surrogate mother she would have enough money to start her own family. So when a representative from a surrogacy agency visited her village she put her name forward - and was accepted. “If I had known it was illegal, I would never have done it,” Thida says. In fact, by the time the fertilised egg from a Chinese couple was implanted in her womb, at the end of 2017, commercial surrogacy had already been banned for more than a year, but the ban had only recently begun to be enforced. Once pregnant, Thida was taken to a crowded villa in the capital’s expensive Russey Keo district. Soon there were 32 other pregnant mothers there, living five to a room. “The rooms were so small there was no space to walk,” she says. Those who were heavily pregnant wanted to pace up and down, but there was no room - and they weren’t allowed outside. He is my first child, I really love him so much Then in June the police pounced. First employees of the surrogacy agency were taken away and charged with trafficking. Before long, the mothers were also charged, apart from one - a Thai woman - who was deported. Thida started feeling contractions late one night in October, and was taken to hospital by ambulance the following morning. When the baby was born, Thida was eager to see his face, so the doctor put him on her chest for five minutes before taking him away to be cleaned. “He is my first child, I really love him so much,” she says. “I felt awful that he came into the world and was imprisoned in the police hospital with me for months.” A dozen women who had already delivered their babies were put in a big room, with hammocks for beds. By bribing the guards, Thida’s mother-in-law, Sre-Oun, was able to make regular visits, bringing nappies, fruit and powdered milk. The mothers had not been fed well enough to breastfeed, she says. Then, three days after the birth, the baby’s Chinese parents arrived. Thida caught a glimpse of the wife from the hospital window. The father gave a hospital guard a $100 bribe and entered the ward with a Khmer translator. “He held the baby and cried like his heart was broken,” says Thida. “I really felt so sorry for him.” He spent 20 minutes with his son, then rejoined his wife outside. The meeting was so frantic that Thida didn’t exchange phone numbers with him. Then in December, Thida and the boy were allowed to go home. Before leaving, Thida and the other mothers were told that they must raise the children until their 18th birthday or face up to 20 years in jail. It was made clear that they will be continuously monitored to check that they have not given the child to the intended parents. Even though she has been given no choice in the matter, Thida seems to have few regrets. She now thinks of the boy as her own child, even though she knows there is no genetic link. I don’t mind that he is not related to us, it’s now impossible to give him away But his arrival poses a dire financial problem. Her husband’s earnings of $250 per month are insufficient for bringing up a child, and because the baby wasn’t handed over to the intended parents, Thida never received the promised $10,000. She would like to scrape together enough money to start a grocery business, in order to bring in a second income, but it’s unclear where that capital will come from. Luckily, her husband loves the boy too. “My husband always plays with the baby straight after he gets home from work,” says Thida. “He helps take care of him at night, so I can sleep.” And Sre-Oun, the mother-in-law, is also deeply attached to the new member of the household. “I don’t mind that he is not related to us, it’s now impossible to give him away,” she says. “He is so cute, even when he is screaming for people to play with him!” When Thida took the baby to the health centre for a check-up, the staff called him a “Barang’s son”, the Khmer term for a mixed-race baby with a white father. “I don’t tell them that he is lighter skinned because he is actually Chinese,” she says. She likes it when market vendors coo over him. “They say that he has his father’s face, which is why he is very handsome,” she says. “It makes me feel so happy that people say he looks like his father.” She has no plans to tell them how he was conceived, and won’t tell the boy either - until he is 18 anyway, and can decide for himself whether to look for his biological parents. But it’s possible that the parents could reappear earlier than that. It’s unlikely that they know where Thida lives, but it’s not beyond the realms of possibility that they could find out. Thida is relaxed about this prospect and would not try to stop them visiting. “I know they love the baby as well, but they cannot take him away from me,” she says. But Sre-Oun is more wary. “I am afraid that they will steal him away from us,” she says. In a village on the Mekong river, many hours from Phnom Penh, a young family has recently been reunited. Sok and his wife, Neth, live with their two daughters aged six and two, in a traditional Cambodian house on stilts. The floors are made of bamboo and the walls are pieces of corrugated iron. A naked light bulb hangs from the rafters. This one room is home to 17 people - and it is for this reason that Neth went away to Phnom Penh to become a surrogate mother: to earn enough to build a new house. On Sok’s meagre income as a fisherman in the Mekong, it’s not clear they will ever be able to afford it. Neth, heavily pregnant, was released at the same time as Thida. She doesn’t know anything about the intended parents of the child she is carrying - most were Chinese, but one couple is known to have been Japanese, and one Angolan. She may find out when she gives birth. Sok, her husband, was always against the surrogacy plan. When Neth first mentioned it, he told her not to do it. He’d heard from a relative about the ban and thought it was too risky. “OK, I’ll give up the surrogacy idea - I’ll earn money by being a maid in the city instead,” Neth told him. But she went to the city and stuck to her original plan. When she called Sok to tell him the embryo had been implanted, he says he was speechless with shock. Not long afterwards, the villa where the mothers were living was raided and the story was all over the news. Some people in the village recognised Neth and the rumour spread. For this reason, she plans to tell the child how he came into existence. “If I don’t tell him, the neighbours will,” she says. Like Thida and her family, Sok and Neth now face a grave financial challenge. Neth received $500 as a down payment when she became a surrogate mother, but much of that appears to have gone already. I don’t want my children to grow up uneducated like me She says they have saved $50 to pay for hospital fees, but it won’t be enough. Sok’s income varies from $5 on a bad day, to $25 on a good one. The last month has not been good, but February is a better month for fishing. In an ideal world he would earn enough to feed the new baby and to put some aside for schooling. “I don’t want my children to grow up uneducated like me,” he says. Neth is still considering looking for a job in Phnom Penh after the baby arrives, but she would first have to get permission. Currently she has to present herself each month at the provincial police office. Before moving away she would need the authorities to allow her to check in at a different police office near her new address. She is hoping to breastfeed the baby, in order to save money on formula milk. An NGO called Agape International Missions, which has been helping the surrogate mothers since they were arrested, has given them all a basket of baby clothes, some nappies and two towels. While Thida took the formula milk gladly, and was disappointed there was not more, Neth has refused it. As for the possibility of contact with the intended parents, Neth flatly rules it out. “I wouldn’t let them meet the baby because they are strangers to me,” she says. She wouldn’t even consider receiving financial assistance from them. “I am very scared to receive any money or have anything to do with them,” she says. Sok knows that money is going to be very tight with an extra mouth to feed, but he won’t let his family see that he is worried. “Life is about to get harder,” he says. The commercial surrogacy industry took off in Cambodia after it had been banned in Thailand and India in 2015, and Nepal in 2016. Liang Bo By chance this roughly coincided with the relaxation of China’s one-child policy. Suddenly many Chinese couples could now legally have another child, but some were unable to do so naturally. “They’re too old to give birth themselves, but their financial and social situations are better now to bring up children,” says Liang Bo, chairman of the Shenzhou Zhongtai fertility and surrogacy agency. But as surrogacy is not permitted in China, Shenzhou Zhongtai and other Chinese agencies began to focus on Cambodia. “We have helped not just Chinese parents, but American, Canadian, Thai, Japanese, Nepalese… there were two Russian couples who had Aids, they used our services and successfully had children through surrogates,” Liang Bo says. It’s a terrible loss for those people who wanted to have children Since Cambodia’s ban he has stopped hiring Cambodian surrogates, he says. He now tells clients “not to take the cheap option”, but to opt for the US or Ukraine. Cambodian women arrested for their alleged involvement in an illegal surrogacy business, June 2018 Liang Bo says the 33 surrogates arrested in June had nothing to do with him, they had all been hired by smaller agencies. “All those agencies sprang up in the past two or three years. There are maybe 500 or 600 of them. Sometimes, there’s only one person behind each agency,” he says. Nonetheless, on the night of the arrest he started getting desperate calls from couples who wanted information and couldn’t get through to their agents. “I tried to help but I didn’t recognise the names they had given me. Ah Hong? Ah Liang? They’re just fake names that agents used to contact the clients. It’s a terrible loss for those people who wanted to have children.” It’s likely that each couple had paid upwards of $70,000, and that their money has now been lost. But worst of all, their child will now be born, and grow up, in someone else’s family. Chou Bun Eng, Cambodia’s deputy interior minister, says she knows some of the intended parents have managed to track down the surrogate mothers. The government is monitoring them, she says. Chou Bun Eng “If we wanted to arrest them, we could have done it a long time ago, but we will only arrest them if they smuggle the children out of the country.” But there is nothing to stop the intended parents financially supporting the surrogate mothers, she says. “They can pay for the formula milk, school fees - we can’t prevent them from doing charity.” This opens up the possibility of the surrogate mothers becoming caretaker parents until the child reaches 18 and is able to decide whether to stay in Cambodia, or join the biological parents abroad. In Cambodian law, the woman who is pregnant - the baby in her womb is her child Chou Bun Eng argues that Cambodia had to ban commercial surrogacy because it is a form of trafficking - she is also the vice-chair of the government’s Anti-Human Trafficking Committee. Wherever commercial surrogacy occurs “children are victims” she says. “They negotiate the price in the womb. They don’t care about the children because the children are like goods. If the children are handicapped the price decreases. They will give them away and take no responsibility for them. Sometimes the children will be sold again to someone else.” The mothers themselves often don’t know who paid for the baby, she says, they only know the agency. And in the government’s view the intended parents are not really parents anyway. “In Cambodian law, the woman who is pregnant - the baby in her womb is her child,” she says. The way Chou Bun Eng sees it, arresting the surrogate mothers was a way of protecting them. “The surrogate mothers carried these children. Some are breastfeeding their children and take care of them every day. I think that they love them as their own children.” And if they do not love them, she says, “then we hold that against them”. Bopha, 37, carried a baby for a Dutch gay couple soon after the ban on surrogacy was declared but before the crackdown began. Like Thida and Neth she did it because she was poor, but she disagrees with the view that surrogacy is a form of human trafficking. “Surrogate mothers also do it to help other people who aren’t able to have babies. Maybe the parents are too old, or they’re a gay couple. Surrogates are employed to help them, so to use the term ‘trafficking’ I think is too much.” Though she still lives in a corrugated iron hut, the money she earned came in very useful. She paid back some debts, bought some land, and was able to set herself up as a seller of cosmetics. She says she is still in touch with one of the fathers of the baby she bore. He came to Cambodia to look after her while she was pregnant and was present at the birth. Now they are friends on Facebook and he sends photographs from time to time. “I get to see the baby grow up. In the videos I saw him learn to walk… learn how to run. He has also learned how to feed himself.” Bopha misses the baby. “In my mind he is my son,” she says. She wonders what it would be like to be one of the surrogate mothers. “I just don’t understand why they need to punish the women like this.” Va-Tei also gave birth to a child last year, but her relationship with the intended parents - a gay couple in the US - was very different. To help get the baby out of the country, Va-Tei had to get him a passport. In the passport office, she had to hide his face so that officials wouldn’t notice he didn’t have Cambodian features. Then they all flew to Singapore together. The baby was handed over once the plane was airborne. I really felt so sad that I had to give the baby away It was clear that the men didn’t trust her, Va-Tei says, describing their journey to the airport in Singapore, before they flew to the US. “That was my last chance to hold the baby. The couple didn’t want me to, so I asked the tuk-tuk driver to translate that they shouldn’t worry. I wasn’t going to take the baby away.” Later, at the airport, she had to walk close to one of the fathers, to give the impression that he was her husband, and that she was seeing him off. Then they disappeared with the child and she flew back to Cambodia alone. Va-Tei vaguely remembers the baby’s name. “It is quite long and difficult to pronounce. Once I laid awake all night to try and remember the name of the baby. I just remember the sound ‘ni-co-la.’” Nicholas? “Yes, Nicholas, the baby boy.” She left a message with the baby: “I wish that you will have a bright future. I wish you will have a good job.” She thinks that it was in the baby’s interests to leave for the US, as she wouldn’t have been able to afford to feed him properly, but she still has regrets. “I really felt so sad that I had to give the baby away, I really didn’t want to. The baby was so cute and I had only one photo of him.” And she made a big mistake: “I gave that photo to the couple, so now I don’t have anything to remember him by.” Va-Tei still thinks about Nicholas from time to time. “I think about how he is growing up, what he looks like. The parents don’t contact me. Some other surrogate mothers are sent photos of the child growing up. But for me… nothing at all.” Some names have been changed Built with Shorthand",Positive,0.9999999

"The Rosalind Franklin rover is due to launch to Mars next year The UK-assembled rover that will be sent to Mars in 2020 will bear the name of DNA pioneer Rosalind Franklin. The honour follows a public call for suggestions that drew nearly 36,000 responses from right across Europe. Astronaut Tim Peake unveiled the name at the Airbus factory in Stevenage where the robot is being put together. The six-wheeled vehicle will be equipped with instruments and a drill to search for evidence of past or present life on the Red Planet. The unveiling of the name was orchestrated by UK astronaut Tim Peake Giving the rover a name associated with a molecule fundamental to biology seems therefore to be wholly appropriate. Rosalind Franklin played an integral role in the discovery of the structure of deoxyribonucleic acid. It was her X-ray images that allowed James Watson and Francis Crick to decipher its double-helix shape. Franklin's early death from ovarian cancer in 1958, aged just 37, meant she never received the recognition given to her male peers. The attachment to the European Space Agency (Esa) rover will now see her name travel beyond Earth. ""In the last year of Rosalind's life, I remember visiting her in hospital on the day when she was excited by the news of the [Soviet Sputnik satellite] - the very beginning of space exploration,"" Franklin's sister, Jenifer Glynn, said on Thursday. ""She could never have imagined that over 60 years later there would be a rover sent to Mars bearing her name, but somehow that makes this project even more special."" Mars robot to be sent to Oxia Planum What's it like to ride a rocket to Mars? Touchdown triumph for Nasa's Mars probe Final assembly of the rover is under way at the Airbus factory in Stevenage In 1952, Rosalind Franklin was at King's College London investigating the atomic arrangement of DNA, using her skills as an X-ray crystallographer to create images for analysis. One of her team's pictures, known as Photo 51, provided the essential insights for Crick and Watson to build the first three-dimensional model of the two-stranded macromolecule. It was one of the supreme achievements of 20th Century science, enabling researchers to finally understand how DNA stored, copied and transmitted the genetic ""code of life"". Crick, Watson, and King's colleague Maurice Wilkins, received the 1962 Nobel Prize for the breakthrough. Franklin's untimely death meant she could not be considered for the award (Nobels are not awarded posthumously). However, many argue that her contribution has never really been given the attention it deserves, and has even been underplayed. BBC - In Our Time: Melvyn Bragg recalls the achievements of Rosalind Franklin Photo 51 was a eureka moment for Crick and Watson Up until now, the rover has simply been known by its Esa project name - ExoMars. In the UK, many people have also become familiar with the names given to the prototype robots that Airbus built to trial the vehicle's technology. These have been names like Bridget, Bruno and Bryan. The ""B"" letter is a play on the word ""breadboard"" - the term describing the bald plate engineers use to design new electronic circuitry. But it has become common practice now for space missions to have a ceremonial name. Sometimes these are just glorified acronyms that summarise the mission goals, but often they reference a historical figure who made a significant contribution in a relevant field of science. For recent European Space Agency projects, Italian scientists have been honoured, including Giuseppe ""Bepi"" Colombo (Mercury mission) and Giovanni Schiaparelli (a previous Mars lander). Rosalind Franklin was chosen by a UK-led panel who sifted through 35,844 suggestions. ""We had the usual clutch of acronyms, deities and inspirational words, but when we got down to the short shortlist - it was the obvious choice. It ticks all the boxes,"" Dr Sue Horne, the head space exploration at the UK Space Agency, told BBC News. Britain essentially got the naming rights because it has put most money into the rover. ""Rover McRoverFace"" was suggested but theUK Space Agency made it clear at the outsetthat there would be no repeat of the furore that accompaniedthe naming of Britain's new polar ship. This video can not be played Take a closer look at the Rosalind Franklin design The rocket that will send the Franklin rover to Mars is booked to launch in July/August 2020. The various components needed for the mission are gradually coming together under the direction of Esa and its partner on the venture - the Russian space agency, Roscosmos. British engineers are on target to deliver a finished robot at the end of July. This will go first to an Airbus test centre in Toulouse, France. From there, it will head east, to Cannes. On the CÃ´te d'Azur, the Franklin rover will be integrated with its German ""cruise"" capsule, which will carry it to the vicinity of the Red Planet, and the Russian landing mechanism, which will have the all-important job of putting the rover down safely on the surface of Mars in March 2021. From Cannes, these elements go to the Baikonur Cosmodrome to be mated with the launch rocket. The schedule is tight, conceded Prof Jan WÃ¶rner, the director-general of Esa: ""It's a challenge but we're working really hard to make the launch date."" Airbus has built a special ""cleanroom"" to assemble the rover. The Franklin vehicle's parts are being brought to Stevenage from across Esa member states and Canada.

"Luxury fashion brand Gucci has withdrawn a woollen jumper from sale after the item was criticised for ""resembling blackface."" The black ""balaclava jumper"" covered the lower half of the face and featured a red cut-out around the mouth. The item prompted a backlash on social media by users who claimed the design was offensive. In a statement,Gucci apologised for any offence caused,externaland said it would be removed from sale. The brand said it would turn the incident ""into a powerful learning moment for the Gucci team"" and was committed to increasing diversity. Behind the legacy of America's blackface Blackface has a history of perpetuating offensive and racist stereotypes of African Americans dating back more than 200 years in the United States.

Gucci's troubles mark the latest in a string of missteps by luxury fashion brands. Last month, Prada withdrew items over concerns it had depicted blackface imagery. The label pulled products from a line of goods called Pradamalia which appeared to resemble black monkeys with large red lips. Are adverts being deliberately racist? Dolce & Gabbanacancelled its Shanghai fashion show amid accusations of racism. The brand posted videos of a Chinese model eating Italian foods like pizza and pasta with chopsticks. Widely seen as offensive, the campaign led to a severe backlash in China with several retailers pulling the brand's products. D&G also caused controversy in 2016 when it called an item of footwear in its spring/summer collection a ""slave sandal"".

"More than half of British households are set to see an increase in the cost of energy in April after the regulator, Ofgem, raised price caps. Ofgem sets maximum prices that can be charged for gas and electricity to those who have not switched suppliers and are on default tariffs. The new cap could see these households typically pay an extra Â£117 a year. The regulator is allowing suppliers to cover the higher costs they face on the wholesale market. ""We can assure these customers that they remain protected from being overcharged for their energy and that these increases are only due to actual rises in energy costs, rather than excess charges from supplier profiteering,"" said Dermot Nolan, chief executive of Ofgem. Energy firms under investigation are handed new customers Winter likely to finish off some energy firms, analysts say Would you trust an auto-switching site for life? About 11 million households are on default, or standard variable tariffs, and are set to be affected. Such a household, which uses a typical amount of energy and pays the bill by direct debit, should now expect to pay Â£1,254 a year. Consumer groups say they can shop around for a better deal. Another four million people are on prepayment meters, so pay for their energy in advance. The price cap will rise on their tariffs too, with the typical customer paying Â£1,242 per year, up by Â£106 from the previous cap level. Jackie Foran says she plans to switch to a cheaper deal One customer set to see a price rise is Jackie Foran, of Northenden, south Manchester. The 65-year-old ended up on a default tariff after her original supplier went bust, and pays about Â£100 a month despite living alone. ""I think quite a lot of elderly people will be caught by surprise, because when somebody says [the price] is capped, you think you don't have to do anything, you don't have to worry, it will all be perfectly fine,"" she said. ""But you could still be on an expensive rate, even though it is capped. It could make a big difference to the bills. ""In my mind, they are not really capping it are they?"" She intends to shop around for a better deal before April. Energy price capping is a flagship government policy designed to protect the vulnerable and those who have stayed loyal to their energy supplier. Ofgem sets the cap for households in England, Wales and Scotland. Northern Ireland has a separate energy regulator and its own price cap. Ofgem sets a cap on the unit price of energy for electricity and gas, and a maximum standing charge. Energy companies are not allowed to charge default tariffs that are higher than these thresholds. The first cap came into force at the start of January. Ofgem said this price limit meant households typically saved Â£76 a year on what they would have been charged without the cap. Ofgem has now reviewed the cap and will allow suppliers to charge more from April. The cap for those on prepayment meters came into force earlier but has also been reviewed and revised up. Prices are rising because Ofgem is allowing suppliers to charge more to cover the higher wholesale costs they face owing to the higher global price of oil. Wholesale costs account for more than a third of a typical energy bill. The regulator considered the costs faced by suppliers in the six months to the end of January when setting the new cap for April. About Â£74 of the Â£117 increase in the default tariff cap is due to higher wholesale energy costs, it said, with costs of transporting energy and environmental costs also rising for suppliers. Alex Neill, from consumer group Which?, said: ""This eye-watering increase to the price cap will be a shock to the system for people who thought that it would protect them from rising bills."" ""Energy suppliers have traditionally been the ones blasted for blaming price rises on wholesale costs,"" said Richard Neudegg, from price comparison site Uswitch. ""Now, shamefully, Ofgem is doing the same thing, as the reality of energy prices catches up with the political hype."" But Lawrence Slade, chief executive of Energy UK, which represents suppliers, said that energy companies were facing ""drastically rising costs"" which were outside their direct control so it was correct for Ofgem to reflect that when setting the cap. The cap is per unit of energy, not on the total bill. So people who use more energy will still pay more than those who use less. The new cap takes effect in April, after the worst of the winter has gone, so the impact of higher prices might not be as great as it could have been. Ofgem points out that, without the existence of the cap, households would have been paying more. Its analysis suggests that default tariff customers could be paying around Â£75 to Â£100 a year more on average for their energy had the default tariff cap not been introduced, despite the increase just announced. People can also shop around for a cheaper fixed deal. This would make the cap irrelevant for them. Ofgem and consumer groups say switching could save a typical household Â£200 a year, although this differential has narrowed from about Â£300, partly as a result of price bunching after the cap was introduced. The level of the cap is updated every six months, at the start of April and the start of October, this year and next year, and possibly beyond. Forecasts are already suggested that the cap could be lowered next time, saving households money from October. Energy Minister Claire Perry said: ""We were clear when we introduced the cap that prices can go up but also down."" She added that energy suppliers were ""no longer able to rip off customers on poor value tariffs"". But Labour's shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long Bailey, said: ""This government is resting on its laurels while big energy companies are ripping off their customers.""

"Owen Smith and Jeremy Corbyn went head to head in the 2016 Labour leadership contest A leading anti-Brexit Labour MP has said he and a ""lot of people"" are considering leaving the party. Asked if he intended to quit, Pontypridd MP Owen Smith told the BBC: ""I think that's a very good question, and I think it's something that I and a lot of other people are considering"". He and other Labour politicians have criticised Jeremy Corbyn for setting out terms for supporting a Brexit deal. Mr Smith made a failed bid to topple Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader in 2016. Mr Corbyn made him shadow Northern Ireland secretary but sacked him from that role in March last year after Mr Smith called for Labour to back another EU referendum. What's behind Corbyn's Brexit letter to May? UK will not be 'trapped' in backstop - May First ministers press PM for Brexit delay Brexit: All you need to know Asked by BBC Wales on Thursday if he would consider quitting the Labour party, Mr Smith said it was a question ""I and people who hold my views will have to consider"". ""The truth is that Brexit is not compatible with my values. It is a right-wing ideological project, it is a nativist project, it is fuelled by lies and it was delivered deceitfully in 2016. ""I got elected on a set of values which I think Brexit is incompatible with and I got elected to look after the people I grew up with and represent very proudly in Pontypridd. ""I don't think Brexit is reconcilable with those values and my desire to look after people in Ponty."" Mr Smith's comments came after Mr Corbyn wrote to the prime minister with five demands, including joining a customs union, that would need to be met for Labour to back the UK government on Brexit. In the letter, Mr Corbyn offers talks to secure ""a sensible agreement that can win the support of Parliament and bring the country together"". The terms include a ""permanent and comprehensive UK-wide customs union"" aligned with the EU's customs rules but with an agreement ""that includes a UK say on future EU trade deals"". Commenting initially on Twitter, Mr Smith said Brexit, even on Mr Corbyn's terms, ""would still shrink our economy, cost jobs and lost investment, indulge nativist nostalgia and isolationism... and pave the way for another austerity Tory government"". Jeremy Corbyn had what he called a ""serious"" meeting with Theresa May on Brexit last week There was also criticism from other Welsh Labour politicians. Gower MP Tonia Antoniazzi said: ""Nice to be briefed about this @UKLabour @WelshLabour - if at ANY point you would like to consult MPs and also take the Labour Party conference motion into consideration... Just let me know... Cheers..."" Blaenau Gwent assembly member and former Welsh Government minister Alun Davies said Mr Corbyn ""appears to be walking blindly towards a Tory Brexit and political oblivion. Whatever happened to our members determining policy and priorities?!"" But Aberavon MP Stephen Kinnock, who has been promoting what is known as the ""Norway Plus"" model of a close economic partnership with the EU,  welcomed Mr Corbyn's letter, tweeting ""This can break the deadlock."" ""It also throws down the gauntlet to May because it has a seriously good chance of commanding a cross-party majority,"" he said. Wrexham MP Ian Lucas called on fellow Labour MPs to back Mr Corbyn because ""the government and parliament is paralysed because we haven't been able to reach a resolution"". ""There is a consensus for a deal something like Jeremy Corbyn has set out in his letter,"" he said. ""I was elected on a manifesto commitment that we were going to be leaving the European Union. ""Those who supported Remain like me had to accept the referendum result in 2016."" There was also support for Mr Corbyn from the Welsh Government 's Brexit Minister Jeremy Miles, following a meeting of UK and devolved ministers at Westminster to discuss EU matters. ""This morning's letter from the leader of the opposition demonstrates that there is a deal that can gain wider support if the UK government will move on their red line positions,"" he said in statement.

"Theresa May at a community centre in Belfast on Tuesday evening ""It's not good enough to come back next week and say that the negotiations are ongoing,"" a senior Cabinet minister warned. But will the prime minister's travels this week do more than just keep the show on the road? Today she's in Northern Ireland meeting the different political parties, including the DUP - whose votes she needs in Parliament - who are totally opposed to the current version of the controversial backstop, as well as Sinn Fein, who are just as adamant that it must remain. Then on Thursday, Theresa May will be in Brussels, asking - again - for the EU to amend the policy, seeking either a time limit or a legal upgrade to the promise that both sides will only use it if they really, really, really have to, and they don't expect it to last forever. In short, today's a chance for the PM to test out what she'll ask for, tomorrow, an opportunity to sell it as hard as she can in Brussels. Remember, she has asked for these changes before and been turned down. And she's heard before from both sides in Northern Ireland how dug in their positions are. So can she do anything other than take one more turn around the same carousel while the clock ticks down? PM in Belfast for Brexit deadlock talks New ideas for the Brexit border backstop Brexit: All you need to know The difference on her travels this time is that it's not just the prime minister pleading with the EU to budge, warning that this deal hypothetically might not wash. It's the first time she'll meet the EU top brass since the plan that she agreed with them was thumpingly rejected by Parliament. And the first time too she has some evidence to show that the deal could, in theory, pass through the Commons if the backstop was eventually changed. That's what last week's drama was all about - the so-called Brady amendment (which already feels a lifetime ago) passing Parliament paved the way for the prime minister to have another go at getting changes because it allows her to say to the EU, ""look, all those grumpy MPs could come on board, if only you are willing to give me this one thing - I know that you have said no in multiple languages, but it is the only way this is going to work"". That's why today will also be important for the Irish leader, who has his own talks in Brussels. Until now, Leo Varadkar has staked his political reputation on sticking to the backstop. Don't hold your breath for any signs of concessions from him later. One source said they wouldn't be likely to move until the ""92nd minute"". But with the risk of no-deal looming larger, by simple virtue of time marching on, perhaps behind closed doors the EU's dealmakers are looking for ways out. That's why this week, for example, Martin Selymayr did discuss with MPs whether they could accept a souped-up legal version of promises that have already been made. That's not the same as putting it on the table as an official proposal of course. But the fact that such a conversation has taken place matters. It seems rather optimistic though that, by the end of tomorrow, the prime minister will have conclusive proof that those kinds of noises-off make a concrete deal, or that the legal fixes being proposed by the Attorney General at home have been convincingly signed off by the EU. And all the while a group of Remainers and Brexiteers are working with government officials on their hoped-for alternative, the so-called Malthouse Compromise. While a tweaked deal with the EU could get some reluctant Brexiteers on board, some are hardening around the idea that it has to be this plan now, or there won't be a plan they can back at all. One key member of the powerful ERG group of Tory Brexiteer MPs told me this is ""the only show in town"", claiming that if No 10 doesn't ultimately buy their plan -which you can read about here- then the government could fall. That's quite a threat to wave around. No 10 is trying to maintain the idea that this could be the route they follow. The simple truth is they need the votes of those MPs who back it. But it's clear in the first instance that No 10 is trying to change the backstop in the deal they have sweated over for two years, rather than make a more significant shift. What Theresa May might need from the next 48 hours though is proof that the EU could move in her direction. Evidence to present back to Parliament next week that, while there might not be a deal fresh with wet ink, there is at least a proposal that's being taken seriously, that paves the way for another vote on a government-friendly amendment that can be used to signify numbers moving in her direction. If she comes back with nothing at all to show, nor any encouragement for those strongly pushing for change, then in her colleague's words, it might ""not be good enough"" at all.

"This video can not be played Theresa May: ""I am clear that I am going to deliver Brexit, deliver it on time."" Theresa May has told EU leaders she can get the Brexit deal through Parliament if they give her legally-binding changes to it. The UK prime minister - who also vowed to deliver Brexit ""on time"" - was speaking after a series of meetings with top EU officials in Brussels. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker again ruled out the kind of changes Mrs May wants to see. But the two sides agreed to further talks to break the deadlock. Mrs May said she had also spoken to European Council President Donald Tusk about hiscomments on Wednesday about there being a ""special place in hell""for those who campaigned for Brexit without a plan to deliver it safely. Laura Kuenssberg: More talks pledge helps May in perception war EU's Verhofstadt welcomes Corbyn's offer What's behind Corbyn's Brexit letter to May? Brexit: All you need to know She said Mr Tusk's language ""was not helpful"" and had ""caused widespread dismay in the United Kingdom"". Mrs May said she had told him he should be ""focusing"" on working with the UK to get a Brexit deal. Mr Tusk tweeted that there was ""no breakthrough in sight"" following his talks with the UK prime minister. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mrs May said she had ""set out very clearly the position from Parliament that we must have legally binding changes to the withdrawal agreement in order to deal with Parliament's concerns over the backstop"". That, ""together with the other work that we're doing on workers' rights and other issues, will deliver a stable majority in Parliament,"" she said. Mr Juncker ""underlined that the EU27 will not reopen the withdrawal agreement"" in their talks, according to a joint statement released by the two sides. But he ""expressed his openness"" to adding words to the non-binding future relationship document - that also has to be backed by MPs - to be ""more ambitious in terms of content and speed"". Did anything change? Not that much. But for Downing Street, this has not been a pointless stop-off in the almost never-ending Brexit adventure. Because, while there hasn't been a breakthrough, the EU has agreed to more talks, which at least opens up the possibility of discussing the changes to the troubled backstop that has caused such political difficulty. It might not sound like much, but ""we can talk"", is at least a different message to ""this is over"" . Read more from Laura Meanwhile, Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay and EU negotiator Michel Barnier will hold talks in Strasbourg on Monday, as the EU and UK Brexit negotiating teams discuss proposed changes to the deal. Downing Street said these talks would cover ""alternative arrangements"" for the Irish border, as called for by MPs in a vote last week. A spokeswoman said other UK ministers, such as Attorney General Geoffrey Cox could be involved. Mr Cox is ""working on working on possible ways in which legal texts could be drafted, that gave effect to the objective we want,"" Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington told the BBC. Mrs May and Mr Juncker will meet again before the end of February, to review progress. The prime minister is expected to put the deal to a vote in the Commons towards the end of February. Jeremy Corbyn has listed five demands, including a UK-wide customs union Jeremy Corbyn has written to the prime minister setting out his party's price for supporting a Brexit deal and to offer talks to secure ""a sensible agreement that can win the support of Parliament and bring the country together"". The Labour leader's five demands include a ""permanent and comprehensive UK-wide customs union"" aligned with the EU's customs rules but with an agreement ""that includes a UK say on future EU trade deals"". Mr Corbyn also wants close alignment with the EU single market and ""dynamic alignment on rights and protections"" for workers so that UK standards do not fall behind those of the EU. He also proposes participation in EU agencies and funding programmes, and agreements on security and keeping access to the European Arrest Warrant. The letter does not mention previous demands that any deal must deliver the ""exact same benefits"" that membership of the single market and customs union currently does - effectively scrapping the party's ""six tests"" that had been its Brexit policy. The BBC's Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg said Labour's shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer would be meeting Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington to discuss the proposals. Owen Smith says he and others are thinking of quitting Labour But the move was met with dismay by Labour members of the People's Vote campaign for another EU referendum, who accused Mr Corbyn of going back on his commitment, made at the party's conference, to back a public vote if he can't force a general election. Labour MP Owen Smith, who made a failed leadership bid in 2016, has told the BBC he and others were thinking of quitting the party over Mr Corbyn's Brexit stance. But Labour's Stephen Kinnock, who backs the ""Norway Plus"" model of a close economic partnership with the EU, welcomed Mr Corbyn's letter, tweeting: ""This can break the deadlock."" Mr Lidington said he and Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay would be willing to discuss Labour's proposals with Sir Keir and other frontbenchers. But he said Labour's call to have a say in trade deals while being in a customs union with the EU was ""wishful thinking"", because Brussels had ruled it out. The European Parliament's Brexit co-ordinator Guy Verhofstadt welcomed Mr Corbyn's proposals, saying ""the broadest possible majority"" was needed for a Brexit deal in the UK and ""cross-party co-operation is the way forward"". It was also backed by Conservative MP Sir Oliver Letwin, who wants to see the UK in a Norway-style relationship with the EU after Brexit. Allow Twitter content?

"There's pretty much zero expectation that any real progress will be made on Thursday when Theresa May comes back to Brussels looking for changes to the backstop - that fall-back guarantee written into the Brexit deal to keep the Irish border open. Nonetheless, we'll inevitably be poring over every word, every tone, every hint of body language on display after the prime minister's meetings with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and the President of the European Council Donald Tusk. Especially Donald Tusk -after his inflammatory remarks on the eve of Theresa May's visit,musing about which part of hell the architects of Brexit might be consigned to. What comments might he have up his sleeve for the prime minister? Brexit: Donald Tusk's planned outburst All you need to know about Brexit Tusk 'has no manners' I suspect - despite his reputation in Brussels as quite an emotional politician, keen on the limelight, colourful with words - that some of his European peers may have had a word in his ear that now is really, really not the right time. This video can not be played Donald Tusk: ""Special place in hell"" for those without Brexit plan Don't get me wrong, Mr Tusk is not alone in Europe in his frustration at leading Brexiteers' unrealistic promises (that the trade deal with the EU would be the easiest and quickest in history, that it would be concluded before the end of the UK's exit negotiations, that the UK could leave the customs union and single market and still enjoy frictionless trade with the EU and more...). EU leaders are irritated too that - as they see it - the UK voted for Brexit but keeps looking to Brussels to come up with ways to make its exit workable and painless. But most senior European politicians are keeping those thoughts quiet - in public. Considering the tortuous political dance Theresa May is trying to pull off in Westminster, they realise outspokenly critical EU opinions may not be helpful if, in the end, they want to get this Brexit deal done with the UK. And they do. The alternative - a no-deal Brexit - would be costly for them economically and politically. So - Mr Tusk's inflammatory comments aside - the intended EU message to Theresa May is: our door remains open. We are in listening mode but there is already a negotiated Brexit deal on the table. If you now want to make changes then it's up to you to ensure they are palatable both to the EU and to a comfortable majority of your MPs. And therein lies the prime minister's devilish dilemma.

"David Mearns is a renowned marine scientist and oceanographer David Mearns has become the face of the private search for the plane which was carrying Argentine footballer Emiliano Sala and pilot David Ibbotson. The Piper Malibu N264DB, which went missing on 21 January on its way from Nantes, France, to Cardiff, wasfound in the English Channel on Sunday. Mr Mearns stepped in to lead a privately-funded search, and located the wreckage within a couple of hours. But who is the man nicknamed the ""shipwreck hunter""? Found: The plane wreck that could solve a 50-year-old mystery Sonar mapping project highlights sunken ships Lottery grant to fund WWI shipwreck search project American-born Mr Mearns has helped solve a number of major maritime mysteries. The UK-based marine scientist and oceanographer led the successful hunt forHMS Hoodand claims to have spearheaded a further 20 historic discoveries. Using sonar technology and remote-controlled submersibles, the expeditions have also set records by finding wrecks at extreme depths. HMS Hood during a dockyard refit at Portsmouth in 1930 The Bismarck sent up a wall of ""plunging fire"" which penetrated the weak deck armour of HMS Hood when it was sunk in the Denmark Strait One of Britain's greatest battleships, Hood was sunk by the German navy's Bismarck in May 1941, killing 1,415 men. HMS Hood's remains were found at a depth of 3,000m in the Denmark Strait, between Greenland and Iceland, in 2001. He has continued to make significant discoveries around the world with his company,Blue Water Recoveries,external. In 2008, Mr Mearns led a successful search for the HMAS Sydney, pictured here before it was sunk in November 1941 In 2008 Mr Mearns led the successful search forHMAS Sydney,external, an Australian navy battlecruiser sunk by the Germans off the continent's west coast in November 1941, killing more than 700. And in 2015 his company announced they had found a wreck believed to be theEsmerelda, a ship fromVasco Da Gama's fleet thought to have sunk off the coast of Oman in May 1503. Mr Mearns has also co-ordinated searches for some more modern nautical enigmas. In the early 1990s, he assisted a criminal probe into the foundering of the Lucona, a cargo ship blown up in the Indian Ocean in 1997, killing six men, as part of an insurance scam. He has also been instrumental in searches that have defied the odds. They include locating the SS Rio Grande, the deepest shipwreck ever found. The World War Two German supply ship, sunk by the Americans in 1944, was discovered around three and a half miles below the waves of the south Atlantic Ocean in 1996.

"Emiliano Sala (left) was on board a plane being flown by pilot David Ibbotson Wreckage from a plane carrying Cardiff City footballer Emiliano Sala has been discovered in the English Channel. The Piper Malibu N264DB was lost on 21 January on its way from Nantes, France, to Cardiff, with the Argentine striker and pilot David Ibbotson on board. David Mearns, who led a privately-funded search for the aircraft, said it was located off Guernsey on Sunday. He said: ""All I will say is that there is a substantial amount of wreckage on the seabed."" David Mearns offered to help look for the plane after a fundraising effort by Mr Sala's family Speaking onRadio 4's Today programmeon Monday, Mr Mearns said: ""We located the wreckage of the plane on the seabed at a depth of about 63m within the first couple of hours [of searching]."" He said the plane was identified by sonar, before a submersible with cameras was sent underwater and was able to confirm it was the plane. ""They saw the registration number and the biggest surprise is that most of the plane is there,"" he added. Mr Mearns's private search has now been stood down and the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) is at the site working to recover the plane. He said further investigations by the AAIB would be conducted over the next two days in order to determine how it will attempt a recovery operation. Who is David Mearns?

Speaking to Argentinian broadcaster Cronica TV, Sala's father Horacio said:  ""I cannot believe it. This is a dream. A bad dream. I am desperate."" Mr Mearns said he was in contact with the Sala family after the wreckage was located and said they ""desperately want that plane to be recovered. They feel that is the pathway for them to get the answers that they need to have"". He added he was compelled to help to search for the plane after seeing an emotional plea by Sala's sister Romina. ""I just felt that girl needed help and that's why I offered my assistance,"" he said. ""I am a football fan. Cardiff is not my city, but I follow football. I felt very badly for her, I wanted to help. I just happen to be a person with this experience and skill and I could do that. ""To add to it this was a man in the prime of his life. It is just so tremendously sad."" Cardiff had signed Sala for a club record of Â£15m and he was due to start training last month. The 28-year-old striker and Mr Ibbotson, 59, from Crowle, North Lincolnshire, were travelling from Nantes, where he had previously played, when the flight lost contact with air traffic controllers.

Cushions believed to be from the planewere found on a beach near Surtainville, on France's Cotentin Peninsula, last week. There were emotional tributes to the footballeras Cardiff played their first home game since the disappearance on Saturday. The club's manager, Neil Warnock, saidhe felt Sala was ""with"" his teamas they beat Bournemouth 2-0 in the Premier League. An online appeal had raised Â£324,000 (371,000 euros) for the private search, which began on Sunday. Working jointly with the AAIB, Mr Mearns's ship and another search vessel, the Geo Ocean III, began combing a four square mile area of the channel, 24 nautical miles north of Guernsey. Geo Ocean III remains at the wreckage location off Guernsey The AAIB ship has remained at the site where the missing Piper plane was located, to deploy an underwater search vehicle to make a visual confirmation. A recovery operation will then begin. Former air crash investigator Tony Cable told BBC Breakfast on Monday that any examination of the wreckage after it is recovered would take ""considerable time"". ""Certainly the damage can tell you the sort of altitude and vertical speed, horizontal speed that it hit the water."" He added that there may also be signs of anything that was not working properly. ""The difficulty is if you don't have signs of problems before the crash, you're left looking at possible reasons then which are not a failure of the aircraft. The absence of any problem leaves you somewhat in the realm of speculation."" Officials at the AAIB said they expected to give an update on the operation on Monday morning.

"Steve Perry, left, and climbing partner Andy Nisbet Two men who lost their lives in a Scottish Highlands mountaineering trip have been described as giants of the climbing world. Aberdeen-born Andy Nisbet and Inverness-based Steve Perry got into difficulty on Ben Hope on Tuesday. Their bodies were recovered from the mountainin Sutherland on Wednesday. Fellow climbers paid tribute to the pair, who were highly experienced and regarded, with one saying they were ""gargantuan characters"". Mr Nisbet, who helped establish 1,000 winter climbing routes, was lauded for his ""boundless enthusiasm"" and ""pioneering attitude"". Mr Perry, an accomplished hillwalker, mountain biker and climber, was originally from Lancaster and grew up in Todmorden in Yorkshire. It is believed that the men, who were regular climbing partners, had finished their ascent and fell while on the upper slopes of the 927m (3,041ft) Munro classed mountain. Both were highly experienced and Mr Nisbet's appearance and climbing style earned him the nicknames ""Honey Monster"" and ""The Droid"". At the 2014 Fort William Mountain Festival hereceived the Scottish Award for Excellence in Mountain Culture. Information gathered on climbs by the 65-year-old former Scottish Mountaineering Club president appeared in Scottish Mountaineering Club guidebooks. The bodies of the men were found by a Coastguard helicopter crew on the north-west side of the mountain Munros are Scottish mountains above 3,000ft (914.4 m). The name came from explorer Sir Hugh Munro who made it his mission to create a list of peaks greater than 3,000ft There are 282 Munros and they include Britain's highest mountain Ben Nevis and peaks in Skye. Ben Hope is Scotland's most northerly Munro. Andy Nisbet and Steve Perry are believed to have been establishing new winter climbing routes on the mountain. Munro bagging: How to climb Scotland's mountains Mr Perry, 47, was also a highly experienced climber. Mountaineer and broadcaster Cameron McNeish said he was ""utterly devastated"" at the news of the men's deaths. He told BBC Radio Scotland: ""They were both gargantuan characters."" Mr McNeish said climbers knew there would be risks tackling Scotland's mountains in winter and the pair would have ""managed the risks as well as they could"". This video can not be played Climbing âpioneerâ Andy Nisbet, one of two men who died on Ben Hope, spoke about his love for mountaineering in a 2014 interview. He added that ""sometimes accidents happen"". Giving his tribute, David Whalley, a former RAF mountain rescue team leader, said: ""I knew Andy very well. He was roughly the same age as me, but what an incredible mountaineer in every aspect. ""He was the most active prolific mountaineer that Scotland has ever produced. ""He has climbed over 1,000-plus new winter routes all over Scotland - his enthusiasm was dynamic. ""Never in the history of Scottish mountaineering has anyone been so prolific or enthusiastic and introduced so many to the mountains especially in winter."" Mountain rescue teams, the Coastguard and police were involved in an initial search for the men and the later recovery of their bodies A number of mountain rescue teams were involved in the Ben Hope operation Writing in a UK Climbing blog, climber Natalie Berry, who was winner of 2016's Scottish Youth Ambassador for Mountain Culture award, said the men had a ""strong"" climbing partnership. Mountaineering Scotland, an organisation representing outdoor pursuits enthusiasts, said it was ""shocked and saddened"" to learn of the climbers' deaths. A spokesman said: ""Andy was popular and well respected in the Scottish climbing scene with a vast knowledge and experience of Scotland's mountains. ""He was a prolific climber of new routes and his successful partnership with Steve had resulted in a number of first ascents on Ben Hope in recent years. Andy Nisbet in an image released at the time he won Scottish Award for Excellence in Mountain Culture ""Steve Perry was also a well-known mountaineer, who had completed an on-foot round of the Munros in the winter of 2005-06 and was a keen climber in both summer and winter, who listed new routing in winter Scotland as one of his favourite climbing experiences. ""Their deaths are a huge loss to the mountaineering community in Scotland and, in particular, we send our condolences to family and friends of both Andy and Steve."" Mountaineering Scotland also paid tribute to mountain rescue teams and the Coastguard who were involved in responding to the accident. Assynt Mountain Rescue Team was supported by Stornoway and Inverness Coastguard helicopter crews, police and also Dundonnell and Lossiemouth mountain rescue teams in recovering the climbers' bodies. Rescue teams and the Coastguard had earlier been involved in a search for the two men. The Assynt team said: ""Our sincere condolences and thoughts go out to all the family and friends, many of whom are involved in mountain rescue.""

"This video can not be played Bank of England Governor, Mark Carney The Bank of England expects growth this year to be the slowest since 2009 when the economy was in recession. It is forecasting growth of 1.2% this year, down from its previous forecast of 1.7% made in November. The Bank said it had seen further evidence that businesses were being cautious in the run-up to Brexit, including evidence from its own survey of firms. As expected the Bank kept interest rates on hold at 0.75%. The Bank put the fall in growth down to a decline in business investment and housebuilding, as well as a halving of the growth rate in exports. The UK was also being hit by slower-than-expected growth in the eurozone and China,the Bank said in its Quarterly Inflation Report.,external ""Growth appears to have slowed at the end of 2018 and is expected to remain subdued in the near term,"" it said. The Bank even sees a one-in-four chance of the economy slipping into recession in the second half of this year. Brexit stalemate scars prosperity, says Bank There has been an ""intensification"" of Brexit uncertainties, the Bank said. Its survey of 208 firms showed that half had started putting plans in place for a no-deal Brexit. The survey also showed that a fifth had taken on extra warehouse space It also noted a sharp fall in business investment at the end of last year. ""Uncertainty appears to have risen recently, and may have weighed on investment by more than had been expected in August,"" the Bank said. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said: ""The fog of Brexit is causing short term volatility in the economic data, and more fundamentally, it is creating a series of tensions in the economy, tensions for business."" Interest rates remain at 0.75%, where they have been since the Bank of England last raised in interest rates in August. Many economists think that once the uncertainty over Brexit is lifted then the economy will accelerate and the Bank will have to raise interest rates to stop it overheating. However, recent economic data has indicated weakness in the UK economy. Growth in the service sector, the biggest part of the economy, appeared to have stalled in January,according to closely-watched survey of purchasing managers. Samuel Tombs, an economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, predicts that the Bank will raise rates once this year and twice in 2020. Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said: ""We still think that a decent rebound in GDP growth, should a Brexit deal be reached, will result in interest rates rising further than the Bank and the financial markets assume."" Moves in interest rates are important to the 3.5 million people with variable or tracker mortgages. Even a small rise of 0.25% can add hundreds of pounds to their annual mortgage costs. ""It's a very good time for people looking to borrow,"" said Andrew Montlake, a director at Coreco, a mortgage broker. He said there had been a lot of competition among lenders in January, with some very good deals for five-year fixed mortgage deals. Some lenders are offering five-year fixed deals at below 2%, he said. Concern over Brexit has held back some people from borrowing. ""There is a lot of pent-up demand,"" said Mr Montlake. Savers who depend on higher interest rates to boost their incomes will be disappointed that rates have stayed on hold for a sixth consecutive month. While the Bank cut its growth forecast it also noted the strength of the labour market, where the unemployment rate is currently 4%. The rate at which people are switching to new jobs is only slightly below the level hit before the financial crisis of 2007. That switching suggests that employers are having to compete to attract staff, the Bank said. It also noted a pick-up in the average number of hours worked at the end of last year and firmer wage growth. The Bank thinks that wage growth will increase in the coming years as the UK's unemployment rate continues to fall. The main reason the Bank thinks underlying inflation pressures will grow is that wage growth will rise. Britain's unemployment rate has hit its lowest level in more than 40 years. The Bank predicts that earnings will rise by more than 3% a year over the next three years.

"Germany's competition regulator has told Facebook to substantially restrict how it collects and combines data about its users unless they give it explicit consent. The watchdog has carried out a probe,externalinto the social network following concerns that members were unaware of the extent of the firm's activities. It covered data gathered from third-party sources as well as via Facebook's other apps, including Instagram. The US firm has said it will appeal. Specifically, the FCO has ruled that: Facebook's various services - including WhatsApp and Instagram - can continue to collect data, but they cannot combine the information with a user's main Facebook account unless the member gives their voluntary consent collecting data from third-party websites and assigning it to a Facebook user's account is likewise only allowed if that member has given the firm permission The watchdog added that an ""obligatory tick on the box"" to agree to all the company's terms was not a sufficient basis for ""such intensive data processing"". The ruling only applies to the firm's activities in Germany, but is likely to influence other regulators. Facebook claims the Federal Cartel Office has overstepped the mark by pursuing a data privacy matter that Facebook says falls under the remit of another regulator. It has one month to challenge the ruling before it becomes legally effective. If the order is upheld, the company must develop technical solutions to ensure it complies within four months. If it refused to do so, it could in theory be fined up to 10% of its annual revenues. The FCO's justification for the case is that it believes Facebook abused its market dominance to gather the data. ""In future, Facebook will no longer be allowed to force its users to agree to the practically unrestricted collection and assigning of non-Facebook data to their Facebook user accounts,"" explained Andreas Mundt, the FCO's president. ""The combination of data sources substantially contributed to the fact that Facebook was able to build a unique database for each individual user and thus to gain market power."" The ruling could affect the firm's use of the Like and Share buttons on external sites, which lets Facebook track each visitor's internet protocol (IP) address, web browser name and version, and other details that can be used to identify them. This is true, even if users never click on the buttons. Likewise, the Facebook Login, which lets users avoid having to type in a unique username and password for each service, shares similar device-identifying information. Does Facebook get an unfair press? Facebook adviser criticises 'lax' child checks Facebook broke German privacy laws, court rules In addition,the company runs a scheme called the Facebook Pixel,,externalwhich adds code to a third-party site to let its owners track whether ads run on Facebook converted the people who saw them into buyers. The FCO was also concerned by the fact that Facebook shares some of the data gathered by Instagram, WhatsApp and its other services with its namesake platform. The firm recently announced plans to go further and integrate the technology behind the chat services of Instagram, WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger. Facebook defends such practices on the grounds that: they help it show more relevant ads to consumers they help advertisers measure how successful their campaigns are they make it easier for Facebook to identify fake accounts,combat terrorism,externaland otherwise protect its users In a blog, it added that the FCO had overlooked steps it had already taken to be compliant with the EU's General Data Protection Regulation, which came into force last year. ""The GDPR specifically empowers data protection regulators - not competition authorities - to determine whether companies have lived up to their responsibilities,""it said,external. ""And data protection regulators certainly have the expertise to make those conclusions."" ""The [FCO] order threatens to undermine this, providing different rights to people based on the size of the companies they do business with."" But the UK-based campaign group Privacy International has said that if the German ruling holds, Facebook should extend the same rights to its other users. ""Privacy harms are directly caused by the business models of companies in dominant positions, which can impose excessive collection of data on people who have become 'captive users',"" said the group's head of advocacy and policy Tomaso Falchetta. ""Facebook should unify its privacy protections for its operations globally."" The FCO is also pursuing a separate probe into Amazon. It is exploring whether the retail giant has acted illegally in its relations with the third-party sellers who use its platform.

"This video can not be played Equine flu: Inside the Newmarket laboratory that detected the outbreak An outbreak of equine flu has led to British horse racing meetings being cancelled and fears over the impact on next month's Cheltenham Festival. All four fixtures on Thursday were called off by the British Horseracing Authority (BHA) after three vaccinated horses tested positive for the disease. Trainer Donald McCain has confirmed the horses came from his Cheshire stables. Horses from the infected yard raced on Wednesday, potentially exposing a significant number of horses. British-trained runners have been barred from running in Ireland. Jump racing's showpiece four-day Cheltenham Festival is due to start in 33 days, on 12 March. And while it is not known what the precise impact might be, the situation has echoes of the foot-and-mouth crisis 18 years ago, which began at a similar time of year and eventually led to the meeting being called off. Announced late on Wednesday that Thursday's racing at Huntingdon, in Cambridgeshire; Doncaster (South Yorkshire), Chelmsford (Essex) and Welsh track Ffos Las was cancelled. A decision on whether Friday and Saturday's fixtures - at Newcastle and Southwell - can go ahead is not expected until Thursday evening. Wolverhampton Racecourse has said its meeting on Saturday will not take place as a horse from the infected yard ran there this week and a deep clean has been ordered. Racing is not permitted for four days afterwards. Three horses vaccinated against the virus tested positive on Wednesday night at the Cheshire stables of Donald McCain, the son of the late Ginger McCain - who trained the legendary Red Rum to win the Grand National a record three times in the 1970s. The alarm was raised as horses from his yard had raced on Wednesday at Ayr, Ludlow and Wolverhampton. Brant Dunshea, chief regulatory officer at the BHA, said there ""is a potential risk"" that racing could be suspended for days or even weeks but added that a decision would not be made without ""thinking through all the consequences"". Leading Irish trainer Gordon Elliott, who had five runners at Ayr has isolated his horses in a facility 15 miles from his main operation. In a statement issued through the National Trainers Federation, McCain said: ""I have been aware of the recent news about equine influenza outbreaks in France and Ireland, and over the last couple of days, I have been concerned about the health status of a small number of horses in the yard. ""Their welfare is at the front of our minds, so at my request, our veterinary surgeon has examined them regularly and we have followed his advice on testing and treatment. ""It was by following this protocol that the positive results for equine flu came to light yesterday evening. ""The BHA were contacted immediately and we are liaising closely with them about bio-security and management of all the horses at Bankhouse. Bankhouse follows all the available advice on disease control and all our horses are fully inoculated."" He added: ""We are scrupulous about observing the health status of horses in our care and taking the necessary steps to treat any condition that may affect them. It follows we would never race any horses that we could have known were infected. There are no known consequences for humans exposed to equine flu ""Over the last two months, all potential runners have been scoped and their blood checked within 36 hours of their races to ensure that only healthy horses compete for the yard. ""When new horses arrive at our yard we, as much as possible, try to keep them separate but at this stage cannot know if the infection came from recent arrivals or from horses returning from racing. ""We have three confirmed cases and this morning have taken blood and swabs from all the others for testing."" David Sykes, director of equine health and welfare at the BHA, added: ""We would like to thank Donald McCain for his co-operation in this matter, and for the responsible manner in which he has dealt with this issue, under the guidance of his veterinary surgeon. ""He has acted professionally with the interests of the racing industry and the health of his horses as his priority."" Irish racing continues but without British runners Horses that have contracted equine flu can develop a high fever, coughing, nasal discharge and sometimes swelling of the lymph nodes. The incubation period is usually days but recovery can take weeks, or even months. There are no known consequences for humans exposed to the disease. The BHA said there was ""significant concern over welfare and the potential spread of the disease"" and it was attempting to prevent further cases. It said ""quarantine and biosecurity measures"" are being put in place and horse movements restricted. ""The full extent of potential exposure is unknown and we are working quickly to understand as much as we can to assist our decision making,"" it added. Since the start of 2019, there have been seven outbreaks of equine flu - in Essex, Cheshire, Derbyshire, Lincolnshire, Yorkshire and Suffolk. The two cases in Suffolk involved thoroughbreds - one centred on eight vaccinated two-year-old horses and the other was six unvaccinated animals. This news has rocked horse racing at a time when anticipation is building before the Cheltenham Festival, and the bloodstock industry prepares for the start of the breeding season. ""As you can imagine, a normal race meeting will have circa 70-100 racehorses stabled in a close proximity from all parts of the country, all housed together for a day and then they all go back home to their own yard, so it could be catastrophic,"" trainer Seamus Mullins told BBC Radio 5 live. It is unclear at this stage the potential effect on future fixtures  with the 'Super Saturday' meeting at Newbury in Berkshire on 9 February - where last year's Gold Cup winner Native River is due to run - the next high-profile fixture. With just over four weeks left to the Festival, the countdown is on for jockeys, trainers, owners and punters, with many leading contenders earmarked for prep races over the next 10 days. ""If it was a long-term stoppage it would hit racing very, very hard both with the day-to-day training of the horses, but more importantly it would financially hit the industry very, very hard,"" said Mullins. ""Every day without racing is a loss on income for everybody, from the stable lads in the yard, to the jockeys, trainers, owners, bookmakers, racecourses, it would be very, very serious."" Equine influenza is a highly infectious disease that affects horses, mules and donkeys, occurring globally caused by strains of the Influenza A virus. It is the most potentially damaging of the respiratory viruses that occur in UK horses and disease symptoms in non-immune animals include high fever, coughing and nasal discharge. The outbreak at the infected yard follows the identification of a number of equine influenza cases across Europe and the UK, including several in vaccinated horses. Following the recent outbreaks, guidance was sent to racehorse trainers to inform them that all horses that have not had a vaccination against equine flu within the last six months should receive a booster vaccination, and that trainers should be extra-vigilant. However, equine influenza can be highly contagious and - unlike other infectious diseases - can be airborne over reasonable distances as well as be transmitted indirectly, including via people. ""It's very similar to human flu; the symptoms are the same and the horses feel the same,"" said Mullins. ""You get a high temperature, a nasal discharge and eventually you get coughing and the horses feel rough. It's similar to humans - but they get over it."" Cornelius Lysaght, horse racing correspondent There is such a feeling of deja vu here, 18 years almost to the day since I recall being at Wincanton races when news first emerged of the outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the UK in 2001. Racing was stopped for a while, and eventually the Cheltenham Festival was called off altogether. There's no suggestion that this incident will cause the same kind of disruption, but that said there's big element of uncertainty about what happens next, and any further shut-down - Cheltenham is again looming - would clearly have a considerable effect on the sport but on all the ancillary industries that go with it.

"The number of fatal stabbings in England and Wales last year was the highest since records began in 1946, official figures show. There were 285 killings by a knife or sharp instrument in the 12 months ending March 2018,Office for National Statistics analysis shows,external. The ONS says one in four (71) of all victims (285) were men aged 18-24. The figures also show 25% of victims were black - the highest proportion since data was first collected in 1997. The figures show a 45% increase in the number of victims aged 16-24 and a 23% increase in those aged 25-34. While gun crime was lower than 10 years ago,it was at its highest for a decade in four English counties- West Yorkshire, Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Cheshire. Suspects convicted of all 252 killings in the year to March 2018, were most likely to be aged 16-24 The worst place for killings in the UK, proportionately, was in Inverclyde, Scotland There were 132 people killed in London -the highest for 10 yearsif you exclude those killed in terror attacks However, this means there were 6.6 homicides per 100,000 people in the capital, compared with 14 per 100,000 in Inverclyde Two London boroughs were named in the 10 worst places for killings In Scotland,latest official figures for 2017-18,externalshow the number of all killings fell by six to to 59 - its joint lowest level since 1976 Police Scotland figures show a knife or sharp instrument was used in 34 of them Twenty eight of these victims were male and the victims were most likely to be aged 31-50 The latest figures for Scotland are expected to be published in October 2019 This video can not be played Teach kids the realities of knife crime A third of female victims were killed by partners or ex-partners, compared with 1% of male victims Of male victims, 35% were killed by a stranger, compared with 17% of female victims One in four men were killed by friends or acquaintances, compared with 7% of female victims By home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw The figures on homicide do not generally vary hugely from year-to-year, which is why the steep increase in fatal stabbings to an all-time high is particularly striking. It provides further evidence that knife crime is arguably the greatest law enforcement challenge facing the Home Office, police and communities across England and Wales. Ministers have blamed much of the rise in serious violence on disputes between drug gangs. The figures provide some support for this with a slight increase in drug-related killings: 44% now compared with 40% in 2008. In the past two years, 58% of suspects and 35% of victims were dealers or users. However, drugs are unlikely to account for the entire rise in cases of murder and manslaughter which, as a proportion of population, is back to levels it was a decade ago but not as high as in the early 2000s.

"Germany's competition regulator has told Facebook to substantially restrict how it collects and combines data about its users unless they give it explicit consent. The watchdog has carried out a probe,externalinto the social network following concerns that members were unaware of the extent of the firm's activities. It covered data gathered from third-party sources as well as via Facebook's other apps, including Instagram. The US firm has said it will appeal. Specifically, the FCO has ruled that: Facebook's various services - including WhatsApp and Instagram - can continue to collect data, but they cannot combine the information with a user's main Facebook account unless the member gives their voluntary consent collecting data from third-party websites and assigning it to a Facebook user's account is likewise only allowed if that member has given the firm permission The watchdog added that an ""obligatory tick on the box"" to agree to all the company's terms was not a sufficient basis for ""such intensive data processing"". The ruling only applies to the firm's activities in Germany, but is likely to influence other regulators. Facebook claims the Federal Cartel Office has overstepped the mark by pursuing a data privacy matter that Facebook says falls under the remit of another regulator. It has one month to challenge the ruling before it becomes legally effective. If the order is upheld, the company must develop technical solutions to ensure it complies within four months. If it refused to do so, it could in theory be fined up to 10% of its annual revenues. The FCO's justification for the case is that it believes Facebook abused its market dominance to gather the data. ""In future, Facebook will no longer be allowed to force its users to agree to the practically unrestricted collection and assigning of non-Facebook data to their Facebook user accounts,"" explained Andreas Mundt, the FCO's president. ""The combination of data sources substantially contributed to the fact that Facebook was able to build a unique database for each individual user and thus to gain market power."" The ruling could affect the firm's use of the Like and Share buttons on external sites, which lets Facebook track each visitor's internet protocol (IP) address, web browser name and version, and other details that can be used to identify them. This is true, even if users never click on the buttons. Likewise, the Facebook Login, which lets users avoid having to type in a unique username and password for each service, shares similar device-identifying information. Does Facebook get an unfair press? Facebook adviser criticises 'lax' child checks Facebook broke German privacy laws, court rules In addition,the company runs a scheme called the Facebook Pixel,,externalwhich adds code to a third-party site to let its owners track whether ads run on Facebook converted the people who saw them into buyers. The FCO was also concerned by the fact that Facebook shares some of the data gathered by Instagram, WhatsApp and its other services with its namesake platform. The firm recently announced plans to go further and integrate the technology behind the chat services of Instagram, WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger. Facebook defends such practices on the grounds that: they help it show more relevant ads to consumers they help advertisers measure how successful their campaigns are they make it easier for Facebook to identify fake accounts,combat terrorism,externaland otherwise protect its users In a blog, it added that the FCO had overlooked steps it had already taken to be compliant with the EU's General Data Protection Regulation, which came into force last year. ""The GDPR specifically empowers data protection regulators - not competition authorities - to determine whether companies have lived up to their responsibilities,""it said,external. ""And data protection regulators certainly have the expertise to make those conclusions."" ""The [FCO] order threatens to undermine this, providing different rights to people based on the size of the companies they do business with."" But the UK-based campaign group Privacy International has said that if the German ruling holds, Facebook should extend the same rights to its other users. ""Privacy harms are directly caused by the business models of companies in dominant positions, which can impose excessive collection of data on people who have become 'captive users',"" said the group's head of advocacy and policy Tomaso Falchetta. ""Facebook should unify its privacy protections for its operations globally."" The FCO is also pursuing a separate probe into Amazon. It is exploring whether the retail giant has acted illegally in its relations with the third-party sellers who use its platform.

"Greg James made his breakfast show debut in August last year More than 230,000 extra listeners have been tuning in to the Radio 1 breakfast show since Greg James took over from Nick Grimshaw in August. According to industry body Rajar, his reach in the last three months of 2018 was 5.1 million - up on the 4.8 million recorded between July and September. ""It's brilliant that our new and fresh Radio 1 breakfast show is doing so well,"" Bob Shennan, director of BBC Radio and Music, said. However, Radio 1 as a whole went down.

"Teacher training providers have accused the government of ""lowering the bar"" on teacher recruitment to beat England's shortage in the classroom. Teacher trainers have come under pressure from officials to ""justify"" decisions to reject candidates. Emma Hollis, head of the National Association of School-Based Teacher Trainers, said making it easier to get into teaching was not the answer. The government said that recruitment requirements had not changed. It stressed that all those who go on to get qualified teacher status must be judged by the provider to have met all the relevant standards by the end of their course. However, recruitment targets have been missed for six years in a row and hundreds of head teachers say how tough it is to recruit teachers, particularly those in specialist subjects. Ministers have recently made attempts to get more people into teaching, drawing up a new strategy to help with recruitment and retention. They have also increased the number of chances recruits have to pass skills tests, and issued unlimited initial teacher training places in shortage subjects. But providers say they have come under repeated pressure to take the kinds of candidates that they had been rejecting. They have been summoned to a string of meetings by Schools Minister Nick Gibb and his Department for Education (DfE) officials, over the past six months, where they were quizzed over which candidates were rejected and why. Ms Hollis said: ""We are asked to justify why we are rejecting people. What reasons can you give for rejecting those applicants?"" She added: ""There's a pressure on providers to deal with the problem that we are faced with, by accepting a higher proportion of those we interview, even when experience is absolutely telling us that they might not be right. ""Whilst initial teacher training (ITT) providers are acutely aware of the recruitment pressures facing schools, it is right and proper that they must act as gatekeepers to the profession. ""Providers have always looked for potential in applicants to teacher training and have never expected 'oven ready' candidates. ""However, a lowering of the bar is not the solution to the recruitment crisis and our members maintain a sharp focus on quality when selecting candidates,"" she said. She added: ""I actually think a rejection rate is a positive thing and I don't think there would be any employer who would disagree. ""Our bar is high and it should be high for teaching. It needs to be high to ensure the quality of the workforce."" The message was that as long as candidates met the entry requirements - to have GCSE passes in English and maths, and a degree - they should be accepted on to teacher training courses, she said. But there were other skills, she said, such as the ability to make relationships with young people and whether they actually like children, that are just as important. Early last year, Schools Minister Nick Gibb wrote to teacher trainers saying: 'It is right to reject candidates who are not suitable. ""However, it is also crucial to support and develop those who have the desire and talent to teach. ""The emphasis must be on assessing applicants based on their suitability to train to teach, rather than whether they are ready to teach at the point of entry."" Trainers were also concerned about the removal of the trainers' discretion to require trainees to spend some time in school before joining an ITT. This, Ms Hollis said, had led to higher than usual dropout rates. A DfE spokesman said:  ""We want more teachers in our schools, which is why last week we published the first-ever recruitment and retention strategy to make sure that teaching is an attractive profession, so we can train and retain the next generation of inspirational teachers. ""Prior school experience has never been a formal requirement for candidates of initial teacher training. ""ITT providers have discretion over who they recruit, provided the decision is based on readiness to train to teach and their potential to meet the standards by the end of the programme.""

"Animal Farm writer George Orwell died in 1950 It seems even the best of writers get rejected - but not all of them can expect an apology 70 years later. The British Council has apologised to George Orwell after rejecting an essay of his seven decades ago. The author of 1984 and Animal Farm wrote the piece, entitledBritish Cookery,external, in 1946. But the council, which promotes British relations with other countries, told Orwell it would be ""unwise to publish it for the continental reader"". The editor acknowledges it is an ""excellent"" essay, but ""with one or two minor criticisms"" - including that Orwell's recipe for orange marmalade contained ""too much sugar and water"". In the essay, Orwell describes the British diet as ""a simple, rather heavy, perhaps slightly barbarous diet"" and where ""hot drinks are acceptable at most hours of the day"". Alasdair Donaldson, British Council senior policy analyst, said: ""It seems that the organisation in those days was somewhat po-faced and risk-averse, and was anxious to avoid producing an essay about food (even one which mentions the disastrous effects of wartime rationing) in the aftermath of the hungry winter of 1945."" He added: ""Over 70 years later, the British Council is delighted to make amends for its slight on perhaps the UK's greatest political writer of the 20th Century, by re-producing the original essay in full - along with the unfortunate rejection letter."" This time of year is perfect for making marmalade. For just a short few weeks, Seville oranges are in season. The strong bitter fruits are a far cry from the sweet oranges we're used to, and are the secret behind marmalade's distinctive tang. Here isOrwell's take,externalon a classic - but beware, according to his editor's tastes, it's a ""bad recipe!"". Ingredients: 2 seville oranges 2 sweet oranges 2 lemons 8lbs (3.6kg) of preserving sugar 8 pints (4.5 litres) of water Method.Wash and dry the fruit. Halve them and squeeze out the juice. Remove some of the pith, then shred the fruit finely. Tie the pips in a muslin bag. Put the strained juice, rind and pips into the water and soak for 48 hours. Place in a large pan and simmer for an hour and a half until the rind is tender. Leave to stand overnight, then add the sugar and let it dissolve before bringing to the boil. Boil rapidly until a little of the mixture will set into a jelly when placed on a cold plate. Pour into jars which have been heated beforehand and cover with paper covers. According to Orwell's essay, breakfast for most people in Britain is ""not a snack but a serious meal"" that consists of three courses. At the end of the meal comes bread, or toast, with orange marmalade. ""Other kinds of jam are seldom eaten at breakfast, and marmalade does not often appear at other times of the day,"" he writes. Tea is the preferred drink with which to wash breakfast down, since ""coffee in Britain is almost always nasty"". Of tea, British people ""are extremely critical, and everyone has his favourite brand and his pet theory as to how it should be made"". ""The British are great eaters of pickles,"" but ""as for vegetables, it must be admitted they seldom get the treatment they deserve"", he writes. ""Cabbage is simply boiled - a method which renders it almost uneatable - while cauliflowers, leeks and marrows are usually smothered in a tasteless white sauce."" Orwell's BBC resignation letter The writer says high tea in 1940s Britain consisted of a variety of savoury and sweet dishes, but ""no tea would be considered a good one if it did not include at least one kind of cake"". ""A particularly delicious kind of tea cake, made to be toasted and buttered, is the crumpet, which is unsweetened and is eaten with salt,"" he continues. ""Crumpets, which are of very strange appearance - they are white, and full of holes like a Gruyere cheese - are made by a process that is known to very few people.""

"The UK's lowest-paid workers will get a pay rise of more than Â£2,600 per year under a Labour government, Jeremy Corbyn will say. During a visit to Worcester, the Labour leader will set out policies including a pledge to raise the National Living Wage to Â£10 an hour in 2020. He will also accuse the government of creating a ""perfect storm of low pay, insecurity and working poverty"". The Conservatives said there had been a Â£2,750 wage rise under its government. The National Living Wage is the legally binding hourly rate for workers aged 25 and over. It was set at Â£7.83 an hour in April 2018 and is reviewed every year, like the National Minimum Wage (for under 25s). It will rise to Â£8.21 from April. Mr Corbyn will also say his party wants to stop the roll out of Universal Credit and ban zero-hours contacts. Labour says Commons analysis shows its pay pledge would give a rise of Â£2,640. Minimum wage rises 'hit profits, not jobs' 'Real living wage' rises to Â£9 an hour During his visit to Worcester Housing and Benefit Advice Centre later, Mr Corbyn will say: ""With real wages lower than they were 10 years ago, deep cuts to social security, rising borrowing just to make ends meet and the growth of insecure work, the Conservatives have created a perfect storm of low pay, insecurity and working poverty. ""This rising insecurity, with so many without savings to fall back on, is causing terrible stress for millions of families across the country. ""These scandalous levels of in-work poverty are unacceptable and must be brought to an end. ""Every job should provide dignity and security."" Research by Labour shows the number of adults living in families where one or more person is working, and who do not have any savings, has risen to 12.8m. The party says this was an increase of 2.5 million since 2010. Labour's 2017 manifesto promised to raise the minimum wage to Â£10 an hour by 2020. But a Conservative spokesman said Mr Corbyn's numbers ""don't add up"". ""It's because of our National Living Wage that millions of hard working British people have seen a pay rise increasing their wage by Â£2,750, with the lowest paid seeing the biggest pay rise whilst over three million people have been helped into work,"" he said. ""At the same time we've cut taxes for 32 million people, taking the lowest paid out of paying income tax altogether, and taken action to reduce the cost of living.""

"A decision is due on budget cuts that could prevent Ramsgate reopening as a ferry port to ease pressure on other routes in the case of a no-deal Brexit. The governmenthanded Seaborne Freight a Â£13.8m contractto run a service to Ostend, in Belgium, under contingency plans to alleviate any delays at Dover. But the local council is considering cuts to port spending that would make roll-on, roll-off services impossible. Thanet councillors in Kent will vote on the proposed Â£630,000 cuts later. The council has been pumping money into the port to keep it in a state of readiness for ferry operations. BBC business correspondent Jonty Bloom said Thanet Council appeared to be ""caught in a bind"". ""It can't afford to spend this money on the port's facilities if no ferries use them, but the ferries will only run if there is a hard Brexit, something the government is committed to avoiding,"" he said. The Department for Transport (DfT) said it was continuing to talk to the council about plans to re-establish ferry services. Officials believe extra ferries from Ramsgate would relieve pressure on the Port of Dover in the event a no-deal Brexit leads to an increase in border checks on goods and passengers. They also hope the service would divert traffic away from the M20, which may have to be used as an emergency lorry park if backlogs develop at the border. But the contract with Seaborne to run the service is controversial because it has no ships and has never run a ferry service before. No-deal Brexit ferry contract queried Brexit ferry firm in terms gaffe Ferry firm 'ready' for no-deal Brexit And last month it was discovered that the terms and conditions on its website seemed to have been copied from a takeaway restaurant. The mayor of Ostend has also said it would be impossible to have a new service up and running by the end of March, although it is believed Seaborne has paid to have Ramsgate harbour dredged so that it can take larger ships. Thanet Council said it had to find large savings to meet its medium-term financial strategy and balance its budget. It added that if a new deal to provide a Ramsgate to Ostend service was not signed, the proposed cuts would be voted on later. By BBC business correspondent Jonty Bloom Considering the criticism of the deal with Seaborne Freight already, cuts by the council which make it impossible to run the service at all are likely to be very embarrassing for the government. The DfT said it was a recommendation that had been put forward for a decision by councillors as elected members. It added that it continued to have conversations with a number of stakeholders including Thanet Council over any plans to re-establish ferry services at the Port of Ramsgate. Ramsgate last ran a regular ferry service to and from the Continent in 2013. Its harbour can take three roll-on roll-off ferries at a time and it has been keen to restart operations. At the moment the port is mainly being used to support off-shore wind turbines and import cars, but reopening Ramsgate as a major ferry port has been controversial with many residents saying they are concerned about the increase in traffic that it would involve.

The brand said it would turn the incident ""into a powerful learning moment for the Gucci team"" and was committed to increasing diversity.

Dolce & Gabbanacancelled its Shanghai fashion show amid accusations of racism. The brand posted videos of a Chinese model eating Italian foods like pizza and pasta with chopsticks. Widely seen as offensive, the campaign led to a severe backlash in China with several retailers pulling the brand's products.

"This video can not be played Theresa May: ""I am clear that I am going to deliver Brexit, deliver it on time."" Theresa May has told EU leaders she can get the Brexit deal through Parliament if they give her legally-binding changes to it. The UK prime minister - who also vowed to deliver Brexit ""on time"" - was speaking after a series of meetings with top EU officials in Brussels. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker again ruled out the kind of changes Mrs May wants to see. But the two sides agreed to further talks to break the deadlock. Mrs May said she had also spoken to European Council President Donald Tusk about hiscomments on Wednesday about there being a ""special place in hell""for those who campaigned for Brexit without a plan to deliver it safely. Laura Kuenssberg: More talks pledge helps May in perception war EU's Verhofstadt welcomes Corbyn's offer What's behind Corbyn's Brexit letter to May? Brexit: All you need to know She said Mr Tusk's language ""was not helpful"" and had ""caused widespread dismay in the United Kingdom"". Mrs May said she had told him he should be ""focusing"" on working with the UK to get a Brexit deal. Mr Tusk tweeted that there was ""no breakthrough in sight"" following his talks with the UK prime minister. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mrs May said she had ""set out very clearly the position from Parliament that we must have legally binding changes to the withdrawal agreement in order to deal with Parliament's concerns over the backstop"". That, ""together with the other work that we're doing on workers' rights and other issues, will deliver a stable majority in Parliament,"" she said. Mr Juncker ""underlined that the EU27 will not reopen the withdrawal agreement"" in their talks, according to a joint statement released by the two sides. But he ""expressed his openness"" to adding words to the non-binding future relationship document - that also has to be backed by MPs - to be ""more ambitious in terms of content and speed"". Did anything change? Not that much. But for Downing Street, this has not been a pointless stop-off in the almost never-ending Brexit adventure. Because, while there hasn't been a breakthrough, the EU has agreed to more talks, which at least opens up the possibility of discussing the changes to the troubled backstop that has caused such political difficulty. It might not sound like much, but ""we can talk"", is at least a different message to ""this is over"" . Read more from Laura Meanwhile, Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay and EU negotiator Michel Barnier will hold talks in Strasbourg on Monday, as the EU and UK Brexit negotiating teams discuss proposed changes to the deal. Downing Street said these talks would cover ""alternative arrangements"" for the Irish border, as called for by MPs in a vote last week. A spokeswoman said other UK ministers, such as Attorney General Geoffrey Cox could be involved. Mr Cox is ""working on working on possible ways in which legal texts could be drafted, that gave effect to the objective we want,"" Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington told the BBC. Mrs May and Mr Juncker will meet again before the end of February, to review progress. The prime minister is expected to put the deal to a vote in the Commons towards the end of February. Jeremy Corbyn has listed five demands, including a UK-wide customs union Jeremy Corbyn has written to the prime minister setting out his party's price for supporting a Brexit deal and to offer talks to secure ""a sensible agreement that can win the support of Parliament and bring the country together"". The Labour leader's five demands include a ""permanent and comprehensive UK-wide customs union"" aligned with the EU's customs rules but with an agreement ""that includes a UK say on future EU trade deals"". Mr Corbyn also wants close alignment with the EU single market and ""dynamic alignment on rights and protections"" for workers so that UK standards do not fall behind those of the EU. He also proposes participation in EU agencies and funding programmes, and agreements on security and keeping access to the European Arrest Warrant. The letter does not mention previous demands that any deal must deliver the ""exact same benefits"" that membership of the single market and customs union currently does - effectively scrapping the party's ""six tests"" that had been its Brexit policy. The BBC's Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg said Labour's shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer would be meeting Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington to discuss the proposals. Owen Smith says he and others are thinking of quitting Labour But the move was met with dismay by Labour members of the People's Vote campaign for another EU referendum, who accused Mr Corbyn of going back on his commitment, made at the party's conference, to back a public vote if he can't force a general election. Labour MP Owen Smith, who made a failed leadership bid in 2016, has told the BBC he and others were thinking of quitting the party over Mr Corbyn's Brexit stance. But Labour's Stephen Kinnock, who backs the ""Norway Plus"" model of a close economic partnership with the EU, welcomed Mr Corbyn's letter, tweeting: ""This can break the deadlock."" Mr Lidington said he and Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay would be willing to discuss Labour's proposals with Sir Keir and other frontbenchers. But he said Labour's call to have a say in trade deals while being in a customs union with the EU was ""wishful thinking"", because Brussels had ruled it out. The European Parliament's Brexit co-ordinator Guy Verhofstadt welcomed Mr Corbyn's proposals, saying ""the broadest possible majority"" was needed for a Brexit deal in the UK and ""cross-party co-operation is the way forward"". It was also backed by Conservative MP Sir Oliver Letwin, who wants to see the UK in a Norway-style relationship with the EU after Brexit. Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played Equine flu: Inside the Newmarket laboratory that detected the outbreak An outbreak of equine flu has led to British horse racing meetings being cancelled and fears over the impact on next month's Cheltenham Festival. All four fixtures on Thursday were called off by the British Horseracing Authority (BHA) after three vaccinated horses tested positive for the disease. Trainer Donald McCain has confirmed the horses came from his Cheshire stables. Horses from the infected yard raced on Wednesday, potentially exposing a significant number of horses. British-trained runners have been barred from running in Ireland. Jump racing's showpiece four-day Cheltenham Festival is due to start in 33 days, on 12 March. And while it is not known what the precise impact might be, the situation has echoes of the foot-and-mouth crisis 18 years ago, which began at a similar time of year and eventually led to the meeting being called off. Announced late on Wednesday that Thursday's racing at Huntingdon, in Cambridgeshire; Doncaster (South Yorkshire), Chelmsford (Essex) and Welsh track Ffos Las was cancelled. A decision on whether Friday and Saturday's fixtures - at Newcastle and Southwell - can go ahead is not expected until Thursday evening. Wolverhampton Racecourse has said its meeting on Saturday will not take place as a horse from the infected yard ran there this week and a deep clean has been ordered. Racing is not permitted for four days afterwards. Three horses vaccinated against the virus tested positive on Wednesday night at the Cheshire stables of Donald McCain, the son of the late Ginger McCain - who trained the legendary Red Rum to win the Grand National a record three times in the 1970s. The alarm was raised as horses from his yard had raced on Wednesday at Ayr, Ludlow and Wolverhampton. Brant Dunshea, chief regulatory officer at the BHA, said there ""is a potential risk"" that racing could be suspended for days or even weeks but added that a decision would not be made without ""thinking through all the consequences"". Leading Irish trainer Gordon Elliott, who had five runners at Ayr has isolated his horses in a facility 15 miles from his main operation. In a statement issued through the National Trainers Federation, McCain said: ""I have been aware of the recent news about equine influenza outbreaks in France and Ireland, and over the last couple of days, I have been concerned about the health status of a small number of horses in the yard. ""Their welfare is at the front of our minds, so at my request, our veterinary surgeon has examined them regularly and we have followed his advice on testing and treatment. ""It was by following this protocol that the positive results for equine flu came to light yesterday evening. ""The BHA were contacted immediately and we are liaising closely with them about bio-security and management of all the horses at Bankhouse. Bankhouse follows all the available advice on disease control and all our horses are fully inoculated."" He added: ""We are scrupulous about observing the health status of horses in our care and taking the necessary steps to treat any condition that may affect them. It follows we would never race any horses that we could have known were infected. There are no known consequences for humans exposed to equine flu ""Over the last two months, all potential runners have been scoped and their blood checked within 36 hours of their races to ensure that only healthy horses compete for the yard. ""When new horses arrive at our yard we, as much as possible, try to keep them separate but at this stage cannot know if the infection came from recent arrivals or from horses returning from racing. ""We have three confirmed cases and this morning have taken blood and swabs from all the others for testing."" David Sykes, director of equine health and welfare at the BHA, added: ""We would like to thank Donald McCain for his co-operation in this matter, and for the responsible manner in which he has dealt with this issue, under the guidance of his veterinary surgeon. ""He has acted professionally with the interests of the racing industry and the health of his horses as his priority."" Irish racing continues but without British runners Horses that have contracted equine flu can develop a high fever, coughing, nasal discharge and sometimes swelling of the lymph nodes. The incubation period is usually days but recovery can take weeks, or even months. There are no known consequences for humans exposed to the disease. The BHA said there was ""significant concern over welfare and the potential spread of the disease"" and it was attempting to prevent further cases. It said ""quarantine and biosecurity measures"" are being put in place and horse movements restricted. ""The full extent of potential exposure is unknown and we are working quickly to understand as much as we can to assist our decision making,"" it added. Since the start of 2019, there have been seven outbreaks of equine flu - in Essex, Cheshire, Derbyshire, Lincolnshire, Yorkshire and Suffolk. The two cases in Suffolk involved thoroughbreds - one centred on eight vaccinated two-year-old horses and the other was six unvaccinated animals. This news has rocked horse racing at a time when anticipation is building before the Cheltenham Festival, and the bloodstock industry prepares for the start of the breeding season. ""As you can imagine, a normal race meeting will have circa 70-100 racehorses stabled in a close proximity from all parts of the country, all housed together for a day and then they all go back home to their own yard, so it could be catastrophic,"" trainer Seamus Mullins told BBC Radio 5 live. It is unclear at this stage the potential effect on future fixtures  with the 'Super Saturday' meeting at Newbury in Berkshire on 9 February - where last year's Gold Cup winner Native River is due to run - the next high-profile fixture. With just over four weeks left to the Festival, the countdown is on for jockeys, trainers, owners and punters, with many leading contenders earmarked for prep races over the next 10 days. ""If it was a long-term stoppage it would hit racing very, very hard both with the day-to-day training of the horses, but more importantly it would financially hit the industry very, very hard,"" said Mullins. ""Every day without racing is a loss on income for everybody, from the stable lads in the yard, to the jockeys, trainers, owners, bookmakers, racecourses, it would be very, very serious."" Equine influenza is a highly infectious disease that affects horses, mules and donkeys, occurring globally caused by strains of the Influenza A virus. It is the most potentially damaging of the respiratory viruses that occur in UK horses and disease symptoms in non-immune animals include high fever, coughing and nasal discharge. The outbreak at the infected yard follows the identification of a number of equine influenza cases across Europe and the UK, including several in vaccinated horses. Following the recent outbreaks, guidance was sent to racehorse trainers to inform them that all horses that have not had a vaccination against equine flu within the last six months should receive a booster vaccination, and that trainers should be extra-vigilant. However, equine influenza can be highly contagious and - unlike other infectious diseases - can be airborne over reasonable distances as well as be transmitted indirectly, including via people. ""It's very similar to human flu; the symptoms are the same and the horses feel the same,"" said Mullins. ""You get a high temperature, a nasal discharge and eventually you get coughing and the horses feel rough. It's similar to humans - but they get over it."" Cornelius Lysaght, horse racing correspondent There is such a feeling of deja vu here, 18 years almost to the day since I recall being at Wincanton races when news first emerged of the outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the UK in 2001. Racing was stopped for a while, and eventually the Cheltenham Festival was called off altogether. There's no suggestion that this incident will cause the same kind of disruption, but that said there's big element of uncertainty about what happens next, and any further shut-down - Cheltenham is again looming - would clearly have a considerable effect on the sport but on all the ancillary industries that go with it.

"A decision is due on budget cuts that could prevent Ramsgate reopening as a ferry port to ease pressure on other routes in the case of a no-deal Brexit. The governmenthanded Seaborne Freight a Â£13.8m contractto run a service to Ostend, in Belgium, under contingency plans to alleviate any delays at Dover. But the local council is considering cuts to port spending that would make roll-on, roll-off services impossible. Thanet councillors in Kent will vote on the proposed Â£630,000 cuts later. The council has been pumping money into the port to keep it in a state of readiness for ferry operations. BBC business correspondent Jonty Bloom said Thanet Council appeared to be ""caught in a bind"". ""It can't afford to spend this money on the port's facilities if no ferries use them, but the ferries will only run if there is a hard Brexit, something the government is committed to avoiding,"" he said. The Department for Transport (DfT) said it was continuing to talk to the council about plans to re-establish ferry services. Officials believe extra ferries from Ramsgate would relieve pressure on the Port of Dover in the event a no-deal Brexit leads to an increase in border checks on goods and passengers. They also hope the service would divert traffic away from the M20, which may have to be used as an emergency lorry park if backlogs develop at the border. But the contract with Seaborne to run the service is controversial because it has no ships and has never run a ferry service before. No-deal Brexit ferry contract queried Brexit ferry firm in terms gaffe Ferry firm 'ready' for no-deal Brexit And last month it was discovered that the terms and conditions on its website seemed to have been copied from a takeaway restaurant. The mayor of Ostend has also said it would be impossible to have a new service up and running by the end of March, although it is believed Seaborne has paid to have Ramsgate harbour dredged so that it can take larger ships. Thanet Council said it had to find large savings to meet its medium-term financial strategy and balance its budget. It added that if a new deal to provide a Ramsgate to Ostend service was not signed, the proposed cuts would be voted on later. By BBC business correspondent Jonty Bloom Considering the criticism of the deal with Seaborne Freight already, cuts by the council which make it impossible to run the service at all are likely to be very embarrassing for the government. The DfT said it was a recommendation that had been put forward for a decision by councillors as elected members. It added that it continued to have conversations with a number of stakeholders including Thanet Council over any plans to re-establish ferry services at the Port of Ramsgate. Ramsgate last ran a regular ferry service to and from the Continent in 2013. Its harbour can take three roll-on roll-off ferries at a time and it has been keen to restart operations. At the moment the port is mainly being used to support off-shore wind turbines and import cars, but reopening Ramsgate as a major ferry port has been controversial with many residents saying they are concerned about the increase in traffic that it would involve.

"Dunfermline Crematorium and Kirkcaldy Crematorium are operated by Fife Council Families affected by the baby ashes scandal at council-run crematoria in Fife are to receive compensation payments of up to Â£4,000. The payments will be made after parents were wrongly told their babies were too small for their ashes to be recovered. In fact, staff at crematoria in Dunfermline and Kirkcaldy disposed of the children's ashes anonymously, sometimes in the waste. Fife Council said it apologised unreservedly to the families. Campaigners estimate that more than 450 families across Scotland were affected by the baby ashes scandal. Why were bereaved parents denied baby ashes? Mother's baby ashes scandal memorial call Inquiries into the scandal led to apologies andchanges in the law,external. Councils includingEdinburgh,AberdeenandGlasgowhave already agreed compensation, now Fife council has followed suit with a similar scheme. Thompsons Solicitors, who represent eight of the families involved, said the agreement was ""of huge significance to the parents affected"". Solicitor Catherine McGarrell added: ""It has been a long, emotional journey for the parents but this does provide some small comfort."" She also welcomed moves by the council to engage with families over a permanent memorial to the children. Ms McGarrell added: ""The agreement of Fife Council to this compensation scheme is of huge significance to the parents affected. ""The amounts of money involved are of a far lesser importance than the sign of good faith shown by the local authority. ""The council have backed up their public apology with real action which is welcomed by my clients. "" A memorial to the families affected by the Mortonhall baby ashes scandal wasunveiled on Saturday in Edinburgh. Alan Paul, a senior manager with Fife Council, said: ""We have apologised unreservedly to families who were affected by our past practices and recognise the harm and distress that it caused."" ""As documented, some infants' ashes were unrecovered from the chamber and we have changed our practices to avoid this happening again. ""We previously invited families to discuss a specific memorial to their infants and have just this week received some ideas from their representatives, which we will be discussing in due course."" Families affected can come forward for compensation until the scheme closes on 1 March. December 2012:Charity reveals ashes of hundreds of stillborn babies had been buried without parents' knowledge at Mortonhall in Edinburgh for more than 40 years. April 2013:A BBC Scotland investigation revealed that Aberdeen's Hazlehead Crematorium did not return ashes for babies up to 18 months old. A week later BBC Scotland reported at least two babies' ashes were disposed of secretly in Glasgow. An audit was later published covering cases at Linn and Daldowie crematoriums and the council apologised. An Infant Cremation Commission is established.

"Greg James made his breakfast show debut in August last year More than 230,000 extra listeners have been tuning in to the Radio 1 breakfast show since Greg James took over from Nick Grimshaw in August. According to industry body Rajar, his reach in the last three months of 2018 was 5.1 million - up on the 4.8 million recorded between July and September. ""It's brilliant that our new and fresh Radio 1 breakfast show is doing so well,"" Bob Shennan, director of BBC Radio and Music, said. However, Radio 1 as a whole went down.

Yet his overall audience was still down on the equivalent period in 2017. Rajar puts his audience between October and December 2018 as 9.06 million - an increase on the 8.8 million between July and September. Zoe Ball took over the Radio 2 breakfast show following Evans's departure But he had been up as high as 9.43 million at the end of of 2017.

"Mobile phones should be banned from the dinner table and bedtimes as part of a healthy approach to devices, the UK's four chief medical officers have said. Children should also take a break from screen-based activities every two hours, the government advisers said. And they added industry must do more to keep children safe. Their guidance,externalcomes as English Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, is set to meet bosses at Instagram over the handling of self-harm and suicide content. Links have been made between the suicide of teenager Molly Russell and her exposure to harmful material on Instagram. Her father has said he believes the Facebook-owned platform""helped kill my daughter"". Tips on how to limit excessive screen time UK 'could ban' social media over suicide images After Molly Russell took her own life, her family discovered distressing material about suicide on her Instagram account Prof Dame Sally Davies, England's chief medical officer and the lead for the UK, said the case was ""tragic"" and it was clear some children were being exposed to inappropriate content. She told the BBC companies had a duty of care to help keep children safe and that age limits for using social media needed to be properly enforced and children should not be channelled towards harmful content - one of the key concerns in the Molly Russell case. But Dame Sally said a review of evidence had not proven a clear link between screen-based activities and mental health problems. And digital technologies could be a force for good, aiding online learning, socialising and helping people manage health conditions. There are several clear steps for parents, which the chief medical officers say will help keep children safe and healthy. These include: not using phones and mobile devices at the dinner table - talking as a family is very important for development keeping screens out of the bedroom at bedtime talking as a family about keeping safe online and about cyber-bulling and what children should do if they are worried not using phones when crossing a road or doing any other activity that requires a person's full attention making sure children take a break from screens every two hours by getting up and being active policing their own use too - parents should give their children proper attention and quality family time and never assume they are happy for pictures to be shared Dame Sally said a code of conduct was definitely needed. She wants to see technology companies invest in systems that properly vet the ages of users - a number of platforms require users to be 13 but these were not properly policed, she said. The guidance is also critical of what it calls ""persuasive design"". This refers to techniques used to encourage addictive behaviour, including collecting likes and rewards for performing actions such as sharing pictures. This video can not be played The design tricks that get you hooked on your phone Dame Sally also wants social media companies to develop better algorithms that push positive content to users. This has already been done for users who search for content that could potentially radicalise them. Instead of being fed material that promotes terrorism, users get content that aims to de-radicalise. Dame Sally said the same thing could happen when people searched for ""self-harm"" or ""suicide"". ""We would like to see content that promotes help-lines and where to go for support,"" she said. And she warned if industry did not act, ministers were likely to legislate to compel them. ""They need to sort themselves out - to safeguard our children,"" Dame Sally said. ""They have a duty of care - and if they don't, I expect the government will tell them how they will sort it."" Facebook welcomed the guidance and said it wanted young people to be safe online. It said it had introduced a new tool to help people see how much time they were spending on Facebook and Instagram, with daily reminders and a way to limit notifications. Twitter said it had introduced 70 changes in 2018 ""to make the service healthier and safer"". The chief medical officer used a team of academics to scour the research done on this issue. The academics said that, while some research had pointed to an association between screen-based activities and negative effects such as an increased risk of anxiety and depression, it was still inconclusive. It could be just that people who struggled with mental health problems were more likely to turn to their devices, Dame Sally said, rather than their habits being the root cause of the problems. Nonetheless, Dame Sally said, there needed to be a precautionary approach to this - until more research had been done - hence the guidance to parents. Dr Bernadka Dubicka, of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said the medical officers were right to be cautious. ""We do not yet have enough evidence to draw a definite link between screen time and mental health problems - but it is clear that some of the content that young people are viewing online, such as pro-anorexia, suicide and self-harming content, can be incredibly harmful,"" she said. The chief medical officers' guidance comes after leading paediatricians said last month thatparents should worry less about screen useafter a review found there was little evidence it was harmful in itself.

"This video can not be played Donald Tusk: ""Special place in hell"" for those without Brexit plan They weren't off-the-cuff remarks, but a planned outburst. The softly-spoken politician who holds the authority of all EU countries has just completely condemned a chunk of the British cabinet, wondering aloud: ""What that special place in hell looks like for those who promoted Brexit, without even a sketch of a plan how to carry it out safely"". Sure, for a long time the EU has been frustrated with how the UK has approached all of this. And sure, plenty of voters in the UK are annoyed too at how politicians have been handling these negotiations. But it is quite something for Donald Tusk to have gone in like this, studs up, even though he sometimes reminisces about his time as a football hooligan in his youth. Be clear, he was not intending to talk about voters who wanted to Leave, but politicians who were involved in the campaign. Tusk: Place in hell for no-plan Brexiteers PM in Belfast for Brexit deadlock talks New ideas for the Brexit border backstop Brexit: All you need to know He also had pretty stern remarks for those who'd been on the other side of the argument, accusing those who still want the UK to stay in the EU of having ""no political force, and no effective leadership"". Mr Tusk will be all too aware that he will provoke tempers at home, even laughing about it as he left the stage with the Taoiseach, the Irish leader, Leo Varadkar. But if you strip away the planned flash of temper, also in his remarks was an invitation to the prime minister to come forward with a different version of the backstop - a ""believable guarantee"", a promise that a ""common solution is possible"". That is, on the face of it, in tone at least, more of an opening to the UK to put something new on the table than we have seen from the EU side. Certainly, Theresa May's most pressing job is to put something that could work on the table in Belfast, and in Brussels, and to do it fast. But don't forget, also at her back, she has Brexiteers whom she needs to manage, whose expectations she needs to contain, whose votes she desperately needs.

"The number of anti-Semitic hate incidents in the UK rose by 16% in 2018, according to figures from Jewish charity the Community Security Trust. CST said it recorded 1,652 anti-Semitic incidents last year, the highest total since it began collecting data in 1984. The charity added the figures reflected ""deepening divides in our country and our politics"". Home Secretary Sajid Javid said the government was doing all it could to ""rid society of these poisonous views"". He added anti-Semitism was ""utterly despicable"" and had ""no place in society"". These new figures are broadly in line with aHome Office report from October,external, which showed all forms of hate crime in England and Wales rose by 17% in 2017/18. Reality Check: Is anti-Semitism on the rise? Wales tops anti-Semitic Google searches LeBron apologises for 'Jewish money' post Of the 1,652 incidents recorded by the CST in 2018, 123 involved ""potential grievous bodily harm or a threat to life"", a 17% decrease from 2017. The most common single type of incident involved verbal abuse randomly directed at Jewish people in public. The report cited a number of cases across different categories, including a man who was walking to a synagogue when food was thrown at him from a car, a woman who was spat at in the face on a bus, a Jewish bakery that was vandalised with anti-Semitic graffiti, and a brick that was thrown at a synagogue's glass front door. The CST report also said: There were 384 anti-Semitic incidents involving social media last year - nearly a quarter (23%) of the overall total number of reports A total of 148 incidents in 2018 were examples of - or related to arguments over - alleged anti-Semitism in the Labour Party Almost 75% of all anti-Semitic incidents took place in London and Manchester - where the two largest Jewish communities in the UK are located At least 100 incidents were recorded in every month of the year, with the highest monthly totals coming in May (182), April (151) and August (150) Responding to the report, the chairman of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Anti-Semitism, Labour MP John Mann, said: ""Sadly, these figures are not surprising, indeed they are predictable. ""If you consider the whole anti-Semitic onslaught on social media as just one incident then, in fact, the problem is bigger than the incident figures suggest."" Marie van der Zyl, president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, said the CST figures were ""very worrying for Jews living in the UK"".

"Pilot Andrew Hill, 54, denies 11 counts of manslaughter by gross negligence Cockpit footage from the jet involved in the Shoreham air crash showed there was ""no sign"" the pilot may have blacked out, a court has heard. Aviation expert and prosecution witness Jonathan Whaley told the Old Bailey it appeared all the movements made by pilot Andrew Hill were deliberate. ""His movements seem to be positive and for reasons, whatever those reasons are,"" he said. Mr Hill, 54, denies 11 counts of manslaughter by gross negligence. Eleven men were killed when the Hawker Hunter he was flying crashed on to the A27 outside the Shoreham Airshow, in West Sussex, on 22 August 2015 following a loop manoeuvre. Mr Whaley, a display pilot who has flown hundreds of flights in a Hawker Hunter, told the jury the turn performed by Mr Hill as he entered into his final ""bent loop"" was ""relatively smooth, not suddenly yanking G"". Commenting on the entire cockpit footage of the final flight shown to jurors, he said the view from the jet upside down before the final dive would have made him feel ""deeply uncomfortable"". The Hawker Hunter jet prior to plummeting on to the A27 on 22 August 2015 The prosecution argue Mr Hill should have known he did not have the height to dive down safely and should have carried out an escape manoeuvre instead. As the plane descends before the crash, Mr Whaley described it as being in ""deep stall"" with the wings rocking ""when one wing stalls more than the other"". He said due to the massive drag produced by the plane in deep stall no amount of power - even full power - would make any difference. ""You're going down, that's what's going to happen,"" he told the court. Mr Whaley was later asked what the pilot should do if he realised he did not have the required height. ""Stop putting the nose down. Don't commit to the loop,"" he said. ""How deeply ingrained is this?"" he was asked. ""It's fundamental,"" Mr Whaley replied. The trial continues.

"This video can not be played Equine flu: Inside the Newmarket laboratory that detected the outbreak An outbreak of equine flu has led to British horse racing meetings being cancelled and fears over the impact on next month's Cheltenham Festival. All four fixtures on Thursday were called off by the British Horseracing Authority (BHA) after three vaccinated horses tested positive for the disease. Trainer Donald McCain has confirmed the horses came from his Cheshire stables. Horses from the infected yard raced on Wednesday, potentially exposing a significant number of horses. British-trained runners have been barred from running in Ireland. Jump racing's showpiece four-day Cheltenham Festival is due to start in 33 days, on 12 March. And while it is not known what the precise impact might be, the situation has echoes of the foot-and-mouth crisis 18 years ago, which began at a similar time of year and eventually led to the meeting being called off. Announced late on Wednesday that Thursday's racing at Huntingdon, in Cambridgeshire; Doncaster (South Yorkshire), Chelmsford (Essex) and Welsh track Ffos Las was cancelled. A decision on whether Friday and Saturday's fixtures - at Newcastle and Southwell - can go ahead is not expected until Thursday evening. Wolverhampton Racecourse has said its meeting on Saturday will not take place as a horse from the infected yard ran there this week and a deep clean has been ordered. Racing is not permitted for four days afterwards. Three horses vaccinated against the virus tested positive on Wednesday night at the Cheshire stables of Donald McCain, the son of the late Ginger McCain - who trained the legendary Red Rum to win the Grand National a record three times in the 1970s. The alarm was raised as horses from his yard had raced on Wednesday at Ayr, Ludlow and Wolverhampton. Brant Dunshea, chief regulatory officer at the BHA, said there ""is a potential risk"" that racing could be suspended for days or even weeks but added that a decision would not be made without ""thinking through all the consequences"". Leading Irish trainer Gordon Elliott, who had five runners at Ayr has isolated his horses in a facility 15 miles from his main operation. In a statement issued through the National Trainers Federation, McCain said: ""I have been aware of the recent news about equine influenza outbreaks in France and Ireland, and over the last couple of days, I have been concerned about the health status of a small number of horses in the yard. ""Their welfare is at the front of our minds, so at my request, our veterinary surgeon has examined them regularly and we have followed his advice on testing and treatment. ""It was by following this protocol that the positive results for equine flu came to light yesterday evening. ""The BHA were contacted immediately and we are liaising closely with them about bio-security and management of all the horses at Bankhouse. Bankhouse follows all the available advice on disease control and all our horses are fully inoculated."" He added: ""We are scrupulous about observing the health status of horses in our care and taking the necessary steps to treat any condition that may affect them. It follows we would never race any horses that we could have known were infected. There are no known consequences for humans exposed to equine flu ""Over the last two months, all potential runners have been scoped and their blood checked within 36 hours of their races to ensure that only healthy horses compete for the yard. ""When new horses arrive at our yard we, as much as possible, try to keep them separate but at this stage cannot know if the infection came from recent arrivals or from horses returning from racing. ""We have three confirmed cases and this morning have taken blood and swabs from all the others for testing."" David Sykes, director of equine health and welfare at the BHA, added: ""We would like to thank Donald McCain for his co-operation in this matter, and for the responsible manner in which he has dealt with this issue, under the guidance of his veterinary surgeon. ""He has acted professionally with the interests of the racing industry and the health of his horses as his priority."" Irish racing continues but without British runners Horses that have contracted equine flu can develop a high fever, coughing, nasal discharge and sometimes swelling of the lymph nodes. The incubation period is usually days but recovery can take weeks, or even months. There are no known consequences for humans exposed to the disease. The BHA said there was ""significant concern over welfare and the potential spread of the disease"" and it was attempting to prevent further cases. It said ""quarantine and biosecurity measures"" are being put in place and horse movements restricted. ""The full extent of potential exposure is unknown and we are working quickly to understand as much as we can to assist our decision making,"" it added. Since the start of 2019, there have been seven outbreaks of equine flu - in Essex, Cheshire, Derbyshire, Lincolnshire, Yorkshire and Suffolk. The two cases in Suffolk involved thoroughbreds - one centred on eight vaccinated two-year-old horses and the other was six unvaccinated animals. This news has rocked horse racing at a time when anticipation is building before the Cheltenham Festival, and the bloodstock industry prepares for the start of the breeding season. ""As you can imagine, a normal race meeting will have circa 70-100 racehorses stabled in a close proximity from all parts of the country, all housed together for a day and then they all go back home to their own yard, so it could be catastrophic,"" trainer Seamus Mullins told BBC Radio 5 live. It is unclear at this stage the potential effect on future fixtures  with the 'Super Saturday' meeting at Newbury in Berkshire on 9 February - where last year's Gold Cup winner Native River is due to run - the next high-profile fixture. With just over four weeks left to the Festival, the countdown is on for jockeys, trainers, owners and punters, with many leading contenders earmarked for prep races over the next 10 days. ""If it was a long-term stoppage it would hit racing very, very hard both with the day-to-day training of the horses, but more importantly it would financially hit the industry very, very hard,"" said Mullins. ""Every day without racing is a loss on income for everybody, from the stable lads in the yard, to the jockeys, trainers, owners, bookmakers, racecourses, it would be very, very serious."" Equine influenza is a highly infectious disease that affects horses, mules and donkeys, occurring globally caused by strains of the Influenza A virus. It is the most potentially damaging of the respiratory viruses that occur in UK horses and disease symptoms in non-immune animals include high fever, coughing and nasal discharge. The outbreak at the infected yard follows the identification of a number of equine influenza cases across Europe and the UK, including several in vaccinated horses. Following the recent outbreaks, guidance was sent to racehorse trainers to inform them that all horses that have not had a vaccination against equine flu within the last six months should receive a booster vaccination, and that trainers should be extra-vigilant. However, equine influenza can be highly contagious and - unlike other infectious diseases - can be airborne over reasonable distances as well as be transmitted indirectly, including via people. ""It's very similar to human flu; the symptoms are the same and the horses feel the same,"" said Mullins. ""You get a high temperature, a nasal discharge and eventually you get coughing and the horses feel rough. It's similar to humans - but they get over it."" Cornelius Lysaght, horse racing correspondent There is such a feeling of deja vu here, 18 years almost to the day since I recall being at Wincanton races when news first emerged of the outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the UK in 2001. Racing was stopped for a while, and eventually the Cheltenham Festival was called off altogether. There's no suggestion that this incident will cause the same kind of disruption, but that said there's big element of uncertainty about what happens next, and any further shut-down - Cheltenham is again looming - would clearly have a considerable effect on the sport but on all the ancillary industries that go with it.

"Harris was seen waving to children as they were waiting in the school hall for their lunch The Ministry of Justice has launched an investigation after convicted paedophile Rolf Harris entered the grounds of a Berkshire primary school. The school's head teacher confronted the former TV star, who was in conversation with a local sculptor, and asked him to leave the site. The MoJ said it was ""looking into these reports and will take appropriate action"". Harris was jailed for five years in 2014 but released on licence in 2017. A spokeswoman for the MoJ added: ""When sex offenders are released they are subject to strict licence conditions and are liable to be returned to custody for breaching them."" Head teacher Richard Jarrett said: ""In line with our standard procedures, an uninvited individual was asked to leave the outer perimeter of the school site yesterday, which he did without delay. ""At no time did any of our pupils come into contact with the individual nor was the individual invited by us onto the school grounds."" Harris was seen waving to children as they were waiting in the school hall for their lunch on Tuesday. He was talking to sculptor Nick Garnett, who was working in the school's ""Kiss and Drop"" area. Harris was seen waving to children as they were waiting for their lunch Mr Garnett told the BBC: ""I turned round and there was Rolf Harris, which was a strange moment. ""He asked for a piece of timber. Apparently he's interested in making some carvings, so I gave him a couple of pieces."" He said: ""At no point was he near any children. The headmaster dealt with it incredibly calmly."" Speaking to the Press Association, the parent of a pupil at the school said: ""What was he doing there? ""I feel like it was a really bad judgement call and I don't think his excuse is effective enough."" Thames Valley Police said: ""A report was made that a man was on the site of the school. ""An officer attended the scene but no offence was committed. No arrests were made and advice has been given to the man involved."" Australian-born TV presenter Harris was jailed in 2014 for 12 indecent assaults, relating to four girls between 1968 and 1986. In May 2017 he was cleared of four unconnected historical sex offences, which he had denied. In November 2017 one of the 12 indecent assault convictions was overturned by the Court of Appeal.
