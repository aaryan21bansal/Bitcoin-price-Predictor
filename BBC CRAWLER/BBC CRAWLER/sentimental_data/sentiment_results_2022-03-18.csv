"Coventry is the current UK City of Culture Bradford, County Durham, Southampton and Wrexham have made the shortlist to be named UK City of Culture for 2025. A different location is given the title every four years. The winning place will be announced in May and will be the fourth holder, after Derry-Londonderry, Hull and the current City of Culture, Coventry. The title has brought Â£172m to Coventry, according to the government, as well as events like BBC Radio 1's Big Weekend and the Turner Prize. ""We have seen a huge positive impact in this year's host city, Coventry, with millions of pounds in investment and thousands of visitors,"" said Arts Minister Lord Parkinson of Whitley Bay. The government said the finalists would have to show how they would use culture ""to transform a place through social, cultural and economic regeneration"" and recover from the Covid pandemic. For the first time, groups of towns, areas and counties have been able to bid, as well as single urban areas. The four locations that missed out on progressing from the longlist were Cornwall, Derby, Stirling and a bid covering Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon. The city with the youngest population in the UK, Bradford says winning would ""leave a lasting legacy of increased visitor numbers and a more vibrant, sustainable cultural sector"". It would also increase opportunities for local people and ""bring greater community engagement across the district and celebrate our diverse communities"", the bid says. Bradford 2025 organisers have already backed a string of events in West Yorkshire that they say give a glimpse of what to expect, such as a new public artwork programme, a light festival visited by more than 20,000 people in November, and mentoring network FilmMakers 2025. Claims to fame: David Hockney, Bad Boy Chiller Crew, National Science and Media Museum. County Durham includes the towns of Bishop Auckland and Barnard Castle as well as Durham. It says being UK City of Culture would attract 15 million visitors, spending Â£700m and creating 2,500 jobs in the creative industries and 1,800 in tourism. It would also ""empower residents and help to improve community well-being"" and ""strengthen our reputation nationally and internationally as a place to live, work, visit and invest"", organisers promise. The year would include spectacular opening and closing events, the bicentenary of the world's first public steam railway, a travelling fair asking ""big questions"" about the local economy, and a 12-month space programme. Claims to fame: Rowan Atkinson, Mark Gatiss, The Auckland Project. The south-coast city is ""uniquely positioned, facing outwards to the world"", it boasts. Its bid organisers say the contest is ""a real chance to put our city on the map - to change perceptions, showcase our diversity and give a voice to every part of our community"".

"The deepfake appeared on the hacked website of Ukrainian TV network Ukrayina 24 A deepfake video shared on Twitter, appearing to show Russian President Vladimir Putin declaring peace, has resurfaced. Meanwhile, this week Meta and YouTube have taken down a deepfake video of Ukraine's president talking of surrendering to Russia. As both sides use manipulated media, what do these videos reveal about the state of misinformation in the conflict? And are people really believing them? The unconvincing fake of President Zelensky was ridiculed by many Ukrainians. Volodymr Zelensky appears behind a podium, telling Ukrainians to put down their weapons. His head appears too large for and more pixelated than his body - and his voice sounds deeper. In a video posted to his official Instagram account, the real President Zelensky calls it a ""childish provocation"". But the Ukrainian Center for Strategic Communications had warned the Russian government may well use deepfakes to convince Ukrainians to surrender. The video of Putin has circulated for some weeks and was labelled as manipulated media by Twitter In a Twitter thread,external, Meta security-policy head Nathaniel Gleicher said it had ""quickly reviewed and removed"" the deepfake for violating its policy against misleading manipulated media. YouTube also said it had been removed for violating misinformation policies. It had been an easy win for the social-media companies, Nina Schick, author of the book Deepfakes, said, because the video was so crude and easily spotted as fake even by ""semi-sophisticated viewers"". ""The platforms can make a big hoo-ha about dealing with this,"" she said, ""when they aren't doing more on other forms of disinformation. ""There are so many other forms of disinformation in this war which haven't been debunked. ""Even though this video was really bad and crude, that won't be the case in the near future."" And it would still ""erode trust in authentic media"". ""People start to believe that everything can be faked,"" Ms Schick said ""It is a new weapon and a potent form of visual disinformation - and anyone can do it."" A tool that reanimates dead relatives proved popular and MyHeritage has now added the ability to make the deepfakes speak A deepfake tool letting users animate old photos of relatives has been widely used and the company behind it, MyHeritage, has now added LiveStory, which allows voices to be added. But there was a mixed reaction last year, when South Korean TV network MBN announced it was using a deepfake of newsreader Kim Joo-Ha. Some were impressed how realistic it was, others concerned the real Kim Joo-Ha would lose her job. Deepfake technology is also being used to create pornography, with a proliferation, in recent years, of websites letting users ""nudify"" pictures. And it can be used for satirical purposes - last year, Channel 4 created a deepfake Queen to deliver an alternative Christmas message. The use of deepfakes in politics remains relatively rare. But a deepfake former US President Barack Obama has been created, to demonstrate the technology's power. This video can not be played The tool can edit videos of people speaking and make them say something they have not ""The Zelensky was a best-case deepfake problem,"" Witness.org. programme director Sam Gregory said. ""It was not very good, for a start so was easily detected. ""And it was debunked by Ukraine and Zelensky had rebutted it on social media, so it was an easy policy takedown for Facebook."" But in other parts of the world, journalists and human-rights groups feared they had neither the tools to detect nor the ability to debunk deepfakes. Detection tools analyse the way a person moves or look for things such as the machine-learning process that created the deepfake. But last summer, an online detector suggested a genuine video of a senior politician in Myanmar, apparently confessing to corruption - debate remains over whether it was a real statement or a forced confession - was a deepfake. ""The lack of 100% proof either way and people's desire to believe it was a deepfake reflects the challenges of deepfakes in a real-world environment,"" said Mr Gregory. ""President Putin was made into a deepfake a few weeks ago and it was widely regarded as satire - but there is a thin line between satire and disinformation."" The transcript of Mr Zelensky's deepfake first appeared on the ticker of Ukrainian TV network Ukrayina 24 during a live broadcast on Wednesday. A screenshot and full transcript later appeared on its website. Ukrayina 24 confirmed,externalboth website, inaccessible for most of Wednesday, and ticker had been hacked. The video was then widely shared on Russian-language Telegram and Facebook equivalent VK. From there, it made its way to platforms such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. There have been warnings deepfakes could be dangerous, including in a conflict, for some time. But creating a believable deepfake is costly and time consuming. And old videos and doctored memes remain the most common and effective misinformation tactic in this war. Neither well made nor believable, the Zelensky deepfake is among the worst I've seen. But the fact a deepfake has now been made and shared during a war is notable. The next one may not be as bad.

"About 400 protesters gathered outside the Port of Liverpool P&O Ferries staff are staging protests after the firm sacked 800 employees without giving them any notice. The RMT and Nautilus unions are calling for action across the ports of Dover, Liverpool, Hull and Larne. Nearly a quarter of P&O Ferries' staff were told via a video message on Thursday that it was their ""final day of employment"". P&O said it took the ""difficult decision"" as a ""last resort"" to save the business. But unions have hit out against the dismissal, saying it marked a ""dark day"" in the shipping industry. A chorus of cross-party MPs described P&O Ferries' actions as ""callous"" and ""disgraceful"". The government is looking ""very closely"" at the action P&O Ferries has taken to see if they broke any laws after it fired its employees, planning to replace them with cheaper agency staff, it said. P&O Ferries sparks outrage by sacking 800 workers Protesters turn out in force against P&O sackings The RMT union labelled the move one of the ""most shameful acts in the history of British industrial relations"". Its national secretary Darren Procter told a crowd of about 250 demonstrators in Dover: ""We're going to make sure our workers get back onboard their vessels."" P&O Ferries worker Andrew Smith said he felt ""utter dismay"" after working for the company for 22 years. ""It's our lives,"" he said. ""It's how our families have grown up, knowing that this is what we do, and it's just been turned on its head within a matter of hours."" This video can not be played Sacked P&O employee Andrew Smith said he felt ""utter dismay"" at losing his job after 22 years Mark Dickinson, general secretary of the maritime trade union Nautilus, told the BBC: ""It's absolutely ripped the guts out of everybody."" ""I've seen some curveballs and some shocking developments over that time... but for a company to treat the legal process in such an underhand and callous way has shocked me."" Both the RMT union and Nautilus International are seeking legal advice on the dismissal. The transport union TSSA called on the government to ""take over running vital ferry routes to safeguard trade and travel"", and ""hit [P&O] where it hurts"" over the ""shocking events"". This video can not be played P&O Ferries workers were told via video that it was their ""final day of employment"" Holly Cudbill, an employment lawyer from Blake Morgan, said that P&O Ferries' actions ""were almost certainly illegal"". Although its boats sail around the world, she believes the firm's employees are covered by UK law. In that instance, P&O Ferries should have consulted with unions and staff about potential dismissals and notified the government that hundreds of jobs were at risk, she told the BBC. Sacked staff said the video message had referred to a ""generous severance package"" being offered, but no details were given. Maritime minister Robert Courts said he was ""frankly angry at the way workers have been treated"". He told the House of Commons P&O Ferries' actions were ""wholly unacceptable"". ""Reports of workers being given zero notice and escorted off their ships with immediate effect while being told cheaper alternatives would take up their roles, shows the insensitive nature by which P&O approached this issue,"" he said. He added that he did not expect critical goods and services to be hit by the sudden drop in capacity, but travellers ""should expect some disruption over the coming days"". The company has said services are unable to run over the next few days. Former P&O workers collect their belongings after being fired on Thursday In a letter to the prime minister, Labour's Shadow Transport Secretary Louise Haigh described the firing as a ""despicable assault on workers' rights"". ""But British seafarers do not need meaningless platitudes - they need action,"" she added, demanding that government suspends any contracts it holds with DP World - P&O Ferries' owner. Former transport minister Sir John Hayes also suggested the government should ""recover any monies granted to P&O during the pandemic"" in a bid to reverse their decision. P&O Ferries claimed almost Â£15m in government grants in 2020, which included furlough payments for its employees. The move was also condemned by the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of Dover in a joint statement, which described the sackings as ""inhumane and unethical"". Allow Twitter content?

In God's eyes it is sin,"" they said, calling for support for a consultation. P&O Ferries acknowledged on Friday that the redundancy came ""without warning or prior consultation, and we fully understand that this has caused distress for them and their families."" They added: ""We took this difficult decision as a last resort and only after full consideration of all other options but, ultimately, we concluded that the business wouldn't survive without fundamentally changed crewing arrangements, which in turn would inevitably result in redundancies."" P&O Ferries is one of the UK's leading ferry companies, carrying more than 10 million passengers a year before the pandemic and about 15% of all freight cargo in and out of the UK. It was bought by DP World, the multi-national ports and logistics company based in Dubai in 2019. At the time of purchase, its chairman Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem described it as a ""strong, recognisable brand"". It paid a Â£270m dividend to shareholders in 2020. However, like many transport operators, it saw demand slump in the pandemic. Just a couple of months after the dividends announcement, it said it would cut 1,100 jobs after a downturn in bookings. On Friday, it confirmed it is losing about Â£1m a day for each day its services are not running. Are you affected by issues covered in this story? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

"On Thursday, staff were removed from a ship docked at Larne A protest has taken place in Larne after P&O Ferries sacked 800 UK staff without giving them any notice. It will be another week before P&O shipscan operate from the County Antrim port. The Larne protest was organised by the RMT union, but also features representatives from a number of other unions. Danny McQuaid, from the union, who lost his job with P&O on Thursday, said he was ""shocked and saddened"". There were alsoprotests on Friday across the ports of Dover, Liverpool, and Hullin England. Unions are discussing possible legal action over the job cuts, and the UK government has saidit is reviewing its contracts with the firm. In a letter to the company, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said he was ""deeply concerned"" at the move and questioned whether it was legal. P&O said its survival was dependent on ""making swift and significant changes now"". 'Are the P&O Ferries sackings legal? ""I have been here about eight years, but there are some of the guys who have been here 30, 35 years,"" Mr McQuaid said, at the protest in Larne. ""They have given their lives to this company and have been part of the reason they have been such a success."" Danny McQuaid said there was no good time to lose your job but this was a particularly painful time Mr McQuaid said the way staff had been treated on Thursday was ""absolutely brutal"". ""There's no good time to lose your job, but certainly this is particularly painful, not just for me, but a lot of the guys - there are some young guys with families and mortgages to pay,"" he added. P&O Ferry customers face stressful changes 'We've been abandoned by P&O' say sacked staff Nearly a quarter of P&O Ferries' UK staff were told via a pre-recorded video message on Thursday that it was their ""final day of employment"". Gale Dowey has worked for P&O since 1994, joining the company at 18. Ms Dowey works on board the ship for two weeks at a time which amounts to living on board for six months of the year. ""It's my life, it's the only life I know,"" she said. ""We eat together, we're with each other 24/7 and we spend longer together than we do with our families."" Ms Dowey, who is also a RMT union official, said P&O prided itself in having employees with long service. ""I took phone call after phone call yesterday from grown men, crying, asking me how they're going to go home to their wife and children and tell them they no longer have a career."" Gale Dowey (centre) says she is worried about the rising cost of living after losing her job On Thursday, private security officers were sent on to a ship docked at Larne to remove staff. ""They were told they would be handcuffed and removed if they didn't comply,"" she said. She said staff were taken to their cabins and told they had five minutes to fill a bag and leave the ship. ""They left the ship yesterday absolutely humiliated, they were treated like common criminals for working for this company and being loyal, long serving employees,"" she added. Ms Dowey said she had no idea what to do next and was worried about the cost of her mortgage and rising cost of living. The temporary halting of P&O's sailings at Larne Port will affect supplies coming into Northern Ireland as other ferry operators are ""pretty near full"", Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots has said. Mr Poots said there was not the capacity and there would be consequences. ""There are export materials that need to get out of Northern Ireland which won't get out,"" he told BBC's The View programme. ""About 50% of our food is exported out of Great Britain, so that is a real problem for us."" Stormont's economy and agriculture committees held emergency meetings, in closed session, on Friday to discuss the implications for supply chains. Nearly a quarter of P&O Ferries' UK staff were told about the job cuts via a pre-recorded video message on Thursday The disruption to the goods supply chains was currently ""manageable"", the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium (NIRC) said. However, as P&O sailings are a key part of Northern Ireland's retail logistics infrastructure, the matter needed to be resolved ""very quickly"", added NIRC's director AodhÃ¡n Connolly. He said retailers had stock in large distribution centres which should last for about four or five days. Retailers were looking at alternative Irish Sea options such as using the ports of Belfast and Warrenpoint in Northern Ireland and Dublin in the Republic of Ireland, he added. With regard to the transport of goods to and from mainland Europe, Mr Connolly said retailers were also considering using the Eurotunnel or air freight. Allow Twitter content?

"The brothers were lost in the Amazon during its rainy season, when moving in the jungle is even more difficult than usual Two young indigenous boys rescued after almost four weeks lost in Brazil's Amazon rainforest have been found and taken to hospital. Glauco and Gleison Ferreira, eight and six, got lost trying to catch small birds in the jungle near ManicorÃ©, Amazonas state, on 18 February. A local tree cutter found them by chance on Tuesday. They are expected to make a full recovery after being treated in hospital for malnourishment. After the boys disappeared, hundreds of residents spent weeks looking for them. But lost during the rainy season of the Amazon - a time which makes walking and moving in the jungle even more difficult than usual - they were nowhere to be found. Emergency services decided to call off the search on 24 February, but locals continued to search for the boys, according to local media outlet AmazÃ´nia Real. Almost four weeks later, the boys were found by a man cutting wood 6 km (3.7 miles) from the village of Palmeira in the Lago CapanÃ£ protected land reserve where the boys live with their parents, AmazÃ´nia Real adds. One of the boys shouted for help when he heard the local man hitting the trees nearby. Following the calls, the man found the two boys lying on the rainforest floor, hungry and weak, with many skin abrasions. According to local media, the two boys told their parents they had eaten nothing while lost and had had only rainwater to drink. Upon their discovery, Glauco and Gleison were sent to a regional hospital in ManicorÃ©, before being transported by helicopter to another hospital in Manaus on Thursday morning, Globo reports. This is not the first time people have got lost in the Amazon rainforest. In January last year, pilot Antonio Senaspent 36 days lost in one of the remotest parts of the Brazilian Amazonafter his aircraft crashed. In 2008, AmazÃ´nia Real reports an indigenous 18-year-old was lost for 50 days in a remote area of the Amazon after going hunting, and died shortly after he was found.

"Anna Kozachenko's Milk Bar is producing 500 free meals per day to help feed people in Kyiv Kyiv restaurant the Milk Bar used to charge Â£12 a meal, now it's producing 500 meals a day for free to help feed the citizens of the Ukrainian capital. The restaurant has not been able to pay its staff since February but it still has 20 people working there. ""We are all just thinking about people and the community right now,"" bakery owner Anna Kozachenko said. Hers is just one of the food businesses stepping up to support Ukrainians following the invasion by Russia. ""I'm not even thinking about the financial losses,"" said Ms Kozachenko. The staff who have stayed with the firm are now working around the clock to deliver meals to the elderly and refugees from invaded areas outside Kyiv. Large food suppliers have provided food to the restaurant for free and have promised to do so for ""as long as it is needed"". The landlord has also suspended rent for the restaurant. The Milk Bar is one of more than 450 restaurants that have transformed their businesses to help feed anyone who needs it following Russia's invasion of Ukraine - people sheltering in bunkers, the elderly unable to leave their home, and those fighting on the front lines. One larger firm, LaFamiglia Group, which has 14 restaurants, a catering business and 17 food markets, has also now switched to providing shelters, food and medical supplies. The business, which made tens of millions in dollars in sales last year, is now providing more than 8,000 snacks and sandwiches and more than 5,000 hot meals each day for free. Owner Mikhail Beylin told the BBC suppliers were providing lots of food for free and the rest was being sold at cost, with them not making a profit from it. The restaurant is using its own money to cover any additional costs. Vino e Cucina restaurant in Kyiv before the war Mr Beylin said the war had made getting food to and from the restaurant ""complicated"" and there are fears that they could run out of supplies. ""Now the supply we get is enough to cover the demand and create a small back-up of products in case we face a scarcity,"" he added. Allow Twitter content?

""Our chefs remain in the middle of military zones to provide our people with food."" ""It's not the time to worry about finances, profits and margins, now is the time for actions that are required of everyone in order to stop further destruction of lives."" Anna Kozachenko at the bakery before the war Pizzeria owner Ruslan Buriak has 60 volunteers working around the clock at his kitchens in the central-eastern city of Dnipro, which was first targeted by Russian air strikes last week. The kitchens are producing about 1,000 meals each day for the local population and has been relying on free pasta, oils and meat from local farmers. Like the Milk Bar, Mr Buriak also makes deliveries to elderly people and those unable to leave their homes. ""We have around one week of stock left and the volunteer chefs need money to get buses to work,"" Mr Buriak explained. ""We're like a family now and everyone is doing their best to help."" One of Ukraine's biggest food producers MHP, which grows and distributes wheat, is helping restaurants to keep going and feed people during the conflict, including Mr Beylin's chain. It employs more than 30,000 workers across Ukraine. It has delivered food to isolated communities across the country, but the invasion means some parts of Ukraine where it would normally sow wheat are now inaccessible. ""If this continues, of course our ability to sow rapidly diminishes, particularly if they (the Russian army) moves into the west of the country where a large part of our operations are based"", MHP bossDr John Rich told the BBC. Owner of the LaFamiglia Group of restaurants, Mikhail Beylin This would have an impact which reaches far beyond Ukraine. Some 30% of the world's wheat comes from Ukraine and Russia. The majority of Ukraine's wheat and corn exports went to the Middle East or Africa last year - and disruptions to supply could affect availability in these areas. If grain production is hampered, analysts have warned supplies may struggle to keep up with demand, meaning wheat prices could rise across the globe. In the meantime, the government is doing what it can to help financially. It has restarted support schemes put in place to help restaurants cope with the Covid pandemic. Dr Tymofii Mylovanov, president of the Kyiv School of Economics, expects the government to take a larger role in supporting the country's firms as they switch from making sales and profit to trying to help the country's people survive the war. ""Many restaurants have now run out of money but the government is providing relief and co-ordinating people's demand as we continue into a war economy,"" Dr Mylovanov said. Meanwhile MHP has also appealed for donations to its charitable foundation so it can continue to distribute food. Preparing food containers at the pizzeria in Dnipro Back in Dnipro, Mr Buriak's landlord has also halted rent, water and electricity bills to help support the pizzeria and people are continuing to volunteer their time for free. Mr Buriak plans to keep feeding Dnipro for as long as stocks remain. ""We will keep going until the end of this situation but no one knows how long this will take.""

"This video can not be played WATCH: The BBC's Quentin Sommerville follows Ukrainian troops holding the front line as Russia pounds Kharkiv Ukraine's second city Kharkiv has been the constant target of Russian attacks for three weeks. The BBC's Quentin Sommerville and cameraman Darren Conway report from the front line where Ukrainian troops continue to repel the enemy advance. We enter the house where the back door used to be. Now there is just a blanket flapping in the freezing wind. The owners, long gone, would have had a view across the rich farmland north of Kharkiv, but much of that is unrecognisable, too. In the garage, beside an abandoned skateboard, are a dozen or so empty packing cases for some of the world's best anti-tank weapons. A dead Russian soldier lies face down in the front garden. The house has become a frontline base, and the spent cases are an indication that the soldiers here have had the fight of their lives - a fight for Ukraine's independence. We have gained rare access to the Ukrainian army, who after three weeks of hard fighting, are still holding firm on the outskirts of Kharkiv, preventing Russian forces from capturing Ukraine's second-largest city. ""Do you want to go further ahead?"" asks Yuri, a commander with the Ukrainian army's 22 Motorized Infantry Battalion, pointing at the ruins of two Russian armoured personnel carriers, and the shattered pieces of two of their tanks. The battalion was reconstituted in 2014 after Russia invaded Crimea and backed Donbas separatists. ""They've used drones, aircraft, attack helicopters, everything,"" says Yuri, as Russian shells thunder overhead, striking nearby roads and apartment blocks. Moments after Russian Grad rockets - multiple rockets launched in quick succession - fell on a residential neighbourhood The Russians have continued to attack again and been repelled many times. In their frustration at being denied entry, they bomb the city, which was once home to 1.4 million people, day and night. The ground is churned up and thick mud sucks on your boots. A backward glance shows the ruined shells of the line of houses we just passed through. Suburban gardens have become battlefields from Europe's past. ""The first three days were the worst. It was raining, we were covered in mud, we looked like pigs,"" says Olexander, 44, who is standing nearby. By one of the destroyed armoured personnel carriers, its Z marking already faded, is a large crater, 20ft (6m) across. On the first day of the invasion, 24 February, a Russian strike killed six Ukrainian soldiers at this exact place. Many more died here since, but official figures aren't being released. A green army boot is perched on the crater's edge, a Russian corpse beyond that. A large black crow sits nearby, untroubled by the roar of shelling and Grad rockets from Russian positions. The men here can tell you the precise date and time they came to the front - the implication being that if you weren't here the first three days, you don't know real fighting. ""Jump in the crater if there is more shelling,"" says Uri. Constantine, 58, was a pilot in the Ukrainian air force until he retired and became a journalist. Now he's back at the front, walking with a limp and using a broken broom handle for support. Russian shrapnel wounded his leg, but he refuses to leave the front. ""This is the last line of defence for the city, if they get through here, they will enter Kharkiv. This road takes you from Russia to the very heart of the city,"" he says. Olexander, 44, who fought in Donbas - ""For the first three days, we couldn't understand what was going on"" There is a boom and whoosh, and a wire-guided missile flies just over our heads. We scramble into the crater. It strikes along the roadside, a gas pipeline bursts into flames. While we shelter, a tall reconnaissance soldier with blue tape across his helmet tells us to stay down. Roman is 34 years old, though he jokes that he was 24 when the war started three weeks ago. He says the Russians won't show themselves now. ""They are chickens. We will respond good and proper."" He stops and asks for a selfie. Later we learn that he transported the dead bodies of his fallen comrades in his own vehicle - which was just a month old - from the front to the city morgue. As we leave, Constantine catches something in the air - thin copper wire, which stretches for miles. It was used to guide the Russian missile which just flew over our heads. Waiting for us is Olexander, 44, from nearby Poltava region. He's been with the unit since its founding and has fought in Donbas. ""This is much worse,"" he says, adding: ""For the first three days, we couldn't understand what was going on. We were lost and we couldn't believe it was happening. But after that we got better and we are standing our ground and will hold our positions."" I ask him why he is fighting. He gives a laugh and responds, ""For a free Ukraine, for my family, and for you guys as well. For our independence and for peace."" Yuri, the commander, drives us back to the collection of Soviet-era apartment blocks, still inhabited. Russia says it came to Ukraine to demilitarise the country, but here we see what that means for civilians. A 20-storey block is still smoking from a Russian strike - it was two days ago, according to Yuri. The official number of civilian deaths in Kharkiv stood at 234, including 14 children, on 16 March. The past few days have been punishing - as we were reminded in an instant. A volley of Russian Grad rockets rained down on the neighbourhood, striking just metres away. The soldiers around us had taken cover and were unharmed. Svitlana. 72, and her husband sleep two hours a night in their bomb-damaged flat In the same housing complex lives husband and wife Svitlana and Sasha. Svitlana is 72, and welcomes us into her home, saying they haven't spoken to anyone in weeks. ""We're glad you came,"" she says. Their building has already been hit, the back windows are gone, and they sleep in a central room on sofas. They manage two hours of sleep a night, the shelling is relentless. ""When it stops, it is like a thaw in spring,"" she says. I ask if she has a message for Vladimir Putin. ""No,"" she replies, firmly. ""No, it seems to me that this man has already lost his sanity and he does not think clearly. Because a sane human can not do something like this - bomb old people, kids, kindergartens, schools, hospitals. He wouldn't understand what I say."" But then, when I ask about the men not far from her home who are defending the city, she cries. She says, ""Yes, I'm very grateful to them for protecting their homeland. Hold on guys. We will always support you. They are so brave, both boys and girls."" There are still hundreds of thousands of people living in Kharkiv, despite the shelling. If Russia and Ukraine are brothers, as the Kremlin professes, then this is fratricide. As we leave the neighbourhood, much of it is alight. Russia's fury with this city is both seen and heard. By evening, all of Kharkiv is covered in a cloud of smoke, the relentless pounding of guns continues, but the defenders of Kharkiv still keep the enemy from the city gates.

"Burger King has 800 stores in Russia The owner of Burger King said the operator of its 800 stores in Russia has ""refused"" to close the sites despite demands to suspend trading. Restaurant Brands said it had contacted local partner, Alexander Kolobov, to shut the shops amid the war in Ukraine. But it said ""complicated"" contracts with overseas partners mean it is unable to ""walk away"" from these deals. Mr Kolobov told the BBC he does not have the ""authority or power"" to stop Burger King operations in Russia. But he said any closure must be approved by all investors in the business. ""The decision to terminate and suspend operations of the franchisee which employs about 25,000 persons must be taken by all shareholders considering impact it may have on the employees and their families,"" he said. Many Western firms have shut or suspended their Russian businesses because of the country's invasion of Ukraine. However a small number, including Burger King and UK retailer Marks and Spencer (M&S), have been unable to do so because their stores are run by franchise partners under ""complex"" legal arrangements. The Western brands unable to leave Russia Growing numbers of firms pull back from Russia In a letter to staff,external, Restaurant Brands International president David Shear said: ""We contacted the main operator of the business and demanded the suspension of Burger King restaurant operations in Russia. ""He has refused to do so."" Mr Shear added that making any changes to its local Burger King business ""would ultimately require the support of Russian authorities on the ground and we know that will not practically happen anytime soon"". Burger King entered the Russian market 10 years ago. It trades there through a joint venture partnership with Mr Kolobov - who is the main day-to-day operator of the business - as well as with Russia's VTB Capital and a Ukrainian investment firm. VTB Capital is an affiliate of VTB Bank, Russia's second largest financial institution which has been sanctioned by the US, UK and other European countries. Mr Kolobov said he owns a 30% stake in the joint venture.""Since the date of the establishment (of) the joint venture-franchisee... my share has always been far below control,"" he said. Mr Shear said Restaurant Brands owns a minority stake of 15% in the Russian joint venture which it is in the process of unwinding. ""While we would like to do this immediately, it is clear that it will take some time to do so based on the terms of our existing joint venture agreement,"" he said. Restaurant Brands has stopped supporting the supply chain, operations and marketing for Russia. It will also reject new pitches for investment and expansion in Russia. Western companies remain under pressure to withdraw from Russia following its attack on Ukraine. On Thursday, a group of four Ukrainian MPs highlighted to UK prime minister Boris Johnson that M&S is still open in Russia. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

MP Alona Shkrum said: ""It is very important to put Putin in isolation and for him to know he will not be getting a handshake from the world, he will not be getting a handshake from business, there will be no support for him because he has killed children in Ukraine."" Complex franchise agreements have prevented some Western brands from shutting their stores in Russia. They have, however, publicly shunned the country over its invasion of Ukraine. Marks & Spencer stores are operated by a Turkish company called FiBA, which has held the rights to sell the retailer's products across Eastern Europe, since 1999. M&S said it has suspended shipments of its goods to FiBA which runs Marks' 48 stores in Russia. Meanwhile, German carmaker Audi has warned that the war in Ukraine will cause ""tremendous interference"" to supply chains. ""We will see tremendous interference with all the supply chains, not just the chip business, but any supply chains internationally,"" said Audi executive Hildegard Wortmann.

"Katya Osadcha set up the group Thousands of families have been separated in the chaos of fighting in Ukraine. Power cuts and disruption to internet and mobile phone services mean many have gone weeks without hearing news of loved ones in areas hit by intense Russian shelling. Sergey was sheltering with his family in a bomb shelter when he left to get food. Fierce fighting meant he couldn't get back to them, and the next day his phone went dead. Desperate for news, his brother Vladimir turned to a Telegram group set by a Ukrainian TV presenter which shares information about missing people. The group, called Search for the Missing, has grown to more than 80,000 members since it launched earlier this month, and receives thousands of pleas for help every day. Hours after he posted about his brother, and four days after Sergey went missing, Vladimir got a phone call from the family of Sergey's wife in Kyiv, who had seen the message. ""By the end of the day, they called to tell me that my brother had made his way to them,"" Vladimir said. Sergey was traced via the group Sergey had made it to another shelter, but with no food and water, he and the people he was with decided to surrender to Russian troops. ""They took a white flag and went out to the Russians. After a search, they were released. Then with the help of volunteers, he drove to Kyiv,"" Vladimir says. The rest of Sergey's family eventually made it out of Bucha and to safety in Gdansk, Poland. ""I experienced feelings that I have never experienced in my life,"" Vladimir says. ""It was such welcome news in these difficult days."" Sergey has since returned to Ukraine to join the army, he says. Search for the Missing was started by Katya Osadcha, a former model, journalist and popular reality TV presenter. She was desperate to help when the war started, but felt she ""couldn't shoot or be a soldier"" because she has two small children. Instead, she asked friends on Instagram to help and now she and 15 volunteers run the group 24 hours a day, checking each message for details, and filtering out duplicates. 'Overwhelmed' Katya says they have helped about 300 people find missing relatives, each one a happy update - a flurry of red hearts, praying and crying emojis - among the channel's endless stream of desperate pleas for information. ""You receive pictures of happy people on holidays, and their friends and family are writing to us saying that they are missing and the last call was five days ago from a shelter, and there has been a lot of bombing."" Emma Shymanovych, who helps run the channel, says the small team of volunteers has been overwhelmed: ""It's extremely painful to read enquiries about lost children, or about children looking for their parents. It's hard to express what we feel."" When Yulia (left) escaped Mariupol the rest of her family stayed behind Yulia, 25, left her mother, brother and sister behind when she escaped the city of Mariupol with her husband and two-month-old baby: ""The last time I spoke to them, they had not had electricity, water, heating and communications for several days."" When she couldn't get through to them, Yulia contacted local authorities and friends who might still be in the city to see if they knew anything, but got nowhere, and posted on the Telegram channel. ""I push the worst thoughts away from me,"" she said. ""I really hope they're safe and they just don't have a connection. I only hope for an immediate ceasefire."" Not long after we spoke, Yulia sent me a message to tell me her mother had finally been able to make contact, but was still in Mariupol. ""She spoke for just a minute. Thank God!"" Iryna posted a picture of her friend's 23-year-old daughter Julia, after she went missing in Kyiv. ""Her mother was crying constantly,"" she says. She tried asking for news on Facebook and other Telegram channels, eventually turning to Search for the Missing. Julia had dropped her phone when she was running to a bomb shelter ""Within 24 hours I started getting responses from people who knew her. Some said they didn't know anything, but then her friends got in touch and said Julia had broken her phone and hadn't been able to make contact."" Julia had dropped her phone when she was running to a bomb shelter and she didn't know her mother's phone number off by heart. Thousands more are still trapped in Mariupol. Olga, who lives in Istanbul, posted in the channel after losing contact with her 31-year-old daughter Daria and her two grandchildren Mark, 4, and Lydia, 5, who live there. Olga has lost contact with her daughter Daria (right) and grandchildren Mark and Lydia Olga last heard from her daughter on 28 February. In a text message, Daria wrote that a shell had hit their apartment building, and there was no electricity or heating. ""I don't know what to do at all"" the message said. ""I'm scared. The children are dressed, there are a lot of blankets. Mariupol is encircled by the enemy. We have a very bad connection."" Olga has almost given up hope of hearing from them. Monday was her daughter's birthday. ""I'm terrified of everything and I never thought that my family would be affected by war"" she says. Olga, from Bakhmut, posted in the group to try to find news of her daughter, Alice, and eight-month-old grandson, Timofey, in Mariupol. The last she heard from them, they were sheltering with neighbours in the basement of a supermarket without electricity, water or heating. Alice and Timofey were last heard of sheltering in a supermarket basement Since then, she has received a message that the building they were hiding in was bombed, and she is anxiously waiting for more news.

"About 400 protesters gathered outside the Port of Liverpool P&O Ferries staff are staging protests after the firm sacked 800 employees without giving them any notice. The RMT and Nautilus unions are calling for action across the ports of Dover, Liverpool, Hull and Larne. Nearly a quarter of P&O Ferries' staff were told via a video message on Thursday that it was their ""final day of employment"". P&O said it took the ""difficult decision"" as a ""last resort"" to save the business. But unions have hit out against the dismissal, saying it marked a ""dark day"" in the shipping industry. A chorus of cross-party MPs described P&O Ferries' actions as ""callous"" and ""disgraceful"". The government is looking ""very closely"" at the action P&O Ferries has taken to see if they broke any laws after it fired its employees, planning to replace them with cheaper agency staff, it said. P&O Ferries sparks outrage by sacking 800 workers Protesters turn out in force against P&O sackings The RMT union labelled the move one of the ""most shameful acts in the history of British industrial relations"". Its national secretary Darren Procter told a crowd of about 250 demonstrators in Dover: ""We're going to make sure our workers get back onboard their vessels."" P&O Ferries worker Andrew Smith said he felt ""utter dismay"" after working for the company for 22 years. ""It's our lives,"" he said. ""It's how our families have grown up, knowing that this is what we do, and it's just been turned on its head within a matter of hours."" This video can not be played Sacked P&O employee Andrew Smith said he felt ""utter dismay"" at losing his job after 22 years Mark Dickinson, general secretary of the maritime trade union Nautilus, told the BBC: ""It's absolutely ripped the guts out of everybody."" ""I've seen some curveballs and some shocking developments over that time... but for a company to treat the legal process in such an underhand and callous way has shocked me."" Both the RMT union and Nautilus International are seeking legal advice on the dismissal. The transport union TSSA called on the government to ""take over running vital ferry routes to safeguard trade and travel"", and ""hit [P&O] where it hurts"" over the ""shocking events"". This video can not be played P&O Ferries workers were told via video that it was their ""final day of employment"" Holly Cudbill, an employment lawyer from Blake Morgan, said that P&O Ferries' actions ""were almost certainly illegal"". Although its boats sail around the world, she believes the firm's employees are covered by UK law. In that instance, P&O Ferries should have consulted with unions and staff about potential dismissals and notified the government that hundreds of jobs were at risk, she told the BBC. Sacked staff said the video message had referred to a ""generous severance package"" being offered, but no details were given. Maritime minister Robert Courts said he was ""frankly angry at the way workers have been treated"". He told the House of Commons P&O Ferries' actions were ""wholly unacceptable"". ""Reports of workers being given zero notice and escorted off their ships with immediate effect while being told cheaper alternatives would take up their roles, shows the insensitive nature by which P&O approached this issue,"" he said. He added that he did not expect critical goods and services to be hit by the sudden drop in capacity, but travellers ""should expect some disruption over the coming days"". The company has said services are unable to run over the next few days. Former P&O workers collect their belongings after being fired on Thursday In a letter to the prime minister, Labour's Shadow Transport Secretary Louise Haigh described the firing as a ""despicable assault on workers' rights"". ""But British seafarers do not need meaningless platitudes - they need action,"" she added, demanding that government suspends any contracts it holds with DP World - P&O Ferries' owner. Former transport minister Sir John Hayes also suggested the government should ""recover any monies granted to P&O during the pandemic"" in a bid to reverse their decision. P&O Ferries claimed almost Â£15m in government grants in 2020, which included furlough payments for its employees. The move was also condemned by the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of Dover in a joint statement, which described the sackings as ""inhumane and unethical"". Allow Twitter content?

In God's eyes it is sin,"" they said, calling for support for a consultation. P&O Ferries acknowledged on Friday that the redundancy came ""without warning or prior consultation, and we fully understand that this has caused distress for them and their families."" They added: ""We took this difficult decision as a last resort and only after full consideration of all other options but, ultimately, we concluded that the business wouldn't survive without fundamentally changed crewing arrangements, which in turn would inevitably result in redundancies."" P&O Ferries is one of the UK's leading ferry companies, carrying more than 10 million passengers a year before the pandemic and about 15% of all freight cargo in and out of the UK. It was bought by DP World, the multi-national ports and logistics company based in Dubai in 2019. At the time of purchase, its chairman Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem described it as a ""strong, recognisable brand"". It paid a Â£270m dividend to shareholders in 2020. However, like many transport operators, it saw demand slump in the pandemic. Just a couple of months after the dividends announcement, it said it would cut 1,100 jobs after a downturn in bookings. On Friday, it confirmed it is losing about Â£1m a day for each day its services are not running. Are you affected by issues covered in this story? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

"This video can not be played WATCH: The BBC's Quentin Sommerville follows Ukrainian troops holding the front line as Russia pounds Kharkiv Ukraine's second city Kharkiv has been the constant target of Russian attacks for three weeks. The BBC's Quentin Sommerville and cameraman Darren Conway report from the front line where Ukrainian troops continue to repel the enemy advance. We enter the house where the back door used to be. Now there is just a blanket flapping in the freezing wind. The owners, long gone, would have had a view across the rich farmland north of Kharkiv, but much of that is unrecognisable, too. In the garage, beside an abandoned skateboard, are a dozen or so empty packing cases for some of the world's best anti-tank weapons. A dead Russian soldier lies face down in the front garden. The house has become a frontline base, and the spent cases are an indication that the soldiers here have had the fight of their lives - a fight for Ukraine's independence. We have gained rare access to the Ukrainian army, who after three weeks of hard fighting, are still holding firm on the outskirts of Kharkiv, preventing Russian forces from capturing Ukraine's second-largest city. ""Do you want to go further ahead?"" asks Yuri, a commander with the Ukrainian army's 22 Motorized Infantry Battalion, pointing at the ruins of two Russian armoured personnel carriers, and the shattered pieces of two of their tanks. The battalion was reconstituted in 2014 after Russia invaded Crimea and backed Donbas separatists. ""They've used drones, aircraft, attack helicopters, everything,"" says Yuri, as Russian shells thunder overhead, striking nearby roads and apartment blocks. Moments after Russian Grad rockets - multiple rockets launched in quick succession - fell on a residential neighbourhood The Russians have continued to attack again and been repelled many times. In their frustration at being denied entry, they bomb the city, which was once home to 1.4 million people, day and night. The ground is churned up and thick mud sucks on your boots. A backward glance shows the ruined shells of the line of houses we just passed through. Suburban gardens have become battlefields from Europe's past. ""The first three days were the worst. It was raining, we were covered in mud, we looked like pigs,"" says Olexander, 44, who is standing nearby. By one of the destroyed armoured personnel carriers, its Z marking already faded, is a large crater, 20ft (6m) across. On the first day of the invasion, 24 February, a Russian strike killed six Ukrainian soldiers at this exact place. Many more died here since, but official figures aren't being released. A green army boot is perched on the crater's edge, a Russian corpse beyond that. A large black crow sits nearby, untroubled by the roar of shelling and Grad rockets from Russian positions. The men here can tell you the precise date and time they came to the front - the implication being that if you weren't here the first three days, you don't know real fighting. ""Jump in the crater if there is more shelling,"" says Uri. Constantine, 58, was a pilot in the Ukrainian air force until he retired and became a journalist. Now he's back at the front, walking with a limp and using a broken broom handle for support. Russian shrapnel wounded his leg, but he refuses to leave the front. ""This is the last line of defence for the city, if they get through here, they will enter Kharkiv. This road takes you from Russia to the very heart of the city,"" he says. Olexander, 44, who fought in Donbas - ""For the first three days, we couldn't understand what was going on"" There is a boom and whoosh, and a wire-guided missile flies just over our heads. We scramble into the crater. It strikes along the roadside, a gas pipeline bursts into flames. While we shelter, a tall reconnaissance soldier with blue tape across his helmet tells us to stay down. Roman is 34 years old, though he jokes that he was 24 when the war started three weeks ago. He says the Russians won't show themselves now. ""They are chickens. We will respond good and proper."" He stops and asks for a selfie. Later we learn that he transported the dead bodies of his fallen comrades in his own vehicle - which was just a month old - from the front to the city morgue. As we leave, Constantine catches something in the air - thin copper wire, which stretches for miles. It was used to guide the Russian missile which just flew over our heads. Waiting for us is Olexander, 44, from nearby Poltava region. He's been with the unit since its founding and has fought in Donbas. ""This is much worse,"" he says, adding: ""For the first three days, we couldn't understand what was going on. We were lost and we couldn't believe it was happening. But after that we got better and we are standing our ground and will hold our positions."" I ask him why he is fighting. He gives a laugh and responds, ""For a free Ukraine, for my family, and for you guys as well. For our independence and for peace."" Yuri, the commander, drives us back to the collection of Soviet-era apartment blocks, still inhabited. Russia says it came to Ukraine to demilitarise the country, but here we see what that means for civilians. A 20-storey block is still smoking from a Russian strike - it was two days ago, according to Yuri. The official number of civilian deaths in Kharkiv stood at 234, including 14 children, on 16 March. The past few days have been punishing - as we were reminded in an instant. A volley of Russian Grad rockets rained down on the neighbourhood, striking just metres away. The soldiers around us had taken cover and were unharmed. Svitlana. 72, and her husband sleep two hours a night in their bomb-damaged flat In the same housing complex lives husband and wife Svitlana and Sasha. Svitlana is 72, and welcomes us into her home, saying they haven't spoken to anyone in weeks. ""We're glad you came,"" she says. Their building has already been hit, the back windows are gone, and they sleep in a central room on sofas. They manage two hours of sleep a night, the shelling is relentless. ""When it stops, it is like a thaw in spring,"" she says. I ask if she has a message for Vladimir Putin. ""No,"" she replies, firmly. ""No, it seems to me that this man has already lost his sanity and he does not think clearly. Because a sane human can not do something like this - bomb old people, kids, kindergartens, schools, hospitals. He wouldn't understand what I say."" But then, when I ask about the men not far from her home who are defending the city, she cries. She says, ""Yes, I'm very grateful to them for protecting their homeland. Hold on guys. We will always support you. They are so brave, both boys and girls."" There are still hundreds of thousands of people living in Kharkiv, despite the shelling. If Russia and Ukraine are brothers, as the Kremlin professes, then this is fratricide. As we leave the neighbourhood, much of it is alight. Russia's fury with this city is both seen and heard. By evening, all of Kharkiv is covered in a cloud of smoke, the relentless pounding of guns continues, but the defenders of Kharkiv still keep the enemy from the city gates.

"Burger King has 800 stores in Russia The owner of Burger King said the operator of its 800 stores in Russia has ""refused"" to close the sites despite demands to suspend trading. Restaurant Brands said it had contacted local partner, Alexander Kolobov, to shut the shops amid the war in Ukraine. But it said ""complicated"" contracts with overseas partners mean it is unable to ""walk away"" from these deals. Mr Kolobov told the BBC he does not have the ""authority or power"" to stop Burger King operations in Russia. But he said any closure must be approved by all investors in the business. ""The decision to terminate and suspend operations of the franchisee which employs about 25,000 persons must be taken by all shareholders considering impact it may have on the employees and their families,"" he said. Many Western firms have shut or suspended their Russian businesses because of the country's invasion of Ukraine. However a small number, including Burger King and UK retailer Marks and Spencer (M&S), have been unable to do so because their stores are run by franchise partners under ""complex"" legal arrangements. The Western brands unable to leave Russia Growing numbers of firms pull back from Russia In a letter to staff,external, Restaurant Brands International president David Shear said: ""We contacted the main operator of the business and demanded the suspension of Burger King restaurant operations in Russia. ""He has refused to do so."" Mr Shear added that making any changes to its local Burger King business ""would ultimately require the support of Russian authorities on the ground and we know that will not practically happen anytime soon"". Burger King entered the Russian market 10 years ago. It trades there through a joint venture partnership with Mr Kolobov - who is the main day-to-day operator of the business - as well as with Russia's VTB Capital and a Ukrainian investment firm. VTB Capital is an affiliate of VTB Bank, Russia's second largest financial institution which has been sanctioned by the US, UK and other European countries. Mr Kolobov said he owns a 30% stake in the joint venture.""Since the date of the establishment (of) the joint venture-franchisee... my share has always been far below control,"" he said. Mr Shear said Restaurant Brands owns a minority stake of 15% in the Russian joint venture which it is in the process of unwinding. ""While we would like to do this immediately, it is clear that it will take some time to do so based on the terms of our existing joint venture agreement,"" he said.

MP Alona Shkrum said: ""It is very important to put Putin in isolation and for him to know he will not be getting a handshake from the world, he will not be getting a handshake from business, there will be no support for him because he has killed children in Ukraine.""

M&S said it has suspended shipments of its goods to FiBA which runs Marks' 48 stores in Russia. Meanwhile, German carmaker Audi has warned that the war in Ukraine will cause ""tremendous interference"" to supply chains. ""We will see tremendous interference with all the supply chains, not just the chip business, but any supply chains internationally,"" said Audi executive Hildegard Wortmann.

"About 400 protesters gathered outside the Port of Liverpool P&O Ferries staff are staging protests after the firm sacked 800 employees without giving them any notice. The RMT and Nautilus unions are calling for action across the ports of Dover, Liverpool, Hull and Larne. Nearly a quarter of P&O Ferries' staff were told via a video message on Thursday that it was their ""final day of employment"". P&O said it took the ""difficult decision"" as a ""last resort"" to save the business. But unions have hit out against the dismissal, saying it marked a ""dark day"" in the shipping industry. A chorus of cross-party MPs described P&O Ferries' actions as ""callous"" and ""disgraceful"". The government is looking ""very closely"" at the action P&O Ferries has taken to see if they broke any laws after it fired its employees, planning to replace them with cheaper agency staff, it said. P&O Ferries sparks outrage by sacking 800 workers Protesters turn out in force against P&O sackings The RMT union labelled the move one of the ""most shameful acts in the history of British industrial relations"". Its national secretary Darren Procter told a crowd of about 250 demonstrators in Dover: ""We're going to make sure our workers get back onboard their vessels."" P&O Ferries worker Andrew Smith said he felt ""utter dismay"" after working for the company for 22 years. ""It's our lives,"" he said. ""It's how our families have grown up, knowing that this is what we do, and it's just been turned on its head within a matter of hours."" This video can not be played Sacked P&O employee Andrew Smith said he felt ""utter dismay"" at losing his job after 22 years Mark Dickinson, general secretary of the maritime trade union Nautilus, told the BBC: ""It's absolutely ripped the guts out of everybody."" ""I've seen some curveballs and some shocking developments over that time... but for a company to treat the legal process in such an underhand and callous way has shocked me."" Both the RMT union and Nautilus International are seeking legal advice on the dismissal. The transport union TSSA called on the government to ""take over running vital ferry routes to safeguard trade and travel"", and ""hit [P&O] where it hurts"" over the ""shocking events"". This video can not be played P&O Ferries workers were told via video that it was their ""final day of employment"" Holly Cudbill, an employment lawyer from Blake Morgan, said that P&O Ferries' actions ""were almost certainly illegal"". Although its boats sail around the world, she believes the firm's employees are covered by UK law. In that instance, P&O Ferries should have consulted with unions and staff about potential dismissals and notified the government that hundreds of jobs were at risk, she told the BBC. Sacked staff said the video message had referred to a ""generous severance package"" being offered, but no details were given. Maritime minister Robert Courts said he was ""frankly angry at the way workers have been treated"". He told the House of Commons P&O Ferries' actions were ""wholly unacceptable"". ""Reports of workers being given zero notice and escorted off their ships with immediate effect while being told cheaper alternatives would take up their roles, shows the insensitive nature by which P&O approached this issue,"" he said. He added that he did not expect critical goods and services to be hit by the sudden drop in capacity, but travellers ""should expect some disruption over the coming days"". The company has said services are unable to run over the next few days. Former P&O workers collect their belongings after being fired on Thursday In a letter to the prime minister, Labour's Shadow Transport Secretary Louise Haigh described the firing as a ""despicable assault on workers' rights"". ""But British seafarers do not need meaningless platitudes - they need action,"" she added, demanding that government suspends any contracts it holds with DP World - P&O Ferries' owner. Former transport minister Sir John Hayes also suggested the government should ""recover any monies granted to P&O during the pandemic"" in a bid to reverse their decision. P&O Ferries claimed almost Â£15m in government grants in 2020, which included furlough payments for its employees. The move was also condemned by the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of Dover in a joint statement, which described the sackings as ""inhumane and unethical"". Allow Twitter content?

In God's eyes it is sin,"" they said, calling for support for a consultation. P&O Ferries acknowledged on Friday that the redundancy came ""without warning or prior consultation, and we fully understand that this has caused distress for them and their families."" They added: ""We took this difficult decision as a last resort and only after full consideration of all other options but, ultimately, we concluded that the business wouldn't survive without fundamentally changed crewing arrangements, which in turn would inevitably result in redundancies."" P&O Ferries is one of the UK's leading ferry companies, carrying more than 10 million passengers a year before the pandemic and about 15% of all freight cargo in and out of the UK. It was bought by DP World, the multi-national ports and logistics company based in Dubai in 2019. At the time of purchase, its chairman Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem described it as a ""strong, recognisable brand"". It paid a Â£270m dividend to shareholders in 2020. However, like many transport operators, it saw demand slump in the pandemic. Just a couple of months after the dividends announcement, it said it would cut 1,100 jobs after a downturn in bookings. On Friday, it confirmed it is losing about Â£1m a day for each day its services are not running. Are you affected by issues covered in this story? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

"This video can not be played WATCH: The BBC's Quentin Sommerville follows Ukrainian troops holding the front line as Russia pounds Kharkiv Ukraine's second city Kharkiv has been the constant target of Russian attacks for three weeks. The BBC's Quentin Sommerville and cameraman Darren Conway report from the front line where Ukrainian troops continue to repel the enemy advance. We enter the house where the back door used to be. Now there is just a blanket flapping in the freezing wind. The owners, long gone, would have had a view across the rich farmland north of Kharkiv, but much of that is unrecognisable, too. In the garage, beside an abandoned skateboard, are a dozen or so empty packing cases for some of the world's best anti-tank weapons. A dead Russian soldier lies face down in the front garden. The house has become a frontline base, and the spent cases are an indication that the soldiers here have had the fight of their lives - a fight for Ukraine's independence. We have gained rare access to the Ukrainian army, who after three weeks of hard fighting, are still holding firm on the outskirts of Kharkiv, preventing Russian forces from capturing Ukraine's second-largest city. ""Do you want to go further ahead?"" asks Yuri, a commander with the Ukrainian army's 22 Motorized Infantry Battalion, pointing at the ruins of two Russian armoured personnel carriers, and the shattered pieces of two of their tanks. The battalion was reconstituted in 2014 after Russia invaded Crimea and backed Donbas separatists. ""They've used drones, aircraft, attack helicopters, everything,"" says Yuri, as Russian shells thunder overhead, striking nearby roads and apartment blocks. Moments after Russian Grad rockets - multiple rockets launched in quick succession - fell on a residential neighbourhood The Russians have continued to attack again and been repelled many times. In their frustration at being denied entry, they bomb the city, which was once home to 1.4 million people, day and night. The ground is churned up and thick mud sucks on your boots. A backward glance shows the ruined shells of the line of houses we just passed through. Suburban gardens have become battlefields from Europe's past. ""The first three days were the worst. It was raining, we were covered in mud, we looked like pigs,"" says Olexander, 44, who is standing nearby. By one of the destroyed armoured personnel carriers, its Z marking already faded, is a large crater, 20ft (6m) across. On the first day of the invasion, 24 February, a Russian strike killed six Ukrainian soldiers at this exact place. Many more died here since, but official figures aren't being released. A green army boot is perched on the crater's edge, a Russian corpse beyond that. A large black crow sits nearby, untroubled by the roar of shelling and Grad rockets from Russian positions. The men here can tell you the precise date and time they came to the front - the implication being that if you weren't here the first three days, you don't know real fighting. ""Jump in the crater if there is more shelling,"" says Uri. Constantine, 58, was a pilot in the Ukrainian air force until he retired and became a journalist. Now he's back at the front, walking with a limp and using a broken broom handle for support. Russian shrapnel wounded his leg, but he refuses to leave the front. ""This is the last line of defence for the city, if they get through here, they will enter Kharkiv. This road takes you from Russia to the very heart of the city,"" he says. Olexander, 44, who fought in Donbas - ""For the first three days, we couldn't understand what was going on"" There is a boom and whoosh, and a wire-guided missile flies just over our heads. We scramble into the crater. It strikes along the roadside, a gas pipeline bursts into flames. While we shelter, a tall reconnaissance soldier with blue tape across his helmet tells us to stay down. Roman is 34 years old, though he jokes that he was 24 when the war started three weeks ago. He says the Russians won't show themselves now. ""They are chickens. We will respond good and proper."" He stops and asks for a selfie. Later we learn that he transported the dead bodies of his fallen comrades in his own vehicle - which was just a month old - from the front to the city morgue. As we leave, Constantine catches something in the air - thin copper wire, which stretches for miles. It was used to guide the Russian missile which just flew over our heads. Waiting for us is Olexander, 44, from nearby Poltava region. He's been with the unit since its founding and has fought in Donbas. ""This is much worse,"" he says, adding: ""For the first three days, we couldn't understand what was going on. We were lost and we couldn't believe it was happening. But after that we got better and we are standing our ground and will hold our positions."" I ask him why he is fighting. He gives a laugh and responds, ""For a free Ukraine, for my family, and for you guys as well. For our independence and for peace."" Yuri, the commander, drives us back to the collection of Soviet-era apartment blocks, still inhabited. Russia says it came to Ukraine to demilitarise the country, but here we see what that means for civilians. A 20-storey block is still smoking from a Russian strike - it was two days ago, according to Yuri. The official number of civilian deaths in Kharkiv stood at 234, including 14 children, on 16 March. The past few days have been punishing - as we were reminded in an instant. A volley of Russian Grad rockets rained down on the neighbourhood, striking just metres away. The soldiers around us had taken cover and were unharmed. Svitlana. 72, and her husband sleep two hours a night in their bomb-damaged flat In the same housing complex lives husband and wife Svitlana and Sasha. Svitlana is 72, and welcomes us into her home, saying they haven't spoken to anyone in weeks. ""We're glad you came,"" she says. Their building has already been hit, the back windows are gone, and they sleep in a central room on sofas. They manage two hours of sleep a night, the shelling is relentless. ""When it stops, it is like a thaw in spring,"" she says. I ask if she has a message for Vladimir Putin. ""No,"" she replies, firmly. ""No, it seems to me that this man has already lost his sanity and he does not think clearly. Because a sane human can not do something like this - bomb old people, kids, kindergartens, schools, hospitals. He wouldn't understand what I say."" But then, when I ask about the men not far from her home who are defending the city, she cries. She says, ""Yes, I'm very grateful to them for protecting their homeland. Hold on guys. We will always support you. They are so brave, both boys and girls."" There are still hundreds of thousands of people living in Kharkiv, despite the shelling. If Russia and Ukraine are brothers, as the Kremlin professes, then this is fratricide. As we leave the neighbourhood, much of it is alight. Russia's fury with this city is both seen and heard. By evening, all of Kharkiv is covered in a cloud of smoke, the relentless pounding of guns continues, but the defenders of Kharkiv still keep the enemy from the city gates.

"This video can not be played P&O Ferries workers were told via video that it ""was their final day of employment"" P&O Ferries has sparked outrage after sacking 800 staff with plans to replace them with cheaper agency workers. Staff were told in a video call that Thursday was their ""final day of employment"", but some refused to leave their ships in protest and were removed. P&O said it was a ""tough"" decision but it would ""not be a viable business"" without the changes. But the government called the workers' treatment ""wholly unacceptable"". And the RMT union is threatening legal action against the ferry company, calling it one of the ""most shameful acts in the history of British industrial relations"". Further protests on Friday are being organised in Dover, Liverpool and Hull. ""Reports of workers being given zero notice and escorted off their ships... shows the insensitive way in which P&O have approached this issue,"" said Robert Courts, parliamentary under secretary for transport. ""I am extremely concerned and frankly angry at the way workers have been treated by P&O."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Courts said the company had told him it will be suspending services for ""a week to 10 days while they locate new crew"" on the Dover to Calais, Larne to Cairnryan, Dublin to Liverpool and Hull to Rotterdam routes. On Friday morning, the company again said on Twitter it would not run services ""for the next few days"". Meanwhile, the Department for Transport says neither the Secretary of State, Grant Shapps, nor Mr Courts, was aware of what was happening with P&O until Thursday. This video can not be played Sacked P&O employee Andrew Smith said he felt ""utter dismay"" at losing his job after 22 years' service The BBC has seen details of a contract for handcuff-trained security professionals which began two days before they were deployed to Dover to remove staff from ferries. TUC General Secretary Frances O'Grady said P&O's ""secret plan"" to sack staff with no notice was ""reprehensible"". P&O passengers were told to use DFDS while services were suspended. RMT union members blocked traffic in Dover on Thursday in response to the 800 redundancies announced by P&O Ferries Crew on one ship docked at Larne Harbour in Northern Ireland had lifted the gangway after private security officers arrived to remove them. The crew has now left the ship and Gary Jackson, a full time officer and RMT union member onboard the Pride of Hull, said they were ""absolutely devastated"". 'We've been abandoned by P&O' say sacked staff ""At 11am ratings and officers were informed there was going to be a pre-recorded Zoom meeting. After that two to three-minute call all the crew were made redundant,"" he said. ""I've seen grown men crying on there because they don't know where they're going to go from today."" This video can not be played Robert Courts says he is ""frankly angry"" at the way P&O Ferries staff have been treated James, who has worked for P&O Ferries in Dover for around four years, said he felt abandoned by the company after all he received ""was a three minute pre-recorded message saying we are out of a job. Nothing else."" ""It was a complete surprise. I would have understood if it was at the height of Covid, but now we're seeing the end of travel restrictions and the start of summer bookings. So this has come completely out of the blue,"" he said. Mark Canet-Baldwin, from Hull, was one of the agency workers brought to Cairnryan to take over from the crew that were being sacked. But after talking it through with his wife, he said: ""I felt I can't do it. I felt sick to my stomach. And I walked off. Two others came with me. It's just wrong."" P&O Ferries are currently suspended Workers are reported to have been escorted off their ships while being told that cheaper alternatives will take up their roles. ""The approach adopted by P&O is not unheard of, but it is exceptional to forego appropriate notice and consultation processes,"" said Nathan Donaldson, employment solicitor at Keystone Law. He said a government review of firing and rehiring in November 2021 did not outlaw the practice but emphasised ""that it should be a process of last resort"". Rustom Tata, chairman and head of the employment group at law firm DMH Stallard, said P&O's actions would affect the brand's reputation due to the ""apparently wholly planned approach being taken to such a large proportion of its workforce ignoring some of the basic fundamentals of employee relations."" Ann Francke, chief executive of The Chartered Management Institute, said P&O had ""got it very wrong"". ""It's shocking and appalling. It's like management behaviour from another era,"" she said. P&O said its survival was dependent on ""making swift and significant changes now"". ""We have made a Â£100m loss year on year, which has been covered by our parent DP World. This is not sustainable. Without these changes there is no future for P&O Ferries."" The cross-Channel operator said on Twitter that sailings between Dover and Calais scheduled for Thursday will no longer run, and customers with tickets were instructed to sail with rival ferry company DFDS. P&O Ferries is one of the UK's leading ferry companies, carrying more than 10 million passengers a year before the pandemic and about 15% of all freight cargo in and out of the UK. However, like many transport operators it saw demand slump in the pandemic. The firm claimed almost Â£15m in government grants in 2020, which included furlough payments for its employees. P&O is owned by DP World, the multi-national ports and logistics company based in Dubai. It paid a Â£270m dividend to shareholders in 2020. Diane Riley has travelled to Rotterdam for a Northern Soul event Diane Riley has travelled with a friend from Hull to Rotterdam with P&O for a Northern Soul event. She was on a day trip to Amsterdam on Thursday when she heard from her daughter in the UK that P&O had suspended its services. ""It was a shock,"" says Diane, adding: ""I thought she was joking at first."" She got a text from the company at around 4pm, advising her to return to the ferry to spend the night. She says passengers have been told they may be put on a DFDS ferry to Newcastle on Friday morning, and will then be taken back to Hull by coach. ""We don't know anything for certain - we'll have to wait and see what happens when we get back to the ferry,"" she says. Meanwhile, Lauren Shaw and her husband told the BBC they were booked with P&O to travel on a ferry from Cairnryan to Larne at 4pm on Thursday. ""We had a phone call at 10am to tell us there would be no sailings today and that they hadn't been told a reason why,"" she said. They travelled to the port in the hope getting a ferry, but said: ""It's really frustrating."" Are you affected by issues covered in this story? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

"Higher oil prices are set to lead to a 10% increase in air fares, according to the boss of one of the world's biggest airlines. Delta Air Lines head Ed Bastian told the BBC the final impact ""really depends where fuel prices settle"". Oil prices have reached 14-year highs after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Emirates, Japan Airlines and AirAsia are among the big carriers to introduce surcharges on their tickets recently to cover the higher cost of jet fuel. Before the pandemic, in 2019, 200 million customers flew on Delta, making it the world's second biggest airline by passenger numbers. Mr Bastian said that on a domestic US flight the rise in fuel prices ""is probably about $25 on a ticket, that could be anywhere between 5% to 10% at these high levels of oil... and international [flights] will be a bit higher than that"". Delta is planning to introduce fuel surcharges on the international flights which account for about 35% of its business, and increase US ticket prices. Oil price rises due to fears over Russian shortfall How has Ukraine conflict affected petrol prices? How do we replace Russian energy? Jet fuel is one of the biggest costs for airlines. Michael O'Leary, the boss of Europe's biggest carrier Ryanair, said recently that the surge in oil prices would lead to""materially higher"" airfares this summer. Many airlines try to protect themselves from these changes by buying fuel in advance. Easyjet and British Airways both said recently that they had done so for 60% of their fuel needs this year. Delta chief Ed Bastian says higher oil prices will mean more expensive airfares This year has seen big fluctuations. At the start of January, Brent crude - the international benchmark for oil - was under $80 a barrel, but it recently reached as high as almost $130 as theUS and UK said they would end their useof oil from the world's biggest exporter, Russia. More price swings are likely in the short-term according to the executive director of the International Energy Agency, Dr Fatih Birol. He told the BBC: ""I think the $100 [oil] we are experiencing today may not be the highest level of prices we'll be seeing in the next weeks"". He warns that will be felt across all areas of the global economy, because as well as higher transport costs it will lead to more expensive heating and electricity. That would exacerbate the cost of living crisis many countries are facing. ""Every single dollar for oil going to [the] Russian economy will go back as a tank or as a bullet to Ukrainian people"", says IEA Executive Director Dr Fatih Birol Reports from India suggest it is considering tackling high prices at the petrol pumps by buying discounted Russian oil. Many won't purchase it because of western sanctions, and Dr Birol warned: ""One shouldn't forget that every single dollar for oil going to [the] Russian economy will go back as a tank or as a bullet to Ukrainian people. One shouldn't forget this moral aspect in my view"". Instead he wants Middle Eastern countries including Saudi Arabia to increase oil production. The latest IEA forecast says three million barrels a day of Russian oil could be removed from the market. However, that drop in supply could be offset by a fall in demand from China whereCovid has led to new lockdowns.

""Sometimes you win, and often you lose."" Instead Delta has the protection of owning its oil refinery in Pennsylvania, although it has been unsuccessful in recent efforts to try to sell it. ""We're thrilled that we have it right now"" says Mr Bastian. Delta's ownership of this oil refinery in Trainer, Pennsylvania gives it some protection from volatile prices The Delta chief is also looking to a future where initiatives to tackle climate change bycutting aviation's carbon emissionsmean oil prices are less of a concern. ""The existing fossil fuel and jet fuel technology needs to go, and we need to make those investments for the future towards a sustainable future."" This means moving towards sustainable fuels such as biofuels or synthetic alternatives made through chemical processes. Mr Bastian says that cost is the big impediment, with the production of such substitutes costing ""three to five times what's in the marketplace today"". The difference will need to be made by governments investing in scaling up production. ""Scale will bring costs down over time, and will bring more capital from private sources into exploration and looking for new technology. This next five years is critical that to make sure we get government support, not just in the US but around the world."" Returning to profitability after the losses of the pandemic will also help fund the development of new technologies. According to the International Air Transport Association the industry lostmore than $51bn last year,externalwith global demand 58.4% down on 2019 levels. Passengers are returning to the skies as Covid restrictions ease, but Asia is seeing a slower recovery than other regions As Covid restrictions continue to ease, Delta had two record days of sales last week, leading Mr Bastian to be hopeful about the outlook. ""The world is returning to travel and governments have decided that Covid is done."" ""We're seeing some of our largest bookings we've ever had in our history. And it's not just in the US, it's internationally as well."" However, he adds that Asia is lagging behind other regions. AirAsia boss calls on governments to open borders Air fare rises are unavoidable, warns airline boss Coronavirus: Boeing says air travel to recover by 2024 Crucially demand for lucrative business class fares is also returning. It is currently at about 60% of pre-pandemic levels, but Mr Bastian expects this to rise to 70% by the summer. He concedes ""there's forms of business travel that will never return, that are more efficient to handle over video technology"", but adds that leisure travellers are now showing more willingness to splash out on premium services. Last year Delta recorded a pre-tax loss of $3.4bn and thedisruption caused by coronavirusat the start of this year means Mr Bastian thinks that will be added to at the start of this year. ""We will lose some money primarily because of Omicron, it's not fuel prices. But I do expect starting in the second quarter and beyond that we'll be profitable.""

"Burger King has 800 stores in Russia The owner of Burger King said the operator of its 800 stores in Russia has ""refused"" to close the sites despite demands to suspend trading. Restaurant Brands said it had contacted local partner, Alexander Kolobov, to shut the shops amid the war in Ukraine. But it said ""complicated"" contracts with overseas partners mean it is unable to ""walk away"" from these deals. Mr Kolobov told the BBC he does not have the ""authority or power"" to stop Burger King operations in Russia. But he said any closure must be approved by all investors in the business. ""The decision to terminate and suspend operations of the franchisee which employs about 25,000 persons must be taken by all shareholders considering impact it may have on the employees and their families,"" he said. Many Western firms have shut or suspended their Russian businesses because of the country's invasion of Ukraine. However a small number, including Burger King and UK retailer Marks and Spencer (M&S), have been unable to do so because their stores are run by franchise partners under ""complex"" legal arrangements. The Western brands unable to leave Russia Growing numbers of firms pull back from Russia In a letter to staff,external, Restaurant Brands International president David Shear said: ""We contacted the main operator of the business and demanded the suspension of Burger King restaurant operations in Russia. ""He has refused to do so."" Mr Shear added that making any changes to its local Burger King business ""would ultimately require the support of Russian authorities on the ground and we know that will not practically happen anytime soon"". Burger King entered the Russian market 10 years ago. It trades there through a joint venture partnership with Mr Kolobov - who is the main day-to-day operator of the business - as well as with Russia's VTB Capital and a Ukrainian investment firm. VTB Capital is an affiliate of VTB Bank, Russia's second largest financial institution which has been sanctioned by the US, UK and other European countries. Mr Kolobov said he owns a 30% stake in the joint venture.""Since the date of the establishment (of) the joint venture-franchisee... my share has always been far below control,"" he said. Mr Shear said Restaurant Brands owns a minority stake of 15% in the Russian joint venture which it is in the process of unwinding. ""While we would like to do this immediately, it is clear that it will take some time to do so based on the terms of our existing joint venture agreement,"" he said. Restaurant Brands has stopped supporting the supply chain, operations and marketing for Russia. It will also reject new pitches for investment and expansion in Russia. Western companies remain under pressure to withdraw from Russia following its attack on Ukraine. On Thursday, a group of four Ukrainian MPs highlighted to UK prime minister Boris Johnson that M&S is still open in Russia. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

MP Alona Shkrum said: ""It is very important to put Putin in isolation and for him to know he will not be getting a handshake from the world, he will not be getting a handshake from business, there will be no support for him because he has killed children in Ukraine."" Complex franchise agreements have prevented some Western brands from shutting their stores in Russia. They have, however, publicly shunned the country over its invasion of Ukraine. Marks & Spencer stores are operated by a Turkish company called FiBA, which has held the rights to sell the retailer's products across Eastern Europe, since 1999. M&S said it has suspended shipments of its goods to FiBA which runs Marks' 48 stores in Russia. Meanwhile, German carmaker Audi has warned that the war in Ukraine will cause ""tremendous interference"" to supply chains. ""We will see tremendous interference with all the supply chains, not just the chip business, but any supply chains internationally,"" said Audi executive Hildegard Wortmann.
