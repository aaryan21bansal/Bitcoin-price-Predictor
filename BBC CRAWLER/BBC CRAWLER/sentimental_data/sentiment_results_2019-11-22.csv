"This video can not be played Corbyn: ""I will adopt a neutral stance on Brexit"" Jeremy Corbyn has said he would remain neutral in a future Brexit referendum if Labour wins power. He told a BBC Question Time leaders' special he would not campaign for Leave or Remain so it would allow him, as prime minister, to ""credibly"" carry out what the voters then decide. Prime Minister Boris Johnson later asked how Mr Corbyn could be ""indifferent"" on such a vital issue. But Mr Johnson faced questions of his own about whether he could be trusted. The prime minister was the fourth party leader to answer the audience's questions, with the SNP's Nicola Sturgeon and Liberal Democrat Jo Swinson also taking to the stage for 30 minutes each on Friday evening. Pressed on whether politicians should be relied upon to tell the truth, Mr Johnson said this was ""absolutely vital"". While trust was a crucial issue for voters, he argued the biggest threat to public confidence was the ""corrosive"" effect of Parliament trying to block Brexit. Fact-checking the leaders' debate Kuenssberg: No comfortable ride for the party leaders Five standout moments Live: Reaction to Question Time special He said the Labour, SNP and Lib Dem leaders wanted to ""basically frustrate"" the result of the 2016 referendum, which the public had been waiting more than three years to see delivered, by ""absurdly"" holding another one. He said that the Labour leader's views seemed to have ""mutated"" and Mr Corbyn's ambition to negotiate an improved agreement would be totally undermined if he did not care whether the public backed it or not. ""He is now going to be neutral on the deal he proposes to do. I don't see how he can do a deal when he is going to be neutral or indifferent."" This video can not be played Watch highlights from the Question Time leaders' special The four leaders all appeared individually and faced a mixture of audience questions and follow-up questions from host Fiona Bruce at the event in Sheffield. The first to take the stage, Mr Corbyn, faced tough questioning about his economic polices, with one member of the audience suggesting his ""reckless socialist"" agenda ""terrified"" him and his family. The Labour leader said his plans to take Royal Mail, the railways, the water industry and broadband delivery into public ownership had been ""set out"" very clearly and were aimed at ""delivering an economy that works for all"". He insisted business had ""nothing to be frightened of"" by his plans, saying his ""fully prepared and costed manifesto"" would bring the country together and help reduce inequality. Mr Corbyn was criticised for what several audience members suggested was a lack of clarity on whether he personally would support or oppose Brexit in a new referendum in 2020, with one questioner saying: ""Why would anyone vote for Labour without knowing the answer to that question?"" Mr Corbyn said it was ""entirely reasonable"" to put the question back to the people as another referendum represented a sensible middle ground between those who wanted to cancel Brexit entirely and those backing the PM's deal. Asked to clarify his own position, he said: ""I will adopt, if I am prime minister at the time, a neutral stance so I can credibly carry out the results of that to bring our communities and countries together rather than continuing an endless debate."" He later told the audience: ""You heard it here first on Question Time."" REALITY CHECK:Leaders' claims scrutinised VIDEO:The best bits, in three minutes FIVE MOMENTS:The key takeaways ANALYSIS:Laura Kuenssberg's take TWITTER REACTION:Audience gains social media respect In doing this, he would follow in the footsteps of Harold Wilson - who allowed Labour ministers to campaign on both sides in the 1975 Common Market referendum and took a back seat during the campaign - although he personally backed staying in. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Health Secretary Matt Hancock attacked Mr Corbyn's position, saying he had ""decided to be indecisive"" and it ""won't wash with the voters"". But shadow employment rights secretary Laura Pidcock defended Mr Corbyn's stance as ""brave"". ""What we are saying is we trust the people to have the final say,"" she told Today. It's not clear if the lively grilling of major politicians will shift the dial at this election. But it certainly marked a shift in Jeremy Corbyn's position on Brexit. He had been put under pressure by his opponents to say whether he would support Leave or Remain in the new referendum Labour is promising. So he tried to eliminate a negative by providing clarity, of a sort: a clear commitment to stay neutral. Labour's strategists are suggesting he could now be seen as an honest broker that can bring a divided country together. In truth, though, behind the scenes there are fears that the party may have over-estimated the threat from the Lib Dems and underestimated the importance voters in Leave areas attach to delivering Brexit. So his neutrality is in part an attempt to reassure those voters that his promised referendum isn't the means of cancelling Brexit by the back door. His followers will say he has risen above the fray; his critics - that he has become more decisive about sitting on the fence. Questioned on the issue of tackling incidents of anti-Semitism in the Labour Party, Mr Corbyn was accused of failing to intervene when one of his own Jewish MPs, Ruth Smeeth, was heckled by an activist at a party event in 2016. Mr Corbyn said Ms Smeeth and others had ""suffered terrible abuse"". He insisted that all forms of racism and misogyny were ""unacceptable"" and party activists who had abused MPs had been disciplined or expelled. When Mr Johnson took the stage, he dismissed suggestions he was trying to suppress the findings of a report into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 referendum vote as ""Bermuda triangle stuff"". ""There is no evidence whatsoever, that I know of, to show any interference in any British electoral event,"" the Conservative leader said. He insisted his party had ""zero tolerance"" towards Islamophobia and said he regretted any offence he had caused in articles about race during his journalistic career - including a piece in 2018 in which he likened Muslim women wearing burqas to letter boxes and bank robbers. But he defended the right to freedom of speech and did not accept an audience member's invitation to say ""sorry"" for writing them. Labour's economic plans would be ""ruinous"" for the country, he argued, but he also acknowledged his plan to cut national insurance bills for low-earners - expected to be the main tax announcement in the Conservative manifesto - would only have a modest impact. On the NHS, Mr Johnson stuck by his claims that the health service was receiving the biggest cash injection in its history. He added: ""Of course I understand that things have been tough in the NHS and understand the pressures the NHS is under. I know the massive demand the NHS faces but we can only meet that demand if we have a dynamic economy."" The SNP's Nicola Sturgeon said voting for her party in Scotland was the best way of ""depriving"" the Tories of a majority across the UK. Asked about what she would do in the event of another hung Parliament on 12 December, she said she would not work with the Tories but was prepared to deal with Labour if Jeremy Corbyn committed to end austerity and agreed to hold another Scottish independence referendum. This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon challenged over Scottish independence plans ""In terms of what I would seek to win from a minority Labour government, obviously I would ask for and expect Jeremy Corbyn to respect the right of the Scottish people to choose their own future. ""It is not for Westminster to decide. It is for the people of Scotland."" When it was pointed out to her that Mr Corbyn had just stated to viewers that he would not sanction another independence referendum in the first two years of a Labour government, she said she was predicting what he might choose to do after the election, rather than dwelling on what he was saying now. She said: ""Do you think he's going to walk away from the chance to end austerity, to protect the NHS, stop Universal Credit, simply because he wants, for a couple of years, to prevent Scotland having the right to self-determination?"" The first minister said more needed to be done to reduce the number of drug deaths in Scotland, saying, ""I don't want to be citizen of a country where people are dying from drug issues."" Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson was immediately asked by an audience member whether she regretted saying she could become prime minister and ""how ridiculous this sounded"" - given that her party only had 20 MPs at the end of the last Parliament. She said she recognised it was a ""big ask"" for her to make it to No 10 but she believed many people were ""dismayed"" at having to choose between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn and there had to be a ""better alternative"". This video can not be played Jo Swinson: Lib Dems 'being very straightforward' on Brexit She faced awkward questions over her plans to cancel Brexit by revoking Article 50, being asked by one audience member whether she regarded all 17.4 million Leave voters as ""stupid"". Ms Swinson said this was not the case and they clearly disagreed over the benefits of being in the EU, to which she was told ""you can disagree with me but you lost"". She was also challenged over austerity and what one audience member called her party's backing for ""harsh and cruel benefit cuts"" while in coalition with the Conservatives between 2010 and 2015. She conceded the Lib Dems had made mistakes during their time in government and should have done more to limit the scale of austerity - although she said she remained supportive of the principle of the Universal Credit system - which Labour has pledged to scrap. It was not a comfortable ride for any of the four who appeared in front of the audience in Sheffield who were pressed on issues as broad as the economy, austerity, Brexit, Bolivia, the Russia report, racism, the NHS and plenty more. It was particularly uncomfortable for the Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, who was pummelled by the audience over her promise to stop Brexit by simply halting the process altogether in the unlikely event she won a majority. There were moments of real challenge too for Boris Johnson first on a very simple question - can he be trusted? The audience's attitude made it clear they have a big question about that, and about him. Read more from Laura here.

"This video can not be played This week's impeachment hearings in three minutes President Donald Trump has pilloried an envoy who testified in the impeachment inquiry, claiming she refused to hang his photo in the US embassy in Ukraine. Mr Trump told Fox News' morning show former ambassador Marie Yovanovitch ""didn't want to hang my picture in the embassy"" in Kyiv. The president did not offer further details about the matter. Ms Yovanovitch testified last week that she was fired over ""false claims"" by people with ""questionable motives"". She was one of 12 witnesses to testify over the last fortnight in the impeachment inquiry, which may seek to remove the president from office for alleged corruption. In a phone call to Fox and Friends on Friday morning, Mr Trump defended the removal of Ms Yovanovitch. ""This ambassador, who everybody says was so wonderful,"" Mr Trump said, ""she wouldn't hang my picture in the embassy. ""She's in charge of the embassy, it took, like, a year and a half, two years."" Mr Trump added: ""She said bad things about me, she wouldn't defend me, and I have the right to change the ambassador. ""The standard is you put the president of the United States' picture in the embassy,"" he continued. ""This was not an angel, this woman, OK?"" This video can not be played Trump's live-tweets ""very intimidating"" - Yovanovitch It was not the first time the Republican president has attacked Ms Yovanovitch. Helambasted her in a tweetwhile she was testifying last Friday - a move that Democrats argued amounted to witness intimidation. The 33-year veteran of the foreign service was recalled as the American ambassador to Kyiv in May for reasons that remain murky. She testified that her anti-corruption efforts had incurred the ire of influential Ukrainians who sought to remove her. Ms Yovanovitch said she was shocked that her enemies appeared to find allies in the Trump administration, including the president's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani. The former envoy's supporters say she was also smeared by US conservative media voices. In her testimony, Ms Yovanovitch said the allegation she was disloyal to Mr Trump was false. The US president is accused of withholding US military aid to pressure Ukraine into investigating his domestic political rival. At the heart of the impeachment inquiry is a phone call on 25 July this year between Mr Trump and Ukraine's newly elected president. This video can not be played Sondland was involved in a ""domestic political errand"" for Trump On the call, Mr Trump urged his counterpart to look into unsubstantiated corruption claims against Democratic White House contender Joe Biden. Mr Trump's critics say this alleged political pressure on a vulnerable US ally amounted to abuse of power. UK coal miner's daughter turned White House aide The president spent a significant portion of Friday's television interview discussing a conspiracy theory that it was Ukraine - not Russia - meddling in the US 2016 presidential election. These claims were branded ""a fictional narrative"" by one of Thursday's impeachment witnesses, former White House intelligence official and Russia expert Fiona Hill. She warned elected officials not to promote ""politically driven falsehoods"" that seek to cast doubt on Russia's alleged interference in US elections. Three Republican impeachment claims, fact-checked For almost an hour on Fox News, Donald Trump shared conspiracy theories about Ukrainian meddling in the 2016 US presidential election, again attacked a decorated former US ambassador and suggested a foreign service officer at the US embassy in Ukraine was lying under oath. And those were just the bullet-point highlights. It was yet further evidence that the president's take diverges entirely from the testimony of witnesses in the public impeachment hearings and the accounts reported in the mainstream US media. Mr Trump, for instance, was adamant that a 26 July phone call between himself and Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the EU who was in Kiev at the time, ""never took place"". It was during this call - confirmed by Mr Sondland himself - that witness David Holmes testified on Thursday that the president asked about Ukrainian ""investigations"" the day after Mr Trump had told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Democratic rival Joe Biden. Critics will pick apart the president's comments, but if there's one thing clear after nearly three years of this presidency, when Mr Trump asserts his defence repeatedly and vociferously, his supporters and the Republican party back him up, no matter what fact-checkers may say. After sprinting through seven public hearings with 12 witnesses over five days, the House of Representatives' Intelligence Committee is now writing a report to submit to the Judiciary Committee. The Judiciary Committee is expected to begin drafting articles of impeachment - which are the charges of wrongdoing against the president - in early December. After a vote in the Democratic-controlled House, a trial would be held in the Republican-run Senate. If Mr Trump was convicted by a two-thirds majority - an outcome deemed highly unlikely - he would become the first US president to be removed from office through impeachment. The White House and some Republicans want the trial to be limited to two weeks.

"Twenty-two people were killed in the attack on 22 May 2017 Greater Manchester Police (GMP) has been accused of jeopardising the start of the public inquiry into the Manchester Arena bomb attack. The force was criticised for missing a deadline to provide statements from officers in command on the night of the May 2017 blast in which 22 people died. ""It has been a huge undertaking for GMP involving an enormous amount of material,"" said the force's barrister. The inquiry is due to begin on 6 April 2020. Twenty two people were killed and hundreds injured when a device was detonated at the end of an Ariana Grande concert on 22 May, 2017. The victims' inquests wereturned into a public inquiry in Octoberso that secret evidence could be heard behind closed doors. Paul Greaney QC, counsel to the inquiry, told the hearing there was a second problem with ""gaps"" in the 550 hours of radio transmission recordings from the night of the bombing provided by GMP. Twelve organisations have been asked to provide written statements to the inquiry's legal team. GMP was said to be the only one not to have met the deadline. Peter Weatherby QC, who is representing some of the bereaved families, said that they desperately wanted to have confidence in GMP but ""the sorry tale is frankly not good enough"". The chairman of the inquiry, Sir John Saunders, warned the police that if there was a delay to the inquiry there would be ""extremely extensive public criticism made of GMP"". He said it was ""simply not fair to the families or to Manchester in general"" but added ""no comments should be made about lack of candour until we see the statements."" Fiona Barton QC, representing GMP, apologised to families in court for the delay. One relative was heard to say that he did not accept the apology. ""This is not a piece of work GMP has sat on,"" she said. ""It's been a huge undertaking for GMP involving an enormous amount of material. GMP has done its best."" Ms Barton explained the statements had been delayed because the force had hundreds of officers on duty at the attack, and it had taken time to identify which ones should provide the evidence. She said they were now in the process of being provided. In relation to the missing radio recordings she explained that the force was undergoing a system update at the time of the bombing, and work was under way to find the audio.

"This video can not be played Jeane Freeman explains why health board is in ""special measures"" Glasgow's health board has been placed in ""special measures"" following the deaths of two children at the city's largest hospital. Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde would be escalated to stage four of the NHS Board Performance Escalation Framework. This means an oversight board will be put in place, chaired by chief nursing officer Prof Fiona McQueen. Ms Freeman said there were issues over infection prevention and control. The move was welcomed by opposition MSPs who had been calling for the government to take greater control of the board. Earlier this week Ms Freeman apologised to the parents of two patients who died in 2017 in the Royal Hospital for Children (RHC), which is part of the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital (QEUH) campus. The five-step process to keep Scotland's NHS boards in line Mother of hospital death boy: 'I've been ignored' Health secretary issues apology over child deaths In a letter to the Scottish Parliament's health and sport committee on Friday, she said there were ""ongoing issues"" over infection prevention, management and control at the hospitals. ""I have concluded that further action is necessary to support the board to ensure appropriate governance is in place to increase public confidence in these matters and therefore that for this specific issue the board will be escalated to stage four of our performance framework,"" she said. A stage four ranking means there are ""significant risks to delivery, quality, financial performance or safety"" and that senior level external support is required. In her letter, Ms Freeman said the escalation would ""ensure appropriate governance is in place to increase public confidence and strengthen current approaches that are in place to mitigate avoidable harms"". There will be specific support for infection prevention and control, communications and engagement. When asked whether she had lost confidence in the health board, Ms Freeman told BBC Scotland it was ""performing well"" in a number of areas. She said: ""In their clinical performance they provide excellent quality of care to patients across their area. ""But in this particular area of infection prevention and control and how they manage that, how they have governance around that, how they collect and use the data and in their engagement with patients and families - and by that I mean giving people the answers to their questions - there is significant room for improvement."" Scottish Labour MSP Anas Sarwar said the health secretary had taken the right course of action. ""The Glasgow health board is not fit for purpose, and this is a necessary step following the unforgiveable failings of senior management,"" he said. ""The focus now must be to tell parents, patients and the public the truth about infections at the hospital. ""I pay tribute to the brave whistleblowers who came forward to shine a light on the catastrophic failings in the hope that nothing like this can ever happen again."" The Queen Elizabeth University Hospital and the Royal Hospital for Children share a campus in the south of Glasgow The health boardand Ms Freeman have both apologised to the parents of two children who died at the hospital. Three-year-old Mason Djemat, who was being treated for a rare genetic disease, died on 9 August 2017. Milly Main, 10, died three weeks later while recovering from leukaemia treatment. Both children were treated on a ward affected by water contamination at the Royal Hospital for Children. Their deaths emerged after Mr Sarwar was contacted by a whistleblower. It also emerged on Friday that the NHS board has written to parents confirming that one of the wards affected will reopen for general admissions. It explained there was ""no evidence to support the continued restriction of new admissions"" in the ward, and that new parent and staff facilities would be provided.

"This video can not be played Eastbourne's Claremont Hotel severely damaged by fire A Victorian seafront hotel has been ""engulfed in flames"" after a fire broke out in its basement. Eastbourne's Grade II* listed Claremont Hotel was evacuated after the blaze started at about 08:50 GMT. The Pier Hotel has also been evacuated. About 60 firefighters and 12 engines were sent to the scene. Six people have been treated for minor injuries, with one taken to hospital suffering from breathing difficulties, the ambulance service said. All those who were in the hotel when the fire started have been accounted for, East Sussex Fire and Rescue Service said. The fire at Claremont hotel started at about 08:50 GMT Nearby residents have been advised to keep windows and doors closed. Roads in the area have been shut. Flames spread from the basement of the Claremont and could be seen coming out of windows and the roof. ""The building has been seriously damaged and will need to be examined by building experts before a decision is made about its future,"" a fire service spokesman said. He said the fire had been brought under control and the fire service was ""scaling back the operation"". The owners of the hotel, Daish's Holidays, said the ""significant damage"" to the hotel was ""devastating"". The company said 130 guests and staff members had been in the building when the fire broke out. A spokesman said the hotel had arranged return travel home for all guests and was contacting guests who had future bookings. ""We are devastated at the loss of the hotel and will be working tirelessly to support everyone affected by the damage."" The fire service said the blaze took hold ""very quickly"" Simon Palmer, who works at the neighbouring Pier Hotel, said the Claremont was ""engulfed in flames"" and added the fire had ""taken three-quarters of the roof away already"". He said he heard a ""very loud explosion"" and thought parts of the hotel were collapsing. Many of the guests he had spoken to were having breakfast when the blaze started so were able to escape quickly, he said. Plumes of smoke have been seen coming from the building East Sussex Fire and Rescue Service said it was using seawater to deal with the fire Drug-drivers facing renewed Christmas crackdown 'My parents were told to plan my funeral' Lorry full of chocolate bursts into flames Guests Jenny and Alan Powell, from Cheltenham, in Gloucestershire, described ""a massive explosion"".

"The woman managed to give the dispatcher her address and answer questions by pretending to order a pizza (file picture) A woman in a domestic violence situation managed to call 911 without the perpetrator realising, by pretending to order a pizza. Officers in Oregon city, Ohio, praised the caller's quick thinking, which led to the alleged abuser being arrested. The unnamed woman told local media her mum was being attacked at the time. This tactic for subtly calling the emergency services has been internet lore for years, but this is a rare confirmed case of it being effective. Officials have previously warned that the strategy is not guaranteed to work, as dispatchers are not trained to recognise a pizza order as a genuine call for help. Russian domestic violence: Women fight back Stalking software is 'on the rise' Domestic abuse 'biggest child protection threat' The dispatcher who answered the call, Tim Teneyck, told local news station 13 ABC he initially thought the womanhad dialled an incorrect number,external. When she insisted she was through to the right person, he realised what was happening - partly because he had seen similar scenarios being shared on social media. ""You see it on Facebook, but it's not something that anybody has ever been trained for,"" Mr Teneyck said. ""Other dispatchers that I've talked to would not have picked up on this. They've told me they wouldn't have picked up on this."" Here's a transcript of the conversation. Mr Teneyck:Oregon 911 Caller:I would like to order a pizza at [address redacted]. Mr Teneyck:You called 911 to order a pizza? Caller:Uh, yeah. Apartment [redacted]. Mr Teneyck:This is the wrong number to call for a pizza... Caller:No, no, no. You're not understanding. Mr Teneyck:I'm getting you now. Later in the call, the woman found creative ways to answer Mr Teneyck's yes or no questions about how much danger she and her mother were in, and what services they needed. Mr Teneyck:Is the other guy still there? Caller:Yep, I need a large pizza. Mr Teneyck:All right. How about medical, do you need medical? Caller:No. With pepperoni. It is unclear where exactly the idea originated, but a very similar scenario was used in a campaign by the Norwegian Women's Shelter Association in 2010. Four years later, in May 2014, a user on discussion website Reddit claiming to be a 911 operator described a domestic abuse victim calling to order a pizza. They wrote that the call ""started out pretty dumb, but was actually pretty serious"" - before describing a conversation similar to the one Mr Tenyck had. A few months later a number of news sites reported on the Reddit post, and in 2015 it was even turned intoa Super Bowl ad addressing domestic abuse,external. The scenario later became a viral ""public service announcement"" on social media, with one Facebook post making the unsubstantiated claim that ""dispatchers are trained"" to recognise the pizza call as a call for help, and to ask specific questions. This claim was debunked last year. Christopher Carver, the dispatch centre operations director for the National Emergency Number Association in the US, told the Associated Press that police are not trained to listen out for any specific code words or scenarios. ""Setting any expectations of secret phrases that will work with any 911 centre is potentially very dangerous,"" he said, and recommended that people use 911's SMS service instead. But the ""Text to 911"" service is not available in all US locations, and is not functioning in Oregon city in Ohio. Mr Carver did say that dispatchers would not hang up on a caller. The priority, he added, is for callers to let the dispatcher know their location. People who need to make a discreet call to 999 - the UK's emergency services number - can do so using the British police's ""silent solution"" system. A 999 caller who is unable to speak can key in the number 55,externalto silently inform officers that they are experiencing a genuine emergency.

"Coca-Cola says a video made by Labour-backing group Momentum using the company's footage was done without their permission or endorsement. The video posted to the campaigners' social media feeds used edited footage from the iconic Coca-Cola ""holidays are coming"" advert from the 1990s. It superimposed Labour slogans onto the side of lorries and ended with an image of Jeremy Corbyn as Santa Claus. Coca-Cola said it was ""taking steps"" to ensure it was permanently removed. The BBC understands the US soft drinks giant is seeking legal advice on the matter. The video was viewed more than 70,000 times and shared widely on Twitter before the site blocked it for copyright reasons. The original post was removed by Momentum about 30 minutes after Coca-Cola issued a statement warning of action. A Coca-Cola spokeswoman said: ""We have been made aware of a social post from Momentum which uses footage from the Coca-Cola Christmas advert. The film is in no way endorsed by the Coca-Cola Company and we have not given permission for any footage to be used in this way. We are taking steps to ensure this is removed."" One leading copyright lawyer said Momentum could be in danger of facing a substantial damages claim from the company. ""I imagine a cease-and-desist letter has already been submitted to Momentum,"" Helen Griffin, senior associate solicitor at Harrison Drury, told the BBC. ""Companies need to act quickly in these situations to keep as many legal remedies open as possible. The letter is the first step and will probably include any details of trademarks and copyright ownership that Coca-Cola has."" Momentum is likely to have a short deadline in which to comply, she added. Alternatively, the firm has the option of seeking a court injunction. It comes after another iconic advert was also used for political purposes on social media. On Thursday, The Sun newspaper posted a video filmed in the style of BT's famous 1980s ""Beattie"" advert - featuring the ad's original actress Maureen Lipman but not using any of BT's footage. The spoof ad attacked Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour party's policies. BT has not yet commented.

"Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer came out fighting with a speech that secured the support of both her party and her chief critic Angela Merkel's would-be successor as German chancellor has threatened to stand down as leader of the CDU if her centre-right party fails to back her. Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, known as AKK, urged critics to support her vision for Germany at the party's annual congress in Leipzig. She has faced mounting criticism since replacing Mrs Merkel as CDU leader. However, her threat to resign prompted a lengthy ovation and a pledge of loyalty from her main critic. Poor election results and her low popularity have led to discontent within the CDU. But in a speech on Friday, Ms Kramp-Karrenbauer, 57, issued an ultimatum to her opponents. ""If you are of the opinion that the Germany I want is not the one you want... then let's end it. Here, now and today,"" Ms Kramp-Karrenbauer told delegates. ""But, dear friends, if you want this Germany, if you want to take this path together... then let's roll up our sleeves here and now and make a start."" Is Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer Merkel 2.0? Merkel bids emotional farewell to party Germany country profile At the end of the speech, delegates gave the party leader a standing ovation that lasted at least three minutes. Mrs Merkel, who also gave a speech at the congress, struck a more conciliatory tone, calling for party unity. Ms Kramp-Karrenbauer replaced Angela Merkel as CDU leader in December 2018 As leader of the Christian Democratic Union - Germany's largest party - Ms Kramp-Karrenbauer is favourite to succeed Mrs Merkel when she stands down in 2021. She was also given the role of defence minister during the summer, but shocked colleagues when she suggested sending German soldiers to northern Syria as part of a an international security zone. Friedrich Merz, a millionaire lawyer who narrowly lost out to Ms Kramp-Karrenbauer in last year's leadership vote, recently described the CDU-led government as ""abysmal"". He remains one of Ms Kramp-Karrenbauer's most vociferous critics but applauded her speech and promised loyalty. ""We are loyal, to our chairwoman, and to the government,"" he said. The warm, savoury smell of lunch began to waft into the conference centre. Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer had been speaking for an hour and, as stomachs rumbled, her audience began to look a little restless. But Angela Merkel looked on approvingly as the woman she backs as her successor as party leader and, potentially, chancellor, suddenly delivered a defiant challenge to her critics and the man who's been snapping at her heels for months. The powerful - and lengthy - standing ovation which followed suggests she has the backing of her party - for now. But privately delegates confide that they're still not sure. AKK is seen as a continuity candidate, her greatest strength or her greatest weakness, depending on who you ask. Polls also suggest she doesn't have the public's confidence. It's clear Friedrich Merz, who later gave a confident and rousing speech, still considers himself to be in the running. AKK will have to tread carefully. There are two years before Mrs Merkel is due to stand down and, besides Mr Merz, a number of others nurture ambitions for the top job. They're just waiting, some more quietly than others, for the right moment to make their move. Mrs Merkel has been chancellor since 2005 but with her fourth consecutive term due to end in December 2021, party turmoil has thrown AKK's candidacy into doubt. Earlier this year, she wasforced to dismiss a report that she believed Ms Kramp-Karrenbauer was not up to the job. Since then, a fractious debate about the political direction of the party has escalated. This video can not be played How Angela Merkel rose to power to lead Germany AfD overtakes Merkel's CDU in Thuringia The right-wing nationalists shaking up Europe In the European Parliament elections in May, the conservative bloc had its worse result since World War Two. The CDU and its sister party, the Christian Social Union, finished on top but support fell to 28.9% - down more than 7% from the last election four years ago. Then, in October, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) beat the CDU into third place in the eastern German state of Thuringia. Popular in Berlin and her home state of Saarland in the south-west, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer has a reputation for calm analysis and political acumen. She joined the party as a student in 1981 and quickly rose up the ranks of state politics, becoming the first woman to serve as a state minister for internal affairs in 2000, and the first woman to serve as prime minister of Saarland.Merkel successor threatens to quit as party leader Allow Twitter content?

A Merkel loyalist, she is expected to replicate much of the chancellor's style and policy. She has differentiated herself from her mentor, however, by voting in favour of quotas for women on corporate boards and by taking a tougher line on Russia. She is also more conservative on social issues like gay marriage, and has vowed to review the country's position on security and migration.

"Tomatin Distillery said it wanted to protect its brand A place name in the Highlands is at the centre of a dispute between a whisky distiller and a hotel developer. Tomatin Distillery in Tomatin is opposed to The Tomatin Trading Company using the small village's name for its planned development in the community. The distillery's owners have raised the case at the Court of Session. Businessman William Frame said notice of the legal action had come as a ""bombshell"" and said his hotel would bring much needed jobs to the area. Tomatin is a community of about 200 people south of Inverness. Last November, Mr Frame's The Tomatin Trading Companysecured planning permission from Highland Council for a Â£10m hotel and retail development in the village. A 99-bedroom hotel, 200-seat restaurant, farm shop, drive-through bakery, food outlet, four retail units and a fuel filling station are planned. An artist's impression of hotel development at Tomatin The site is the location of Tomatin's former Freeburn Hotel, filling station and Little Chef restaurant. Construction of the development is expected to create work for 100 people and about 50 jobs once open. Tomatin Distillery said it was an ""engaged member"" of the local community and it ""wholeheartedly"" welcomed and supported any development that benefited the area. But managing director Mr Stephen Bremner added: ""We do, however, object to the development's proposed branding, which, we believe, takes unfair advantage of our reputation and we have repeatedly asked Mr Frame to reconsider. ""Tomatin Distillery has a rich heritage spanning many generations. ""We firmly believe we must protect our valuable brand, which is inherently associated with our distillery and our whisky as a result of over 120 years of dedicated craftsmanship."" Mr Frame, who has owned the site of his proposed development since 2005, said he was in a ""David and Goliath battle"" over use of the name ""Tomatin"". He said his business had kept the distillery's owners ""fully informed"" of its plans from the start and notice of the legal action had come as a ""huge disappointment"". The businessman said: ""I feel this should wholeheartedly be about helping and promoting the village of Tomatin, giving young people jobs that are sustainable and getting young people back into the Highlands.

"US Attorney General William Barr has called the death of paedophile Jeffrey Epstein ""a perfect storm of screw-ups"". In an interview with AP News, Mr Barr said the jailhouse suicide, which came as Epstein awaited trial, was due to a ""series"" of mistakes. His comments come after two guards who were responsible for Epstein were charged with falsifying prison records. Lawyers for Epstein's victims are urging Prince Andrew, a longtime friend of Epstein, to speak to US police. The US attorney general said he had personally reviewed CCTV footage that confirmed nobody entered the area where Epstein was detained on the night he died. ""I can understand people who immediately, whose minds went to sort of the worst-case scenario because it was a perfect storm of screw-ups,"" Mr Barr said in an interview as he flew to the US state of Montana for an event on Thursday. Epstein, a wealthy financier who partied with the rich and famous, died in Manhattan's Metropolitan Correctional Center while awaiting trial on charges of sexually abusing girls as young as 14. Prince Andrew's private secretary in new role Duke seen for first time since stepping back Earlier this week, two guards tasked with watching over Epstein's jail unit were charged with sleeping and browsing the internet during their shift as Epstein died. Officers Tova Noel and Michael Thomas were supposed to check on Epstein every 30 minutes. According to an indictment, the guards had not done their 03:00 or 05:00 checks. Epstein was placed on suicide watch after he was found on 23 July on his cell floor with bruises on his neck. He was taken off suicide watch about a week before his death, though kept on a heightened watch that required him to have a cellmate. This video can not be played Prince Andrew: Epstein 'a constant sore in the family' But his cellmate was transferred on 9 August to another prison a day before Epstein's death, which a medical examiner ruled to be suicide by hanging. Mr Barr, who leads the US Department of Justice, said: ""I think it was important to have a roommate in there with him and we're looking into why that wasn't done, and I think every indication is that was a screw-up. ""The systems to assure that was done were not followed."" Who was Jeffrey Epstein? The case of Jeffrey Epstein - in 300 words He added that New York prosecutors who are continuing to investigate Epstein's crimes ""say there is good progress being made"" in the case. ""And I'm hopeful in a relatively short time there will be tangible results,"" he continued. Executors of Epstein's estimated $577m (Â£450m) estate are seeking a judge's approval to create a fund to settle claims by his victims in civil cases. Jeffrey Epstein was charged with sexually abusing dozens of girls Meanwhile, victims of Epstein are calling for Prince Andrew, a former friend of Epstein, to submit to an FBI interview. The Duke of York announced on Wednesday he was stepping back from royal duties amid the fallout from his recent BBC Newsnight interview. One of Epstein's accusers, Virginia Giuffre, has claimed she was forced to have sex with the duke three times. Prince Andrew has ""categorically"" denied it.

"A group of orphaned British children caught up in the war in Syria have returned to the UK. The children, who are all from one family, are the first to be repatriated from the area of Syria once controlled by the Islamic State (IS) group. The Foreign Office was asked by the High Court to help them return. The court heard they arrived in London on Friday and were in good spirits, having met with members of their family who they had breakfast with. They were brought back to the UK at the request of relatives after they were made wards of court - meaning they were placed under supervision and protection of the High Court. The judge said it had been a complex and difficult operation. Mr Justice Keehan said the children had now gone to their family homes where they appeared settled and as happy as possible in difficult circumstances. UK to repatriate orphaned children from Syria The IS prisoners no-one wants The rise and fall of the Islamic State group Their return comes after pressure on the government - and with calls from aid agencies for all British children who survived the fall of IS to be returned to the UK. On Thursday, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the ""innocent"" children should ""never have been subjected to the horrors of war"". Mr Raab added: ""We have facilitated their return home because it was the right thing to do. ""Now they must be allowed the privacy and given the support to return to a normal life."" This video can not be played Is this the end for Islamic State? The fate of foreign IS fighters and other foreigners caught up in the conflict has been a key issue since the defeat of the extremist group was declared in March 2019. IS once controlled 88,000 sq km (34,000 sq miles) of territory stretching from western Syria to eastern Iraq. The UK had been reluctant to take back citizens from the area. Other countries including France, Denmark, Norway and Kazakhstan have brought children home. The United Nations has said countries should take responsibility for their own citizens unless they are to be prosecuted in Syria in accordance with international standards. Save The Children said the repatriation was a ""triumph of compassion in the face of cruelty,"" and that it would allow the youngsters to live full, happy lives. But Alison Griffin, head of humanitarian campaigns at the children's charity, said more work was needed. She added: ""There are still as many as 60 British children that remain stranded in appalling conditions and Syria's harsh winter will soon begin to bite. ""All are as innocent as those rescued today and our very real fear is that they won't all survive to see the spring. ""They must all be brought home before it is too late.""

"This video can not be played Corbyn: ""I will adopt a neutral stance on Brexit"" Jeremy Corbyn has said he would remain neutral in a future Brexit referendum if Labour wins power. He told a BBC Question Time leaders' special he would not campaign for Leave or Remain so it would allow him, as prime minister, to ""credibly"" carry out what the voters then decide. Prime Minister Boris Johnson later asked how Mr Corbyn could be ""indifferent"" on such a vital issue. But Mr Johnson faced questions of his own about whether he could be trusted. The prime minister was the fourth party leader to answer the audience's questions, with the SNP's Nicola Sturgeon and Liberal Democrat Jo Swinson also taking to the stage for 30 minutes each on Friday evening. Pressed on whether politicians should be relied upon to tell the truth, Mr Johnson said this was ""absolutely vital"". While trust was a crucial issue for voters, he argued the biggest threat to public confidence was the ""corrosive"" effect of Parliament trying to block Brexit. Fact-checking the leaders' debate Kuenssberg: No comfortable ride for the party leaders Five standout moments Live: Reaction to Question Time special He said the Labour, SNP and Lib Dem leaders wanted to ""basically frustrate"" the result of the 2016 referendum, which the public had been waiting more than three years to see delivered, by ""absurdly"" holding another one. He said that the Labour leader's views seemed to have ""mutated"" and Mr Corbyn's ambition to negotiate an improved agreement would be totally undermined if he did not care whether the public backed it or not. ""He is now going to be neutral on the deal he proposes to do. I don't see how he can do a deal when he is going to be neutral or indifferent."" This video can not be played Watch highlights from the Question Time leaders' special The four leaders all appeared individually and faced a mixture of audience questions and follow-up questions from host Fiona Bruce at the event in Sheffield. The first to take the stage, Mr Corbyn, faced tough questioning about his economic polices, with one member of the audience suggesting his ""reckless socialist"" agenda ""terrified"" him and his family. The Labour leader said his plans to take Royal Mail, the railways, the water industry and broadband delivery into public ownership had been ""set out"" very clearly and were aimed at ""delivering an economy that works for all"". He insisted business had ""nothing to be frightened of"" by his plans, saying his ""fully prepared and costed manifesto"" would bring the country together and help reduce inequality. Mr Corbyn was criticised for what several audience members suggested was a lack of clarity on whether he personally would support or oppose Brexit in a new referendum in 2020, with one questioner saying: ""Why would anyone vote for Labour without knowing the answer to that question?"" Mr Corbyn said it was ""entirely reasonable"" to put the question back to the people as another referendum represented a sensible middle ground between those who wanted to cancel Brexit entirely and those backing the PM's deal. Asked to clarify his own position, he said: ""I will adopt, if I am prime minister at the time, a neutral stance so I can credibly carry out the results of that to bring our communities and countries together rather than continuing an endless debate."" He later told the audience: ""You heard it here first on Question Time."" REALITY CHECK:Leaders' claims scrutinised VIDEO:The best bits, in three minutes FIVE MOMENTS:The key takeaways ANALYSIS:Laura Kuenssberg's take TWITTER REACTION:Audience gains social media respect In doing this, he would follow in the footsteps of Harold Wilson - who allowed Labour ministers to campaign on both sides in the 1975 Common Market referendum and took a back seat during the campaign - although he personally backed staying in. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Health Secretary Matt Hancock attacked Mr Corbyn's position, saying he had ""decided to be indecisive"" and it ""won't wash with the voters"". But shadow employment rights secretary Laura Pidcock defended Mr Corbyn's stance as ""brave"". ""What we are saying is we trust the people to have the final say,"" she told Today. It's not clear if the lively grilling of major politicians will shift the dial at this election. But it certainly marked a shift in Jeremy Corbyn's position on Brexit. He had been put under pressure by his opponents to say whether he would support Leave or Remain in the new referendum Labour is promising. So he tried to eliminate a negative by providing clarity, of a sort: a clear commitment to stay neutral. Labour's strategists are suggesting he could now be seen as an honest broker that can bring a divided country together. In truth, though, behind the scenes there are fears that the party may have over-estimated the threat from the Lib Dems and underestimated the importance voters in Leave areas attach to delivering Brexit. So his neutrality is in part an attempt to reassure those voters that his promised referendum isn't the means of cancelling Brexit by the back door. His followers will say he has risen above the fray; his critics - that he has become more decisive about sitting on the fence. Questioned on the issue of tackling incidents of anti-Semitism in the Labour Party, Mr Corbyn was accused of failing to intervene when one of his own Jewish MPs, Ruth Smeeth, was heckled by an activist at a party event in 2016. Mr Corbyn said Ms Smeeth and others had ""suffered terrible abuse"". He insisted that all forms of racism and misogyny were ""unacceptable"" and party activists who had abused MPs had been disciplined or expelled. When Mr Johnson took the stage, he dismissed suggestions he was trying to suppress the findings of a report into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 referendum vote as ""Bermuda triangle stuff"". ""There is no evidence whatsoever, that I know of, to show any interference in any British electoral event,"" the Conservative leader said. He insisted his party had ""zero tolerance"" towards Islamophobia and said he regretted any offence he had caused in articles about race during his journalistic career - including a piece in 2018 in which he likened Muslim women wearing burqas to letter boxes and bank robbers. But he defended the right to freedom of speech and did not accept an audience member's invitation to say ""sorry"" for writing them. Labour's economic plans would be ""ruinous"" for the country, he argued, but he also acknowledged his plan to cut national insurance bills for low-earners - expected to be the main tax announcement in the Conservative manifesto - would only have a modest impact. On the NHS, Mr Johnson stuck by his claims that the health service was receiving the biggest cash injection in its history. He added: ""Of course I understand that things have been tough in the NHS and understand the pressures the NHS is under. I know the massive demand the NHS faces but we can only meet that demand if we have a dynamic economy."" The SNP's Nicola Sturgeon said voting for her party in Scotland was the best way of ""depriving"" the Tories of a majority across the UK. Asked about what she would do in the event of another hung Parliament on 12 December, she said she would not work with the Tories but was prepared to deal with Labour if Jeremy Corbyn committed to end austerity and agreed to hold another Scottish independence referendum.

""It is not for Westminster to decide. It is for the people of Scotland."" When it was pointed out to her that Mr Corbyn had just stated to viewers that he would not sanction another independence referendum in the first two years of a Labour government, she said she was predicting what he might choose to do after the election, rather than dwelling on what he was saying now. She said: ""Do you think he's going to walk away from the chance to end austerity, to protect the NHS, stop Universal Credit, simply because he wants, for a couple of years, to prevent Scotland having the right to self-determination?"" The first minister said more needed to be done to reduce the number of drug deaths in Scotland, saying, ""I don't want to be citizen of a country where people are dying from drug issues."" Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson was immediately asked by an audience member whether she regretted saying she could become prime minister and ""how ridiculous this sounded"" - given that her party only had 20 MPs at the end of the last Parliament. She said she recognised it was a ""big ask"" for her to make it to No 10 but she believed many people were ""dismayed"" at having to choose between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn and there had to be a ""better alternative"". This video can not be played Jo Swinson: Lib Dems 'being very straightforward' on Brexit She faced awkward questions over her plans to cancel Brexit by revoking Article 50, being asked by one audience member whether she regarded all 17.4 million Leave voters as ""stupid"". Ms Swinson said this was not the case and they clearly disagreed over the benefits of being in the EU, to which she was told ""you can disagree with me but you lost"". She was also challenged over austerity and what one audience member called her party's backing for ""harsh and cruel benefit cuts"" while in coalition with the Conservatives between 2010 and 2015. She conceded the Lib Dems had made mistakes during their time in government and should have done more to limit the scale of austerity - although she said she remained supportive of the principle of the Universal Credit system - which Labour has pledged to scrap. It was not a comfortable ride for any of the four who appeared in front of the audience in Sheffield who were pressed on issues as broad as the economy, austerity, Brexit, Bolivia, the Russia report, racism, the NHS and plenty more. It was particularly uncomfortable for the Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, who was pummelled by the audience over her promise to stop Brexit by simply halting the process altogether in the unlikely event she won a majority. There were moments of real challenge too for Boris Johnson first on a very simple question - can he be trusted? The audience's attitude made it clear they have a big question about that, and about him. Read more from Laura here.

"Barclays has become the latest big company to pull its support for Prince Andrew's business mentoring initiative. The bank joined firms including Standard Chartered and KPMG in cutting ties with Pitch@Palace, which provides start-ups with advice and contacts. There has been a growing backlash over a BBC Newsnight interview about the royal's friendship with convicted US sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The princeis stepping down from royal dutiesfor the ""foreseeable future"". Following Wednesday's statement confirming this, a variety of organisations have continued to announce the end of their association with the prince. The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra was among those on Friday to confirm he would no longer be its patron. Announcing its decision to cut ties with the Pitch@Palace, Barclays, which had been an official partner of the scheme, said: ""In light of the current situation, we have informed Pitch@Palace that going forward we will, regretfully, no longer be participating in the programme.

Amanda Thirsk, who has worked for the duke since 2012, will become chief executive of Pitch@Palace. It remains unclear what role the duke will have at Pitch@Palace, which he founded in 2014, moving forwards.

She said: ""The duke will continue to work on Pitch and will look at how he takes this forward outside of his public duties, and outside of Buckingham Palace. ""We recognise there will be a period of time while this transition takes place."" BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell said the decision to move Ms Thirsk into her new role was part of a ""downscaling"" of the duke's office. The BBC understands there are no plans to recruit a replacement. Our correspondent added it was a demonstration of the Queen and Prince Charles acting ""very assertively when they perceived a reputational risk to the monarchy itself"".

"  By Jonathan Blake In the early hours of the morning on 8 May 2015, Jo Swinson stood on a makeshift stage in a leisure centre and braced herself for the news that she had lost her seat in Parliament. She appeared close to tears alongside the other candidates in East Dunbartonshire, as the returning officer delivered the result which saw the SNP’s John Nicolson elected in her place. The former business minister was one of many Liberal Democrat MPs dismissed by voters after a bruising five years in coalition government with the Conservatives. Jo Swinson addresses the East Dunbartonshire election count after losing her seat, 2015 Jo Swinson addresses the East Dunbartonshire election count after losing her seat, 2015  Of the 57 Liberal Democrats in Parliament before the 2015 general election, only eight survived. But for Jo Swinson, the “cruel and punishing night” - as it was described by her party leader Nick Clegg - was made even worse by the fact that her husband suffered the same fate. Nearly 400 miles south in Wiltshire, Duncan Hames, a Lib Dem MP whom Swinson had married in 2011, had also lost his seat. The couple, in their 30s with a 16-month-old son, found themselves both out of a job overnight. “It was hard,” Swinson tells me. “And we needed to spend some time working through what we were going to do.” But that was not, it seems, the low point of her career. She has since revealed that she had felt worse on the morning after the EU referendum. And four years on from losing her seat, having since won it back, Jo Swinson was aboard her election battle bus. Jo Swinson with reporters on the Lib Dems' 2019 election bus Jo Swinson with reporters on the Lib Dems' 2019 election bus On the side was a giant picture of her face, alongside the slogan “Stop Brexit”. This is what she promised to do, should the Lib Dems pull off a political miracle and win a majority. She had presented herself unashamedly as a candidate for prime minister, and at the end of November was at the very least poised to achieve greater prominence in the most unpredictable election in memory.  The Take That posters on the young Jo Swinson’s bedroom wall only told half the story. Yes, she was in many ways a typical teenager who worked at McDonald's at the weekend and went on holiday to Spain with her friends, but as well as swooning over Mark Owen, she showed political instincts from a young age. At 10 she was writing letters to her MP, and in secondary school mounted a campaign for girls to be allowed to wear trousers. Perhaps either refreshing or grating, depending on your level of cynicism, Swinson claims she has “always wanted to change the world”. Born in February 1980, Joanne Kate Swinson grew up in the town of Milngavie, north west of Glasgow, the younger of two children. Her mother Annette was a primary school teacher and her father Pete worked in local economic development. Although her parents weren’t overtly political, their involvement in the local community clearly had an impact. She recalls her dad delivering the Lib Dems’ signature Focus leaflets and encouraging her to “get stuck in and do things”. “[They were] very much about public service,” she says. Swinson joined the party she now leads at the age of 17, but there was no intention at that stage to make politics her career. It was 1997 and Tony Blair’s Labour Party had just won a landslide victory. So why did she choose not to be swept up in that sea change of British politics? It was, she claims, Paddy Ashdown - the then Lib Dem leader - and his focus on education and changing the electoral system that drew her to the party. Lib Dem leaders past and present - Tim Farron, Jo Swinson and Paddy Ashdown in 2015 Lib Dem leaders past and present - Tim Farron, Jo Swinson and Paddy Ashdown in 2015  “I grew up on the west of Scotland where it didn’t matter where you looked, it was wall-to-wall Labour MPs.” Proportional representation, which the Lib Dems have long advocated, seemed “a no-brainer” and encouraged Swinson to join when she went to university. Politics was still an interest rather than a career but while studying Business Management at the London School of Economics Swinson campaigned for better internet access in student accommodation. It was another example of her love of technology, having written as a schoolgirl to Smash Hits magazine's Games Corner about cheat codes.   Leader profiles: Boris Johnson Jeremy Corbyn Nicola Sturgeon Nigel Farage It was while she was at university, that she was subjected to a sexual assault, describing later how a man she had thought was her friend had tried to rape her. In 2018,she wrotethat people needed to understand that her experience was “not unusual” and called for better education on consent in schools, colleges and universities. Swinson graduated with a first class degree. Her first job, which she says she “loved”, was with Viking FM, a commercial radio station in Hull, where she was a marketing manager. But there was clearly something missing. “It was a fun job to do when I was 21, but it didn’t feel like I was making the world a better place.” But even then, her decision to run for Parliament in 2001 was not intended to be the start of a political career. Someone, she says, had suggested it would be an interesting experience. But she was taking on the former Labour deputy leader John Prescott in his rock-solid seat in Hull, and it was, as she puts it, “a seat we weren’t going to win”. Jo Swinson, election candidate 2001 Jo Swinson, election candidate 2001 There were two more unsuccessful attempts to get elected to the Scottish parliament, in Strathkelvin and Bearsden, before Swinson decided it was all or nothing. Boundary changes in the seat where Swinson grew up made it possible for a Liberal Democrat to win, something she describes as “serendipity”. “If I don’t go for this having just decided I wanted to do politics more seriously, I’d always regret it. I went for it 100%.” Frank Boles, the Liberal Democrats' local party chairman in East Dunbartonshire, was on the receiving end of her determination. “She banged on my door looking for the nomination to be our parliamentary candidate,” he recalls. There was a “slight intensity” Boles admits that came with Swinson’s confidence. But he says, “she was obviously very sharp considering how young she was at the time.” On that test of seeking election, she can claim to have more than delivered. “As a lot of people do at that age, you think the world is yours, but to have actually done it was quite something else,” Franks says, reflecting on Swinson’s boast to have stood in every election in which she has been eligible to vote. Jo Swinson was elected as Member of Parliament for East Dunbartonshire in 2005, with 42% of votes in her constituency. As the youngest MP at the time - aged 25 - she was known as the “Baby of the House”. “A rubbish title” in Swinson’s opinion. Jo Swinson, 2005 election candidate Jo Swinson, 2005 election candidate One of the defining moments of her parliamentary career came much later on, when she became the first MP to take a baby into the House of Commons during a debate. She said it “felt natural” as she’d been feeding her three-month-old son Gabriel before needing to go back into the chamber. At the time, in September 2018, she told the BBC: ""The options were: wake him up and hand him to somebody else for 20 minutes, or go in and sit down, do no harm. He stayed asleep for most of it.” The MP described it as a “step forward for modernising Parliament” and no doubt boosted her credentials as a campaigner for gender equality. But while she is readily associated with the “gender fight” as she calls it, it is not something she carries as a badge of honour or sees as a guiding force in her political career. “Like many women in politics when first elected I resisted taking on the gender fight because you get put in a ‘woman box’. “People tell you that’s all you ever talk about. People say that to me now. It’s not, I talk about lots of things.” Jo Swinson addresses crowds at the People's Vote March, London, March 2019. Jo Swinson addresses crowds at the People's Vote March, London, March 2019. But she admits to being naive about the scale of change needed. “When I was starting out in politics and in adult life, I thought a lot of those battles had been won. “Working in politics for the 10 years up to 2015 and in the corridors of power, you realise how much further there is to go.” And there are examples of where idealism has given way to pragmatism elsewhere in Swinson’s career. Wearing a T-shirt bearing the slogan “I am not a token woman” while addressing her party conference in 2001, Swinson’s opposition to all-women shortlists for parliamentary candidates could not have been clearer. On that she changed her mind, albeit feeling “depressed” at having to do so. And any opposition to tokenism appears to have been completely abandoned. The Lib Dem manifesto for the 2019 election committed to allowing all-BAME (black, Asian and minority ethnic) and all-LGBT+ shortlists. That shift in approach to policy mirrors personal changes Swinson has made to her style. In her early days as an MP, there were some personality issues when dealing with members of her constituency. “At first, sometimes relationships could be a little brittle, but that was youth,” says Frank Boles, her local party chairman. “She's worked hard on it, and is very much more comfortable with people now.” In her maiden speech, she addressed a sparsely populated House of Commons with a rehearsed composure that would not have looked out of place in a university debating society. She spoke of the need to engage young people in politics more, complete with a cringeworthy reference to the fact that it would take more than ""baseball caps and text messages"". A well-meaning, if slightly patronising, comment followed from Kelvin Hopkins, the Labour MP for Luton North who congratulated Swinson on a ""fine speech"" but added ""it is something of a surprise when someone many years younger than one's own children is the previous speaker”. Away from Parliament, Swinson indulged her running hobby and completed the Loch Ness marathon in four hours seven minutes 18 seconds. Jo Swinson with fellow MPs Stephen Crabb (l) and Edward Timpson (r) training for the 2011 London marathon Jo Swinson with fellow MPs Stephen Crabb (l) and Edward Timpson (r) training for the 2011 London marathon She raised money for the anaphylaxis campaign, a cause she is closely associated with, having a severe nut allergy. In 2013, she was taken to hospital where she said doctors “saved her life”. Although she saw her majority slightly reduced, Swinson was re-elected to Parliament in 2010. She says that after this, she saw a change in attitude from some of her fellow MPs. “I remember noticing a difference having been re-elected. There’s something about having fought your seat and won it again that commanded a different level of respect.” With that respect would come the responsibility of government. And with that, uncomfortable compromises and broken promises which live long in the memory for many.   Soon after being re-elected, the reality hit home to Jo Swinson of exactly what coalition government with the Conservatives would mean for the Liberal Democrats. “I remember how I felt in the pit of my stomach when I heard what we planned to do,” Swinson told Liberator magazine in June 2019. The party was about to break its promise not to support any rise in tuition fees for students in England, sparking rebellion and resignations from many in the newly formed coalition. The plans were passed against a backdrop of protests, as an estimated 50,000 people took to the streets in opposition. Swinson voted for the policy, though, and looks back on that with regret. “I’ve learned to trust my gut instinct, and never again fail to challenge a decision that I believed to be wrong.” At the time, with earnest understatement she described it as “the most challenging issue for Liberal Democrats in the coalition so far”. “I know that many members will find this difficult,”she wrote on the Lib Dem Voice website, “but I hope it will also be understood that there is no easy answer to the unenviable choices we have to make.” But Swinson’s repentance did not extend to reversing the decision to raise fees. The party’s 2019 election manifesto committed to reinstating maintenance grants for the poorest students but promises to “establish a review” of student finance to “consider any necessary reforms”. Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron, and his Lib Dem deputy Nick Clegg, Downing Street, May 2010 Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron, and his Lib Dem deputy Nick Clegg, Downing Street, May 2010 Ambition, perhaps, had also clouded her conviction. Swinson served as a junior ministerial aide to the Business Secretary Vince Cable and then Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg. But her aspirations went beyond that and she took the plunge and asked her party leader for a job in government. “I made a pitch for myself,”she told the Timesearlier this year. “But over and beyond that, I told [Nick Clegg], ‘I think you should have a woman in the cabinet. It doesn’t have to be me, but it would be a lost opportunity if we had five years in government and none of them were women.’” Her tactic worked and in 2012, Swinson became under secretary of state for employment relations and postal affairs. Vince Cable and Jo Swinson leave 10 Downing Street, 2012 Vince Cable and Jo Swinson leave 10 Downing Street, 2012 As business secretary, Cable remembers handing her the “tricky” job of taking responsibility for the Post Office network. She also took responsibility for legislation ensuring changes to shared parental leave and flexible working. “It was very much her legislation and she made it happen. She was generally a very competent minister,” Cable recalls. But it is Swinson’s support for the full range of austerity measures instigated by the coalition government that her political opponents continue to draw attention to. Swinson has since spoken of the party’s need to “own the failures” of the coalition government. “We lost too many arguments. When they fought dirty, we were too nice,” she told the Lib Dem conference as deputy leader in 2018. Her voting record bears witness to that. As a junior minister, Swinson voted consistently for the policy that Labour dubbed the bedroom tax, which reduced housing benefit for social tenants judged to have more bedrooms than necessary. She also supported a 1% cap on the rise in working age benefits and backed the move to make local councils responsible for providing assistance to those who couldn’t afford their council tax.      Along with austerity measures, Swinson remains associated with economic policies of the coalition. For example, she voted in favour of cutting the top rate of income tax from 50% to 45% on earnings over £150,000. A tax cut for higher earners sits in stark contrast to a recent campaign promise to put a penny on the basic rate of income tax to boost spending on the NHS. Swinson said she regrets voting for some of the austerity measures while in government, but argues the Liberal Democrats were able to prevent even harsher measures being taken. “With the financial crisis that was unfolding we did need to make cuts. We did need to constrain spending because of the deficit.” But when the 2015 election came, voters delivered their verdict and Swinson found herself, along with dozens of other Liberal Democrat MPs, ousted from Parliament and out of a job.  Sympathy for MPs who find themselves out of a job might be hard to find among the general public but Vince Cable, who knows both Swinson and her husband, said it hit them hard. “They were potentially out on the streets, not literally but they were in a very difficult position. “I was really impressed by the personal resilience of being able to manage that situation without going to pieces, and doing it in a practical way and coming out in a good place.” Swinson compares the experience to the one her father had in his 50s when he was made redundant. “I remember watching my Dad go through it when I was a teenager… that was really tough.” The couple’s eldest son Andrew was “a brilliant tonic”, according to Swinson. “Any thought that you’d sit around and mope, there’s just no way you can do that when you’ve got a 16-month-old who wants to get up and be played with and go to the park and all those things.” She took the opportunity to write a book, Equal Power: Gender Equality and How to Achieve It, having realised that “it wasn’t a problem that was going to be solved by government on its own”. But Swinson still felt the pull of politics. In 2017 she jumped at the chance to win back her seat and returned to Parliament. Jo Swinson with husband Duncan Hames on election night 2017 Jo Swinson with husband Duncan Hames on election night 2017 In a south London pub, one evening not long before the 2019 general election was called, Liberal Democrat MPs gathered for a low-key night out. One who’d recently joined the party reflected that it was the first time she had laughed with colleagues in a very long time. “It’s the first time I can remember socialising enjoyably with colleagues.” The group had been for dinner at a pub in Kennington, “nothing very fancy”, the MP says, but credits Swinson with recognising the importance of morale. “She sees the value in the fact we should be doing that.” Although she admits thinking a long time ago about whether she could lead the party, deciding to go for it was something Swinson did not set her sights on early. “It crept up on me,” she says. When her predecessor first announced his intention to stand down towards the end of 2018, Swinson’s second child was two months old. “At which time I was mainly thinking about whether I’d be able to make and finish drinking a cold cup of tea,” she adds. Tim Farron, another former leader, told her she’d lead the party one day but “properly deciding to absolutely go for it” didn’t happen until the beginning of 2019. In July this year, Jo Swinson was elected as leader of the Liberal Democrats, winning 47,997 votes to her opponent, Sir Ed Davey’s 28,021. Notwithstanding the after-work drinks and friendly WhatsApp messages to colleagues, there is an uncompromising side to her leadership. “Authority is her thing,” one parliamentary colleague said. “If necessary being very firm with people who aren’t toeing the line or not up to the job. “In terms of how she manages staff, if they're not up to the job they go. She’s got very high standards and is tough in enforcing them.” The Lib Dems’ party culture is such that very little happens without the say-so of grass-roots members and policy decisions are often taken by committee. There were raised eyebrows and rumblings of discontent, when it was announced at the 2019 conference that the party would campaign to revoke Article 50 - which sets out the process for a country to leave the EU - without a further referendum if it won a majority. Although the outcome seemed highly unlikely, at least one senior party figure felt it hadn’t been properly consulted on and risked sending the wrong message to supporters.  Jo Swinson speaking at an election rally, November 2019 Jo Swinson speaking at an election rally, November 2019  There is an eye for detail which can be a frustration for those working closely with Swinson. Frank Boles is used to constituency leaflets coming back marked “with a classic purple pen”. “Bits of paper don’t go out until she’s had a chance to scrawl all over them and rewrite them. “Sometimes you’ll say, ‘Back off Jo, we’ll write these for you, you’ve got other things to do.’” Recently, Swinson denied losing control of her party after a candidate in a marginal seat stood aside to avoid splitting the remain-supporting vote and handing it to the Conservatives. Tim Walker withdrew from the race in Canterbury but the party announced he would be replaced. Jo Swinson said there had been “a healthy debate” in the party leading to some candidates deciding to stand aside. But the episode demonstrated the risk of Swinson’s strategy to fight Labour head-on and set the Lib Dems apart as the only truly UK-wide Remain party. As the leader of a party defending just 19 seats, declaring yourself a candidate to run the country attracted a level of derision and ridicule. But her predecessor did the same, and maintained that it was the only option if Swinson wanted to be taken seriously. “It's a very long shot but it's a totally legitimate ambition and if you didn't have it people would wonder what the hell are we there for,” Sir Vince Cable said. Swinson did admit that it would be “a big step” for the Liberal Democrats to win a majority, which was nothing if not an understatement. Having inherited a party in good shape and welcomed MPs from other parties keen to ride the Lib Dems’ anti-Brexit wave, expectations among the party’s supporters were enormous. Asked if she had thought about winning, and seeing herself in No 10, Swinson laughed. “Yeah, but I don’t think about the last bit because I’m not sure I like the idea of moving.” It was a long way from East Dunbartonshire to Downing Street after all.

The NHS:All of the parties agree the NHS needs more money but a row is likely over whether the NHS would be included in trade negotiations after Brexit - a criticism directed at Boris Johnson by Jeremy Corbyn a number of times previously. Mr Johnson has said the NHS ""will never be for sale"". The Liberal Democrats' manifesto has the NHS at the fore and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon has pledged to protect the NHS from becoming a ""bargaining chip"" in any future trade deals. Climate change:We've heard a number of ""green"" pledges in this election so far - so this is another issue the leaders are likely to be quizzed on.Polling earlier this month revealed a potentially significant shiftelevating the environment to being among voters' top priorities. The Conservative government has already committed to cutting emissions to zero by 2050, Labour wants to ""substantially"" reduce emissions by 2030, the Lib Dems want to spend Â£100bn tackling the effects of climate change and the SNP wants net-zero emissions by 2045 at the latest. Scottish independence and coalitions:Nicola Sturgeon is bound to talk about this issue, as the SNP want a referendum on Scottish independence in 2020. The issue will potentially be framed in the context of hypothetical coalition deals between leaders in the event of a hung Parliament, where no party has an absolute majority - the SNP's condition for joining a coalition is support for a Scottish referendum. Both the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats have said they would block a second vote. And Boris Johnson says a Labour-SNP coalition would be ""chaotic"". If the Lib Dems were in a position to form a coalition, they have suggestedthey would request another referendum on Brexit- deputy leader Sir Ed Davey suggested this week his party would support the Tories if they agreed to this. Boris Johnson:There are a few things here. Jeremy Corbyn is likely to bring up the NHS and his claim it could be included in trade negotiations by the Tories post-Brexit. And we could be reminded of Mr Johnson's failure to keep to hispledge to take the UK out of the EU by 31 October. We might also hear aboutinternal party issues on Islamophobiaand Mr Johnson's commitment to an investigation. Plus there is the ongoing row over the publication of aparliamentary report on alleged Russian interference in UK democracy. Jeremy Corbyn:Expect the Labour leader to be criticised for his Brexit policy, as he has been before. Critics have questioned whether he would back Remain or Leave in a further Brexit vote. Alsolook out for questions about his party's own internal row, over anti-Semitism. Jo Swinson:The other leaders may jump on her party's move away from earlier bold language suggesting her bid for No 10 was realistic - on Wednesday she admitted her party had been ""squeezed"", when asked about a dip in recent polls.She'll also likely be quizzed on whether she would block a Tory or Labour governmentand on how the Lib Dems would unite a country that voted to leave the EU if they cancelled Brexit. Nicola Sturgeon:Scottish independence remains the biggest issue for the SNP leader, followed by Brexit - Scotland voted Remain.  Ms Sturgeon has already said she will request a ""Section-30 order"", which grants permission for a new referendum from the UK government.But Mr Johnson has ruled this outif he becomes prime minister. The audience will be selected by the Question Time production team to reflect how people in the country have voted. People apply online or by phone and will be asked about their past voting patterns and future voting intentions, whether they're members of political parties, and how they voted in the EU referendum. The BBC aims to represent audiences across the UK during its election coverage, so while the audience will probably be broadly local to the venue, to ensure there are sufficient supporters of all the parties some will have travelled further. You can read more about the BBC's election debateshere, and the BBC's election guidelineshere. The production team will ask audience members to submit questions and then choose the best and most representative of these - they'll ensure there is a range of political opinions among the questioners. The first time the panel hears each question is when the audience member asks it. Throughout the programme, audience members are also given the opportunity to ask further spontaneous questions to the panel, or, of course, to make their own comments. You can also watch the programme streamed live on the BBC News website. BBC World News will air the debate live from 19:00-21:00 GMT, with on-screen reaction and analysis from the BBC's Reality Check and specialist correspondents.

Although there are arecord number of female candidates this year,external, it is still just a third of the total. The fact that female names are so low on our list isn't just because of gender imbalance, though.Women's names are more diverse than men's in general, so are less likely to be grouped together.

Boris Johnson brother Jo was elected inOrpington,externalin 2010 butstood down earlier this year. The two biggest Westminster parties, Labour and the Conservatives, have the best coverage in terms of candidates, although neither has a representative in every constituency. Both are staying away fromChorley,external, held bynew Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle. And the Conservatives - the full name of which is the Conservative and Unionist Party - are contesting a handful of seats in Northern Ireland where Labour are not. It's a tradition that the main parties allow the Speaker to be re-elected unopposed, as he's supposed to be impartial. Sir Lindsay's two opponents in Chorley are the Green Party's James Melling and an independent called Mark Brexit-Smith. The latter was going to be the Brexit Party candidate before he was stood down by the national party. Hechanged his name to get round electoral rules,externalthat limit descriptions of independents on ballot papers. Nigel Farage has controversiallywithdrawn his candidates from the 317 seatsthe Conservatives won in the 2017 election. Unfortunately for them, that leaves the party unable to compete for a lot of the areas with the highest amount of 2016 Leave voters, likeClacton,externalandBoston & Skegness,externalalong the east coast of England. They hope to be most effective in Leave-voting Labour-marginals in northern England, likeWorkington,externalandBishop Auckland. There are some seats won by other parties in 2017 where the Brexit Party isn't standing - typically Remain areas. A lot of those are in Scotland, like Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson'sDunbartonshire East,externalseat. Labour/Tory marginalCanterbury,external, in south-east England, is another. On the other side of the Brexit divide,a pact between the Lib Dems, the Green Party and Plaid Cymru- the Welsh national party - has meant many of their candidates have stood aside in areas where one of the others is more likely to win. TheIsle of Wight,externalandBrighton Pavilion,externalare two English seats where the Greens will have no Liberal Democrat opposition, as well asVale of Glamorgan,externalin south Wales. The Lib Dems have been allowed a free run to try to repeat their by-election success inBrecon & Radnorshire,external, as well as Tory-heldWinchester, where three in five voters backed remain in the 2016 referendum. Plaid Cymru have been allowed to target a few northern Welsh seats where they are particularly strong, includingYnys Mon,external, which is currently held by Labour.

FULL PROGRAMME:Catch-up on iPlayer FACT-CHECKED AND ANALYSED:On our website live page HIGHLIGHTS:The best bits, in three minutes The SNP has stood candidates in all 59 seats in Scotland. It performed incredibly well in 2015, winning all but three - one each for Labour, the Conservatives and the Lib Dems. They were down to 35 in 2017 but hope that the unpopularity in Scotland of the Labour and Conservative Westminster leaders will allow them to win back some of those seats. UKIP has substantially fewer candidates this year compared to both 2017 and its high point in the 2015 election. After standing almost everywhere in 2015 and securing 12.6% of the vote (although just one seat), UKIP has scaled down its ambitions. The Independent Group for Change has put up three candidates: leader Anna Soubry, Chris Leslie and Mike Gapes. They are defending seats won in 2017, but they were won as Conservative and Labour candidates. The Yorkshire Party is standing in 28 seats on a platform of devolved power for Yorkshire and the Christian Peoples Alliance has 29 candidates. No other party has more than 25 candidates, although the Monster Raving Loony Party is closest with 24, includingBoris Johnson's opponent Lord Buckethead,external,Jeremy Corbyn's rival Nick The Incredible Flying Brick,externaland leader ""Howling Laud"" Hope inHampshire North East,external. There are also interestingelectoral pacts in Northern Irish politics. The Alliance Party, the biggest liberal centrist party in Northern Ireland, is only party to be contesting every seat in the country. Alliance performed well at theEuropean elections in May,external, coming third behind the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn Fein and winning their first ever MEP in the process. Sinn FÃ©in, the biggest republican party in Northern Ireland, has stood down from three seats it would usually contest -Belfast East,Belfast SouthandNorth Down- to make way for its fellow remain-supporting parties, Alliance and the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP). The DUP, whose 10 seats won in 2017 allowed it to form a ""confidence and supply"" arrangement to prop up Theresa May's Conservative government, has stood down for a fellow unionist party, the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), inFermanagh & South Tyrone,external.

"This video can not be played Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage makes election pitch Nigel Farage has unveiled the Brexit Party's general election policies, promising a ""political revolution that puts ordinary people first"". The party leader pledged to halve the foreign aid budget, abolish the House of Lords and cap permanent immigration at 50,000 a year. The Brexit Party is running in 275 seats, after deciding to stand down in the 317 won by the Tories in 2017. It is also promising a ""clean break"" from all EU institutions. LIVE: Latest updates from the election campaign How much does a general election cost? What are the Brexit Party's key policies? Speaking in London, Mr Farage said his party would scrap VAT on fuel bills and stop companies earning less than Â£10,000 a year paying corporation tax. He promised millions of trees would be planted to absorb carbon emissions. Mr Farage said his party would save tens of billions of pounds by redirecting foreign aid, scrapping the HS2 rail project and stopping the UK's contributions to the EU. He also claimed the party could recover Â£7bn from the UK's share of capital at the European Investment Bank. Mr Farage said he favoured making civil servants sign a ""pledge of political neutrality"" and devising ""political guidelines"" for the Supreme Court. He added that any Brexit Party MPs elected would ""hold Boris Johnson to his word"" over Brexit, and act as ""new radicals"" in Parliament to ""change politics for good"". Mr Farage accused the Conservatives of having ""no intention"" of reducing immigration numbers, as firms that supported them wanted ""cheap labour"". ""We would very much want to get immigration numbers down to what for 60 years were very acceptable and very workable post-war levels,"" he said. ""Yes, I'm talking around about 50,000 people a year."" Mr Farage added that work permits would give ""flexibility"" to the system, as there was a difference between permanent settlement and allowing workers to come for a ""time-limited period"". Other pledges include:,external Introducing a ban on exporting waste to other countries for it to be burned Providing free ""base level"" broadband for deprived regions, and free wi-fi on all public transport Abolishing business rates for shops outside the M25, funded by a ""small online sales tax"" Scrapping all interest on student loans, and abolishing inheritance tax Phasing out the BBC licence fee Limiting postal voting to people who are elderly, infirm or overseas Several other political parties have launched traditional manifestos - outlining policy commitments for government - this week, but Mr Farage and his colleagues have declined to do so. The former UKIP leader, who is not standing as a candidate in the election, said manifestos were a ""means of telling people what they want to hear without ever having the genuine desire to implement them"". Instead, he said his party would be making a ""contract with the people,external"" containing a ""targeted set of deliverable pledges"". The Brexit Party has changed its tune on, yes, Brexit. Until a few weeks ago its leader, Nigel Farage was saying a no-deal Brexit was the ""only acceptable deal"". But this ""contract"" moves the goalposts. Gone is the criticism of Boris Johnson's withdrawal agreement - now the party simply promises there will be ""no extended transition period"" after Brexit. Without saying so explicitly in this document, the Brexit Party is warning that it will campaign to ensure Mr Johnson sticks to his promise not to extend the transition any further. Read more here Brexit:The Conservatives say they will deliver Brexit by the end of January 2020 under the terms of the PM's deal negotiated with the EU. The Liberal Democrats have vowed to cancel Brexit if elected as a majority government, or otherwise campaign for a referendum including the option of staying in the EU. Labour wants to renegotiate the PM's Brexit deal then put it to a referendum within six months, with the option of staying in the EU. The party has not said which side it would take in such a vote. The SNP wants Scotland to stay in the EU. Immigration:Labour has not set a target in its manifesto, but has pledged to regulate the labour market to stop the ""undercutting of wages and conditions"". For the Tories, Home Secretary Priti Patel has previously said overall immigration should come down, but not according to an ""arbitrary"" target. Boris Johnson has promised to reduce unskilled migration. The SNP says cutting immigration would damage the Scottish economy. Trees:The Conservatives have said they will plant 30 million trees a year by 2025 if they win the election. The Liberal Democrats have pledged to plant twice as many trees in the same period. Labour has promised an ""ambitious programme of tree planting"", including a forest of a million trees to help the NHS become carbon neutral.

"This video can not be played Grace Millaneâs father David paid tribute to his daughter and said her murder had ""ripped apart"" the family A man who strangled a British backpacker and hid her body inside a suitcase has been found guilty of murder. Grace Millane was found buried in bushland outside Auckland, New Zealand. A jury at the city's high court rejected claims by the 27-year-old man, who cannot be named, that she died accidentally during ""rough sex"". Ms Millane's parents David and Gillian wept in the public gallery as jurors convicted their daughter's killer. The murder trial that gripped a nation He showed no emotion as the verdict - reached after about five hours of deliberations - was read out. University of Lincoln graduate Grace Millane was on a round-the-world trip at the time of her death Justice Simon Moore said the defendant would be sentenced on 21 February next year. The identity of Grace Millane's murderer cannot be disclosed for now due to a court suppression order that bans media from naming and picturing him. The purpose in New Zealand courts is to protect people not yet proven guilty - but also to have a fairer trial by ensuring the jury is not prejudiced by media coverage. Images can also be withheld. Justice Simon Moore ordered that the suppression order which prevents naming the defendant would remain in place indefinitely until lifted by the court. Mr and Mrs Millane, who had flown to New Zealand to attend the trial, said the verdict would be ""welcomed by every member of the family and friends of Grace"". Her family described Miss Millane as ""our sunshine"" Speaking outside the court, an emotional Mr Millane said the family's lives had been ""ripped apart"" by his daughter's ""barbaric"" murder. ""Grace was our sunshine and she will be missed forever,"" he said. Jurors heard the defendant and Ms Millane had met via the Tinder dating app on 1 December last year, the night before Ms Millane's 22nd birthday. They spent several hours drinking cocktails in bars around Auckland before going to the defendant's hotel. In the hours before she disappeared Miss Millane and the defendant were seen in the Sky City Development Ms Millane, from Wickford, Essex, was found in the mountainous WaitÄkere Ranges a week later. Suspect 'went on date while body in room' CCTV 'shows accused wheeling body in suitcase' 'Solo backpacking didn't kill Grace' Prosecutors said post-mortem examinations found bruises ""consistent with restraint"" on her body, and that she had been strangled. On the night of her death, the court heard, the defendant ""wasn't distressed or concerned by her death"", and set about making plans to dispose of her remains. He ""sexualised"" the killing by searching for pornography, stopping at one point to take lewd photos of her corpse, prosecutors said. This video can not be played Grace Millane's last movements were captured on CCTV The following day, he went on a Tinder date with another woman while the body of Ms Millane remained in the hotel room. He had bought a second suitcase in a bid to cover his tracks, as well as cleaning products and a shovel, jurors heard. The defendant did not give evidence in his defence. The killer's identity is suppressed under New Zealand law Following the verdict, the step-brother of the murderer spoke to television station TVNZ reporter Paul Hobbs. The man, who also cannot be named for legal reasons, said he initially thought Miss Millane's death could have been an accident but when he saw the timeline of events, his view changed. His step-brother, he said, was ""a pathological liar that lies over pointless things and continues to lie until the point where he's got no out - absolutely no out -  and then he just breaks down and cries and runs away. ""It's just absolutely terrible that a life had to be lost because of it."" He said he did not think his step-brother intended to kill Grace, but said: ""In that moment he just kept goingâ¦ and he took Grace's life."" In an interview with police, shown during the trial, the defendant was seen to break down in tears. ""His tears, to me, they're more tears for himself."" Apologising to the Millane family, he added: ""I'm just so, so incredibly sorry for their loss. ""To know it's one of our family members - even though it's not our actions - it's very difficult, and I can't imagine the pain and hurt and what [the Millane family] had to go through for a court hearingâ¦ to me that's all because he doesn't have any shred of a decent human being inside him, and couldn't just confess to the fact he murdered her."" Tinder said it was ""deeply saddened"" by the case and ""its thoughts were with the victim's loved ones"". A spokesperson added that it was not planning to review its policies in the light of the murder but said ""the safety of our members is a top priority"" and that they were exploring new updates and technologies to enhance its safety efforts around the world. Ms Millane's death prompted an outpouring of public grief in New Zealand with the country's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern apologising to her family. The University of Lincoln graduate had been on a round-the-world trip, travelling in New Zealand for two weeks after spending six weeks in South America.

"The Brexit Party has set out the policies on which it plans to fight the 2019 general election According to its leader, Nigel Farage,the 22-page document,externalis not a manifesto but a ""contract with the people"". But what are the promises that will grab the public's attention, and, potentially win over voters on polling day, 12 December? The Brexit Party continues to talk about a ""clean-break Brexit"". The Brexit Party has changed its tune on, yes, Brexit. Until recently its leader, Nigel Farage, said a no-deal Brexit ""was the only acceptable deal"". This policy moves the goalposts.  Gone is the criticism of Boris Johnson's withdrawal agreement - now the party simply promises there will be ""no extended transition period"". At the moment the proposed transition period - during which the UK would follow EU rules and regulations without having any say in making them - finishes at the end of next year. Without saying so explicitly, the Brexit Party is warning that it will campaign to ensure Mr Johnson sticks to his promise not to extend the transition. That gives very little time to agree the terms of a future free trade deal. The Brexit Party continues to talk about a ""clean-break Brexit"". But whoever wins this election, the UK is likely to be negotiating with the EU about the nature of its future relationship for years to come. This policy would apply to the whole of the UK. Will this be a Brexit election? This video can not be played Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage makes election pitch The NHS must remain a publically-owned, comprehensive service that is free at the point of use. Comments by Nigel Farage about encouraging the use of private health insurance to help take the pressure off the NHS led to speculation about what this might mean for the service. The party states though that the NHS must remain a publicly-owned, comprehensive service, free at the point of use and with privatisation ruled out. There is no mention of a role for insurers or any long-term aspiration to encourage the better off to save for private healthcare. Interesting policies include 24-hour opening for GP surgeries and broadening training for nurses and midwives without the need for a degree. But there are no costings to underpin those specific measures. Health is devolved so this policy would only apply to England. 11 charts on why the NHS matters in this election Is the NHS the best health service possible? The party wants a ""fair points system"" and a ""crackdown"" on illegal immigration. Nigel Faragehas written about cutting net migration,external- immigration minus emigration - to 50,000 per year. But it is not among the policies the Brexit Party has published. The document simply promises to ""reduce annual immigration"", which is not the same thing and won't necessarily lead to lower net migration. Nevertheless, the direction of travel is clear - even if the precise destination is not. A ""clean break"" from the EU, a ""fair points system"" and a ""crackdown"" on illegal immigration are the vehicles which the Brexit Party will use to achieve its goals. But details are lacking. And there's no acknowledgement that to do this while addressing the UK's skills gap and welcoming ""genuine"" refugees - which are also manifesto pledges - is a major challenge. This policy would apply to the whole of the UK. A package of tax cuts includes a reduction in Corporation Tax. Detail is quite vague on tax and spend, and not many pledges are costed. There is little detail about the type of trade vision to be pursued after a ""clean-break Brexit"". There is no mention of income tax or VAT. No number put on the amount of money put into NHS and social care, nor investments in strategic industries than can ""create thousands of jobs"". The post-Brexit elimination of VAT on domestic fuel (currently charged at 5%) is estimated to benefit households by Â£65 each or Â£1.7bn a year. These numbers, previously used by Vote Leave, are about right. The Â£200bn the party says it will raise over the five-year Parliament appears to include the entire lifetime cost of HS2. Other notable tax cuts are for small business Corporation Tax, creating a Â£10,000 tax-free allowance. VAT policy and corporation tax are set UK-wide by Westminster. What are the challenges for the UK's economy? How much tax do British people pay? Recycle our own waste and make it illegal for it to be exported across the world to be burnt, buried or dumped at sea. This is not the first time this idea has surfaced. Every year nearly two million tonnes of British paper, cardboard and plastic are bought by recycling companies in countries like Malaysia, India and Turkey. International law already prohibits industrialised nations like the UK from exporting waste unfit to be processed. Banning the exports totally would force the British waste industry to build many new treatment plants, with repercussions for local authorities and maybe householders too. Export policy is managed at a UK level; inspections of waste shipments are handled by the devolved administrations. What is a climate emergency? There should also be free wi-fi on public transport The Brexit Party's pledge to provide ""base level domestic broadband"" in deprived regions does not specify exactly what sort of service will be offered. However, the telecoms regulator Ofcom considers speeds of 10 megabits per second (Mbps) to be""the speed which enables full participation in a digital society"".,external It has said about 16% of broadband lines across the UK could not reach those speeds. In rural areas, 32% of lines fell below this threshold. The Brexit Party's ""base level"" promise for ""deprived regions"" will reduce bills for homes which may be struggling to afford a fast broadband connection. But both the Conservatives and Labour have gone further. It has also pledged to offer free wi-fi on public transport. Some train and bus companies already provide this, and while the service can be patchy on moving vehicles, it will be welcomed by those with data-capped mobile phone tariffs. This policy would apply to the whole of the UK. CONFUSED?Our simple election guide,external POLICY GUIDE:Who should I vote for?,external POLLS:How are the parties doing?,external A TO Z:Our tool to explain election words,external BREXIT:Where do the parties stand? To phase out the BBC licence fee, which is currently Â£154.50 a year for most people. The question that immediately arises is, what do you replace it with? Advertising is one solution, but that would have a huge impact on other commercial broadcasters competing for ad spending. Direct government funding would still be a compulsory charge and could be seen to undermine the BBC's political independence. Another alternative is a Netflix-like subscription. But the challenge is how to introduce a paywall and stop people watching and listening to the BBC's many TV and radio channels. Turning the BBC into a subscription service would also fundamentally change what the BBC provides. Large parts of the BBC would disappear. This policy would apply to the whole of the UK. The tax raises less than 1% of total tax revenue, the Brexit Party says. Inheritance tax is always a political battleground, and the Brexit Party is making a clear pledge to abolish it - aiming for the support of those who worry about its complexity and whether they have to pay. The tax is a 40% levy on the estate - the property, money and possessions - of someone who has died, above a threshold of Â£325,000. No tax is paid if the estate is valued at less than Â£325,000, or if more than that is left to a husband or wife, civil partner, charity, or a community amateur sports club. There is also some relief when passing on the family home. But few people do actually pay. It was charged following 28,100 deaths in 2016-17 (4.6% of those in the UK) although the number has been rising. Abolishing it would cut off the government's receipt of Â£5.4bn a year at the last count. This policy would apply to the whole of the UK. Inheritance tax: Rules on gifts to loved ones 'should be simplified' And invest Â£50bn in regional road and rail project The Brexit Party's flagship transport policy is scrapping the HS2 high-speed rail link. That's a goal it shares with the Green Party. Nigel Farage's party says the money saved will help raise Â£200bn for regional regeneration and supporting key sectors of the economy. It calls this a ""Brexit Dividend"". It also pledges to invest Â£50bn in regional road and rail projects in development-starved regions, but does not say how many years this investment will be spread over. It is a significant sum, but falls short of what other parties are offering. Local roads are devolved, but national roads such as motorways are dealt with by Westminster. Similarly, rail services that start and end in Scotland are the responsibility of the Scottish executive. HS2 route: How much will the rail scheme cost? The amount of debt recovered from graduates would be improved by scrapping interest on student loans. The interest rates on student tuition loans have long added to the sense of injustice graduates have about their debt. Few realise until their first statement arrives the April after graduation just how much they were charged while studying for their degree. For this year's students that means 5.4%, far above the cost of government borrowing. Getting rid of the additional interest above RPI would reduce the loan balance on graduation by Â£3,000, according to Institute for Fiscal Studies analysis two years ago. After graduation, the interest rate currently varies according to your income. Student finance is devolved so this would apply to England only. And make it easier to build on brownfield sites Political parties of all colours have come a cropper on housebuilding targets. They are almost never met. So the Brexit Party has avoided them. Instead of putting a number on how many new homes it wants built, it has some relatively broad pledges to ""accelerate the pace of development"". They include simplifying the planning system, particularly on previously developed ""brownfield"" sites, and giving more flexibility to builders. None of these ideas is particularly new, but they have been notoriously difficult to fulfil. It may be telling of the party's priorities that this issue is left to last on its ""contract with the people"". Housing is devolved so this policy would only apply to England, although Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland would also benefit from any extra funding. The plans would mean a move towards a US-style system. This would mean a move towards a US-style system where senior judges are subject to confirmation hearings, where their views are scrutinised by elected politicians. There has always been a great reluctance to introduce such a system in the UK. However, since the early 1980s, there has been a significant rise in something known as judicial review - this enables an individual or group to ask a court to determine whether a decision taken by a public body, including ministers, is lawful or not. Many regard judicial review as a critical democratic check on the abuse of government power and a way of ensuring that no-one, including ministers, is above the law. However, some feel that judges - unelected and unaccountable - are now too involved in political decision-making and more should be known about their political views.

"This video can not be played A Question Time audience member, who earns over Â£80,000, criticised Labour's taxation promises A member of the audience on last night's Question Time on BBC One criticised Labour's policy of raising income taxes for people earning over Â£80,000 on the grounds that it wouldn't be enough to put them in the top 5% of earners. ""I am nowhere near in the top 5%, let me tell you, I'm not even in the top 50%,"" he said. Presenter Fiona Bruce said Labour, ""would raise income tax on those earning over Â£80,000. You're saying that would affect you because you earn over that sum?"" The man confirmed he did. HMRC publishes tables,externaleach year breaking down income taxpayers into 100 equally-sized groups based on how much they earn. The most recent figures, for 2016-17, show that you needed to be earning Â£75,300 to be in the top 5%. If you adjust that usingaverage earnings figures from the ONS,external, it's likely that you need to be earning about Â£81,000 to be in the top 5% of income taxpayers today. But the figures from HMRC exclude people earning too little to pay income tax, which means that the audience member would have been well into the top 5% of all earners. He's certainly not outside the top 50% - anything over about Â£25,000 would put him in the top half. All the figures so far have been for the whole of the UK but there are clearly regional variations in these figures. While we do not have figures for how much you would need to earn to be in the top 5% of earners in a particular region, we do have figures formedian earnings by region,external, that's the amount you'd have to earn to be in the top 50%. The region with the lowest average weekly earnings is the North East of England at Â£531.10, which is 24% or Â£168 a week lower than the highest earning region, London at Â£699.20. The audience-member also said: ""Every doctor in the country earns more than that [Â£80,000]. Every doctor, every accountant, every solicitor earns more than that."" The ONS publishes figures for average earnings in various professions (it's table 14.7a here,external). The median solicitor (that's the one half of solicitors earn more than and half earn less than) earns Â£41,127 while the median chartered or certified accountant earns Â£35,730. For doctors you have to go for the category medical practitioners, which includes anaesthetists, consultants, doctors, general practitioners, paediatricians, psychiatrists, radiologists and surgeons. Their average earnings are Â£60,838. Correction: This piece was amended to reflect the fact that the HMRC figures exclude earners who do not make enough to pay income tax.

"Plaid Cymruhas launched its 2019 manifesto,,externalcalled Wales, It's Us. It sets out the policies it wants to see introduced by the next UK government. The document calls for Wales to stay in the European Union and puts forwards its key aims for Wales under the banner ""Westminster does not work for Wales"". But what are the promises being made in a bid to win over voters on polling day, 12 December? A people's vote on Brexit and campaigning to remain in the EU. In September 2019, Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price called on his party to campaign to cancel Brexit in a general election without the need for a second referendum. Weeks later, the party's position shifted. Party members voted to support a second EU referendum, unless faced with the prospect of a no-deal Brexit, in which case Plaid would revert to unilateral revocation of the Article 50 Brexit process. In a bid to return as many pro-Remain MPs to Westminster, Plaid Cymru hasstruck an electoral pact with the Liberal Democrats and the Greens, but is not standing aside for Labour candidates, despite Jeremy Corbyn's promise of a second EU referendum. That decision could make a difference in key Labour-Conservative marginal seats and, if that in turn helps Boris Johnson secure a majority in the House of Commons, then it's curtains for a second EU referendum. Where do the main parties stand on Brexit? This video can not be played Plaid promises to ""make our own Wales"" Create tens of thousands highly skilled ""green collar jobs"" to fight climate change. Plaid Cymru is promising a Â£15bn Welsh Green Jobs Revolution paid for by the UK government increasing capital investment for 10 years and Wales getting its share of that. It would also ask the Treasury to allow the Welsh Government to borrow Â£5bn and use both funding sources pay for ""tens of thousands"" of new green jobs. Plaid Cymru promises publicly-owned full fibre broadband by 2025 - five years earlier than Labour - and said it would build 20,000 green social homes and spend Â£5bn making homes more energy efficient and reduce fuel poverty. Will this be a Brexit election? Hybrid electric and diesel trains that run from London to Wales South Wales Valleys electrification would be completed, followed by the north Wales coast line. Many in the rail industry think it was a mistake to emphasise shorter journey times as the main benefit of electrification, which is expensive. It left some wondering whether spending billions to save minutes on journeys was value for money. But electrification allows bigger trains to be run on lines. They can be more frequent and more reliable. The trains themselves are more environmentally friendly and more travellers might be encouraged to use public transport rather than cars. Businesses have long pushed for rail electrification in areas where demand justifies the cost. As with all major infrastructure projects, electrification requires a skilled workforce which will mean overcoming the current skill shortages. Extra investment in early intervention and preventative health care. Unlike the healthcare on the NHS, social care is not usually free. At the moment some people aged 65 and over will get help towards their costs, but others can pay in full. And social care is delivered by a mixture of bodies - councils, private bodies and third sector organisations. This policy was one recommended by a commission set up by Plaid Cymru to think about radical solutions to a growing problem - an ageing population. It estimated the cost of the policy would be an extra Â£247m a year, which it described as ""eminently affordable. But the truth is nobody really knows at what the final price tag would be. In a report commissioned by the Welsh Government last year, economist Gerry Holtham suggested anincome tax of between 1% and 3% could be used to fund elderly social carein Wales. What's clear is having adequate social care is important for the future of the NHS, as when care is lacking people end up in hospital - increasing the strain on a health service that's already struggling. How does social care compare to the rest of the UK? Why more people are talking about social care Establish a national commission to examine changing legislation on drug dependency. Plaid Cymru says the current hard-line approach to drugs isn't working. They say it criminalises those with an addiction, a medical need, or recreational users who ""do no harm to others"". The party is not saying it would definitely decriminalise drugs, as has happened in Portugal. Instead, it proposes a commission to reform drug laws. It also wants a public health focus to dissuade people from taking drugs, to get addicts treated and find solutions to the problems that led them to drugs in the first place. The party says that would leave police free to tackle those who profit from the drugs trade.

To fund a Â£25 a week tax credit for those paying more than 30% of their income on rent and utility bills. In the past decade, Welsh Labour governments signed up to ambitious targets to eliminate child poverty - but the ambition proved too difficult. In May this year, research by charities found Wales was the only UK nation to see an increase in child poverty last year. Now Plaid says it will introduce new legally-binding targets. As a step towards meeting them, it would pay Â£35 a week to every child in a low-income family. There would also be a tax credit of up to Â£25 a week for tenants in the private sector who spend more than 30% of their income on rent. Child poverty rise in Wales Reality Check: Plaid on poverty The money would be made available for Welsh schools and colleges. Plaid Cymru says schools are facing a ""funding emergency"" and many people working in classrooms would agree. Education is devolved, so Plaid is setting out its stall on education here rather than putting forward a plan that could be implemented at Westminster. An extra Â£300m a year for schools and colleges seems a healthy increase. But how healthy depends on the benchmark. Day-to-day spending on schools this year is Â£2.6bn. An extra Â£300m a year would make a dent in real terms spending cuts of 6% over the past decade. But Plaid's pledge includes money for colleges too, which come from a different pot, as does capital spending. The party says some of that Â£300m a year would go towards school buildings, including new Welsh medium schools. Brain Drain Wales? Teaching Welsh history - why it is important Wylfa shut at the end of 2015 - plans for its replacement have stalled To oppose the development of new sites for nuclear power plants. This has always been a tricky area for Plaid Cymru. Though they oppose nuclear power on principle, some in the party haven't wanted to turn away the jobs and investment promised by the proposed replacement of the Wylfa plant on Anglesey - the island seat is one of their top targets. Notice that this policy still gives them the wriggle room to potentially support the redevelopment of existing sites. Having said that, in the race for leadership of the party, Adam Price said a new nuclear plant would be an ""enormous burden"" that would be incompatible with Welsh independence. What's Wylfa and why is it important? The target represents two additional officers per community. The challenge for any police force is the loud cry from Joe Public that they want to see more bobbies on the beat. It's a security thing. People feel safer if there's a visible deterrent. So Plaid Cymru's offer of 1,600 more officers in Wales - two per community - will be popular. Though it is probably on a par with the numbers theConservatives have already pledged for Walesover the next three years. It's worth remembering more crime is detected, prevented and solved from an office. But with the cuts forces have faced over the past 10 years, any increase, regardless of where, would be welcomed. Reality check: Police numbers in Wales and England This video can not be played What does devolution mean for voters? Powers on corporation tax, air passenger duty and VAT for Wales. The Welsh Government has powers over some taxation, but Plaid Cymru wants more to ensure taxation raises the money Wales needs. It wants VAT revenues generated in Wales to remain there and for air passenger duty to be devolved, as happens in Scotland. It also wants Wales to have powers over corporation tax and, like the Conservatives, Plaid Cymruwants to put on hold the planned cut in corporation taxfrom 19% to 17% for 2020-21.  The party also argues the employee rate of National Insurance should rise from 2% to 4% for high earners. Decisions to go to war should require support of all four UK nations. Issues of defence and war are the responsibility of politicians in Westminster - there is no role at all for the Welsh assembly, Northern Irish assembly or Scottish parliament. Technically speaking, there isn't even a legal requirement for the prime minister to secure the support of MPs before launching military action. However, since Tony Blair's Labour government asked MPs in March 2003 to approve the Iraq invasion, a convention has developed - although not always followed - to consult the UK Parliament. But calls to formalise the UK Parliament's role haven't gone further than the drawing board, let alone include discussion of a role for the devolved assemblies and parliament.

Eastbourne's Grade II* listed Claremont Hotel was evacuated after the blaze started at about 08:50 GMT. The Pier Hotel has also been evacuated. About 60 firefighters and 12 engines were sent to the scene. Six people have been treated for minor injuries, with one taken to hospital suffering from breathing difficulties, the ambulance service said. All those who were in the hotel when the fire started have been accounted for, East Sussex Fire and Rescue Service said. The fire at Claremont hotel started at about 08:50 GMT Nearby residents have been advised to keep windows and doors closed. Roads in the area have been shut. Flames spread from the basement of the Claremont and could be seen coming out of windows and the roof. ""The building has been seriously damaged and will need to be examined by building experts before a decision is made about its future,"" a fire service spokesman said. He said the fire had been brought under control and the fire service was ""scaling back the operation"". The owners of the hotel, Daish's Holidays, said the ""significant damage"" to the hotel was ""devastating"". The company said 130 guests and staff members had been in the building when the fire broke out. A spokesman said the hotel had arranged return travel home for all guests and was contacting guests who had future bookings. ""We are devastated at the loss of the hotel and will be working tirelessly to support everyone affected by the damage."" The fire service said the blaze took hold ""very quickly"" Simon Palmer, who works at the neighbouring Pier Hotel, said the Claremont was ""engulfed in flames"" and added the fire had ""taken three-quarters of the roof away already"". He said he heard a ""very loud explosion"" and thought parts of the hotel were collapsing. Many of the guests he had spoken to were having breakfast when the blaze started so were able to escape quickly, he said. Plumes of smoke have been seen coming from the building East Sussex Fire and Rescue Service said it was using seawater to deal with the fire Drug-drivers facing renewed Christmas crackdown 'My parents were told to plan my funeral' Lorry full of chocolate bursts into flames Guests Jenny and Alan Powell, from Cheltenham, in Gloucestershire, described ""a massive explosion"".

"This video can not be played This week's impeachment hearings in three minutes President Donald Trump has pilloried an envoy who testified in the impeachment inquiry, claiming she refused to hang his photo in the US embassy in Ukraine. Mr Trump told Fox News' morning show former ambassador Marie Yovanovitch ""didn't want to hang my picture in the embassy"" in Kyiv. The president did not offer further details about the matter. Ms Yovanovitch testified last week that she was fired over ""false claims"" by people with ""questionable motives"". She was one of 12 witnesses to testify over the last fortnight in the impeachment inquiry, which may seek to remove the president from office for alleged corruption. In a phone call to Fox and Friends on Friday morning, Mr Trump defended the removal of Ms Yovanovitch. ""This ambassador, who everybody says was so wonderful,"" Mr Trump said, ""she wouldn't hang my picture in the embassy. ""She's in charge of the embassy, it took, like, a year and a half, two years."" Mr Trump added: ""She said bad things about me, she wouldn't defend me, and I have the right to change the ambassador. ""The standard is you put the president of the United States' picture in the embassy,"" he continued. ""This was not an angel, this woman, OK?"" This video can not be played Trump's live-tweets ""very intimidating"" - Yovanovitch It was not the first time the Republican president has attacked Ms Yovanovitch. Helambasted her in a tweetwhile she was testifying last Friday - a move that Democrats argued amounted to witness intimidation. The 33-year veteran of the foreign service was recalled as the American ambassador to Kyiv in May for reasons that remain murky. She testified that her anti-corruption efforts had incurred the ire of influential Ukrainians who sought to remove her. Ms Yovanovitch said she was shocked that her enemies appeared to find allies in the Trump administration, including the president's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani. The former envoy's supporters say she was also smeared by US conservative media voices. In her testimony, Ms Yovanovitch said the allegation she was disloyal to Mr Trump was false. The US president is accused of withholding US military aid to pressure Ukraine into investigating his domestic political rival. At the heart of the impeachment inquiry is a phone call on 25 July this year between Mr Trump and Ukraine's newly elected president. This video can not be played Sondland was involved in a ""domestic political errand"" for Trump On the call, Mr Trump urged his counterpart to look into unsubstantiated corruption claims against Democratic White House contender Joe Biden. Mr Trump's critics say this alleged political pressure on a vulnerable US ally amounted to abuse of power. UK coal miner's daughter turned White House aide The president spent a significant portion of Friday's television interview discussing a conspiracy theory that it was Ukraine - not Russia - meddling in the US 2016 presidential election. These claims were branded ""a fictional narrative"" by one of Thursday's impeachment witnesses, former White House intelligence official and Russia expert Fiona Hill. She warned elected officials not to promote ""politically driven falsehoods"" that seek to cast doubt on Russia's alleged interference in US elections. Three Republican impeachment claims, fact-checked For almost an hour on Fox News, Donald Trump shared conspiracy theories about Ukrainian meddling in the 2016 US presidential election, again attacked a decorated former US ambassador and suggested a foreign service officer at the US embassy in Ukraine was lying under oath. And those were just the bullet-point highlights. It was yet further evidence that the president's take diverges entirely from the testimony of witnesses in the public impeachment hearings and the accounts reported in the mainstream US media. Mr Trump, for instance, was adamant that a 26 July phone call between himself and Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the EU who was in Kiev at the time, ""never took place"". It was during this call - confirmed by Mr Sondland himself - that witness David Holmes testified on Thursday that the president asked about Ukrainian ""investigations"" the day after Mr Trump had told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Democratic rival Joe Biden. Critics will pick apart the president's comments, but if there's one thing clear after nearly three years of this presidency, when Mr Trump asserts his defence repeatedly and vociferously, his supporters and the Republican party back him up, no matter what fact-checkers may say. After sprinting through seven public hearings with 12 witnesses over five days, the House of Representatives' Intelligence Committee is now writing a report to submit to the Judiciary Committee. The Judiciary Committee is expected to begin drafting articles of impeachment - which are the charges of wrongdoing against the president - in early December. After a vote in the Democratic-controlled House, a trial would be held in the Republican-run Senate. If Mr Trump was convicted by a two-thirds majority - an outcome deemed highly unlikely - he would become the first US president to be removed from office through impeachment.

The fire service said the blaze took hold ""very quickly"" Simon Palmer, who works at the neighbouring Pier Hotel, said the Claremont was ""engulfed in flames"" and added the fire had ""taken three-quarters of the roof away already"".

"This video can not be played Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage makes election pitch Nigel Farage has unveiled the Brexit Party's general election policies, promising a ""political revolution that puts ordinary people first"". The party leader pledged to halve the foreign aid budget, abolish the House of Lords and cap permanent immigration at 50,000 a year. The Brexit Party is running in 275 seats, after deciding to stand down in the 317 won by the Tories in 2017. It is also promising a ""clean break"" from all EU institutions. LIVE: Latest updates from the election campaign How much does a general election cost? What are the Brexit Party's key policies? Speaking in London, Mr Farage said his party would scrap VAT on fuel bills and stop companies earning less than Â£10,000 a year paying corporation tax. He promised millions of trees would be planted to absorb carbon emissions. Mr Farage said his party would save tens of billions of pounds by redirecting foreign aid, scrapping the HS2 rail project and stopping the UK's contributions to the EU. He also claimed the party could recover Â£7bn from the UK's share of capital at the European Investment Bank. Mr Farage said he favoured making civil servants sign a ""pledge of political neutrality"" and devising ""political guidelines"" for the Supreme Court. He added that any Brexit Party MPs elected would ""hold Boris Johnson to his word"" over Brexit, and act as ""new radicals"" in Parliament to ""change politics for good"". Mr Farage accused the Conservatives of having ""no intention"" of reducing immigration numbers, as firms that supported them wanted ""cheap labour"". ""We would very much want to get immigration numbers down to what for 60 years were very acceptable and very workable post-war levels,"" he said. ""Yes, I'm talking around about 50,000 people a year."" Mr Farage added that work permits would give ""flexibility"" to the system, as there was a difference between permanent settlement and allowing workers to come for a ""time-limited period"". Other pledges include:,external Introducing a ban on exporting waste to other countries for it to be burned Providing free ""base level"" broadband for deprived regions, and free wi-fi on all public transport Abolishing business rates for shops outside the M25, funded by a ""small online sales tax"" Scrapping all interest on student loans, and abolishing inheritance tax Phasing out the BBC licence fee Limiting postal voting to people who are elderly, infirm or overseas Several other political parties have launched traditional manifestos - outlining policy commitments for government - this week, but Mr Farage and his colleagues have declined to do so. The former UKIP leader, who is not standing as a candidate in the election, said manifestos were a ""means of telling people what they want to hear without ever having the genuine desire to implement them"". Instead, he said his party would be making a ""contract with the people,external"" containing a ""targeted set of deliverable pledges"". The Brexit Party has changed its tune on, yes, Brexit. Until a few weeks ago its leader, Nigel Farage was saying a no-deal Brexit was the ""only acceptable deal"". But this ""contract"" moves the goalposts. Gone is the criticism of Boris Johnson's withdrawal agreement - now the party simply promises there will be ""no extended transition period"" after Brexit. Without saying so explicitly in this document, the Brexit Party is warning that it will campaign to ensure Mr Johnson sticks to his promise not to extend the transition any further. Read more here Brexit:The Conservatives say they will deliver Brexit by the end of January 2020 under the terms of the PM's deal negotiated with the EU. The Liberal Democrats have vowed to cancel Brexit if elected as a majority government, or otherwise campaign for a referendum including the option of staying in the EU. Labour wants to renegotiate the PM's Brexit deal then put it to a referendum within six months, with the option of staying in the EU. The party has not said which side it would take in such a vote. The SNP wants Scotland to stay in the EU. Immigration:Labour has not set a target in its manifesto, but has pledged to regulate the labour market to stop the ""undercutting of wages and conditions"". For the Tories, Home Secretary Priti Patel has previously said overall immigration should come down, but not according to an ""arbitrary"" target. Boris Johnson has promised to reduce unskilled migration. The SNP says cutting immigration would damage the Scottish economy. Trees:The Conservatives have said they will plant 30 million trees a year by 2025 if they win the election. The Liberal Democrats have pledged to plant twice as many trees in the same period. Labour has promised an ""ambitious programme of tree planting"", including a forest of a million trees to help the NHS become carbon neutral.

"Barclays has become the latest big company to pull its support for Prince Andrew's business mentoring initiative. The bank joined firms including Standard Chartered and KPMG in cutting ties with Pitch@Palace, which provides start-ups with advice and contacts. There has been a growing backlash over a BBC Newsnight interview about the royal's friendship with convicted US sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The princeis stepping down from royal dutiesfor the ""foreseeable future"". Following Wednesday's statement confirming this, a variety of organisations have continued to announce the end of their association with the prince. The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra was among those on Friday to confirm he would no longer be its patron. Announcing its decision to cut ties with the Pitch@Palace, Barclays, which had been an official partner of the scheme, said: ""In light of the current situation, we have informed Pitch@Palace that going forward we will, regretfully, no longer be participating in the programme. ""Pitch@Palace has been historically highly successful in supporting entrepreneurs and job creation and we hope a way forward can be found that means they can continue this important work."" Prince Andrew with his former private secretary, Amanda Thirsk Earlier, it emerged the woman who organised the Duke of York's interview with the BBC about his links to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein has been moved from her role as the prince's private secretary followinghis withdrawal from royal duties. Amanda Thirsk, who has worked for the duke since 2012, will become chief executive of Pitch@Palace. It remains unclear what role the duke will have at Pitch@Palace, which he founded in 2014, moving forwards. A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman would not comment on reports the duke had stepped down from leading Pitch. She said: ""The duke will continue to work on Pitch and will look at how he takes this forward outside of his public duties, and outside of Buckingham Palace. ""We recognise there will be a period of time while this transition takes place."" BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell said the decision to move Ms Thirsk into her new role was part of a ""downscaling"" of the duke's office. The BBC understands there are no plans to recruit a replacement. Our correspondent added it was a demonstration of the Queen and Prince Charles acting ""very assertively when they perceived a reputational risk to the monarchy itself"". Newsnight producer Sam McAlister,who has been credited with securing the interview for the BBC,external, said Ms Thirsk was the person she was ""mostly dealing with"" during the negotiation process. She told GQ magazine,externalshe was ""extremely charming, well-informed, thorough and brilliant"". What do charities get from having a royal patron?

Prince Andrew has ""categorically"" denied having any sexual contact with her.

Prince Andrew stepping back from royal duties Letter casts doubt on when prince met Epstein Prince Andrew Pizza Express reviews suspended On Friday, the English National Ballet, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and London Metropolitan University all announced the prince would no longer be their patron, with immediate effect. Prince Andrew was pictured horse riding with the Queen on Friday Lawyers representing Epstein's accusers have also urged the prince to speak to US authorities about his former friendship with Epstein.

"Suspected IS fighters captured in Syria earlier this year With the decision by the United States to withdraw from its positions in northern Syria, and Turkish forces moving in, the fate of thousands of suspected Islamic State detainees remains unclear. The detainees and their families -  held by Kurdish-led forces - include foreigners from various parts of the world. The US has called on foreign states to repatriate their nationals, accusing European nations of refusing to do so. So, how many foreign nationals are being held by Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and have any countries taken them back? The families of suspected IS militants are being held at a number of camps for displaced people in northern Syria. By far the largest is at al-Hol. It is housing almost 70,000 people, more than 94% of them women and children, of whom 11,000 are foreign nationals. Additionally, the SDF says some 12,000 suspected IS fighters are held in seven prisons in north-east Syria, of whomabout 4,000 are estimated to be foreigners,external(that is, neither Syrian nor Iraqi). A US government report published in August hasa lower figure for foreign adult combatants held in northern Syria - 2,000, originating from 50 countries.,external A French woman walks with her child in a camp in northern Syria Of these, about 800 are from European nations while the rest are from the Middle East, north Africa or Asia. To put that into context, a study last year by King's College's International Centre for the Study of Radicalisationestimated more than 41,000 foreign nationals had joined IS in Iraq and Syria between April 2013 and June 2018.,external The United Nations has said countries should take responsibility for their own citizens unless they are to be prosecuted in Syria in accordance with international standards. Many countries have been reluctant to do so, worried about public opinion and the legal challenges of dealing with citizens who joined IS. The women and children no-one wants How do countries deal with IS returnees? What is Islamic State? Human Rights Watch has described government-facilitated repatriations of foreign nationals as ""piecemeal."" It says more than 1,200 foreign nationals - mainly children -have been repatriated from both Syria and Iraq to Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Russia, Kosovo, and Turkey.,external But other nations have taken back only very small numbers: France: 18 children US: 16 adults and children Germany: fewer than 10 Australia: eight children Sweden: seven children Norway: five children In some cases, foreign nationals have been transferred to Iraqi jurisdiction and tried in that country's courts. Earlier this year, four Frenchmen were sentenced to death in Iraqin a judicial process heavily criticised at the time. Some foreign governments have revoked citizenship to prevent the return of suspected IS members - for example in the case of Shamima Begum, from the UK, who is being held at an SDF-run camp in Syria. Far larger numbers of foreigners who joined IS are likely to have made their own way home before Kurdish-led forces captured the jihadists' last pocket of territory in March. The International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation estimates the numbers globally to be between 7,712 and 8,202. This includes both voluntary returns as well as government-facilitated repatriations, although it adds the latter are likely to be minimal. Joana Cook and Gina Vale, co-authors of the study, told BBC News: ""Many governments appear more willing to facilitate the return of minors, particularly vulnerable ones like orphans, than the return of adult detainees.""

"A group of orphaned British children caught up in the war in Syria have returned to the UK. The children, who are all from one family, are the first to be repatriated from the area of Syria once controlled by the Islamic State (IS) group. The Foreign Office was asked by the High Court to help them return. The court heard they arrived in London on Friday and were in good spirits, having met with members of their family who they had breakfast with. They were brought back to the UK at the request of relatives after they were made wards of court - meaning they were placed under supervision and protection of the High Court. The judge said it had been a complex and difficult operation. Mr Justice Keehan said the children had now gone to their family homes where they appeared settled and as happy as possible in difficult circumstances. UK to repatriate orphaned children from Syria The IS prisoners no-one wants The rise and fall of the Islamic State group Their return comes after pressure on the government - and with calls from aid agencies for all British children who survived the fall of IS to be returned to the UK. On Thursday, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the ""innocent"" children should ""never have been subjected to the horrors of war"". Mr Raab added: ""We have facilitated their return home because it was the right thing to do. ""Now they must be allowed the privacy and given the support to return to a normal life."" This video can not be played Is this the end for Islamic State? The fate of foreign IS fighters and other foreigners caught up in the conflict has been a key issue since the defeat of the extremist group was declared in March 2019. IS once controlled 88,000 sq km (34,000 sq miles) of territory stretching from western Syria to eastern Iraq. The UK had been reluctant to take back citizens from the area. Other countries including France, Denmark, Norway and Kazakhstan have brought children home. The United Nations has said countries should take responsibility for their own citizens unless they are to be prosecuted in Syria in accordance with international standards. Save The Children said the repatriation was a ""triumph of compassion in the face of cruelty,"" and that it would allow the youngsters to live full, happy lives. But Alison Griffin, head of humanitarian campaigns at the children's charity, said more work was needed. She added: ""There are still as many as 60 British children that remain stranded in appalling conditions and Syria's harsh winter will soon begin to bite. ""All are as innocent as those rescued today and our very real fear is that they won't all survive to see the spring. ""They must all be brought home before it is too late.""

"Twenty-two people were killed in the attack on 22 May 2017 Greater Manchester Police (GMP) has been accused of jeopardising the start of the public inquiry into the Manchester Arena bomb attack. The force was criticised for missing a deadline to provide statements from officers in command on the night of the May 2017 blast in which 22 people died. ""It has been a huge undertaking for GMP involving an enormous amount of material,"" said the force's barrister. The inquiry is due to begin on 6 April 2020. Twenty two people were killed and hundreds injured when a device was detonated at the end of an Ariana Grande concert on 22 May, 2017. The victims' inquests wereturned into a public inquiry in Octoberso that secret evidence could be heard behind closed doors. Paul Greaney QC, counsel to the inquiry, told the hearing there was a second problem with ""gaps"" in the 550 hours of radio transmission recordings from the night of the bombing provided by GMP. Twelve organisations have been asked to provide written statements to the inquiry's legal team. GMP was said to be the only one not to have met the deadline. Peter Weatherby QC, who is representing some of the bereaved families, said that they desperately wanted to have confidence in GMP but ""the sorry tale is frankly not good enough"". The chairman of the inquiry, Sir John Saunders, warned the police that if there was a delay to the inquiry there would be ""extremely extensive public criticism made of GMP"". He said it was ""simply not fair to the families or to Manchester in general"" but added ""no comments should be made about lack of candour until we see the statements."" Fiona Barton QC, representing GMP, apologised to families in court for the delay. One relative was heard to say that he did not accept the apology. ""This is not a piece of work GMP has sat on,"" she said. ""It's been a huge undertaking for GMP involving an enormous amount of material. GMP has done its best."" Ms Barton explained the statements had been delayed because the force had hundreds of officers on duty at the attack, and it had taken time to identify which ones should provide the evidence. She said they were now in the process of being provided. In relation to the missing radio recordings she explained that the force was undergoing a system update at the time of the bombing, and work was under way to find the audio.

"This video can not be played Grace Millaneâs father David paid tribute to his daughter and said her murder had ""ripped apart"" the family A man who strangled a British backpacker and hid her body inside a suitcase has been found guilty of murder. Grace Millane was found buried in bushland outside Auckland, New Zealand. A jury at the city's high court rejected claims by the 27-year-old man, who cannot be named, that she died accidentally during ""rough sex"". Ms Millane's parents David and Gillian wept in the public gallery as jurors convicted their daughter's killer. The murder trial that gripped a nation He showed no emotion as the verdict - reached after about five hours of deliberations - was read out. University of Lincoln graduate Grace Millane was on a round-the-world trip at the time of her death Justice Simon Moore said the defendant would be sentenced on 21 February next year. The identity of Grace Millane's murderer cannot be disclosed for now due to a court suppression order that bans media from naming and picturing him. The purpose in New Zealand courts is to protect people not yet proven guilty - but also to have a fairer trial by ensuring the jury is not prejudiced by media coverage. Images can also be withheld. Justice Simon Moore ordered that the suppression order which prevents naming the defendant would remain in place indefinitely until lifted by the court. Mr and Mrs Millane, who had flown to New Zealand to attend the trial, said the verdict would be ""welcomed by every member of the family and friends of Grace"". Her family described Miss Millane as ""our sunshine"" Speaking outside the court, an emotional Mr Millane said the family's lives had been ""ripped apart"" by his daughter's ""barbaric"" murder. ""Grace was our sunshine and she will be missed forever,"" he said. Jurors heard the defendant and Ms Millane had met via the Tinder dating app on 1 December last year, the night before Ms Millane's 22nd birthday. They spent several hours drinking cocktails in bars around Auckland before going to the defendant's hotel. In the hours before she disappeared Miss Millane and the defendant were seen in the Sky City Development Ms Millane, from Wickford, Essex, was found in the mountainous WaitÄkere Ranges a week later. Suspect 'went on date while body in room' CCTV 'shows accused wheeling body in suitcase' 'Solo backpacking didn't kill Grace' Prosecutors said post-mortem examinations found bruises ""consistent with restraint"" on her body, and that she had been strangled. On the night of her death, the court heard, the defendant ""wasn't distressed or concerned by her death"", and set about making plans to dispose of her remains. He ""sexualised"" the killing by searching for pornography, stopping at one point to take lewd photos of her corpse, prosecutors said. This video can not be played Grace Millane's last movements were captured on CCTV The following day, he went on a Tinder date with another woman while the body of Ms Millane remained in the hotel room. He had bought a second suitcase in a bid to cover his tracks, as well as cleaning products and a shovel, jurors heard. The defendant did not give evidence in his defence. The killer's identity is suppressed under New Zealand law Following the verdict, the step-brother of the murderer spoke to television station TVNZ reporter Paul Hobbs. The man, who also cannot be named for legal reasons, said he initially thought Miss Millane's death could have been an accident but when he saw the timeline of events, his view changed. His step-brother, he said, was ""a pathological liar that lies over pointless things and continues to lie until the point where he's got no out - absolutely no out -  and then he just breaks down and cries and runs away. ""It's just absolutely terrible that a life had to be lost because of it."" He said he did not think his step-brother intended to kill Grace, but said: ""In that moment he just kept goingâ¦ and he took Grace's life."" In an interview with police, shown during the trial, the defendant was seen to break down in tears. ""His tears, to me, they're more tears for himself."" Apologising to the Millane family, he added: ""I'm just so, so incredibly sorry for their loss. ""To know it's one of our family members - even though it's not our actions - it's very difficult, and I can't imagine the pain and hurt and what [the Millane family] had to go through for a court hearingâ¦ to me that's all because he doesn't have any shred of a decent human being inside him, and couldn't just confess to the fact he murdered her."" Tinder said it was ""deeply saddened"" by the case and ""its thoughts were with the victim's loved ones"". A spokesperson added that it was not planning to review its policies in the light of the murder but said ""the safety of our members is a top priority"" and that they were exploring new updates and technologies to enhance its safety efforts around the world. Ms Millane's death prompted an outpouring of public grief in New Zealand with the country's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern apologising to her family.

"Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer came out fighting with a speech that secured the support of both her party and her chief critic Angela Merkel's would-be successor as German chancellor has threatened to stand down as leader of the CDU if her centre-right party fails to back her. Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, known as AKK, urged critics to support her vision for Germany at the party's annual congress in Leipzig. She has faced mounting criticism since replacing Mrs Merkel as CDU leader. However, her threat to resign prompted a lengthy ovation and a pledge of loyalty from her main critic. Poor election results and her low popularity have led to discontent within the CDU. But in a speech on Friday, Ms Kramp-Karrenbauer, 57, issued an ultimatum to her opponents. ""If you are of the opinion that the Germany I want is not the one you want... then let's end it. Here, now and today,"" Ms Kramp-Karrenbauer told delegates. ""But, dear friends, if you want this Germany, if you want to take this path together... then let's roll up our sleeves here and now and make a start."" Is Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer Merkel 2.0? Merkel bids emotional farewell to party Germany country profile At the end of the speech, delegates gave the party leader a standing ovation that lasted at least three minutes. Mrs Merkel, who also gave a speech at the congress, struck a more conciliatory tone, calling for party unity. Ms Kramp-Karrenbauer replaced Angela Merkel as CDU leader in December 2018 As leader of the Christian Democratic Union - Germany's largest party - Ms Kramp-Karrenbauer is favourite to succeed Mrs Merkel when she stands down in 2021. She was also given the role of defence minister during the summer, but shocked colleagues when she suggested sending German soldiers to northern Syria as part of a an international security zone. Friedrich Merz, a millionaire lawyer who narrowly lost out to Ms Kramp-Karrenbauer in last year's leadership vote, recently described the CDU-led government as ""abysmal"". He remains one of Ms Kramp-Karrenbauer's most vociferous critics but applauded her speech and promised loyalty. ""We are loyal, to our chairwoman, and to the government,"" he said. The warm, savoury smell of lunch began to waft into the conference centre. Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer had been speaking for an hour and, as stomachs rumbled, her audience began to look a little restless. But Angela Merkel looked on approvingly as the woman she backs as her successor as party leader and, potentially, chancellor, suddenly delivered a defiant challenge to her critics and the man who's been snapping at her heels for months. The powerful - and lengthy - standing ovation which followed suggests she has the backing of her party - for now. But privately delegates confide that they're still not sure. AKK is seen as a continuity candidate, her greatest strength or her greatest weakness, depending on who you ask. Polls also suggest she doesn't have the public's confidence. It's clear Friedrich Merz, who later gave a confident and rousing speech, still considers himself to be in the running. AKK will have to tread carefully. There are two years before Mrs Merkel is due to stand down and, besides Mr Merz, a number of others nurture ambitions for the top job. They're just waiting, some more quietly than others, for the right moment to make their move. Mrs Merkel has been chancellor since 2005 but with her fourth consecutive term due to end in December 2021, party turmoil has thrown AKK's candidacy into doubt. Earlier this year, she wasforced to dismiss a report that she believed Ms Kramp-Karrenbauer was not up to the job. Since then, a fractious debate about the political direction of the party has escalated. This video can not be played How Angela Merkel rose to power to lead Germany AfD overtakes Merkel's CDU in Thuringia The right-wing nationalists shaking up Europe In the European Parliament elections in May, the conservative bloc had its worse result since World War Two. The CDU and its sister party, the Christian Social Union, finished on top but support fell to 28.9% - down more than 7% from the last election four years ago. Then, in October, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) beat the CDU into third place in the eastern German state of Thuringia. Popular in Berlin and her home state of Saarland in the south-west, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer has a reputation for calm analysis and political acumen. She joined the party as a student in 1981 and quickly rose up the ranks of state politics, becoming the first woman to serve as a state minister for internal affairs in 2000, and the first woman to serve as prime minister of Saarland.Merkel successor threatens to quit as party leader Allow Twitter content?

A Merkel loyalist, she is expected to replicate much of the chancellor's style and policy. She has differentiated herself from her mentor, however, by voting in favour of quotas for women on corporate boards and by taking a tougher line on Russia. She is also more conservative on social issues like gay marriage, and has vowed to review the country's position on security and migration.

"This video can not be played Corbyn: ""I will adopt a neutral stance on Brexit"" Jeremy Corbyn has said he would remain neutral in a future Brexit referendum if Labour wins power. He told a BBC Question Time leaders' special he would not campaign for Leave or Remain so it would allow him, as prime minister, to ""credibly"" carry out what the voters then decide. Prime Minister Boris Johnson later asked how Mr Corbyn could be ""indifferent"" on such a vital issue. But Mr Johnson faced questions of his own about whether he could be trusted. The prime minister was the fourth party leader to answer the audience's questions, with the SNP's Nicola Sturgeon and Liberal Democrat Jo Swinson also taking to the stage for 30 minutes each on Friday evening. Pressed on whether politicians should be relied upon to tell the truth, Mr Johnson said this was ""absolutely vital"". While trust was a crucial issue for voters, he argued the biggest threat to public confidence was the ""corrosive"" effect of Parliament trying to block Brexit. Fact-checking the leaders' debate Kuenssberg: No comfortable ride for the party leaders Five standout moments Live: Reaction to Question Time special He said the Labour, SNP and Lib Dem leaders wanted to ""basically frustrate"" the result of the 2016 referendum, which the public had been waiting more than three years to see delivered, by ""absurdly"" holding another one. He said that the Labour leader's views seemed to have ""mutated"" and Mr Corbyn's ambition to negotiate an improved agreement would be totally undermined if he did not care whether the public backed it or not. ""He is now going to be neutral on the deal he proposes to do. I don't see how he can do a deal when he is going to be neutral or indifferent."" This video can not be played Watch highlights from the Question Time leaders' special The four leaders all appeared individually and faced a mixture of audience questions and follow-up questions from host Fiona Bruce at the event in Sheffield. The first to take the stage, Mr Corbyn, faced tough questioning about his economic polices, with one member of the audience suggesting his ""reckless socialist"" agenda ""terrified"" him and his family. The Labour leader said his plans to take Royal Mail, the railways, the water industry and broadband delivery into public ownership had been ""set out"" very clearly and were aimed at ""delivering an economy that works for all"". He insisted business had ""nothing to be frightened of"" by his plans, saying his ""fully prepared and costed manifesto"" would bring the country together and help reduce inequality. Mr Corbyn was criticised for what several audience members suggested was a lack of clarity on whether he personally would support or oppose Brexit in a new referendum in 2020, with one questioner saying: ""Why would anyone vote for Labour without knowing the answer to that question?"" Mr Corbyn said it was ""entirely reasonable"" to put the question back to the people as another referendum represented a sensible middle ground between those who wanted to cancel Brexit entirely and those backing the PM's deal. Asked to clarify his own position, he said: ""I will adopt, if I am prime minister at the time, a neutral stance so I can credibly carry out the results of that to bring our communities and countries together rather than continuing an endless debate."" He later told the audience: ""You heard it here first on Question Time."" REALITY CHECK:Leaders' claims scrutinised VIDEO:The best bits, in three minutes FIVE MOMENTS:The key takeaways ANALYSIS:Laura Kuenssberg's take TWITTER REACTION:Audience gains social media respect In doing this, he would follow in the footsteps of Harold Wilson - who allowed Labour ministers to campaign on both sides in the 1975 Common Market referendum and took a back seat during the campaign - although he personally backed staying in. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Health Secretary Matt Hancock attacked Mr Corbyn's position, saying he had ""decided to be indecisive"" and it ""won't wash with the voters"". But shadow employment rights secretary Laura Pidcock defended Mr Corbyn's stance as ""brave"". ""What we are saying is we trust the people to have the final say,"" she told Today. It's not clear if the lively grilling of major politicians will shift the dial at this election. But it certainly marked a shift in Jeremy Corbyn's position on Brexit. He had been put under pressure by his opponents to say whether he would support Leave or Remain in the new referendum Labour is promising. So he tried to eliminate a negative by providing clarity, of a sort: a clear commitment to stay neutral. Labour's strategists are suggesting he could now be seen as an honest broker that can bring a divided country together. In truth, though, behind the scenes there are fears that the party may have over-estimated the threat from the Lib Dems and underestimated the importance voters in Leave areas attach to delivering Brexit. So his neutrality is in part an attempt to reassure those voters that his promised referendum isn't the means of cancelling Brexit by the back door. His followers will say he has risen above the fray; his critics - that he has become more decisive about sitting on the fence. Questioned on the issue of tackling incidents of anti-Semitism in the Labour Party, Mr Corbyn was accused of failing to intervene when one of his own Jewish MPs, Ruth Smeeth, was heckled by an activist at a party event in 2016. Mr Corbyn said Ms Smeeth and others had ""suffered terrible abuse"". He insisted that all forms of racism and misogyny were ""unacceptable"" and party activists who had abused MPs had been disciplined or expelled. When Mr Johnson took the stage, he dismissed suggestions he was trying to suppress the findings of a report into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 referendum vote as ""Bermuda triangle stuff"". ""There is no evidence whatsoever, that I know of, to show any interference in any British electoral event,"" the Conservative leader said. He insisted his party had ""zero tolerance"" towards Islamophobia and said he regretted any offence he had caused in articles about race during his journalistic career - including a piece in 2018 in which he likened Muslim women wearing burqas to letter boxes and bank robbers. But he defended the right to freedom of speech and did not accept an audience member's invitation to say ""sorry"" for writing them. Labour's economic plans would be ""ruinous"" for the country, he argued, but he also acknowledged his plan to cut national insurance bills for low-earners - expected to be the main tax announcement in the Conservative manifesto - would only have a modest impact. On the NHS, Mr Johnson stuck by his claims that the health service was receiving the biggest cash injection in its history. He added: ""Of course I understand that things have been tough in the NHS and understand the pressures the NHS is under. I know the massive demand the NHS faces but we can only meet that demand if we have a dynamic economy."" The SNP's Nicola Sturgeon said voting for her party in Scotland was the best way of ""depriving"" the Tories of a majority across the UK. Asked about what she would do in the event of another hung Parliament on 12 December, she said she would not work with the Tories but was prepared to deal with Labour if Jeremy Corbyn committed to end austerity and agreed to hold another Scottish independence referendum. This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon challenged over Scottish independence plans ""In terms of what I would seek to win from a minority Labour government, obviously I would ask for and expect Jeremy Corbyn to respect the right of the Scottish people to choose their own future. ""It is not for Westminster to decide. It is for the people of Scotland."" When it was pointed out to her that Mr Corbyn had just stated to viewers that he would not sanction another independence referendum in the first two years of a Labour government, she said she was predicting what he might choose to do after the election, rather than dwelling on what he was saying now. She said: ""Do you think he's going to walk away from the chance to end austerity, to protect the NHS, stop Universal Credit, simply because he wants, for a couple of years, to prevent Scotland having the right to self-determination?"" The first minister said more needed to be done to reduce the number of drug deaths in Scotland, saying, ""I don't want to be citizen of a country where people are dying from drug issues."" Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson was immediately asked by an audience member whether she regretted saying she could become prime minister and ""how ridiculous this sounded"" - given that her party only had 20 MPs at the end of the last Parliament. She said she recognised it was a ""big ask"" for her to make it to No 10 but she believed many people were ""dismayed"" at having to choose between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn and there had to be a ""better alternative"". This video can not be played Jo Swinson: Lib Dems 'being very straightforward' on Brexit She faced awkward questions over her plans to cancel Brexit by revoking Article 50, being asked by one audience member whether she regarded all 17.4 million Leave voters as ""stupid"". Ms Swinson said this was not the case and they clearly disagreed over the benefits of being in the EU, to which she was told ""you can disagree with me but you lost"". She was also challenged over austerity and what one audience member called her party's backing for ""harsh and cruel benefit cuts"" while in coalition with the Conservatives between 2010 and 2015. She conceded the Lib Dems had made mistakes during their time in government and should have done more to limit the scale of austerity - although she said she remained supportive of the principle of the Universal Credit system - which Labour has pledged to scrap. It was not a comfortable ride for any of the four who appeared in front of the audience in Sheffield who were pressed on issues as broad as the economy, austerity, Brexit, Bolivia, the Russia report, racism, the NHS and plenty more. It was particularly uncomfortable for the Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, who was pummelled by the audience over her promise to stop Brexit by simply halting the process altogether in the unlikely event she won a majority. There were moments of real challenge too for Boris Johnson first on a very simple question - can he be trusted? The audience's attitude made it clear they have a big question about that, and about him. Read more from Laura here. The two-hour show came after recently-screened Question Time specials withBrexit Party leader Nigel FarageandGreen Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley.

"This video can not be played Grace Millaneâs father David paid tribute to his daughter and said her murder had ""ripped apart"" the family A man who strangled a British backpacker and hid her body inside a suitcase has been found guilty of murder. Grace Millane was found buried in bushland outside Auckland, New Zealand. A jury at the city's high court rejected claims by the 27-year-old man, who cannot be named, that she died accidentally during ""rough sex"". Ms Millane's parents David and Gillian wept in the public gallery as jurors convicted their daughter's killer. The murder trial that gripped a nation He showed no emotion as the verdict - reached after about five hours of deliberations - was read out. University of Lincoln graduate Grace Millane was on a round-the-world trip at the time of her death Justice Simon Moore said the defendant would be sentenced on 21 February next year. The identity of Grace Millane's murderer cannot be disclosed for now due to a court suppression order that bans media from naming and picturing him. The purpose in New Zealand courts is to protect people not yet proven guilty - but also to have a fairer trial by ensuring the jury is not prejudiced by media coverage. Images can also be withheld. Justice Simon Moore ordered that the suppression order which prevents naming the defendant would remain in place indefinitely until lifted by the court. Mr and Mrs Millane, who had flown to New Zealand to attend the trial, said the verdict would be ""welcomed by every member of the family and friends of Grace"". Her family described Miss Millane as ""our sunshine"" Speaking outside the court, an emotional Mr Millane said the family's lives had been ""ripped apart"" by his daughter's ""barbaric"" murder. ""Grace was our sunshine and she will be missed forever,"" he said. Jurors heard the defendant and Ms Millane had met via the Tinder dating app on 1 December last year, the night before Ms Millane's 22nd birthday. They spent several hours drinking cocktails in bars around Auckland before going to the defendant's hotel. In the hours before she disappeared Miss Millane and the defendant were seen in the Sky City Development Ms Millane, from Wickford, Essex, was found in the mountainous WaitÄkere Ranges a week later. Suspect 'went on date while body in room' CCTV 'shows accused wheeling body in suitcase' 'Solo backpacking didn't kill Grace' Prosecutors said post-mortem examinations found bruises ""consistent with restraint"" on her body, and that she had been strangled. On the night of her death, the court heard, the defendant ""wasn't distressed or concerned by her death"", and set about making plans to dispose of her remains. He ""sexualised"" the killing by searching for pornography, stopping at one point to take lewd photos of her corpse, prosecutors said. This video can not be played Grace Millane's last movements were captured on CCTV The following day, he went on a Tinder date with another woman while the body of Ms Millane remained in the hotel room. He had bought a second suitcase in a bid to cover his tracks, as well as cleaning products and a shovel, jurors heard. The defendant did not give evidence in his defence. The killer's identity is suppressed under New Zealand law Following the verdict, the step-brother of the murderer spoke to television station TVNZ reporter Paul Hobbs. The man, who also cannot be named for legal reasons, said he initially thought Miss Millane's death could have been an accident but when he saw the timeline of events, his view changed. His step-brother, he said, was ""a pathological liar that lies over pointless things and continues to lie until the point where he's got no out - absolutely no out -  and then he just breaks down and cries and runs away. ""It's just absolutely terrible that a life had to be lost because of it."" He said he did not think his step-brother intended to kill Grace, but said: ""In that moment he just kept goingâ¦ and he took Grace's life."" In an interview with police, shown during the trial, the defendant was seen to break down in tears. ""His tears, to me, they're more tears for himself."" Apologising to the Millane family, he added: ""I'm just so, so incredibly sorry for their loss. ""To know it's one of our family members - even though it's not our actions - it's very difficult, and I can't imagine the pain and hurt and what [the Millane family] had to go through for a court hearingâ¦ to me that's all because he doesn't have any shred of a decent human being inside him, and couldn't just confess to the fact he murdered her."" Tinder said it was ""deeply saddened"" by the case and ""its thoughts were with the victim's loved ones"". A spokesperson added that it was not planning to review its policies in the light of the murder but said ""the safety of our members is a top priority"" and that they were exploring new updates and technologies to enhance its safety efforts around the world. Ms Millane's death prompted an outpouring of public grief in New Zealand with the country's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern apologising to her family.

"This video can not be played Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage makes election pitch Nigel Farage has unveiled the Brexit Party's general election policies, promising a ""political revolution that puts ordinary people first"". The party leader pledged to halve the foreign aid budget, abolish the House of Lords and cap permanent immigration at 50,000 a year. The Brexit Party is running in 275 seats, after deciding to stand down in the 317 won by the Tories in 2017. It is also promising a ""clean break"" from all EU institutions. LIVE: Latest updates from the election campaign How much does a general election cost? What are the Brexit Party's key policies? Speaking in London, Mr Farage said his party would scrap VAT on fuel bills and stop companies earning less than Â£10,000 a year paying corporation tax. He promised millions of trees would be planted to absorb carbon emissions. Mr Farage said his party would save tens of billions of pounds by redirecting foreign aid, scrapping the HS2 rail project and stopping the UK's contributions to the EU. He also claimed the party could recover Â£7bn from the UK's share of capital at the European Investment Bank. Mr Farage said he favoured making civil servants sign a ""pledge of political neutrality"" and devising ""political guidelines"" for the Supreme Court. He added that any Brexit Party MPs elected would ""hold Boris Johnson to his word"" over Brexit, and act as ""new radicals"" in Parliament to ""change politics for good"". Mr Farage accused the Conservatives of having ""no intention"" of reducing immigration numbers, as firms that supported them wanted ""cheap labour"". ""We would very much want to get immigration numbers down to what for 60 years were very acceptable and very workable post-war levels,"" he said. ""Yes, I'm talking around about 50,000 people a year."" Mr Farage added that work permits would give ""flexibility"" to the system, as there was a difference between permanent settlement and allowing workers to come for a ""time-limited period"". Other pledges include:,external Introducing a ban on exporting waste to other countries for it to be burned Providing free ""base level"" broadband for deprived regions, and free wi-fi on all public transport Abolishing business rates for shops outside the M25, funded by a ""small online sales tax"" Scrapping all interest on student loans, and abolishing inheritance tax Phasing out the BBC licence fee Limiting postal voting to people who are elderly, infirm or overseas Several other political parties have launched traditional manifestos - outlining policy commitments for government - this week, but Mr Farage and his colleagues have declined to do so. The former UKIP leader, who is not standing as a candidate in the election, said manifestos were a ""means of telling people what they want to hear without ever having the genuine desire to implement them"". Instead, he said his party would be making a ""contract with the people,external"" containing a ""targeted set of deliverable pledges"". The Brexit Party has changed its tune on, yes, Brexit. Until a few weeks ago its leader, Nigel Farage was saying a no-deal Brexit was the ""only acceptable deal"". But this ""contract"" moves the goalposts. Gone is the criticism of Boris Johnson's withdrawal agreement - now the party simply promises there will be ""no extended transition period"" after Brexit. Without saying so explicitly in this document, the Brexit Party is warning that it will campaign to ensure Mr Johnson sticks to his promise not to extend the transition any further. Read more here Brexit:The Conservatives say they will deliver Brexit by the end of January 2020 under the terms of the PM's deal negotiated with the EU. The Liberal Democrats have vowed to cancel Brexit if elected as a majority government, or otherwise campaign for a referendum including the option of staying in the EU. Labour wants to renegotiate the PM's Brexit deal then put it to a referendum within six months, with the option of staying in the EU. The party has not said which side it would take in such a vote. The SNP wants Scotland to stay in the EU. Immigration:Labour has not set a target in its manifesto, but has pledged to regulate the labour market to stop the ""undercutting of wages and conditions"". For the Tories, Home Secretary Priti Patel has previously said overall immigration should come down, but not according to an ""arbitrary"" target. Boris Johnson has promised to reduce unskilled migration. The SNP says cutting immigration would damage the Scottish economy. Trees:The Conservatives have said they will plant 30 million trees a year by 2025 if they win the election. The Liberal Democrats have pledged to plant twice as many trees in the same period. Labour has promised an ""ambitious programme of tree planting"", including a forest of a million trees to help the NHS become carbon neutral.

"Sana Muhammad, formerly known as Devi Unmathallegadoo, was nine months pregnant when she was killed A man who shot dead his heavily pregnant ex-wife with a crossbow has been found guilty of murder. Sana Muhammad was shot through the abdomen by Ramanodge Unmathallegadoo at her home in Ilford, east London, in November 2018. He hid in a shed in his ex-partner's garden armed with two crossbows, bolts, a knife, duct tape, cable ties and a hammer, the Old Bailey heard. Mrs Muhammad's son - her sixth child -was delivered by Caesarean section. Judge Mark Lucraft QC told Unmathallegadoo he had committed ""the most horrendous crime in the face of your own children"". Jurors heard Unmathallegadoo plotted the attack -  buying two crossbows which were discovered near his ex-wife's home by a neighbour in March 2018. After they were removed, he replaced the weapons and organised surveillance on the house in Applegarth Drive. Jurors heard the couple's relationship ended in 2012 and at the time of the attack, Unmathallegadoo was the subject of a court order which banned him from going within 100 metres of his ex's home. Ramanodge Unmathallegadoo murdered his pregnant ex-wife with a crossbow Mrs Muhammad's second husband Imtiaz told the court he was in the garden and thought he was ""dreaming"" when he saw the defendant step out of the shed with two crossbows. He shouted to his wife to run as Unmathallegadoo chased him into their home. ""When she got an arrow she just screamed. I was thinking, 'what is happening?', I was screaming for her."" In a victim impact statement he described her as ""my soul mate, my best friend, my wife, my companion and my everything and I love her dearly. ""Ram has finished everything. We all feel lost now"", he said. Her mother Ellemah (Joytee) Sutharamandoo said the loss of her only child had had a ""profound impact"". ""I lived for my daughter and my grandchildren. ""I now feel alone, there are days I do not want to live."" One of two crossbows used to kill Sana Muhammad Unmathallegadoo had denied murder and claimed he went to the house to talk to Mr Muhammad about his daughter's religion. He told police Mr Muhammad was his target but that his ex-wife got in the way. But the prosecution said Unmathallegadoo had wanted to kill the couple and their unborn child. The court heard Unmathallegadoo's children tried to take the crossbow from him. Susan Krikler, from the CPS, said: ""This was a cold-blooded and calculated execution. ""This devastating attack has left six children without their mother."" He will be sentenced next week. Mrs Muhammad who was born in Mauritius married the defendant when she was 16-years-old Unmathallegadoo first trial in April was discharged after a juror raised an issue about the defendant's mental health despite the judge asking the jury not to speculate on the matter.

"Grace Millane was last seen alive on the eve of her 22nd birthday Guilty. The intake of breath, a sob from the dead woman's mother. A single word was all it took to bring to an end one of the most highly publicised murder cases in New Zealand's history. Three weeks of evidence, hundreds of hours of painstaking police work and a year of grief for a family had built up to the moment 12 jurors agreed that a 27-year-old man had murdered Grace Millane. What had started out as a missing person inquiry in December 2018 when a daughter, sister and friend failed to respond to 22nd birthday messages swiftly turned into a murder investigation. When Ms Millane did not respond to birthday messages, her family issued an appeal on social media Within days of her disappearance, police had identified a suspect, spoken to him and, unbeknownst to the killer, tracked his movements by trawling through CCTV evidence. Before long police would find Ms Millane's body, which he had stuffed into a suitcase and buried in the mountainous WaitÄkere Ranges. There followed an outpouring of grief from a small nation unused to such crimes. The backpacker's body was discovered in bushland outside Auckland Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern issued an apology to Ms Millane's parents David and Gillian, saying ""your daughter should have been safe here, she wasn't and I'm sorry for that"". Ms Millane, from Wickford, Essex, and the man who would go on to murder her made contact through a dating app and hit it off immediately. She was in Auckland as part of a round-the-world trip, while he had been living there working in various sales jobs. It was clear from the footage they enjoyed each other's company; they were close, they kissed. Ms Millane even messaged a friend back home to tell her how much she was connecting with him. The pair were seen getting on well at various locations in the city They returned to his hotel. But after she left the lift, she was never seen alive again. They were seen in a lift, heading for the room where Ms Millane would be murdered There he strangled her before taking pictures of her and watching pornography. He claimed she had died accidentally during consensual sex. Despite his murder conviction, her killer still cannot be named. A court suppression order remains in place and is likely to do so beyond his sentencing on 21 February, in part because of the level of interest in the case. Reporting on the trial has proved challenging; because the defendant could not be named, CCTV footage had to be blurred, and there were legal disputes over some pieces of evidence. Several witnesses also had their identities protected. The killer's identity is suppressed under New Zealand law Because of the nature of the killer's defence, Ms Millane's parents have had to listen to claims about their daughter's sex life, with the details reported across New Zealand and around the world. Graphic information, in particular regarding the night of her murder, was analysed as Mr and Mrs Millane watched in court. At times, Mrs Millane would look at the floor or hold her head in her hands as the injuries inflicted on her daughter were described. The University of Lincoln graduate was on a round-the-world trip at the time of her death The prosecution accused the man of ""eroticising"" Ms Millane's death by taking intimate photographs of her body and looking up pornography while she lay dead in his room. In a way, he managed to do the same during her trial with his story about consensual sex gone wrong - a tale rejected by the jury - leading to a focus on BDSM and breath-play. Experts, Tinder dates and ex-lovers were all brought to court to talk about the killer and his victim. Man guilty of British backpacker's murder CCTV 'shows accused wheeling body in suitcase' Murder accused 'eroticised backpacker's death' The defendant was portrayed as a serial dater; he even messaged and met up with a woman as Ms Millane's body lay in a suitcase. It was the sexualising of the murder that brought the killer down. The timeline of his Google searches and the naked pictures of Ms Millane were irreconcilable with his case, the prosecution said. Either Ms Millane was dead when they were taken, or he had searched for the WaitÄkere Ranges, where he buried her body, while she was still living - thus showing he planned to kill her. The defence could only offer that they had been ""random"" drunk searches, and the WaitÄkere Ranges was perhaps somewhere the pair had planned to go for a day out. David and Gillian Millane attended the trial in Auckland The killer's right to use the ""rough sex"" defence, and some of the reporting of it, has angered Fiona Mackenzie, founder of the campaign group We Can't Consent To This. Describing it as the ""ultimate victim blaming"", she said: ""He gets to tell her story, he gets to tell the story of what she was like and how she asked for it. ""Families not only lose their loved one but these men [those who use such a defence] steal the public perception of them and destroy their reputation. It's appalling.""

"A group of orphaned British children caught up in the war in Syria have returned to the UK. The children, who are all from one family, are the first to be repatriated from the area of Syria once controlled by the Islamic State (IS) group. The Foreign Office was asked by the High Court to help them return. The court heard they arrived in London on Friday and were in good spirits, having met with members of their family who they had breakfast with. They were brought back to the UK at the request of relatives after they were made wards of court - meaning they were placed under supervision and protection of the High Court. The judge said it had been a complex and difficult operation. Mr Justice Keehan said the children had now gone to their family homes where they appeared settled and as happy as possible in difficult circumstances. UK to repatriate orphaned children from Syria The IS prisoners no-one wants The rise and fall of the Islamic State group Their return comes after pressure on the government - and with calls from aid agencies for all British children who survived the fall of IS to be returned to the UK. On Thursday, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the ""innocent"" children should ""never have been subjected to the horrors of war"". Mr Raab added: ""We have facilitated their return home because it was the right thing to do. ""Now they must be allowed the privacy and given the support to return to a normal life."" This video can not be played Is this the end for Islamic State? The fate of foreign IS fighters and other foreigners caught up in the conflict has been a key issue since the defeat of the extremist group was declared in March 2019. IS once controlled 88,000 sq km (34,000 sq miles) of territory stretching from western Syria to eastern Iraq. The UK had been reluctant to take back citizens from the area. Other countries including France, Denmark, Norway and Kazakhstan have brought children home. The United Nations has said countries should take responsibility for their own citizens unless they are to be prosecuted in Syria in accordance with international standards. Save The Children said the repatriation was a ""triumph of compassion in the face of cruelty,"" and that it would allow the youngsters to live full, happy lives. But Alison Griffin, head of humanitarian campaigns at the children's charity, said more work was needed. She added: ""There are still as many as 60 British children that remain stranded in appalling conditions and Syria's harsh winter will soon begin to bite. ""All are as innocent as those rescued today and our very real fear is that they won't all survive to see the spring. ""They must all be brought home before it is too late.""

"This video can not be played Jeane Freeman explains why health board is in ""special measures"" Glasgow's health board has been placed in ""special measures"" following the deaths of two children at the city's largest hospital. Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde would be escalated to stage four of the NHS Board Performance Escalation Framework. This means an oversight board will be put in place, chaired by chief nursing officer Prof Fiona McQueen. Ms Freeman said there were issues over infection prevention and control. The move was welcomed by opposition MSPs who had been calling for the government to take greater control of the board. Earlier this week Ms Freeman apologised to the parents of two patients who died in 2017 in the Royal Hospital for Children (RHC), which is part of the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital (QEUH) campus. The five-step process to keep Scotland's NHS boards in line Mother of hospital death boy: 'I've been ignored' Health secretary issues apology over child deaths In a letter to the Scottish Parliament's health and sport committee on Friday, she said there were ""ongoing issues"" over infection prevention, management and control at the hospitals. ""I have concluded that further action is necessary to support the board to ensure appropriate governance is in place to increase public confidence in these matters and therefore that for this specific issue the board will be escalated to stage four of our performance framework,"" she said. A stage four ranking means there are ""significant risks to delivery, quality, financial performance or safety"" and that senior level external support is required. In her letter, Ms Freeman said the escalation would ""ensure appropriate governance is in place to increase public confidence and strengthen current approaches that are in place to mitigate avoidable harms"". There will be specific support for infection prevention and control, communications and engagement. When asked whether she had lost confidence in the health board, Ms Freeman told BBC Scotland it was ""performing well"" in a number of areas. She said: ""In their clinical performance they provide excellent quality of care to patients across their area. ""But in this particular area of infection prevention and control and how they manage that, how they have governance around that, how they collect and use the data and in their engagement with patients and families - and by that I mean giving people the answers to their questions - there is significant room for improvement."" Scottish Labour MSP Anas Sarwar said the health secretary had taken the right course of action. ""The Glasgow health board is not fit for purpose, and this is a necessary step following the unforgiveable failings of senior management,"" he said. ""The focus now must be to tell parents, patients and the public the truth about infections at the hospital. ""I pay tribute to the brave whistleblowers who came forward to shine a light on the catastrophic failings in the hope that nothing like this can ever happen again."" The Queen Elizabeth University Hospital and the Royal Hospital for Children share a campus in the south of Glasgow The health boardand Ms Freeman have both apologised to the parents of two children who died at the hospital. Three-year-old Mason Djemat, who was being treated for a rare genetic disease, died on 9 August 2017. Milly Main, 10, died three weeks later while recovering from leukaemia treatment. Both children were treated on a ward affected by water contamination at the Royal Hospital for Children. Their deaths emerged after Mr Sarwar was contacted by a whistleblower. It also emerged on Friday that the NHS board has written to parents confirming that one of the wards affected will reopen for general admissions. It explained there was ""no evidence to support the continued restriction of new admissions"" in the ward, and that new parent and staff facilities would be provided.

"This video can not be played Amazon parcels 'lobbed' over gate in Derby (from December 2018) More than half of online shoppers experienced at least one delivery problem last Christmas, a Which? survey suggests. The most common complaint was orders arriving too early, meaning people were not at home to collect it. And around one in four people said their orders did not arrive at all. Other problems included deliveries being left in the rain for days and a woman who found a parcel in her toilet after it was pushed through a window. The survey, conducted by Populus forthe Which? consumer group,,externalasked 2,071 shoppers about their online orders between November 2018 and January 2019. It found 54% of people said they had at least one delivery that did not go to plan. 'My parcel was propping the window open' 'No address' gift delivered in Donegal Amazon parcel 'thrown through upstairs window' Nearly one in six people said their parcels arrived late, while 29% complained their delivery arrived earlier than expected so they were not there to accept it. Around a quarter of people said the courier did not follow pre-arranged instructions properly, meaning their deliveries were handed to unauthorised neighbours or left in unexpected places. One person complained that their delivery was left in the rain for 48 hours while they were away for the weekend. Meanwhile, nearly one in ten reported that a delivery driver had left a note claiming the recipient was not at home when they were. One shopper said that they received such a note after seeing the courier pass their home without attempting a delivery. Pippa Park was in less celebratory mood when a present for her sister went astray Pippa Park said she ordered a pair of Â£150 sunglasses online for her sister for Christmas last year. But the package was left in the recycling bin by the delivery company- just one hour before it was due to be emptied by the refuse collectors. ""I wanted to give the present to my sister before she went travelling and the delivery had already taken two weeks,"" said Pippa, who lives in London. She was refunded but said she was left feeling very frustrated by the incident. The glasses were recycled. Read more here Which? consumer rights spokesman Adam French said missing, late, or damaged deliveries can be a nightmare for shoppers. Retailers have a duty to ensure online orders are delivered within a reasonable time and in good condition, under the Consumer Rights Act, he said. However, he warned people to ""think very carefully"" about any instructions you leave for couriers. He added: ""But be aware if you give permission for your delivery to be left in a specified safe place, or received by a nominated neighbour, and something goes wrong, you will still be considered to have received the delivery.""

"This video can not be played Plaid promises to ""make our own Wales"" Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price has called for a Â£20bn ""green jobs revolution"" in Wales as he launched the party's general election manifesto. The 10-year plan includes rail and bus travel schemes, three tidal lagoons, a barrage and a new offshore wind farm. Mr Price said tens of thousands of ""green collar"" jobs can be created and the ""urgent climate emergency"" tackled. He said his party would also fight to remain in the EU in a ""final referendum"" on the UK's membership. ""We must defeat the negative, hope-crushing wrecking ball that is Brexit,"" he said. ""And if you want the people to have their final say then we must encourage as many of them to say loudly and clearly in the days ahead this Brexit is not for us, it never was and never will be."" Live: On the campaign trail Who is Adam Price? Key Plaid Cymru policies explained A simple guide to Plaid Cymru Election policy guide Mr Price said the party's green proposals would make Wales self-sustainable in renewable energy by 2030. Plaid Cymru later clarified that this meant electricity. ""Wales was the cradle of the first industrial revolution, but the sad truth known to all of us who live in Wales is that our country hasn't reaped the benefits of our own wealth,"" he told activists at the launch event at a college in Nantgarw, near Cardiff. ""We know that Wales has enormous potential - we are rich in natural resources and our people are talented and skilled. ""Just as we were the first time, we can be the cradle of another revolution - a green jobs revolution - creating tens of thousands of green collar jobs and seriously tackling the urgent climate emergency we face."" A new offshore wind farm is among the renewable energy projects proposed The green plan include: Electrification of all mainline rail lines, the south Wales Valley Lines and North Wales Coast railway A south east Wales ""super metro"" transport system, metro for Swansea Bay and the western valleys and for north east Wales Re-opening rail services in the Amman, Tawe, Neath, and Dulais valleys Building tidal lagoons in Swansea Bay, Cardiff and Colwyn Bay, an offshore wind farm off Anglesey and a barrage on the River Usk Building 20,000 green social houses and a Â£5bn home energy efficiency programme To pay for the plan, Plaid Cymru is calling for the UK government to devote an extra 1% ofGDP, a measure of the size of the economy, to green investment over 10 years, which the party says would give Wales a share worth Â£15bn. The party also says the Treasury should raise Wales' borrowing limit from Â£1bn to Â£5bn, to reach the Â£20bn total for green schemes. Since becoming Plaid Cymru leader a year ago, Mr Price has made achieving the goal of Welsh independence central to his message, predicting a referendum on the issue by 2030. During his speech, he said his party would bring about ""a Wales and a world that's cleaner and safer and fairer and better"". ""They say that our dream of an independent Wales is improbable, that our poverty is inevitable, well, this is the moment when the improbable beats what Westminster says is inevitable,"" he said. ""This is the moment when we start to believe that our future won't be written for us in the corridors of Westminster, or the streets of Whitehall but by us in the valleys and villages of a nation remade."" Another Brexit referendum to give the public a final say - the party backs remaining in the EU Give Wales control of migration policy so it can plug staff shortages in key sectors Free social care at the point of needas part of a new National Health and Social Care service, plus an extra 1,000 doctors, 5,000 nurses and 100 NHS dentists Universal free childcare for 40 hours a week anda Â£35 a week payment for every child in low income households Set up a Welsh justice system with powers over policing and therecruitment of 1,600 more police officers Drug law reform to be examined by a national commission, with a view that the current hard-line approach isn't working Devolution of corporation tax, air passenger duty and VAT Decisions to go to war should require the support of all four nations of the UK The tricky challenge for Plaid Cymru in this general election is how to position themselves against Labour as a party of the left that's got a more attractive offering to voters. With UK Labour publishing the most radical manifesto in a generation  - put to one side questions about its deliverability for a moment - there's no way Plaid could credibly outbid it in terms of spending promises. Especially since they can't form a government on December 13th - in fact many of the promises in their manifesto rely on them winning the Welsh Assembly election in 2021. So the tactic is to juxtapose UK Labour with Welsh Labour who've been in government in the assembly for 20 years - in other words, while Jeremy Corbyn can argue he's the agent of change in Westminster, Adam Price argues he's the one who's offering change in Wales, where Labour has dominated the political landscape for a century. What makes this election even more tricky is that while Plaid are trying to gain extra seats like Ynys Mon, two of the four seats they're defending have tiny majorities. The stakes are high for Plaid's leader, but the margins are very fine indeed. A number of other parties have already launched their manifestos: Labour promised ""real change"" with their ""radical"" plans, includingnationalisation projects, green jobs and more council homes The Lib Dems have promised a ""brighter future"" by stopping Brexit,as well as extra funding for the NHS and free childcare The Green Party has proposed to spend Â£100bn a year to cut emissions, along witha basic income for all and banning single use plastic Here's a concise guide to where the parties stand on key issues like Brexit, education and the NHS.

"The bodies were discovered early on 23 October in an industrial estate in Grays A man has been arrested in connection with the deaths of 39 people found in the back of a lorry in Essex. The bodieswere found in a refrigerated container in Thurrock on 23 October. A 23-year-old man from Northern Ireland was detained in the early hours of Friday on the M40 in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire. Essex Police said he would be questioned on suspicion of conspiracy to traffic people and conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration. The people found dead, who were from Vietnam, were eight women and 31 men. Ten teenagers, including two 15-year-old boys, were among the victims. Lorry driver Maurice Robinson, 25, has been charged with 39 counts of manslaughter.

The court heard that the UK authorities say Mr Harrison drove the truck with the refrigerated container to Zeebrugge in Belgium before it was collected in Essex by Craigavon driver Maurice Robinson.

"This video can not be played John McDonnell said the IFS had ""got it wrong this time"" The Institute for Fiscal Studies ""got it wrong"" when it described Labour's tax plans as ""not credible"", the shadow chancellor has said. John McDonnell rejected analysis by the independent research group that said the party's manifesto pledges required broader tax rises than it had outlined. He insisted 95% of people would pay no more tax than they do now. Mr McDonnell also denied the suggestion that raising corporation tax would mean wage cuts and higher prices. Labour's105-page general election page manifesto,externalpromises to ""transform the UK"" with a Â£75bn house building programme and the renationalisation of the railways, mail, water and energy - funded by tax increases on higher earners and reversing corporation tax cuts. The pledges would add Â£83bn to annual government spending by 2024. The IFS said there were ""risks"" with Labour's plans, with its director Paul Johnson adding: ""It will be extremely hard simply to deliver anything like this scale of increase in capital spending, at least in the near-term, certainly in an efficient and cost-effective way."" Kuenssberg: The manifesto Corbyn has always wanted What is in the Labour Party manifesto? Labour eyes 'radical' plan for companies Does Â£80,000 put you in the top 5% of earners? LIVE: Election campaign But Mr McDonnell told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I've a great deal of respect for the IFS... I just think they've got it wrong on this one. ""What we're saying is in terms of income tax, yes the top 5% will pay a bit more - and actually not a great deal more but they'll pay a bit more. The [other] 95% of earners will not pay an increase in the income tax rates or in VAT or in National Insurance."" He said Labour was proposing to ""reverse some of the corporation tax cuts that have been given away by the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats over the last 10 years"", but the rate would remain ""competitive"". The shadow chancellor added: ""With the structural changes we will make in the economy, we'll make sure that actually the corporations themselves do not take that easy option of cutting wages or rising prices, but actually because we're democratising the way these corporations work and are more accountable, they will actually invest in their companies. ""Instead of being driven by short-term profiteering and shareholder interest only, they will think for the long term, invest and grow the economy."" Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Mr McDonnell said the the IFS assessment had also been ""challenged by economists across the piece"". He also confirmed a Labour government would give workers the right to withdraw their labour alongside other striking unions. But questioned on whether this meant the party was planning to overturn legislation barring ""secondary picketing"" - where strikers go to the premises of a firm that trades with their employer, but is not otherwise involved in the dispute - Mr McDonnell said: ""No, no we're not.""

"This video can not be played Eastbourne's Claremont Hotel severely damaged by fire A Victorian seafront hotel has been ""engulfed in flames"" after a fire broke out in its basement. Eastbourne's Grade II* listed Claremont Hotel was evacuated after the blaze started at about 08:50 GMT. The Pier Hotel has also been evacuated. About 60 firefighters and 12 engines were sent to the scene. Six people have been treated for minor injuries, with one taken to hospital suffering from breathing difficulties, the ambulance service said. All those who were in the hotel when the fire started have been accounted for, East Sussex Fire and Rescue Service said. The fire at Claremont hotel started at about 08:50 GMT Nearby residents have been advised to keep windows and doors closed. Roads in the area have been shut. Flames spread from the basement of the Claremont and could be seen coming out of windows and the roof. ""The building has been seriously damaged and will need to be examined by building experts before a decision is made about its future,"" a fire service spokesman said. He said the fire had been brought under control and the fire service was ""scaling back the operation"". The owners of the hotel, Daish's Holidays, said the ""significant damage"" to the hotel was ""devastating"". The company said 130 guests and staff members had been in the building when the fire broke out. A spokesman said the hotel had arranged return travel home for all guests and was contacting guests who had future bookings. ""We are devastated at the loss of the hotel and will be working tirelessly to support everyone affected by the damage."" The fire service said the blaze took hold ""very quickly"" Simon Palmer, who works at the neighbouring Pier Hotel, said the Claremont was ""engulfed in flames"" and added the fire had ""taken three-quarters of the roof away already"". He said he heard a ""very loud explosion"" and thought parts of the hotel were collapsing. Many of the guests he had spoken to were having breakfast when the blaze started so were able to escape quickly, he said. Plumes of smoke have been seen coming from the building East Sussex Fire and Rescue Service said it was using seawater to deal with the fire Drug-drivers facing renewed Christmas crackdown 'My parents were told to plan my funeral' Lorry full of chocolate bursts into flames Guests Jenny and Alan Powell, from Cheltenham, in Gloucestershire, described ""a massive explosion"". Mrs Powell said: ""I thought a big window had blown out and then we realised it was more serious and the wall had blown away and there was debris everywhere."" Her husband said a few people were ""lying on the floor really shaken up"". This video can not be played Flames spread from the basement to the roof of the hotel Eastbourne hotelier Sheikh Abid Gulzar, who owned the Claremont for nine years until 2016, said it was ""very sad and very shocking"". He said: ""I had done lots of work on this building. I spent nearly Â£1m on refurbishments."" Assistant Chief Fire Officer Mark Andrews said: ""This is a very serious incident and the fire took hold very quickly. ""The swift actions of the hotel staff meant everyone got out of the hotel safely, and we thank them for their efforts."" Eastbourne Borough Council said 40 people had been looked after in the town hall, with most of them being residents of Elms Avenue who would be allowed to return home later on Friday. Others were staying at the Burlington Hotel and Afton Hotel, both of which were evacuated.

"The woman managed to give the dispatcher her address and answer questions by pretending to order a pizza (file picture) A woman in a domestic violence situation managed to call 911 without the perpetrator realising, by pretending to order a pizza. Officers in Oregon city, Ohio, praised the caller's quick thinking, which led to the alleged abuser being arrested. The unnamed woman told local media her mum was being attacked at the time. This tactic for subtly calling the emergency services has been internet lore for years, but this is a rare confirmed case of it being effective. Officials have previously warned that the strategy is not guaranteed to work, as dispatchers are not trained to recognise a pizza order as a genuine call for help. Russian domestic violence: Women fight back Stalking software is 'on the rise' Domestic abuse 'biggest child protection threat' The dispatcher who answered the call, Tim Teneyck, told local news station 13 ABC he initially thought the womanhad dialled an incorrect number,external. When she insisted she was through to the right person, he realised what was happening - partly because he had seen similar scenarios being shared on social media. ""You see it on Facebook, but it's not something that anybody has ever been trained for,"" Mr Teneyck said. ""Other dispatchers that I've talked to would not have picked up on this. They've told me they wouldn't have picked up on this."" Here's a transcript of the conversation. Mr Teneyck:Oregon 911 Caller:I would like to order a pizza at [address redacted]. Mr Teneyck:You called 911 to order a pizza? Caller:Uh, yeah. Apartment [redacted]. Mr Teneyck:This is the wrong number to call for a pizza... Caller:No, no, no. You're not understanding. Mr Teneyck:I'm getting you now. Later in the call, the woman found creative ways to answer Mr Teneyck's yes or no questions about how much danger she and her mother were in, and what services they needed. Mr Teneyck:Is the other guy still there? Caller:Yep, I need a large pizza. Mr Teneyck:All right. How about medical, do you need medical? Caller:No. With pepperoni. It is unclear where exactly the idea originated, but a very similar scenario was used in a campaign by the Norwegian Women's Shelter Association in 2010. Four years later, in May 2014, a user on discussion website Reddit claiming to be a 911 operator described a domestic abuse victim calling to order a pizza. They wrote that the call ""started out pretty dumb, but was actually pretty serious"" - before describing a conversation similar to the one Mr Tenyck had. A few months later a number of news sites reported on the Reddit post, and in 2015 it was even turned intoa Super Bowl ad addressing domestic abuse,external. The scenario later became a viral ""public service announcement"" on social media, with one Facebook post making the unsubstantiated claim that ""dispatchers are trained"" to recognise the pizza call as a call for help, and to ask specific questions. This claim was debunked last year. Christopher Carver, the dispatch centre operations director for the National Emergency Number Association in the US, told the Associated Press that police are not trained to listen out for any specific code words or scenarios. ""Setting any expectations of secret phrases that will work with any 911 centre is potentially very dangerous,"" he said, and recommended that people use 911's SMS service instead. But the ""Text to 911"" service is not available in all US locations, and is not functioning in Oregon city in Ohio. Mr Carver did say that dispatchers would not hang up on a caller. The priority, he added, is for callers to let the dispatcher know their location.

"This video can not be played Corbyn: ""I will adopt a neutral stance on Brexit"" Jeremy Corbyn has said he would remain neutral in a future Brexit referendum if Labour wins power. He told a BBC Question Time leaders' special he would not campaign for Leave or Remain so it would allow him, as prime minister, to ""credibly"" carry out what the voters then decide. Prime Minister Boris Johnson later asked how Mr Corbyn could be ""indifferent"" on such a vital issue. But Mr Johnson faced questions of his own about whether he could be trusted. The prime minister was the fourth party leader to answer the audience's questions, with the SNP's Nicola Sturgeon and Liberal Democrat Jo Swinson also taking to the stage for 30 minutes each on Friday evening. Pressed on whether politicians should be relied upon to tell the truth, Mr Johnson said this was ""absolutely vital"". While trust was a crucial issue for voters, he argued the biggest threat to public confidence was the ""corrosive"" effect of Parliament trying to block Brexit. Fact-checking the leaders' debate Kuenssberg: No comfortable ride for the party leaders Five standout moments Live: Reaction to Question Time special He said the Labour, SNP and Lib Dem leaders wanted to ""basically frustrate"" the result of the 2016 referendum, which the public had been waiting more than three years to see delivered, by ""absurdly"" holding another one. He said that the Labour leader's views seemed to have ""mutated"" and Mr Corbyn's ambition to negotiate an improved agreement would be totally undermined if he did not care whether the public backed it or not. ""He is now going to be neutral on the deal he proposes to do. I don't see how he can do a deal when he is going to be neutral or indifferent."" This video can not be played Watch highlights from the Question Time leaders' special The four leaders all appeared individually and faced a mixture of audience questions and follow-up questions from host Fiona Bruce at the event in Sheffield. The first to take the stage, Mr Corbyn, faced tough questioning about his economic polices, with one member of the audience suggesting his ""reckless socialist"" agenda ""terrified"" him and his family. The Labour leader said his plans to take Royal Mail, the railways, the water industry and broadband delivery into public ownership had been ""set out"" very clearly and were aimed at ""delivering an economy that works for all"". He insisted business had ""nothing to be frightened of"" by his plans, saying his ""fully prepared and costed manifesto"" would bring the country together and help reduce inequality. Mr Corbyn was criticised for what several audience members suggested was a lack of clarity on whether he personally would support or oppose Brexit in a new referendum in 2020, with one questioner saying: ""Why would anyone vote for Labour without knowing the answer to that question?"" Mr Corbyn said it was ""entirely reasonable"" to put the question back to the people as another referendum represented a sensible middle ground between those who wanted to cancel Brexit entirely and those backing the PM's deal. Asked to clarify his own position, he said: ""I will adopt, if I am prime minister at the time, a neutral stance so I can credibly carry out the results of that to bring our communities and countries together rather than continuing an endless debate."" He later told the audience: ""You heard it here first on Question Time."" REALITY CHECK:Leaders' claims scrutinised VIDEO:The best bits, in three minutes FIVE MOMENTS:The key takeaways ANALYSIS:Laura Kuenssberg's take TWITTER REACTION:Audience gains social media respect In doing this, he would follow in the footsteps of Harold Wilson - who allowed Labour ministers to campaign on both sides in the 1975 Common Market referendum and took a back seat during the campaign - although he personally backed staying in. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Health Secretary Matt Hancock attacked Mr Corbyn's position, saying he had ""decided to be indecisive"" and it ""won't wash with the voters"". But shadow employment rights secretary Laura Pidcock defended Mr Corbyn's stance as ""brave"". ""What we are saying is we trust the people to have the final say,"" she told Today. It's not clear if the lively grilling of major politicians will shift the dial at this election. But it certainly marked a shift in Jeremy Corbyn's position on Brexit. He had been put under pressure by his opponents to say whether he would support Leave or Remain in the new referendum Labour is promising. So he tried to eliminate a negative by providing clarity, of a sort: a clear commitment to stay neutral. Labour's strategists are suggesting he could now be seen as an honest broker that can bring a divided country together. In truth, though, behind the scenes there are fears that the party may have over-estimated the threat from the Lib Dems and underestimated the importance voters in Leave areas attach to delivering Brexit. So his neutrality is in part an attempt to reassure those voters that his promised referendum isn't the means of cancelling Brexit by the back door. His followers will say he has risen above the fray; his critics - that he has become more decisive about sitting on the fence. Questioned on the issue of tackling incidents of anti-Semitism in the Labour Party, Mr Corbyn was accused of failing to intervene when one of his own Jewish MPs, Ruth Smeeth, was heckled by an activist at a party event in 2016. Mr Corbyn said Ms Smeeth and others had ""suffered terrible abuse"". He insisted that all forms of racism and misogyny were ""unacceptable"" and party activists who had abused MPs had been disciplined or expelled. When Mr Johnson took the stage, he dismissed suggestions he was trying to suppress the findings of a report into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 referendum vote as ""Bermuda triangle stuff"". ""There is no evidence whatsoever, that I know of, to show any interference in any British electoral event,"" the Conservative leader said. He insisted his party had ""zero tolerance"" towards Islamophobia and said he regretted any offence he had caused in articles about race during his journalistic career - including a piece in 2018 in which he likened Muslim women wearing burqas to letter boxes and bank robbers. But he defended the right to freedom of speech and did not accept an audience member's invitation to say ""sorry"" for writing them. Labour's economic plans would be ""ruinous"" for the country, he argued, but he also acknowledged his plan to cut national insurance bills for low-earners - expected to be the main tax announcement in the Conservative manifesto - would only have a modest impact. On the NHS, Mr Johnson stuck by his claims that the health service was receiving the biggest cash injection in its history. He added: ""Of course I understand that things have been tough in the NHS and understand the pressures the NHS is under. I know the massive demand the NHS faces but we can only meet that demand if we have a dynamic economy."" The SNP's Nicola Sturgeon said voting for her party in Scotland was the best way of ""depriving"" the Tories of a majority across the UK. Asked about what she would do in the event of another hung Parliament on 12 December, she said she would not work with the Tories but was prepared to deal with Labour if Jeremy Corbyn committed to end austerity and agreed to hold another Scottish independence referendum. This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon challenged over Scottish independence plans ""In terms of what I would seek to win from a minority Labour government, obviously I would ask for and expect Jeremy Corbyn to respect the right of the Scottish people to choose their own future. ""It is not for Westminster to decide. It is for the people of Scotland."" When it was pointed out to her that Mr Corbyn had just stated to viewers that he would not sanction another independence referendum in the first two years of a Labour government, she said she was predicting what he might choose to do after the election, rather than dwelling on what he was saying now. She said: ""Do you think he's going to walk away from the chance to end austerity, to protect the NHS, stop Universal Credit, simply because he wants, for a couple of years, to prevent Scotland having the right to self-determination?"" The first minister said more needed to be done to reduce the number of drug deaths in Scotland, saying, ""I don't want to be citizen of a country where people are dying from drug issues."" Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson was immediately asked by an audience member whether she regretted saying she could become prime minister and ""how ridiculous this sounded"" - given that her party only had 20 MPs at the end of the last Parliament. She said she recognised it was a ""big ask"" for her to make it to No 10 but she believed many people were ""dismayed"" at having to choose between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn and there had to be a ""better alternative"". This video can not be played Jo Swinson: Lib Dems 'being very straightforward' on Brexit She faced awkward questions over her plans to cancel Brexit by revoking Article 50, being asked by one audience member whether she regarded all 17.4 million Leave voters as ""stupid"". Ms Swinson said this was not the case and they clearly disagreed over the benefits of being in the EU, to which she was told ""you can disagree with me but you lost"". She was also challenged over austerity and what one audience member called her party's backing for ""harsh and cruel benefit cuts"" while in coalition with the Conservatives between 2010 and 2015. She conceded the Lib Dems had made mistakes during their time in government and should have done more to limit the scale of austerity - although she said she remained supportive of the principle of the Universal Credit system - which Labour has pledged to scrap. It was not a comfortable ride for any of the four who appeared in front of the audience in Sheffield who were pressed on issues as broad as the economy, austerity, Brexit, Bolivia, the Russia report, racism, the NHS and plenty more. It was particularly uncomfortable for the Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, who was pummelled by the audience over her promise to stop Brexit by simply halting the process altogether in the unlikely event she won a majority. There were moments of real challenge too for Boris Johnson first on a very simple question - can he be trusted? The audience's attitude made it clear they have a big question about that, and about him. Read more from Laura here.

"This video can not be played Victoria Freeman: ""Going through the right procedures, it didn't work, no-one was listening to me and no-one wanted to help - no one at all."" The mother of a boy who died in a Glasgow hospital two years ago has claimed she was ignored by the health board and the Scottish government. Mason Djemat, three, was being treated at the Royal Hospital for Children and died weeks before Milly Main, 10. Both children were patients on a ward which was affected by water contamination. NHS Greater Glasgow and ClydeandHealth SecretaryJeane Freeman have apologised to their parents. But Mason's mother, Victoria Freeman, told BBC Scotland she is still fighting for answers as to why her son never came home. In her first interview Ms Freeman said: ""There was no-one listening to me. No-one wanted to help. No-one at all."" Victoria Freeman called son Mason 'my good boy' She spoke out after the health secretary's apology, which was made during a statement in the Scottish parliament. But she believes it did not go far enough. She also criticised the health secretary's response to her case since she first wrote to her in September last year. ""I don't think that Mason was acknowledged, particularly by her, and I feel that she did not take Mason's death seriously,"" his mother said. ""If she did maybe we would not be sitting here today speaking about this."" Health Secretary Jeane Freeman made a statement in the Scottish Parliament on Wednesday Police Scotlandinvestigated the boy's deathand have submitted a report to the procurator fiscal. His mother said Mason had Hunter syndrome, a rare genetic condition, but was strong and ""extremely healthy"" when he was admitted to the RHC, part of the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital campus, for treatment in the summer of 2017. At the time she said the family were told there was no concern and he would be getting home within weeks. She added: ""He kept me on my feet that whole time. He was running wild, he was always up and playing and enjoyed his lunch and dinner. ""I remember the nurse came in with his food and he was clapping and laughing, he had such a good character about him."" She said she always called Mason ""my good boy"". The three-year-old could not fully talk but, on the day he died, he surprised his mother by turning to her for the first time and saying: ""Mummy good boy"". She said: ""I actually held him so tight and told him he was the best boy."" Mason pictured in the Royal Hospital for Children, just hours before he died Later that day his mother took a call to say that her son's condition had rapidly and unexpectedly deteriorated. She recalled: ""To be standing in ICU and thinking over in my head 'What's happened?'...I just still don't have the answers and they don't have the answers as well."" Paying tribute to her son, Ms Freeman added: ""Mason was the love of my life. Unfortunately I will never be able to replace him. Never. ""He was just really something. I absolutely adored him."" Health secretary issues apology over child deaths Timeline: The trials of Scotland's super hospital The five-step process to keep NHS boards in line After his death on 9 August 2017 she said she contacted NHSGGC's management department and members of the board but got no response. ""At the time I took myself back to the hospital, I stood in the lobby and I told them I wasn't leaving until someone in charge came and spoke to me,"" she said. A general manager invited her into his office for a meeting that proved pivotal. Ms Freeman added: ""I think that if I didn't do that and I didn't have the strength to do that then they would have closed the book on Mason."" The Queen Elizabeth University Hospital and the Royal Hospital for Children opened in 2015 and share a campus in the south of Glasgow The grieving mother said she first took up her case with the government when she wrote to the health secretary in September last year. She got a response from the management department and then sent two further letters to the health secretary's office. In February she got a ""very scripted"" response which stated it would be ""inappropriate"" for the government to get involved. Asked how she felt she had been treated, Victoria Freeman replied: ""I don't think as a family we have been treated fairly."" She said she kept the matter private and took the ""correct steps"" to raise her concerns about her son's death. But she described the Scottish government's response as ""shocking"" and expressed disappointment that the health secretary had not acknowledged a letter she sent at the weekend, when the story about her son's death broke in the Mail on Sunday. She added: ""It is extremely serious and I think she (health secretary) has to answer not only to my family but to every family involved."" This video can not be played Jeane Freeman told the BBC on Monday 18 December that she had not been made aware of Mason Djemat's case before seeing it in the newspapers Mason's mother also criticised the health secretary for stating in a BBC Radio Scotland interview on Monday that she only learned about the case at the weekend. During First Minister's Questions on Thursday Nicola Sturgeon was asked by acting Scottish Conservative leader Jackson Carlaw about the health secretary's response. Ms Sturgeon told him Health Secretary Jeane Freeman had simply picked up the question wrong. The first minister added: ""I would simply ask him to reflect on why then she would have sought to say that she didn't know about it when there was correspondence in existence that showed that she had."" Mason's mother has requested a meeting with the health secretary and said suggestions the family had been told the cause of death were ""totally incorrect"". She added: ""There is no confirmation of why my son is not here today."" In response to Victoria Freeman's BBC interview, the health secretary said: ""I cannot begin to imagine the pain of losing a child in these circumstances - or the suffering and grief that will stay with them for the rest of their lives. ""My sincerest condolences go to Ms Freeman and the other families affected by this."" The health secretary acknowledged she was first contacted by Ms Freeman in ""late 2018"". The minister added: ""She wrote to me again at the start of this year and I replied, and this was followed by further correspondence just a few days ago. ""I'd like the opportunity to meet with Ms Freeman to listen to her views but also assure her, and the other families affected by this, that we are taking action."" Mason was filmed brushing his teeth during his stay in hospital An NHSGGC spokesman said: ""We are very sorry Ms Freeman feels she has unanswered questions regarding the death of her son, Mason Djemat. ""The case was fully investigated and the outcome shared with the family. ""We met with Ms Freeman on a number of occasions to respond to any concerns she had and can confirm we remain in contact to answer any follow up questions."" An independent review is examining water contamination and other problems at the QEUH campus and will be published in the spring. A separate public inquiry, which will examine safety and wellbeing issues at the QEUH and the new children's hospital in Edinburgh, is also expected to look at water contamination. Milly Main, ten, died at the Royal Hospital for Children on 31 August 2017, three weeks after Mason Milly's death was made public after Labour MSP Anas Sarwar was contacted by a whistleblower. The ten-year-old was recovering from leukaemia treatment when she died on 31 August 2017. Her mother, Kimberly Darroch,told BBC Scotlandshe was ""100%"" convinced her death was linked to water contamination issues. NHSGGC has insisted it was impossible to determine the source of Milly's infection because there was no requirement to test the water supply at the time. Last week it also emerged adoctor-led review,externalhad identified 26 infections at RHC during 2017 which were potentially linked to contaminated water. The Â£842m QEUH ""super hospital"" has faced a number of problems since it opened in 2015. Two cancer wards at the adjoining children's hospitalwere closed last year amid concern about infections and investigation of water supplyissues, and patients were moved to the adult hospital. In January it emerged that two patients at the QEUH had died aftercontracting a fungal infection linked to pigeon droppings. Minister says 'trust me' over hospital concerns.

He was running wild, he was always up and playing and enjoyed his lunch and dinner. ""I remember the nurse came in with his food and he was clapping and laughing, he had such a good character about him."" She said she always called Mason ""my good boy"". The three-year-old could not fully talk but, on the day he died, he surprised his mother by turning to her for the first time and saying: ""Mummy good boy"". She said: ""I actually held him so tight and told him he was the best boy."" Mason pictured in the Royal Hospital for Children, just hours before he died Later that day his mother took a call to say that her son's condition had rapidly and unexpectedly deteriorated. She recalled: ""To be standing in ICU and thinking over in my head 'What's happened?'...I just still don't have the answers and they don't have the answers as well."" Paying tribute to her son, Ms Freeman added: ""Mason was the love of my life. Unfortunately I will never be able to replace him. Never. ""He was just really something. I absolutely adored him."" Health secretary issues apology over child deaths Timeline: The trials of Scotland's super hospital The five-step process to keep NHS boards in line After his death on 9 August 2017 she said she contacted NHSGGC's management department and members of the board but got no response. ""At the time I took myself back to the hospital, I stood in the lobby and I told them I wasn't leaving until someone in charge came and spoke to me,"" she said. A general manager invited her into his office for a meeting that proved pivotal. Ms Freeman added: ""I think that if I didn't do that and I didn't have the strength to do that then they would have closed the book on Mason."" The Queen Elizabeth University Hospital and the Royal Hospital for Children opened in 2015 and share a campus in the south of Glasgow The grieving mother said she first took up her case with the government when she wrote to the health secretary in September last year. She got a response from the management department and then sent two further letters to the health secretary's office. In February she got a ""very scripted"" response which stated it would be ""inappropriate"" for the government to get involved. Asked how she felt she had been treated, Victoria Freeman replied: ""I don't think as a family we have been treated fairly."" She said she kept the matter private and took the ""correct steps"" to raise her concerns about her son's death. But she described the Scottish government's response as ""shocking"" and expressed disappointment that the health secretary had not acknowledged a letter she sent at the weekend, when the story about her son's death broke in the Mail on Sunday. She added: ""It is extremely serious and I think she (health secretary) has to answer not only to my family but to every family involved."" This video can not be played Jeane Freeman told the BBC on Monday 18 December that she had not been made aware of Mason Djemat's case before seeing it in the newspapers Mason's mother also criticised the health secretary for stating in a BBC Radio Scotland interview on Monday that she only learned about the case at the weekend. During First Minister's Questions on Thursday Nicola Sturgeon was asked by acting Scottish Conservative leader Jackson Carlaw about the health secretary's response. Ms Sturgeon told him Health Secretary Jeane Freeman had simply picked up the question wrong. The first minister added: ""I would simply ask him to reflect on why then she would have sought to say that she didn't know about it when there was correspondence in existence that showed that she had."" Mason's mother has requested a meeting with the health secretary and said suggestions the family had been told the cause of death were ""totally incorrect"". She added: ""There is no confirmation of why my son is not here today."" In response to Victoria Freeman's BBC interview, the health secretary said: ""I cannot begin to imagine the pain of losing a child in these circumstances - or the suffering and grief that will stay with them for the rest of their lives. ""My sincerest condolences go to Ms Freeman and the other families affected by this."" The health secretary acknowledged she was first contacted by Ms Freeman in ""late 2018"". The minister added: ""She wrote to me again at the start of this year and I replied, and this was followed by further correspondence just a few days ago. ""I'd like the opportunity to meet with Ms Freeman to listen to her views but also assure her, and the other families affected by this, that we are taking action."" Mason was filmed brushing his teeth during his stay in hospital An NHSGGC spokesman said: ""We are very sorry Ms Freeman feels she has unanswered questions regarding the death of her son, Mason Djemat. ""The case was fully investigated and the outcome shared with the family. ""We met with Ms Freeman on a number of occasions to respond to any concerns she had and can confirm we remain in contact to answer any follow up questions."" An independent review is examining water contamination and other problems at the QEUH campus and will be published in the spring. A separate public inquiry, which will examine safety and wellbeing issues at the QEUH and the new children's hospital in Edinburgh, is also expected to look at water contamination. Milly Main, ten, died at the Royal Hospital for Children on 31 August 2017, three weeks after Mason Milly's death was made public after Labour MSP Anas Sarwar was contacted by a whistleblower. The ten-year-old was recovering from leukaemia treatment when she died on 31 August 2017. Her mother, Kimberly Darroch,told BBC Scotlandshe was ""100%"" convinced her death was linked to water contamination issues. NHSGGC has insisted it was impossible to determine the source of Milly's infection because there was no requirement to test the water supply at the time. Last week it also emerged adoctor-led review,externalhad identified 26 infections at RHC during 2017 which were potentially linked to contaminated water. The Â£842m QEUH ""super hospital"" has faced a number of problems since it opened in 2015. Two cancer wards at the adjoining children's hospitalwere closed last year amid concern about infections and investigation of water supplyissues, and patients were moved to the adult hospital.

"This video can not be played Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage makes election pitch Nigel Farage has unveiled the Brexit Party's general election policies, promising a ""political revolution that puts ordinary people first"". The party leader pledged to halve the foreign aid budget, abolish the House of Lords and cap permanent immigration at 50,000 a year. The Brexit Party is running in 275 seats, after deciding to stand down in the 317 won by the Tories in 2017. It is also promising a ""clean break"" from all EU institutions. LIVE: Latest updates from the election campaign How much does a general election cost? What are the Brexit Party's key policies? Speaking in London, Mr Farage said his party would scrap VAT on fuel bills and stop companies earning less than Â£10,000 a year paying corporation tax. He promised millions of trees would be planted to absorb carbon emissions. Mr Farage said his party would save tens of billions of pounds by redirecting foreign aid, scrapping the HS2 rail project and stopping the UK's contributions to the EU. He also claimed the party could recover Â£7bn from the UK's share of capital at the European Investment Bank. Mr Farage said he favoured making civil servants sign a ""pledge of political neutrality"" and devising ""political guidelines"" for the Supreme Court. He added that any Brexit Party MPs elected would ""hold Boris Johnson to his word"" over Brexit, and act as ""new radicals"" in Parliament to ""change politics for good"". Mr Farage accused the Conservatives of having ""no intention"" of reducing immigration numbers, as firms that supported them wanted ""cheap labour"". ""We would very much want to get immigration numbers down to what for 60 years were very acceptable and very workable post-war levels,"" he said. ""Yes, I'm talking around about 50,000 people a year."" Mr Farage added that work permits would give ""flexibility"" to the system, as there was a difference between permanent settlement and allowing workers to come for a ""time-limited period"". Other pledges include:,external Introducing a ban on exporting waste to other countries for it to be burned Providing free ""base level"" broadband for deprived regions, and free wi-fi on all public transport Abolishing business rates for shops outside the M25, funded by a ""small online sales tax"" Scrapping all interest on student loans, and abolishing inheritance tax Phasing out the BBC licence fee Limiting postal voting to people who are elderly, infirm or overseas Several other political parties have launched traditional manifestos - outlining policy commitments for government - this week, but Mr Farage and his colleagues have declined to do so. The former UKIP leader, who is not standing as a candidate in the election, said manifestos were a ""means of telling people what they want to hear without ever having the genuine desire to implement them"". Instead, he said his party would be making a ""contract with the people,external"" containing a ""targeted set of deliverable pledges"". The Brexit Party has changed its tune on, yes, Brexit. Until a few weeks ago its leader, Nigel Farage was saying a no-deal Brexit was the ""only acceptable deal"". But this ""contract"" moves the goalposts. Gone is the criticism of Boris Johnson's withdrawal agreement - now the party simply promises there will be ""no extended transition period"" after Brexit. Without saying so explicitly in this document, the Brexit Party is warning that it will campaign to ensure Mr Johnson sticks to his promise not to extend the transition any further.

Labour wants to renegotiate the PM's Brexit deal then put it to a referendum within six months, with the option of staying in the EU. The party has not said which side it would take in such a vote.

"Sana Muhammad, formerly known as Devi Unmathallegadoo, was nine months pregnant when she was killed A man who shot dead his heavily pregnant ex-wife with a crossbow has been found guilty of murder. Sana Muhammad was shot through the abdomen by Ramanodge Unmathallegadoo at her home in Ilford, east London, in November 2018. He hid in a shed in his ex-partner's garden armed with two crossbows, bolts, a knife, duct tape, cable ties and a hammer, the Old Bailey heard. Mrs Muhammad's son - her sixth child -was delivered by Caesarean section. Judge Mark Lucraft QC told Unmathallegadoo he had committed ""the most horrendous crime in the face of your own children"". Jurors heard Unmathallegadoo plotted the attack -  buying two crossbows which were discovered near his ex-wife's home by a neighbour in March 2018. After they were removed, he replaced the weapons and organised surveillance on the house in Applegarth Drive. Jurors heard the couple's relationship ended in 2012 and at the time of the attack, Unmathallegadoo was the subject of a court order which banned him from going within 100 metres of his ex's home. Ramanodge Unmathallegadoo murdered his pregnant ex-wife with a crossbow Mrs Muhammad's second husband Imtiaz told the court he was in the garden and thought he was ""dreaming"" when he saw the defendant step out of the shed with two crossbows. He shouted to his wife to run as Unmathallegadoo chased him into their home. ""When she got an arrow she just screamed. I was thinking, 'what is happening?', I was screaming for her."" In a victim impact statement he described her as ""my soul mate, my best friend, my wife, my companion and my everything and I love her dearly. ""Ram has finished everything. We all feel lost now"", he said. Her mother Ellemah (Joytee) Sutharamandoo said the loss of her only child had had a ""profound impact"". ""I lived for my daughter and my grandchildren. ""I now feel alone, there are days I do not want to live."" One of two crossbows used to kill Sana Muhammad Unmathallegadoo had denied murder and claimed he went to the house to talk to Mr Muhammad about his daughter's religion. He told police Mr Muhammad was his target but that his ex-wife got in the way. But the prosecution said Unmathallegadoo had wanted to kill the couple and their unborn child. The court heard Unmathallegadoo's children tried to take the crossbow from him. Susan Krikler, from the CPS, said: ""This was a cold-blooded and calculated execution. ""This devastating attack has left six children without their mother."" He will be sentenced next week. Mrs Muhammad who was born in Mauritius married the defendant when she was 16-years-old Unmathallegadoo first trial in April was discharged after a juror raised an issue about the defendant's mental health despite the judge asking the jury not to speculate on the matter.

"One of the Chagos Islands - Diego Garcia - is home to a US military base The UK has been called an illegal colonial occupier by Mauritius after it ignored a deadline to return control of an overseas territory to the island nation. The UN had given the UK six months to give up control of the Chagos Islands - but that period has now passed. Mauritius says it was forced to trade the small archipelago in the Indian Ocean in 1965 for independence. The UK says it does not recognise Mauritius' claim to sovereignty. Britain's Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) insists it has every right to hold onto the islands - one of which, Diego Garcia, is home to a US military airbase. ""The UK has no doubt as to our sovereignty over the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT), which has been under continuous British sovereignty since 1814,"" it said in a statement. ""Mauritius has never held sovereignty over the BIOT and the UK does not recognise its claim."" But Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn said it was important to return the islands ""as a symbol of the way in which we wish to behave in international law"". He added: ""I am looking forward to being in government to right one of the wrongs of history."" The island community feeling 'lost' in Sussex The Chagos Archipelago was separated from Mauritius in 1965, when Mauritius was still a British colony. Britain purchased it for Â£3m - creating the BIOT. Mauritius claims it was forced to give it up in exchange for independence, which it gained in 1968. In May,the UN General Assembly voted overwhelmingly in favourof the Chagos Islands being returned - with 116 states backing the move and only six against. The UNsaid that the decolonisation of Mauritius,external""was not conducted in a manner consistent with the right to self-determination"" and that therefore the ""continued administration... constitutes a wrongful act"". The UN resolution came only three months afterthe UN's high court advised the UKshould leave the islands ""as rapidly as possible"". As the six-month period came to a close, Mauritian Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth said the UK was now an illegal colonial occupier. Over the decades Mauritius has staked its claim, and finally - particularly after the Brexit vote - Britain's traditional allies in the international community have started to desert Britain, to abstain or to vote against it at the UN. And the UN is now taking pretty significant steps to say: ""Britain you are behaving appallingly, this is still colonialism - give it back."" Britain has ignored those calls - so what might any repercussions look like? Sanctions would be slow, incremental and largely institutional - in the sense that Britain is going to find itself squeezed at institutions that it has traditionally seen as very important. Britain no longer has a judge on 14-seat International Court of Justice in The Hague, and it's going to start to see UN maps reflecting the legal fact that the UN sees this islands as belonging to Mauritius. The deadline is not binding, so no sanctions or immediate punishment will follow - but that could change. At the time of the UN resolution, the FCO said the UK did not recognise Mauritius' claim to sovereignty, but would stand by an earlier commitment to hand over control of the islands to Mauritius when they were no longer needed for defence purposes. Between 1968 and 1974, Britain forcibly removed thousands of Chagossians from their homelands and sent them more than 1,000 miles away to Mauritius and the Seychelles, where they faced extreme poverty and discrimination. Manymoved to the UK in the hope of a better life. Britain then invited the US to build a military base on Diego Garcia. US planes have been sent from the base to bomb Afghanistan and Iraq. The facility was also reportedly used as a ""black site"" by the CIA to interrogate terrorism suspects. In 2016, the lease for the base was extended until 2036. The UK has repeatedly apologised for the forced evictions, which Mr Jugnauth has said were akin to a crime against humanity. In 2002, the British Overseas Territories (BOTs) Act granted British citizenship to resettled Chagossians born between 1969 and 1982. But the 13-year window hasleft some families divided.

"Lingerie brand Victoria's Secret has cancelled its annual fashion show amid dwindling television ratings and rising criticism of the event. The show launched in 1995 and was once a major pop culture event, drawing millions of viewers each year. Last year it had its lowest ratings ever and drew criticism that it was sexist, outdated and lacked diversity. The brand's parent company L Brands said it was important to ""evolve"" its marketing strategy. ""We're figuring out how to advance the positioning of the brand and best communicate that to customers,"" Stuart Burgdoerfer, L Brands chief financial officer, told investors on an earnings call. Nevertheless, he said the shows were ""an important aspect of the brand and a remarkable marketing achievement"". The annual show featured some of the world's top supermodels, often wearing elaborate outfits. The show was a milestone in the career of many supermodels including Tyra Banks, Heidi Klum and Miranda Kerr. Is Victoria's Secret finally embracing all women? What's gone wrong at Victoria's Secret? Changing attitudes appear to have hit sales and the brand's bottom line. Poor sales at Victoria's Secret weighed on the performance of L Brands, which reported a net loss of $252m (Â£195.1m) in third quarter results announced this week. Bella Hadid is one of the many supermodels to have walked in runway shows for Victoria's Secret The underwear brand has also faced a number of recent controversies. Last year, there was a furious response to an interview in Vogue with then-chief marketing officer Ed Razek who suggested ""transsexual"" models should not be part of the event. He later apologised for the comments and left the company earlier this year. L Brands also received bad publicity due to billionaire founder Les Wexner's friendship with thelate US financier Jeffrey Epstein. Epstein died in prison in August while awaiting trial for sex trafficking charges. Mr Wexner employed Epstein as an adviser, but cut ties in 2007, and has previously accused Epstein of misappropriating money. What's gone wrong at Victoria's Secret?

"This video can not be played John McDonnell said the IFS had ""got it wrong this time"" The Institute for Fiscal Studies ""got it wrong"" when it described Labour's tax plans as ""not credible"", the shadow chancellor has said. John McDonnell rejected analysis by the independent research group that said the party's manifesto pledges required broader tax rises than it had outlined. He insisted 95% of people would pay no more tax than they do now. Mr McDonnell also denied the suggestion that raising corporation tax would mean wage cuts and higher prices. Labour's105-page general election page manifesto,externalpromises to ""transform the UK"" with a Â£75bn house building programme and the renationalisation of the railways, mail, water and energy - funded by tax increases on higher earners and reversing corporation tax cuts. The pledges would add Â£83bn to annual government spending by 2024. The IFS said there were ""risks"" with Labour's plans, with its director Paul Johnson adding: ""It will be extremely hard simply to deliver anything like this scale of increase in capital spending, at least in the near-term, certainly in an efficient and cost-effective way."" Kuenssberg: The manifesto Corbyn has always wanted What is in the Labour Party manifesto? Labour eyes 'radical' plan for companies Does Â£80,000 put you in the top 5% of earners? LIVE: Election campaign But Mr McDonnell told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I've a great deal of respect for the IFS... I just think they've got it wrong on this one. ""What we're saying is in terms of income tax, yes the top 5% will pay a bit more - and actually not a great deal more but they'll pay a bit more. The [other] 95% of earners will not pay an increase in the income tax rates or in VAT or in National Insurance."" He said Labour was proposing to ""reverse some of the corporation tax cuts that have been given away by the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats over the last 10 years"", but the rate would remain ""competitive"". The shadow chancellor added: ""With the structural changes we will make in the economy, we'll make sure that actually the corporations themselves do not take that easy option of cutting wages or rising prices, but actually because we're democratising the way these corporations work and are more accountable, they will actually invest in their companies. ""Instead of being driven by short-term profiteering and shareholder interest only, they will think for the long term, invest and grow the economy."" Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Mr McDonnell said the the IFS assessment had also been ""challenged by economists across the piece"". He also confirmed a Labour government would give workers the right to withdraw their labour alongside other striking unions. But questioned on whether this meant the party was planning to overturn legislation barring ""secondary picketing"" - where strikers go to the premises of a firm that trades with their employer, but is not otherwise involved in the dispute - Mr McDonnell said: ""No, no we're not.""

"Four in five 11- to 17-year-olds around the world are not taking enough physical exercise, according to the first such analysis. The World Health Organization says children's health is being damaged as well as their brain development and social skills. It says failing to take the recommended hour a day of exercise is a universal problem in rich and poor countries. Boys were more active than girls in all but four of the 146 countries studied. Pretty much anything that makes the heart beat more quickly and the lungs breathe harder. It could include: running cycling swimming football hopping skipping gymnastics The target is 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous exercise a day. ""I don't regard it as a ridiculous target,"" the WHO's Dr Fiona Bull says. ""It is evidence-based to establish good health and development."" The difference between moderate and vigorous is you can still have a natter while doing moderate exercise but vigorous exercise would leave you too breathless to chat. The main reason is health, both now and in the future. In the short term, being active means: fitter heart and lungs stronger bones and muscles better mental health and wellbeing lower weight ""Active adolescents are likely to be active adults,"" the WHO's Dr Regina Guthold says. And over a lifetime being active can decrease the risk of many diseases, from heart attacks and stroke to type-2 diabetes. Lack of exercise puts one in four adults at risk But the researchers say there is also growing evidence being active is good for the developing brain. ""They have better cognitive function, easier learning, they have better pro-social behaviour,"" Dr Guthold says. Do these findings just tell us something fundamental about children, and indeed all of us, that we'll just crash on the sofa given half a chance? ""Children are not lazy,"" Dr Bull says. ""This tells us something universal but it's not about children. It's the neglect and failure of us to prioritise physical activity - and that seems to be worldwide."" There is no single answer that explains why activity levels are so low but there are some common themes. One is the focus on academic performance over physical fitness. ""Young people in this age group are very encouraged to work hard, to study for exams,"" says Leanne Riley, one of the report's authors. ""Often for very long periods of the day, they're sitting in school doing homework and then they're not getting these opportunities to be more active."" The researchers also say there are issues around ensuring sport and leisure facilities are safe, accessible and affordable. This video can not be played Research suggests that women are less likely to have enjoyed PE at school than men Unsafe roads mean cycling or walking to school or a friend's house is not an option. ""Those safety concerns are a big issue,"" Ms Riley says. The rise of ""digital play"" - a world of entertainment available on a phone, tablet or computer - competing with time spend outside is also a factor. Dr Bull says ""access to entertainment is unprecedented"" and on a completely different scale to previous generations. The World Health Organization report found inactivity was a universal problem, from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe. Bangladesh had the lowest levels of inactivity but it still had 66% of children (two in three) not taking an hour a day of exercise, according to the study. Boys in the Philippines (93%) and girls in South Korea (97%) were the most inactive in the study. In the UK, 75% of boys and 85% of girls were inactive. There are only four countries - Tonga, Samoa, Afghanistan and Zambia - where girls are more active than boys, according to the study. Globally, 85% of girls are taking too little physical exercise, while the figure for boys is 78%, it suggests. Countries such as the United States and Ireland have stark differences between the genders, according to the study. Both have 64% of boys and a relatively whopping 81% of girls being inactive, it suggests. Again, there is not one single reason and they vary from country to country. ""There are also some cultural issues at play here. In some cultures, adolescent girls are not meant to be as active or not encouraged to be as active as the boys,"" Ms Riley says. The researchers also say the way participating in sport is promoted often means it appeals more to boys than to girls. And more effort is needed to push the activities girls find more appealing. Mrs Riley also says there are simply not the facilities. ""Very often, there aren't that separated changing rooms, so that girls can can feel comfortable participating in in sports,"" she says. Slightly better. The study,published in The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health,external, looked at activity levels recorded between 2001 and 2016. In that time, inactivity in boys fell from 80% to 78%, while in girls it stayed at 85%, according to the study. Dr Mark Tremblay, from the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Research Institute, in Canada, says: ""The electronic revolution has fundamentally transformed people's movement patterns by changing where and how they live, learn, work, play, and travel, progressively isolating them indoors, most often in chairs. ""People sleep less, sit more, walk less frequently, drive more regularly, and do less physical activity than they used to."" Prof Russell Viner, the President of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, says the findings are ""concerning"". ""Children who are more active have better health and wellbeing and generally do better in school,"" he says. ""We should be making it easier for children and young people to have active and healthy lives - this is easier said than done."" Follow Jameson Twitter,external.

"One of the Chagos Islands - Diego Garcia - is home to a US military base The UK has been called an illegal colonial occupier by Mauritius after it ignored a deadline to return control of an overseas territory to the island nation. The UN had given the UK six months to give up control of the Chagos Islands - but that period has now passed. Mauritius says it was forced to trade the small archipelago in the Indian Ocean in 1965 for independence. The UK says it does not recognise Mauritius' claim to sovereignty. Britain's Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) insists it has every right to hold onto the islands - one of which, Diego Garcia, is home to a US military airbase. ""The UK has no doubt as to our sovereignty over the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT), which has been under continuous British sovereignty since 1814,"" it said in a statement. ""Mauritius has never held sovereignty over the BIOT and the UK does not recognise its claim."" But Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn said it was important to return the islands ""as a symbol of the way in which we wish to behave in international law"". He added: ""I am looking forward to being in government to right one of the wrongs of history."" The island community feeling 'lost' in Sussex The Chagos Archipelago was separated from Mauritius in 1965, when Mauritius was still a British colony. Britain purchased it for Â£3m - creating the BIOT. Mauritius claims it was forced to give it up in exchange for independence, which it gained in 1968. In May,the UN General Assembly voted overwhelmingly in favourof the Chagos Islands being returned - with 116 states backing the move and only six against. The UNsaid that the decolonisation of Mauritius,external""was not conducted in a manner consistent with the right to self-determination"" and that therefore the ""continued administration... constitutes a wrongful act"". The UN resolution came only three months afterthe UN's high court advised the UKshould leave the islands ""as rapidly as possible"". As the six-month period came to a close, Mauritian Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth said the UK was now an illegal colonial occupier. Over the decades Mauritius has staked its claim, and finally - particularly after the Brexit vote - Britain's traditional allies in the international community have started to desert Britain, to abstain or to vote against it at the UN. And the UN is now taking pretty significant steps to say: ""Britain you are behaving appallingly, this is still colonialism - give it back."" Britain has ignored those calls - so what might any repercussions look like? Sanctions would be slow, incremental and largely institutional - in the sense that Britain is going to find itself squeezed at institutions that it has traditionally seen as very important. Britain no longer has a judge on 14-seat International Court of Justice in The Hague, and it's going to start to see UN maps reflecting the legal fact that the UN sees this islands as belonging to Mauritius. The deadline is not binding, so no sanctions or immediate punishment will follow - but that could change. At the time of the UN resolution, the FCO said the UK did not recognise Mauritius' claim to sovereignty, but would stand by an earlier commitment to hand over control of the islands to Mauritius when they were no longer needed for defence purposes. Between 1968 and 1974, Britain forcibly removed thousands of Chagossians from their homelands and sent them more than 1,000 miles away to Mauritius and the Seychelles, where they faced extreme poverty and discrimination. Manymoved to the UK in the hope of a better life. Britain then invited the US to build a military base on Diego Garcia. US planes have been sent from the base to bomb Afghanistan and Iraq. The facility was also reportedly used as a ""black site"" by the CIA to interrogate terrorism suspects. In 2016, the lease for the base was extended until 2036. The UK has repeatedly apologised for the forced evictions, which Mr Jugnauth has said were akin to a crime against humanity. In 2002, the British Overseas Territories (BOTs) Act granted British citizenship to resettled Chagossians born between 1969 and 1982. But the 13-year window hasleft some families divided.

"TSB says it has resolved an IT failure which meant wages and other payments were not paid into some of its customers' accounts. The bank says it was due to a ""processing error"" and those affected will not be left out of pocket. But customers complained about being unable to pay their rent and long call wait times when trying to seek help. It comes just days afterTSB was criticised over IT failuresthat hit 1.9 million customers in April 2018. An independent report into last year's incident said the bank's board lacked ""common sense"" as it prepared to switch customers on to a new IT system, which the investigation said had not been tested properly before going live. It is unclear how many customers were affected by the latest problem and exactly how long the system was down. TSB said: ""We apologise for any inconvenience this has caused."" MPs demand action over rise in online bank crashes A number of customers contacted the BBC suggesting the issue went beyond processing of payments, with internet banking and the app down as well. Bob Skinley said: ""I've been trying all morning to get into my internet banking account and can't so looks like they're having a bit of a meltdown yet again. ""Sounding horribly like the last fiasco."" Lorna tweeted that her pay had eventually come through. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Yanique Sharifa told the BBC: ""I started to notice an issue from yesterday morning. I made a wire transaction that was not showing as it usually does right away. Then I get paid every Friday without fail, I've called and checked if payment was issued.  That was confirmed but still I see no money in my bank. ""I been on the phone trying to get through to TSB for over an hour and no answer."" The timing of this latest IT error was bad for customers - some of whom were expecting wages or preparing their finances for the weekend - but it was even worse for TSB. Earlier this week, nobody at the bank came out with any credit from the independent report by law firm Slaughter and May into last year's meltdown.

"TSB says it has resolved an IT failure which meant wages and other payments were not paid into some of its customers' accounts. The bank says it was due to a ""processing error"" and those affected will not be left out of pocket. But customers complained about being unable to pay their rent and long call wait times when trying to seek help. It comes just days afterTSB was criticised over IT failuresthat hit 1.9 million customers in April 2018. An independent report into last year's incident said the bank's board lacked ""common sense"" as it prepared to switch customers on to a new IT system, which the investigation said had not been tested properly before going live. It is unclear how many customers were affected by the latest problem and exactly how long the system was down. TSB said: ""We apologise for any inconvenience this has caused."" MPs demand action over rise in online bank crashes A number of customers contacted the BBC suggesting the issue went beyond processing of payments, with internet banking and the app down as well. Bob Skinley said: ""I've been trying all morning to get into my internet banking account and can't so looks like they're having a bit of a meltdown yet again. ""Sounding horribly like the last fiasco."" Lorna tweeted that her pay had eventually come through. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""I been on the phone trying to get through to TSB for over an hour and no answer."" The timing of this latest IT error was bad for customers - some of whom were expecting wages or preparing their finances for the weekend - but it was even worse for TSB.

"Lingerie brand Victoria's Secret has cancelled its annual fashion show amid dwindling television ratings and rising criticism of the event. The show launched in 1995 and was once a major pop culture event, drawing millions of viewers each year. Last year it had its lowest ratings ever and drew criticism that it was sexist, outdated and lacked diversity. The brand's parent company L Brands said it was important to ""evolve"" its marketing strategy. ""We're figuring out how to advance the positioning of the brand and best communicate that to customers,"" Stuart Burgdoerfer, L Brands chief financial officer, told investors on an earnings call. Nevertheless, he said the shows were ""an important aspect of the brand and a remarkable marketing achievement"". The annual show featured some of the world's top supermodels, often wearing elaborate outfits. The show was a milestone in the career of many supermodels including Tyra Banks, Heidi Klum and Miranda Kerr. Is Victoria's Secret finally embracing all women? What's gone wrong at Victoria's Secret? Changing attitudes appear to have hit sales and the brand's bottom line. Poor sales at Victoria's Secret weighed on the performance of L Brands, which reported a net loss of $252m (Â£195.1m) in third quarter results announced this week. Bella Hadid is one of the many supermodels to have walked in runway shows for Victoria's Secret The underwear brand has also faced a number of recent controversies. Last year, there was a furious response to an interview in Vogue with then-chief marketing officer Ed Razek who suggested ""transsexual"" models should not be part of the event. He later apologised for the comments and left the company earlier this year. L Brands also received bad publicity due to billionaire founder Les Wexner's friendship with thelate US financier Jeffrey Epstein. Epstein died in prison in August while awaiting trial for sex trafficking charges. Mr Wexner employed Epstein as an adviser, but cut ties in 2007, and has previously accused Epstein of misappropriating money. What's gone wrong at Victoria's Secret?

"This video can not be played Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage makes election pitch Nigel Farage has unveiled the Brexit Party's general election policies, promising a ""political revolution that puts ordinary people first"". The party leader pledged to halve the foreign aid budget, abolish the House of Lords and cap permanent immigration at 50,000 a year. The Brexit Party is running in 275 seats, after deciding to stand down in the 317 won by the Tories in 2017. It is also promising a ""clean break"" from all EU institutions. LIVE: Latest updates from the election campaign How much does a general election cost? What are the Brexit Party's key policies? Speaking in London, Mr Farage said his party would scrap VAT on fuel bills and stop companies earning less than Â£10,000 a year paying corporation tax. He promised millions of trees would be planted to absorb carbon emissions. Mr Farage said his party would save tens of billions of pounds by redirecting foreign aid, scrapping the HS2 rail project and stopping the UK's contributions to the EU. He also claimed the party could recover Â£7bn from the UK's share of capital at the European Investment Bank. Mr Farage said he favoured making civil servants sign a ""pledge of political neutrality"" and devising ""political guidelines"" for the Supreme Court. He added that any Brexit Party MPs elected would ""hold Boris Johnson to his word"" over Brexit, and act as ""new radicals"" in Parliament to ""change politics for good"". Mr Farage accused the Conservatives of having ""no intention"" of reducing immigration numbers, as firms that supported them wanted ""cheap labour"". ""We would very much want to get immigration numbers down to what for 60 years were very acceptable and very workable post-war levels,"" he said. ""Yes, I'm talking around about 50,000 people a year."" Mr Farage added that work permits would give ""flexibility"" to the system, as there was a difference between permanent settlement and allowing workers to come for a ""time-limited period"". Other pledges include:,external Introducing a ban on exporting waste to other countries for it to be burned Providing free ""base level"" broadband for deprived regions, and free wi-fi on all public transport Abolishing business rates for shops outside the M25, funded by a ""small online sales tax"" Scrapping all interest on student loans, and abolishing inheritance tax Phasing out the BBC licence fee Limiting postal voting to people who are elderly, infirm or overseas Several other political parties have launched traditional manifestos - outlining policy commitments for government - this week, but Mr Farage and his colleagues have declined to do so. The former UKIP leader, who is not standing as a candidate in the election, said manifestos were a ""means of telling people what they want to hear without ever having the genuine desire to implement them"". Instead, he said his party would be making a ""contract with the people,external"" containing a ""targeted set of deliverable pledges"". The Brexit Party has changed its tune on, yes, Brexit. Until a few weeks ago its leader, Nigel Farage was saying a no-deal Brexit was the ""only acceptable deal"". But this ""contract"" moves the goalposts. Gone is the criticism of Boris Johnson's withdrawal agreement - now the party simply promises there will be ""no extended transition period"" after Brexit. Without saying so explicitly in this document, the Brexit Party is warning that it will campaign to ensure Mr Johnson sticks to his promise not to extend the transition any further. Read more here Brexit:The Conservatives say they will deliver Brexit by the end of January 2020 under the terms of the PM's deal negotiated with the EU. The Liberal Democrats have vowed to cancel Brexit if elected as a majority government, or otherwise campaign for a referendum including the option of staying in the EU. Labour wants to renegotiate the PM's Brexit deal then put it to a referendum within six months, with the option of staying in the EU. The party has not said which side it would take in such a vote. The SNP wants Scotland to stay in the EU. Immigration:Labour has not set a target in its manifesto, but has pledged to regulate the labour market to stop the ""undercutting of wages and conditions"". For the Tories, Home Secretary Priti Patel has previously said overall immigration should come down, but not according to an ""arbitrary"" target. Boris Johnson has promised to reduce unskilled migration. The SNP says cutting immigration would damage the Scottish economy. Trees:The Conservatives have said they will plant 30 million trees a year by 2025 if they win the election. The Liberal Democrats have pledged to plant twice as many trees in the same period. Labour has promised an ""ambitious programme of tree planting"", including a forest of a million trees to help the NHS become carbon neutral.

"Plaid Cymruhas launched its 2019 manifesto,,externalcalled Wales, It's Us. It sets out the policies it wants to see introduced by the next UK government. The document calls for Wales to stay in the European Union and puts forwards its key aims for Wales under the banner ""Westminster does not work for Wales"". But what are the promises being made in a bid to win over voters on polling day, 12 December? A people's vote on Brexit and campaigning to remain in the EU. In September 2019, Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price called on his party to campaign to cancel Brexit in a general election without the need for a second referendum. Weeks later, the party's position shifted. Party members voted to support a second EU referendum, unless faced with the prospect of a no-deal Brexit, in which case Plaid would revert to unilateral revocation of the Article 50 Brexit process. In a bid to return as many pro-Remain MPs to Westminster, Plaid Cymru hasstruck an electoral pact with the Liberal Democrats and the Greens, but is not standing aside for Labour candidates, despite Jeremy Corbyn's promise of a second EU referendum. That decision could make a difference in key Labour-Conservative marginal seats and, if that in turn helps Boris Johnson secure a majority in the House of Commons, then it's curtains for a second EU referendum. Where do the main parties stand on Brexit? This video can not be played Plaid promises to ""make our own Wales"" Create tens of thousands highly skilled ""green collar jobs"" to fight climate change. Plaid Cymru is promising a Â£15bn Welsh Green Jobs Revolution paid for by the UK government increasing capital investment for 10 years and Wales getting its share of that. It would also ask the Treasury to allow the Welsh Government to borrow Â£5bn and use both funding sources pay for ""tens of thousands"" of new green jobs. Plaid Cymru promises publicly-owned full fibre broadband by 2025 - five years earlier than Labour - and said it would build 20,000 green social homes and spend Â£5bn making homes more energy efficient and reduce fuel poverty. Will this be a Brexit election? Hybrid electric and diesel trains that run from London to Wales South Wales Valleys electrification would be completed, followed by the north Wales coast line. Many in the rail industry think it was a mistake to emphasise shorter journey times as the main benefit of electrification, which is expensive. It left some wondering whether spending billions to save minutes on journeys was value for money. But electrification allows bigger trains to be run on lines. They can be more frequent and more reliable. The trains themselves are more environmentally friendly and more travellers might be encouraged to use public transport rather than cars. Businesses have long pushed for rail electrification in areas where demand justifies the cost. As with all major infrastructure projects, electrification requires a skilled workforce which will mean overcoming the current skill shortages. Extra investment in early intervention and preventative health care. Unlike the healthcare on the NHS, social care is not usually free. At the moment some people aged 65 and over will get help towards their costs, but others can pay in full. And social care is delivered by a mixture of bodies - councils, private bodies and third sector organisations. This policy was one recommended by a commission set up by Plaid Cymru to think about radical solutions to a growing problem - an ageing population. It estimated the cost of the policy would be an extra Â£247m a year, which it described as ""eminently affordable. But the truth is nobody really knows at what the final price tag would be. In a report commissioned by the Welsh Government last year, economist Gerry Holtham suggested anincome tax of between 1% and 3% could be used to fund elderly social carein Wales. What's clear is having adequate social care is important for the future of the NHS, as when care is lacking people end up in hospital - increasing the strain on a health service that's already struggling. How does social care compare to the rest of the UK? Why more people are talking about social care Establish a national commission to examine changing legislation on drug dependency. Plaid Cymru says the current hard-line approach to drugs isn't working. They say it criminalises those with an addiction, a medical need, or recreational users who ""do no harm to others"". The party is not saying it would definitely decriminalise drugs, as has happened in Portugal. Instead, it proposes a commission to reform drug laws. It also wants a public health focus to dissuade people from taking drugs, to get addicts treated and find solutions to the problems that led them to drugs in the first place. The party says that would leave police free to tackle those who profit from the drugs trade.

To fund a Â£25 a week tax credit for those paying more than 30% of their income on rent and utility bills. In the past decade, Welsh Labour governments signed up to ambitious targets to eliminate child poverty - but the ambition proved too difficult. In May this year, research by charities found Wales was the only UK nation to see an increase in child poverty last year. Now Plaid says it will introduce new legally-binding targets. As a step towards meeting them, it would pay Â£35 a week to every child in a low-income family. There would also be a tax credit of up to Â£25 a week for tenants in the private sector who spend more than 30% of their income on rent. Child poverty rise in Wales Reality Check: Plaid on poverty The money would be made available for Welsh schools and colleges. Plaid Cymru says schools are facing a ""funding emergency"" and many people working in classrooms would agree. Education is devolved, so Plaid is setting out its stall on education here rather than putting forward a plan that could be implemented at Westminster. An extra Â£300m a year for schools and colleges seems a healthy increase. But how healthy depends on the benchmark. Day-to-day spending on schools this year is Â£2.6bn. An extra Â£300m a year would make a dent in real terms spending cuts of 6% over the past decade. But Plaid's pledge includes money for colleges too, which come from a different pot, as does capital spending. The party says some of that Â£300m a year would go towards school buildings, including new Welsh medium schools. Brain Drain Wales? Teaching Welsh history - why it is important Wylfa shut at the end of 2015 - plans for its replacement have stalled To oppose the development of new sites for nuclear power plants. This has always been a tricky area for Plaid Cymru. Though they oppose nuclear power on principle, some in the party haven't wanted to turn away the jobs and investment promised by the proposed replacement of the Wylfa plant on Anglesey - the island seat is one of their top targets. Notice that this policy still gives them the wriggle room to potentially support the redevelopment of existing sites. Having said that, in the race for leadership of the party, Adam Price said a new nuclear plant would be an ""enormous burden"" that would be incompatible with Welsh independence. What's Wylfa and why is it important? The target represents two additional officers per community. The challenge for any police force is the loud cry from Joe Public that they want to see more bobbies on the beat. It's a security thing. People feel safer if there's a visible deterrent. So Plaid Cymru's offer of 1,600 more officers in Wales - two per community - will be popular. Though it is probably on a par with the numbers theConservatives have already pledged for Walesover the next three years. It's worth remembering more crime is detected, prevented and solved from an office. But with the cuts forces have faced over the past 10 years, any increase, regardless of where, would be welcomed. Reality check: Police numbers in Wales and England This video can not be played What does devolution mean for voters? Powers on corporation tax, air passenger duty and VAT for Wales. The Welsh Government has powers over some taxation, but Plaid Cymru wants more to ensure taxation raises the money Wales needs. It wants VAT revenues generated in Wales to remain there and for air passenger duty to be devolved, as happens in Scotland. It also wants Wales to have powers over corporation tax and, like the Conservatives, Plaid Cymruwants to put on hold the planned cut in corporation taxfrom 19% to 17% for 2020-21.  The party also argues the employee rate of National Insurance should rise from 2% to 4% for high earners. Decisions to go to war should require support of all four UK nations. Issues of defence and war are the responsibility of politicians in Westminster - there is no role at all for the Welsh assembly, Northern Irish assembly or Scottish parliament. Technically speaking, there isn't even a legal requirement for the prime minister to secure the support of MPs before launching military action. However, since Tony Blair's Labour government asked MPs in March 2003 to approve the Iraq invasion, a convention has developed - although not always followed - to consult the UK Parliament. But calls to formalise the UK Parliament's role haven't gone further than the drawing board, let alone include discussion of a role for the devolved assemblies and parliament.

"This video can not be played ""Rail, mail, water and energy into public ownership"": Jeremy Corbyn launches Labour's manifesto Labour has launched its general election manifesto, promising to ""transform"" the UK and to renationalise rail, mail, water and energy. Leader Jeremy Corbyn also vowed ""a green transformation"" of the economy, aiming to get the UK ""on track"" for a net-zero carbon system by the 2030s. The 105 page manifesto,externalincludes a windfall tax on oil firms and scrapping rises in the state pension age. Mr Corbyn said his offer to voters was ""radical"" and would mean ""real change"". He accused ""bankers, billionaires and the establishment"" of wanting to thwart his plans, adding: ""They don't own the Labour Party. The people own the Labour Party."" Kuenssberg: The manifesto Corbyn has always wanted What is in the Labour Party manifesto? Labour eyes 'radical' plan for companies On Brexit, Labour says it wants to renegotiate a new Brexit deal, incorporating a close relationship with the EU, which would then be put to a ""legally binding"" referendum. On Scottish independence, the party says it would not grant permission for a referendum on the issue ""in the early years"" of a Labour government. BBC economics correspondent Dharshini David said Labour's manifesto pledges would add Â£83bn to annual government spending by 2024. The party said this would be paid for by tax increases on higher earners and reversing corporation tax cuts. Â£75bn to build 150,000 new council and social homes a year, within five years An immediate 5% pay rise for public sector workers, with year-on-year above-inflation pay rises to follow Introducing a ""real living wage"" of at least Â£10 an hour Reviewing the retirement age for people in hard manual jobs Introducing a second homes tax Reversing inheritance tax cuts and imposing VAT on private school fees Giving EU nationals living in UK the automatic right to stay Reinstating 3,000 bus routes that have been cut Free broadband for all, delivered by part-nationalising BT A Â£3bn plan to offer adults in England free access to retraining A pledge to reduce all primary school classes to fewer than 30 children Free personal at-home care in England for over-65s most in need of it A pledge to renew the Trident nuclear deterrent and spend at least 2% of GDP on defence Reducing the voting age to 16 This video can not be played BBC political correspondent, Iain Watson, explores what's in Labour's manifesto Speaking at Birmingham City University, Mr Corbyn insisted Labour's policies were fully costed and ""popular"". But there has been internal controversy over the idea of a one-off tax on oil companies, with some trade union officials fearing it would damage Scotland's North Sea Oil industry. Labour and Tories push rival housing policies Labour's big-state, big-spend, transformation plan Mr Corbyn is promising to set up a Â£250bn Green Transformation Fund - to be paid for through borrowing - to fund 300,000 new ""green apprenticeships"" and loans for people to buy electric cars. And Labour is promising to ""achieve the substantial majority of our emissions reductions by 2030 in a way that is evidence-based"". This is without doubt the most ambitious - and most costly - manifesto I've ever seen. Radical it absolutely is, but the question is: is it credible or affordable? Labour says yes, by introducing higher taxes on the wealthy and big businesses. But we live in a globalised era when the wealthy can move their money around. Would they leave their cash in a Labour Britain that was going to tax them more? Another credibility question that centres on Jeremy Corbyn is whether is he the leader to deliver this, given he won't answer the most basic, fundamental political question of our time, which is: ""Are you for or against Brexit?"" Mr Corbyn said it was a ""manifesto of hope"", adding: ""Over the next three weeks, the most powerful people in Britain and their supporters are going to tell you that everything in this manifesto is impossible. ""That it's too much for you. Because they don't want real change. Why would they? The system is working just fine for them. It's rigged in their favour."" The party is hoping its manifesto will help it get back into power for the first time since 2010, but the opinion polls so far suggest it is heading for defeat on 12 December. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn defends ""radical"" Labour manifesto Labour is locked in a battle with the Conservatives - who are also promising to borrow money to spend on public services - in seats across the Midlands and the north of England. In his speech, Mr Corbyn said voters could trust his party to deliver its pledges because ""we're opposed by the vested interests for standing up for a different kind of society"". ""We'll deliver real change for the many, and not the few,"" he said. Responding to the manifesto launch, the Conservatives said: ""A Corbyn-led government would mean higher taxes, the chaos of two more referendums, and frightening levels of debt."" A spokesman added that ""hardworking taxpayers"" would be left to ""foot the bill"". Lib Dem Brexit spokesman Tom Brake said Mr Corbyn's wider plans would be ""badly damaged"" if Labour took the UK out of the EU. He added that ""the extensive plan of nationalisation"" would ""keep government locked down for years"".

The Liberal Democrats have vowed to cancel Brexit if elected as a majority government, or otherwise campaign for a referendum including the option of staying in the EU. The SNP wants Scotland to stay in the EU. The Brexit Party wants the UK to leave immediately without an exit deal, but negotiate a free trade agreement with the EU. Carbon neutrality:The Conservatives have said they want to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, while the Liberal Democrats have pledged to achieve this by 2045. The Green party has gone even further, by aiming for carbon neutrality by 2030. The SNP says it wants a 100% reduction in emissions as soon as possible. Housing:The Liberal Democrats say total house building should rise to 300,000 homes each year, a third of which should be for social rent. The party wants to allow social renters to use their rent payments to build up a stake in their property, and give government-backed loans to first-time renters to help with tenancy deposits. The Conservatives have announced measures which they say will boost private house building, promising a million homes over the next five years. They have also pledged to ""work with investors and others"" to increase the availability of long-term fixed rate mortgages up to 95% of a house's value.

"This video can not be played Plaid promises to ""make our own Wales"" Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price has called for a Â£20bn ""green jobs revolution"" in Wales as he launched the party's general election manifesto. The 10-year plan includes rail and bus travel schemes, three tidal lagoons, a barrage and a new offshore wind farm. Mr Price said tens of thousands of ""green collar"" jobs can be created and the ""urgent climate emergency"" tackled. He said his party would also fight to remain in the EU in a ""final referendum"" on the UK's membership. ""We must defeat the negative, hope-crushing wrecking ball that is Brexit,"" he said. ""And if you want the people to have their final say then we must encourage as many of them to say loudly and clearly in the days ahead this Brexit is not for us, it never was and never will be."" Live: On the campaign trail Who is Adam Price? Key Plaid Cymru policies explained A simple guide to Plaid Cymru Election policy guide Mr Price said the party's green proposals would make Wales self-sustainable in renewable energy by 2030. Plaid Cymru later clarified that this meant electricity. ""Wales was the cradle of the first industrial revolution, but the sad truth known to all of us who live in Wales is that our country hasn't reaped the benefits of our own wealth,"" he told activists at the launch event at a college in Nantgarw, near Cardiff. ""We know that Wales has enormous potential - we are rich in natural resources and our people are talented and skilled. ""Just as we were the first time, we can be the cradle of another revolution - a green jobs revolution - creating tens of thousands of green collar jobs and seriously tackling the urgent climate emergency we face."" A new offshore wind farm is among the renewable energy projects proposed The green plan include: Electrification of all mainline rail lines, the south Wales Valley Lines and North Wales Coast railway A south east Wales ""super metro"" transport system, metro for Swansea Bay and the western valleys and for north east Wales Re-opening rail services in the Amman, Tawe, Neath, and Dulais valleys Building tidal lagoons in Swansea Bay, Cardiff and Colwyn Bay, an offshore wind farm off Anglesey and a barrage on the River Usk Building 20,000 green social houses and a Â£5bn home energy efficiency programme To pay for the plan, Plaid Cymru is calling for the UK government to devote an extra 1% ofGDP, a measure of the size of the economy, to green investment over 10 years, which the party says would give Wales a share worth Â£15bn. The party also says the Treasury should raise Wales' borrowing limit from Â£1bn to Â£5bn, to reach the Â£20bn total for green schemes. Since becoming Plaid Cymru leader a year ago, Mr Price has made achieving the goal of Welsh independence central to his message, predicting a referendum on the issue by 2030. During his speech, he said his party would bring about ""a Wales and a world that's cleaner and safer and fairer and better"". ""They say that our dream of an independent Wales is improbable, that our poverty is inevitable, well, this is the moment when the improbable beats what Westminster says is inevitable,"" he said. ""This is the moment when we start to believe that our future won't be written for us in the corridors of Westminster, or the streets of Whitehall but by us in the valleys and villages of a nation remade."" Another Brexit referendum to give the public a final say - the party backs remaining in the EU Give Wales control of migration policy so it can plug staff shortages in key sectors Free social care at the point of needas part of a new National Health and Social Care service, plus an extra 1,000 doctors, 5,000 nurses and 100 NHS dentists Universal free childcare for 40 hours a week anda Â£35 a week payment for every child in low income households Set up a Welsh justice system with powers over policing and therecruitment of 1,600 more police officers Drug law reform to be examined by a national commission, with a view that the current hard-line approach isn't working Devolution of corporation tax, air passenger duty and VAT Decisions to go to war should require the support of all four nations of the UK The tricky challenge for Plaid Cymru in this general election is how to position themselves against Labour as a party of the left that's got a more attractive offering to voters. With UK Labour publishing the most radical manifesto in a generation  - put to one side questions about its deliverability for a moment - there's no way Plaid could credibly outbid it in terms of spending promises. Especially since they can't form a government on December 13th - in fact many of the promises in their manifesto rely on them winning the Welsh Assembly election in 2021. So the tactic is to juxtapose UK Labour with Welsh Labour who've been in government in the assembly for 20 years - in other words, while Jeremy Corbyn can argue he's the agent of change in Westminster, Adam Price argues he's the one who's offering change in Wales, where Labour has dominated the political landscape for a century. What makes this election even more tricky is that while Plaid are trying to gain extra seats like Ynys Mon, two of the four seats they're defending have tiny majorities. The stakes are high for Plaid's leader, but the margins are very fine indeed. A number of other parties have already launched their manifestos: Labour promised ""real change"" with their ""radical"" plans, includingnationalisation projects, green jobs and more council homes The Lib Dems have promised a ""brighter future"" by stopping Brexit,as well as extra funding for the NHS and free childcare The Green Party has proposed to spend Â£100bn a year to cut emissions, along witha basic income for all and banning single use plastic Here's a concise guide to where the parties stand on key issues like Brexit, education and the NHS.

"University of Lincoln graduate Grace Millane had been travelling alone in New Zealand The man accused of murdering British backpacker Grace Millane ""eroticised her death"", prosecutors have said. Ms Millane, 21, died in a hotel room in Auckland, New Zealand, before being buried in woodland outside the city. In a closing speech, prosecutor Brian Dickey said the defendant had ""sexualised"" the killing by taking intimate photos of her dead body before viewing pornography online. His defence claims the death was an accident during consensual sex. Ms Millane, from Wickford, Essex, died on the night before her 22nd birthday in December last year. CCTV pictures showed Ms Millane and the defendant ordering cocktails during a date The defence has told Auckland High Court her death was not murder, but the result of choking during sex which ""went wrong"". In his closing remarks, Mr Dickey said evidence from pathologists had shown fatal strangulation results from ""sustained pressure"" to the neck. Ms Millane would have ""gone limp"" and shown other signs of physical distress some time before death, he said. ""If you are satisfied that [the defendant] knew he was doing something that would cause some harm, he did it and then death occurred, he would be guilty of murder,"" he told jurors. In his closing speech, Ian Brookie, for the defendant, said the ""core"" of his client's story of an accident matched with the evidence. ""These two people did get carried away in the moment, they did get affected by alcohol and were not experienced in these types of activities, particularly pressure to the neck,"" he said The defendant's behaviour had shown a ""real lack of planning and a lack of sophistication"", he added. Ms Millane and the man were seen entering his apartment building on their way to his room But Mr Dickey said the man's actions after Ms Millane's death had been ""cool, calm and calculated"" and not panicked as claimed by the defence. The 27-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, admits putting Ms Millane's body in a suitcase which was found in the mountainous WaitÄkere Ranges outside Auckland. Mr Dickey said the man had searched for information about the area before taking photos of Ms Millane's corpse. He had bought a second suitcase in a bid to cover his tracks, as well as cleaning products and a shovel, jurors heard. The man further showed a lack of concern for Ms Millane's dignity when he went on a Tinder date the next day while her body was still inside his hotel room, Mr Dickey said. The trial continues.

"Barbara Taylor Bradford said period TV dramas since A Woman of Substance were ""junk"" Barbara Taylor Bradford's blockbuster A Woman of Substance sold millions of copies and became a mini-series that is still Channel 4's most-watched show. Now, the author is writing a new novel that revisits the story - but from a different point of view. The 1979 original followed Emma Harte from Yorkshire maid to business giant. The new book will return to the young Emma's era, but telling the story of her friend Blackie O'Neill - played by a young Liam Neeson in the TV version. Jenny Seagrove as young Emma and Liam Neeson as Blackie in the 1985 TV version ""I'm in the in the process of creating a life for Blackie which we never saw in A Woman of Substance,"" she told BBC News. The 86-year-old author was inspired to write Blackie and Emma while at her husband Robert's bedside in hospital. She had been due to write a third instalment in her House of Falconer saga instead, but was unable to do the required research. Robert, a film producer, died in July. ""I was sitting there, my mind wandering and knowing what was going to happen, and trying to think, what can I write that will beâ¦ no book is easy, but what would be easier than having to do a load of research? And I suddenly thought of Blackie. ""My editor said that was Bob's gift to me. He made me think of Blackie as a book."" Part of the new novel acts as a prequel to A Woman of Substance, following Blackie from 13-year-old orphan in Ireland until he meets Emma Harte on a Yorkshire moor. The story then runs in parallel to the original, following Blackie's fortunes rather than Emma's. Deborah Kerr as an older Emma at the head of the table ""Where does he go? What does he do? Is he really a good man? Has he any troubles? Has he had other women? It's really Blackie's book,"" the Yorkshire-born writer said. A Woman of Substance has sold 30 million copies, according to Bradford's official biography, and spawned six sequels. The original mini-series was watched by almost 14 million people on Channel 4 in 1985 and was nominated for two Emmys. ""I think it was ahead of its time in every way,"" the author said. ""There's been no TV series made since that's had any plot or drama. It's all junk when it comes to those sorts of 'big house' stories. ""A Woman of Substance was very much a big hit with Channel 4. It took all the ratings and it's a story that's got everything in it. It's got love, it's got drama, it's got death, it's got success, it's got tragedy."" Taylor Bradford said she doesn't watch much TV, and when she does she prefers factual programmes. ""I have watched some of Downton,"" she said. ""It's very pretty. But I'm more for a documentary or news."" The second book in her House of Falconer series, In the Lion's Den, is published on 28 November.

"Jeremy Corbyn always promised something different. He was chosen by his party in 2015 largely because he was such a contrast to the other candidates who seemed, fairly or unfairly,  somehow to merge into one. If his 2017 general election manifesto was exciting for those on the left of the Labour Party,today's publication,externalmight feel like their dreams have come true. Indeed, as the Labour leader went through his programme for the country at the party's manifesto launch today there was a sense that finally, after more than four years of being in charge, when he has often been tangled up in the party's own internal wars, he's been able to say what he really wants to do, and how he would really seek to achieve it. This isn't a souped-up version of Ed Miliband in 2015, it's not really a more full throttle version of 2017. Labour vows to 'transform' UK at manifesto launch What are the 12 key policies in the Labour manifesto? This is Labour's 2017 election manifesto with rocket boosters - several huge nationalisations, higher taxes for the wealthy and business, a rewiring of the rules on the economy, a huge expansion in the role of the state almost everywhere you look. This is big government. This has, of course, always been how Jeremy Corbyn and the hugely influential Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell think the country should be run. That's why for so long they were the rebels in their own party. There is nothing new for them in the broad principles they have laid out today. What they are gambling on, and many in their own party are really sceptical of, is whether a 21st century version of the beliefs they have stood by for so long can find favour with the country at large. Certainly the country faces big challenges. Clearly, many public services are stretched after years of a squeeze on public spending. There is no question that Jeremy Corbyn's transformation of the Labour Party has shifted the whole political compass round to the left. But that doesn't mean Labour can be confident at all that it means the country is hungry for a total reboot of the kind the party is promising. Polls at this stage suggest that most people are not that enthusiastic about change in such a dramatic way. Voters might like the idea of what one senior Labour figure simply described as 'lots of free stuff'. Perhaps the manifesto today could be the start of a breakthrough in this campaign. But there are doubts tonight about whether the plans are realistic, and whether the public would be willing in anything like enough numbers to put their trust in Mr Corbyn to make it happen.

"The Labour Party has launched its 2019 election manifesto, with the slogan It's Time For Real Change. It sets out the policies the party aims to introduce should it win the election. Thefull document,externalruns to 105 pages. But what are the promises that will grab the public's attention, and potentially win over voters on polling day, 12 December? The party also wants to cut private provision in the NHS. The 4.3% per year rise is at the top end of what health think tanks and analysts have been calling for. Labour would also have to find money to cover revenue lost from its pledges to scrap prescription, basic dentistry and hospital car parking charges. A key section covers Labour's plan to cut private provision in the NHS, which currently accounts for about 7% of the health budget in England. This would clearly involve outsourced contracts, for example for physiotherapy and community health. But will NHS hospitals suddenly see their waiting lists balloon as a result of operations outsourced to private hospitals being brought back into the public sector? And are these pledges longer-term aspirations or shorter-term priorities? Healthcare is devolved so these policies would apply to England only, but the devolved nations would benefit from the funding. This video can not be played ""Rail, mail, water and energy into public ownership"": Jeremy Corbyn launches Labour's manifesto Labour will renegotiate a new Brexit deal within three months, and hold a referendum on the deal or Remain within six months The short section called ""The Final Say on Brexit"" only begins on page 89 of this manifesto. The other main UK-wide parties have simple slogans, but Labour's policy is more complicated and doesn't fit on a manifesto cover or the side of a bus. It promises to renegotiate a new Brexit deal within three months, based on a new UK-EU customs union and close EU single market alignment. It would also give EU nationals living and working in the UK the automatic right to stay. That deal would then be put to a legally-binding referendum within six months, alongside the option to remain in the EU. Labour wants to appeal to both Leavers and Remainers and to give the people the final say. It would implement the referendum result immediately. But Mr Corbyn will not say how he would vote in it. And that continues to divert attention away from his other practical policies. This policy would apply to the whole of the UK. Update: On 22 November Jeremy Corbyn revealed that he would remain neutral if there was another referendum. What is Labour's Brexit plan? Will this be a Brexit election? It would boost anyone over the age of 25 earning the minimum wage, known as the National Living Wage. The Conservatives had already announced the living wage would gradually increase to Â£10.50 over the next six years. Labour is now promising more and faster, with all workers over 16 years old getting Â£10 an hour within the next year. It is an attempt to tackle the growing issue of in-work poverty. It's cheaper than other policy announcements because employers, rather than government, mostly pay the wages, but it's a big jump for them to swallow in a very short timeframe. Labour is also promising extra measures to boost workers' rights, including longer maternity and paternity pay, and guaranteed bereavement pay. This would apply to the whole of the UK. How high could the lowest wages go? Is the minimum wage enough to live on? Pension age would remain at 66 while retirement ages for those in arduous and stressful jobs will be reviewed. Not long ago, government number-crunchers suggested workers under 30 may not receive a state pension until they turned 70. So Labour's plan to freeze the state pension age at 66 for the foreseeable future has been called a ""gargantuan promise"" by one analyst. It would cost billions of pounds more than most recent government plans to raise the age for men and women to 68 by 2039. Yet, it would clearly be popular among middle-age voters. For existing pensioners, the so-called triple-lock - linking annual state pension rises to the highest of average earnings, the cost of living, or 2.5% - would continue, as all the major parties have promised. There are also pitches to specific groups. The so-called Waspi women - born in the 1950s and furious with ""surprise"" pension age changes - are promised compensation. This would apply to the whole of the UK. The fight over women's pensions Why 70 may be the new 65 Provide ""community-based, person-centred"" support in England, including free personal care. Labour's plan for a comprehensive National Care Service is bold. The question will be whether their costings stand-up to scrutiny. That is not just about the affordability of the plan now, but also its cost as the population ages. At the heart of the policy is free personal care for older people who need help with day-to-day tasks like washing, dressing and medication. This system already operates in Scotland, but in England, the idea was rejected 20 years ago by the then-Labour government as too expensive. There are also promises to double the number of people receiving help, so easing NHS pressures. Plans to reform the care system have ended up as political footballs in past elections - the challenge for Labour will be building a consensus around their ideas. Health and social care is devolved. This would apply to England only. Will Jeremy Corbyn's long march lead to power? To put the UK on track for a net-zero carbon energy system within the 2030s. The date for reducing carbon emissions to effectively zero is much sooner than the government envisages. It's not quite the neat formulation of ""net zero"" by 2030 that many party activists wanted (and the Green Party has promised). Instead, in one line, the document talks of achieving ""the substantial majority of our emissions reductions"" by 2030. In another, it mentions putting the UK ""on track for a net-zero carbon energy system within the 2030s"". Presumably that creates enough stretch room to get to 2040 - five years earlier than the Lib Dems' target year and 10 years earlier than the Tories. This policy would apply to the whole of the UK CONFUSED?Our simple election guide,external POLICY GUIDE:Who should I vote for?,external POLLS:How are the parties doing?,external A TO Z:Our tool to explain election words,external BREXIT:Where do the parties stand? The party will nationalise the so-called big six energy firms, National Grid, the water industry, Royal Mail, railways and the broadband arm of BT. Labour's manifesto is one of the most radical proposed overhauls of the way companies are owned and run in decades. It would mark the biggest ownership takeover by the state since the nationalisations that occurred after the outbreak of World War Two. Those companies that Labour does not want to own and operate themselves will also face a huge change in the way they are supervised by government. The current inhabitants of company boardrooms are very aware life would be very different under a Labour government. This policy would apply to the whole of the UK. How much could Labour's nationalisation plan cost? Start work on a new benefits system to replace controversial benefit. Labour's plan to scrap Universal Credit deals with its immediate concerns about the much-criticised benefit. However, the party does not say what it would replace it with. Universal Credit was originally introduced to tackle the complexity and unfairness of the existing benefits system. But many of the accompanying changes became linked to austerity measures like benefit caps. Going back to the system which Universal Credit replaced would create its own problems. And its introduction shows just how difficult it can be to devise a new system that works. Labour has said it will start work on ideas for a new system immediately, but getting that right is likely to take years. This would apply across the UK. There are also plans to scrap tuition fees and bring back maintenance grants for the poorest students. The controversial policy of abolishing private schools, voted through at conference, is being parked for the moment. But there is a firm commitment to remove their charitable tax status. The big pledge, as in 2017, is the abolition of tuition fees. Universities will worry that the commitment to find public money to replace them could come under pressure if public finances tighten. Scrapping tuition fees will benefit the wealthiest students most. Maintenance grants would be restored for the poorest. The combined cost is estimated at Â£12bn a year. On school funding, Labour's promise goes further than the Conservatives and Lib Dems. By 2022-2023, spending would be Â£10.5bn higher in cash terms, which would reverse cuts (and then some) made since 2010. Education is devolved. This would apply to England only. Labour will also bring the railways back into public ownership. Labour says it will bring the railways back into public ownership when the current rail franchises expire. The party says that means there will be no cost to the government as the contracts will have ended. However, it is unclear who will then own the trains and the associated costs. The use of driver-only operated trains will also be stopped, having caused years of disruption because of industrial action by disgruntled staff. Industry estimates this would cost more than Â£200m a year. And the bus system will fall under council control again while thousands of routes that have been cut will be reinstated. Free bus travel is also promised for under-25s. The costs for this are not provided in the manifesto. Labour promises a Â£250bn green transformation fund; HS2 will be built and extended into Scotland and long-suffering train passengers in the north of England will get ""Crossrail for the North"". Transport is partly devolved. Free bus travel for under-25s would apply to England only, while infrastructure projects and renationalisation would apply across the UK. It will mean EU citizens in the UK no longer have to apply to continue living and working in the country. The settlement scheme was set up by the Conservative government to formalise the rights of EU citizens to continue living and working in the UK after Brexit. Ministers have claimed the system is working well with applications from around 2.45 million people so far. But that means almost one million EU nationals have yet to sign up, raising concerns that some who have difficulty proving they've been in Britain could be at risk of deportation. Labour's proposal would end the worry and uncertainty for EU citizens in Britain, but it could create problems for border staff after Brexit in distinguishing between those who've already been living in the UK and new arrivals who may have certain restrictions. This policy would apply to the whole of the UK. Start a rapid programme of homebuilding. Labour's promise to build 100,000 council homes and 50,000 housing association properties a year by the end of the five-year Parliament marks a rapid change. Building on this scale has not been seen for 40 years. The UK's population is getting older and one in five people has a disability, so the type of homes proposed will face close scrutiny.  There are also questions over the availability of construction workers to build them. More people have rented from private landlords than social ones since 2013. Many are aged under 35. For them, rent controls would aim to keep down costs by linking rent rises to inflation (the cost of living) and giving city authorities the power to be even stricter. This will reignite debate over their effectiveness. The plan for a new Department for Housing shows how central this area is to Labour's key policies. Housing is devolved so this policy would apply to England only.

"This video can not be played Grace Millaneâs father David paid tribute to his daughter and said her murder had ""ripped apart"" the family A man who strangled a British backpacker and hid her body inside a suitcase has been found guilty of murder. Grace Millane was found buried in bushland outside Auckland, New Zealand. A jury at the city's high court rejected claims by the 27-year-old man, who cannot be named, that she died accidentally during ""rough sex"". Ms Millane's parents David and Gillian wept in the public gallery as jurors convicted their daughter's killer. The murder trial that gripped a nation He showed no emotion as the verdict - reached after about five hours of deliberations - was read out. University of Lincoln graduate Grace Millane was on a round-the-world trip at the time of her death Justice Simon Moore said the defendant would be sentenced on 21 February next year. The identity of Grace Millane's murderer cannot be disclosed for now due to a court suppression order that bans media from naming and picturing him. The purpose in New Zealand courts is to protect people not yet proven guilty - but also to have a fairer trial by ensuring the jury is not prejudiced by media coverage. Images can also be withheld. Justice Simon Moore ordered that the suppression order which prevents naming the defendant would remain in place indefinitely until lifted by the court. Mr and Mrs Millane, who had flown to New Zealand to attend the trial, said the verdict would be ""welcomed by every member of the family and friends of Grace"". Her family described Miss Millane as ""our sunshine"" Speaking outside the court, an emotional Mr Millane said the family's lives had been ""ripped apart"" by his daughter's ""barbaric"" murder. ""Grace was our sunshine and she will be missed forever,"" he said. Jurors heard the defendant and Ms Millane had met via the Tinder dating app on 1 December last year, the night before Ms Millane's 22nd birthday. They spent several hours drinking cocktails in bars around Auckland before going to the defendant's hotel. In the hours before she disappeared Miss Millane and the defendant were seen in the Sky City Development Ms Millane, from Wickford, Essex, was found in the mountainous WaitÄkere Ranges a week later. Suspect 'went on date while body in room' CCTV 'shows accused wheeling body in suitcase' 'Solo backpacking didn't kill Grace' Prosecutors said post-mortem examinations found bruises ""consistent with restraint"" on her body, and that she had been strangled. On the night of her death, the court heard, the defendant ""wasn't distressed or concerned by her death"", and set about making plans to dispose of her remains. He ""sexualised"" the killing by searching for pornography, stopping at one point to take lewd photos of her corpse, prosecutors said. This video can not be played Grace Millane's last movements were captured on CCTV The following day, he went on a Tinder date with another woman while the body of Ms Millane remained in the hotel room. He had bought a second suitcase in a bid to cover his tracks, as well as cleaning products and a shovel, jurors heard. The defendant did not give evidence in his defence. The killer's identity is suppressed under New Zealand law Following the verdict, the step-brother of the murderer spoke to television station TVNZ reporter Paul Hobbs. The man, who also cannot be named for legal reasons, said he initially thought Miss Millane's death could have been an accident but when he saw the timeline of events, his view changed. His step-brother, he said, was ""a pathological liar that lies over pointless things and continues to lie until the point where he's got no out - absolutely no out -  and then he just breaks down and cries and runs away. ""It's just absolutely terrible that a life had to be lost because of it."" He said he did not think his step-brother intended to kill Grace, but said: ""In that moment he just kept goingâ¦ and he took Grace's life."" In an interview with police, shown during the trial, the defendant was seen to break down in tears. ""His tears, to me, they're more tears for himself."" Apologising to the Millane family, he added: ""I'm just so, so incredibly sorry for their loss. ""To know it's one of our family members - even though it's not our actions - it's very difficult, and I can't imagine the pain and hurt and what [the Millane family] had to go through for a court hearingâ¦ to me that's all because he doesn't have any shred of a decent human being inside him, and couldn't just confess to the fact he murdered her."" Tinder said it was ""deeply saddened"" by the case and ""its thoughts were with the victim's loved ones"". A spokesperson added that it was not planning to review its policies in the light of the murder but said ""the safety of our members is a top priority"" and that they were exploring new updates and technologies to enhance its safety efforts around the world. Ms Millane's death prompted an outpouring of public grief in New Zealand with the country's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern apologising to her family.

"This video can not be played Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage makes election pitch Nigel Farage has unveiled the Brexit Party's general election policies, promising a ""political revolution that puts ordinary people first"". The party leader pledged to halve the foreign aid budget, abolish the House of Lords and cap permanent immigration at 50,000 a year. The Brexit Party is running in 275 seats, after deciding to stand down in the 317 won by the Tories in 2017. It is also promising a ""clean break"" from all EU institutions. LIVE: Latest updates from the election campaign How much does a general election cost? What are the Brexit Party's key policies? Speaking in London, Mr Farage said his party would scrap VAT on fuel bills and stop companies earning less than Â£10,000 a year paying corporation tax. He promised millions of trees would be planted to absorb carbon emissions. Mr Farage said his party would save tens of billions of pounds by redirecting foreign aid, scrapping the HS2 rail project and stopping the UK's contributions to the EU. He also claimed the party could recover Â£7bn from the UK's share of capital at the European Investment Bank. Mr Farage said he favoured making civil servants sign a ""pledge of political neutrality"" and devising ""political guidelines"" for the Supreme Court. He added that any Brexit Party MPs elected would ""hold Boris Johnson to his word"" over Brexit, and act as ""new radicals"" in Parliament to ""change politics for good"". Mr Farage accused the Conservatives of having ""no intention"" of reducing immigration numbers, as firms that supported them wanted ""cheap labour"". ""We would very much want to get immigration numbers down to what for 60 years were very acceptable and very workable post-war levels,"" he said. ""Yes, I'm talking around about 50,000 people a year."" Mr Farage added that work permits would give ""flexibility"" to the system, as there was a difference between permanent settlement and allowing workers to come for a ""time-limited period"". Other pledges include:,external Introducing a ban on exporting waste to other countries for it to be burned Providing free ""base level"" broadband for deprived regions, and free wi-fi on all public transport Abolishing business rates for shops outside the M25, funded by a ""small online sales tax"" Scrapping all interest on student loans, and abolishing inheritance tax Phasing out the BBC licence fee Limiting postal voting to people who are elderly, infirm or overseas Several other political parties have launched traditional manifestos - outlining policy commitments for government - this week, but Mr Farage and his colleagues have declined to do so. The former UKIP leader, who is not standing as a candidate in the election, said manifestos were a ""means of telling people what they want to hear without ever having the genuine desire to implement them"". Instead, he said his party would be making a ""contract with the people,external"" containing a ""targeted set of deliverable pledges"". The Brexit Party has changed its tune on, yes, Brexit. Until a few weeks ago its leader, Nigel Farage was saying a no-deal Brexit was the ""only acceptable deal"". But this ""contract"" moves the goalposts. Gone is the criticism of Boris Johnson's withdrawal agreement - now the party simply promises there will be ""no extended transition period"" after Brexit. Without saying so explicitly in this document, the Brexit Party is warning that it will campaign to ensure Mr Johnson sticks to his promise not to extend the transition any further. Read more here Brexit:The Conservatives say they will deliver Brexit by the end of January 2020 under the terms of the PM's deal negotiated with the EU. The Liberal Democrats have vowed to cancel Brexit if elected as a majority government, or otherwise campaign for a referendum including the option of staying in the EU. Labour wants to renegotiate the PM's Brexit deal then put it to a referendum within six months, with the option of staying in the EU. The party has not said which side it would take in such a vote. The SNP wants Scotland to stay in the EU. Immigration:Labour has not set a target in its manifesto, but has pledged to regulate the labour market to stop the ""undercutting of wages and conditions"". For the Tories, Home Secretary Priti Patel has previously said overall immigration should come down, but not according to an ""arbitrary"" target. Boris Johnson has promised to reduce unskilled migration. The SNP says cutting immigration would damage the Scottish economy. Trees:The Conservatives have said they will plant 30 million trees a year by 2025 if they win the election. The Liberal Democrats have pledged to plant twice as many trees in the same period. Labour has promised an ""ambitious programme of tree planting"", including a forest of a million trees to help the NHS become carbon neutral.

"Barbara Taylor Bradford said period TV dramas since A Woman of Substance were ""junk"" Barbara Taylor Bradford's blockbuster A Woman of Substance sold millions of copies and became a mini-series that is still Channel 4's most-watched show. Now, the author is writing a new novel that revisits the story - but from a different point of view. The 1979 original followed Emma Harte from Yorkshire maid to business giant. The new book will return to the young Emma's era, but telling the story of her friend Blackie O'Neill - played by a young Liam Neeson in the TV version. Jenny Seagrove as young Emma and Liam Neeson as Blackie in the 1985 TV version ""I'm in the in the process of creating a life for Blackie which we never saw in A Woman of Substance,"" she told BBC News. The 86-year-old author was inspired to write Blackie and Emma while at her husband Robert's bedside in hospital. She had been due to write a third instalment in her House of Falconer saga instead, but was unable to do the required research. Robert, a film producer, died in July. ""I was sitting there, my mind wandering and knowing what was going to happen, and trying to think, what can I write that will beâ¦ no book is easy, but what would be easier than having to do a load of research? And I suddenly thought of Blackie. ""My editor said that was Bob's gift to me. He made me think of Blackie as a book."" Part of the new novel acts as a prequel to A Woman of Substance, following Blackie from 13-year-old orphan in Ireland until he meets Emma Harte on a Yorkshire moor. The story then runs in parallel to the original, following Blackie's fortunes rather than Emma's. Deborah Kerr as an older Emma at the head of the table ""Where does he go? What does he do? Is he really a good man? Has he any troubles? Has he had other women? It's really Blackie's book,"" the Yorkshire-born writer said. A Woman of Substance has sold 30 million copies, according to Bradford's official biography, and spawned six sequels.

"The new Tory policy would mainly affect the London property market Foreigners buying properties in England will be forced to pay 3% more in stamp duty than UK residents, if the Conservatives win the general election. The party claim it will help people get on the housing ladder by taking the heat out of the property market. The government was already planning a 1% hike for foreign buyers. Labour is also proposing a levy on ""overseas companies buying housing"", and wants to give local people ""first dibs"" on homes built in their area. Currently, foreign individuals and companies can buy homes as easily as UK residents - but there are longstanding concerns about properties being bought as investments and standing empty, particularly in upmarket areas of London. The Conservatives quote a study saying 13% of homes in London were bought by overseas buyers between 2014 and 2016. Labour and Tories push rival housing policies Research last year bythe King's College Business School,externalsuggested foreign buyers did not just push up prices at the high-end of the property market, but there was a ""trickle down"" effect to less expensive properties, and that cities outside London also felt the effect. The Conservative government announced a consultation for a 1% levy on stamp duty for buyers who are not tax resident in the UK in February. But a study for Labour's London Mayor Sadiq Khan said the figure was not high enough, pointing to other cities with large numbers of foreign buyers - such as Vancouver and Singapore, which both have a 20% surcharge. The Conservatives are now proposing a surcharge of 3%, to be paid in addition to all other stamp duty charges. They estimate the measure will affect about 70,000 transactions a year, raising Â£120m, which the party would direct at programmes tackling rough sleeping. When he was London mayor,Boris Johnson said it would be wrongto ""slam the door on the right of overseas residents to buy homes in London - notwithstanding the effect they may have in some parts of prime London on the market"". Announcing the new policy, Chief Secretary to the Treasury Rishi Sunak said: ""Evidence shows that by adding significant amounts of demand to limited housing supply, purchases by non-residents inflate house prices."" He said the UK would ""always be open to people coming to live, work, and build a life in this great country"", adding: ""The steps we are taking will ensure that more people have the opportunity of a great place to live and build a family."" Polly Neate, chief executive of housing charity Shelter, welcomed the commitment to invest in services to support rough sleepers. ""Rough sleeping has been rising for the last decade and frontline services need all the support they can get to help tackle this mounting issue,"" she said. ""At the same time, however, we can't solve homelessness without tackling the root of the housing crisis, and that means an investment in the social homes we so desperately need. ""We want the next government to deliver at least 90,000 new social homes a year over the next parliament to help end this emergency."" The main parties have set out competing proposals to address the UK's housing shortage, ahead of 12 December's general election. On BBC One and on iPlayer from 19:00-21:00 GMT On BBC News Channel and on iPlayer 18.30-22.00 GMT, with specialist correspondents and extra spin room analysis On the BBC Newswebsite live page Read ourguide to the Question Time special Labour said it would embark on the biggest house-building programme since the 1960s, including 100,00 new council houses a year by 2024. The Conservatives announced measures to help first-time buyers and boost private house building, promising a million homes over the next five years. The Lib Dems set out plans for 300,000 new properties a year - a third of which would be social rented homes. The party also said it would also tackle ""wasted vacant housing stock"" by allowing local authorities to increase council tax by up to 500% where homes are left empty for more than six months. They also want to launch a rent-to-own scheme, which would see social tenants build up an equity stake in their homes over 30 years.

"The Conservatives have raised Â£5.7m in the first week of the official election campaign, according to the Electoral Commission. The Tories received 87% of registered donations in that period, figures show, while Labour raised a total of Â£218,500. The Lib Dems received Â£275,000, whilst the Brexit Party raised Â£250,000. But the figures do not represent all donations, as only those above Â£7,500 have to be reported. The biggest gift to the Tories was Â£1.5m from theatre producer and regular donor John Gore. Meanwhile, the largest single registered donation to Labour was Â£62,000 from the Unite union, led by Jeremy Corbyn ally Len McCluskey. Labour fined Â£12,500 by Electoral Commission Bequests to Tories exceed members' income BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the figures showed an ""astonishing gap in fundraising"". The discrepancy between the two main parties is even wider than in the first week of the 2017 campaign, when the Tories raised Â£4.1m in comparison to the Â£2.7m received by Labour. In addition, BBC political correspondent Chris Mason said he understood the Conservatives had raised more than Â£4m in unregistered smaller donations since the beginning of the election campaign. This is four times the Â£1m in small donations - averaging Â£26 each - that Labour says it has received over the same period. In the first week of the current campaign, the Green Party raised Â£30,000 in registered donations - half the Â£60,000 raised by the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland. This is the first UK-wide election when pre-poll donations and loan reports have been published for parties in Northern Ireland. Money received during the other weeks of the five-week official election campaign will be detailed in later releases. For Labour, 70% of registered donations came from unions. For the Conservatives, 47% of the party's donations came from individuals, with the remainder coming from companies. The party received Â£500,000 from investment firm WA Capital and the same from property company Countywide Developments. Another Tory donor, Lubov Chernukhin, the wife of a former minister for Russian President Vladimir Putin, gave Â£200,000 in the same period. The biggest donor to the Lib Dems was wealth management firm Attestor Services, which gave Â£75,000. Financier Jeremy Hosking, a former donor to the Vote Leave campaign, was the biggest donor to the Brexit Party with Â£250,000. Where are the seats that could turn the election?

"Williamson caught at gully off Curran after making half-century England bowled out for 353 Southee took four wickets as England slipped from 277-4 to 295-8 Stokes (91) falls to excellent slip catch by Taylor First of two Tests; Play can go on until 05:30 GMT Jack Skelton, Callum Matthews and Amy Lofthouse That's us done for today. Thanks for your company. You can read Marc Higginson's report overhere. You'll be able to download the latest Test Match Special podcast later onhere. The full scorecard is availablehere. We'll see you at 21:30 for day three. BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra Australia are in complete control against Pakistan at the Gabba and they are about to pass Pakistan's total of 240. Although they have finally lost their first wicket as Joe Burns has just been bowled by Yasir Shah. You can listen to that one overhere. Stuart Broad:0-20 off 10 overs Jofra Archer:0-40 off 14 overs Sam Curran:2-28 off 10 overs Jack Leach:1-29 off 12 overs Ben Stokes:1-16 off four overs Joe Root:0-2 off one over More from England's Jack Leach:""There hasn't been much spin yet. That could change, it's sunny and warm and the wicket is starting to get dry so hopefully come day four or five there may be more spin. ""I'm trying to do a job first innings, contain them and let the pace lads do the work but I'm trying to build pressure and take wickets as well. ""We'll be looking to get a lead. It's a big first hour, if we can get a couple of early wickets we might be able to get a lead of 100 or 150."" Henry Nicholls and BJ Watling saw New Zealand to close at 144-4 - 209 runs behind. There was still time for Nicholls to be hit on the helmet by a well-directed Jofra Archer bouncer. Sam Curran got the prize scalp of Kane Williamson with a brilliant rising delivery that went off  the New Zealand captain's glove to Ben Stokes at first slip. Jeet Raval and Ross Taylor both fell to poor strokes off Jack Leach and Ben Stokes respectively as England chipped away and started to earn control. Sam Curran came on first change and struck in his first over as he Tom Latham lbw for eight. Latham should have reviewed however, as he got a thin inside edge but despite a brief consultation with Jeet Raval the opener walked. Stuart Broad then fell quickly as England were bowled out for 353. It was a total they would have been disappointed with having 202-3 and then 277-4 but on a pitch that's starting to look two-paced it may yet be a good total. Jos Buttler and Jack Leach then shared 52 for the ninth wicket as they hauled England towards 350. Jos Buttler was eventually caught on the deep point fence in slightly bizarre circumstances as Mitchell Santner jumped back over the advertising boards after signing some autographs as Neil Wagner was running in. That started a collapse of 4-18 in 21 balls as Ollie Pope was caught behind playing a loose drive, Sam Curran was trapped lbw first ball and Jofra Archer was caught in the slips. Ben Stokes and Ollie Pope resumed with England on 241-4. They added 36 in the first 10 overs of the day's play before a spectacular catch at first slip from Ross Taylor saw the end of Stokes. Right, let's have a recap of the day's action. England's Jack Leach:""It was a good day. We would have liked an extra wicket at the end. If we can get a couple early, we'll be right on top. ""The ball from Sam Curran to get Kane Williamson misbehaved and that's a good sign when you've got runs on the board. ""We would have liked to have got more runs, we were aiming for at least 400. We wanted that big score and we wanted a century in there and that's something we're working hard to do. Hopefully that'll come in the second innings."" New Zealand's Tim Southee:""It would have been nice to be three down tonight but we've still got batting to come. We just need some partnerships and eke out some more runs. ""I thought we bowled well yesterday and we got our rewards for that today. We would have taken 6-112 at the start of the day. ""Test cricket challenges you physically as well as mentally. You've got to take 20 wickets to win Tests, you've just got to keep coming as a bowler. ""We'll turn up tomorrow, approach the first session and then reassess where we are at lunch and then the same at tea."" Jonathan AgnewBBC cricket correspondent A compelling day really. It's been a hard-fought battle out there. When you see the sort of ball that dismissed Kane Williamson, England's 353 might not be that bad. England will be happier at the end of the day than they were halfway through it. And BJ Watling gets in behind to defend. That's it for day two of the first Test at Mount Mauganui. New Zealand walk off on 144-4, trailing England by 209 runs. Henry Nicholls returns the favour, tickling it round the corner for one. BJ Watling to face the final ball of the day... BJ Watling taps a single. Henry Nicholls had to face that brutal Jofra Archer over and now has to see out the rest of this over. Cheers, mate.

"Prince Andrew was photographed leaving Buckingham Palace on Thursday evening The Duke of York has been seen for the first time since he announced he would step back from royal duties over the Jeffrey Epstein scandal. Prince Andrew said on Wednesday he wouldwithdraw from his official role for the ""foreseeable future"". Criticism of the prince's ties to convicted US sex offender Epstein intensified amid a growing backlash following a BBC interview. Lawyers for Epstein's victims have urged the prince to speak to US police. The prince was seen by photographers on Thursday morning driving out of his home in Windsor, Berkshire, and was later spotted leaving Buckingham Palace. The Duke of York's ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, whodefended him as a ""true and real gentleman"",externala day before the Newsnight interview was broadcast, was also seen being driven into the grounds of Buckingham Palace. Earlier in the day he was spotted driving out of his home in Windsor Prince Andrew's ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, was also seen being driven into the grounds of Buckingham Palace on Thursday Meanwhile, more organisations have announced they are cutting ties with the Duke of York. TheUniversity of Huddersfield said the prince was stepping down with immediate effect from his role as chancellor. The Association of Leading Visitor Attractions - which represents tourist sites such as museums, galleries and historic houses across the UK - said the prince was no longer its president. And the Outward Bound Trust - a network of outdoor education schools - said it had accepted his resignation as patron. Companies including BT and Barclays and other institutionshad already distanced themselves from the prince. Prince Andrew became a full-time working member of the Royal Family following his retirement from the Royal Navy. The announcement that he would be stepping down from public duties, described by Buckingham Palace as ""a personal decision"", was taken following discussions with the Queen and Prince Charles. Prince Andrew quits as university chancellor Prince Andrew stepping back from royal duties Entrepreneurs who back Prince Andrew's Pitch@Palace Six things we learned from the duke's interview The retirement of the Duke of Edinburgh from public life in 2017 is the most recent example of where a working royal has stepped back from their duties. Although under very different circumstances, in Prince Philip's case, some of his long-held patronages have been passed to other family members. The Duchess of Cambridge and the Countess of Wessex were among the royals to take on his former patronages. The prince's access to public money to fund travel and expenses will end. For example, a three-day visit to Bahrain by the prince on behalf of the UK government in April 2018cost Â£16,272,external, paid for by the taxpayer-funded Sovereign Grant. The Sovereign Grant is public moneywhich pays for the cost of official royal duties,external, in exchange for the surrender by the Queen of the revenue from the Crown Estate. Prince Andrew will step back from royal duties for the foreseeable future There is also an annual payment to the prince from the Privy Purse - the Queen's private income - recorded in 2011 as being Â£249,000. Asked about whether this funding would continue, Buckingham Palace said only that the Duke of York's office was funded privately by the Queen. The prince has been urged to put himself forward to be interviewed by US investigators who are looking into allegations against Jeffrey Epstein. In his statement on Wednesday, Prince Andrew said he was ""willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations, if required"". David Boies, a lawyer representing Virginia Giuffre and other accusers, said the prince's withdrawal from his royal duties was ""a positive first step towards taking responsibility for his actions"". ""A second positive step would be to agree to be interviewed by the lawyers representing the victims of Jeffrey Epstein,"" he added. The prince said he regretted this 2010 meeting with Epstein Gloria Allred, who represents some of Epstein's accusers, told BBC Newsnight that she was ""glad"" it appeared the prince was willing to co-operate. But she asked: ""Is he insisting that he be served with a subpoena to testify, or is he willing to speak to law enforcement without being legally required to do so? ""My clients who are victims of Jeffrey Epstein have spoken to law enforcement without being 'required' to do so."" Another US lawyer for several Epstein accusers, Lisa Bloom, who is Ms Allred's daughter, said she would be prepared to serve legal papers on the prince in the UK, compelling him to give sworn testimony. Ms Bloom said it appeared the prince may have crucial information on Epstein's alleged crimes and that she would be willing to serve him with legal papers compelling him to give sworn testimony. Virginia Giuffre claimed she was forced to have sex with the prince three times. The prince has always denied any form of sexual contact or relationship with her. It is now unlikely that Prince Andrew will attend events or make trips in his capacity as the Queen's third child. Other working royals are expected to take over Prince Andrew's commitments in the short term. It is likely the prince's private office at Buckingham Palace, which helps him keep his official diary, will reduce in size. This video can not be played Prince Andrew: Epstein 'a constant sore in the family' But it will not be a complete retirement for Prince Andrew. It is understood the prince will continue to support his entrepreneur programme, Pitch@Palace,although it will take place separately from the palace. Prince Andrew's attendance at Royal Family engagements, such as the Trooping of the Colour, Remembrance Sunday or Christmas at the family's estate in Sandringham, Norfolk, is not thought to be affected. This is without precedent in modern times. Prince Andrew's public life is over for now. The statement says the withdrawal is ""for the foreseeable future"". But it's hard to see what will bring him back. The interview is almost universally seen as a mistake. It was a disaster. But it may have seemed a good idea at the time. BBC Panorama has been digging into Virginia Giuffre's allegations and is going to air soon. That will have added to the pressure, alongside legal efforts in New York to have more Epstein-related papers released. There's talk of a lack of grip at the Palace, but Buckingham Palace is not like a company or a government department, with reporting lines and a chain of command. For centuries princes have gone their own way. There are lots of questions - about money, titles, military commands, patronages, about how this might speed reform, and of course about whether Prince Andrew still has a part to play in helping with investigations into Epstein, and helping Epstein's victims find answers. But right now the humiliation is complete. Born into the public eye, Prince Andrew has had to retreat into a private life. And the monarchy is shaken. Prince Andrew & the Epstein Scandal: The Newsnight Interview was shown on BBC Two on 16 November 2019 and can be seen onBBC iPlayerin the UK. The full interview can also be seen onYouTube.

"Emilia Clarke's role as Daenerys Targaryen in Game of Thrones initially required her to take her clothes off Directors UK has published its first guidelines for scenes involving nudity and simulated sex. The body that represents UK TV and film directors is aiming to show best practice for working with actors, intimacy coordinators, and others. The news comes a day after Emilia Clarke said shefound Game of Thrones' nude scenes ""hard""and that she was pressured to go naked in other roles. ""Everyone deserves the right to feel safe at work,"" Directors UK said. ""This is just as true when working on a Hollywood blockbuster as it is on a prime-time drama or a debut short film."" The new guidelines, which are supported by industry bodies including Bafta, Equity, the BFI and the Casting Directors' Guild, come in the wake of the#MeToo movementand allegations that some bosses demanded sexual favours for acting work. The guidelines advise a ban on full nudity in any audition or call back and no semi-nudity in first auditions. The document states that ""by their nature, auditions are based on a power imbalance"", and that ""some performers can feel obligated to agree to uncomfortable requests to get a job"".
