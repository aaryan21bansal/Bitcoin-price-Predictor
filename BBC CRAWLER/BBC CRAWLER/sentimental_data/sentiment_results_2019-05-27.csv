"Aston Villa will return to the top flight after a three-year absence Aston Villa won promotion to the Premier League and secured an estimated Â£170m windfall as they held off a late Derby County fightback to win the Championship play-off final at Wembley. Villa,beaten by Fulhamin last season's final, seemed to be cruising to victory when John McGinn added to Anwar El Ghazi's first-half strike to put them 2-0 up with 30 minutes to go. However, Rams boss Frank Lampard threw caution to the wind and his side set up a frantic finale when substitute Jack Marriott's effort from eight yards took a deflection off Martyn Waghorn on its way in. Despite seven minutes of injury time they could not force an equaliser and now face another season in the second tier, while Villa return to the Premier League for the first time since relegation in 2016. Promotion at Wembley caps off a remarkable three months for Villa who had looked out of the promotion race before a club-record 10-match winning run saw them finish fifth. Perhaps unsurprisinglygiven the value of the game,the first half was a cagey affair. Rams midfielder Mason Mount was the first player to register a shot on target when he fired straight at Villa keeper Jed Steer from 20 yards late in the half. Phil McNulty: Smith proves perfect fit for Villa,external Villa potential 'massive' after promotion - Smith Lampard expects to stay at Derby despite Wembley loss Relive Villa's play-off final victory at Wembley How did you rate the players? With the game drifting towards the break goalless, Dean Smith's side launched a quick attack that El Ghazi finished off by coming in on the blindside of the static Jayden Bogle and diverting it into the net with his back. They doubled their advantage when Rams goalkeeper Kelle Roos misjudged the flight of a deflected El Ghazi shot and McGinn beat him to it to head into an empty net. That sparked Derby into life and they grew into the game before the combination of forwards Marriott and Waghorn got them back in it. But it was not enough and they now face a 12th successive season in the Championship. Victory at the national stadium brings a successful end to what has been at times a tumultuous year for Villa. Days after defeat by Fulham in last season's Championship showpiece it was revealed the club had missed a deadline to pay HM Revenue & Customs Â£4m and it seemed likely that star player Jack Grealish would have to be sold. With administration a serious concern, Chinese owner Tony Xia eventually sold the club to billionaire businessmen Wes Edens and Nassef Sawiris in July. They decided to stick with boss Steve Bruce until October, but after an indifferent start to the season, sacked the 58-year-old after a 3-3 draw with Preston, which had seen an irate fan throw a cabbage at him. Dean Smith's decision to make Jack Grealish Villa captain in March paid dividends Bruce was replaced in the dugout by Brentford manager and Villa fan Smith, with former Chelsea and Villa defender John Terry as assistant, and results initially improved. However, following an injury to midfielder Grealish at the start of December the team went on a torrid run of form and by the end of February they were eight points off the play-offs, having played two games more than some teams around them. Grealish returned to the side and was made captain for the home game against Derby on 1 March. The 23-year-old scored the fourth goal in a 4-0 win over the Rams which sparked a run of 10 successive victories and Villa qualified for the play-offs with two games to spare. They squeezed past local rivals West Brom on penalties to set up a meeting with Derby, who they had beaten by an aggregate of 7-0 in their two league meetings this season. This game threatened to go the way of the past two games between the sides when the superb McGinn bundled in with Roos flapping. It proved to be a much closer finish but Villa managed to hang on to claim a promotion that boss Smith said felt ""surreal"". He said: ""Reality sets in now. Last time I was sat in a news conference after a Wembley final, I had lost 2-0 to Bristol City in the Johnstone's Paint Trophy final with Walsall (in 2015). ""It's no more that we deserve because the players have made history (with the winning run). ""The potential here is massive. It feels right we are a Premier League club because of the history and the fan base that we have."" Frank Lampard has just completed his first season as a manager Derby reached the play-offs in dramatic fashion, with two goals in the final 30 minutes of their final league game of the season against West Brom giving them the win they needed to guarantee sixth position. More drama was to follow in their semi-final against Leeds United, when the Rams became the first team in second-tier history to recover from losing the first leg at home to go on to reach the final, as they fought back to win an incredible match 4-2 at Elland Road. Their build-up to the Wembley showpiece was in danger of being disrupted as rumours grew about boss Lampard leaving to replace Maurizio Sarri as Chelsea manager. The former England international said before the game he would discuss his future with Rams owner Mel Morris after Monday regardless of the result, but suggested he expects to be at Pride Park next season. ""I haven't had any discussions with any other clubs,"" said Lampard. ""I'll be having talks with Mel on how we can compete next year. ""The talks are important in terms of where we go. I want to move forward."" He added that the Chelsea ""noise was irrelevant"" and that he had ""loved working here and I want to continue that and continue progressing with the club"". Derby, who also lost out in the 2014 Championship play-off final to QPR, failed to threaten the Villa defence until they had gone 2-0 down. They will surely be left to wonder 'what if?' after a spirited last 10 minutes nearly saw them grab a leveller to send the game to extra-time.

"France's far-right RN was jubilant: A narrow victory over Mr Macron's party If you're scratching your head right now, confused by conflicting interpretations of the European parliamentary election, fear not, just read on. Contrary to some stark political predictions ahead of the vote, the actual results seem nuanced. In France, for example, far-right candidate Marine Le Pen beat President Emmanuel Macron at the polls. A huge victory for her, right? And for the nationalist Eurosceptic cause, while Mr Macron clearly failed to persuade voters with his reform agenda for France and the EU. But the margin of difference was so small between the two politicians, you could argue the opposite: that Marine Le Pen failed to truly capitalise on the weakness of an unpopular president, allowing him to emerge post-election with feathers ruffled, but not plucked. If you forgive my unglamorous analogy. European election results LIVE Europe's biggest blocs lose grip on power European elections: What we know so far EU election results in maps and charts The European election results 2019 can be read in different ways. The nationalist right didn't sweep the board. Traditional governing parties were not all decimated, as some commentators had breathlessly predicted. But there were clear trends. The traditional centre-left and centre-right parties, which have dominated the EU as long as anyone can remember, appear to have lost their majority for the first time in the European Parliament. This reflects a tendency already apparent in national elections all over Europe: rejection of the status quo. Look at the beating meted out to France's centre-right and centre-left; to Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel and her Social Democrat coalition partners; plus the slap in the face delivered to the UK's Conservative and Labour parties. Europe's voters are looking elsewhere for answers. They're drawn to parties and political personalities they feel better represent their values and priorities. Some are attracted by the nationalist right, promising a crackdown on immigration and more power for national parliaments, rather than for Brussels. Italy's firebrand Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini is a successful example, as is Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. Other voters prefer a pro-European alternative, like the Green Party and liberal groups, which also performed well in these elections. Germany's Green Party doubled its share of the vote The new European Parliament will be broadly pro-EU but also fractured, making law-making and change difficult. Just when Europe's voters are screaming for change. Voter engagement is clear, looking at the higher-than-usual turnout figures. At a time driven by identity politics, people care. And they used these elections to send a strong message to their national governments. It's not certain that Angela Merkel's coalition will survive this latest humiliation, after months of losses in significant regional elections. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras is dissolving his government to hold snap elections, after a disastrous showing at the European level for his left-wing Syriza party. And Matteo Salvini, who dreams of being Italy's prime minister, will likely push for an early general election, after emerging triumphant from these elections. All of this could have an effect on Brexit too. Tied up with their own national political dramas, EU leaders are even less likely to be open to renegotiating the Brexit divorce deal, if asked to do so by the next UK prime minister. And how willing are they to implement the changes in EU priorities and focus that Europe's voters seem to clamour for? The political ""flavour"" of the next president of the European Commission (chosen by the European Parliament and EU leaders) will be a good indicator. EU leaders come to Brussels on Tuesday to discuss that post and a host of other influential EU jobs about to become vacant, like that of European Council President (the person who represents all EU member countries in Brussels, replacing Donald Tusk) and the presidency of the European Central Bank. The horse-trading has only just begun.

"The Brexit Party has won the largest share of the vote and the most seats in the UK's European elections. Many of its policies are unknown, it produced no manifesto, and it has avoided answering detailed questions on immigration or economic policy. One thing we do know very clearly is that it wants to leave the European Union as soon as possible. So what would a Brexit Party Brexit actually look like? The Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage says he wants a ""clean-break"" Brexit, abandoningthe withdrawal agreement that Theresa May's government negotiatedwith the EU. It is notable that Mr Farage tended to avoid the term ""no-deal"" Brexit during the election campaign. A party spokesman argued that it is a misleading term that gives a false impression. Without a withdrawal agreement, though, most of the vast network of rules and regulations that have governed the UK's relationship with the rest of Europe for more than 40 years, whether in trade or security or other issues, would disappear overnight. That's what a clean break would mean. Brexit basics: Free trade agreements explained What is the backstop? While arguing for a swift exit, the Brexit Party has also called for its newly elected MEPs to play a ""major role"" in the Brexit negotiations. But as the Brexit Party is not in government and has no MPs in the House of Commons that is highly unlikely. The only direct role Brexit Party MEPs might have is if the withdrawal agreement was ever to pass in the House of Commons - there would then be a vote in the European Parliament to ratify it. A clean break also means - and this was a promise that appeared on a pledge card the Brexit Party produced during the campaign - that it would refuse to pay the Â£39bn financial settlement, or ""divorce bill"", that the government has agreed in order to settle past debts and future obligations to the EU. And it means the party wants to leave the EU on - as it puts it -World Trade Organization (WTO) terms. It sounds very simple, and it is a phrase that is also used by several contenders for the Conservative Party leadership. But what does it mean in practice? Not a lot. The basic rules of the WTO are really just the baseline of international trade, which don't offer more than the most rudimentary of benefits. A lot of Brexit supporters - including the Brexit Party - argue that the UK can use something calledArticle 24 (of GATT - the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade)to ensure that the UK can still enjoy free or frictionless trade with the EU. It would mean no tariffs or taxes would be imposed on goods crossing borders between the UK and its largest trading partner, the European Union. The trouble with that argument is that you can only use Article 24 if two parties are willing to make an agreement - in this case, the UK and the EU. Neither can impose it on the other. In other words, you have to agree a deal first and the Brexit Party, along with several would-be Conservative leaders, are prepared to leave without a deal. Mr Farage argues that there will in fact be a deal of some kind because the EU needs one. He has been fond of saying that when push comes to shove the EU would ""come running"" to do a quick trade deal with the UK. That's quite a gamble. It is certainly true that any significant disruption to trade would hurt both sides, but the EU has said consistently that it values the integrity of itssingle marketmore than free trade with the UK, and that that will be its priority. Of course no deal or a ""clean break"" is not an end in itself. Eventually - and sooner rather than later - the two sides would have to start talking again about a future agreement. The 27 other EU countries have already agreed that if there is no deal then the first thing they would want to talk to the UK about after Brexit would not be a trade deal. It would be the financial settlement, citizens' rights and the Irish border - exactly those issues that are dealt with in detail in the withdrawal agreement that has been rejected three times in the House of Commons. The Brexit Party is offering simple solutions. But the Brexit process is full of complex problems.

"Fiat Chrysler has made a ""transformative"" merger proposal for French carmaker Renault, the Italian firm said on Monday. The combined business would be 50% owned by Fiat shareholders and 50% by Renault stockholders. The carmaker said the merger would create a global automotive leader, with 8.7 million vehicle sales. Carmakers have faced pressure to consolidate amid major industry shifts, including towards electric vehicles. Shares in both companies rose strongly following the announcement. In a statement,external, Fiat Chrysler (FCA) said the planned merger would create a ""world leader in the rapidly changing automotive industry with a strong position in transforming technologies, including electrification and autonomous driving"". Fiat said that if the firms' 2018 financial results were totted up, the combined company's annual revenues would be nearly â¬170bn (Â£149.6bn; $190.5bn), with operating profit of more than â¬10bn and net profit of more than â¬8bn. No plant closures would be caused as a result of the tie-up, the carmaker said. It will aim to save â¬5bn a year by sharing development costs on technology such as electric vehicles and self-driving cars. It is thought some managerial positions may be lost, but the companies will be keen to show that production-line jobs are being preserved. The new company will be based in the Netherlands and will be listed on the Milan, Paris and New York stock exchanges. To make the merger one of equals, the slightly-wealthier FCA will pay a special dividend of â¬2.5bn and sell its Comau robotics business. The proposal will be considered by the Renault board. Who will lead the new entity and what it might be called are not yet decided. If the plan goes ahead, Nissan and the French government will own about 7.5% apiece of the new, merged company. The French government favours the merger but wants more details before giving its final approval, a spokeswoman said. The Italian government may want to acquire a share of the new firm to balance France's stake, said a politician from the Northern League, the country's largest party, according to Reuters. By sales, the new company will be number four in North America, number two in the region which covers Europe, the Middle East and Africa and the biggest in Latin America. Carlos Ghosn is awaiting trial following his fourth arrest Industry shifts toward electric models, along with stricter emissions standards and the development of new technologies for autonomous vehicles, have put increasing pressure on carmakers to consolidate. Renault already has an alliance with Japan's Nissan, in which research costs and parts are shared. The companies own shares in each other, too. Renault owns 43.4% of Nissan's shares and Nissan owns 15% of Renault. The former chief executive of both Nissan and Renault, Carlos Ghosn, is awaiting trial following his fourth arrest amid allegations of financial misconduct. The allegations have put a strain on the 20-year-old alliance, which also includes Japan's Mitsubishi Motors. New entrants in the motoring sector such as Tesla, as well as cash-rich companies developing driverless technology such as Amazon and Google-owned Waymo, are putting pressure on older and often heavily indebted carmakers to keep up.

"Motor theft insurance claim payouts hit their highest level in seven years at the start of the year, according to the insurance industry trade body. The Association of British Insurers said claims for January to March were higher than for any quarter since 2012. It said a rise in keyless car crime was partly to blame, but did not have figures on what proportion of claims were for keyless vehicles. Researchers have previously said some new car models are vulnerable. Keyless car entry systems let drivers open and start their cars without taking their key out of their pocket. Recent testing byThatcham Research - which reviews cars' security systems- said six of the 11 vehicles launched this year had a poor security rating, including the Ford Mondeo, Hyundai Nexo, Kia ProCeed, Lexus UX, Porsche Macan and the Toyota Corolla Hybrid. Home Office figures show that car theft has risen by 50% over the past five years. Park your car in a well-lit area Keep car keys well away from external doors or windows Turn off the signal overnight or keep the keys in a signal-block pouch. The cost of claims has also risen, with the ABI saying that in total insurers paid out Â£108m in the first three months of this year - up by over a fifth on the same period last year. It said this was partly due to the higher costs of repairing technically advanced car designs. Despite the rise in insurance payouts, the ABI said the average price for motor insurance was at its lowest level for two years at Â£466. It said this reflected reforms to whiplash insurance payouts aimed at stamping out bogus claims. The legislation only comes into force next April, but the ABI said insurers had already started to reduce premiums in anticipation of lower payouts. Thieves, normally working in pairs, will target a car parked outside a house. One criminal will hold a device close to the car that boosts the signal meant for the key, while the other thief will stand close to the house with another device that relays that signal to the key, fooling the system. Once the cars have been stolen, they will be stripped for parts, police say. Why insure your car when it is parked?

"This video can not be played There was EU election joy for Alliance's Naomi Long Three women have been elected to represent Northern Ireland in the European Parliament. The pro-Remain Alliance Party won a seat for the first time after hugely increasing its vote in the NI poll. Its leader Naomi Long collected 170,370 votes - 115,000 more than her party received in the 2014 European election. Diane Dodds of the pro-Brexit Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Martina Anderson of pro-EU Sinn FÃ©in both retained their seats. Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar hailed Mrs Long's victory as a historic, pro-European vote which would be ""heard across the continent"". Her vote share was the best national showing for the cross-community Alliance Party, which isnot aligned to Northern Ireland's traditional Catholic or Protestant voting blocs. This video can not be played Watch the victory speeches of the new MEPs It comes afterAlliance's strong performance in Northern Ireland's council electionsearlier in May. Alliance's sister party, the Liberal Democrats,also made huge gains across the UK in the European elections. Speaking about the significance of her win, Mrs Long said her party rejected ""unionist and nationalist boxes"". How NI's European election count unfolded Full European election results How do European elections work? Why UK couldn't avoid European election The DUP's Diane Dodds was the first to be elected, retaining the seat she has held since 2009 Her voice cracked with emotion as she thanked those who had elected her, saying they had sent a clear message that they wanted to remain in the EU. ""The people who voted for me came together from right across the community, regardless of unionism, regardless of nationalism, regardless of all those labels,"" she said. This video can not be played Northern Ireland EU election count... in 70 seconds. ""I will serve them to the absolute best of my ability - they have my word on that."" All three European seats for Northern Ireland have been taken by women for the first time ever, with counting wrapping up earlier than expected in Magherafelt. The DUP's Diane Dodds was the first elected, but it was Alliance leader Naomi Long who exceeded expectations. She took the second seat, and polled more than 170,000 votes, taking transfers from right across the spectrum. The Ulster Unionists have some reflecting to do - they failed to retain the seat they've held for four decades, with Danny Kennedy only coming sixth. Now the question is for how long the three successful candidates will be MEPs. Eleven candidates were competingto become one of Northern Ireland's three members of the European Parliament (MEPs) in Brussels and Strasbourg. The threshold to win election was 143,112 votes. Mrs Dodds, who secured her place after the third count, won a total of 155,422 votes, while Mrs Long and Ms Anderson were voted in on the fifth count. Speaking after her election, Mrs Dodds said: ""The Democratic Unionist Party is by far the strongest voice of unionism, that voice that unionists trust to defend the union, to deliver Brexit. ""I think there's a lot of anger and frustration among those people who voted in the 2016 referendum that their voice has not been heard and the political class has not been heard. So we need to get on and deliver Brexit, one that is good for Northern Ireland."" Ms Anderson won a total of 152,436 votes - 9,324 more than the quota required to be elected. The Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) lost the European Parliament seat it had held since 1979 after its support plummeted by more than 30,000 votes on the total it received in 2014. UUP leader Robin Swann (left) admitted disappointment after Danny Kennedy was eliminated It limped in sixth in the first round, behind the leader of the Traditional Unionist Voice party Jim Allister, who accumulated a total of 90,079 votes over the five counts. Its candidate Danny Kennedy was eliminated after the second stage of counting, with party leader Robin Swann admitting it was a ""disappointing"" day. Martina Anderson - pictured with Sinn FÃ©in vice-president Michelle O'Neill - received the most first-preference votes After the elimination of Mr Kennedy - the sixth candidate to be excluded - the pro-Brexit DUP's Mrs Dodds passed the quota of 143,112 votes for election. Ms Anderson lost almost 33,000 first preference votes for Sinn FÃ©in - she polled just under 160,000 in 2014 - but said she was happy with her result, putting her drop down to tactical voting by her supporters. ""Primarily, the strategy has about getting two Remainers over the line,"" said the anti-Brexit politician. The SDLP leader Colum Eastwood was eliminated after the fourth stage of counting ""I've had republicans coming up to me and telling me: 'Look, you're safe and therefore we're going to vote tactically."" She added: ""We wanted to send a message back to the EU by, in the first instance, topping the poll and, more importantly, sending two Remainers back. ""Fifty seven per cent of the people who voted here voted to remain in the EU and they have sent a strong message back to Europe that they want to stay in the EU."" SDLP leader Colum Eastwood was eliminated after the fourth stage of counting. Voters across the UK went to the polls on Thursday to decide who would represent them in the European Parliament. Turnout was 45% of the 1,278,951 people eligible to take part, down on the 2014 election in which almost 52% eligible voters participated. A total of 1,463 ballot boxes were used across Northern Ireland and transported to the election centre in Magherafelt, County Londonderry, where counting began on Monday morning. Voter turnout dropped by more than 6% on the 51.84% who went to the polls in 2014 While the counting in the rest of the UK began on Sunday night, counting does not take place on Sundays in Northern Ireland - a long-standing arrangement due to the traditional observance by the region's Christian population of Sunday as a day of rest. Mrs Dodds of the DUP, Sinn FÃ©in's Ms Anderson and Ulster Unionist Jim Nicholson were elected in the 2014 European Parliament poll. Ms Anderson received the highest number of first-preference votes in that election - a total of 159,813 - while Mrs Dodds received 131,163. Ms Anderson said she was happy with her result Mrs Dodds and Ms Anderson both stood to retain their seats in Thursday's poll but Mr Nicholson did not. Instead Mr Kennedy, a former Stormont minister, was the candidate for the UUP. Northern Ireland uses a different voting system to the rest of the UK in the European election. In the single transferable vote (STV) system, voters are able to rank the candidates in order of preference. To make the system work, officials first need to calculate a quota. TUV leader Jim Allister, who came in fifth place, marks down results during the declaration They take the total number of valid votes cast, divide it by the number of seats available plus one and then add one. In the first round, if any candidate secures more first-preference votes than the quota they are elected. Surplus votes - those received above the quota - are redistributed among the other candidates.

"This video can not be played Tom Watson: Labour should 'urgently' consult members on Brexit Labour deputy leader Tom Watson has said his party lost ""many hundreds of thousands"" of potential votes in the EU elections because of its Brexit stance. He argued that confusion over holding a referendum on any deal had led to ""electoral catastrophe"", after Labour's share of the vote fell to 14%. But he welcomed leader Jeremy Corbyn saying the party was ""ready to support a public vote on any deal"". Several senior figures criticised Labour's position for lacking clarity. Mr Corbyn has attempted to appeal to both Remain and Leave voters in framing Brexit policy, but has come under increasing pressure from senior figures in the party to back a further referendum. Brexit Party dominates as Tories and Labour suffer UK results at-a-glance In the European Parliament elections, the Brexit Party, which supports a no-deal Brexit, won the most UK votes. Meanwhile, parties supporting a further referendum, including the Liberal Democrats and the Greens, picked up support. Backing for Labour and the Conservatives, whose members tend to have a broader range of views on the subject, slumped. As the results came in, shadow chancellor John McDonnell, one of Mr Corbyn's closest political allies, told the BBC another referendum may be the only way to break the Brexit deadlock in Parliament. This video can not be played McDonnell: Brexit 'needs to go back to the people' Faced with the prospect of a ""Brexiteer extremist"" running the Conservative Party after the contest to replace Theresa May as leader, Mr McDonnell said Labour must back a fresh public vote to prevent a ""catastrophic"" no-deal scenario. ""Of course we want a general election, but realistically, after [the European election results] last night there aren't many Tory MPs who're going to vote for a general election,"" he said. ""It would be like turkeys voting for Christmas, so our best way of doing that is going back to the people in a referendum."" This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn spells out his party's ""very clear policy"" The House of Commons has rejected Prime Minister Theresa May's withdrawal agreement with the EU three times, and cross-party talks between Labour and the Conservatives, aimed at ending the impasse, ended recently without agreement. Mr Corbyn said Labour's policy had been ""very clear"" all along. He also sent a letter to his MPs, saying it was ""clear that the deadlock in Parliament can now only be broken by the issue going back to the people through a general election or a public vote. We are ready to support a public vote on any deal."" Mr Watson, who has called for ""a confirmatory ballot"" on any agreement, said he was ""really pleased"" that Mr Corbyn had now ""signalled"" a change in policy. However, there was ""very little time"" before the 31 October deadline for Brexit, Mr Watson said, arguing that Labour must ""urgently"" consult its members either through a special conference or a ballot of members to change its Brexit policy. He said Labour's Brexit policy had been agreed by ""a very small number of people"" on Labour's ruling National Executive Committee, which had caused an ""electoral catastrophe"". This video can not be played ""I voted Liberal Democrat,"" says Alastair Campbell Labour's 14% vote share in the European elections is worse than its previous low in 2009. Across Britain, it was in third place, behind the Liberal Democrats and the Brexit Party. Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard,externalandWelsh Labour leader and First Minister Mark Drakefordhave also spoken out in support of another referendum following the EU election results. Former Labour communications director Alastair Campbell told the BBC he had voted for the Liberal Democrats ""for the first time in my life"". ""I felt on this issue the Labour Party has let its own supporters down, its members down and the country down in the way that it has failed properly to develop a policy that the party and country could unite around."" Labour's MPs are divided on Brexit. David Lammy, who represents Tottenham, in north London, called for the party to ""get its act together"" and come out fully in support of another referendum. But other Labour MPs in Leave-voting areas - like Don Valley MP Caroline Flint - said it would be a ""mistake"" for the party to appeal only to Remain voters.

"Home Secretary Sajid Javid has become the latest MP to join the race for the Conservative Party leadership. Announcing his candidacy on Twitter, Mr Javid said that ""first and foremost, we must deliver Brexit"". He is the ninth member of the Tory Party to confirm he is running, and whoever wins will become the next UK prime minister. It follows the announcement by Theresa May on Friday that she would stand down as leader on 7 June. She confirmed she would stay on as PM until a new leader is chosen - which senior Conservative figures said should be by the end of July. Tory leadership contenders - who's standing? The people who will choose the UK's next prime minister In a video, Mr Javid said he wanted to ""rebuild trust, to find unity and create new opportunities for our country"". He said the results of the European elections - which saw his party score less than 10% of the total vote, compared to nearly 25% in 2014 - made it ""all too clear"" that the government ""must get on and deliver Brexit to ensure there is renewed trust in our democracy"". He added: ""We must bridge divides to heal communities, reminding us of our shared values as a United Kingdom, and we must strengthen our society and economy so that everyone can benefit from the opportunities which a prosperous nation provides.""

The other candidates who have entered the contest so far are: Environment Secretary Michael Gove Health Secretary Matt Hancock Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt Former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson Former Leader of the House Andrea Leadsom Former Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey Former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab International Development Secretary Rory Stewart A number of the candidates expressed their dismay at the election results, which was dominated by the Brexit Party and left the Tories with just four MEPs returning to the European Parliament. Mr Johnsonwrote in the Daily Telegraph,externalthat voters had issued a ""crushing rebuke"" to the Conservatives, and the party could be ""fired from running the country"" if it does not deliver Brexit. Mr Gove said ""one message is clear"" from the figures and that was the next Tory leader ""absolutely needs to deliver Brexit"". And Mrs Leadsom called the results ""truly terrible"", saying they ""demonstrate the damage that has been done to the Conservative Party"". Attitudes toward a no-deal Brexit are sharply divided, with several candidates saying they are prepared to let the UK leave the EU on the new deadline on 31 October without a deal if necessary, including Mr Johnson and Mr Raab. Other candidates have stressed the need to get a Brexit deal passed in Parliament. Writing in the Times, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said Conservatives had to deliver Brexit through Parliament, ""whether we like it or not"". Nominations for the leadership will close in the week commencing 10 June, and MPs will then whittle down the candidates to a final two, which the wider membership of the party can then vote for.

"This video can not be played The winners and losers of European election night The Brexit Party was the clear winner in the UK's European elections, while the pro-EU Lib Dems came second. The Conservatives and Labour suffered heavy losses, with the former getting less than 10% of the vote. Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage said he was ready to ""take on"" the main parties in a general election. Mr Farage's party won 29 seats, the Lib Dems 16, Labour 10, the Greens seven, the Tories four, the SNP three, and Plaid Cymru and the DUP one each. The elections came after Prime Minister Theresa May tried three times to secure MPs' backing for her Brexit plan andannounced her resignationafter her fourth attempt prompted a backlash. LIVE: UK European election 2019 results UK results at-a-glance The UK picture in maps and charts What the EU elections tell us about support for Brexit Mr Farage told the BBC: ""With a big, simple message - which is we've been badly let down by two parties who have broken their promises - we have topped the poll in a fairly dramatic style. ""The two-party system now serves nothing but itself. I think they are an obstruction to the modernising of politics... and we are going to take them on."" The UK elected 73 MEPs Turnout was just below 37% - the second highest in any European election in the UK The Brexit Party received the highest share of the vote in nine of the 12 regions - with 32% overall The Conservative Party was in fifth place The Lib Dems took second place with 20% of the vote Labour Party fell to third place overall, with less than 15% of the vote The Green Party also made gains, seeing its best performance since 1989 Newly-formed Change UK did not win any seats, while UKIP haemorrhaged support to The Brexit Party Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said he was ""pleasantly surprised"" by his party's ""very good result"". He added that there was ""a majority of people in the country who don't want to leave the European Union now"". Polling expert Sir John Curtice said the results showed how polarised the country had become over Brexit. Were these results an overwhelming cry for us to leave the EU whatever the cost? Or a sign, with some slightly convoluted arithmetic, that the country now wants another referendum to stop Brexit all together? Guess what, the situation is not quite so black and white, whatever you will hear in the coming hours about the meaning of these numbers. The Brexit Party's success was significant and Nigel Farage's new group is the biggest single winner. But the Lib Dems, Greens, Plaid and SNP - all parties advocating the opposite - were victors too.

Across Europe, the big centre-right and centre-left blocs lost ground,amid a surge in support for liberals, Greens and nationalists. The UK had been due to leave the EU on 29 March, but after that deadline was put back to 31 October, participation in the election became mandatory. The Brexit Party topped the polls in every region of England apart from London.It also dominated in Wales,with Plaid Cymru second. It has now become the joint largest national party in the European Parliament, alongside Germany's CDU/CSU party.

The Brexit Party came in second place with a significantly lower percentage - 14.8% - followed by the Lib Dems with 13.9% and the Tories with 11.6% - meaning each party has one seat. What we know so far about the results EU-wide Is Europe seeing a nationalist surge? Who were the winners and losers? But Labour only received 9.3% of the vote - a loss in vote share of 16.6% - leaving it with no MEPs in Scotland for the first time. In Northern Ireland, the DUP (which supports leaving the EU), Sinn Fein (Remain), and the Alliance Party (Remain)all won a seat each. Brexiteer and Conservative MEP for the South East Daniel Hannan - one of only three Tory MEPs elected - said it was his party's ""worst ever result"". ""We voted to leave (the EU) and we haven't left - it's that simple,"" he told the BBC. Tory leadership hopeful and former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said the public had delivered ""a crushing rebuke"" to both major parties for failing to deliver Brexit. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is facing increasing pressure from senior members of his party to back another referendum on Brexit, with shadow chancellor John McDonnell saying it is the only way through the deadlock. ""If there can be a deal, great, but it needs to go back to the people,"" Mr McDonnell said. ""If it's a no-deal, we've got to block it and the one way of doing that is going back to the people and arguing the case against it because it could be catastrophic for our economy."" This video can not be played McDonnell: Brexit 'needs to go back to the people' But the leader of the Unite Union, Len McCluskey, said Labour's attempt to ""unite the nation"" over Brexit was ""an honourable objective that must not be abandoned"". And Mr Corbyn wrote to his MPs that it was ""clear that the deadlock in Parliament can now only be broken by the issue going back to the people through a general election or a public vote. We areready to support a public vote on any deal."" Green Party co-leader Sian Berrysaid the case for a further referendum was stronger than ever, adding that it was ""the way to draw a line under the Brexit chaos"". Change UK, which also opposes Brexit, failed to win any seats in the election, butleader Heidi Allen told the BBCher party - newly formed from former Labour and Tory MPs - was ""down, but we are not out"". Meanwhile, UKIP, which Mr Farage used to lead, lost all its MEPs, and saw a fall in its vote share of more than 20 points. The party's former deputy leader, Mike Hookem - who lost his seat in Yorkshire and the Humber - blamed UKIP leader Gerard Batten for the result. He highlighted Mr Batten's association with former EDL leader Tommy Robinson - real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon - who also failed to win a seat in the North West Region, where he ran as an independent.

"Aston Villa will return to the top flight after a three-year absence Aston Villa won promotion to the Premier League and secured an estimated Â£170m windfall as they held off a late Derby County fightback to win the Championship play-off final at Wembley. Villa,beaten by Fulhamin last season's final, seemed to be cruising to victory when John McGinn added to Anwar El Ghazi's first-half strike to put them 2-0 up with 30 minutes to go. However, Rams boss Frank Lampard threw caution to the wind and his side set up a frantic finale when substitute Jack Marriott's effort from eight yards took a deflection off Martyn Waghorn on its way in. Despite seven minutes of injury time they could not force an equaliser and now face another season in the second tier, while Villa return to the Premier League for the first time since relegation in 2016. Promotion at Wembley caps off a remarkable three months for Villa who had looked out of the promotion race before a club-record 10-match winning run saw them finish fifth. Perhaps unsurprisinglygiven the value of the game,the first half was a cagey affair. Rams midfielder Mason Mount was the first player to register a shot on target when he fired straight at Villa keeper Jed Steer from 20 yards late in the half. Phil McNulty: Smith proves perfect fit for Villa,external Villa potential 'massive' after promotion - Smith Lampard expects to stay at Derby despite Wembley loss Relive Villa's play-off final victory at Wembley How did you rate the players? With the game drifting towards the break goalless, Dean Smith's side launched a quick attack that El Ghazi finished off by coming in on the blindside of the static Jayden Bogle and diverting it into the net with his back. They doubled their advantage when Rams goalkeeper Kelle Roos misjudged the flight of a deflected El Ghazi shot and McGinn beat him to it to head into an empty net. That sparked Derby into life and they grew into the game before the combination of forwards Marriott and Waghorn got them back in it. But it was not enough and they now face a 12th successive season in the Championship. Victory at the national stadium brings a successful end to what has been at times a tumultuous year for Villa. Days after defeat by Fulham in last season's Championship showpiece it was revealed the club had missed a deadline to pay HM Revenue & Customs Â£4m and it seemed likely that star player Jack Grealish would have to be sold. With administration a serious concern, Chinese owner Tony Xia eventually sold the club to billionaire businessmen Wes Edens and Nassef Sawiris in July. They decided to stick with boss Steve Bruce until October, but after an indifferent start to the season, sacked the 58-year-old after a 3-3 draw with Preston, which had seen an irate fan throw a cabbage at him. Dean Smith's decision to make Jack Grealish Villa captain in March paid dividends Bruce was replaced in the dugout by Brentford manager and Villa fan Smith, with former Chelsea and Villa defender John Terry as assistant, and results initially improved. However, following an injury to midfielder Grealish at the start of December the team went on a torrid run of form and by the end of February they were eight points off the play-offs, having played two games more than some teams around them. Grealish returned to the side and was made captain for the home game against Derby on 1 March. The 23-year-old scored the fourth goal in a 4-0 win over the Rams which sparked a run of 10 successive victories and Villa qualified for the play-offs with two games to spare. They squeezed past local rivals West Brom on penalties to set up a meeting with Derby, who they had beaten by an aggregate of 7-0 in their two league meetings this season. This game threatened to go the way of the past two games between the sides when the superb McGinn bundled in with Roos flapping. It proved to be a much closer finish but Villa managed to hang on to claim a promotion that boss Smith said felt ""surreal"". He said: ""Reality sets in now. Last time I was sat in a news conference after a Wembley final, I had lost 2-0 to Bristol City in the Johnstone's Paint Trophy final with Walsall (in 2015). ""It's no more that we deserve because the players have made history (with the winning run). ""The potential here is massive. It feels right we are a Premier League club because of the history and the fan base that we have."" Frank Lampard has just completed his first season as a manager Derby reached the play-offs in dramatic fashion, with two goals in the final 30 minutes of their final league game of the season against West Brom giving them the win they needed to guarantee sixth position. More drama was to follow in their semi-final against Leeds United, when the Rams became the first team in second-tier history to recover from losing the first leg at home to go on to reach the final, as they fought back to win an incredible match 4-2 at Elland Road. Their build-up to the Wembley showpiece was in danger of being disrupted as rumours grew about boss Lampard leaving to replace Maurizio Sarri as Chelsea manager. The former England international said before the game he would discuss his future with Rams owner Mel Morris after Monday regardless of the result, but suggested he expects to be at Pride Park next season. ""I haven't had any discussions with any other clubs,"" said Lampard. ""I'll be having talks with Mel on how we can compete next year. ""The talks are important in terms of where we go. I want to move forward."" He added that the Chelsea ""noise was irrelevant"" and that he had ""loved working here and I want to continue that and continue progressing with the club"". Derby, who also lost out in the 2014 Championship play-off final to QPR, failed to threaten the Villa defence until they had gone 2-0 down. They will surely be left to wonder 'what if?' after a spirited last 10 minutes nearly saw them grab a leveller to send the game to extra-time.

Thanks for joining us during today's coverage of the European election results. You can of course continue reading our articles and analysis onBBC Politics. Alternatively, there's further coverage and news as it happens on the BBC News Channel. What happened? So, with results declared up and down the country, the Brexit Party have started from their official launch six weeks ago, to winning 31% of the vote and 29 seats representing the UK in the European Parliament. The Lib Dems came second, gaining 15 seats to win 16 overall. They got 20% of the vote. Labour came third, securing 14% of the vote, and losing 10 of their 20 MEPs from the 2014 Parliament. The Greens came fourth, receiving 12% of the vote. They were awarded seven MEP seats, up from three last time around. The Conservatives came sixth, scoring just 9% of the vote, losing 15 MEPs, and ending up with four seats in the European Parliament. In Scotland, the big story remains the SNP's dominance over other parties - with them winning another MEP seat at this election. In Wales, Plaid Cymru held on to their sole seat. UKIP and Change UK failed to win any seats. Counting continues in Northern Ireland, where the DUP's Diane Dodds is the first to be elected to one of its three European seats. Sinn Fein and the Alliance Party look set to win the other two. Naomi Long, who looks set to secure one of Northern Ireland's three European Parliament seats, says she is overwhelmed by the result. Jeremy Corbyn has written to Labour MPs to say the party is ""ready to support a public vote on any deal"", according to a New Statesman political correspondent. He urged them to ""stay united"", although he acknowledged they were ""understandably concerned"" at the outcome of the EU elections. ""In Parliament our responsibility is to ensure that a Tory civil war does not push us into a no-deal Brexit,"" says the letter, posted on Twitter by Patrick Maguire. ""But it is also clear that the deadlock can now only be broken by the issue going back to the people through a general election or a public vote. We are ready to support a public vote on any deal.""  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Brexit Party's Nigel Farage says that MEPs are ""doing this because we believe in it"". He says that his party winning will put ""pressure on the Conservative Party leadership contest"". He adds that if the UK doesn't leave by 31 October, then the Conservatives and Labour will lose votes to his party at the next general election.

BBC News Channel Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable says the party's ""next big task"" is to work with others to prevent the UK from ""crashing out of the European Union by accident"". He says it is ""very clear"" that there is a ""clear majority in the country who want to stop Brexit"". ""We've had a brilliant result, we've got a lot now to build on,"" he adds. He says he was ""pleasantly surprised"" at the results overnight, although it was ""clear that we had momentum"". ""The only way now to resolve the issue is to go back to the public,"" he says. Sir Vince adds that ""Jeremy Corbyn's position is now very weak"" and Labour's results were ""almost humiliating"". He says he would be surprised if both Labour and the Conservatives ""survive intact"" during the next general election. Turning to the upcoming Liberal Democrat leadership race, he says he does not have a preference for who takes over. It's won the largest share of the vote and the most seats in the UK's European elections and it's very clear the Brexit Party wants to leave the EU as soon as possible. But with many of its policies unknown and no manifesto, it's not clear exactly what a Brexit Party Brexit would look like. The party's leader Nigel Farage says he wants a ""clean-break"" Brexit, abandoning Theresa May's withdrawal agreement, but he avoids using the term ""no-deal"" Brexit. He wants its newly elected MEPs to play a ""major role"" in the Brexit negotiations but, as the Brexit Party is not in government and has no MPs in the House of Commons, that is unlikely. While the party is offering simple solutions, the Brexit process is a lot more complex. Read more on this here. Tory leadership candidate Rory Stewart has been out and about in east London, following his party's hammering in the Euro elections. Mr Stewart tweeted a call for people to come along and talk to him about issues ""beyond Brexit"". He added later: ""Everyone I am meeting today is talking about how they want to get beyond Brexit - letâs get this done, unify the country and transform Britain."" Allow Twitter content?

time to hold another independence referendum. Ms Sturgeon has previously said there should be a second vote before the next Scottish elections in 2021. Speaking at an event in Dublin, she also said independence would strengthen ties between
the Irish Republic and Scotland. UK government ministers have said they will not allow another referendum, after a majority of voters rejected

"Fiat Chrysler has made a ""transformative"" merger proposal for French carmaker Renault, the Italian firm said on Monday. The combined business would be 50% owned by Fiat shareholders and 50% by Renault stockholders. The carmaker said the merger would create a global automotive leader, with 8.7 million vehicle sales. Carmakers have faced pressure to consolidate amid major industry shifts, including towards electric vehicles. Shares in both companies rose strongly following the announcement. In a statement,external, Fiat Chrysler (FCA) said the planned merger would create a ""world leader in the rapidly changing automotive industry with a strong position in transforming technologies, including electrification and autonomous driving"". Fiat said that if the firms' 2018 financial results were totted up, the combined company's annual revenues would be nearly â¬170bn (Â£149.6bn; $190.5bn), with operating profit of more than â¬10bn and net profit of more than â¬8bn. No plant closures would be caused as a result of the tie-up, the carmaker said. It will aim to save â¬5bn a year by sharing development costs on technology such as electric vehicles and self-driving cars. It is thought some managerial positions may be lost, but the companies will be keen to show that production-line jobs are being preserved. The new company will be based in the Netherlands and will be listed on the Milan, Paris and New York stock exchanges. To make the merger one of equals, the slightly-wealthier FCA will pay a special dividend of â¬2.5bn and sell its Comau robotics business. The proposal will be considered by the Renault board. Who will lead the new entity and what it might be called are not yet decided. If the plan goes ahead, Nissan and the French government will own about 7.5% apiece of the new, merged company. The French government favours the merger but wants more details before giving its final approval, a spokeswoman said. The Italian government may want to acquire a share of the new firm to balance France's stake, said a politician from the Northern League, the country's largest party, according to Reuters. By sales, the new company will be number four in North America, number two in the region which covers Europe, the Middle East and Africa and the biggest in Latin America. Carlos Ghosn is awaiting trial following his fourth arrest Industry shifts toward electric models, along with stricter emissions standards and the development of new technologies for autonomous vehicles, have put increasing pressure on carmakers to consolidate. Renault already has an alliance with Japan's Nissan, in which research costs and parts are shared. The companies own shares in each other, too. Renault owns 43.4% of Nissan's shares and Nissan owns 15% of Renault. The former chief executive of both Nissan and Renault, Carlos Ghosn, is awaiting trial following his fourth arrest amid allegations of financial misconduct. The allegations have put a strain on the 20-year-old alliance, which also includes Japan's Mitsubishi Motors. New entrants in the motoring sector such as Tesla, as well as cash-rich companies developing driverless technology such as Amazon and Google-owned Waymo, are putting pressure on older and often heavily indebted carmakers to keep up.

"This video can not be played US President Donald Trump spoke to reporters after a bilateral meeting with Japan PM Shinzo Abe. US President Donald Trump has become the first foreign leader to meet Japan's Emperor Naruhito. Mr Trump, who is currently on a four-day state visit to Japan, was greeted by the emperor and Empress Masako at the Imperial Palace in Tokyo. The US leader said ahead of the meeting that it was a ""great honour"". Emperor Naruhito ascended the throne earlier in May after his father Akihito stepped down - the first abdication by a Japanese emperor in centuries. ""It's over 200 years since something like this has happened,"" Mr Trump said of the abdication on Sunday. ""So it's a great honour to be representing the United States."" Mr Trump and First Lady Melania Trump were greeted by a Japanese honour guard and crowds waving US and Japanese flags as part of a formal welcoming ceremony on Monday. The US president is said to have given a slight bow to the emperor and empress before entering the palace, according to news wire Reuters. Mr Trump and Mrs Trump will return to the Imperial Palace later in the evening for a dinner banquet. Mr Trump met Emperor Naruhito at the Imperial Palace in Tokyo Mr Trump reviewed the honour guard during a welcome ceremony Mr Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe met on Monday at the Akasaka Palace - a state guest house - where they discussed trade and relations with North Korea. Ties with the US are of great strategic importance to Japan, and the countries are currently working on a bilateral trade agreement. Mr Trump had earlier met with the families of Japanese citizens who were abducted by North Korea decades ago, to train North Korean spies in Japanese language and customs. The decades-old issue is a painful chapter in relations between Pyongyang and Tokyo. Daughter found after North Korea abduction North Korea has admitted kidnapping 13 Japanese citizens in the 1970s and 80s, and returned five to Japan in 2002. It maintains the rest are dead - something Japan does not believe. Mr Abe said at a press conference following the meeting that the abduction issue remained the ""most important thing"" for his government, adding that the families were ""appreciative"" of Mr Trump's visit. ""Irrespective of my term in office I have to do everything I can for the resolution of this issue,"" he said.

"Jake Humphrey said people were moved by the Nine4Norah appeal and ""dipped their hands in the pockets"" as well as sharing his tweet Sports presenter Jake Humphrey said a viral tweet about a bereaved father's appeal has been ""the absolute highlight"" of his time on social media. Watford fan Ross Coniam is attempting nine challenges in 2019 in memory of daughter Norah, who lived for just a few hours. A chance sighting of the appeal at an FA Cup game led to a tweet by Humphrey and donations topping Â£41,000. ""People told me 'I saw that and had to donate',"" said the BT Sports presenter. Mr Coniam said it was a""minor miracle""Humphrey spotted his #NineForNorah hoodie in the Wembley crowd at the FA Cup semi-final, and looked up the phrase on Google. Thousands raised after TV star tweet ""I found myself nipping off to the bathroom in the middle of the game to have a little cry, because I saw the pictures of little Norah,"" said Humphrey. ""Since becoming a father I can no longer see these stories and not imagine what it would be like if that was me, so this needed to be shared."" Ross and Naomi Coniam's daughter Norah was born on 29 May, but died nine hours and 56 minutes later despite doctors' efforts to save her. She would have been one on Wednesday. Allow Twitter content?

The words of Jack Grealish to Sky Sports seem to sum up what has made the difference at Aston Villa. It's a togetherness, a brotherhood. People who care and want the best for the club. Not to mention a future king in the stands. One of the biggest clubs in the country, once a European Cup winner on a famous night in Rotterdam, now back in the elite. Derby County did the EFL proud too, showing passion, heart and a never-say-die attitude. They just could not find a way through that Villa collective despite a late rally. For Villa though, this is only the start of it, the Premier League will be a tough test for the players, but tonight is about celebration. ""We'll get steaming,"" joked John McGinn. They deserve it.

FT: Aston Villa 2-1 Derby You've lived and breathed the immediacy of Aston Villa's 2-1 win over Derby, why not take a more considered look at what has unfolded this afternoon at Wembley?

Derby County had a chance to take promotion to the Premier League this season, but it fell short at the final hurdle. Their manager Frank Lampard came in last summer and brought a freshness to the Rams, adding quality like Jack Marriott - who made an impression off the bench - and Chelsea loanees Fikayo Tomori and Mason Mount. Harry Wilson too a loanee, was another key part of an exciting young side. But next season could be an interesting test. Can Lampard pick this team up? Can they recruit those young stars again? Will Lampard even be at Pride Park next season? It will be a big summer for the Rams. It was almost the perfect first campaign. FT: Aston Villa 2-1 Derby It's tremendous, it feels great to do something for all these great people behind us. The sky is the limit with the fanbase and the squad. Aston Villa co-owner Nassef Sawiris tells Sky Sports #bbcefl Neil Hughes:Genuinely gutted about the result, but great to see the future king of England wearing a baseball cap passionately screaming ""come on ref"" anxiously counting down the final seconds - like every football fan has - was quite heartwarming. FT: Aston Villa 2-1 Derby It feels very good. To be honest, the lads are a terrific bunch. They take on different ideas, they deserve it.

"A quick guide to the key points of the 2019 European Parliament elections in the UK. The Brexit Party was the clear winner, but the Lib Dems and the Green Party also made significant gains. The Conservatives have come in fifth place, with less than 10% of the vote. Voting took place against a backdrop of paralysis at Westminster over Brexit, andBBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg saidthe two biggest parties - Conservatives and Labour - had been damaged by their various contortions on the issue. They were beaten by rivals - on both the Leave and Remain sides - who offered clarity while they have tried to find nuanced ways through, she added. Polling expert Sir John Curtice said the results demonstrated how polarised the country was on Brexit - and how evenly support is split between Remain and Leave.

The party's leader, Nigel Farage,is once again an MEP in the South East. Some of the party's other well-known names were also successful. Annunziata Rees-Mogg, sister of Conservative MP Jacob,was elected in the East Midlands, while former Conservative Ann Widdecombebecame an MEP for the South West.

However, the Lib Demstopped the poll in London, taking three out of the eight seats in the region. Wales has elected two MEPs from The Brexit Party, one from Plaid Cymru and one from Labour. The Brexit Party topped the poll in 19 out of the 22 council areas. BBC Wales political editor Felicity Evans said it had been an ""extraordinarily bad"" night for Welsh Labour - a party that has won every Wales-wide poll (except one) for a century. Brexit Party tops European poll in Wales The SNP comfortably topped the poll in the Euro elections in Scotland, amid a collapse in support for Scottish Labour. The SNP took 38% of the vote, increasing its number of seats from two to three. The Brexit Party were second with nearly 15% percent and one seat. The Liberal Democrats and Tories took one seat each. Labour came fifth and lost both the Euro seats they held. BBC Scotland political reporter Philip Sim said it has been a good night for the SNP and a ""decent night"" for The Brexit Party, which improved on UKIP's previous performance in Scotland. SNP increases its MEPs as Labour loses out Northern Ireland's count does not begin until Monday,with most results expected on Tuesday. The big centre-right and centre-left blocs in the European Parliament have lost their combined majority amid an increase in support for liberals, Greens and nationalists. Populists gained ground in some countries but fell short of the very significant gains some had predicted. In Germany, both major centrist parties - including Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats - suffered, while in France, President Emmanuel Macron's Renaissance alliance was defeated by the far-right National Rally of Marine Le Pen. Europe's biggest blocs lose grip on power European elections: What we know so far The Conservatives came third in the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead - part of Theresa May's constituency - with 13.4% Even in Hillingdon, where Boris Johnson has his seat, they were relegated to fourth place with 12.4% The Labour Party came second in the borough of Islington, in Jeremy Corbyn's constituency with 28.5% Former Conservative Ann Widdecombe was elected as a Brexit Party MEP Alastair Campbell, PM Tony Blair's former spin doctor and prominent member of the People's Vote campaign for another referendum, said for the first time in his life he had voted for the Lib Dems Change UK's well-known names - such as Rachel Johnson, the sister of Boris, and Gavin Esler, the former BBC News presenter - failed to get elected UKIP's leader Gerard Batten lost his seat Controversial UKIP candidate, Carl Benjamin - who refused to apologise for saying he ""wouldn't even rape"" Labour MP Jess Phillips - was not elected Former English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson, who ran as an independent candidate in the North West under his real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, also failed to win a seat The South East region has - confusingly - elected two MEPs with the same name: Alexandra Phillips. One Alexandra is a Brexit Party MEP, the other represents the Greens Anti-Brexit parties - those in favour of another referendum - collectively took about 40% of the vote, compared with 35% for the two parties in favour of leaving the EU without a deal. Turnout in the UK was just below 37%. This is on course to be the second highest in any European election. Places that voted most strongly to Remain in the referendum saw turnout increase more compared with the last election in 2014 than places which voted most heavily for Leave. In Europe, turnout was the highest for 20 years, at 51%.

"The SNP's Alyn Smith will return to the European Parliament as one of his party's three MEPs The SNP is on course to increase its number of MEPs from two to three in the European elections amid a collapse in support for Scottish Labour. With 31 of the 32 Scottish council areas having declared their results, the SNP has 37.9% of the votes - up from 29% in the last EU election. Nigel Farage's Brexit Party has the second most votes and will have one MEP, as will the Lib Dems and Tories. Labour is fifth with just 9.3% of the votes - down from 26% in 2014. It means Labour will lose both of its MEPs in Scotland, including David Martin who was the UK's longest serving elected EU politician. The Western Isles will not declare its result until later on Monday, but it is unlikely to affect the overall Scottish result which is expected to be declared around noon. Brexit Party dominates in EU elections Live coverage of the EU election results Full UK results The Brexit Party is currently on 14.7% of the votes in Scotland, with the Liberal Democrats on 13.9% and the Conservatives on 11.7%. It means Scotland's six new MEPs will be; the SNP's Alyn Smith, Christian Allard and Aileen McLeod Louis Stedman-Bryce of the Brexit Party Sheila Ritchie of the Liberal Democrats and Baroness Nosheena Mobarik of the Conservatives. The Brexit Party's Louis Stedman-Bryce will represent Scotland at the European Parliament SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, the country's first minister, tweeted that her party had won a ""historic"" victory in the election, and that Scotland had ""rejected Brexit again"". The party's previous best European election result was 32.6% in 1994. The SNP won the biggest share of the vote in 29 of the 31 council areas to have declared so far, with the Lib Dems first in both Orkney and Shetland. At the last EU poll five years ago, UKIP won 10.4% of the vote in Scotland and secured one European seat. Prior to the final declaration this time, its vote share stands at 1.8% with the new Brexit Party winning 14.7% and on course to sending one MEP to Brussels. Turnout across Scotland is currently 39.7%, up from 33.5% five years ago. The election was held on Thursday in the UK, but the results could not be announced until after 22:00 on Sunday because voting was being held in other EU countries. The SNP fought its election campaign on a strong anti-Brexit platform, with leader Ms Sturgeon urging voters to back her party to show ""Scotland's for Europe"". The Liberal Democrats, whose vote is up across the UK, and the Scottish Greens also campaigned against Brexit and have joined the SNP in calling for another referendum on EU membership. The SNP's Mr Smith, who tops the party's list for the election, said it was clear from the results that Scotland was a ""different country"" to the rest of the UK - where the Brexit Party is on course to win the most votes.

Scottish Labour candidate David Martin, who had been an MEP since 1984 but will now lose his seat, said his party's woes in the election were because ""we didn't have a clear position"" on Brexit. He added: ""Our message clearly should have been that Labour is a remain party."" Labour lost both of its MEPs, including long-serving David Martin But party leader Richard Leonard - a close ally of Jeremy Corbyn - insisted that Labour had been the only party fighting to unite the country against ""the divisions caused by the competing nationalisms of the UK and Scottish governments"". Meanwhile, Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said her party had retained a Scottish MEP on what was a ""tough night for the party UK-wide"" The SNP and Labour both won two seats in Scotland in 2014, with the Conservatives and UKIP winning one each. Analysis by BBC Scotland political reporter Philip Sim To take the easy questions first, it has been a good night for the SNP, who have gained a seat while cruising ahead of all of its rivals. There were council areas where the party was comfortably 30 percentage points clear of their nearest rivals. It was also a decent night for the Brexit Party, who improved on UKIP's previous performance in Scotland and look set to take a seat. See also the Lib Dems, who say they ""are finding votes from places we have never been before"". But for every winner in politics, there's a loser. Other than the SNP's dominance, the big story of the night was Labour's utter collapse, losing both of their seats. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The official line from Labour is that they're being punished by a ""polarised"" political climate. Others in the party are more direct - calling it an ""absolute catastrophe"" and ""unforgivable"". Does this tell us anything about future elections, or the fate of Brexit? That's a much harder question. Yes, unambiguously pro-EU parties did well - although of course they were always expected to, in a country that voted 62% for Remain in 2016. The SNP in particular are keen to proclaim that the results shows that ""Scotland's not for Brexit"". The strong performances from the Brexit Party and the Lib Dems also underline the importance of having a clear constitutional position in an election that was all about sending a message. But while turnout was up on previous European elections, it was still low by comparison with almost every other vote held in Scotland over the last 20 years. Less than half of the electorate registered a vote. These results might not be replicated in any future Westminster or Holyrood election. But they will certainly shape the context of the debate in the coming months, at a pivotal time in politics. Nigel Farage's Brexit Party is on course to win the most votes across the UK Voting took place across the UK against the backdrop of Brexit, with both the Conservatives and Labour suffering big losses across the UK and the former heading for less than 10% of the vote. The Brexit Party was the clear winner, with the pro-EU Lib Dems coming second. Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage said the two main parties ""could learn a big message"" from the results. How does voting work in European elections? A really simple guide to the European elections All 28 EU member states are electing MEPs, and countries have been voting since Thursday. Voters across the UK will choose a total of 73 MEPs in 12 multi-member regional constituencies, with Scotland classed as a single constituency that will elect six MEPs.

The SNP's Alyn Smith, Christian Allard and Aileen McLeod have been elected MEPs SNP leader and Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, was on an official trip to the Republic of Ireland when the final declaration was made. Speaking from Dublin, she said that the outcome had shown that the ""UK political system has failed - and it has failed Scotland utterly"". Ms Sturgeon added: ""Scotland said no to Brexit in 2016. This result makes clear, we meant it. ""The message from Scotland today is that we will not accept a Brexit process that silences our nation, that treats our parliament and government with contempt and that fails to represent the interests of people in Scotland."" She pledged: ""The SNP will continue working with other parties to stop Brexit and all the ensuing economic damage to Scotland."" The party's previous best European election result was 32.6% in 1994.

He added: ""Our message clearly should have been that Labour is a remain party."" This video can not be played Richard Leonard: ""I am more and more compelled to believe that there should be a vote on whatever deal is facing parliament."" Labour politicians, MPs Ian Murray and Martin Whitfield, said it was ""devastating"" that Mr Martin had lost his seat. In a strongly-worded joint statement, they suggested Labour may ""never recover"" after posting the worst results in the party's European elections history. The pair blamed UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, saying: ""It is official Labour Party policy to support a People's Vote as a way out of this catastrophic mess, yet Jeremy Corbyn snubbed our membership and refused to embrace it. As a result he personally handed victory to Nigel Farage. ""As the hard right rises and the Tories tear themselves apart, Jeremy is squandering the opportunity to deliver a radical reforming government that so many millions of people urgently need."" Scottish Labour leader leader Richard Leonard - a close ally of Mr Corbyn - insisted that Labour had been the only party fighting to unite the country against ""the divisions caused by the competing nationalisms of the UK and Scottish governments"". However, he told the BBC that he was ""more and more compelled"" to believe that there should be another vote on the UK's future in Europe. Asked what vote he thought should be held, Mr Leonard said: ""[It should be on] Whatever deal is facing parliament, whether that is a no deal Brexit, which would be catastrophic, or some variant of that."" The SNP topped the poll, returning three MEPs but Scotland also elected the Brexit Party's Louis Stedman-Bryce Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson attended the formal declaration of Scotland's EU election results Sheila Ritchie, the newly-elected Lib Dem MEP, celebrated with party colleagues and supporters Meanwhile, Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said her party had retained a Scottish MEP on what was a ""tough night for the party UK-wide"". She said: ""It was clear before the election the Conservatives were going to get a kicking across the UK for not delivering Brexit as promised. ""This election - to a parliament we were already supposed to have left - had a unique set of circumstances. ""That we held our seat in Scotland is primarily down to the hard work of our campaigning team and I thank each and every one of them."" She added that dividing the pro-Union vote only served to benefit the SNP. The Scottish Liberal Democrats recorded a 6.8% increase in their vote compared with five years ago and in the UK as a whole the party's vote share rose by 12.4% to 20%. Lib Dem leader in Scotland, Willie Rennie, urged Ms Sturgeon not to interpret the SNP's success in the election as support for independence. He said: ""She's tried to say that people who voted remain in Scotland in the referendum have somehow indicated support for independence and she's misjudged that, she shouldn't misjudge this one as well.

"Labor has elected Anthony Albanese to lead the party Australia's Labor opposition has chosen Anthony Albanese as its new leader after the party suffered an upset in the nation's general election. Previous leader Bill Shorten resigned on 18 May, immediately after conceding the election to incumbent Prime Minister Scott Morrison. Mr Albanese, a veteran politician, was elected unopposed as his successor. He vowed to rebuild Labor's vote, saying on Monday: ""I am up for a hard job. I am up for hard work."" ""I intend to do my best to work with the Australian people to ensure that we elect a Labor government next time."" Labor is reeling from the election which delivered Mr Morrison's conservative coalition a majority. The Liberal-Nationals had previously been in minority government. Australia coalition wins outright majority How Australia is changing - in 11 charts Last week, Mr Albanese described the election loss as ""devastating"", after months of opinion polls had indicated that Labor was expected to win. The 56-year-old MP, from Sydney, has held senior positions in past Labor governments. He previously lost the last ballot for the Labor leadership to Mr Shorten in 2013. Often known by the nickname ""Albo"", he is from Labor's left-wing faction Raised by a single parent in public housing in Sydney before studying economics at the University of Sydney Worked as a staffer for Labor politicians, before entering parliament in 1996 One of Labor's most experienced MPs, he was briefly deputy prime minister to Kevin Rudd in 2013 He has held other portfolios including communications, infrastructure and transport. Mr Albanese has promised a ""reset"" of Labor's policy agenda but said he would not be rushed. The party had campaigned on a comprehensive set of reforms, including climate and tax policy changes. However, that ultimately failed to appeal to voters, with Labor suffering a 1.08% swing away from it nationally. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map It suffered its deepest losses in Queensland, where the party's vote was reduced to six seats of a possible 30. Much of the post-election analysis has focused on Labor's reduced vote from its traditional working-class base. In his first speech as leader-elect on Monday, Mr Albanese said he intended to build relationships with ""those people who wanted to vote for us, who were open to vote for us, but who felt like they couldn't"". He emphasised his economic credentials, and said he was open to working with the government to achieve progress on climate change and indigenous issues. ""Some reforms require bipartisan support,"" he said. The party's former deputy Tanya Plibersek, shadow treasurer Chris Bowen, and rising frontbencher Jim Chalmers were also eyed as potential leaders, but all withdrew from the race last week. Ms Plibersek said she would not run for the role because of family reasons.

"France's far-right RN was jubilant: A narrow victory over Mr Macron's party If you're scratching your head right now, confused by conflicting interpretations of the European parliamentary election, fear not, just read on. Contrary to some stark political predictions ahead of the vote, the actual results seem nuanced. In France, for example, far-right candidate Marine Le Pen beat President Emmanuel Macron at the polls. A huge victory for her, right? And for the nationalist Eurosceptic cause, while Mr Macron clearly failed to persuade voters with his reform agenda for France and the EU. But the margin of difference was so small between the two politicians, you could argue the opposite: that Marine Le Pen failed to truly capitalise on the weakness of an unpopular president, allowing him to emerge post-election with feathers ruffled, but not plucked. If you forgive my unglamorous analogy. European election results LIVE Europe's biggest blocs lose grip on power European elections: What we know so far EU election results in maps and charts The European election results 2019 can be read in different ways. The nationalist right didn't sweep the board. Traditional governing parties were not all decimated, as some commentators had breathlessly predicted. But there were clear trends. The traditional centre-left and centre-right parties, which have dominated the EU as long as anyone can remember, appear to have lost their majority for the first time in the European Parliament. This reflects a tendency already apparent in national elections all over Europe: rejection of the status quo. Look at the beating meted out to France's centre-right and centre-left; to Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel and her Social Democrat coalition partners; plus the slap in the face delivered to the UK's Conservative and Labour parties. Europe's voters are looking elsewhere for answers. They're drawn to parties and political personalities they feel better represent their values and priorities. Some are attracted by the nationalist right, promising a crackdown on immigration and more power for national parliaments, rather than for Brussels. Italy's firebrand Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini is a successful example, as is Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. Other voters prefer a pro-European alternative, like the Green Party and liberal groups, which also performed well in these elections. Germany's Green Party doubled its share of the vote The new European Parliament will be broadly pro-EU but also fractured, making law-making and change difficult. Just when Europe's voters are screaming for change. Voter engagement is clear, looking at the higher-than-usual turnout figures. At a time driven by identity politics, people care. And they used these elections to send a strong message to their national governments. It's not certain that Angela Merkel's coalition will survive this latest humiliation, after months of losses in significant regional elections. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras is dissolving his government to hold snap elections, after a disastrous showing at the European level for his left-wing Syriza party. And Matteo Salvini, who dreams of being Italy's prime minister, will likely push for an early general election, after emerging triumphant from these elections. All of this could have an effect on Brexit too. Tied up with their own national political dramas, EU leaders are even less likely to be open to renegotiating the Brexit divorce deal, if asked to do so by the next UK prime minister. And how willing are they to implement the changes in EU priorities and focus that Europe's voters seem to clamour for? The political ""flavour"" of the next president of the European Commission (chosen by the European Parliament and EU leaders) will be a good indicator. EU leaders come to Brussels on Tuesday to discuss that post and a host of other influential EU jobs about to become vacant, like that of European Council President (the person who represents all EU member countries in Brussels, replacing Donald Tusk) and the presidency of the European Central Bank.

"Manchester City chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak (left) with manager Pep Guardiola Manchester City chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak says some of their rivals are jealous of the club's success. City became the first English side to win a domestic treble when they beat Watford 6-0 in the FA Cup final, yet the achievement has been accompanied by criticism of the amount it hascost to put Pep Guardiola's squad together.,external However, in his annual assessment of the campaign on City's internal media, Mubarak said he will not accept his club ""being used as a diversionary tactic on poor investment decisions"". Premier League champions City do not have a player in the top 10 most expensive signings. English rivals Manchester United have two -Â£89m Paul PogbaandRomelu Lukaku,bought for an initial Â£75m - and Liverpool one inÂ£75m Virgil van Dijk. City's record signing is Riyad Mahrez, who they bought from Leicester for Â£60m in July 2018, while their other biggest transfers include Aymeric Laporte for Â£57m, Kevin de Bruyne for Â£55m and Benjamin Mendy for Â£52m. ""With success, there is a certain level of jealousy, envy, whatever you call it. That's part of the game,"" said Mubarak. ""It's not easy for our competition, we know that. But the reality is, we didn't buy the most expensive player in the Premier League [Pogba], we didn't buy the most expensive goalkeeper [Kepa Arrizabalaga], we didn't buy the most expensive midfielder, we didn't buy the most expensive striker [Lukaku]. ""People make decisions, they've got to live by them. This is a well-run club."" Criticism of City has intensified since it was confirmed they had been referred to Uefa's financial body amid allegations offinancial fair play (FFP) rule breachessomething the club strenuously denies. Mubarak is particularly upset at comments from La Liga president Javier Tebas, who said recently that City, backed by the Abu Dhabi United Group, and Paris St-Germain, owned by Qatar Sports Investments, were the""playthings of a state"" who should be kicked out of the Champions League,externalover their methods and spending powers. ""I think there's something deeply wrong in bringing ethnicity into the conversation,"" Mubarak said of the comments. ""This is just ugly, the way he is combining teams because of ethnicity. I find that very disturbing, to be honest."" City feel Tebas' comments do not bear scrutiny when it is considered how much Spanish giants Real Madrid spent during their 'galactico' era, when they signed Portugal forward Luis Figo, France midfielder Zinedine Zidane, Brazil striker Ronaldo and England captain David Beckham in successive summers from 2000. ""He [Tebas] talks about how we distorted the market,"" Mubarak added. ""There is a hypocrisy in this statement that is ironic. These huge jumps in these transfers - Figo, Zidane - where did they happen? ""I have no time for innuendo. Mr Tebas should look back at the history of La Liga, a league dominated by two clubs, and how distortion has happened. Manchester City has not a single player in the top 10 transfers. ""I don't think this is just an attack on Manchester City, it's against this league. I hope people start seeing that. I know people don't want to defend Manchester City - but for God's sake start defending this league. ""There are four Premier League teams in the two European finals. We have the best league in the world, the most commercial league and the most successful clubs in terms of global presence. That bothers a lot of people in many places."" Manchester City's record signing is Riyad Mahrez, who they bought from Leicester for Â£60m On 14 May, City saidthey were ""concerned"" at anarticle published in the New York Times,externalclaiming Uefa investigators wanted the club banned from the Champions League, saying they feared people with vested interests were intent on ""damaging the club's reputation or commercial interests"".

"Wales MEPs are Nathan Gill (front, centre) James Wells (second right) Jill Evans (left) and Jackie Jones (right) Nigel Farage's Brexit Party gained two Welsh MEPs after a sweeping victory in the European elections in Wales, winning in 19 of the 22 council areas. Plaid Cymru kept its MEP, coming second, with third-placed Labour taking the fourth seat, ahead of the Lib Dems. The Tories lost their seat and dropped to fifth in the vote, just ahead of the Green Party, UKIP and Change UK. Welsh Labour leader and First MinisterMark Drakeford said the party would now back a Remain vote in a new referendum. Brexit Party MEP Nathan Gill said the election result was a ""very strong message from Wales - we want our Brexit and we want it now"". ó ¿It means Mr Gill, first elected in 2014 under the UKIP banner, retains his seat in Brussels as a Brexit Party MEP, alongside his new party colleague James Wells. Mr Gill said only his party was ""committed to respecting the vote of the people of Wales"" to leave the EU in the 2016 referendum. As it happened: European election 2019 Wales Who are Wales' newly-elected MEPs? How does voting work in European elections? All 28 EU member states have been electing MEPs to the European Parliament. The Brexit Party, launched by Nigel Farage six weeks ago, has won 28 out of the 64 declared UK seats, with a total of 73 up for grabs. ""It's going to be a pain in the backside for the EU I should imagine,"" Mr Gill said. ""We're not going there to make it work, are we? I mean, we told them, let Britain leave the EU with a decent trade deal and you won't have any problems with Nigel Farage ever coming back. ""They didn't do that, did they?"" Jill Evans stays as Plaid Cymru's MEP and Jackie Jones replaces Derek Vaughan and retains Labour's Welsh seat in the European Parliament. It is the first time Plaid has beaten the Labour Party in a Wales-wide election, and only the second time Labour has lost such a poll in a century. Brexit Party - 271,404 - 32.5% Plaid Cymru - 163,928 - 19.6% Labour - 127,833 - 15.3% Lib Dems - 113,885 - 13.6% Conservatives - 54,587 - 6.5% Green - 52,660 - 6.3% UKIP - 27,566 - 3.3% Change UK - 24,332 - 2.9% Plaid leader Adam Price said the result was ""incredible"" and it ""shows that the tectonic plates of Welsh politics are shifting"". ""Support for the Westminster establishment parties is crumbling and Plaid Cymru is preparing to form the next government of Wales in 2021,"" he added. Ms Evans said: ""Plaid's manifesto set out a vision for a thriving future for Wales at the heart of Europe. I'm looking forward to throwing all my energy into delivering it."" The turnout was 37.1%, up 5.6% on the previous EU election in 2014. What the EU elections tell us about support for Brexit What are the clear trends from EU elections? Mark Drakeford congratulated Jackie Jones on retaining the party's seat. He warned that the election of a new Conservative leader would increase the chances of a ""catastrophic no-deal exit from the EU"". ""Faced with the damage of a hard-line, Tory Brexit, Welsh Labour believes that the final decision must be made by the public in a referendum. ""And, for the avoidance of any doubt, a Welsh Labour government would campaign, in such a vote, for Wales to remain in the EU,"" he said. Ex-Welsh Government minister Alun Davies blamed the huge drop Labour in Labour support on both Mr Drakeford and the party's UK leader, Jeremy Corbyn. ""This is the reality we face. Poor leadership from London and no leadership from Wales,""he said on Twitter,external. Tweeting,externalahead of the results, former Welsh Labour First Minister Carwyn Jones said a key message of the night was the failure of pro-EU forces to present a united front. ""Remain parties will comfortably out-poll the Brexit Party in Wales tonight, but the Brexit Party will come first in the vote tallies,"" he said. ""This is why I said we should have put forward a united slate, just like the Brexit Party."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Price agreed, telling BBC Radio Wales' Breakfast with Claire Summers: ""I would like to explore the possibility of a fully-fledged electoral pact between Remain parties. ""If there is a snap general election, it will almost certainly be fought, particularly on this Brexit issue, and we should get our acts together."" Nathan Gill celebrates the Brexit Party's double victory in Wales Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Jane Dodds seized on her party's fourth place as evidence that its ""fightback is in full effect"". ""Voters are listening to us again, supporting us again and believing in us again,"" she said. ""These results show we're on course to return a strong and effective Welsh Liberal Democrat assembly group in 2021."" Cadan ap Tomos, chairman of the Welsh Liberal Democrats National Executive Committee, told BBC Radio Wales that he was feeling ""absolutely fantastic"" about the result. Reacting to coming in fifth place - down from third in the previous European election in 2014 - Conservative Welsh Assembly group leader Paul Davies called the results ""extremely disappointing for our hard-working candidates"".

The party ""must now reflect long and hard on them"", he added. Lead Tory candidate Dan Boucher emphasised the ""very challenging circumstances"" of the poll, which took place because the prime minister had failed to secure the UK's departure from the EU on 29 March, as she had promised. ""People were very frustrated that Brexit hasn't been delivered and I'm personally frustrated that Brexit hasn't been delivered as someone who campaigned for it,"" he said. ""It's a very strong signal to the government."" Brexiteer David Davies, MP for Monmouth, said the results were ""an unmitigated disaster for the Conservative Party"". He added that ministers should stop ""whinging"" about Brexiteers like Boris Johnson and ""take some responsibility for the shambles they have helped create by failing to deliver Brexit"". The Green Party took 6.3% of the Welsh vote and its leader in Wales, Anthony Slaughter, said the election was not just about Brexit. ""Public concern for climate change has never been greater,"" he said. ""The people demand action, and the Green Party is the only party that promises to do that based on a record of real delivery."" This is an extraordinarily bad night for Welsh Labour, a party that has topped every Wales wide poll (except one) for a century. It may be the victim of a UK-wide issue and the ambivalence of Jeremy Corbyn's position on another EU referendum. But the Welsh party has defied the UK trend many times before.  And for their new leader, Mark Drakeford, presiding over a result like this is damaging. Sources say the party in Wales had no control over the conduct of the campaign or party policy on Brexit. What we do know is that Mr Drakeford has, for months, resisted pressure from within his own Welsh party to come out more strongly for a further EU poll. It was loyal to the UK party position, but was it the right call?

"Labor has elected Anthony Albanese to lead the party Australia's Labor opposition has chosen Anthony Albanese as its new leader after the party suffered an upset in the nation's general election. Previous leader Bill Shorten resigned on 18 May, immediately after conceding the election to incumbent Prime Minister Scott Morrison. Mr Albanese, a veteran politician, was elected unopposed as his successor. He vowed to rebuild Labor's vote, saying on Monday: ""I am up for a hard job. I am up for hard work."" ""I intend to do my best to work with the Australian people to ensure that we elect a Labor government next time."" Labor is reeling from the election which delivered Mr Morrison's conservative coalition a majority. The Liberal-Nationals had previously been in minority government. Australia coalition wins outright majority How Australia is changing - in 11 charts Last week, Mr Albanese described the election loss as ""devastating"", after months of opinion polls had indicated that Labor was expected to win. The 56-year-old MP, from Sydney, has held senior positions in past Labor governments. He previously lost the last ballot for the Labor leadership to Mr Shorten in 2013. Often known by the nickname ""Albo"", he is from Labor's left-wing faction Raised by a single parent in public housing in Sydney before studying economics at the University of Sydney Worked as a staffer for Labor politicians, before entering parliament in 1996 One of Labor's most experienced MPs, he was briefly deputy prime minister to Kevin Rudd in 2013 He has held other portfolios including communications, infrastructure and transport. Mr Albanese has promised a ""reset"" of Labor's policy agenda but said he would not be rushed. The party had campaigned on a comprehensive set of reforms, including climate and tax policy changes. However, that ultimately failed to appeal to voters, with Labor suffering a 1.08% swing away from it nationally. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map It suffered its deepest losses in Queensland, where the party's vote was reduced to six seats of a possible 30. Much of the post-election analysis has focused on Labor's reduced vote from its traditional working-class base. In his first speech as leader-elect on Monday, Mr Albanese said he intended to build relationships with ""those people who wanted to vote for us, who were open to vote for us, but who felt like they couldn't"". He emphasised his economic credentials, and said he was open to working with the government to achieve progress on climate change and indigenous issues. ""Some reforms require bipartisan support,"" he said. The party's former deputy Tanya Plibersek, shadow treasurer Chris Bowen, and rising frontbencher Jim Chalmers were also eyed as potential leaders, but all withdrew from the race last week. Ms Plibersek said she would not run for the role because of family reasons.

"A quick guide to the key points of the 2019 European Parliament elections in the UK. The Brexit Party was the clear winner, but the Lib Dems and the Green Party also made significant gains. The Conservatives have come in fifth place, with less than 10% of the vote. Voting took place against a backdrop of paralysis at Westminster over Brexit, andBBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg saidthe two biggest parties - Conservatives and Labour - had been damaged by their various contortions on the issue. They were beaten by rivals - on both the Leave and Remain sides - who offered clarity while they have tried to find nuanced ways through, she added. Polling expert Sir John Curtice said the results demonstrated how polarised the country was on Brexit - and how evenly support is split between Remain and Leave. The UK's results in maps and charts Full UK results This video can not be played The winners and losers of European election night Nigel Farage's Brexit Party - launched just six weeks ago - received the highest share of the vote in nine of the 11 regions declared so far. Overall it has taken 32% of the vote The pro-EU Lib Dems have also made gains, taking second place with 20%. They did best in Gibraltar (77% of the vote), Richmond upon Thames (52%) and Kingston upon Thames (47%) The Green Party recorded its best performance since 1989, taking 36% of the vote in Brighton and Hove and 35% in Bristol The Conservative Party was widely rejected by the electorate, with its worst performance since 1832 The Labour Party fell to third place overall - fifth in Scotland - and is on course to end up with less than 15% of the vote, an even worse performance than in 2009 UKIP, the winning party in the 2014 election, failed to take any seats Newly-formed pro-European party Change UK also didn't win a seat The SNP dominated in Scotland, with 38% of the vote Plaid Cymru came second in Wales, beating Labour The Brexit Party was the biggest winner in England, with 26 MEPs elected. The party's leader, Nigel Farage,is once again an MEP in the South East. Some of the party's other well-known names were also successful. Annunziata Rees-Mogg, sister of Conservative MP Jacob,was elected in the East Midlands, while former Conservative Ann Widdecombebecame an MEP for the South West. Annunziata Rees-Mogg, sister of Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg was elected in the East Midlands In the West Midlands,the party took a third of the vote, it tookthree of the six seatsin the Yorkshire and Humber region,two in the North East, anotherthree in the North Westandthree in the East. However, the Lib Demstopped the poll in London, taking three out of the eight seats in the region. Wales has elected two MEPs from The Brexit Party, one from Plaid Cymru and one from Labour. The Brexit Party topped the poll in 19 out of the 22 council areas. BBC Wales political editor Felicity Evans said it had been an ""extraordinarily bad"" night for Welsh Labour - a party that has won every Wales-wide poll (except one) for a century. Brexit Party tops European poll in Wales The SNP comfortably topped the poll in the Euro elections in Scotland, amid a collapse in support for Scottish Labour. The SNP took 38% of the vote, increasing its number of seats from two to three. The Brexit Party were second with nearly 15% percent and one seat. The Liberal Democrats and Tories took one seat each. Labour came fifth and lost both the Euro seats they held. BBC Scotland political reporter Philip Sim said it has been a good night for the SNP and a ""decent night"" for The Brexit Party, which improved on UKIP's previous performance in Scotland. SNP increases its MEPs as Labour loses out Northern Ireland's count does not begin until Monday,with most results expected on Tuesday. The big centre-right and centre-left blocs in the European Parliament have lost their combined majority amid an increase in support for liberals, Greens and nationalists. Populists gained ground in some countries but fell short of the very significant gains some had predicted. In Germany, both major centrist parties - including Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats - suffered, while in France, President Emmanuel Macron's Renaissance alliance was defeated by the far-right National Rally of Marine Le Pen.

One Alexandra is a Brexit Party MEP, the other represents the Greens Anti-Brexit parties - those in favour of another referendum - collectively took about 40% of the vote, compared with 35% for the two parties in favour of leaving the EU without a deal. Turnout in the UK was just below 37%. This is on course to be the second highest in any European election. Places that voted most strongly to Remain in the referendum saw turnout increase more compared with the last election in 2014 than places which voted most heavily for Leave.

"Wales MEPs are Nathan Gill (front, centre) James Wells (second right) Jill Evans (left) and Jackie Jones (right) Nigel Farage's Brexit Party gained two Welsh MEPs after a sweeping victory in the European elections in Wales, winning in 19 of the 22 council areas. Plaid Cymru kept its MEP, coming second, with third-placed Labour taking the fourth seat, ahead of the Lib Dems. The Tories lost their seat and dropped to fifth in the vote, just ahead of the Green Party, UKIP and Change UK. Welsh Labour leader and First MinisterMark Drakeford said the party would now back a Remain vote in a new referendum. Brexit Party MEP Nathan Gill said the election result was a ""very strong message from Wales - we want our Brexit and we want it now"". ó ¿It means Mr Gill, first elected in 2014 under the UKIP banner, retains his seat in Brussels as a Brexit Party MEP, alongside his new party colleague James Wells. Mr Gill said only his party was ""committed to respecting the vote of the people of Wales"" to leave the EU in the 2016 referendum. As it happened: European election 2019 Wales Who are Wales' newly-elected MEPs? How does voting work in European elections? All 28 EU member states have been electing MEPs to the European Parliament. The Brexit Party, launched by Nigel Farage six weeks ago, has won 28 out of the 64 declared UK seats, with a total of 73 up for grabs. ""It's going to be a pain in the backside for the EU I should imagine,"" Mr Gill said. ""We're not going there to make it work, are we? I mean, we told them, let Britain leave the EU with a decent trade deal and you won't have any problems with Nigel Farage ever coming back. ""They didn't do that, did they?"" Jill Evans stays as Plaid Cymru's MEP and Jackie Jones replaces Derek Vaughan and retains Labour's Welsh seat in the European Parliament. It is the first time Plaid has beaten the Labour Party in a Wales-wide election, and only the second time Labour has lost such a poll in a century. Brexit Party - 271,404 - 32.5% Plaid Cymru - 163,928 - 19.6% Labour - 127,833 - 15.3% Lib Dems - 113,885 - 13.6% Conservatives - 54,587 - 6.5% Green - 52,660 - 6.3% UKIP - 27,566 - 3.3% Change UK - 24,332 - 2.9% Plaid leader Adam Price said the result was ""incredible"" and it ""shows that the tectonic plates of Welsh politics are shifting"". ""Support for the Westminster establishment parties is crumbling and Plaid Cymru is preparing to form the next government of Wales in 2021,"" he added. Ms Evans said: ""Plaid's manifesto set out a vision for a thriving future for Wales at the heart of Europe. I'm looking forward to throwing all my energy into delivering it."" The turnout was 37.1%, up 5.6% on the previous EU election in 2014. What the EU elections tell us about support for Brexit What are the clear trends from EU elections? Mark Drakeford congratulated Jackie Jones on retaining the party's seat. He warned that the election of a new Conservative leader would increase the chances of a ""catastrophic no-deal exit from the EU"". ""Faced with the damage of a hard-line, Tory Brexit, Welsh Labour believes that the final decision must be made by the public in a referendum. ""And, for the avoidance of any doubt, a Welsh Labour government would campaign, in such a vote, for Wales to remain in the EU,"" he said. Ex-Welsh Government minister Alun Davies blamed the huge drop Labour in Labour support on both Mr Drakeford and the party's UK leader, Jeremy Corbyn. ""This is the reality we face. Poor leadership from London and no leadership from Wales,""he said on Twitter,external. Tweeting,externalahead of the results, former Welsh Labour First Minister Carwyn Jones said a key message of the night was the failure of pro-EU forces to present a united front. ""Remain parties will comfortably out-poll the Brexit Party in Wales tonight, but the Brexit Party will come first in the vote tallies,"" he said. ""This is why I said we should have put forward a united slate, just like the Brexit Party."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Price agreed, telling BBC Radio Wales' Breakfast with Claire Summers: ""I would like to explore the possibility of a fully-fledged electoral pact between Remain parties. ""If there is a snap general election, it will almost certainly be fought, particularly on this Brexit issue, and we should get our acts together."" Nathan Gill celebrates the Brexit Party's double victory in Wales Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Jane Dodds seized on her party's fourth place as evidence that its ""fightback is in full effect"". ""Voters are listening to us again, supporting us again and believing in us again,"" she said. ""These results show we're on course to return a strong and effective Welsh Liberal Democrat assembly group in 2021."" Cadan ap Tomos, chairman of the Welsh Liberal Democrats National Executive Committee, told BBC Radio Wales that he was feeling ""absolutely fantastic"" about the result. Reacting to coming in fifth place - down from third in the previous European election in 2014 - Conservative Welsh Assembly group leader Paul Davies called the results ""extremely disappointing for our hard-working candidates"".

The party ""must now reflect long and hard on them"", he added. Lead Tory candidate Dan Boucher emphasised the ""very challenging circumstances"" of the poll, which took place because the prime minister had failed to secure the UK's departure from the EU on 29 March, as she had promised. ""People were very frustrated that Brexit hasn't been delivered and I'm personally frustrated that Brexit hasn't been delivered as someone who campaigned for it,"" he said. ""It's a very strong signal to the government."" Brexiteer David Davies, MP for Monmouth, said the results were ""an unmitigated disaster for the Conservative Party"". He added that ministers should stop ""whinging"" about Brexiteers like Boris Johnson and ""take some responsibility for the shambles they have helped create by failing to deliver Brexit"". The Green Party took 6.3% of the Welsh vote and its leader in Wales, Anthony Slaughter, said the election was not just about Brexit. ""Public concern for climate change has never been greater,"" he said. ""The people demand action, and the Green Party is the only party that promises to do that based on a record of real delivery."" This is an extraordinarily bad night for Welsh Labour, a party that has topped every Wales wide poll (except one) for a century. It may be the victim of a UK-wide issue and the ambivalence of Jeremy Corbyn's position on another EU referendum. But the Welsh party has defied the UK trend many times before.  And for their new leader, Mark Drakeford, presiding over a result like this is damaging. Sources say the party in Wales had no control over the conduct of the campaign or party policy on Brexit. What we do know is that Mr Drakeford has, for months, resisted pressure from within his own Welsh party to come out more strongly for a further EU poll. It was loyal to the UK party position, but was it the right call?
