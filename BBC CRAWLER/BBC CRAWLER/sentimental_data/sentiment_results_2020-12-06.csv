"Roald Dahl's family has apologised for anti-Semitic comments made by the best-selling author, who died in 1990. A statement condemning Dahl's controversial comments, made in two interviews in 1983 and 1990, was published on his official website. In a discreet part of the website,external, his family and the Roald Dahl Story Company ""deeply apologise for the lasting and understandable hurt caused"". It said his ""prejudiced remarks stand.. in marked contrast to the man we knew"". The statement, which is undated, was spottedby the Sunday Times,external. ""The Dahl family and the Roald Dahl Story Company deeply apologise for the lasting and understandable hurt caused by some of Roald Dahl's statements. ""Those prejudiced remarks are incomprehensible to us and stand in marked contrast to the man we knew and to the values at the heart of Roald Dahl's stories, which have positively impacted young people for generations. ""We hope that, just as he did at his best, at his absolute worst, Roald Dahl can help remind us of the lasting impact of words."" A spokesperson for the Campaign Against Antisemitism said it was ""disappointing"" Roald Dahl's family ""waited 30 years to make an apology"". ""It is a shame that the estate has seen fit merely to apologise for Dahl's anti-Semitism rather than to use its substantial means to do anything about it,"" the spokesperson said. ""The apology should have come much sooner and been published less obscurely, but the fact that it has come at all - after so long - is an encouraging sign that Dahl's racism has been acknowledged even by those who profit from his creative works."" Anne Hathaway stars as the Grand High Witch in a new film version of Roald Dahl's The Witches Roald Dahl, who was born in Wales to Norwegian immigrant parents, remains one of the most popular children's authors in the world - with novels including Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Matilda and The BFG all adapted for the big screen. In an interview with the New Statesman in 1983, he said he believed that there was ""a trait in the Jewish character that does provoke animosity"". Seven years later, in a piece in the Independent, the author acknowledged he had ""become anti-Semitic"". The remarks, for which the writer refused to apologise, have continued to cause upset among the Jewish community. In 2018, the Royal Mint chose not to issue a commemorative coin on the 100th anniversary of his birth because of his anti-Semitic views. At the time, Wes Streeting, Labour MP, applauded the decision by the Royal Mint, citing the author's ""classic, undeniable, blatant anti-Semitism"". The dark side of Roald Dahl With the enduring popularity of his novels, Roald Dahl's estate continues to be highly lucrative, posting annual pre-tax profits of Â£12.7m in 2018 - largely thanks to film and television deals. In October this year,a new film version of The Witcheswas released starring Anne Hathaway, and in March Netflix announced a forthcoming adaptation of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. The Roald Dahl Story Company later added: ""Apologising for the words of a much-loved grandparent is a challenging thing to do, but made more difficult when the words are so hurtful to an entire community. ""We loved Roald, but we passionately disagree with his anti-Semitic comments. This is why we chose to apologise on our website.""

"The market is a popular annual tradition in the city A Christmas market which sparked concerns over the spread of coronavirus has closed - one day after it opened. Nottingham's Winter Wonderland opened on Saturday despiteobjections from residentsin the city, which is under tier three restrictions. Organiser Mellors Group initially announced a temporary closure due to ""unprecedented high footfall"". On Sunday, the city councilsaid it had made a joint decision with the organisers,externalnot to reopen this year. The market was set to run from 10:00 to 21:00 GMT every day until Christmas Eve. Crowds forced it to close at 18:00 on Saturday. Similar annual events in cities including Birmingham and Manchester were cancelled this year due to the pandemic. Concerns have been raised over the levels of social distancing observed at the Christmas market in Nottingham Jo Cox-Brown, from Night Time Economy Solutions, said she had been in the city centre to support Small Business Saturday and witnessed crowds where people were close together and not wearing masks. She said she worried the market could cause a spike in local coronavirus cases. ""It wasn't being well-managed it wasn't being very well-controlled,"" she said. ""People were defecating in doorways because there's no toilets open."" Ms Cox-Brown said many people who had been in touch were ""really angry"" the event went ahead and felt organisers were ""putting their Christmas at risk"". Simon Bonsai said he was ""hugely disappointed"" to see the market closed Trader Simon Bonsai said he was ""hugely disappointed"" by the closure after a brisk day of trading on Saturday, but said the decision was ""obvious"". ""It was so busy last night, there were too many people about,"" he said. In a joint statement, Mellors Group and the city council said it implemented a ""wide range of measures"" to ensure compliance with tier three restrictions. ""However, numbers were too large to implement these effectively,"" they said. ""We're sorry it has not worked out."" Mellors previously said there had been ""pent-up demand"" for city-centre shopping after the second nationwide lockdown, which ended on Wednesday.

"This video can not be played Fifty hospitals in England have been chosen as hubs for administering the vaccine The coronavirus vaccine is the ""beginning of the end"" of the epidemic in the UK, Prof Stephen Powis has said, as vaccinations begin on Tuesday. But the NHS England medical director warned the distribution of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine would be a ""marathon not a sprint"". It will take ""many months"" to vaccinate everybody who needs it, he said. Frontline health staff, those over 80, and care home workers will be first to get the Covid-19 vaccine. In England, 50 hospitals have been initially chosen to serve as hubs for administering the vaccine. Scotland,Wales, andNorthern Irelandwill also begin their vaccination programmes from hospitals on Tuesday. Prof Powis was speaking outside Croydon University Hospital in south London, which became one of the first hospitals in the UK to take delivery of the vaccine on Sunday. Vaccines were delivered to Croydon University Hospital on Sunday It comes as a further 231 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported in the latest UK government figures, and a further 17,272 cases. Health Secretary Matt Hancock described the start of the vaccination scheme as ""a historic moment"". ""I urge everybody to play their part to suppress this virus and follow the local restrictions to protect the NHS while they carry out this crucial work,"" he said. What are the safety checks for vaccines How will I get a vaccine? NHS staff: 'Vaccine is a game changer' Refrigerated containers holding the vaccine doseshave been arriving in the UK from Belgium, and are being prepared to be moved from secure locations to the hospitals. Prof Powis said despite ""huge complexities"", the first doses would arrive at hospitals on Monday, to be ready to administer from Tuesday. ""As a doctor this is a really exciting moment,"" he said. ""NHS staff around the country at vaccination hubs have been working tirelessly to make sure that we are prepared to commence vaccination on Tuesday."" He added: ""The NHS has a strong record of delivering large scale vaccination programmes - from the flu jab, HPV vaccine and lifesaving MMR jabs."" About 800,000 doses of the vaccine are expected to be available in the UK from next week. So far the government has ordered a total of 40 million doses - enough to vaccinate 20 million people, with two shots each, 21 days apart. With limited quantities initially available, elderly people who are already attending hospital as an outpatient, as well as those who are being discharged home after a hospital stay, will be among the first to receive the jab. Others over the age of 80 will be invited to attend the hospital to receive a jab, and care home providers will be able to book their staff into vaccination clinics. Any appointments not used for these groups will be used for healthcare workers who are at highest risk of serious illness from the virus. Dr June Raine, chief executive of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), said people could have ""real confidence"" in the vaccine, adding: ""The highest standards of scrutiny, of safety and of effectiveness and quality have been met, international standards."" She also said the MHRA would also be ""following up all the safety issues after rollout incredibly carefully. Our job doesn't end when rollout starts."" Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Dr Raine vowedthe vaccine will reach everyone in the UK who needs it - whatever the outcome of post-Brexit trade talks, saying officials were ""fully prepared"". This video can not be played How will the new Pfizer vaccine work? Because the Pfizer vaccine needs to stored and moved carefully each container is being inspected to ensure the vaccine vials have reached the UK in perfect condition. Tracking data covering every box's journey from Belgium is being downloaded to check that the vials have been kept well below freezing. The boxes each contain five packs of 975 doses, and will be split into smaller packs to be distributed around the country and defrosted. The vaccine is made in Belgium and has to be stored at around -70C Although care home residents and staff are top of the priority list agreed by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), they may not get the vaccine first ""for operational reasons"". Prof Anthony Harnden - deputy chair of the JCVI -told the BBC on Fridaysaid the committee would ""closely monitor"" delivery and stressed he still expected care home residents ""to be prioritised"". Mr Hancock said the government was doing everything it could to overcome ""significant challenges"" to ensure care home residents were vaccinated as soon as possible. Speaking to the Sunday Telegraph,external, the health secretary said fast-track approval of the Covid jab meant restrictions might be relaxed before the end of March next year. As well as the challenge of delivering the vaccine, health experts are also conscious that the public needs to be educated and persuaded to support the vaccination programme. A host of famous faces,externalincluding chat show host Sir Michael Parkinson and the singer Lulu, have told the Sunday Mirror that they will take the coronavirus vaccine without hesitation. It follows concerns thatonline misinformation about vaccines could turn some people against being vaccinated. The Mail on Sunday,externalreports that the Queen is expected to receive the vaccine ""within weeks"" before revealing she has had it to boost public take-up of the jab. The paper quotes senior sources who say the 94-year-old monarch and her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, 99, will not get ""preferential treatment"" and will ""wait in line"" during the first wave of jabs reserved for the over-80s and care home residents.

"The end of sledging and snowball fights in the UK? Snowy winters could become a thing of the past as climate change affects the UK, Met Office analysis suggests. It is one of a series of projections about how UK's climate could change, shared with BBC Panorama. It suggests by the 2040s most of southern England could no longer see sub-zero days. By the 2060s only high ground and northern Scotland are still likely to experience such cold days. The projections are based on global emissions accelerating. It could mean the end of sledging, snowmen and snowball fights, says Dr Lizzie Kendon, a senior Met Office scientist who worked on the climate projections. ""We're saying by the end of the century much of the lying snow will have disappeared entirely except over the highest ground,"" she told Panorama. If the world reduces emissions significantly the changes will be less dramatic, the Met Office says. What will climate change look like near me? The year 2020 set to be in top three warmest Covid pandemic has little impact on rise in CO2 Can sending fewer emails really save the planet? Warmer winters linked to increased drowning risk The average coldest day in the UK over the past three decades was -4.3 Celsius. If emissions continue to accelerate, leading to a global temperature rise of 4C, then the average coldest day in the UK would remain above 0 Celsius across most of the country throughout winter. Even if global emissions are reduced dramatically and world temperatures rise by 2C, the average coldest day in the UK is likely be 0 Celsius. The Met Office says these temperatures are subject to variation and some years may see days colder than the average. Its projections explore how the UK's climate might change. ""The overarching picture is warmer, wetter winters; hotter, drier summers,"" Dr Kendon says. ""But within that, we get this shift towards more extreme events, so more frequent and intense extremes, so heavier rainfall when it occurs."" The Met Office says we are already seeing dramatic changes in the UK climate. Picture postcard: Snow covered houses in Gold Hill in Shaftesbury, Dorset in 2019 ""The rate and nature of the climate change that we're seeing is unprecedented,"" says Dr Mark McCarthy of the Met Office's National Climate Information Centre. Most of the country has already seen average temperatures rise by 1C since the Industrial Revolution and we should expect more of the same, he warns. That may not sound like much, but even these small changes in our climate can have a huge impact on the weather and on many plants and animals. The Met Office says there could be significant temperature rises in the decades ahead for both winter and summer. It says the biggest increases will be in the already warmer southern parts of the UK. At the same time extreme weather is expected to become more frequent and more intense. Heatwaves are likely to become more common and last longer, with record temperatures being exceeded regularly. The average hottest day could reach a sweltering 40C the data suggests Not every summer will be hotter than the last, the Met Office says, but the long-term trend is steadily upwards, particularly if emissions remain unabated. That high-emissions scenario shows peak summer temperatures could rise by between 3.7 C and 6.8 C by the 2070s, compared with the period 1981 to 2000. If the world succeeds in reducing emissions, these temperature rises will be considerably smaller. The level of detail in the models mean it is possible to see how the climate might change in neighbourhoods across the country. This video can not be played The Wingfields' home in South Yorkshire has only just recovered after floods in 2019. Hayes in west London, for example, is likely to see some of the most dramatic temperature rises of all, the new data suggests. The average hottest day in Hayes was 32C around 20 years ago. If emissions continue to accelerate, the new Met Office data suggests the average hottest day could reach a sweltering 40C by around 2070. If global emissions reduce, this temperature rise will not be so severe. A really simple guide to climate change How much warmer is your city? Climate change: Where we are in seven charts What is 'net zero'? And other key terms explained ""I mean, I think it's really frightening. That's a big change, and we're talking about in the course of our lifetime. It's just a wake-up call really as to what we're talking about here,"" says Dr Kendon. Summers might not just be hotter, they could be drier too, the Met Office predicts. Summer rain could become less frequent, but when it does rain it is likely to be more intense. The combination of longer dry periods with sudden heavy downpours could increase the risk of flooding because dry ground doesn't absorb water as well as damp ground. Rainfall is expected to increase in many parts of the country in winter too, the Met Office says. The projections suggest western parts of the UK may get even wetter under a high-emissions scenario. Of course, some years will always buck the trend by being wetter or cooler than others - and there will be significant regional variations. This pattern of wetter winters and more intense summer downpours across much of the country risks putting infrastructure under greater strain. Roads, railways, reservoirs, sewers, bridges and other infrastructure is all designed for the sort of rainfall we have had in the past and much of it may need to be upgraded or even rebuilt to cope with the storms and floods to come. Last week, the UK government announced ambitious new targets for tackling climate change. The new goal is to cut the UK's greenhouse gas emission by 68% by the end of the decade, based on 1990 levels. Boris Johnson hopes the new targets will set an example to other nations, which will join a virtual climate pledges summit on 12 December. This virtual event will occur in place of annual UN climate talks, which were set to have taken place in Glasgow this year, but were postponed because of Covid-19.

"Shoppers embraced a pedestrianised Regent Street in central London on Saturday Shoppers flocked to High Streets and shopping malls across England this weekend, but in numbers well below pre-pandemic levels. It was the first weekend since stores in England reopened on Wednesday. Many business owners are pinning their hopes on a curtailed pre-Christmas trading period, having endured two national lockdowns already this year. But on average, shopper numbers were a quarter below 2019 levels, according to market research firm Springboard. It says across the UK as a whole, footfall was down by 30% compared to the same December weekend last year. It comes on the back of a dreadful week for the retail industry with Topshop-owner Arcadia falling into administration and Debenhams saying it would be closing its 124 stores by March after it failed to find a buyer. Shoppers out in force under new England tier rules Debenhams set to close putting 12,000 jobs at risk Topshop owner Arcadia goes into administration Central London remains far emptier than usual because of the coronavirus pandemic, despite some crowds flocking to specially pedestrianised shopping areas in Regent Street on Saturday. On Sunday, shopper numbers in the capital were half what they would normally be weeks out from Christmas, Springboard reported. Boutique-owner Rowena Howie says her central London store had far fewer shoppers than a normal December weekend Rowena Howie, who runs a womenswear boutique called Revival Retro in central London, said there were far fewer shoppers in her store than she would normally expect in the lead up to Christmas. ""We definitely wouldn't have been as busy in the shop as we might have been in a normal year, particularly in the first weekend of December,"" she said. Although Ms Howie - who took part in a campaign promoting small businesses on Saturday - said strong online sales meant she was able to record a good day's trading, the first since before Covid-19. ""We're in Fitzrovia, having a bricks and mortar store, our takings have been really impacted,"" she said. Anna Blackburn, managing director of jewellery chain Beaverbrooks, said footfall had increased by about 10% in its 70 High Street stores this weekend. ""There has been a trend of reducing footfall for sometime, but an increase in the average transaction size. People coming to the High Street are definitely spending more money,"" she told the BBC's Today programme. Ms Blackburn said there had also been a spike in wedding and engagement ring sales. ""It's been a tough year, people want to treat their loved ones."" Shoppers appear more eager to visit retail parks than malls and High Streets. On Saturday, footfall numbers for England's retail parks were slightly higher than they were this time last year, but on Sunday they fell back and were 10% below last year's figure. Shoppers queue up outside Primark in Coventry this weekend. We are still a nation of shoppers. Overall, retail sales are above pre-pandemic levels, according to the ONS. But that number masks a mixed picture of what we're buying and how we are buying it. Clothing sales for example are down by 25%. And there has been a dramatic shift to online, accelerating a growing trend. It's this dramatic change that has been so devastating for the High Street. Some of the pictures from this weekend might seem to show a bounce back. But the figures show that the numbers of people out and about are well down on last December. That comes on top of lengthy closures for non-essential shops. The Centre for Retail Research predicts more than 20,000 shops will close compared to 16,000 last year - and that job losses will rise to 235,000 people compared to 143,000 last year. The cost of running a shop is just too much for many. One independent retailer in central London told me she couldn't see herself still in bricks and mortar next year. Despite a 12-month break from business rates offered by the government, the rent, coupled with falling shopper numbers, is just too much to bear. In one encouraging sign for retailers and small business owners, shoppers seem far more comfortable returning to public shopping areas after the second national lockdown than they did after the first. Footfall across England was 60% higher this weekend than on 20-21 June, the first weekend shops were allowed to reopen after the country's first lockdown, which began in March. ""Part of this is timing - the proximity to Christmas means there is huge pent up demand amongst consumers to shop in store to purchase gifts,"" said Diane Wehrle, Springboard's marketing director. ""However, it is also an indicator of 'lockdown fatigue', whereby after many months of being restricted to their homes, consumers are keen to visit retail stores again, particularly to experience the excitement of Christmas. ""They have become accustomed to the 'new normal' that involves wearing face masks in stores and queuing in order to adhere to social distancing rules which we were not all comfortable with in June.""

"It was an unusual hijacking by a group of three men, two women and three young children. They commandeered a Delta airliner, flew across the Atlantic and the adults never set foot in the US again, four of them making France their permanent home. An airport vehicle driven by a man in swimming trunks approached the Delta Airlines DC-8 standing on the tarmac of Miami airport in the summer heat. The vehicle's passenger - also wearing swimming trunks - stepped out, carrying a heavy blue suitcase under his arm, and walked until he was under the open door of the airliner's fuselage. A rope dropped down, and the suitcase was hauled up. Inside was $1m. The men in trunks were FBI officers, whom the hijackers had insisted wear no clothes to ensure that they weren't armed - though one later claimed to be carrying a gun in his trunks anyway. Once the money had been checked, the 86 passengers on the flight from Detroit were released and the empty plane took off again, heading for North Africa via Boston. It was 31 July 1972, and this was the second time in little over a month that hijackers were trying to reach the Algerian headquarters of the Black Panther Party - at that point the most powerful black power movement in the US. Two of the hijackers were Melvin McNair, 24, and his 26-year-old wife Jean. When they had met at university in North Carolina seven years earlier, no-one could have predicted they would end up being charged with air piracy - an offence carrying a 20-year minimum sentence, and a maximum of death. McNair had grown up in Greensboro, North Carolina, where he excelled in baseball - his team became the state champions in the black league. White teams wouldn't play black ones, that was just the way it was, he says. He also played American football and his studies at North Carolina State College were supported by a sports scholarship - until he took part in riots following the assassination of Martin Luther King in 1968. McNair was instantly dropped from the football team, lost his scholarship, and his studies came to an end. But it was when he was drafted into the US Army the following year that he really discovered institutional racism, he says. Stationed in Berlin, he witnessed Ku Klux Klan-style cross burnings on US military compounds, and some of his fellow black soldiers got beaten up by white supremacists in the barracks. ""Racism was not hidden, so we started discussing militant action. We started to resist passively by refusing to salute officers, we wore black armbands, grew our hair long and didn't stand up for the national anthem,"" he says. ""At the same time the Black Panthers movement back in the US was looking to extend its reach internationally and came to Berlin to talk to us and recruit us - and that's when I joined the Panthers."" Jean had joined McNair in Berlin and when, in 1970, he was told he would soon be sent to fight in Vietnam, she was just about to give birth to their first child. Later that year they flew back to the US, supposedly to find somewhere for Jean and their son to live while Melvin was away. Instead McNair deserted, and the couple went underground in Detroit, which was at that time a hive of black militancy. In Detroit they ended up sharing a house with two other men on the run from the law. One, George Wright, had been convicted of murder after a botched robbery that left a petrol station owner dead, but McNair and Jean were unaware of this - it wasn't considered appropriate to ask questions about each other's past. When the other man, George Brown, was shot by Detroit police, fortunately sustaining only minor injuries, this intensified their determination to leave the US. The group's sights turned to Algeria, where the charismatic Black Panther leader, Eldridge Cleaver, had been welcomed after getting into trouble with the law in the US, and opened a branch of the party. But how were they to get there? The men came up with a plan. In the early 1970s hijackings were far more common than now. McNair says they did their research by spending time at Detroit airport and asking lots of questions. ""That period of time was crazy, everything was crazy, everything was full of madness but we studied hijacking and we looked at the weaknesses and the strengths of that kind of operation,"" McNair says. ""We had to pick a plane that could do the whole route and cross the Atlantic. That's why we chose the plane we did."" They adopted disguises. George Wright dressed as a priest, George Brown as a student, and McNair as a businessman. Travelling with them were Jean and George Brown's girlfriend, Joyce Tillerson. By this stage Jean and McNair had two children, while Brown and Tillerson had one. Jean McNair, with one of the couple's children Somehow they smuggled three small handguns on board. One story goes that they were hidden inside hollowed-out Bibles, and that when the metal detectors went off, security guards assumed it was because the women were wearing jewellery. McNair's caginess about the details, even now, suggests that there was more to it and that maybe they had help from an airport employee. Once Delta Air Lines flight 841 from Detroit to Miami was airborne the hijackers let the passengers eat their meal before springing into action. But even after making their demand for $1m and a flight to Algiers they tried not to frighten anyone. ""We didn't want to create a sense of panic, remember we had three children travelling with us too,"" McNair says. ""We even tried to make the mood lighter by playing a cassette of soul music including Stevie Wonder, The Temptations and the Four Tops."" Once they landed in Miami negotiations with the FBI began. At first the police said they could only come up with half a million dollars, so the hijackers said they would keep half of their hostages and take off. George Wright, the hijacker dressed as a priest, also told the negotiator he was ready to shoot a hostage. When the FBI backed down and agreed to provide the full sum, McNair says he was the one who took the risk of appearing at the door and tugging the ransom up to the plane. Some passengers were disappointed they wouldn't be able to collect their luggage until the plane came back from Algiers, but no shots were fired during and no-one was physically injured. If everything seemed to be going to plan there was one important detail they hadn't factored in. The pilot, Capt William May, had never flown across the Atlantic before, so they had to fly first to Boston, where an experienced  navigator climbed aboard - also in swimming trunks. The rest of the trip passed peacefully. While the male hijackers went to sleep, the two women watched over the crew and four stewardesses on the overnight flight. When they arrived in Algiers, the plane was ringed by soldiers and an official walked up the steps to the plane. His first words were, ""Bienvenue chez vous!"" (Welcome to your home.) Listen to: Radio 4's The British Black Panthers(2019, 57 minutes) Watch: Talking Movies - The rise and fall of the Black Panthers(2015, four minutes) McNair says the pilot was the real hero. ""When we arrived in Algiers we offered to pay the pilot for his services but he said, 'No thank you.' The pilot had persuaded the FBI and their sharpshooters that everything was calm on board. As we left the airplane we said, 'That's a job well done.' But afterwards we thought of how many things could have gone wrong."" The hijackers quickly realised that settling in Algeria was a strategic blunder. Most of the dozen or so Black Panthers who had congregated there were packing their bags or had already left, and relations between the Algerian government and the US were warming up. Eldridge Cleaver (right) holding court in Algiers The hijackers were told to hand over the $1m, which was sent back to the US - to the annoyance of the few Black Panthers remaining in Algiers, who seemed much more interested in the money than in the hijackers themselves. Over the next 14 months they lived in constant fear while housed in a compound in a suburb of Algiers - surrounded by strange and mysterious agents, some Algerian, others foreign including, McNair believes, US Navy Seals. McNair and Jean immediately realised they would have to send their children back to live with relatives in the US. ""Nothing is enjoyable about living a clandestine life. You are living in constant danger, you don't know what is going to come through the door, you sleep with one eye open. You are trying to be discreet - there is a lot of tension,"" says McNair. ""We knew the Panthers were leaving and we would be left holding the bag. They had outworn their stay - time had run out for the Panthers in Algeria."" Once again McNair and Jean fled, along with George Brown and Joyce Tillerson - this time to Paris, via Geneva, using fake passports and the support of international human rights groups. Arriving in Paris in autumn 1974, they lived with French sympathisers and supported themselves by doing odd jobs. Their cover story, if anyone asked, was that they had fled the US to avoid being called up to fight in Vietnam. The greatest hardship they endured was the separation from their children. When inevitably they were arrested by the French police in 1976, the US tried to extradite them but the French court accepted the argument that the case was political, and that it was American racism that should be on trial. But they had to be tried for hijacking in a French court and were held in pre-trial detention for two-and-a-half years. After the trial, the two women were released so that they could look after their children. McNair received a five-year jail sentence for the hijacking but it was reduced for good behaviour and for showing willingness to learn French. George Brown was in jail for longer, McNair says, because he didn't try to learn the language. McNair finally became a free man in May 1980 and the family was reunited again, after a break of eight years. McNair retrained as a social worker and sports coach and along with his wife Jean moved to the coastal town of Caen in Normandy in the early 1980s. Since then he has worked for charities on impoverished housing estates in a neighbourhood known as Grace de Dieu (Grace of God) on the outskirts of the town, and taught hundreds of local kids how to play baseball at the local club, Phenix Caen. The club's ground is even named after him and Jean, who also worked on social equality issues. His message to the kids is simple: ""What I went through and what I learned from the experience is good, and I made it through, which is good. So I can talk about it with kids at schools, and certain kids who don't want to listen hear my story and that's a wake up call to them - that they should do things differently, studying, working hard and respecting each other."" Teaching baseball in Caen in 2013 Jean died a few years ago and Melvin, now 72, continues to work as a mediator in the community. His role includes helping families understand where they can turn if they are facing financial difficulties, and trying to improve relations between kids on the estates and the local police. ""The only thing that has changed is that I don't get paid any more and I'm too old to play baseball,"" he chuckles. Two of his three children are French. The oldest, Johari, returned to the US and was shot dead in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, in 1998, at the age of 28. McNair says it appears he was in the wrong place at the wrong time in a turf war over drugs and stood up to one of the gang leaders. ""Everything I did was for him, and to protect him,"" he says, with tears running down his face, in the 2012 documentary Melvin & Jean: An American Story, directed by Maia Wechsler. ""And then I lost him."" Both his son and wife are buried in Caen and he says he will be too.

George Brown also remained in Paris, and died five years ago. The fifth, George Wright, went his own way to Guinea-Bissau in West Africa and then disappeared from the radar for decades, resurfacing in Portugal with Portuguese citizenship, where he lives to this day despite US efforts to extradite him. The pilot, William May, visited France for a happy reunion with the McNairs in the documentary, Melvin & Jean. They shook hands and hugged each other and bore no ill feelings. After the hijacking May went from flying domestic flights for Delta to international flights - a step up. McNair says he misses family back home, but he knows that if he returned he might be arrested, and he says he has no intention of going back to jail. He has admiration for the Black Lives Matter movement but worries when he hears about black militia taking up arms and training, even if their motive is purely defensive. He points to the Black Panthers, who had legitimate concerns about racism, he argues, but by taking up arms gave the US authorities a reason to wipe them out. And as for the hijacking that transformed his life, does he regret it? ""I always have regrets, in the sense that if you were more intelligent and less naive you wouldn't have made the mistakes that you did. I regret the racism that forced me into the desperate situation that forced me to react in the way I did. I regret that it has forced me into exile away from America and my family but I got a second chance to make positive change in the community I am in now.""

"The relationship between Prince Charles and Diana, Princess of Wales, is covered in series four Netflix says it will not warn viewers of The Crown some scenes are fiction. Responding to calls for a warning from Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden, the streaming giant said the series has always been billed as a drama. ""As a result we have no plans, and see no need, to add a disclaimer,"" it said. Mr Dowden earlier said younger viewers ""may mistake fiction for fact"" when watching the fourth series, which shows the breakdown of the marriage between the Prince and Princess of Wales. The Crown's creator Peter Morgan has called the show ""an act of creative imagination"" with a ""constant push-pull"" between research and drama.

"This video can not be played Donald Trump: ""If I lost, I'd be a very gracious loser"" US President Donald Trump has held his first rally after losing the US presidential election. The event in Georgia comes before key Senate runoff elections there in January, which will decide control of the upper house. Joe Biden is the first Democratic candidate to win the state in a presidential election since 1992. Mr Trump has repeatedly refused to admit his defeat and made numerous unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud. Ahead of the rally he criticised Georgia's Republican governor on Twitter, calling on him to help overturn Joe Biden's election victory in the state. In his speech on Saturday, however, the president seemed to admit his loss, claiming his foreign policy measures could be reversed under the incoming Democratic president-elect. Under the US constitution, Mr Biden will take office on 20 January regardless of whether Mr Trump admits defeat. Why Republicans are fighting in Georgia Mr Biden won the presidential election with 306 votes in the electoral college - the system the US uses to elect a president - to Mr Trump's 232. The college will meet on 14 December to formalise the outcome. Appearing in Valdosta, Georgia, for his first rally since the 3 November vote, Mr Trump again made claims of electoral fraud and attacked Governor Brian Kemp. Mr Trump has alleged throughout the election that the increase in postal ballots had led to widespread fraud, but there has been no evidence of this. In a speech nearly two hours long - nominally to support two Republican Senators campaigning for re-election - President Trump told the cheering crowd that he could still win the election. Repeating his unsubstantiated claims, he said ""they cheated and rigged our presidential election but we'll still win it"", adding that Mr Kemp should ""get a lot tougher"". The crowd - many waving ""Make America Great Again"" posters - chanted ""Stop the steal"" and ""Four more years"". Despite the euphoria of the event, some Republicans are concerned that the president's continuing allegations of fraud will discourage his supporters from voting in the Senate races by falsely convincing them that the system is rigged. Georgia's Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, said on Wednesday that no evidence of widespread fraud had been found to support Mr Trump's claims. An election official in the state, Gabriel Sterling, also a Republican, hasurged the president to tone down his fraud claims, saying they were inciting violent threats. This video can not be played ""This has to stop... someone's gonna get killed"": Mr Sterling calls on President Trump to condemn the threats The rally came after Mr Trump reportedly called Governor Kemp on Saturday morning and asked him to demand an audit of absentee ballot signatures, according to the Washington Post. Mr Kemp - who has no power to order such an audit - turned down the requests, a source told the newspaper. Then on Twitter, the president turned up the pressure on the governor, saying: ""I will easily & quickly win Georgia if Governor @BrianKempGA or the Secretary of State permit a simple signature verification ... Why are these two 'Republicans' saying no?"" Mr Kemp tweeted back that he had ""publicly called for a signature audit three times"", to which Trump responded by calling for a special session of the state legislature. Someone reportedly familiar with the call told CNN that Mr Trump told Mr Kemp to call the special session and convince legislators to pick electors who would support him. How you can be US president without winning most votes Under the US electoral college system, people vote for a president and then state electors - roughly in line with the population of their state - formally give their electoral college votes to a candidate. The state has two separate Senate races under way ahead of runoff elections on 5 January and both have a Republican incumbent squaring off against a Democratic newcomer. Senator David Perdue, 70, will compete against Jon Ossoff, 33, a documentary filmmaker. Senator Kelly Loeffler, 50, is facing off with Reverend Raphael Warnock, 51, a senior pastor at an Atlanta Baptist Church. Republican Senators Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue listened as President Trump addressed the crowd Recent polls show Mr Warnock pulling ahead of Ms Loeffler and the Perdue-Ossoff race in a dead heat. Mr Trump's Republican party currently has a slim majority in the upper chamber, and a victory in the run-offs would allow it to counter the Democratic administration of President-elect Biden. However, if the Democrats win the two remaining seats, they would control half the seats in the Senate - and the vice-president would be able to act as a tie-breaker. The Democrats already control the lower chamber - the House of Representatives. Can Trump still challenge the result?

"Hugh McManus was treated with a defibrillator after suffering a cardiac arrest at his Cushendall home in 2015 The government should fund the installation of defibrillators across public areas, a cardiac survivor has said. Hugh McManus was treated with a defibrillator after suffering a cardiac arrest at his Cushendall home in 2015. He said they should be as ""commonplace as fire extinguishers"". DUP MP Jim Shannon has proposed a bill calling for their installation in public buildings, including education and sports venues. Hugh, now in his 60s, was returning home from a golf course in Cushendall five years ago when he started to feel unwell. By the time he got home, his condition had worsened and his son called an ambulance. Defibrillators installed in Belfast parks 'Father of emergency medicine' celebrated Cushendall, County Antrim, is not easily reached by ambulance but Hugh said he was lucky local man, Joe Burns, had CPR training, a defibrillator and was designated as a first responder. He was able to assess Hugh's condition and applied two shocks through the device to bring Hugh's heart back to a more normal rhythm. Hugh was later operated on at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast. Hugh (centre) seen here with members of his family, wants defibrillators to be made more widely available He said he would not be alive if he had not received the defibrillator shocks. ""Ideally you would have one in every building where you have a large gathering of people, the window to save someone's life is so short. ""I'm immensely grateful to Joe and can never repay him - to save someone's life, what better thing could you do?"". He has now called on politicians to back the call for funding to ensure more life-saving devices are made publicly available. No-one should be afraid to use the automated devices, which have been designed to only apply a shock where necessary, he added. ""It's totally understandable that someone might be fearful of getting it wrong, but the way I see it, the alternative is that a person doesn't have that chance to live,"" he said. Strangford MP Jim Shannon has proposed a bill promoting access to defibrillators in public buildings TheAutomated External Defibrillators Bill,externalhad its first reading in the House of Commons last week. Mr Shannon said the push for ""mandatory installations of these life-saving devices in our public buildings must be welcomed"". ""We can no longer leave it to the public to hold raffles or coffee mornings,"" he said. ""We must consider it our duty as legislators to require Automated External Defibrillators to be present in public buildings, sporting facilities, places of education and wherever someone, be they young or elderly, might fall down and never get up again."" There are approximately 1,400 out-of-hospital cardiac arrests reported in Northern Ireland every year, according to the British Heart Foundation (BHF). The charity estimates that fewer than 10% of people survive and that public-access defibrillators are used in fewer than 5% of cardiac arrests that happen away from a hospital.

"The end of sledging and snowball fights in the UK? Snowy winters could become a thing of the past as climate change affects the UK, Met Office analysis suggests. It is one of a series of projections about how UK's climate could change, shared with BBC Panorama. It suggests by the 2040s most of southern England could no longer see sub-zero days. By the 2060s only high ground and northern Scotland are still likely to experience such cold days. The projections are based on global emissions accelerating. It could mean the end of sledging, snowmen and snowball fights, says Dr Lizzie Kendon, a senior Met Office scientist who worked on the climate projections. ""We're saying by the end of the century much of the lying snow will have disappeared entirely except over the highest ground,"" she told Panorama. If the world reduces emissions significantly the changes will be less dramatic, the Met Office says. What will climate change look like near me? The year 2020 set to be in top three warmest Covid pandemic has little impact on rise in CO2 Can sending fewer emails really save the planet? Warmer winters linked to increased drowning risk The average coldest day in the UK over the past three decades was -4.3 Celsius. If emissions continue to accelerate, leading to a global temperature rise of 4C, then the average coldest day in the UK would remain above 0 Celsius across most of the country throughout winter. Even if global emissions are reduced dramatically and world temperatures rise by 2C, the average coldest day in the UK is likely be 0 Celsius. The Met Office says these temperatures are subject to variation and some years may see days colder than the average. Its projections explore how the UK's climate might change. ""The overarching picture is warmer, wetter winters; hotter, drier summers,"" Dr Kendon says. ""But within that, we get this shift towards more extreme events, so more frequent and intense extremes, so heavier rainfall when it occurs."" The Met Office says we are already seeing dramatic changes in the UK climate. Picture postcard: Snow covered houses in Gold Hill in Shaftesbury, Dorset in 2019 ""The rate and nature of the climate change that we're seeing is unprecedented,"" says Dr Mark McCarthy of the Met Office's National Climate Information Centre. Most of the country has already seen average temperatures rise by 1C since the Industrial Revolution and we should expect more of the same, he warns. That may not sound like much, but even these small changes in our climate can have a huge impact on the weather and on many plants and animals. The Met Office says there could be significant temperature rises in the decades ahead for both winter and summer. It says the biggest increases will be in the already warmer southern parts of the UK. At the same time extreme weather is expected to become more frequent and more intense. Heatwaves are likely to become more common and last longer, with record temperatures being exceeded regularly. The average hottest day could reach a sweltering 40C the data suggests Not every summer will be hotter than the last, the Met Office says, but the long-term trend is steadily upwards, particularly if emissions remain unabated. That high-emissions scenario shows peak summer temperatures could rise by between 3.7 C and 6.8 C by the 2070s, compared with the period 1981 to 2000. If the world succeeds in reducing emissions, these temperature rises will be considerably smaller. The level of detail in the models mean it is possible to see how the climate might change in neighbourhoods across the country. This video can not be played The Wingfields' home in South Yorkshire has only just recovered after floods in 2019. Hayes in west London, for example, is likely to see some of the most dramatic temperature rises of all, the new data suggests. The average hottest day in Hayes was 32C around 20 years ago. If emissions continue to accelerate, the new Met Office data suggests the average hottest day could reach a sweltering 40C by around 2070. If global emissions reduce, this temperature rise will not be so severe. A really simple guide to climate change How much warmer is your city? Climate change: Where we are in seven charts What is 'net zero'? And other key terms explained ""I mean, I think it's really frightening. That's a big change, and we're talking about in the course of our lifetime. It's just a wake-up call really as to what we're talking about here,"" says Dr Kendon. Summers might not just be hotter, they could be drier too, the Met Office predicts. Summer rain could become less frequent, but when it does rain it is likely to be more intense. The combination of longer dry periods with sudden heavy downpours could increase the risk of flooding because dry ground doesn't absorb water as well as damp ground. Rainfall is expected to increase in many parts of the country in winter too, the Met Office says. The projections suggest western parts of the UK may get even wetter under a high-emissions scenario. Of course, some years will always buck the trend by being wetter or cooler than others - and there will be significant regional variations. This pattern of wetter winters and more intense summer downpours across much of the country risks putting infrastructure under greater strain. Roads, railways, reservoirs, sewers, bridges and other infrastructure is all designed for the sort of rainfall we have had in the past and much of it may need to be upgraded or even rebuilt to cope with the storms and floods to come. Last week, the UK government announced ambitious new targets for tackling climate change. The new goal is to cut the UK's greenhouse gas emission by 68% by the end of the decade, based on 1990 levels. Boris Johnson hopes the new targets will set an example to other nations, which will join a virtual climate pledges summit on 12 December. This virtual event will occur in place of annual UN climate talks, which were set to have taken place in Glasgow this year, but were postponed because of Covid-19.

"This video can not be played Health Secretary Jeane Freeman says âall options are on the table at this pointâ The health secretary has revised her claim that parts of Scotland could stay in level four when Covid restrictions are reviewed on 11 December. Eleven areas, including most of central Scotland, are currently at the highest alert level. The first minister has previously said that the toughest restrictions would be lifted at 18:00 next Friday. Jeane Freeman initially told BBC Scotland that ""all options are on the table"". But she later said her comments were meant to be in respect of which levels the 11 areas would drop down to. The health secretary said a cabinet decision would be reached on Tuesday morning with Nicola Sturgeon announcing the details later that day. Ms Freeman's earlier comments onthe BBC's Politics Scotland programmeappeared to contradict what the first minister said at the government's coronavirus briefing on 20 November. Is your area in the toughest level? No change to Scotland's local Covid alert levels What are the rules in your area? When will I be vaccinated against Covid? A reality check on the virus's second wave Nicola Sturgeon was asked by the BBC's Aileen Clarke whether she could provide reassurances to businesses in level four areas - including hospitality and hairdressers - that they could confidently plan to reopen in December. Ms Sturgeon said: ""Level four restrictions in the areas will be lifted on the 11th of December. Before then we will have to make an assessment based on up-to-date data at the time about what levels these areas then go into. ""Will they go back to level three or could some of them go to level two? We can't make that assessment right now because we need to wait and see what the data is, but the level four restrictions will be lifted on the 11th of December."" Ms Freeman was asked on Politics Scotland about the chances of restrictions on nearly 2.3 million people in level four areas remaining - possibly until Christmas. She said: ""Right now, as is always the case in advance of these reviews, a great deal of work is going on - analysing the data, talking to colleagues on local authorities, taking senior clinical advice. ""All of this is designed to help us reach a judgement about what is the right thing to do. ""All options are on the table just now as you would expect them to be. People shouldn't read from that any decision one way or the other. ""The work goes on over the weekend so that we have the most up-to-date data, the most up-do-date clinical advice. That's important and it's a big responsibility that we get that right for people across Scotland."" Ms Freeman later tweeted: ""11 local authorities currently in Level 4 will come out of that level on Friday. That position has not changed. ""The Cabinet will decide on Tuesday what level below 4 they'll go into. My comments were intended to mean in respect of that decision, all options are on the table."" It comes asa further five people who tested positivefor coronavirus were recorded to have died in the past 24 hours. There are currently 951 people in hospital with a positive Covid test and 62 of those are in ICU. The Scottish Conservatives said the ""mixed messaging"" from the health secretary created uncertainty and was ""extremely unhelpful just days away from the latest review"". The party's health spokesman Donald Cameron said: ""The questions she was asked could not have been clearer. These restrictions affect millions of people and they deserve a clear and consistent message from SNP ministers. ""While it is welcome that the government has eventually confirmed these restrictions will end, there was absolutely no need for this speculation to occur in the first place."" Labour's Monica Lennon said: ""It's worrying that the first minister and the health secretary are contradicting each other on something as serious as the level four restrictions, leaving businesses and millions of Scots in limbo. ""This is no way to handle a pandemic."" Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said ministers had consistently failed to demonstrate the right measures were being put in place to cut infection rates and facilitate an easing of restrictions. He said: ""The public need a clear and effective plan of action, not guessing games."" The areas currently under level four restrictions are East Ayrshire, East Dunbartonshire, East Renfrewshire, Glasgow, North Lanarkshire, Renfrewshire, South Ayrshire, South Lanarkshire, Stirling, West Dunbartonshire, West Lothian.

"Hugh McManus was treated with a defibrillator after suffering a cardiac arrest at his Cushendall home in 2015 The government should fund the installation of defibrillators across public areas, a cardiac survivor has said. Hugh McManus was treated with a defibrillator after suffering a cardiac arrest at his Cushendall home in 2015. He said they should be as ""commonplace as fire extinguishers"". DUP MP Jim Shannon has proposed a bill calling for their installation in public buildings, including education and sports venues. Hugh, now in his 60s, was returning home from a golf course in Cushendall five years ago when he started to feel unwell. By the time he got home, his condition had worsened and his son called an ambulance. Defibrillators installed in Belfast parks 'Father of emergency medicine' celebrated Cushendall, County Antrim, is not easily reached by ambulance but Hugh said he was lucky local man, Joe Burns, had CPR training, a defibrillator and was designated as a first responder. He was able to assess Hugh's condition and applied two shocks through the device to bring Hugh's heart back to a more normal rhythm. Hugh was later operated on at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast. Hugh (centre) seen here with members of his family, wants defibrillators to be made more widely available He said he would not be alive if he had not received the defibrillator shocks. ""Ideally you would have one in every building where you have a large gathering of people, the window to save someone's life is so short. ""I'm immensely grateful to Joe and can never repay him - to save someone's life, what better thing could you do?"". He has now called on politicians to back the call for funding to ensure more life-saving devices are made publicly available. No-one should be afraid to use the automated devices, which have been designed to only apply a shock where necessary, he added. ""It's totally understandable that someone might be fearful of getting it wrong, but the way I see it, the alternative is that a person doesn't have that chance to live,"" he said. Strangford MP Jim Shannon has proposed a bill promoting access to defibrillators in public buildings TheAutomated External Defibrillators Bill,externalhad its first reading in the House of Commons last week. Mr Shannon said the push for ""mandatory installations of these life-saving devices in our public buildings must be welcomed"". ""We can no longer leave it to the public to hold raffles or coffee mornings,"" he said. ""We must consider it our duty as legislators to require Automated External Defibrillators to be present in public buildings, sporting facilities, places of education and wherever someone, be they young or elderly, might fall down and never get up again."" There are approximately 1,400 out-of-hospital cardiac arrests reported in Northern Ireland every year, according to the British Heart Foundation (BHF). The charity estimates that fewer than 10% of people survive and that public-access defibrillators are used in fewer than 5% of cardiac arrests that happen away from a hospital. Fearghal McKinney, head of BHF NI, said cardiac arrest survival rates remained ""shockingly low"" in Northern Ireland. ""When someone has a cardiac arrest, every minute without CPR or defibrillation reduces their survival chances by around 10%,"" he added. ""Making defibrillators more readily available could help save lives, but must be supported by the roll out of mandatory CPR training in all secondary schools. ""We need to give everyone who suffers a cardiac arrest the best chance of survival.

"Victoria Codling, pictured with her husband, has started a petition There are calls for an alternative to school contact groups isolating for 14 days after a classmate tests positive. Some parents say their children have isolated three times in the past three months - and that it is detrimental to their wellbeing. A petition to the Senedd also says working parents are suffering, with employers not always sympathetic if they have to stay home with children. The Welsh Government said it was working hard on testing developments. ""We are sorry to hear about these experiences,"" a Welsh Government spokeswoman said. ""We are learning more about the virus all the time and experts from across the UK regularly review the self-isolation guidance to make sure the length of time is right to stop it being passed on to other people."" Schools generally keep the same bubble or group of children together to reduce the number that has to isolate if a pupil tests positive for coronavirus - but parents say these groups can end up being large. Almost half of Welsh schools report Covid cases 'No help' for single parents as children isolate Close schools early for Christmas, says union Mass Covid testing considered at Wales' schools Kate Bradley, from Newport, said her son in Year 9 had just finished a period of isolation and, after one day back at school, had been told to isolate again. Ms Bradley said: ""He had felt so anxious about going back and now I feel dreadful for telling him it would all be fine, and it wasn't. ""He had one day back, and now it's another two weeks of no sports, no socialising, no going outside."" And her daughter, in Year 7, having dealt with starting secondary school after months off in the first lockdown and missing all the build-up, has already had to isolate twice. ""My son is normally very positive about school and seeing his friends, but even he's reached the point where he's had enough of it hanging over his head. ""I can't praise the school enough, I think they've done absolutely everything that they can, it's a very Covid-secure school - it's the rules [that are the problem]."" Some schools are isolating small numbers of pupils while others have larger bubbles, parents say Children are not able to leave the house at all for 14 days and cannot go out to exercise after potential contact with a positive case, under the current rules. ""We are big rule-followers, and the children just want to keep people safe. We've seen my mum once, outdoors, since August,"" Ms Bradley said. ""But self-isolation is worse than lockdown because at least then you could go out for a walk or a bike ride, but this is just in the house and there is nothing to do, it's like a prison sentence. ""My son noticed how unfit so many children were when he went back to play football after the first lockdown so it's not so much about learning, the home learning our school has offered has been excellent, it's about exercise, social interaction."" Ms Bradley said she did not wish to criticise any school, but she believed there must be a safe alternative. ""I don't think there are many adults who have had to self-isolate in the way these children are, you wouldn't expect any adult to [spend] eight weeks out of the last 12 isolating, so there has to be a safe answer and we owe it to our children to find it."" The author of the petition, Victoria Codling, who also has children at a school in Newport, believed a negative test after five days of isolating could be a solution -as is the case in England for people arriving in the country from abroad. Face coverings outside the classroom are compulsory in secondary schools to try and prevent the spread According to Ms Codling's petition, which has received more than 800 signatures: ""Isolating for 14 days is so detrimental to their mental and physical wellbeing, it is disproportionate to the risk of their exposure to coronavirus in the first place. ""Some children are enduring their third period of isolation in as many months. Children with additional needs or from disadvantaged backgrounds are even more adversely affected. ""Working (non-isolating) parents are suffering with employers not always sympathetic in these tough economic times."" There are also concerns from supporters of the petition over the workload of teachers having to simultaneously teach children in school and those isolating and learning online. Ms Codling told BBC News she had heard of young children staying in their bedrooms with no human contact, having food brought to them. She added that people were terrified of being asked to isolate towards the end of term - meaning they would have to do so over Christmas. ""I dread to think how much school has been missed,"" she said. Ms Codling added that, while some schools were sending home small groups of pupils who have had contact, others were asking entire year groups to self-isolate. ""They can't run, they can't exercise, some are staying in one room of the house having food brought to them when they don't have any symptoms. ""But then their parents and siblings don't have to isolate at all, parents are confused - it is confusing. ""Some children will cope fine with distance-learning and talking to their friends on Zoom but some don't understand the change in their routine and just don't cope - it's their normality, it's not just about education but social and emotional development."" The Welsh Government added: ""Testing technology is developing all the time and we are working hard to make sure that these new developments are available for use as soon as possible in Wales. ""We know the pandemic has had a huge impact on everyone, but especially on children and young people. ""Support is available if people need it - this includes through our CALL mental health helpline and the Young Persons Mental Health Toolkit.""

"More than 90% of Welsh lamb exports are destined for EU markets Sheep farmers will receive financial help if no trade deal is reached with the European Union, the UK's environment secretary has said. George Eustice said sheep farming would need financial support ""because it exports quite a lot to the EU"". The Welsh Government's Brexit minister said the Treasury ""need to commit to that being available"" because funding promises ""have already been broken"". UK chief negotiator Lord Frostis continuing post-Brexit trade talks. The UK left the EU in January but entered a transition period until the end of 2020 in which the trading rules remained broadly the same. 'Welsh farmers too reliant on exporting to the EU' 'Deal to be done' as UK-EU trade talks resume If a deal is not reached, from 1 January border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. With more than 90% of Welsh lamb exports destined for EU markets, Mr Eustice said the sector ""perhaps more than any other sector...is likely  by to be impacted"" if there is no trade deal. ""We have already developed potential interventions to support the sector in the short term should that be needed,"" he said. ""It's important to realise as well that demand globally is currently very high - lamb prices are some 15% to 20% higher than they were last year. ""So, we will keep a very close eye on this sector, and we'll be ready to intervene if needed, but it's not clear at this stage that we would need to."" Speaking on theBBC Politics Wales programme, Montgomeryshire's Conservative MP Craig Williams said: ""Everyone around that [UK Government] cabinet table... has assured me that the cheque book will open instantly, regulations will be looked at and support will be put in place [for the Welsh lamb sector]. ""We don't want a no deal. Sheep farmers, especially, don't want a no deal. ""But let nobody the other side of the English Channel be in any doubt, we'll have it if they're not going to treat us like an independent sovereign nation, and we'll cope."" Earlier in the week, First Minister Mark Drakeford said plans for Holyhead Port show""just how shambolic"" UK ministers have been on Brexit. Mr Drakeford said the UK government was ""in a scramble to resolve"" issues around the Anglesey port as it entered talks to purchase a transport cafe near Holyhead for a customs site. Responding to the first minister's comments, Mr Eustice said a phased approach to introducing checks was always the intention. He added: ""That meant that we didn't need to have all of that infrastructure in place at Holyhead."" But some customs checks will start on 1 January 2021 and therefore, until the site is operational,checks for lorries arriving at Holyhead Port will initially take place in Warrington. As well as the joint site with the UK government in Holyhead, the Welsh Government is looking at two potential sites for food safety, and animal and plant health checks in the south west of Wales to deal with lorries arriving at Pembroke and Fishguard ports. HMRC intends to conduct customs checks at the ports themselves in the new year. The food and plant checks will start in July but the Welsh Government's Counsel General Jeremy Miles said: ""We think there's a serious risk, both in north Wales and in the south west, that the arrangements won't be ready for July of next year because of the delay in getting the sites selected and those are choices the UK Government have made very recently."" Mr Miles also said he expected ""disruption at the ports"" following the transition period ""because of new frictions at the border"". He added: ""We have plans to provide stacking for traffic as it approaches Holyhead."" Dublin politician and Fine Gael European affairs spokesman Neale Richmond said the Irish capital's port has ""now doubled in size"" and would be ready for 1 January. But he told BBC Politics Wales: ""What we are seeing though, unfortunately, is a lot of exporters from Ireland... they are looking more and more at the direct shipping links. ""So, you would have seen last week the announcement of the new link from Wexford to Dunkirk. ""We're seeing new sailings to Santander, to Lisbon, to Zeebrugge and we hope to see a new one to Le Havre too because people cannot countenance possible delays, be it getting in and out of Holyhead or getting in and out of Dover.""

"Hugh McManus was treated with a defibrillator after suffering a cardiac arrest at his Cushendall home in 2015 The government should fund the installation of defibrillators across public areas, a cardiac survivor has said. Hugh McManus was treated with a defibrillator after suffering a cardiac arrest at his Cushendall home in 2015. He said they should be as ""commonplace as fire extinguishers"". DUP MP Jim Shannon has proposed a bill calling for their installation in public buildings, including education and sports venues. Hugh, now in his 60s, was returning home from a golf course in Cushendall five years ago when he started to feel unwell. By the time he got home, his condition had worsened and his son called an ambulance. Defibrillators installed in Belfast parks 'Father of emergency medicine' celebrated Cushendall, County Antrim, is not easily reached by ambulance but Hugh said he was lucky local man, Joe Burns, had CPR training, a defibrillator and was designated as a first responder. He was able to assess Hugh's condition and applied two shocks through the device to bring Hugh's heart back to a more normal rhythm. Hugh was later operated on at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast. Hugh (centre) seen here with members of his family, wants defibrillators to be made more widely available He said he would not be alive if he had not received the defibrillator shocks. ""Ideally you would have one in every building where you have a large gathering of people, the window to save someone's life is so short. ""I'm immensely grateful to Joe and can never repay him - to save someone's life, what better thing could you do?"". He has now called on politicians to back the call for funding to ensure more life-saving devices are made publicly available. No-one should be afraid to use the automated devices, which have been designed to only apply a shock where necessary, he added. ""It's totally understandable that someone might be fearful of getting it wrong, but the way I see it, the alternative is that a person doesn't have that chance to live,"" he said. Strangford MP Jim Shannon has proposed a bill promoting access to defibrillators in public buildings TheAutomated External Defibrillators Bill,externalhad its first reading in the House of Commons last week. Mr Shannon said the push for ""mandatory installations of these life-saving devices in our public buildings must be welcomed"". ""We can no longer leave it to the public to hold raffles or coffee mornings,"" he said. ""We must consider it our duty as legislators to require Automated External Defibrillators to be present in public buildings, sporting facilities, places of education and wherever someone, be they young or elderly, might fall down and never get up again."" There are approximately 1,400 out-of-hospital cardiac arrests reported in Northern Ireland every year, according to the British Heart Foundation (BHF). The charity estimates that fewer than 10% of people survive and that public-access defibrillators are used in fewer than 5% of cardiac arrests that happen away from a hospital. Fearghal McKinney, head of BHF NI, said cardiac arrest survival rates remained ""shockingly low"" in Northern Ireland. ""When someone has a cardiac arrest, every minute without CPR or defibrillation reduces their survival chances by around 10%,"" he added. ""Making defibrillators more readily available could help save lives, but must be supported by the roll out of mandatory CPR training in all secondary schools. ""We need to give everyone who suffers a cardiac arrest the best chance of survival. "" The bill presented by Mr Shannon had previously been proposed twice by MP Maria Caulfield, but was delayed by the dissolution of government. It will move to a second reading on 5 February 2021.

"The royal couple asked ""doodle boy"" Joe Whale to mark the three-day tour with a drawing The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are embarking on a three-day tour on board the royal train to thank community workers and frontline staff in the UK. Prince William and Catherine will meet care home staff, teachers, pupils and volunteers to hear about the challenges they have faced during the pandemic. A spokeswoman said they were ""looking forward to shining a spotlight on the incredible work that has been done"". The 1,250 mile-journey will include stops in England, Scotland and Wales. The duke and duchess will board the royal train on Sunday, for what is believed to be Catherine's first official journey on board. Prince William has used the train a number of times, including on the day of his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales' funeral, in 1997 - when the prince travelled from London to the princess's ancestral home in Northamptonshire for her burial. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's tour will celebrate community achievements during the pandemic A Kensington Palace spokeswoman said the morale-boosting tour, which ends on Tuesday, would give the royal couple the chance to ""share their gratitude on behalf of the nation"" for all those supporting their local communities ahead of the Christmas holidays. The UK's arts sector, which has been badly hit during the pandemic, will also be celebrated, with a number of festive performances. All visits and official events will be conducted in line with government's coronavirus guidance. At the request of the royal couple, the forthcoming trip has been immortalised in a drawing by schoolboy artist Joe Whale, better known as the ""doodle boy"", who found worldwide fame during lockdown with his YouTube tutorials. Prince Charles's study on the royal train, as pictured in 2010 Queen Victoria was the first monarch to use the royal train, travelling from Slough to Paddington station on 13 June 1842, with Isambard Kingdom Brunel riding on the footplate. In her diary, the 23-year-old queen described the 25-minute journey as ""delightful and so quick"" The present train has nine carriages and came into service for the Queen's Silver Jubilee, in 1977. It includes private carriages for the Queen and the Prince of Wales The train is described as more functional than palatial, with one royal aide suggesting it has bathroom fixtures ""you could find in Homebase or B&Q"" Only three trips - two by the Prince of Wales and one by the Queen - were taken on the royal train in the 2019/2020 financial year, but the total cost was more than Â£63,000. When the Queen toured the UK on the train for her Golden Jubilee in 2002, it cost Â£872,000 In 2000, a royal bodyguard discharged his gun on the train while the Queen was sleeping.

"This video can not be played A video released in 2018 showed the original plan for the crossing in virtual form A new tunnel linking Kent and Essex will create five million tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2), figures suggest. Estimates say building the Lower Thames Crossing (LTC), a flagship project in the UK's roads programme, will emit 2 million tonnes of the greenhouse gas. Meanwhile, traffic created by the road is expected to generate another 3.2 million tonnes over 60 years. Environmentalists say the statistics make a mockery of the prime ministerâs claim to lead on climate change. A government report published in March provisionally estimated the UK's net carbon emissions in 2019 to be 351.5 million tonnes. The Thames crossing,externalis said to be the UK's biggest roads project since the M25. Ministers say the scheme, supported by the CBI and the AA, will bring a huge economic boost on both sides of the river and relieve congestion on the orbital motorway. But the emissions figures, obtained through aFreedom of Information request,externalafter Highways England initially declined to release them, have angered environmentalists. Campaigners say the tunnel should never have been proposed without a debate on the projected CO2 impacts, and have demanded the government freeze all projects that will increase emissions. Environmentalists have been campaigning for the Highways Agency to publish a CO2 analysis of its full road-building programme. Other schemes will also generate CO2, such as the planned Stonehenge tunnel, which is expected to create half a million tonnes during construction. Chris Todd, from green group Transport Action Network, told BBC News: âIf the government is serious about tackling climate change, it can't keep ignoring the emissions roads are causing"". Boris Johnson, who will host a global climate conference on Saturday, has pledged to cut the UKâs emissions by 68% against 1990 levels) by the end of this decade. Heâs encouraging other nations to follow suit with ambitious offers as the climate warms. 'Mass trespass' staged at Stonehenge over tunnel Mr Todd said: âWe welcome greater ambition from the PM on the international stage, but itâs very easy to make announcements without taking action â and right now transport policy is making a mockery of his promises.â The eventual CO2 outputs for the roads should be lower than projected because of the advent of electric cars. But campaigners point out that making and running EVs still takes a great deal of energy and resources. The tunnel, shown here in a computer-generated image, is designed to reduce congestion elsewhere This row is part of a bigger critique of the UKâs whole infrastructure programme. The Prime Minister is an enthusiastic supporter of eye-catching concrete-heavy projects. But these typically carry a high carbon cost. Meanwhile other less telegenic forms of infrastructure create more jobs than mega-projects, and quickly start to save CO2 emissions overall. Refurbishing homes, for instance, is estimated to create four times more jobs than road building. Improving broadband can take cars off the road,according to the AA, by improving employees' ability to work from home. This also meets the wish of Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, whosays more people need to switch away from their cars. In his recent statement, the Chancellor promised Â£27bn to roads, Â£100bn to HS2 and just Â£1bn next year for his Green Homes Grant to insulate dwellings. A Highways England spokesperson told BBC News: ""The Lower Thames Crossing is the UKâs most ambitious roads project in a generation, which will add billions to the national, regional and local economies by almost doubling road capacity between Kent and Essex and reducing delays. âBut it will also impact on the environment and minimising this impact is a key priority for us. Our proposed design includes the UKâs longest road tunnel as it offers the best possible local environmental benefits, âHowever, tunnels by their nature require large volumes of concrete with a high carbon footprint.â Highways England told BBC News it has changed construction methods to reduce emissions.

"This video can not be played Professor Lisa Harvey-Smith: The asteroid sample is ''exciting key'' to the origins of the Solar System A capsule containing the first significant quantities of rock from an asteroid is in ""perfect"" shape, according to scientists. The container with material from a space rock called Ryugu parachuted down near Woomera in South Australia on Saturday evening (GMT). A recovery team in Australia found the spacecraft lying on the sandy ground, with its parachute draped over a bush. The samples were originally collected by the Japanese spacecraft Hayabusa-2. The spacecraft spent more than a year investigating Ryugu before returning to Earth. As it approached our planet, Hayabusa-2 released the capsule with the samples and fired its engines to push off in another direction. The 16kg capsule, meanwhile, entered the Earth's atmosphere. The official Hayabusa-2 Twitter accountreported that the capsule and its parachute had been found,externalat 19:47 GMT. ""Hayabusa-2 is home,"" Dr Yuichi Tsuda, project manager for the mission, said at a press conference on Sunday morning (GMT) in Sagamihara, Japan. ""We collected the treasure box,"" he said, adding: ""The capsule collection was perfectly done."" Rocks from an asteroid set for delivery to Earth Asteroid mission exploring a 'rubble pile' He said there was no damage to the container. A team member carries the capsule, which contains samples from an asteroid Dr Hitoshi Kuninaka, director general of Japan's Institute for Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS), said: ""We started development of Hayabusa-2 in 2011. I think the dream has come true."" Addressing journalists, he acknowledged past missions that had experienced technical problems, but said: ""Regarding Hayabusa-2, we did everything according to the schedule - 100%. And we succeeded in sample return as planned. As a result, we can move on to the next stage in space development."" The next stage includes a mission called MMX, which will aim to bring back samples from Mars' largest moon Phobos. Earlier on Saturday, the capsule was picked up by cameras as a dazzling fireball streaking over Australia's Coober Pedy region. Screaming towards Earth at 11km/s, it deployed parachutes to slow its descent. The capsule then began transmitting a beacon with information about its position. The capsule is packed into a protective box for transport to the ""quick look facility"" Cameras in Australia captured the fireball as the capsule re-entered the atmosphere The spacecraft touched down on the vast Woomera range, operated by the Royal Australian Air Force. At around 18:07 GMT (04:37 local time), the recovery team identified the position of the capsule on the ground. A helicopter, equipped with an antenna to pick up the beacon, took to the air shortly afterwards. Satoru Nakazawa, Hayabusa-2 sub-manager at the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (Jaxa), who was part of the operation at Woomera, described the search: ""We went there with the helicopter and it was emitting the beacon signal. But at that time, it was still dark, so it was unclear [where it was]. I was very, very nervous. ""We flew over the area [where it landed] many times and I thought maybe that was where it was. Then the Sun rose and we could visually confirm the existence of the capsule. We thought: 'Wow, we found it!"" ""But we had a very jittery, frustrating time until sunrise."" The capsule was then taken to a ""quick-look facility"" for inspection. On Monday, Jaxa said it had collected gases from inside the container for analysis, adding that it was still not known whether they come from the Ryugu sample. Allow Twitter content?

Afterwards, the capsule will be airlifted to Japan, where it will be transported to a curation chamber at Jaxa in Sagamihara for analysis and storage. The mission planned to collect a sample of more than 100mg from the asteroid Ryugu. Japan probe touches down on asteroid New asteroid rover images released Prof Alan Fitzsimmons, from Queen's University Belfast, said the sample would ""reveal a huge amount, not only about the history of the Solar System, but about these particular objects as well"". Asteroids are essentially leftover building materials from the formation of the Solar System. They're made of the same stuff that went into forming the Earth, but they avoided being incorporated into planets. ""Having samples from an asteroid like Ryugu will be really exciting for our field. We think Ryugu is made up of super-ancient rocks that will tell us how the Solar System formed,"" Prof Sara Russell, leader of the planetary materials group at London's Natural History Museum, told BBC News. Studying the samples from Ryugu could tell us how water and the ingredients for life were delivered to the early Earth. A rover deployed by Hayabusa-2 sent back this image from the surface of Ryugu It had long been thought that comets delivered much of the Earth's water in the early days of the Solar System. Alan Fitzsimmons said the chemical profile of water in comets was sometimes rather different from the profile of water in our planet's oceans. The water composition of some asteroids in the outer Solar System, however, is a much closer match. Ryugu probably originated in this cold zone, before migrating inwards to its current orbit, closer to Earth. ""It may be that we've been looking to comets all this time for delivering water to Earth in the early Solar System. Perhaps we should have been looking a bit closer to home, at these primitive but rather rocky asteroids,"" Prof Fitzsimmons told BBC News. ""Indeed that's something that will be looked at very carefully in these Ryugu samples."" Researchers from around Japan, and other countries, will be working with the samples. In the UK, Prof Russell's team at the Natural History Museum and scientists from the universities of Manchester and Glasgow will get to study the material. Dr Sarah Crowther is one of several researchers at Manchester expecting to receive samples next year. She explained: ""Different labs contribute different expertise, which all helps in understanding the material collected."" The Hayabusa-2 spacecraft, which bypassed the Earth after releasing its capsule, is being sent on another mission. It will now travel to a much smaller, 30m-wide asteroid, reaching it in 2031.

"This video can not be played Fifty hospitals in England have been chosen as hubs for administering the vaccine The coronavirus vaccine is the ""beginning of the end"" of the epidemic in the UK, Prof Stephen Powis has said, as vaccinations begin on Tuesday. But the NHS England medical director warned the distribution of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine would be a ""marathon not a sprint"". It will take ""many months"" to vaccinate everybody who needs it, he said. Frontline health staff, those over 80, and care home workers will be first to get the Covid-19 vaccine. In England, 50 hospitals have been initially chosen to serve as hubs for administering the vaccine. Scotland,Wales, andNorthern Irelandwill also begin their vaccination programmes from hospitals on Tuesday. Prof Powis was speaking outside Croydon University Hospital in south London, which became one of the first hospitals in the UK to take delivery of the vaccine on Sunday. Vaccines were delivered to Croydon University Hospital on Sunday It comes as a further 231 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported in the latest UK government figures, and a further 17,272 cases. Health Secretary Matt Hancock described the start of the vaccination scheme as ""a historic moment"". ""I urge everybody to play their part to suppress this virus and follow the local restrictions to protect the NHS while they carry out this crucial work,"" he said. What are the safety checks for vaccines How will I get a vaccine? NHS staff: 'Vaccine is a game changer' Refrigerated containers holding the vaccine doseshave been arriving in the UK from Belgium, and are being prepared to be moved from secure locations to the hospitals. Prof Powis said despite ""huge complexities"", the first doses would arrive at hospitals on Monday, to be ready to administer from Tuesday. ""As a doctor this is a really exciting moment,"" he said. ""NHS staff around the country at vaccination hubs have been working tirelessly to make sure that we are prepared to commence vaccination on Tuesday."" He added: ""The NHS has a strong record of delivering large scale vaccination programmes - from the flu jab, HPV vaccine and lifesaving MMR jabs."" About 800,000 doses of the vaccine are expected to be available in the UK from next week. So far the government has ordered a total of 40 million doses - enough to vaccinate 20 million people, with two shots each, 21 days apart. With limited quantities initially available, elderly people who are already attending hospital as an outpatient, as well as those who are being discharged home after a hospital stay, will be among the first to receive the jab. Others over the age of 80 will be invited to attend the hospital to receive a jab, and care home providers will be able to book their staff into vaccination clinics. Any appointments not used for these groups will be used for healthcare workers who are at highest risk of serious illness from the virus. Dr June Raine, chief executive of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), said people could have ""real confidence"" in the vaccine, adding: ""The highest standards of scrutiny, of safety and of effectiveness and quality have been met, international standards."" She also said the MHRA would also be ""following up all the safety issues after rollout incredibly carefully. Our job doesn't end when rollout starts."" Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Dr Raine vowedthe vaccine will reach everyone in the UK who needs it - whatever the outcome of post-Brexit trade talks, saying officials were ""fully prepared"". This video can not be played How will the new Pfizer vaccine work? Because the Pfizer vaccine needs to stored and moved carefully each container is being inspected to ensure the vaccine vials have reached the UK in perfect condition. Tracking data covering every box's journey from Belgium is being downloaded to check that the vials have been kept well below freezing. The boxes each contain five packs of 975 doses, and will be split into smaller packs to be distributed around the country and defrosted. The vaccine is made in Belgium and has to be stored at around -70C Although care home residents and staff are top of the priority list agreed by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), they may not get the vaccine first ""for operational reasons"". Prof Anthony Harnden - deputy chair of the JCVI -told the BBC on Fridaysaid the committee would ""closely monitor"" delivery and stressed he still expected care home residents ""to be prioritised"". Mr Hancock said the government was doing everything it could to overcome ""significant challenges"" to ensure care home residents were vaccinated as soon as possible. Speaking to the Sunday Telegraph,external, the health secretary said fast-track approval of the Covid jab meant restrictions might be relaxed before the end of March next year. As well as the challenge of delivering the vaccine, health experts are also conscious that the public needs to be educated and persuaded to support the vaccination programme. A host of famous faces,externalincluding chat show host Sir Michael Parkinson and the singer Lulu, have told the Sunday Mirror that they will take the coronavirus vaccine without hesitation. It follows concerns thatonline misinformation about vaccines could turn some people against being vaccinated. The Mail on Sunday,externalreports that the Queen is expected to receive the vaccine ""within weeks"" before revealing she has had it to boost public take-up of the jab. The paper quotes senior sources who say the 94-year-old monarch and her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, 99, will not get ""preferential treatment"" and will ""wait in line"" during the first wave of jabs reserved for the over-80s and care home residents.

"The sheriff's department said the images were photoshopped on to the tree A sheriff's department in the US state of Alabama has come under fire over a Facebook photo showing a Christmas tree adorned with mugshots of suspects. It called the decorations ""thugshots"" in a Facebook post on Thursday that drew thousands of negative comments. Local civil liberties groups have described the post as ""despicable"". A sheriff spokeswoman for Mobile County Sheriff's Department defended the image, saying it represented criminals who were repeat offenders. In a Facebook post sharing the image, the department said: ""We have decorated our Tree with THUGSHOTS to show how many Thugs we have taken off the streets of Mobile this year! We could not have done it without our faithful followers!"" The post, which has since been removed, drew 7,900 comments, according to the Associated Press news agency. While some of the reaction was positive, many people responded saying the decorations were demeaning and cruel, the agency reports. Bernard Simelton, president of Alabama's National Association for the Advancement of Colored People,criticised the ""despicable behaviour"" of the police department,external, Al.com news website reported. The American Civil Liberties Union of Alabama (ACLU) has condemned the tree, calling it ""divisive and cruel"". The civil rights organisation's director, JaTaune Bosby, said most of those arrested had struggled with mental health problems and drug abuse.

"The collapse of the Debenhams and Arcadia retail empires is likely to leave large gaps in High Streets and shopping centres up and down the UK. If history is a guide, it may be years until some of these shops reopen, while many never will. It is now more than four years since the closure of BHS, the last large department store chain to be wiped from the High Street. Yet 24% of its stores still lie empty. Those premises that have been put to use have been snapped up by expanding  brands such as Primark, B&M Bargains, H&M and Sports Direct, says Ronald Nyakairu, senior manager at the Local Data Company (LDC) But even among smaller stores which closed their doors amid the slow decline of bricks-and-mortar retailers before coronavirus, many are vacant or have been demolished or converted, according to LDC data. Its analysis suggests that bigger premises, such as those formerly occupied by Toys 'R' Us or House of Fraser, have been harder to re-let. This probably spells a permanent change that landlords and local authorities need to get used to and even seize, says Bill Grimsey, former head of Wickes, Iceland and Focus DIY. He has led three reports into the future of town centres and High Streets. ""You can't rely on retail any more for your town centres and High Streets as the main attraction, because of technology, because of the internet,"" he says. ""You need to reinvent these places for something else because we are social animals and we need to have a place to congregate and it won't be just shops."" He concedes that managers of his generation were ""part of the cohort than cloned every town centre"" with the same shop chains, and that a return to vibrant towns with individual attractions is needed. He envisages a mix of health, education, entertainment, leisure, arts and crafts and green spaces. Some old shops could become housing, he adds. He urges local authorities to take a lead, even through means such as compulsory purchase to stop empty buildings going to waste. ""It's a big change that's needed and that requires local leaders to find the owners and start to recognise that repurposing them is the way forward."" Cities that have suffered less during the High Street recession are those such as Brighton, Manchester and Leeds that have relied less on shops, says Paul Swinney, director of policy and research at the Centre for Cities. These centres have more office space and higher-paid workers, who have then propped up bars, restaurants and shops after work. For department stores in popular areas, there are ways to cope with fewer sales in-store, he says, pointing to John Lewis's application to convert part of itsflagship London store to office space,external. But he cautions that for smaller towns whose custom may be dwindling, that will not be an option, and stronger medicine will be needed. Many BHS stores, like this one in Bolton, remain closed While Mr Grimsey recommends that local authorities take the reins, he sees more of a role for central government, which has the financial muscle to buy struggling units and turn them into something vibrant, later selling them on. ""Having that control of the building rather than it being passed off to a group of investors that aren't linked to the place is probably a thing the government can do,"" he says. ""This grave situation presents an opportunity to take control of these things. There's an opportunity to get a good deal, do something with them and then sell them down the line."" Mark Robinson, who co-founded landlord Ellandi and heads the government-commissioned High Streets Task Force, also points to ""monoculture"" in town centres as something that must change. Ellandi owns 33 shopping centres around the UK. ""Landlords I know realise we have to be flexible, encourage vibrancy, not just the highest rent,"" he says. ""We need to be flexible about who we bring in and the terms. We are not going to get 20-year leases any more."" It will mean, at least in the short term, some pain for landlords' bottom line, Mr Robinson says. ""Rents are going to fall and they have fallen considerably. Might that encourage more entrepreneurialism? Yes. Might it encourage independent retailers in far more prominent locations? Absolutely. Does it mean taking risks? Absolutely. And this has to be good for the future."" He says that reform will be over when the presence or absence of a particular brand or shop on the High Street is no longer the measure for a town's success. ""We created 400 clone towns nobody loves. We shouldn't get upset - job losses aside - about changing them.""

"This video can not be played Ewe-nique auction inspired by footballer Marcus Rashford A ""donate-a-sheep"" appeal inspired by the work of footballer Marcus Rashford has been launched. Farmers will sell a lamb or ewe and donate the profits to help families in difficult circumstances due to the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdowns. Farmer Iwan Pughe Jones set up the appeal to help people struggling with health issues and losing work. He was inspired byRashford's bid to ensure children in England receive free school meals during the holidays. He pitched the idea to raise money at a Farmers' Union of Wales (FUW) Zoom meeting and livestock sales, auctions and cattle markets agreed to help. Wales faces a 'rising tide of poverty' after Covid 'No help' for single parents as children isolate Coronavirus 'devastated' poorest communities Long-term unemployment could be 'similar to 1990s' Mr Pughe Jones said: ''Farmers in the meeting were moved when they heard of the hardship. ""Families were having to make difficult choices of turning off heating and electricity to the point that they had to justify turning the oven on to cook food for their families for a certain period of time, as they did not have the money to cover the cost, let alone offer their loved ones presents for Christmas day. ""I was inspired by the effort of Marcus Rashford. What he achieved set a benchmark for us all to aspire to."" Iwan Pughe Jones felt inspired by Marcus Rashford to do his bit to help struggling families He added: ""When times are tough we've a proud history of coming together as a nation to support those who are disadvantaged and struggling to make ends meet."" The money raised will be managed by the Salvation Army in Aberystwyth. The sales kick off on 4 December at Dolgellau and then there are further events at Welshpool, Oswestry, Machynlleth and Rhayader.

"The collapse of the Debenhams and Arcadia retail empires is likely to leave large gaps in High Streets and shopping centres up and down the UK. If history is a guide, it may be years until some of these shops reopen, while many never will. It is now more than four years since the closure of BHS, the last large department store chain to be wiped from the High Street. Yet 24% of its stores still lie empty. Those premises that have been put to use have been snapped up by expanding  brands such as Primark, B&M Bargains, H&M and Sports Direct, says Ronald Nyakairu, senior manager at the Local Data Company (LDC) But even among smaller stores which closed their doors amid the slow decline of bricks-and-mortar retailers before coronavirus, many are vacant or have been demolished or converted, according to LDC data. Its analysis suggests that bigger premises, such as those formerly occupied by Toys 'R' Us or House of Fraser, have been harder to re-let. This probably spells a permanent change that landlords and local authorities need to get used to and even seize, says Bill Grimsey, former head of Wickes, Iceland and Focus DIY. He has led three reports into the future of town centres and High Streets. ""You can't rely on retail any more for your town centres and High Streets as the main attraction, because of technology, because of the internet,"" he says. ""You need to reinvent these places for something else because we are social animals and we need to have a place to congregate and it won't be just shops."" He concedes that managers of his generation were ""part of the cohort than cloned every town centre"" with the same shop chains, and that a return to vibrant towns with individual attractions is needed. He envisages a mix of health, education, entertainment, leisure, arts and crafts and green spaces. Some old shops could become housing, he adds. He urges local authorities to take a lead, even through means such as compulsory purchase to stop empty buildings going to waste. ""It's a big change that's needed and that requires local leaders to find the owners and start to recognise that repurposing them is the way forward."" Cities that have suffered less during the High Street recession are those such as Brighton, Manchester and Leeds that have relied less on shops, says Paul Swinney, director of policy and research at the Centre for Cities. These centres have more office space and higher-paid workers, who have then propped up bars, restaurants and shops after work. For department stores in popular areas, there are ways to cope with fewer sales in-store, he says, pointing to John Lewis's application to convert part of itsflagship London store to office space,external. But he cautions that for smaller towns whose custom may be dwindling, that will not be an option, and stronger medicine will be needed. Many BHS stores, like this one in Bolton, remain closed While Mr Grimsey recommends that local authorities take the reins, he sees more of a role for central government, which has the financial muscle to buy struggling units and turn them into something vibrant, later selling them on. ""Having that control of the building rather than it being passed off to a group of investors that aren't linked to the place is probably a thing the government can do,"" he says. ""This grave situation presents an opportunity to take control of these things. There's an opportunity to get a good deal, do something with them and then sell them down the line."" Mark Robinson, who co-founded landlord Ellandi and heads the government-commissioned High Streets Task Force, also points to ""monoculture"" in town centres as something that must change. Ellandi owns 33 shopping centres around the UK. ""Landlords I know realise we have to be flexible, encourage vibrancy, not just the highest rent,"" he says. ""We need to be flexible about who we bring in and the terms. We are not going to get 20-year leases any more."" It will mean, at least in the short term, some pain for landlords' bottom line, Mr Robinson says. ""Rents are going to fall and they have fallen considerably. Might that encourage more entrepreneurialism? Yes. Might it encourage independent retailers in far more prominent locations? Absolutely. Does it mean taking risks? Absolutely. And this has to be good for the future."" He says that reform will be over when the presence or absence of a particular brand or shop on the High Street is no longer the measure for a town's success. ""We created 400 clone towns nobody loves. We shouldn't get upset - job losses aside - about changing them.""

"Victoria Codling, pictured with her husband, has started a petition There are calls for an alternative to school contact groups isolating for 14 days after a classmate tests positive. Some parents say their children have isolated three times in the past three months - and that it is detrimental to their wellbeing. A petition to the Senedd also says working parents are suffering, with employers not always sympathetic if they have to stay home with children. The Welsh Government said it was working hard on testing developments. ""We are sorry to hear about these experiences,"" a Welsh Government spokeswoman said. ""We are learning more about the virus all the time and experts from across the UK regularly review the self-isolation guidance to make sure the length of time is right to stop it being passed on to other people."" Schools generally keep the same bubble or group of children together to reduce the number that has to isolate if a pupil tests positive for coronavirus - but parents say these groups can end up being large. Almost half of Welsh schools report Covid cases 'No help' for single parents as children isolate Close schools early for Christmas, says union Mass Covid testing considered at Wales' schools Kate Bradley, from Newport, said her son in Year 9 had just finished a period of isolation and, after one day back at school, had been told to isolate again. Ms Bradley said: ""He had felt so anxious about going back and now I feel dreadful for telling him it would all be fine, and it wasn't. ""He had one day back, and now it's another two weeks of no sports, no socialising, no going outside."" And her daughter, in Year 7, having dealt with starting secondary school after months off in the first lockdown and missing all the build-up, has already had to isolate twice. ""My son is normally very positive about school and seeing his friends, but even he's reached the point where he's had enough of it hanging over his head. ""I can't praise the school enough, I think they've done absolutely everything that they can, it's a very Covid-secure school - it's the rules [that are the problem]."" Some schools are isolating small numbers of pupils while others have larger bubbles, parents say Children are not able to leave the house at all for 14 days and cannot go out to exercise after potential contact with a positive case, under the current rules. ""We are big rule-followers, and the children just want to keep people safe. We've seen my mum once, outdoors, since August,"" Ms Bradley said. ""But self-isolation is worse than lockdown because at least then you could go out for a walk or a bike ride, but this is just in the house and there is nothing to do, it's like a prison sentence. ""My son noticed how unfit so many children were when he went back to play football after the first lockdown so it's not so much about learning, the home learning our school has offered has been excellent, it's about exercise, social interaction."" Ms Bradley said she did not wish to criticise any school, but she believed there must be a safe alternative. ""I don't think there are many adults who have had to self-isolate in the way these children are, you wouldn't expect any adult to [spend] eight weeks out of the last 12 isolating, so there has to be a safe answer and we owe it to our children to find it."" The author of the petition, Victoria Codling, who also has children at a school in Newport, believed a negative test after five days of isolating could be a solution -as is the case in England for people arriving in the country from abroad. Face coverings outside the classroom are compulsory in secondary schools to try and prevent the spread According to Ms Codling's petition, which has received more than 800 signatures: ""Isolating for 14 days is so detrimental to their mental and physical wellbeing, it is disproportionate to the risk of their exposure to coronavirus in the first place. ""Some children are enduring their third period of isolation in as many months. Children with additional needs or from disadvantaged backgrounds are even more adversely affected. ""Working (non-isolating) parents are suffering with employers not always sympathetic in these tough economic times."" There are also concerns from supporters of the petition over the workload of teachers having to simultaneously teach children in school and those isolating and learning online. Ms Codling told BBC News she had heard of young children staying in their bedrooms with no human contact, having food brought to them. She added that people were terrified of being asked to isolate towards the end of term - meaning they would have to do so over Christmas. ""I dread to think how much school has been missed,"" she said. Ms Codling added that, while some schools were sending home small groups of pupils who have had contact, others were asking entire year groups to self-isolate. ""They can't run, they can't exercise, some are staying in one room of the house having food brought to them when they don't have any symptoms. ""But then their parents and siblings don't have to isolate at all, parents are confused - it is confusing. ""Some children will cope fine with distance-learning and talking to their friends on Zoom but some don't understand the change in their routine and just don't cope - it's their normality, it's not just about education but social and emotional development."" The Welsh Government added: ""Testing technology is developing all the time and we are working hard to make sure that these new developments are available for use as soon as possible in Wales. ""We know the pandemic has had a huge impact on everyone, but especially on children and young people. ""Support is available if people need it - this includes through our CALL mental health helpline and the Young Persons Mental Health Toolkit.""

"Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Sunday morning. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning. People in the UK will receive the Covid-19 vaccine from Tuesdayunder what the NHS says is the largest immunisation scheme in UK history. Frontline health staff, people over the age of 80 and care home workers will be first to get the jab. Fifty hospitals in England have been initially chosen to serve as hubs for giving the vaccine. Health Secretary Matt Hancock described the start of the vaccination scheme as ""a historic moment"". Pubs and restaurants in Wales have had theirfirst full day of trading without being able to serve alcohol. The hospitality sector was also told it must close its doors from 6pm every night, in a bid to curb rising Covid cases before Christmas. The BBC has been speaking to pub and restaurants owners to see how they have been faring. While some fear venues will not recover from the restrictions, others say they've had a boom in daytime table bookings. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will embark on athree-day tour aboard the royal trainto thank community workers and frontline staff for their efforts during the pandemic. The couple will meet care home staff, teachers, pupils and volunteers to ""share their gratitude"". A spokeswoman said they were ""looking forward to shining a spotlight on the incredible work that has been done"". The 1,250 mile-trip is due to run from Sunday to Tuesday and will stop in England, Scotland and Wales. During the first coronavirus lockdown, many people were inspired to grow their own vegetables at home - often in the smallest of spaces. Months on,green-fingered enthusiasts have been telling the BBC how they got on, with mixed results. While some efforts produced bumper crops, others ended up as just snacks for snails. Schoolchildren in London have been bringing festive joy to elderly care home residents by making thempersonalised Christmas cards, with some even delivering their creations personally. One care home worker told the BBC the Christmas cards would ""mean so much"" to the residents and their mental health and wellbeing.

"This video can not be played Donald Trump: ""If I lost, I'd be a very gracious loser"" US President Donald Trump has held his first rally after losing the US presidential election. The event in Georgia comes before key Senate runoff elections there in January, which will decide control of the upper house. Joe Biden is the first Democratic candidate to win the state in a presidential election since 1992. Mr Trump has repeatedly refused to admit his defeat and made numerous unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud. Ahead of the rally he criticised Georgia's Republican governor on Twitter, calling on him to help overturn Joe Biden's election victory in the state. In his speech on Saturday, however, the president seemed to admit his loss, claiming his foreign policy measures could be reversed under the incoming Democratic president-elect. Under the US constitution, Mr Biden will take office on 20 January regardless of whether Mr Trump admits defeat. Why Republicans are fighting in Georgia Mr Biden won the presidential election with 306 votes in the electoral college - the system the US uses to elect a president - to Mr Trump's 232. The college will meet on 14 December to formalise the outcome. Appearing in Valdosta, Georgia, for his first rally since the 3 November vote, Mr Trump again made claims of electoral fraud and attacked Governor Brian Kemp. Mr Trump has alleged throughout the election that the increase in postal ballots had led to widespread fraud, but there has been no evidence of this. In a speech nearly two hours long - nominally to support two Republican Senators campaigning for re-election - President Trump told the cheering crowd that he could still win the election. Repeating his unsubstantiated claims, he said ""they cheated and rigged our presidential election but we'll still win it"", adding that Mr Kemp should ""get a lot tougher"". The crowd - many waving ""Make America Great Again"" posters - chanted ""Stop the steal"" and ""Four more years"". Despite the euphoria of the event, some Republicans are concerned that the president's continuing allegations of fraud will discourage his supporters from voting in the Senate races by falsely convincing them that the system is rigged. Georgia's Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, said on Wednesday that no evidence of widespread fraud had been found to support Mr Trump's claims. An election official in the state, Gabriel Sterling, also a Republican, hasurged the president to tone down his fraud claims, saying they were inciting violent threats. This video can not be played ""This has to stop... someone's gonna get killed"": Mr Sterling calls on President Trump to condemn the threats The rally came after Mr Trump reportedly called Governor Kemp on Saturday morning and asked him to demand an audit of absentee ballot signatures, according to the Washington Post. Mr Kemp - who has no power to order such an audit - turned down the requests, a source told the newspaper. Then on Twitter, the president turned up the pressure on the governor, saying: ""I will easily & quickly win Georgia if Governor @BrianKempGA or the Secretary of State permit a simple signature verification ... Why are these two 'Republicans' saying no?"" Mr Kemp tweeted back that he had ""publicly called for a signature audit three times"", to which Trump responded by calling for a special session of the state legislature. Someone reportedly familiar with the call told CNN that Mr Trump told Mr Kemp to call the special session and convince legislators to pick electors who would support him. How you can be US president without winning most votes Under the US electoral college system, people vote for a president and then state electors - roughly in line with the population of their state - formally give their electoral college votes to a candidate. The state has two separate Senate races under way ahead of runoff elections on 5 January and both have a Republican incumbent squaring off against a Democratic newcomer. Senator David Perdue, 70, will compete against Jon Ossoff, 33, a documentary filmmaker. Senator Kelly Loeffler, 50, is facing off with Reverend Raphael Warnock, 51, a senior pastor at an Atlanta Baptist Church. Republican Senators Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue listened as President Trump addressed the crowd Recent polls show Mr Warnock pulling ahead of Ms Loeffler and the Perdue-Ossoff race in a dead heat. Mr Trump's Republican party currently has a slim majority in the upper chamber, and a victory in the run-offs would allow it to counter the Democratic administration of President-elect Biden. However, if the Democrats win the two remaining seats, they would control half the seats in the Senate - and the vice-president would be able to act as a tie-breaker. The Democrats already control the lower chamber - the House of Representatives. Can Trump still challenge the result?

"This video can not be played George Eustice: ""There is still a deal to be done... the end of last week was quite a setback"" The UK and EU have resumed talks on post-Brexit trade, with a minister telling the BBC there is ""still a deal to be done"" despite time running short. Environment Secretary George Eustice said ""sticking points"" on fishing and business rules remained. UK chief negotiator Lord Frost is taking part in discussions with EU counterpart Michel Barnier in Brussels. EU sourcestold the BBC,externalan agreement on fishing was close but a No 10 source said there had been ""no breakthrough"". The UK government source told the BBC on Sunday evening: ""Nothing new has been achieved on this today."" A senior EU diplomat told the BBC that fishing ""was definitely not the issue the talks are stuck on"". The diplomat added there was still a dispute over what measures there should be to ensure a ""level playing field"" for businesses on both sides and how to enforce agreed standards. Ireland's foreign minister has said it is ""in everybody's interest"" to reach an agreement soon. Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU if a trade deal is not reached and ratified by the end of the year. What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? Brexit: What is a level playing field? Vaccine rollout 'ready' for any Brexit outcome Mr Eustice told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show: ""There's still a deal to be done, but there's no denying that the end of last week was quite a setback."" He added: ""The sticking points remain - quite fundamental ones. We've been clear all along that we can only do an agreement if it respects our sovereignty."" Mr Eustice also said: ""I think we probably are now in the final few days in terms of deciding whether there can be an agreement."" After receiving instructions from their respective corners, the two chief negotiators embarked on what could be one of the final rounds of this increasingly bruising encounter. On Sunday evening, several EU diplomats told the BBC the two sides were close to resolving their disagreements over EU access to UK fishing waters. But a British government source said nothing new had been achieved. If fishing were to be resolved it would still leave competition rules - including future government subsidies - and the policing of a deal as the remaining two hurdles to clear. Each has the potential to derail the process. First thing Monday morning, Michel Barnier will brief ambassadors from the 27 member states. The last time he did so, he was warned by a handful of anxious countries against giving ground to the British at the final moment and France announced it would veto a bad deal. Arriving in Brussels, Lord Frost said: ""We're working very hard to try and get a deal. We're going to see what happens in negotiations today."" Sunday's meeting follows talks between Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Saturday. In a joint statement,externalafterwards they said fishing rights, competition rules and how any deal would be enforced were still causing problems, and that ""no agreement is feasible if these issues are not resolved"". They have agreed to talk again on Monday evening. Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months Talks are on again:The UK and the EU have until 31 December to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes What happens next with Brexit? Speaking to Ireland's Sunday Independent newspaper,Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said:,external""We are more likely to get a deal than not because I think it's in everybody's interest."" He added that reports the EU had hardened its negotiating stance at France's behest were inaccurate. But Mr Eustice said revised demands from the bloc on fishing rights last week meant talks had ""gone backwards"". He added the UK was ""asking for a normal type of trade agreement such as the one [the EU] put together with Canada"" and that this was ""really not too much to ask"". The EU wants this deal. A no-deal scenario would be costly for EU businesses - a nightmare for European fishing communities, largely dependent on access to UK waters. So the German car industry and others must be lobbying EU governments hard to use these two extra days of talks to finally seal the deal, right? Wrong. The UK government isn't the only one briefing that no deal ""is better than a bad deal"". EU countries that do most trade with the UK, like France, the Netherlands and Belgium, say that too. This week they piled the pressure on those representing them in negotiations not to give ""too much"" away. France threatens to use its veto, while Germany speaks softly of red lines and compromise. The tone is different; the message the same. The EU priority is to protect its single market in a deal with the UK. It insists the government must sign up to ""fair competition rules"" and an agreed method to enforce them, before it gets better access to the single market than any other non-EU country not closely aligned to the bloc. During this last-minute negotiating push, EU governments say they're mindful not to sign up to a deal in a panicked rush. If push comes to shove, they say, they prefer the short-term pain of no deal, in order to protect their longer-term interests: not exposing their businesses to what they view as unfair competition in their own single market. But EU fingers are tightly crossed a compromise can still be found. Mr Barnier tweeted after Saturday's statement was published, saying: ""We will see if there is a way forward."" But, even if the two sides agree a deal, there are still obstacles to overcome. Any agreement will need to be turned into legal text and translated into all EU languages, then ratified by the European Parliament. The UK government is likely to introduce legislation implementing parts of any deal reached, which MPs will be able to vote on. For Labour, shadow Cabinet Office minister Rachel Reeves told the Andrew Marr Show the government ""has to deliver"" a deal but her party would ""have to see the content"" before backing or rejecting it. The 27 EU national parliaments could also need to ratify an agreement - depending on the actual contents of the deal. And on Monday, the UK Internal Market Bill will return to the House of Commons. Certain clauses could allow the government to break international law, by overriding elements of the original treaty with the EU for Brexit - the withdrawal agreement. The EU is unhappy with it, as is the House of Lords, which voted to scrap those clauses of the bill. But the government is still backing its measures, which could cause tensions in the trade talks, and it is expected to push them through the Commons on Monday night. The Taxation (Post-Transition Period) Bill - which contains more powers to break the legal requirements of the withdrawal agreement - will also return to the Commons this week.

"President Trump's supporters staged a rally against the election results outside the Georgia State Capitol The presidential election is over, and President-elect Joe Biden will be heading to the White House in January. But in Georgia, there are two more key political battles still under way. All of the so-called battleground states have certified their results for the presidency, but next month, the outcomes of two critical US Senate races will determine the upper chamber's balance of power. Early voting began on Monday in the southern state for these 5 January run-off races that will shape Mr Biden's first term. Here's what you need to know. The Peach State currently has two separate Senate races in progress ahead of its 5 January run-off elections. Under Georgia law, when no candidate receives more than 50% of the vote, the top two candidates compete against each other in a later race, called a run-off. Georgia residents had to register to vote by 7 December, before the state holds three weeks of early voting, beginning on 14 December. In both races, we have a Republican incumbent squaring off against a Democratic newcomer. Senator David Perdue, 70, will compete against Jon Ossoff, 33, a documentary filmmaker. And Senator Kelly Loeffler, 50, is facing off with Reverend Raphael Warnock, 51, a senior pastor at an Atlanta Baptist Church. Recent polls show Mr Warnock pulling ahead of Ms Loeffler and the Perdue-Ossoff race in a dead-heat. Currently, Democrats control the lower chamber, the House of Representatives, and Republicans hold a majority in the upper chamber - 52 to 48. If the Democrats win both seats in January, the Senate would be evenly divided between parties. But this is still a win for Democrats. US vice-presidents have the power to cast tie-breaking votes in the Senate, meaning that with Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris on board, Democrats would effectively control both chambers. That could make all the difference as the Biden administration seeks to work through its agenda. While the presidential election results were full of disappointments for Donald Trump, losing Georgia may have been the unkindest cut. Like Arizona, the state hadn't been carried by a Democrat since 1992. But unlike that desert state, Georgia wasn't considered an electoral battleground until the campaign's final weeks. That, along with the narrowness of the Biden lead in the state, may be why the Trump team has fought so furiously to flip the state to his column - even if it means going to war with local Republicans overseeing the state's election. The president's efforts to cast doubt on the results in Georgia are complicated by the fact that the state's two runoff contests in January will decide control of the US Senate. The more he feuds with his own party in the state, the greater the risk division will lead to Republican defeat. Trump is making Georgia his first presidential visit since the election. The stated purpose is to campaign for the two Republican incumbent senators, but he is sure to continue to call into question the presidential verdict in the state. Reversing the election results has proven to be a futile battle, but it seems the only thing worse for this president than actual defeat is appearing to accept it. Raphael Warnock (left) and Jon Ossoff are the Democratic candidates for Georgia's seats Senators Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue are the names for the Republican Party Jon Ossoff,launched his campaign with an endorsement from Democratic superstar and civil rights champion John Lewis, who died this summer. Before taking the reins of a documentary film company, Insight TWI, he spent five years working for Congressman Hank Johnson, an Atlanta Democrat. He has employed his filmmaking skills on the trail, launching campaign accounts on both Snapchat and TikTok. David Perduehas served as a Georgia senator since 2015. The former Reebok CEO was an early supporter of Donald Trump, and has remained an ally to the president. He is now facing scrutiny over multimillion dollar stock trades in companies whose business falls under his purview on Senate committees. Reverend Raphael Warnockis a pastor at the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, where civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr once preached. Along with Democratic rising star Stacy Abrams, he started the New Georgia Project, a voting rights organisation. The group is now under investigation for allegedly sending ballot applications to non-residents. Kelly Loeffler,the junior Georgia senator, is still a political newcomer. She was named to the US Senate in December 2019 by Governor Brian Kemp after the sitting senator resigned. One of the wealthiest members of the Senate, Ms Loeffler is co-owner of the women's NBA team the Atlanta Dream. The ownership has caused a stir after the league's players called for Ms Loeffler to sell her stake over her vocal opposition to Black Lives Matter. This video can not be played Are US voters being suppressed in Georgia? With the country's gaze now turned to Georgia, tensions have been rising. Hours before early voting kicked off on 14 Decemer, Mr Trump attacked the state's Republican governor in a tweet, again claiming without evidence that fraud in the presidential election would also affect the senate races. Calling Mr Kemp a ""fool"", Mr Trump demanded the governor call a ""Special Session and open up signature verification"". ""Otherwise, could be a bad day for two GREAT Senators on January 5th."" Mr Trump's own justice department has found no proof to back his claims of widespread fraud. Some Republicans are said to be concerned that Mr Trump's unsubstantiated claims will depress his party's turnout in the runoffs, and hurt the Republican incumbents. Election official Gabriel Sterling has said that Mr Trump will bear responsibility for any violence that results from unsubstantiated election fraud theories that he has promoted. This video can not be played ""This has to stop... someone's gonna get killed"": Mr Sterling calls on President Trump to condemn the threats ""It's all gone too far,"" Mr Sterling said, citing intimidation and death threats to poll workers. ""It has to stop!"" There's conflict within parties, too. Mr Perdue and Ms Loeffler last month penned a joined statement calling on Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, to resign, after he defended the state's election process, and named Mr Biden the winner.

"Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen when they met earlier this year It's not over, not yet. The two sides in this complicated and drawn out process have agreed that it is worth trying one last time to find a way through their profound differences. But the statements from the prime minister and the EU chief, Ursula von der Leyen, signal clearly that a trade deal is out of reach right now - spelling out that if no-one budges in the next few days, it's simply not going to happen. UK-EU trade talks to resume over 'critical issues' LIVE: Leaders agree to resume post-Brexit trade talks What's going on with Brexit? A feature of Brexit negotiations has often been the last minute stand off, the political emergency, before suddenly, lo and behold, a deal emerges from the wreckage. By Monday night, that tradition may have been proven again. Yet it seems there is a lot more to be done than ironing out a few last minute glitches. The UK believes that after months of talks, the EU - pushed by some member states - has hardened its stance on the same old stumbling blocks. And that's pushed a deal that was in reach just a few days ago, further away. For both sides, not reaching a deal would be a political failure. The prime minister has warned that it might not come to pass and has tried to assure the public about what would happen if it can't be done. But the UK and the EU have both said on repeated occasions that a deal is what they want - eager to avoid the disruption of leaving the transition period at the end of this year without arrangements in place. And their negotiating teams have worked for months on the mechanics of how the conundrums over our departure from the trading bloc could be resolved. But the two sides are still stuck over the fundamental, political question - who really calls the shots. It was Theresa May who coined the phrase, ""no deal is better than a bad deal"". In the next 48 hours, Boris Johnson and the European Union have to decide if they want to test if she was right.

"The UK and EU have decided to return to the negotiating table to try to agree a post-Brexit trade deal, despite ""significant differences"". UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen made the decision during a phone call on Saturday. A statement said there were three ""critical issues"" to address. Negotiating teams will reconvene in Brussels on Sunday, and the leaders will speak again on Monday evening. In the joint statement from Mr Johnson and Ms Von der Leyen,external, they said fishing rights, competition rules and how any deal is enforced were still causing problems, with the statement adding: ""Both sides underlined that no agreement is feasible if these issues are not resolved."" But the leaders continued: ""Whilst recognising the seriousness of these differences, we agreed that a further effort should be undertaken by our negotiating teams to assess whether they can be resolved."" The BBC's political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, said the next meeting ""feels like a last roll of the dice, rather than ironing out a few last minute glitches"", and the next 48 hours would be ""critical"". LIVE: Leaders agree to resume post-Brexit trade talks What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? Brexit: What is a level playing field? The UK left the EU on 31 January but remains under EU trading rules until the end of the year. The two sides have been holding talks since March in an attempt to secure a deal before this time, which is called the transition period, ends on 31 December. If a deal is not agreed by that point, tariffs - or taxes on goods - could come into force. But the same three sticking points have stopped negotiating teams coming to an agreement, and on Friday, talks came to an end with both sides saying ""significant divergences"" remained. This video can not be played Ursula Von Der Leyen: 'Significant differences remain' in Brexit trade deal In their statement, Mr Johnson and Ms Von der Leyen said they ""welcomed the fact that progress has been achieved in many areas"". But, they added: ""Nevertheless, significant differences remain on three critical issues: level playing field, governance and fisheries. Both sides underlined that no agreement is feasible if these issues are not resolved. ""Whilst recognising the seriousness of these differences, we agreed that a further effort should be undertaken by our negotiating teams to assess whether they can be resolved."" Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are on again:The UK and the EU have until 31 December to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. What happens next with Brexit? The EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, tweeted after the statement was published, saying: ""We will see if there is a way forward."" Ireland's Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Micheal Martin also took to Twitter, welcoming the news that the teams would resume trade talks. He said: ""An agreement is in everyone's best interests. Every effort should be made to reach a deal."" Labour's shadow Cabinet Office minister Rachel Reeves said: ""The British people were promised a deal and, with time running out, we urge both sides to get on with reaching an agreement."" It's not over, not yet. The two sides in this complicated and drawn out process have agreed that it is worth trying one last time to find a way through their profound differences. But the statements from the prime minister and the EU chief, Ursula von der Leyen, signal clearly that a trade deal is out of reach right now - spelling out that if no-one budges in the next few days, it's simply not going to happen. A feature of Brexit negotiations has often been the last minute stand off, the political emergency, before suddenly, lo and behold, a deal emerges from the wreckage. By Monday night, that tradition may have been proven again. Yet it seems there is a lot more to be done than ironing out a few last minute glitches. Read more from Laura here. If an agreement is reached it will need to be turned into legal text and translated into all EU languages, then ratified by the European Parliament. The UK government is likely to introduce legislation implementing parts of any deal reached, which MPs will be able to vote on. And the 27 EU national parliaments could also need to ratify an agreement -  depending on the actual contents of the deal. But before that, there are even more hurdles to overcome. After the talks between the teams on Sunday and the further leaders' call on Monday, the UK Internal Market Bill will return to the Commons. Certain clauses allow the government to override elements of the original treaty with the EU for Brexit - the withdrawal agreement - which, if implemented, would break international law. The EU are unhappy with it, as are the House of Lords, who voted to scrap those clauses of the bill. But the government is still backing its measures, which could cause tensions in the trade talks, and they are expected to push them through on Monday night. Another bill with similar provisions - the Taxation (Post-Transition Period) Bill - will also return to the Commons this week. In addition, EU leaders will be meeting in Brussels on Thursday.

"This video can not be played Fifty hospitals in England have been chosen as hubs for administering the vaccine The coronavirus vaccine is the ""beginning of the end"" of the epidemic in the UK, Prof Stephen Powis has said, as vaccinations begin on Tuesday. But the NHS England medical director warned the distribution of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine would be a ""marathon not a sprint"". It will take ""many months"" to vaccinate everybody who needs it, he said. Frontline health staff, those over 80, and care home workers will be first to get the Covid-19 vaccine. In England, 50 hospitals have been initially chosen to serve as hubs for administering the vaccine. Scotland,Wales, andNorthern Irelandwill also begin their vaccination programmes from hospitals on Tuesday. Prof Powis was speaking outside Croydon University Hospital in south London, which became one of the first hospitals in the UK to take delivery of the vaccine on Sunday. Vaccines were delivered to Croydon University Hospital on Sunday It comes as a further 231 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported in the latest UK government figures, and a further 17,272 cases. Health Secretary Matt Hancock described the start of the vaccination scheme as ""a historic moment"". ""I urge everybody to play their part to suppress this virus and follow the local restrictions to protect the NHS while they carry out this crucial work,"" he said. What are the safety checks for vaccines How will I get a vaccine? NHS staff: 'Vaccine is a game changer' Refrigerated containers holding the vaccine doseshave been arriving in the UK from Belgium, and are being prepared to be moved from secure locations to the hospitals. Prof Powis said despite ""huge complexities"", the first doses would arrive at hospitals on Monday, to be ready to administer from Tuesday. ""As a doctor this is a really exciting moment,"" he said. ""NHS staff around the country at vaccination hubs have been working tirelessly to make sure that we are prepared to commence vaccination on Tuesday."" He added: ""The NHS has a strong record of delivering large scale vaccination programmes - from the flu jab, HPV vaccine and lifesaving MMR jabs."" About 800,000 doses of the vaccine are expected to be available in the UK from next week. So far the government has ordered a total of 40 million doses - enough to vaccinate 20 million people, with two shots each, 21 days apart. With limited quantities initially available, elderly people who are already attending hospital as an outpatient, as well as those who are being discharged home after a hospital stay, will be among the first to receive the jab. Others over the age of 80 will be invited to attend the hospital to receive a jab, and care home providers will be able to book their staff into vaccination clinics. Any appointments not used for these groups will be used for healthcare workers who are at highest risk of serious illness from the virus. Dr June Raine, chief executive of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), said people could have ""real confidence"" in the vaccine, adding: ""The highest standards of scrutiny, of safety and of effectiveness and quality have been met, international standards."" She also said the MHRA would also be ""following up all the safety issues after rollout incredibly carefully. Our job doesn't end when rollout starts."" Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Dr Raine vowedthe vaccine will reach everyone in the UK who needs it - whatever the outcome of post-Brexit trade talks, saying officials were ""fully prepared"". This video can not be played How will the new Pfizer vaccine work? Because the Pfizer vaccine needs to stored and moved carefully each container is being inspected to ensure the vaccine vials have reached the UK in perfect condition. Tracking data covering every box's journey from Belgium is being downloaded to check that the vials have been kept well below freezing. The boxes each contain five packs of 975 doses, and will be split into smaller packs to be distributed around the country and defrosted. The vaccine is made in Belgium and has to be stored at around -70C Although care home residents and staff are top of the priority list agreed by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), they may not get the vaccine first ""for operational reasons"". Prof Anthony Harnden - deputy chair of the JCVI -told the BBC on Fridaysaid the committee would ""closely monitor"" delivery and stressed he still expected care home residents ""to be prioritised"". Mr Hancock said the government was doing everything it could to overcome ""significant challenges"" to ensure care home residents were vaccinated as soon as possible. Speaking to the Sunday Telegraph,external, the health secretary said fast-track approval of the Covid jab meant restrictions might be relaxed before the end of March next year. As well as the challenge of delivering the vaccine, health experts are also conscious that the public needs to be educated and persuaded to support the vaccination programme. A host of famous faces,externalincluding chat show host Sir Michael Parkinson and the singer Lulu, have told the Sunday Mirror that they will take the coronavirus vaccine without hesitation. It follows concerns thatonline misinformation about vaccines could turn some people against being vaccinated. The Mail on Sunday,externalreports that the Queen is expected to receive the vaccine ""within weeks"" before revealing she has had it to boost public take-up of the jab. The paper quotes senior sources who say the 94-year-old monarch and her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, 99, will not get ""preferential treatment"" and will ""wait in line"" during the first wave of jabs reserved for the over-80s and care home residents.

"Joe Anderson has been mayor since 2012 Liverpool mayor Joe Anderson has been released on bail after being arrested by police investigating claims of bribery and witness intimidation. He was held with four other men as part of an investigation into the awarding of building contracts in the city. The Labour Party has suspended Mr Anderson pending the outcome of the case. Merseyside Police said all five people ""have been released on condition bail, pending further inquiries."" Their year-long investigation, Operation Aloft, has focused on a number of property developers. On Friday,Mr Anderson, 62, was arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit bribery and witness intimidation. In a statement, he said he was ""interviewed for six hours"" and that he was ""co-operating fully"" with the police. Mr Anderson said he would be ""talking to my cabinet colleagues over the weekend to ensure the challenges our city faces with the Covid pandemic continue to receive the focus they deserve"". He also said he supported Labour's decision to suspend him while the police inquiry continues. ""I have been bailed to return in one month's time. Given the investigation is continuing, and there are bail conditions, I will not be making any further comments."" Councillor Richard Kemp, leader of the opposition Liberal Democrat group on Liverpool City Council, said that Mr Anderson should follow ""other senior figures in such cases"" and ""step away"" from the council and mayoralty during the legal process. Police said they detained two other men, from Liverpool and Ainsdale, on suspicion of conspiracy to commit bribery and witness intimidation. Two more, aged 25 and 72, were arrested on suspicion of witness intimidation. Liverpool City Council said it was co-operating with Merseyside Police. Father-of-four Mr Anderson, an ex-social worker and former member of the Merchant Navy, joined the Labour Party in 1980. He was elected mayor of Liverpool in 2012, having been on the city's council since 1998.

"The royal couple asked ""doodle boy"" Joe Whale to mark the three-day tour with a drawing The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are embarking on a three-day tour on board the royal train to thank community workers and frontline staff in the UK. Prince William and Catherine will meet care home staff, teachers, pupils and volunteers to hear about the challenges they have faced during the pandemic. A spokeswoman said they were ""looking forward to shining a spotlight on the incredible work that has been done"". The 1,250 mile-journey will include stops in England, Scotland and Wales. The duke and duchess will board the royal train on Sunday, for what is believed to be Catherine's first official journey on board. Prince William has used the train a number of times, including on the day of his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales' funeral, in 1997 - when the prince travelled from London to the princess's ancestral home in Northamptonshire for her burial. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's tour will celebrate community achievements during the pandemic A Kensington Palace spokeswoman said the morale-boosting tour, which ends on Tuesday, would give the royal couple the chance to ""share their gratitude on behalf of the nation"" for all those supporting their local communities ahead of the Christmas holidays. The UK's arts sector, which has been badly hit during the pandemic, will also be celebrated, with a number of festive performances. All visits and official events will be conducted in line with government's coronavirus guidance. At the request of the royal couple, the forthcoming trip has been immortalised in a drawing by schoolboy artist Joe Whale, better known as the ""doodle boy"", who found worldwide fame during lockdown with his YouTube tutorials. Prince Charles's study on the royal train, as pictured in 2010 Queen Victoria was the first monarch to use the royal train, travelling from Slough to Paddington station on 13 June 1842, with Isambard Kingdom Brunel riding on the footplate. In her diary, the 23-year-old queen described the 25-minute journey as ""delightful and so quick"" The present train has nine carriages and came into service for the Queen's Silver Jubilee, in 1977. It includes private carriages for the Queen and the Prince of Wales The train is described as more functional than palatial, with one royal aide suggesting it has bathroom fixtures ""you could find in Homebase or B&Q"" Only three trips - two by the Prince of Wales and one by the Queen - were taken on the royal train in the 2019/2020 financial year, but the total cost was more than Â£63,000. When the Queen toured the UK on the train for her Golden Jubilee in 2002, it cost Â£872,000 In 2000, a royal bodyguard discharged his gun on the train while the Queen was sleeping.

"The White House reception, branded a superspreading event by virus expert Dr Anthony Fauci Coronavirus cases are rising all over the world. But some places, like South Korea and Australia, are doing better than others at keeping infections low. The explanation could lie in the fact that countries are focusing on superspreading events - and using a smart way of doing contact tracing to pinpoint these clusters of cases as they arise. Coronavirus does not spread evenly. Most people who get the virus wonât pass it on to anyone at all. But a small number of people will spread it widely. Scientists estimate as few as 10% of infected people are responsible for 80% of infections. These clusters of cases are known as superspreading events. What makes a superspreading event partly depends on what people are doing, how many are in the room and how close they are, says Prof Dame Anne Johnson, president-elect of the Academy of Medical Sciences. But also ""some people do just excrete more virus,"" she says. This is either down to the stage the disease is at, or because ""some people produce more droplets than others"". Perhaps the most notorious Covid superspreading event was at the White House Rose Garden in October. One person is thought to have infected at least 11 others, including Donald Trump. Contact tracing is about detective work - and there are different ways to do it. If a person tests positive, forward contact tracing means finding all the people they could have passed the virus on to, and asking them to self-isolate. For backwards contact tracing, the aim is to find who gave the virus to the person who tested positive. The theory is that if they have already passed on the virus, they're more likely to have infected other people as well, because of how superspreading works. Then their contacts are found, and asked to self-isolate, too. White House 'hosted Covid superspreader event' Coronavirus super-spreaders: Why are they important? What makes a gathering a âsuperspreaderâ event? If the effort is just on going forward, then ""potentially a lot of cases won't have infected people"", said Dr Adam Kucharski, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. The result is a big part of the outbreak will be missed, he says. But because cases are often linked to superspreading events, going backwards could pick up infections that might otherwise be missed. âModelling we did,externalestimated that looking backwards as well as forwards could prevent two or three times more infections, and hence transmissions, than it would by just looking forward alone.â South Korea and Japan have concentrated on finding superspreading events since the early days of the pandemic. Australia has also adopted a rigorous backwards contact-tracing approach to keep coronavirus cases low. Forward contact tracing is immediate and ""high-yield"", and should be the first priority, says Dr Anthea Katelaris, an Australian field epidemiologist. âBut backwards contact tracing is required if you're aiming for low or no community cases.â The new coronavirus spreads more easily between people in indoor, poorly ventilated environments The approach, she says, has helped to identify coronavirus clusters and stop them from spreading further. She cites a real example of a person who had developed Covid having been to a restaurant. Following up with the restaurant, her team identified another case that had occurred earlier. ""After that, we were able to identify a number of other people who'd been at the restaurant at the same time. Altogether there were more than 10 other cases linked to that restaurant, and so we were able to limit spreading those other chains of transmission.â Backwards contact tracing is being used in the UK to uncover some Covid clusters, for example in meatpacking plants and other workplaces. But the number of current cases makes it more difficult. The effectiveness of contact tracing drops quickly, as soon as there are larger numbers of infections, says Dr Kucharski. But scientists say backwards tracing should be used routinely, especially in areas where infection numbers are lower. âThere is a huge development in the infrastructure that the UK now has, in the ability to do tests, in having a contact-tracing app that can link people to venues. But it's really making sure that that's used as effectively as possible,â says Dr Kucharski. Locating clusters of coronavirus isnât just useful for stopping transmission. Backwards tracing is also essential for identifying the settings, the environments, where superspreading is happening, says Dr Muge Cevik, an infectious-disease specialist at the University of St Andrews. âGenerally, what we're seeing is [clusters] happen in indoor, poorly ventilated environments... nightclubs, pubs, restaurants and family gatherings - birthdays, congregations in churches and weddings.â Understanding this can help inform policy decisions, she says. âThis could give us a much more targeted approach. So we need to concentrate on limiting these large clusters and superspreading events. And we could also, on the other side, open up safer environments for people, such as well-ventilated indoor spaces and outdoor meeting spaces. âWe will need to learn how to live with the virus, and we can't just think about lock down or open up - there is a much more nuanced approach in-between.â Follow Rebecca onTwitter,external White House 'hosted Covid superspreader event' 'Children are not superspreaders' Video, 00:01:34'Children are not superspreaders' What is the k number?
