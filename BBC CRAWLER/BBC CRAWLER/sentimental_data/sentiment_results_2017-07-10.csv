"Ms Morris has been MP for Newton Abbot since 2010 A Conservative MP has been suspended from the party after it emerged she used a racist expression during a public discussion about Brexit. Anne Marie Morris, the MP for Newton Abbot, used the phrase at an event in London to describe the prospect of the UK leaving the EU without a deal. She told the BBC: ""The comment was totally unintentional. I apologise unreservedly for any offence caused."" The Conservative Party later confirmed she had had the whip withdrawn. Announcing the suspension, Theresa May said she was ""shocked"" by the ""completely unacceptable"" language. ""I immediately asked the chief whip to suspend the party whip,"" she said in a statement. ""Language like this has absolutely no place in politics or in today's society."" The BBC understands the prime minister and Conservative Chief Whip Gavin Williamson met to discuss the matter once Mrs May finished her Commons statement on last weekend's G20 summit. According to a recording published on theHuffington Post,externalwebsite, Ms Morris was discussing the impact of Brexit on the UK's financial services industry at an event organised by the Politeia think tank, which was attended by other MPs. Suggesting that just 7% of financial services would be affected by Brexit, she reportedly said: ""Now I am sure there will be many people who will challenge that but my response and my request is look at the detail - it isn't all doom and gloom."" She went on: ""Now we get to the real nigger in the woodpile, which is in two years what happens if there is no deal."" Peer's apology over racist phrase,external Race gaffe politician 'foolish' The phrase originated in the American Deep South in the mid-19th Century and is thought to have referred to slaves having to conceal themselves as they sought to flee north and secure their freedom. It was subsequently used in the 20th Century - including by a number of leading novelists - as a metaphor to describe a hidden fact or problem. The Lib Dems had called on Theresa May to withdraw the whip from Ms Morris, who was first elected to Parliament in 2010 and was subsequently re-elected in 2015 and earlier this year. Leader Tim Farron said he was ""shocked"" and called for her to be suspended from the parliamentary party. ""This disgusting comment belongs in the era of the Jim Crow laws and has no place in our Parliament,"" he said. Labour's Andrew Gwynne said Ms Morris had used ""outrageous and completely unacceptable"" language. Green Party leader Caroline Lucas called on Ms Morris to resign as an MP, telling Sky News: ""There is no place for her in the House of Commons."" She also claimed that other Conservative MPs at the meeting ""apparently did not bat an eyelid"" at Ms Morris's language. ""At the very least, there ought to be a conversation between Theresa May and the others in that room so that they're very clear going forward that if ever that kind of language is heard in the earshot, it has to be condemned immediately,"" Ms Lucas said. Labour MP Chuka Umunna tweeted: ""Speechless, not just at the remark being made but also at the reported lack of a reaction from the Tories there. Utterly appalling."" Politeia's website,externalsaid MPs Sir William Cash, Kwasi Kwarteng and John Redwood also took part, though Mr Kwarteng told the BBC he was not there. The BBC has contacted the other MPs for comment. Ms Morris did face criticism from Tory colleagues, one of whom, Heidi Allen, tweeted: ""I'm afraid an apology is not good enough - we must show zero tolerance for racism. MPs must lead by example."" Fellow Conservative MP Helen Grant tweeted: ""Inconceivable for an MP using that expression to be incognisant of its history, impact and complete unacceptability. So ashamed!"" In 2008, Conservative peer and party spokesmanLord Dixon-Smith apologised,externalfor using the same phrase in the House of Lords, saying that it was not appropriate and that he had ""left his brains behind"". The peer was not dismissed.

"Ms Trump accompanied her father to earlier sessions before sitting in for him later US President Donald Trump and former first daughter Chelsea Clinton have sparred over his decision to seat his daughter at a summit of world leaders. Mr Trump tweeted that his decision to allow his daughter to take his seat at the meeting in Hamburg was ""very standard"". He also said the media would have cheered ""CHELSEA FOR PRES!"" if Hillary Clinton had made the same choice. Chelsea Clinton tweeted back that her parents would never have done so. Ivanka Trump was criticised onlineafter taking her father's seatbetween the British prime minister and the Chinese president at the G20 summit in Germany on Saturday as her father sat for a one-on-one meeting with the Indonesian president. Ivanka Trump: Who is America's first daughter? The US president tweeted on Monday morning: ""I asked Ivanka to hold seat. Very standard. ""Angela M agrees!"" he added, referring to German Chancellor Angela Merkel. In a follow-up tweet he wrote: ""If Chelsea Clinton were asked to hold the seat for her mother, as her mother gave our country away, the Fake News would say CHELSEA FOR PRES!"" Chelsea Clinton, who was 12-years-old when her father Bill Clinton was sworn in as US president, responded to say: ""Good morning Mr President. ""It would never have occurred to my mother or my father to ask me. Were you giving our country away? Hoping not."" Hillary and Chelsea Clinton White House spokesperson Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Mr Trump's tweet was not about attacking the Clintons, but rather ""this was about responding to an outrageous attack against a White House senior adviser"". ""If she didn't have the last name that she has I think that she would be constantly celebrated instead of constantly attacked"" she added, saying that ""I think we should be proud"" of Ms Trump. The younger Clinton has become a frequent social media critic of Mr Trump and his administration's policies ever since her mother's failed 2016 presidential campaign. Last month Mr Trump sent out a series of tweets accusing the Clinton family of having inappropriate ties with Russia. Days later Chelsea Clinton, 37, accused White House chief strategist Steve Bannon of""fat-shaming"" press secretary Sean Spicer. She and Mr Trump's first daughter, Ivanka, have said they are ""very good friends"" despite their family's political rivalry.

"The 4th Viscount St Davids, Rhodri Philipps, is accused of online threats against the anti-Brexit campaigner, Gina Miller Businesswoman Gina Miller has said she felt ""violated"" after an aristocrat wrote a Facebook post offering a bounty for her to be run over. Rhodri Colwyn Philipps, 50, the 4th Viscount St Davids, wrote the message four days after Ms Miller won a Brexit legal challenge against the government in November of last year. Lord St Davids denies three charges of making malicious communications. He told Westminster Magistrates' Court the posts were not ""menacing"". Lord St Davids, of Knightsbridge, London, wrote on the social media site on 7 November 2016: ""Â£5,000 for the first person to 'accidentally' run over this bloody troublesome first generation immigrant."" He described her as a ""boat jumper"" and added: ""If this is what we should expect from immigrants, send them back to their stinking jungles."" Ms Miller, 52, said she felt ""violated"" by his ""shocking"" comments about her. Asked by the prosecution why he had used the term ""immigrant"", Lord St Davids told the court: ""She's not part of the furniture"" adding, ""She's been here less than a generation."" The viscount also posted two messages referring to immigrants as ""monkeys"". In one post, not directed at Ms Miller, he said: ""Please will someone smoke this ghastly insult to this country, why should I pay tax to feed these monkeys?"" Gina Miller attended Westminster Magistrates' Court in London Ms Millerled the successful legal challengewhich, on 3 November, ruled the government had to consult Parliament before formally beginning the Brexit process. Ms Miller - who was born in Guyana - told the court she had been the subject of death threats since her role in the Article 50 case. In a statement read to the court, she said she was ""very scared for the safety of herself and her family"". ""In addition to finding it offensive, racist and hateful, she was extremely concerned that someone would threaten to have her run over for a bounty,"" prosecutor Philip Stott said. ""She took the threat seriously, and it contributed to her employing professional security for her protection."" Lord St Davids, who was defending himself, accepted writing the posts but told the court they were not publicly visible or menacing. ""If you're in the public eye, people are going to say nasty things about you. It's the rough and tumble of public life,"" he said. He insisted he is not racist and told the court: ""I know a number of Muslims who are dear friends. ""My own mother is an immigrant from the very same continent (as Ms Miller).""

"This video can not be played Michael Hayes said he was speaking out to give 'the point of view of a participant' A self-confessed IRA bomb maker who has said he was part of the group responsible for the Birmingham pub bombings has issued an apology. Twenty-one people were killed on 21 November 1974 when bombs exploded in two city centre pubs. Six innocent men were wrongfully convicted. No-one has ever been brought to justice for one of the worst single losses of life in the Troubles. Michael Christopher Hayes said he was sorry innocent people were killed. The 69-year-old, who now lives in south Dublin, refused to say who planted the bombs in the Mulberry Bush and the Tavern in the Town, but said he was speaking out to give ""the point of view of a participant"". Northern Ireland political reaction Reaction to bombings interview Families react: 'He's a coward - simple as that' What were the Birmingham pub bombings? 'Wrong place, wrong time' - the Birmingham Six Pub bomb inquest 'won't name suspects' The bombs had not been intended to kill people, he said, adding that there had been a crucial eight-minute delay before police were warned of the bombs' location. Once he became aware of the death toll from the two bombs, he personally defused a third bomb left on Birmingham's Hagley Road, said Mr Hayes. This video can not be played The Birmingham pub bombings explained Relatives of those killed have rejected the apology as ""gutless and spineless"". An inquest into the bombings has been re-opened following a campaign by victims' families, who feel they have been denied justice and that their loved ones have been forgotten. Victims' relatives have always wanted the names of the suspects to be disclosed at the inquest. But just last week the coroner ruled that suspects' identities would not be discussed- a ruling denounced by the families as a ""whitewash"". West Midlands Police said their investigation remained open and they would respond to ""any new significant information to bring those responsible to justice"". ""An inquest is due to start and we will not be providing any further comment until the proceedings have concluded,"" said a police spokesperson. In 1990, Michael Hayes was named in a landmark Granada TV programme as one of the men who placed the bombs in the two pubs. He said he was arrested and questioned by West Midlands Police about the bombings in 1974, but was released. When asked last week if he planted the bombs, he told BBC News NI: ""No comment. No comment. ""I've been accused of a lot of things, without one shred of forensic evidence, without one statement made, without one witness coming out against me."" He said the bombs were made of gelignite, and were planted by two individuals. Asked if he was one of the two, he replied: ""I'm not telling you."" Twenty-one people died in two explosions in Birmingham in November 1974 However, he said he took what he called ""collective responsibility"" for all the IRA's actions in England - including the Birmingham pub bombings. He said he was in the IRA for more than 30 years in both Ireland and England, adding that he was ""a participant in the IRA's activities in Birmingham"". Ten people were killed in the Mulberry Bush explosion He said: ""We were horrified when we heard because it was not intended. I personally defused the third bomb."" Asked what expertise he had that allowed him to do that, he said: ""Quite a lot. I specialised in explosives. I knew what I was doing."" This video can not be played Birmingham pub bombings: Families fury at IRA 'apology' Michael Hayes said the IRA unit in Birmingham had been shocked by the scale of the death toll. ""It was not the intention of the IRA to kill innocent people,"" he told BBC News NI. ""That wasn't meant. It wouldn't have been done if that was the case."" He said he thought they had given sufficient time for the police to evacuate the buildings. ""We believed that we gave adequate warnings,"" he said. The Birmingham pub bombs injured 182 people ""It was only later on that we realised there was eight valuable minutes missed. We were going to give them a half-hour warning. ""Out of that half hour, eight minutes elapsed - eight priceless minutes."" He said that as he understood it one of the phone boxes used for the telephone warnings was broken and another one was being used. The former IRA man said he was sorry for the hurt caused to the relatives of those killed. The families of the victims have campaigned for legal aid ""My apologies and my heartfelt sympathy to all of you for a terrible tragic loss that you have been put through,"" he said. ""In all these years that you have been trying to find closure, I hope at last God will be merciful and bring you closure. ""I apologise not only for myself, I apologise for all active republicans who had no intention of hurting anybody and sympathise with you."" Julie Hambleton, whose 18-year-old sister Maxine was killed in the explosions, said an apology from the IRA would be offensive. ""He's a coward, as simple as that,"" she told the BBC. ""He'll take collective responsibility for those unarmed, innocent people, but won't say who done it? ""He's gutless and spineless,"" she added. ""He's told us nothing, he's admitted nothing."" The bombs were widely acknowledged to be the work of the IRA Michael Hayes has said he would not be attending the inquest into the bombings. ""I would not go along to it. Why should I? What reason would I have to go there? I am just kind of giving this interview. ""That is sufficient. I'm not going back to England."" Meanwhile, the former IRA man insists he has a clear conscience. ""Very much so,"" he said. ""I can sleep at night. Because I am not a murderer."" This video can not be played A couple caught up in the Birmingham pub bombings relive horror He said he would rather die than become an informer by naming the real bombers to help free the Birmingham Six, who served 16 years in prison before their sentences were quashed by the Court of Appeal in 1991.

"Andronicos Sideras allegedly mixed up the meats before sale A plot to pass horsemeat off as beef fell apart after horse identification chips were found in the meat by inspectors, a court has been told. Andronicos Sideras, 54, has been accused of deliberately mixing up the meats before they were sold in 2012. Mr Sideras was one of the owners of meat company and sausage manufacturer Dinos & Sons. The businessman, from Southgate, north London, denies conspiracy to defraud between 1 January and 30 November 2012. Prosecutor Jonathan Polnay said alarm bells were raised after Dinos ""messed things up"" when assembling an order. A surprise inspection was triggered when the wrong size of shipment was sent to a company called Rangeland in Newry, Northern Ireland, in 2012, Inner London Crown Court was told. The 12-pallet load was analysed and four of them contained horse. Mr Polnay said: ""Some of them were found to contain significant amounts of horsemeat; roughly about a third contained horse."" It is alleged Mr Sideras mixed meat in this way before it was sold on to manufacturers making products for ""a vast range of well-known companies"". Mr Sideras's fingerprints were found on ""fake"" labels, the court heard. Mr Polnay added: ""The final piece of the jigsaw is that when the meat was analysed, three horse ID chips were found in some of it."" The chips were roughly the size of a 1cm grain of rice - two of which were Polish and one Irish. It is alleged Danish-owned company Flexi Foods would buy horsemeat and beef from suppliers across Europe and then deliver to Dinos & Sons in Tottenham, north London. Mr Polnay said the fraud could not have worked or taken place without the ""connivance"" of Mr Sideras. He said: ""The meticulous records kept by FlexiFoods caused their undoing. They also provide compelling evidence of the guilt of this defendant."" He told the court that two men, Ulrik Nielsen, 58, the owner of FlexiFoods, and his ""right-hand man"", Alex Beech, 44, have already pleaded guilty to the same charge. The trial continues.

"Rory Cowan started off as Brendan O'Carroll's publicist Rory Cowan, who plays Mrs Brown's hairdresser son Rory in hit sitcom Mrs Brown's Boys, has left the programme. Cowan said he had been ""unhappy"", and left his co-stars after a Mrs Brown show at London's O2 Arena on Sunday. He has worked with the comedy's creator Brendan O'Carroll for 26 years. ""I hadn't been happy working for the Mrs Brown's Boys company for the last 18 months to two years,"" he said. ""I feel that 26 years is enough so I decided it was time to go."" Cowan told O'Carroll last month that he wanted to quit, but was persuaded to stay for the latest part of the Mrs Brown tour. ""I told Brendan on 16 June about my decision to leave,"" Cowan told the Irish Daily Mail. ""That's when I handed in my notice. Cowan and his co-stars have been on a sold out UK arena tour ""I was supposed to leave at the end of that week, but Brendan said that would be impossible and asked if I'd stay on until the end of the London O2 gigs. So I agreed to that."" He said there was ""no bad blood"" between the pair. ""I'm not going into details about why I was unhappy. I did the final show, packed my stuff into a small Waitrose plastic bag and just left the venue."" In a statement, O'Carroll described Cowan as ""a legend"". ""To all of us it feels like Ronaldo leaving Manchester United,"" he said. ""But Ronaldo went on to amazing success which I know Rory will too. ""I can't even quantify the contribution Rory has made to our success and the well-being of me and my family, not just on screen or stage but way before that as a friend and a driving force in getting us here."" Cowan started off as O'Carroll's publicist - a job he took after being made redundant as a marketing manager for EMI Records.

"This video can not be played Colorado teenage camper wakes up in bear's jaws A Colorado teenager has described awaking to find his head clamped in the jaws of a bear that was dragging him away from his campsite. The 19-year-old, a survival instructor at Glacier View Ranch summer camp, felt ""immense pain"" as he heard the beast's teeth ""crunching"" on his skull. The black bear dragged the boy for more than 10ft (3m) before being scared away by other campers early on Sunday. Officials say the animal remains a threat and are currently hunting it. ""There's four spots where its claws dug into me,"" he told KTVB-TV, while gesturing to the teeth marks on the back of his head from the animal, which is estimated to weigh 400lb (181kg). American black bears generally avoid confrontations with humans ""And then it pulled me into its mouth and then it grabbed me with its teeth right back here. ""And when it pulled it tore the skin and scraped along my skull which was like the cracking noise that I heard."" He added: ""The crunching noise, I guess, was the teeth scraping against the skull as it dug in."" Dylan said he could feel the bear's breath on the back of his neck. He had been sleeping outside in a teepee alongside four other camp counsellors when the attack occurred around 04:15 local time (11:15 GMT) in Ward - about 20 miles (32km) from Boulder, Colorado. ""I thought I was dreaming for a second and then I thought this hurts too bad to be dreaming,"" he continued. He fought back against the bear, striking it the face and poking its eyes, before it let him go. He was taken to hospital with minor injuries, and came away with just nine stitches.

"The parents of Charlie Gard appear in many of the newspapers Several papers report the warning from a pay review body that schools in England are struggling to recruit teachers, after the government decided to cap their pay rises at 1%. The story makes the lead in theDaily Telegraph,external, which says the prime minister is likely to face more challenges from her own MPs on the issue. The paper says the pay review body's warning will add to mounting pressure on Chancellor Philip Hammond to ease the pay cap in his Budget later this year. TheGuardian,externalsays Mrs May has been accused of insulting teachers. It also believes pressure is building on the government to announce a review of public sector pay in the autumn Budget. In other education news, ministers are considering scrapping the Conservative programme tobuild hundreds more free schools,external, as they struggle to fund a manifesto promise to boost education budgets by Â£4bn, according to the Times. The paper also reports the decision to continue the 1% cap on pay rises for teachers, calling it another real-terms salary cut for half a million staff in England and Wales. The grim-facedparents of Charlie Gard,externalare pictured on the Daily Mirror's front page, after a hearing at the High Court on Monday. The Times,externalreports how they shouted at the judge and a lawyer as they were told to provide fresh evidence that their terminally-ill baby should be taken abroad for treatment. TheDaily Mail,externalsays that after the hearing, many were left pondering the same simple clash of arguments. It was the  medical establishment versus a family not prepared to admit defeat, as long as someone, somewhere, was saying that something might be done. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external The main story in theFinancial Times,externalis that the drugs industry is going to court to try to stop the NHS imposing new limits on the price it will pay for medicines. The FT says the industry has complained that the policy might prevent patients from securing cutting-edge medicines for the most serious diseases. The paper says the rules also affect drugs for very rare illnesses, which often affect children, and will be subject to a cost limit for the first time. The Guardian's front page, meanwhile, highlights a warning from scientists that thesixth mass extinction of species in the earth's history is well under way,external. The paper says the new study analysed both common and rare species and found that billions of regional or local populations had been lost, mainly because of human overpopulation and over-consumption. Animals affected include lions in South Africa, Guatemalan bearded lizards, as well as red squirrels and barn swallows. A front-page report in theFinancial Times,externalsays the government has conceded that the European Court of Justice could continue to have sway over Britain for a limited time after Brexit. The paper sees the move as a ""blurring"" of one of Prime Minister Theresa May's red lines over negotiations with the EU, and says it could pave the way for a softer Brexit. The FT calls it the most consequential concession since the referendum. Mrs May's call for a cross-party approach to tacking the challenges facing the UK is given short shrift inthe Telegraph,external. The paper says that instead of prompting a great coming together, the idea seems to be falling apart almost immediately. The Conservatives sometimes appear to have lost their bearings, the paper says, and the prime minister will not find the right path by following Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Butthe Sun,externalbelieves it was honest and brave of Mrs May to offer other parties a say. What it calls Jeremy Corbyn's ""graceless"" rebuff was predictable, it says. Amid all the Wimbledon coverage, theTelegraph,externalhighlights complaints of sexism in the tournament's scheduling. It says critics have pointed out that the show courts at the All England Club are routinely hosting two men's games, but only one women's match, each day. It says Andy Murray has entered the fray, urging Wimbledon to begin play earlier on Centre Court to allow four matches and an equal split. And finally, there is widespread coverage of two new studies, which conclude that drinking coffee can reduce the risk of dying early. The findings makethe lead in the Daily Express,external, which says three cups a day can cut the risk of cancer, heart disease and strokes. The Times,externaladds that while coffee has been blamed for health problems such as insomnia, heartburn and weak bones, the new findings appear to show that the benefits outweigh the risks.

"Charlie Gard has been in intensive care since October A lawyer for Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) has dismissed claims of ""fresh"" medical evidence in the case of terminally ill baby Charlie Gard. GOSH referred the case back to the High Court after reports of ""new"" data from foreign healthcare experts suggested treatment could improve his condition. Charlie's parents have made several unsuccessful challenges to a decision to end the 11-month-old's life support. GOSH told the hearing the evidence was not new but it was right to explore it. Mr Justice Francis is overseeing the preliminary hearing in the Family Division of the High Court. In April he ruled that Charlie's life support should be ended and said earlier it would take something ""dramatic and new"" to make him change his mind. Mr Justice Francis is due to resume hearing the case on Thursday. On Sunday, Charlie's parents Chris Gard and Connie Yateshanded in a 350,000-signature petitioncalling for him to travel to the US for treatment. Charlie's parents are seeking permission to remove their son - who has the rare condition mitochondrial depletion syndrome - from the care of Great Ormond Street Hospital so he can undergo experimental treatment abroad. Charlie's medical case explained The judge said: ""There is not a person alive who would not want to save Charlie."" A lawyer for the family said new and unpublished data was recently shared with the hospital that suggested treatment could produce a ""dramatic clinical improvement"" in Charlie's condition. Previously doctors had indicated Charlie had irreversible structural brain damage. Lawyers representing the family have now said using ""cutting edge genetic science"" there was a ""small chance"" of brain recovery and that it was a chance ""worth taking"". They questioned whether Mr Justice Francis was the correct person to assess the latest medical evidence, given that in April he had ruled Charlie's life support should be withdrawn. In reply, the judge said: ""I did my job.  I will continue to do my job."" At the hearing, a lawyer for GOSH said the alleged ""new research"" had been available for the judge's consideration in April and was purely lab-based anyway, and related to patients with muscle problems only rather than brain damage. Charlie inherited the faulty RRM2B gene, affecting the cells responsible for energy production and respiration and leaving him unable to move or breathe without a ventilator. GOSH describes proposed experimental therapies as ""unjustified"" and said the treatments being offered are not a cure. However, the hospital's decision to go back to court came after researchers at two international healthcare facilities said they had ""fresh evidence about their proposed experimental treatment"". Charlie's parents, from Bedfont in west London, want their son to have nucleoside therapy. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Ms Yates described the situation as a ""living hell"". ""I couldn't sit there and watch him in pain and suffering, I promise you I wouldn't,"" she said, adding: ""I think parents know when their children are ready to go and they've given up, and Charlie is still fighting. ""It's horrible that this decision has been taken out of our hands. It's not just about us knowing best, it's about having other hospitals and doctors saying we want to treat [Charlie] and we think it's the best thing to do."" Ms Yates said they were not criticising Great Ormond Street Hospital as ""they do great things"". She said she hoped the judge would take into account new evidence as when the decision was made previously, Charlie's chance was rated at being close to 0% but now this has increased to 10%. Charlie is thought to be one of 16 children in the world to have mitochondrial depletion syndrome. It is a rare genetic condition which causes progressive muscle weakness and brain damage because he is unable to get energy to his organs. Doctors have said he now cannot see, hear, move, cry or swallow and has irreversible brain damage. His lungs are only able to keep going because of the treatment he is receiving. They have argued he should be allowed to die with dignity. But his parents and supporters have been fighting for him to be given an experimental treatment in the US. The treatment is not a cure - there isn't one - but it has been suggested it could reduce the effects of the disease. Although doctors in the US have since said the benefits they have seen have not been in cases as advanced as Charlie's. Charlie's parents have launched a high-profile campaign in the hope of getting their son further treatment abroad US President Donald Trump and the Vatican have supported the parents' campaign for Charlie to be treated abroad, but a leading expert has described interventions from high-profile figures as ""unhelpful"". Prof Neena Modi, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said in an open letter that Charlie's situation was ""heartbreaking"" for his parents, but added that even well-meaning interventions from outsiders could be unhelpful. Mr Gard said: ""If we won the court case and we got to America, and then within the first week of treatment he started suffering and he was in pain, we would let him go. ""This isn't about us. This is about Charlie and giving him the chance he needs."" 3 March 2017: Mr Justice Francis starts to analyse the case at a hearing in the Family Division of the High Court in London 11 April: He says doctors can stop providing life-support treatment 3 May: Charlie's parents ask Court of Appeal judges to consider the case 23 May: Three Court of Appeal judges analyse the case 25 May: Court of Appeal judges dismiss the couple's appeal 8 June: Charlie's parents lose fight in the Supreme Court 20 June: Judges in the European Court of Human Rights start to analyse the case after lawyers representing Charlie's parents make written submissions 27 June: Judges in the European Court of Human Rights refuse to intervene 3 July: The Pope and US President Donald Trump offer to intervene 7 July: Great Ormond Street Hospital applies for a fresh hearing at the High Court Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external Charlie Gard's parents make hospital plea Fresh court bid in Charlie Gard case 'Impossible' to transfer Charlie Gard Pope and Trump offer Charlie Gard support HM Courts Service Great Ormond Street Hospital Walworth Town Hall shows off majestic transformation as it reopens 11 years after horrific fire Lloydâs of London chief executive John Neal to leave for Aon Sadiq Khan's deputy could overturn refusal of 46-storey student tower The World Club returns with the Revive-all repair workshop in Kingston for 2025 Ramraiders steal designer sunglasses worth Â£10k from Hampstead optician The Traitors: How you can get Claudia Winkleman's iconic look on a budget At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles Watch: Ferocious and explosive fire burns behind CBS reporter Liam Payne cause of death confirmed as UK inquest opens Where is Greenland and why does Trump want it?

"This video can not be played Theresa May said it was important to have a ""flexible"" approach that didn't ""exploit workers"" All work in the UK's economy should be ""fair and decent"", a government review of employment practices has said. The report,externalby former aide to Tony Blair, Matthew Taylor, pays particular attention to the gig economy. It recommends that workers for firms such as Uber and Deliveroo should be classified as dependent contractors, with extra benefits. The Prime Minister said the government would take the report's recommendations seriously. Mr Taylor said there was a perception that the gig economy put too much power into the hand of employers: ""Of all the issues that were raised with us as we went around the country, the one that came through most strongly was what the report calls one-sided flexibility. At-a-glance: The Taylor review Viewpoints: Paying in cash What is the gig economy? National Insurance hit for gig economy firms ""One-sided flexibility is where employers seek to transfer all risk onto the shoulder of workers in ways that make people more insecure and makes their lives harder to manage.  It's the people told to be ready for work or travelling to work, only to be told none is available."" â¢ People who work for platform-based companies, such as Deliveroo and Uber, be classed as dependent contractors â¢ Strategies must be put in place to make sure that workers do not get stuck on the National Living Wage â¢ The review suggests a national strategy to provide good work for all ""for which government needs to be held accountable"" â¢ The government should avoid further increasing the the non-wage costs of employing a person, such as the apprenticeship levy A spokesperson for the meal delivery service Deliveroo, one of the companies at the heart of the gig-economy debate, said: ""We would welcome the opportunity to work with the government so we can end this trade off between flexibility and security."" Mr Taylor's report did not attack the gig economy. It said that flexibility in the workplace was important and had contributed to record high employment. He pointed to the official Labour Force Survey of March this year, which found that 68% of those on zero hours contracts did not want more hours. However, he said too many employers and businesses were relying on zero hours, short-hours or agency contracts, when they could be more forward thinking in their scheduling. This video can not be played Matthew Taylor: gig economy firms should pay national insurance on workers Earlier, Mr Taylor had told the BBC: ""There are too many people at work who are treated like cogs in a machine rather than being human beings, and there are too many people who don't see a route from their current job to progress and earn more and do better."" But he said working platform providers such as Uber had to demonstrate that workers signing on for hours of work would ""easily clear"" the minimum wage. Andrew Byrne, head of policy at Uber, said that the average driver took well over the National Living Wage. He also said Uber ""would welcome greater clarity in the law over different types of employment status"". Mr Taylor also suggested that cash payments should be phased-out. He said cash jobs such as window cleaning and decorating were worth up to Â£6bn a year and many were untaxed - something Mr Taylor says should be addressed. Mr Taylor said he did not want to ban cash payments outright, but hoped, over time, the increasing popularity of transaction platforms such as PayPal and Worldpay would see a shift from cash-in-hand work. ""In a few years time as we move to a more cashless economy, self employed people would be paid cashlessly  - like your window cleaner. At the same time they can pay taxes and save for their pension,"" he said. ""Most people who do pay for self-employed labour would like to know that that person is paying their taxes."" However, Labour's shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey said the review did not go far enough for the 4.5 million people in insecure work. She told the BBC: ""If it looks like a job or it smells like a job then it is a job, and the worker should be employed, and I think in those situations where a worker is carrying out work on behalf of an employer... they should not be exploited as a flexible workers."" Trade unions also said Mr Taylor had not tackled many of the issues facing workers. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: ""From what we've seen, this review is not the game-changer needed to end insecurity and exploitation at work.""

"Jonathan Teo co-founded Binary Capital in 2014. The co-founder of a Silicon Valley investment firm said it is ""not my job to make you all feel good"" in a long email to staff and investors. Jonathan Teo from Binary Capital was responding to negative press coverage about the firm following allegations of sexual harassment by his co-founder Justin Caldbeck. He added that he was ""tired and indignant"", and raged against ""whiners"" who demanded his attention. Mr Teo has already offered to resign. He did so after Mr Caldbeck left the firm in June. ""I'm incredibly sorry,""Mr Caldbeck tweeted,externalwhen the news broke last month. Mr Caldbeck's actions were one of several sexism scandals to rock Silicon Valley in recent months. They include a damning report into the work culture inside ride-hailing firm Uber, and the resignation of venture capitalist Dave McClure, who admitted ""inexcusable behaviour"" towards ""multiple women"". Justin Caldbeck said he was ""incredibly sorry"" over harassment claims No allegations have been made against Jonathan Teo, who said he had offered to step down in order to ""quell a news cycle"". He blamed leaks to a ""corrupted"" media about investors feeling nervous about his firm and claimed his resignation offer had not yet been accepted. Mr Teo also said he was ""angry that women had felt hurt"", but described a suggestion by one of the firm's portfolio companies that the next partner should be a woman as ""moronic"". ""We must choose the best person, male or female,"" he wrote in the email, which the BBC has confirmed to be genuine. ""Talent is universal if we only choose to recognize it. Anything else is again grandstanding for a personal agenda."" Mr Teo also added that reports suggesting investors were trying to buy back shares were untrue, and said that it was ""dishonourable"" for an entrepreneur to back away ""at the first sign of trouble"". Onlyone firm,externalhas so far announced its intention to pull away from Binary Capital. Silicon Valley is full of ""entitled human beings"", Mr Teo continued. ""As for the people here that whine that they aren't taken care of, who have not to worry about their lives being taken from them or their basic needs met, who owes them more than the voice they already have access to?"" he wrote. I'm a creep, says resigning tech boss A plea for 'decency' in shaken Silicon Valley The email was first published by the websiteAxios,external. Journalist Erin Griffith described the email as ""unapologetic"" on theFortune website,external. ""It is angry and, in parts, barely coherent,"" she said. Silicon Valley entrepreneur and journalist Mike Malone said the email was ""a Jerry Maguire moment"" for Mr Teo. ""He's having a very bad day,"" he said. ""He says he'll resign, then turns around and says it's not his fault at all, that everyone is conspiring against him including the media. ""If you were teaching PR 101 this guy has just done everything possible wrong. He has insulted clients, he has insulted investors, he has insulted employees and he has insulted the media. ""This is a venture capital fund and venture capitalists live and die by the amount of money they can raise for their next fund."" Jonathan Teo told the BBC he didn't want to comment at this time.

"These text messages were sent on 3 June A watchdog has revealed it is investigating a premium-rate texting campaign, following complaints from recipients that they have been charged fees even though many believe they never opted into the service. One expert claimed the messages look like spam, which could cause phone owners to ignore them. There is also concern about conflicting advice being given to the public. The two companies involved in the campaign deny any wrongdoing. The BBC became aware of the campaign when one of its reporters received a text in June. It said: ""FreeMsg: U have subscribed to Comp House competition for Â£4.50 per month until you send stop to 82225. SP Pro Money HELLO? 08001577502?T&C"". A shortened Bit.ly link was sent as a follow-up message, and a third communication stated that this ""text cost Â£1.50"". The company behind the campaign is called Pro Money Holdings, whichis registered to an Ilford, London address,external. It makes use of a second service, called Veoo - a St Albans-headquartered business that provides billing and messaging platforms to mobile-related companies. The industry's regulator, the Phone-paid Services Authority (PSA), later told the BBC it was ""informally"" investigating complaints about the Pro Money Holdings service and had ""recently"" opened a probe into Veoo. ""Under our code of practice, consumers must not be charged for phone-paid services without their consent,"" said a spokesman. ""We are currently looking into complaints regarding the service operating on 82225 and separately have an ongoing investigation into Veoo."" Members of the public haveposted concerns about the 82225's operation,externalover the past two months, with several saying theycould not recall subscribing,externalto anything that would account for the fees. But Pro Money Holdings told the BBC it only charged people who had ""pushed a key"" in an online competition or in response to a phone message. ""There's a lot of compliance that goes into everything that's done with anything we do,"" customer care manager David Marshall said. ""Prior to anything starting, there's a lot of testing done to make sure that everything from our end is correct. ""From our own perspective, if there's something not 100% at our end, we would get it adjusted."" UK tourists hit by booking scams Onecom fined for 'millions' of spam texts Guardian Soulmates users hit with explicit spam To prove the point, Mr Marshall offered to provide details about how the BBC journalist came to be subscribed. But more than a month after making the promise, Pro Money Holdings has not shared the details, despite repeated follow-up requests, beyond saying the journalist had opted in and this had been ""verified by an independent third party"". It did, however, refund the Â£1.50 fee that had been charged. For its part, Veoo said it was no longer supporting the campaign. ""Following on-going compliance checks with the service... run by Pro Money Holdings, Veoo suspended the Pro Comp service and will not be reinstating that service via our messaging platform,"" said spokeswoman Vanessa D'Souza. ""We take our responsibilities very seriously."" One cyber-security consultant said he had concerns that the messages could be mistaken as spam, in part because of their odd punctuation and use of ""u"" rather than ""you"". ""It's exactly the sort of message that you might delete assuming it's spam only to realise, perhaps months later when checking your bill, that you've been paying,"" said Alan Woodward. Phone owners are given conflicting advice about how to deal with Stop-type texts Mobile owners seeking advice about how to handle such demands are given contradictory advice online. The PSA states that users should reply to rather than ignore Stop messages. But the popular Money Saving Expert site, among others, says not to do so if the texts look suspicious. ""The golden rule is do not reply, at all, ever - do not text 'Stop'!""it states,external. ""These texts want any response to confirm you are a real person. ""Any numbers that are confirmed are likely to be sold on to... unscrupulous marketeers who may further spam you with unsolicited calls and texts. ""Ensure you don't click on any links within the text either."" For its part, Pro Money Holdings denies deliberately designing its texts to look odd and defended its use of ""slang"". ""The size of an SMS is a maximum of 160 characters as you are aware,"" it told the BBC. ""In order to fit the customer care telephone number on the message, it is necessary to shorten some words where applicable."" Mobile networks say customers who receive unsolicited texts can contact their support teams to confirm whether the messages are legitimate and if a Stop response should be sent. ""I have seen people ignoring these messages and being charged a lot,"" said one Vodafone call centre employee. ""Blocking doesn't stop these as customers are charged irrespective of whether they receive these messages or not, even if the phone is off."" The PSA said it could not comment further about Pro Money Holding's case. But Mr Woodward urged it to review its guidance. ""If the regulator is expecting us to reply, 'Stop', there is a danger that it causes those heeding such advice to play into the hands of scammers,"" he said. ""Either way, the regulator is the one who needs to 'stop' this, not unsuspecting recipients.""

"This video can not be played Camden Lock fire eyewitness: ""I could see flames"" Dozens of stall-holders have lost their entire stock after a blaze ripped through Camden Lock Market in north London overnight. About 30 stalls were based in the Market Hall, where the fire began, while other local businesses had goods stored inside the destroyed building. One market owner said he believed about 100 traders had been affected and some would be ""finished"" as a result. About 70 firefighters tackled the blaze at the popular tourist attraction. Market is 'our heart and soul' Major fires have hit the sprawling market area twice before in recent years, withone in 2008,externalleading to part of the site being shut down for over a year. The market, which has been based in the area since 1974, boasts more than 1,000stalls and shops. No-one was injured in the fire Market worker Kareem Khodeir said he believed about 100 traders had been affected, while 30 who had permanent stalls in the building ""have completely lost everything"". ""It most likely will destroy a few businesses completely,"" he said. Deicola and Leora Neves, who own Camden Guitars, which is based in the damaged building, said their shop had been destroyed and ""everything has gone"". ""This is where we started and we're really feeling the loss of that,"" Ms Neves said. Firefighters contained the blaze to one building Much of the market was not affected by the blaze Open-air trader Laetitia Dupont said the lamps she sells in the market, which she stored in the burnt building, had all been destroyed. ""Even if the fire didn't touch it, the water has,"" she said. Camden fire: 'It's our heart and soul' Ms Dupont, who does not have insurance, added she was unsure what would happen to her business.

"South Devon Railway has apologised to the family A small boy almost fell from a moving train carriage on to the track below because the toilet floor was missing. His mother was able to catch him before he fell when she took him to the toilet on the Totnes Riverside to Buckfastleigh train in Devon. Investigators said the floor had been removed for repairs to the carriage's brakes but had not been replaced. South Devon Railway (SDR), which runs the steam train, said it is taking the investigation ""extremely seriously"". More on the missing train floor and other Devon news The Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) said the 13:00 BST train was running between Staverton and Buckfastleigh on the South Devon Railway when the mother took her child to the toilet in the fourth carriage on 22 June. The train was travelling at about 20mph (32 km/h) when they opened the door and saw the floor of the compartment was missing, exposing the carriage wheels below. She reported the matter to the train guard and the door was locked. The carriage understood to contain the missing floor The mother and child were left shocked and the boy suffered minor bruising. Staff had previously placed a notice on the door and tried to secure it to prevent it being opened, but those measures were not effective, the RAIB said. Its investigation, which will look at the repairs to the carriage, the adequacy of the measures to secure the door and the railway's systems for assuring the safety of rolling stock in service, will be published in due course. The South Devon Railway has been open for 50 years An investigation has also been launched by the Office of Rail and Road (ORR). A registered charity, SDR is a seven-mile former Great Western Railway branch line which runs steam trains and heritage rolling stock as a tourist attraction. In a statement, SDR apologised and said: ""On the day in question, something clearly went wrong with our safety control and hazard monitoring systems as evidenced by the incident having taken place - it simply should not have happened.""

"Teachers have faced a pay cap for seven years - with pay falling behind inflation Teachers' pay in England and Wales will have to stay within austerity pay limits - with another year of increases restricted to 1%. It will mean another real-terms pay cut for more than 500,000 teachers in England and Wales. The pay review body - which was obliged to keep pay rises to 1% - has expressed its concern. The cap on pay, initially of 0% and then 1%, has been in place since 2010, as part of austerity measures. The National Union of Teachers says that successive years of below-inflation pay deals has seen teachers' pay fall in real terms by 13%. Head teachers' leader Geoff Barton accused ministers of ""playing fast and loose with children's education"". ""Teachers are facing a seventh year of real-terms pay cuts at a time when we are in a full-blown recruitment crisis,"" said Mr Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union. The Department for Education said that it was striking a balance between being fair to teachers and to taxpayers. The decision over teachers' pay will be seen as sending a signal over pay for more than five million public sector workers. In the wake of the general election, there were reports of debates within the Cabinet about whether to ease the constraints on public sector pay and try to reverse wage stagnation. No 10 sticks to public sector pay policy Heads press MPs for answers on school funding Teacher shortages getting worse say MPs Reality Check: Is public sector pay higher than private? The School Teachers' Review Body is an independent pay body that provides recommendations to ministers about the pay of more than 500,000 teachers in England and Wales. But for the past seven years decisions have been determined by the government's limit on public sector pay. The review body made its recommendation in line with the limits on public sector pay, but warned ministers of potential problems of teacher shortages and funding pressures. The pay review body said there was a ""real risk that schools will not be able to recruit and retain a workforce of high quality teachers to support pupil achievement"". There is also a warning that schools are ""working under increasing financial constraints"". ""Between now and 2020, many schools will face both real-terms reductions in the level of per-pupil funding and growing cost pressures. Difficult choices may be inescapable,"" says the pay body. The pay limit was part of the government's efforts to reduce the budget deficit following the financial crash. Russell Hobby, leader of the National Association of Head Teachers, said the outcome was ""deeply disappointing"". He criticised that the pay review body ""had its hands tied"" and could not recommend a pay award ""based on the evidence"". Kevin Courtney, leader of the National Union of Teachers, said that after successive years with pay falling behind inflation that some teachers were ""finding life very difficult"". ""The public sector needs a pay rise,"" said Mr Courtney. James Westhead, executive director of Teach First, said that ""recruiting teachers is becoming more and more challenging. We need to ensure teaching is fairly rewarded"". The 1% increase will see the overall annual teachers' pay bill for England rise by about Â£505m to Â£25.3bn, with the extra cost to come out of the government's existing allocation of funding for schools. Newly-qualified teachers from the autumn will have a starting salary of almost Â£23,000, with the upper pay scale for classroom teachers going up to about Â£38,700. Head teachers' pay will range from Â£44,500 to over Â£100,000. Labour's shadow education secretary Angela Rayner said the government needed to clarify how schools would pay for the increase - or whether it would be ""squeezed"" from budgets that were already under pressure. ""There are now more questions than answers about their education policy, and schools urgently need some certainty,"" said Ms Rayner. Layla Moran, the Liberal Democrat education spokeswoman, said: ""Giving teachers another below inflation pay-rise is frankly an insult to these incredibly hard working and dedicated professionals."" A Department of Education spokeswoman said:  ""We recognise and value the hard work of teachers which is why we have accepted the pay deal proposed by the independent School Teachers' Review Body, in line with the 1% public sector pay policy. ""This will ensure we continue to strike the balance between being fair to public sector workers and fair to taxpayers."" Public sector pay: Will they or won't they?

"This video can not be played Commander Stuart Cundy: ""We are absolutely determined"" The Metropolitan Police believe there were about 255 survivors from last month's fire at Grenfell Tower. Police say ""extensive investigations"" led them to conclude 350 people should have been in the Kensington tower block on the night of the blaze on 14 June. That night, 14 residents were not in the building, leaving at least 80 people dead or missing, the Met said. Detective Chief Inspector Andy Chalmers, leading the Met's operation, described the task as ""unprecedented"". In the update to its operation, which includes a criminal investigation into why the fire began, police said the coroner had formally identified 32 bodies. ""You can't listen to the families and to the 999 calls and not want to hold people to account for a fire that should not have happened,"" said Metropolitan Police Commander Stuart Cundy. Speaking after the briefing, Cdr Cundy denied claims from former residents and politicians that the number killed in the tragedy could be far higher than 80. ""We've been working tirelessly to ascertain how many people died in the fire,"" he said, describing the night as one where ""the lives of so many changed forever"". Labour MP David Lammy told BBC's Newsnight in June that he was ""sympathetic"" to the view that the number of dead was being covered up. In depth: Grenfell Tower fire Why is it taking so long to name victims? Reality check: Grenfell housing promise Scotland Yard believes around 10 people managed to escape the tower ""but for a number of different reasons"" were not willing to come forward. The government has promised not toconduct immigration checks on survivors and those coming forward with informationin a bid to aid the investigation. It has also said tenants illegally subletting flats in the tower would not face charges. Cdr Cundy said the Met's investigations would ""not be hampered in any way"" by aseparate judge-led public inquiry into the blaze. ""We are absolutely determined to do everything new can to identify what offences have been committed,""  he said. ""We will seize information for wherever it comes from."" Detectives said they were looking at ""every aspect of fire safety"" at Grenfell - including fire doors, exit routes and emergency procedures. So far, 140 witnesses have been spoken to, with plans to interview the 650 firefighters and 300 police officers involved in the rescue operation, and all residents. The retired judge leading the public inquiry, Sir Martin Moore-Bick, said it would seek to discover the truth about what happened at Grenfell Tower, ""so that we can learn lessons for the future"". Sir Martinrecently held a meeting with residentsalso attended by the Met. The first public hearings are expected to be held in September. By Tom Symonds, BBC home affairs correspondent: Since the fire, the claim that 150 or more people lost their lives has persisted. After all, there is no official register of those living in the tower and a list provided by Kensington and Chelsea Council has proved to be inaccurate. As a result, it was crucial that police worked out how many people should have been in the tower that night. Their estimate of 350 is far fewer than the 500 to 600 people claimed by some. And 14 people, police say, were out for the night. Police also say that many of the flats were not family-sized, but one or two-bed properties, which may explain the belief that more people were living there. It has also been said that sub-letting may have resulted in the tower having a ""hidden"" population. Police have identified 10 people who didn't want to come forward to confirm they had survived. The police have repeatedly explained their methodology, which has not been challenged. Unless major flaws are found in the way detectives have attempted to get the truth, its likely the final number of dead at Grenfell Tower will be around 80. Cdr Cundy said the Grenfell investigation was ""probably one of the biggest investigations the Metropolitan Police has conducted outside of a terror attack"". There are 250 specialist investigators working on the Met's operation, including the process of identifying those who died, and finding out how the fire started. Scotland Yard said forensic pathologists were sieving through debris in the building to look for human remains. ""Phase one"" of the operation - removing identifiable bodies - has now been completed. All remains have been scanned for objects which may be used to identify victims, such as surgical implants, personal jewellery, glasses and teeth. Cdr Cundy said officers involved ""can't help but have an emotional attachment to this case"". The police investigation into the causes of the fire is also continuing, including an examination of ""all criminal offences that may have been committed"".

Twenty-one people were killed on 21 November 1974 when bombs exploded in two city centre pubs. Six innocent men were wrongfully convicted. No-one has ever been brought to justice for one of the worst single losses of life in the Troubles. Michael Christopher Hayes said he was sorry innocent people were killed.

This video can not be played The Birmingham pub bombings explained Relatives of those killed have rejected the apology as ""gutless and spineless"". An inquest into the bombings has been re-opened following a campaign by victims' families, who feel they have been denied justice and that their loved ones have been forgotten.

"Players and staff raised the alarm when Mr Pugh got into difficulty A golf company director has been jailed after a ball collector drowned in a freezing course lake. Dale Pike, 25, of Glynneath, Neath Port Talbot, ""stood and watched"" as Gareth Pugh dived into the lake with a weighted belt to fish out balls. Mr Pugh's body was found in the water at Peterstone Lakes Golf Club, near Newport, after he lost his breathing equipment anddrowned in February 2016. Pike received 32 months after admitting manslaughter by gross negligence. Mr Pugh was using a flotation device and air compressor while searching the lake for balls Cardiff Crown Court heard Pike raised the alarm when he noticed a constant stream of bubbles rising to the lake's surface and a flotation device carrying Mr Pugh's air supply floating towards the edge. Emergency service staff pulled him from the water 70 minutes after he first entered and he was found with his feet pointing upwards, weighed down by a weighted belt and a 16kg (35lbs) bag of 341 golf balls he had retrieved. The court heard Pike, who ran Boss Golf Balls which sells balls retrieved from lakes, should have hired trained divers to carry out the work, at a cost of about Â£1,000 a day. But instead he employed Mr Pugh, who had ADHD and learning difficulties, and paid him Â£20-40 a day. Dale Pike was told he had ""a cavalier attitude towards safety"" David Elias QC, defending, said Pike ""naively and foolishly believed that all would be well with the use of that equipment in that lake"". Sentencing Pike, Judge Keith Thomas said: ""Mr Pugh was an unsuitable contender for the diving work you employed him to undertake, but you allowed him to take those risks to make a quick buck. ""The risk of death or serious injury was obvious to you, but your cavalier attitude towards safety was the cause of Mr Pugh's death. ""With hindsight you bitterly regret what happened."" A bag of golf balls retrieved by Mr Pugh Speaking after the hearing, Iwan Jenkins, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said Pike ""stood by and watched"" as Mr Pugh entered the water ""knowing that safety regulations were being breached"". ""His deceit and callousness resulted in Gareth losing his life,"" he said. ""There was clear evidence Pike had made enquiries with legitimate dive operators to cost this activity but he chose not to use them, instead falsely claiming to the golf club that he was a qualified commercial diver with his own equipment."" Mr Pugh's partner Mayree Worton said: ""What upsets me the most is the bond that our daughter and Gareth had together is no longer there. ""The sentencing of Dale Pike is a relief, however it doesn't make what has happened any less painful, upsetting or distressing and it does not bring Gareth back.""

"Ms Morris has been MP for Newton Abbot since 2010 A Conservative MP has been suspended from the party after it emerged she used a racist expression during a public discussion about Brexit. Anne Marie Morris, the MP for Newton Abbot, used the phrase at an event in London to describe the prospect of the UK leaving the EU without a deal. She told the BBC: ""The comment was totally unintentional. I apologise unreservedly for any offence caused."" The Conservative Party later confirmed she had had the whip withdrawn. Announcing the suspension, Theresa May said she was ""shocked"" by the ""completely unacceptable"" language. ""I immediately asked the chief whip to suspend the party whip,"" she said in a statement. ""Language like this has absolutely no place in politics or in today's society."" The BBC understands the prime minister and Conservative Chief Whip Gavin Williamson met to discuss the matter once Mrs May finished her Commons statement on last weekend's G20 summit. According to a recording published on theHuffington Post,externalwebsite, Ms Morris was discussing the impact of Brexit on the UK's financial services industry at an event organised by the Politeia think tank, which was attended by other MPs. Suggesting that just 7% of financial services would be affected by Brexit, she reportedly said: ""Now I am sure there will be many people who will challenge that but my response and my request is look at the detail - it isn't all doom and gloom."" She went on: ""Now we get to the real nigger in the woodpile, which is in two years what happens if there is no deal."" Peer's apology over racist phrase,external Race gaffe politician 'foolish' The phrase originated in the American Deep South in the mid-19th Century and is thought to have referred to slaves having to conceal themselves as they sought to flee north and secure their freedom. It was subsequently used in the 20th Century - including by a number of leading novelists - as a metaphor to describe a hidden fact or problem. The Lib Dems had called on Theresa May to withdraw the whip from Ms Morris, who was first elected to Parliament in 2010 and was subsequently re-elected in 2015 and earlier this year. Leader Tim Farron said he was ""shocked"" and called for her to be suspended from the parliamentary party. ""This disgusting comment belongs in the era of the Jim Crow laws and has no place in our Parliament,"" he said. Labour's Andrew Gwynne said Ms Morris had used ""outrageous and completely unacceptable"" language. Green Party leader Caroline Lucas called on Ms Morris to resign as an MP, telling Sky News: ""There is no place for her in the House of Commons."" She also claimed that other Conservative MPs at the meeting ""apparently did not bat an eyelid"" at Ms Morris's language. ""At the very least, there ought to be a conversation between Theresa May and the others in that room so that they're very clear going forward that if ever that kind of language is heard in the earshot, it has to be condemned immediately,"" Ms Lucas said. Labour MP Chuka Umunna tweeted: ""Speechless, not just at the remark being made but also at the reported lack of a reaction from the Tories there. Utterly appalling."" Politeia's website,externalsaid MPs Sir William Cash, Kwasi Kwarteng and John Redwood also took part, though Mr Kwarteng told the BBC he was not there. The BBC has contacted the other MPs for comment. Ms Morris did face criticism from Tory colleagues, one of whom, Heidi Allen, tweeted: ""I'm afraid an apology is not good enough - we must show zero tolerance for racism. MPs must lead by example."" Fellow Conservative MP Helen Grant tweeted: ""Inconceivable for an MP using that expression to be incognisant of its history, impact and complete unacceptability. So ashamed!"" In 2008, Conservative peer and party spokesmanLord Dixon-Smith apologised,externalfor using the same phrase in the House of Lords, saying that it was not appropriate and that he had ""left his brains behind"". The peer was not dismissed.

"This video can not be played Glasgow mum confronts thief who stole son's bike A Glaswegian mother who handed out a hard-hitting ""life lecture"" to a teenager caught with her son's stolen bike has been hailed a ""supermum"". Vonnie Sandlan used social media to trace the bike after it was stolen in Glasgow city centre on Saturday night. In an often hilariousFacebook video,external, the brave mum said she posed as a buyer before confronting the boy. She won plaudits after revealing that she told the boy he could ""end up in Barlinnie"" - Glasgow's prison. She then gave him a hug. Ms Sandlan, the former president of NUS Scotland, even told the boy to think about college or an apprenticeship ""if school wasn't working out for him"". She said: ""Part of me really hopes that the kid gets in trouble and it properly scares him and that's enough. ""Part of me hopes that he just genuinely takes it as an opportunity to make some better life choices."" The drama unfolded after her son Findlay's bike was taken from outside McDonald's on Argyle Street at about 21:30 on Saturday. He had bought the cycle just a few days earlier and the theft had left the 16-year-old ""distraught"", Ms Sandlan told her followers. ""He's been less upset when pets have died,"" she said. ""He used his birthday money for it, he'd been saving up for ages. It's a big deal."" She said she reported the theft to Police Scotland but understood they could not deal with it as they had other priorities. Instead, she turned detective and launched a social media campaign in a bid to find her son's prized possession. By Sunday, she had received a tip off that it was for sale on the Gumtree website. After checking that it was definitely Findlay's bike, she called the police. She said they supported her plan to arrange to retrieve the bike. While her friend filmed the meeting from a nearby bus stop, Ms Sandlan and her husband, Bob, met the boy with the bike outside The Forge shopping centre. In her Facebook Live post, she said: ""The kid came over and he stopped in front of the bike and I was giving it big smiles and went over and put my hand on the bike and I said 'Thanks so much for coming out to meet us on such a miserable day as well, we would have came to your house'. ""And I looked underneath the frame and I checked the serial number, then I just said 'This is my bike'. And the kid just burst into tears."" She went on: ""So this kid is just like crying in front of me, saying 'Is it really your bike?' And I said 'Yeah, it's really my bike - it's not your bike, is it?' ""And then he's like 'It's my first time, it's my first time' and I was like 'I think we both know that's not true, pal'. ""And then somehow I ended up like pure giving him a life lecture on how this is a turning point in his life and it could have been so much worse if it had been somebody else who had came and just like battered him to get the bike back off him. ""And what he needed to be doing was thinking of his future and he said, 'I'm only 15'. ""And I said, you know what, if school's not working out for you, you need to start thinking about college or like go and do an apprenticeship or something. Stop stealing because you're terrible at it and you're going to end up in Barlinnie."" The video, which ends with Findlay agreeing that his mum is the ""best in the world"", has been viewed thousands of times since it was posted on Sunday night. A police spokesman said: ""Always use 101 in circumstances like this. Let us know what's happening and let us deal with the confrontation side of things."" Gumtree said it did not tolerate stolen items on its website. A spokesperson said: ""We encourage users to report anything suspicious to us through the 'report' button that sits on every ad on our website. ""Our dedicated safety team will then investigate. If you are concerned that an item you're viewing is stolen, don't buy it - report it to the police. ""We work regularly with law enforcement to share information and aid their investigations. ""We're pleased to hear that Vonnie and her son Findlay have been reunited with their bike, and recommend that all bike owners register their serial number with a service such as Bike Register.""

"This video can not be played The ""run, hide, tell"" film shows holidaymakers what to do in the event of a terror attack A video advising UK holidaymakers what to do in the event of a terror attack abroad has been released by police. The four-minute film depicts a firearms attack unfolding at a hotel and uses the ""run, hide, tell"" safety message. Thirty British tourists were among 38 people killed when a gunman attacked a Tunisian beach resort in June 2015. Counter terrorism police said there is no specific intelligence Britons will be targeted this summer and the film is part of a general awareness campaign. But Det Ch Supt Scott Wilson told the BBC it was ""only right"" to offer advice following the terror attacks in London and in Sousse, Tunisia. ""These people are not there to steal a mobile phone or steal your watch, they are there to kill you, you have to get yourself out of that danger zone,"" Mr Wilson told the BBC. ""It's very unlikely [that you will be caught up in a terror attack]. ""It's very much like the safety briefing  you get on an aeroplane before it takes off - it's very unlikely that plane is going to crash, but it's very important you are given that knowledge of what you should and what you shouldn't do."" The four-minute video tells holidaymakers what to do during a terror attack on their resort It depicts a firearms attack unfolding at a hotel The video has been produced with the Foreign Office and travel association Abta. Mr Wilson said 23,000 representatives from major UK holiday companies at resorts all over the world had been trained in what to do in the event of a terror attack as well as how to spot suspicious items and activity. What should you do in an attack?

"This video can not be played Camden Lock fire eyewitness: ""I could see flames"" A huge blaze broke out overnight at Camden Lock Market in north London. Seventy firefighters and 10 fire engines were sent to the site, which is a popular tourist attraction, London Fire Brigade (LFB) said. A fire officer at the scene said the fire began in a building containing a number of businesses. It affected a small section of the area and many stalls and shops were ""operating and welcoming visitors and customers as usual"", the market said. Market is 'our heart and soul' London Ambulance Service was called in, but confirmed it had not treated any patients. Major fires have hit the sprawling market area twice before in recent years, in 2008 and 2014. LFB said the first, second and third floors and the roof of the building had been damaged. ""Crews worked hard to get the fire under control and to stop it from spreading to neighbouring buildings,"" station manager David Reid said. BBC Radio London reporter Barry Caffrey said he had been told by a fire officer at the scene the blaze had begun in a building with an Honest Burger restaurant on the ground floor. LFB took 37 emergency calls about the fire The fire spread across several floors of the building Deana Irwin, who lives next to the market, saw flames blazing ""about 5m high from the top of the building"". Witness Joan Ribes, 24, said: ""I was just passing by when I saw the fire and they started to get firefighters and police, it was all very fast. ""We called the police to close the street to the traffic because it was very dangerous, the fire was flying through the air to the surrounding areas."" Fire officers said the fire began in a building where Honest Burger is based The market, which has been based in the area since 1974, has more than 1,000stalls and shops. Deicola and Leora Neves, who own Camden Guitars which is based in the burnt building, said their shop had been destroyed and ""everything has gone"". ""This is where we started and we're really feeling the loss of that,"" Ms Neves said. Market worker Kareem Khodeir said he believed about 100 traders would have been affected by the blaze and some would be ""finished"" as a result. ""There were 30-35 permanent stalls in the building who have completely lost everything while those who trade outside also store their stock in there. ""It most likely will destroy a few businesses completely,"" he said. Alex Proud, founder of the Proud Galleries in Camden, said the fire brigade had ""turned up incredibly quickly and stopped what could have been a really substantial fire which could have wiped out the market"". ""These are old buildings, they go back to the 1840s,"" he added. He said only about 5-10% of the market had been damaged and ""75% of the market is now open"". Damping down has been continuing at the scene, the fire brigade said It's a tourist hotspot that attracts millions and an area of the capital with rich rock 'n' roll history. But Camden Lock Market is also the livelihood of many small businesses and a stone's throw from local residents who had to watch as the fire took hold. Nestled next to Regent's Canal and beside Camden's railway bridge, visitors have vast quantities of shops to explore and cuisine to sample. Now the Market Hall - a four storey building filled with independent traders who often make their own products - looks badly burnt, with broken windows and a strong smell of smoke surrounding it. ""The hard work and aggressive action of the fire crews ensured it didn't spread to the nearby buildings,"" said London Fire Brigade station manager Andrew Walton. Ozgur Kaya works on a jewellery stall in the building. ""Some of the traders have lost everything,"" he said. ""They are so upset. We are all here to be there for them."" Sam Row, who runs a vintage camera stall in the shadow of the building, only discovered the news when he came to work first thing. ""All my kit is in there,"" he said. ""I don't know if it is safe, if it has been damaged by fire or water. It's very worrying for us."" Crews battled to stop the fire spreading in the tight alleyways around Camden Market The ambulance service said it sent a clinical team leader and a Hazardous Area Response Team. At about 03:00 the LFB said the blaze was ""now under control but crews will be damping down into the morning"". In a statement, the brigade said: ""Four fire engines and around 20 firefighters will remain at the scene on Monday."" The cause of the blaze is unknown. The market has over 1,000 shops and stalls On 8 February 2008, the famous celebrity hauntThe Hawley Arms,externalwas severely damaged in a blaze, along with six shops and 90 market stalls. In 2014, some 600 people fled ablaze in the Stables Market. The market, located in the former Pickfords stables and Grade II-listed horse hospital, burned for two hours on the evening of 20 May.

"Youtubers have started creating protest videos and memes ahead of the day of action. This week some of the internet's most popular websites will look quite different, as they participate in a day of action on Wednesday 12 July to oppose changes to US rules which govern net neutrality. Sites such as Netflix and Amazon are joining with civil liberty groups in a co-ordinated protest, and activists are already sharing viral content onTwitter,external,Reddit,externalandFacebook,externalin preparation. So why all the outcry - and who's behind the social media campaign? Net neutralityis the principle that an internet service provider (ISP) should give consumers equal access to all legal content regardless of its source. To put it another way, if the networks which form the bedrock of the internet were a motorway, then under net neutrality, there wouldn't be fast lanes for cars and slow lanes for lorries. Motorists wouldn't be able to pay to use a faster route. All data regardless of its size, is on a level playing field. In practice what this means is that ISPs - the biggest ones in the US include Comcast, Charter and AT&T - cannot block content, speed up or slow down data from particular websites because they have been paid to do so. And they can't give preferential treatment to their own content at the expense of their competitors. Proponents of net neutrality say it's a matter of fairness, that it limits censorship and ensures that large ISPs can't unfairly choke off other content providers. But opponents say it amounts to an undue restriction on business, that regulation stifles investment in new technology, and that net neutrality laws are outdated. Memes like this one are being circulated ahead of the day of action The US Federal Communications Commission (FCC), withthe support of the Obama administrationintroduced new net neutrality regulations in 2015, after an extensive campaign by activist groups and tech companies. Those rules put ISPs in the same category as other telecommunication companies. But President Trump is a vocal critic of the measures, and he appointed a net neutrality opponent,former commissioner Ajit Pai, to chair the FCC at the beginning of this year. Pai said he fears that internet service providers arenot investing in critical infrastructure,externalsuch as connections to low income or rural households because the net neutrality rules prevent them from making money from their investments. Ajit Pai, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, has been a prominent critic of net neutrality regulations FCC commissioners voted to start the process to end net neutrality rulesin May, and the commission is now conducting a public consultation on the issue. Americans have until the end of August to comment on the plans. Although it's a tech-world phenomenon and a political debate, the issue has attracted the attention of some prominent celebrities outside of Silicon Valley and Washington. One of the most outspoken has been British comedian John Oliver, the presenter of Last Week Tonight, who was instrumental in getting the issue of net neutrality trending when the vote results were released, after his tirade against theFCC's decision went viral,external. John Oliver has released YouTube films to continue his campaign in support of net neutrality. Oliver has long been interested in the issue and was one of the champions of the regulations when they were first introduced, and his call to arms saw thousands of people post comments on the FCC website. Some reports even claimed the FCC's website crashed because of the influx, but the commission later said the crash was due to adenial of service attack by hackers.,external With the deadline for comments on the FCC's decision looming, tech companies have decided to take co-ordinated action. On 12 July, huge tech companies such as Amazon will join more than 170 organisations which will ""slow down"" their services to protest the proposed change. The protest is an attempt to simulate what could potentially happen to popular websites if net neutrality rules are scrapped. The companies will show advertisements and pop ups which encourage users to comment on adedicated campaign website,external. Notices like this will appear on popular websites such as Etsy, Mozilla, Vimeo and Kickstarter. Twitter and Reddit are to encourage users to participate in the FCC consultation by sharing gifs like this which mimic loading screens. One of the organisations behind the protest is the Mozilla Foundation, developers of the Firefox web browser. ""We've already received some 40,000 comments from people in the US"" in response to a campaign, said Mozilla Foundation vice president Ashley Boyd. ""On the day people will see some of those comments on our snippet which sits on the front page of Firefox."" ""The problem with this debate is that it can seem very entrenched, with people from big companies on both sides sticking to their views, but we want to showcase that this does have an impact on real people,"" Boyd told BBC Trending. The Mozilla Foundation has created a podcast in which experts offer their take on net neutrality - they also plan to share videos on the day of action BBC Trending on Facebook,external But it's not just supporters of net neutrality who will be active on social media on Wednesday. ISPs are also planning to make their case. Comcast, the largest cable provider in the US, has already started sharing messages stating they support the general principle of net neutrality, but are opposed to the FCC's existing rules. Comcast argues that they support net neutrality, but that the regulation which classified their company as a ""Title II"" telecommunications carrier is outdated and heavy handed. In a blog post, Comcast executiveDavid Cohen wrote,external: ""We have and will continue to support strong, legally enforceable net neutrality protections that ensure a free and Open Internet for our customers, with consumers able to access any and all the lawful content they want at any time"". The company has backed plans for legislation to protect net neutrality, but claims that the current rules have led to ""years of legal wrangling"" and uncertainty due to the shift from the Obama administration to Trump's policies. The company - and other ISPs - worry that a future president could change the rules yet again. The challenge for the pro-net neutrality crowd in Silicon Valley is to try and explain the technical nuances of the debate to non-technical people, particularly as most ordinary users of the internet would probably not have noticed a significant change when the rules were introduced in the first place. Stack Overflow,externalis an American social network of specialists who are trying to fill the knowledge gap. The site follows a question and answer format, with the best answers being voted to the top by members. ModeratorJosh Heyer,externaltold BBC Trending that users had been lobbying the company for years to try and get it to take a position in favour of net neutrality. ""Within the company we recognise this is something which had huge potential to cause big problems for lots of our audience,"" he said. ""Historically net neutrality rules have been socially enforced, but the whole reason we are having this debate is because it seemed to us that some users of the internet were not sticking to these conventions,"" he said. ""I tried to explain net neutrality to some friends the other day, and I realised I had been speaking for more than an hour and my friends were still confused."" Campaigners for net neutrality enlisted the help of their mothers to get their voices heard during a Mother's Day flurry of activity Programmers such asElliott Brown,externalfrom Ohio have been participating in the debate on Stack Overflow. ""I'm not a political activist, I don't want to sway a person's vote one way or the other but I feel they need to have the right information at their fingertips,"" he told BBC Trending. ""I've been writing concrete and simple examples which frame this debate in laymen's terms and sending them to friends. No one except us has made the effort to read all the literature, we have a responsibility to explain it."" Brown is firmly in favour of net neutrality. ""It has huge implications for the whole internet. In the US there are only four or five major carriers. If they were to collaborate they could strangle data access to parts of the internet, it's not an understatement to say they could influence history,"" he said. With the pro-neutrality activists dominating social media it's easy to believe that the vast majority of tech workers and activists support the existing rules. But there are different perspectives within the tech community. Texan programmerBen Collins,externalused to work at Stack Exchange and has spent more than a decade in the industry. He told Trending that he thinks the FCC's changes won't amount to the ""doomsday"" for the open internet that many have predicted. ""Fundamentally we want free markets to work, and that the best way for that to happen is for there to be little regulation,"" he said. ""In the history of the internet there was basically no regulation until this came in, and from my perspective it seems like the only reason we changed things at a fundamental level is because some people were nervous that we might get charged a bit more for fast internet access."" Collins argues that market pressure will provide an incentive for ISPs to make sure their customers are happy, and that opponents of the rules will be relatively subdued this week - but only because they believe they've already won the argument. ""There is market pressure on Comcast and the other providers not to treat their customers poorly,"" he said. ""A lot of the arguments in favour [of net neutrality] seem to boil down to me that 'I want better internet access to my house'. The market will provide this but it takes time."" ""I might call my representative next Wednesday to share this point of view, but really I think the reason you won't see many people saying they want to scrap the regulations on social media is because the commissioners have already made their minds up,"" he said.

"Charlie's parents had raised more than Â£1.3m to take him to the US for treatment The plight of Charlie Gard attracted worldwide attention as a result of the legal fight that pitched his desperate parents against the medical profession. But at the heart of it all is an 11-month-old baby who has spent his entire young life in a hospital bed. This is how his story unfolded. Charlie was born on 4 August 2016 with an exceptionally rare genetic condition called encephalomyopathic mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome (MDDS). Although he appeared perfectly healthy when he was born, his health soon began to deteriorate. Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) said the moment Charlie was diagnosed, his prognosis was bleak. Charlie now has severe brain damage and cannot open his eyes or move his arms or legs. His condition also means he is unable to breathe unaided, which is why he needs to be on a ventilator. His heart, liver and kidneys are also affected, and his doctors say it is not clear if he feels pain. Charlie's parents, Connie Yates and Chris Gard, from Bedfont in west London, wanted Charlie to have an experimental treatment called nucleoside bypass therapy (NBT). The treatment is not invasive and can be added to food. A hospital in the US agreed to offer Charlie the treatment, and Charlie's parents hadraised Â£1.3m in funds to take him there. Under a High Court ruling, GOSH is forbidden from allowing Charlie to be transferred for nucleoside therapy anywhere No animal or human with Charlie's condition (RRM2B deficiency) has been treated with NBT, but the treatment has been previously offered to patients with a similar genetic disorder, TK2 deficiency. But TK2 affects just the muscles, whereas Charlie's condition also affects other organs and his brain. GOSH did apply for ethical permission to attempt nucleoside therapy on Charlie. However, by the time that decision was made Charlie's condition had greatly worsened and the view was his brain damage was too severe and irreversible for the treatment to help. After contacting other experts in the condition from medical centres across the world, doctors came to the conclusion that Charlie's life support should be switched off and he should be allowed to die with dignity. Charlie's parents disagreed with the hospital and did not want his life support to be withdrawn, so doctors applied to the High Court for judges to decide Charlie's future. In April, the High Court agreed with the GOSH doctors. Charlie's parents then appealed against the decision, but courts ruled the original decision should stand and it would be in Charlie's best interests to be allowed to die with dignity. The Supreme Court and the European Court both came to the same conclusion. Although Charlie's parents had seemingly exhausted all legal avenues, two prominent figures ensured Charlie's case became world news: Donald Trump and the Pope. Following the European Court ruling, thePope said he was following the case""with affection and sadness"". A statement released from the Vatican said the Pope ""expresses his closeness to his [Charlie's] parents"". ""For them he prays, hoping that their desire to accompany and care for their own child to the end is not ignored,"" it said. The US president then offered his support, tweeting: ""If we can help little #CharlieGard, as per our friends in the U.K. and the Pope, we would be delighted to do so."" Allow Twitter content?

After his tweet, the US doctor offering the therapy, Professor Michio Hirano from Columbia University Medical Center, was contacted by the president's team to see if there was anything more that could be done. On 6 July, the professor co-signed a letter with other medical experts which suggested unpublished data showed therapy could improve the 11-month-old's brain condition. They claimed that ""ideally"" the treatment would first be tested on mice but said that, in Charlie's case, there was no time for such a trial. It was this unpublished data that prompted GOSHto apply to the High Court for a fresh hearing""in light of claims of new evidence"" relating to potential treatment for Charlie's condition. Under the initial High Court ruling, Charlie was not allowed to be transferred anywhere to be treated so it asked the court to examine the new evidence. During this time, Professor Hiranoflew over from Americato examine Charlie. Supporters have protested outside the High Court Charlie's plight has proved to be very divisive. Some people felt Charlie should be allowed to die with dignity, while others have disagreed with the doctors, arguing Charlie's parents should be allowed to decide where he is treated. At one point the hospital saidstaff had received death threatsand police had been called after other families, whose children were being treated at the hospital, had been harassed. Charlie's parents said they did not condone the abuse and had also faced ""nasty and hurtful remarks"". After examining Charlie, Professor Hirano saidit was now too late to give Charlie the therapy. He came to the conclusion after seeing the results of a new MRI scan taken last week. The scan had shown there was no muscle at all in parts of his body. After hearing this, Charlie's parents decided to abandon the legal proceedings and ruled out taking him to the US. They believe he could have lived a normal life if he had been given treatment earlier, but said they now wanted to treasure the short time they had left with him. In its statement to the High Court on 24 July,external, the hospital said it was ""increasingly surprised and disappointed"" that Professor Hirano ""had not read Charlie's contemporaneous medical records or viewed Charlie's brain imaging or read all of the second opinions about Charlie's condition"". GOSH said the professor had not taken the opportunity to see Charlie until last week, despite being offered the chance to do so by the hospital in January. Even though the professor gave written evidence at all of the court cases, the hospital said it only emerged last week that he had not read the judge's ruling following the first High Court hearing in April. The hospital added it was concerned to hear the professor state in the witness box at the High Court hearing on 13 July that he had a financial interest in some of the treatment he proposed prescribing for Charlie. Professor Hirano said in a statement on 25 July he had ""relinquished"" that financial interest. Charlie's life support will be withdrawn at a hospice but lawyers acting for Charlie's parents were in dispute with doctors over the detail of care plans. Chris Gard and Connie Yates had applied to the High Court to keep Charlie alive for ""a week or so"" - longer than originally planned. But a judge ruled that Charlie would be moved to a hospice to spend his final few hours before the ventilator that keeps him alive is switched off. 3 March 2017: Mr Justice Francis starts to analyse the case at a hearing in the family division of the High Court in London 11 April: He says doctors can stop providing life-support treatment 3 May: Charlie's parents ask Court of Appeal judges to consider the case 23 May: Three Court of Appeal judges analyse the case 25 May: The Court of Appeal judges dismiss the couple's appeal 8 June: Charlie's parents lose their fight in the Supreme Court 20 June: Judges in the European Court of Human Rights start to analyse the case, after lawyers representing Charlie's parents make written submissions 27 June: Judges in the European Court of Human Rights refuse to intervene 3 July: The Pope and US President Donald Trump offer to intervene 4 July: The Vatican's children's hospital in Rome, offers to take in Charlie 7 July: Great Ormond Street Hospital applies for a fresh hearing at the High Court 10 July: Charlie's parents return to the High Court and ask Mr Justice Francis to carry out a fresh analysis of the case. Mr Justice Francis says he will consider any new evidence. 17 July - Dr Michio Hirano, the US neurologist, travels to London to examine Charlie 21 July - Lawyer representing Great Ormond Street says Charlie's new scan makes for ""sad reading"" 22 July - Great Ormond Street says doctors and nurses have been subjected to abuse and received threatening messages 24 July - Charlie's parents say they will end their legal fight for his treatment and let him die 27 July -  A judge rules that Charlie will be moved to a hospice to spend his final hours before the ventilator that keeps him alive is switched off.

"The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee - the group that will help organise what the party hopes will be a successful push to take control of US House of Representatives in mid-term US elections next year - recently tested out some new bumper-sticker slogans. It did not go well. There wereseveral variations,externalon the resist/persist theme and one that promised to ""Make Congress blue again"", referencing the colour associated with the Democratic Party on electoral maps. Drawing the most attention - and scorn - however was: ""Democrats 2018: I mean, have you seen the other guys?"" Opposition to President Trump and Republicans has been a uniting and motivating factor for Democrats since last November. It has led to massive protests in cities across the US and a fundraising windfall for many politicians and activist groups. At this point, however, some on the left are hoping for a message that's a bit more affirmative; that offers something to vote for, not against. For them, the bumper sticker was a reminder that the Democratic Party doesn't have a cohesive pitch to voters. The Democratic Party is in search of a slogan ""Democrats are faced with a dilemma heading into 2018: Are they willing to stand up for the idea of universal healthcare, or do they really think they can win with 'have you seen the other guys?'""writes,externalCharlie May on the liberal website Salon. Drew Magary of GQ waseven more blunt,external. ""The political hopes of a majority of Americans currently reside in the hands of a party that has all the strategic acumen of Elmer Fudd and, even worse, still doesn't realise its shortcomings,"" he writes. If the Democrats lack a clear vision, if their message to America seems to some like it's been crafted by a committee, part of the reason can be simply explained. A vision demands a visionary; a message requires a messenger. The party's rank and file are in search of a champion, and a rotating cast of Democratic politicians have taken the spotlight in the past few months, only to cede it to the next contestant. Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren gave a Senate floor speech that drew the ire of Republican leader Mitch McConnell, launching a thousand ""but she persisted"" gifs. Freshman California Senator Kamala Harris had her star turn, sparring with Attorney General Jeff Sessions during his recent committee testimony on Russian election hacking. Even Hillary Clinton, who still generates mixed feelings from some Democrats after her electoral defeat, edged in on the action last week, thanks to a snide Republican National Committee tweet accusing Democrats opposed to Mr Trump's healthcare reform of not offering their own solutions. ""Where's your plan?"" the Republicansasked,externalof the former secretary of state. ""Right here, includes radical provisions like how not to kick 23 million people off their coverage,""she wrote back,external, linking to a policy paper on her campaign website. ""Feel free to run w/it."" Then there's Bernie Sanders, who rode a grass-roots tsunami in the Democratic presidential primaries last year to record levels of fundraising, massive crowds and more than 13 million votes. He's still around, he's still raising money, and he's still speaking to huge audiences. Even though Mr Sanders will be 78 in 2020, Vox's Matthew Yglesiassays,externalhe should be considered the party's presidential front-runner. ""He's doing exactly what a candidate who fell short needs to do to run a second time,"" he writes. ""He's established a national political organisation, he's improved his ties with colleagues on Capitol Hill, he's maintained a heavy presence in national media, and he's travelling the country talking about issues."" Of course, if Mr Sanders becomes the face of the Democratic Party, he will take political fire the likes of which he has not yet seen. Bernie Sanders continues to hold rallies in front of large crowds Republicans have generally held their tongues, but the Vermont senator could feature prominently alongside House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi in mid-term election adverts. Democrats vying for the spotlight will be less reluctant than Mrs Clinton was in 2016 to engage the self-processed democratic socialist. With front-runner status comes a very large target painted on one's back. Just ask Jeb Bush. Mr Sanders' political perseverance is also a reminder that the divide within the Democratic Party that was exposed in the Sanders-Clinton primary fight still exists, even if it's been subsumed, somewhat, by anti-Trump fervour. In a New York Timesopinion piece,external, former 2008 Hillary Clinton campaign strategist Mark Penn and New York City Democratic politician Andrew Stein recommended their party head ""back to the centre"", saying that ""the siren calls of the left"" have weakened the party. The piece prompted howls of outrage from progressives everywhere. ""The whole op-ed is really just an endorsement of centrist white nationalism filled with catastrophically asinine proposals that, if adopted, would enrage most Democratic voters,"" Mark Joseph Sternwrites,externalin Slate. That could be just a taste of the internecine warfare to come. The Democrats hit bottom last November, with Donald Trump's elevation to the presidency, continued Republican control of Congress and decimation at the state legislative level, and they've been scraping along the bedrock ever since. While they've over-performed in several special elections in traditionally conservative congressional districts, ""better than expected"" results won't stop Republicans in 2018 or Mr Trump in 2020. Then again, the Republican situation seemed equally hopeless after Barack Obama's big wins in 2008 and 2012. The political wind almost certainly will be at Democrats' backs in the mid-term elections next year, even if there is no clear-cut leader giving voice to their cause. And heavily contested presidential primaries - as 2020 will almost certainly be for Democrats - are an excellent way of discerning who has the most potent political message for a party. Mr Trump himself was evidence of that last year. It's still very early in the game. That's both the good news for Democrats and - when each week in the Trump presidency seems like a lifetime - the bad news. Can routed Democrats ever top Trump?

"This video can not be played 'Peter' says he now drinks ""a bottle of spirits a day"" Two prison officers have spoken to the Victoria Derbyshire programme about the reality of working inside prisons in England and Wales in order, they say, to expose the problems the service is facing. Their identities have been changed. Alan worked for two years in a privately run prison before leaving last year. ""Officers are being assaulted, punched, boiling water poured in their faces - on a regular basis. ""I was punched, then excrement thrown in my face. He'd basically put excrement in a bag, he ran up behind me and shoved it in my face. Eyes, nose, mouth. ""It was the worst feeling in the world, we don't know their medical records.... the next day I was in the local hospital waiting for all the tests to see if I had contracted anything. ""In my opinion you've seen nothing yet. It's going to boil over very soon."" Peter has worked for more than 20 years in the service. ""Today I was on a shift, before I left we had a member of staff who ended up with a broken nose, a potential broken wrist and a potential broken finger. ""I've been on the end of a bad experience, a few years back, and that still lives with me. It never goes away. We attended a cell with two prisoners in it. We were dealing with their issues when they assaulted us. They used the leg of a metal chair to assault myself and my colleagues. ""There was a mass brawl on the floor, you don't know what or who is connected to who or what. And you try to do your best at that moment in time. I'd done some internal damage to my shoulder and required a couple of operations. ""It's only a matter of time before something massive goes off and either lots of prisoners will get hurt or lots of prison officers will get hurt. It will get to the stage where a prison officer will get killed on duty."" Synthetic drugs are a growing problem in England's prisons Alan: ""When I started, this drug known as spice, you'd have an incident a week, maybe two, very rare. But just before I left, you'd have three or four a day. Regular, regular, ambulances called to deal with a spice attack. We just couldn't control it, it literally got out of hand."" Peter: ""Prisoners are specifically now going out and doing a crime to be recalled as they can earn more money coming in with drugs, mobiles and Sim cards. That never happened 20 years ago."" Alan: ""They [the prisoners] spoke openly about friends and gang members getting caught for petty crimes, receiving two-year sentences, because they know when they get in there's quite a strong drug feed. They were talking about making several thousand pounds a month through selling drugs in prison."" ""Alan"" left his role in a privately run prison last year Peter: ""I was joining a service I was proud to join. Twenty years ago, you had time with prisoners. Time to engage, time to help them try and see that their actions were wrong. But now we haven't got the staff, we haven't got the time and we have prisoners who don't really care about changing their lives."" Alan: ""After the training - eight or nine weeks in total, you're on the wings and that's it. There's a massive sick rate and they're struggling to cover the wings. There were times, and I certainly wasn't on my own, when you were left to lock 64 prisoners behind the doors. ""I've seen it first hand where a prisoner has attacked another prisoner with a razor blade over a packet of tobacco. If you're on your own and you see something like that, which we did, you could be trying to split 15 to 20 blokes up."" Peter: ""We're getting officers who are 20, 21 years of age, what experience have they got of life? And they're telling a 40, 50-year-old to go behind the door, who's probably done 10 years already. There's no respect, no authority and no discipline."" Alan: ""I used to wake up in the morning and feel physically sick. When you've got a prisoner, he's threatening to rip your head off, he's going to stab you, he's going to get your kid shot, your missus shot, you don't know his capabilities."" Peter: ""I didn't drink before. But I drink most days just to get through. When I'm on holiday, I'm fine. [I drink] a lot, too much. Probably a bottle of spirits a night. Then we get up in the morning and pretend nothing is wrong as we have to put on a front."" A Ministry of Justice spokeswoman said it was ""committed to building on the essential reforms that are already under way to make prisons places of safety and reform. ""In November last year, we announced a major overhaul of the prison system, including 2,500 extra front-line officers and new measures to tackle violence, drugs and mobile phones,"" she added.

"Tally sticks, circa 1299, showing accounts of the bailiff of Ralph de Manton of Ufford Church, Northampton Not far from where I live is Oxford's Ashmolean Museum, home to art and antiquities from around the world. I often find myself slipping down the stairs to the money gallery in its grand basement. You can see coins from Rome, the Vikings, the Abbasid Caliphate and, closer to home, from medieval Oxfordshire and Somerset. But while it seems obvious that the money gallery would be full of coins, most money isn't in the form of coins at all. The trouble is, as Felix Martin points out in his book, Money: The Unauthorised Biography, that most of our monetary history hasn't survived in a form that could grace a museum. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economyhighlights the inventions, ideas and innovations which have helped create the economic world in which we live. It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can findmore information about the programme's sourcesandlisten onlineorsubscribe to the programme podcast. In fact, in 1834, the British government decided to destroy 600 years of precious monetary artefacts. It was a decision that was to have unfortunate consequences in more ways than one. The artefacts in question were humble sticks of willow, about eight inches (20cm) long, called Exchequer tallies. The willow was harvested along the banks of the Thames, not far from the Palace of Westminster in central London. Tallies were a way of recording debts with a system that was sublimely simple and effective. The stick would contain a record of the debt, for example: ""Â£9 4s 4d from Fulk Basset for the farm of Wycombe"". Fulk Basset was a Bishop of London in the 13th Century. He owed his debt to King Henry III. Now comes the elegant part. The stick would be split in half, down its length from one end to the other. The debtor would retain half, called the ""foil"". The creditor would retain the other half, called the ""stock"" - even today, British bankers use the word ""stocks"" to refer to debts of the British government. Because willow has a natural and distinctive grain, the two halves would match only each other. Some of the old wooden tally sticks used by the UK Exchequer until 1826 Of course, the Treasury could simply have kept a record of these transactions in a ledger somewhere. But the tally stick system enabled something radical to occur. If you had a tally stock showing that Bishop Basset owed you Â£5, then unless you worried that he wasn't good for the money, the tally stock itself was worth close to Â£5 in its own right. If you wanted to buy something, you might well find that the seller would be pleased to accept the tally stock as a safe and convenient form of payment. So the tally sticks themselves became a kind of money, a particular sort of debt that could be traded freely, circulating from person to person until it utterly separated from Bishop Basset and a farm in Wycombe. We don't have a good sense of whether tally sticks were in fact widely traded or not, for reasons that will become clear. But we know that similar debts were, some surprisingly recently. On Monday 4 May 1970, the Irish Independent, Ireland's leading newspaper, published a matter-of-fact notice with a straightforward title: Closure of banks. Every major bank in Ireland was closed and would remain closed until further notice. The banks were in dispute with their own employees, who had voted to strike, and it seemed likely that the whole business would drag on for weeks or even months. You might think that such news - in what was one of the world's more advanced economies - would inspire utter panic, but the Irish remained calm. They'd been expecting trouble, so had been stockpiling reserves of cash, but what kept the Irish economy going was something else. The Irish wrote each other cheques. People used cheques to cover expenses like bar bills, and publicans reused them to pay their suppliers Now, at first sight this makes no sense. Cheques are paper-based instructions to transfer money from one bank account to another. But if both banks are closed, then the instruction to transfer money can't be carried out - not until the banks open, anyway. But everyone in Ireland knew that might not happen for months. Nevertheless, people wrote each other cheques, and they circulated. Patrick would write a cheque for Â£20 to clear his tab at the local pub. The publican might then use that cheque to pay his staff, or his suppliers. Patrick's cheque would circulate around and around, a promise to pay Â£20 that couldn't be fulfilled until the banks reopened and started clearing the backlog. The system was fragile. It was clearly open to abuse by people who wrote cheques they knew would eventually bounce. As May dragged past, then June, then July, there was always the risk that people lost track of their own finances and started unknowingly writing cheques they couldn't afford and wouldn't be able to honour. Money via mobile: The M-Pesa revolution The warrior monks who invented banking What makes gambling wrong but insurance right? How the world's first accountants counted on cuneiform Perhaps the biggest risk of all was that trust would start to fray, that people would simply start refusing to accept cheques as payment. Yet the Irish kept writing each other cheques. It must have helped that so much Irish business was small and local. People knew their customers. They knew who was good for the money. Word would get around about people who cheated. And the pubs and corner shops were able to vouch for the creditworthiness of their customers, which meant that cheques could keep moving. When the dispute was resolved and the banks reopened in November, more than six months after they had closed, the Irish economy was still in one piece. The only problem: the backlog of Â£5bn worth of cheques would take another three months to clear. Nor is the Irish case the only one in which cheques were passed around without ever being cashed. In the 1950s, British soldiers stationed in Hong Kong would pay their bills with cheques on accounts back in England. The local merchants would circulate the cheques, vouching for them with their own signatures, without any great hurry to cash them in. Some British soldiers stationed in Hong Kong during the 1950s - like these troops bound for Korea - used cheques drawn on their home banks Effectively, the Hong Kong cheques - like the Irish cheques, like the Tally sticks - had become a form of private money. If money is simply tradable debt, then tally sticks and uncashed Irish cheques weren't some weird form of quasi-money. They were simply money in a particularly unvarnished form. Like an engine running with the cover off, or a building with the scaffolding still up, they're money with the underlying mechanism laid bare. Of course, we still naturally think of money as those discs of metal in the Ashmolean Museum. After all it's the metal that survives, not the cheques or the tally sticks. Those tally sticks, by the way, met an unfortunate end. The system was finally abolished and replaced by paper ledgers in 1834 after decades of attempts to modernise. A decision to burn the obsolete tally sticks in 1834 nearly destroyed the Palace of Westminster To celebrate, it was decided to burn the sticks - six centuries of irreplaceable monetary records - in a coal-fired stove in the House of Lords, rather than letting parliamentary staff take them home for firewood. Burning a cartload or two of tally sticks in a coal-fired stove is a wonderful way to start a raging chimney fire. So it was that the House of Lords, then the House of Commons, and almost the entire Palace of Westminster - a building as old as the tally stick system itself - was burned to the ground. Perhaps the patron saints of monetary historians were having their revenge.

"This video can not be played The Californian trying to make wine like the French Tech entrepreneur TJ Rodgers made billions of dollars founding silicon chip maker Cypress Semiconductors, now he has turned his sights to wine-making, and is on a quest to make the best Pinot Noir in the New World. A collapse in the roof of a gigantic tunnel being driven into a hillside sounds like a pretty dramatic event. But the entrepreneur TJ Rodgers is calm as he recalls what happened. ""It's not like you see in the movies with rocks flying, and stuff like that. ""It will kill you but it's kind of a slow motion thing, and you can walk [away] and stay in front of it,"" he explains. He is speaking inside one of three giant caves that house his winery high in the Santa Cruz mountains in California. Constructing the wine-making facility took years The construction of the facility was a monumental task, taking years and requiring advice from experts in digging tunnels under the Austrian Alps. Occasional cave-ins were just one of many challenges. The location was so remote that it was impossible for concrete to be driven in without it setting first. Instead, they had to drive in a concrete-making plant which they assembled on site. And the reason for all this intense effort? ""Our mission statement is to make the best Pinot Noir [wine] in the New World,"" says Mr Rodgers. TJ Rodgers became interested in wine in his youth He is certainly not someone to do anything by halves. He founded the huge silicon chip maker Cypress Semiconductors in 1982, and subsequently built it into an enterprise worth billions of dollars. The silicon chips that Cypress makes are found in millions of mobile phones and many other devices. Chips are also found on the bottles produced at the winery, which is called Clos de la Tech. TJ Rodgers, who recently stood down from Cypress, first became interested in wine in his youth. Pinot Noir proved to be his favourite, in particular that made in Burgundy. He wanted to know more, so he travelled to France, visiting vineyard after vineyard in Burgundy. Despite the bemused responses from some vineyard owners, Mr Rodgers says he learnt a lot from his time in France. TJ Rodgers has tried to replicate Burgundy's wine-making process in California's Santa Cruz mountains Back in California, his interest blossomed into a passion. He set about trying to make wine himself, and he enlisted the help of his wife, Valeta Massey, who now spends much of her time on wine-making. Mr Rodgers first experimented with a vineyard at his home. Later, after the purchase of the site in the Santa Cruz mountains, the venture became more ambitious. The plan was to aim for the highest possible quality. The best way to do that, Mr Rodgers decided, was to copy the wine-making process used in Burgundy in the 1830s. This meant using techniques such as foot-crushing the grapes, and being as gentle as possible with the wine at every stage. Pumps are avoided. Instead, the facility is a ""gravity winery"", explains Mr Rodgers. The three enormous caves are arranged one above the other, so after fermentation in the topmost cave the wine flows through pipes downhill into barrels in the second cave for the next stages of the process. Some technology is still involved in the wine-making process Despite the emphasis on traditional methods, technology also plays a role. For example, many real-time measurements are taken during fermentation, and special devices are used to measure moisture levels in the field, helping to ensure the crops get exactly the right amount of water. But Mr Rodgers is quick to add that modern techniques are only used where appropriate: ""the technology is not to supplant the old process, the old guys were pretty smart."" TJ Rodgers is far from the only wealthy individual to try his hand at pushing the boundaries of wine-making in California. But are ventures like his little more than the wine-making equivalent of vanity publishing? Not necessarily, says Aaron Pott, a wine-maker and consultant who has worked at the top end of the industry in France and California. With the right vineyard, and skilled staff, he says, it is perfectly possible to make excellent wine. Mr Pott adds it would also be a mistake to assume that only ancient vines can produce good output. ""Great wine can be made from young vineyards,"" he says. The French oak barrels used at Clos de la Tech cost $1,000 (Â£774; 876 euros) each But while it may be feasible to make high quality wine, making money in the process is more difficult, according to both Mr Rodgers and Mr Pott. For one thing, there is the high cost of setting up facilities like those built by Mr Rodgers and other wealthy people in California. Quite apart from the cost of the land and buildings, the equipment can be expensive. Take, for instance, the French oak barrels used at Clos de la Tech - these cost $1,000  (Â£774; 876 euros) each. Then there is the question of yield. The downside of aiming for high quality, says Mr Rodgers, is that output will be small. ""Our yield up here is one tonne per acre. If you go to a commercial farm in Napa you see five tonnes per acre, and if you go to Modesto you see 12 tonnes per acre. Ok so right there, the war's over with regard to economics. Your wine's going to be expensive,"" he explains. The grape is the most important part of the wine-making process Nevertheless, although economics may present a challenge, benefits can flow from what Mr Rodgers and others like him are doing, says Mr Pott. Whilst in some ways it may make it harder for smaller concerns like his own to compete, Mr Pott believes that the emergence of wealthy wine-makers in California has helped ""to raise the bar"" of quality - and that ultimately is a good thing for the industry. TJ Rodgers and Valeta Massey say they have enjoyed their venture immensely, and that they have learnt a lot about wine in the process. Perhaps the biggest lesson for them has been the prime importance of the starting point - the grape. ""The French have a phrase - 'the wine is made in the field'. ""The wine has a certain potential defined by the grapes in the field andâ¦ the best you can do is take 100 per cent grapes and make 100 per cent wine. And all wine making is downhill from there,"" he says.

"Phillip Harkins has always denied being involved in the robbery in 1999 The European Court of Human Rights has ruled a Scottish man should be tried for murder in the US following a record-breaking extradition battle. It said Phillip Harkins' human rights would not be breached if he was jailed for life without parole in Florida. The 38-year-old has been in jail in the UK since 2003, after being accused over a 1999 drugs-related attempted robbery. He has always denied being involved in the killing and returned to Scotland in 2002 after being released on bail. After his return to the UK, he was convicted and jailed for dangerous driving after killing a 62-year-old woman in a car crash in Greenock. Following that sentence, the US authorities sought his extradition for the 1999 murder of 22-year-old Joshua Hayes - triggering the unprecedented legal battle that has been before the European Court twice. The ruling was made by the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg This has been an unprecedented 14-year extradition battle which has gone on until today. It has been extraordinary. Phillip Harkins has been all the way through the British courts - not once, but twice - and up to the European Court. In essence, he was saying there were two issues. The first was the possibility of the death penalty. The Americans said they wouldn't seek the death penalty in this case if he is convicted. That is a standard procedure which they always offer in British extradition cases. But then Mr Harkins said, well if I'm going to be jailed for life without parole, it is a breach of of my human rights - it's cruel and it's degrading. This has been a long-running row between the European Court and the British authorities about the nature of life sentences. A couple of years ago, even though he had lost his case in Strasbourg, he got a second chance because there was a little bit of doubt in the European Court's mind. That's why he went back today. This morning, he lost. US prosecutors assured the UK that it would not seek the death penalty for Mr Harkins were he to be convicted of the murder. But his lawyers have argued for years that the prospect of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole once reformed constituted inhuman or degrading treatment contrary to the European Convention on Human Rights. Mr Harkins lost all stages of his legal battle in the British courts, and the Strasbourg judges previously ruled against him until a legal twist meant he could try to make a second appeal in 2015. In a short statement on Monday morning, the Grand Chamber of the court said that the case would not be re-opened, meaning it would no longer stand in the way of the extradition. Under the usual procedures, the UK is now expected to inform the US that the extradition can go ahead, so that its authorities can make arrangements to transfer Mr Harkins to American custody. Mr Harkins moved to the US with his family when he was 14. Shortly before his 21st birthday he was accused of shooting dead Joshua Hayes in Jackonsville, Florida, during an attempted robbery. Mr Harkins returned to Scotland after being released on bail in 2002 and was involved in a car crash in his native Greenock, which claimed the life of 62-year-old Jean O'Neill. He was jailed for five years at the High Court in Edinburgh in 2003 after he admitted causing death by dangerous driving. While in custody, Harkins was transferred to Wandsworth Prison in London, while proceedings got under way to extradite him to the US. The final ruling by the European Court has been welcomed by Joshua Hayes' mother Patricia Gallagher. Speaking from her home in Florida, she told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme: ""It's been a long time and he has had appeal after appeal, but the day that he leaves Scotland is the day that we'll believe it's over. ""This has been pure hell - honestly, it's been a fighting battle. We just want to get him back for justice. He should never have been over there - he should have been here. ""I really don't understand how he was ever allowed that many appeals. That's way too many. He says that he's a victim, but he is not.""

"Charlie Gard has been in intensive care since October A lawyer for Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) has dismissed claims of ""fresh"" medical evidence in the case of terminally ill baby Charlie Gard. GOSH referred the case back to the High Court after reports of ""new"" data from foreign healthcare experts suggested treatment could improve his condition. Charlie's parents have made several unsuccessful challenges to a decision to end the 11-month-old's life support. GOSH told the hearing the evidence was not new but it was right to explore it. Mr Justice Francis is overseeing the preliminary hearing in the Family Division of the High Court. In April he ruled that Charlie's life support should be ended and said earlier it would take something ""dramatic and new"" to make him change his mind. Mr Justice Francis is due to resume hearing the case on Thursday. On Sunday, Charlie's parents Chris Gard and Connie Yateshanded in a 350,000-signature petitioncalling for him to travel to the US for treatment. Charlie's parents are seeking permission to remove their son - who has the rare condition mitochondrial depletion syndrome - from the care of Great Ormond Street Hospital so he can undergo experimental treatment abroad. Charlie's medical case explained The judge said: ""There is not a person alive who would not want to save Charlie."" A lawyer for the family said new and unpublished data was recently shared with the hospital that suggested treatment could produce a ""dramatic clinical improvement"" in Charlie's condition. Previously doctors had indicated Charlie had irreversible structural brain damage. Lawyers representing the family have now said using ""cutting edge genetic science"" there was a ""small chance"" of brain recovery and that it was a chance ""worth taking"". They questioned whether Mr Justice Francis was the correct person to assess the latest medical evidence, given that in April he had ruled Charlie's life support should be withdrawn. In reply, the judge said: ""I did my job.  I will continue to do my job."" At the hearing, a lawyer for GOSH said the alleged ""new research"" had been available for the judge's consideration in April and was purely lab-based anyway, and related to patients with muscle problems only rather than brain damage. Charlie inherited the faulty RRM2B gene, affecting the cells responsible for energy production and respiration and leaving him unable to move or breathe without a ventilator. GOSH describes proposed experimental therapies as ""unjustified"" and said the treatments being offered are not a cure. However, the hospital's decision to go back to court came after researchers at two international healthcare facilities said they had ""fresh evidence about their proposed experimental treatment"". Charlie's parents, from Bedfont in west London, want their son to have nucleoside therapy. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Ms Yates described the situation as a ""living hell"". ""I couldn't sit there and watch him in pain and suffering, I promise you I wouldn't,"" she said, adding: ""I think parents know when their children are ready to go and they've given up, and Charlie is still fighting. ""It's horrible that this decision has been taken out of our hands. It's not just about us knowing best, it's about having other hospitals and doctors saying we want to treat [Charlie] and we think it's the best thing to do."" Ms Yates said they were not criticising Great Ormond Street Hospital as ""they do great things"". She said she hoped the judge would take into account new evidence as when the decision was made previously, Charlie's chance was rated at being close to 0% but now this has increased to 10%. Charlie is thought to be one of 16 children in the world to have mitochondrial depletion syndrome. It is a rare genetic condition which causes progressive muscle weakness and brain damage because he is unable to get energy to his organs. Doctors have said he now cannot see, hear, move, cry or swallow and has irreversible brain damage. His lungs are only able to keep going because of the treatment he is receiving. They have argued he should be allowed to die with dignity. But his parents and supporters have been fighting for him to be given an experimental treatment in the US. The treatment is not a cure - there isn't one - but it has been suggested it could reduce the effects of the disease. Although doctors in the US have since said the benefits they have seen have not been in cases as advanced as Charlie's. Charlie's parents have launched a high-profile campaign in the hope of getting their son further treatment abroad US President Donald Trump and the Vatican have supported the parents' campaign for Charlie to be treated abroad, but a leading expert has described interventions from high-profile figures as ""unhelpful"". Prof Neena Modi, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said in an open letter that Charlie's situation was ""heartbreaking"" for his parents, but added that even well-meaning interventions from outsiders could be unhelpful. Mr Gard said: ""If we won the court case and we got to America, and then within the first week of treatment he started suffering and he was in pain, we would let him go. ""This isn't about us. This is about Charlie and giving him the chance he needs."" 3 March 2017: Mr Justice Francis starts to analyse the case at a hearing in the Family Division of the High Court in London 11 April: He says doctors can stop providing life-support treatment 3 May: Charlie's parents ask Court of Appeal judges to consider the case 23 May: Three Court of Appeal judges analyse the case 25 May: Court of Appeal judges dismiss the couple's appeal 8 June: Charlie's parents lose fight in the Supreme Court 20 June: Judges in the European Court of Human Rights start to analyse the case after lawyers representing Charlie's parents make written submissions 27 June: Judges in the European Court of Human Rights refuse to intervene 3 July: The Pope and US President Donald Trump offer to intervene 7 July: Great Ormond Street Hospital applies for a fresh hearing at the High Court Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external Charlie Gard's parents make hospital plea Fresh court bid in Charlie Gard case 'Impossible' to transfer Charlie Gard Pope and Trump offer Charlie Gard support HM Courts Service Great Ormond Street Hospital Walworth Town Hall shows off majestic transformation as it reopens 11 years after horrific fire Lloydâs of London chief executive John Neal to leave for Aon Sadiq Khan's deputy could overturn refusal of 46-storey student tower The World Club returns with the Revive-all repair workshop in Kingston for 2025 Ramraiders steal designer sunglasses worth Â£10k from Hampstead optician The Traitors: How you can get Claudia Winkleman's iconic look on a budget At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles Watch: Ferocious and explosive fire burns behind CBS reporter Liam Payne cause of death confirmed as UK inquest opens Where is Greenland and why does Trump want it?

"This video can not be played Theresa May met her Australian counterpart Malcolm Turnbull in Downing Street Theresa May is to call on rival parties to ""contribute and not just criticise"" as she signals a post-election change in her style of government. In a speech on Tuesday the PM will say she still wants to change the country, but will say that losing her majority means a new approach is needed. Labour says it shows the Conservatives have run out of ideas. But First Secretary of State Damian Green said it was a ""grown-up way of doing politics"". Ministers loyal to Mrs May have dismissed reports of plots to remove her as drink-fuelled ""gossip"", but Labour remains on an election footing, with leader Jeremy Corbyn saying he hopes for a fresh poll in September. Theresa May 'quit' stories blamed on 'warm Prosecco' September election would be nice - Jeremy Corbyn MPs call for 'all options' on Brexit Mrs May will return to the message from her first day in Downing Street last July, when she succeeded David Cameron, and vow to lead what she called a ""one nation"" government that works for all and not just the ""privileged few"". The speech is being seen by some as a ""re-launch"" or ""fightback"" after Mrs May lost her majority - and much of her authority - in the snap election last month. Theresa May's speech is a pitch for cross-party consensus. ""Come forward with your own views and ideas about how we can tackle"" the challenges the country faces, Mrs May will say, adding: ""We may not agree on everything, but ideas can be clarified and improved and a better way forward found."" Bluntly, it is an explicit acknowledgement of her fragility; her authority and majority shrivelled. Government sources say it is a mature approach that maintains a commitment to taking on big, difficult and complex challenges; not just Brexit but reform of social care, too, for instance. Labour says Mrs May's speech proves the Conservatives have ""completely run out of ideas"" and were reduced to ""begging"" for policy proposals from them. In her speech, the PM will say that although the result of June's election was not what she wanted, ""those defining beliefs remain, my commitment to change in Britain is undimmed"". Her ""belief in the potential of the British people and what we can achieve together as a nation remains steadfast, and the determination I have to get to grips with the challenges posed by a changing world never more sure"", she will say. She will unveil a review - of casual and low-paid work - by Matthew Taylor, a former top adviser to Tony Blair, which she commissioned when she became prime minister. Matthew Taylor will publish his employment review on Tuesday It is thought Mr Taylor, who has been examining the use of zero-hours contracts and the rise in app-based firms such as Uber and Deliveroo, will stop short of calling for a compulsory minimum wage for those employed in the so-called gig economy, who do not have guaranteed hours or pay rates. But he is expected to propose a series of extra rights for those in insecure jobs and could also recommend shaking up the tax system to reduce the gap between employees and the self-employed. He is also likely to call for measures to improve job satisfaction for people working in minimum wage jobs,according to The Guardian.,external In her speech, Mrs May will say: ""When I commissioned this report I led a majority government in the House of Commons. The reality I now face as prime minister is rather different. ""In this new context, it will be even more important to make the case for our policies and our values, and to win the battle of ideas both in Parliament as well as in the country. ""So I say to the other parties in the House of Commons... come forward with your own views and ideas about how we can tackle these challenges as a country. ""We may not agree on everything, but through debate and discussion - the hallmarks of our parliamentary democracy - ideas can be clarified and improved and a better way forward found."" This video can not be played The PM has a programme for Britain that will spread prosperity, the first secretary of state tells Today She will acknowledge the fragile nature of her position in the Commons but insist it will not stop her taking ""the bold action necessary to secure a better future"". Speaking at a press conference with Australian counterpart Malcolm Turnbull on Monday, Mrs May said she had sought input from other parties in the past on issues like counter-terrorism and modern slavery. She also said she was happy to work with Labour's Yvette Cooper and others in a cross-party approach to tackling intimidation and online abuse of MPs and others involved in the political process. Asked if her desire for co-operation extended to Brexit, including on the government's Repeal Bill when it is published later this week, the prime minister said she was seeking the ""broadest possible consensus"" surrounding the terms of the UK's exit. But former shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said people would take the calls for cross-party working with ""a lorry load of salt"" - and he questioned why Mrs May had not raised the issue a year ago when she entered Number 10. ""The reason she wasn't asking for it then was she didn't need to,"" he said. Damian Green: This is a grown up way of doing politics Lib Dem Brexit spokesman Tom Brake said: ""A call for Labour to contribute is superfluous. On the single biggest issue of our generation, Brexit, Corbyn isn't contributing, he is cheerleading."" Scottish Government Brexit minister Michael Russell said: ""If the prime minister is genuinely interested in creating a consensus then Scotland should have a seat at the negotiations to leave the EU."" But Mr Green, who has known Mrs May since university and is effectively her deputy prime minister, said the public would welcome a move away from politics in which parties ""just sit in the trenches and shell each other"". ""Politicians of all parties are invited to contribute their ideas - that's a grown up way of doing politics,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He said Mrs May was motivated by ""her duty"" to carry on, adding: ""She still has the same ambitions for this country as she had a year ago and she's determined to put them into practice for the good of this country - that's what drives her."" Asked if the PM could be tempted to step down after her summer holiday, he said: ""No. She thinks not just that it's her duty, but she has a programme for Britain that encompasses not just a good Brexit deal, but also a domestic agenda that will spread prosperity around this country, make this a fairer society, tackle some of the injustices that we still have in our society - and that fire burns within her as strongly as ever."" The BBC's assistant political editor, Norman Smith, said that the Conservatives and Labour were ""poles apart"" on many significant policy areas.

"William Whelton (left) and Joseph Houston are celebrating their first London transfer and their wedding in the same week Two struggling actors who opened their own theatre on a shoestring, doing everything from collecting the tickets to cleaning the toilets, have won a string of awards and are transferring two shows to London. And the theatre's about to host its biggest event yet - their wedding reception. There's a job Joseph Houston and William Whelton shouldn't be doing on the day I meet them in the shabby chic cafe that they've set up in the foyer of their theatre in Manchester. It's been 18 months since the pair cleaned the soot from the floor of the former cotton mill, and since Will's mum tiled the bathrooms and Joseph's grandfather gave the doorframes a lick of paint, after which they threw open the doors to Hope Mill Theatre. They have just finally taken on a cleaner to give the loos a proper once-over. Except today the cleaner has called in sick. ""We still do everything,"" Joseph says. ""Last week was the first day we took on a cleaning service because we thought we would get them in one day a week and at least it makes it a bit easier for us. ""It's only the second time and they've phoned in sick. They should have been cleaned today by someone, but now we're going to have to do it."" Hope Mill Theatre's production of Yank! is now at Charing Cross Theatre Joseph and William are used to multi-tasking - whether that's scrubbing the loos, serving behind the bar, or talking to investors to raise funds to transfer their shows to London. In October, their co-production of the classic musical Hair, which was seen at Hope Mill in 2016, will move to The Vaults underneath Waterloo Station for the show's 50th anniversary. Before that, their staging of Yank!, a musical about two gay US servicemen during World War Two, has transferred to Charing Cross Theatre, where Monday is opening night. Shows like Hair and Yank! have helped Hope Mill make its name since it opened in October 2015. Last October, Joseph and William beat Kenneth Branagh and National Theatre artistic director Rufus Norris to win the theatre prize at the Hospital Club awards. The venue also received two prizes, including a special achievement honour, at the Manchester Theatre Awards in March. Hair will transfer to The Vaults in London in October Joseph and William's biggest celebration is still to come, though. This weekend, the theatre will be transformed into the venue for their wedding reception. The couple met as actors, but their own dreams of West End stardom faded as they struggled to get auditions and as William needed vocal surgery. After having the idea to open their own theatre instead, they spotted an ad for Hope Mill on Gumtree. ""I had proposed to Will on the UK tour of Pirates of Penzance,"" Joseph, 27, says. ""We were going through the process of trying to secure this [building], so we said, well, if we get the venue then we'll get married there."" The couple had been living in London, working as waiters between acting jobs. ""We were struggling to pay the rent, and there was not much happening,"" 28-year-old William says. ""So it makes you lose faith."" Realising that it wasn't worth staying in the capital just to attend occasional auditions, they moved to William's home town of Macclesfield, 20 miles from Manchester. Parade was Hope Mill's first full musical - and ended up selling out As they got to know the city's theatre scene, they realised there might be a gap in the market for a fringe venue where people could see full productions of musicals up close. Hope Mill was modelled on London venues like the Menier Chocolate Factory, Southwark Playhouse and Union Theatre. The pair had worked for the Union's owner Sasha Regan as actors, and she encouraged them to find a venue. ""We were like, 'Well, we don't really have any money,'"" William recalls. ""She said, 'Just do it. You never will.' That gave us the spark and the confidence."" Joseph adds: ""We genuinely didn't have any money. We thought we'd just see what's out there and worry about the money afterwards."" So after finding the building to rent, they drummed up a Â£10,000 Business Finance Solutions loan, a crowdfunding campaign to buy the 120 seats and a loan from William's mum (""Which we still owe her to this day""). The pair ran a crowdfunding campaign and borrowed money from family Their plans soon attracted the attention of theatre producer Katy Lipson, whose company Aria Entertainment has staged shows like The Addams Family musical, and who hails from Manchester. She went to meet the pair before Hope Mill opened. ""She came in one day and we were in overalls painting away,"" Will says. ""It was a total mess but she said, 'What an incredible space.' ""She's used to the kinds of spaces you get in London. Compared to that, this is quite big. She said, 'I'd love to bring some work up here.' In hindsight, she wanted to bring some work back to near home. She'd never produced work in Manchester before."" William and Joseph's ambition of staging full musicals like Yank!, Hair and Parade and taking them to London was part of a five-year plan, but with Lipson's help it has all come to fruition much sooner than expected. The next show the team are staging at Hope Mill is the Tony Award-winning musical Pippin in late August and September. William and Joseph could never have started a venue like this in London, they believe. ""It would have cost way too much,"" William explains. ""The way we opened this place, we pretty much did it on our own with limited funds. ""It was totally naive and pretty stupid when we look back. It so could have gone terribly wrong. But we just soft opened and as money came in we carried on."" The biggest challenge, Joseph reflects, has been learning how to work together. ""That's been hard,"" he says. ""We're a couple, so [we have been] learning what our roles are, learning how to leave work at work and not take it home. ""It doesn't really happen,"" William chips in. ""We take work everywhere we go."" But it's all been worth it, and Joseph says it's ""incredible"" to look back at their achievements over the last 18 months. ""We've had a lot of people who have come on board and really supported us and cheered us,"" he says. ""But ultimately, Will and I have single-handedly set this place up. So there's something very satisfying when someone walks in and goes, 'Wow, this is beautiful', or, 'That show was incredible.'""

"Theresa May's offer to give EU citizens in the UK ""settled status"" after Brexit has been described as being ""far short of what citizens are entitled to"". MEPs, including European Parliament chief Brexit negotiator Guy Verhofstadt say the proposal is a ""damp squib"". It offers Europeans in the UK fewer rights than Britons in the EU, they say in a joint letter to newspapers. Cabinet Office minister Damian Green said the ""basic rights"" of EU citizens living in the UK would be ""preserved"". He urged Mr Verhofstadt to ""read our proposal"", which the UK government insists would allow about three million EU citizens to stay on the same basis as now. EU migrants who had lived in the UK for five years would be granted access to health, education and other benefits. But the prime minister's proposals would be dependent on EU states guaranteeing Britons the same rights. May unveils Brexit offer for EU citizens What is UK offering EU citizens? Britain and EU at odds over citizens' rights The Brexit expats questions Brexit: All you need to know The leaders of the four political groups who have signed the joint letter account for two-thirds of the votes in the European Parliament. Their letter points out that that they have the power to reject any Brexit deal before it can go ahead because the parliament must approve the withdrawal agreement. This video can not be played Guy Verhofstadt says the European Parliament is unhappy with the current UK plans The leaders said they would not endorse anything that removed rights already acquired by citizens. They said the UK proposal ""falls short"" because it would take away rights citizens currently have, and create new red tape and uncertainty for millions of people. The letter said this contradicted promises made by the Leave campaign that EU citizens would be treated no less favourably after Brexit. By contrast, the letter said the EU's offer - already on the table - was simple, clear and fair because it promised that all citizens, including UK nationals living in Europe, would be treated equally and lose no current rights. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Verhofstadt said EU citizens in the UK - and Britons living on the continent - should keep their current rights, rather than the government ""inventing a new status"". What the UK is offering EU citizens? All EU nationals lawfully resident for at least five years will be able to apply for ""settled status"" and be able to bring over spouses and children. Those granted settled status will be able to live, work, study and claim benefits just as they can now EU nationals in the UK for less than five years will be able to continue living and working in the UK Once resident for five years, they will be able to apply for settled status Those arriving after an as yet confirmed cut-off point will be able to stay temporarily in order to ""regularise their status"" but with no guarantees EU citizens who are already permanent residents will need to re-apply British courts will have jurisdiction over enforcing rights In full:Safeguarding the position,externalof EU citizens What is the EU offering UK citizens? All British citizens lawfully resident in the EU at the time of Brexit will be able to stay, even if they don't have residency documents Their existing rights, and those of family members, will be fully protected during their lifetimes British citizens will receive equal treatment, enforceable by the European Court of Justice Existing rules on access to benefits, healthcare and education will be protected Students will be able to work after graduating without having to comply with third-country immigration laws In full: EU'sessential principles,externalon citizens' rights ""It creates a type of second class citizenship for European Citizens in the UK,"" he added. ""We don't see why their rights should be diminished and that would be the case in the proposal. ""In the end, it is the European Parliament that will say yes or no, and I can tell you it not will be a yes if the rights of European citizens - and also the rights of UK citizens living on the continent - will be diminished [and] cut off, like it is at the moment."" Guy Verhofstadt says the EU's offer - already on the table - is simple, clear and fair The letter stated: ""The European Parliament will reserve its right to reject any agreement that treats EU citizens, regardless of their nationality, less favourably than they are at present. ""This is a question of the basic fundamental rights and values that are at the heart of the European project."" It added: ""In early 2019, MEPs will have a final say on the Brexit deal. We will work closely with the EU negotiator and the 27 member states to help steer negotiations."" A spokesperson for the UK government said the letter contained a ""number of inaccuracies"" which could cause unnecessary and needless concern to UK and EU citizens. Mr Green, who as first secretary of state is a close ally of Theresa May's, told BBC Radio 4's Today that it was clear that EU citizens would have to comply with ""basic"" immigration rules after the UK leaves the EU to establish their identity and nationality. But he insisted: ""That is not an insuperable barrier. We all fill in forms when we go on holiday and have to get visas and all that."" He suggested the UK was doing ""precisely"" what the EU was calling for. ""Somebody who is here now will keep the rights they already have and we hope that British citizens living in other EU countries will keep the rights they already have...the basic rights will be preserved so that should not be an obstacle to a final deal.""

"Australia's cigarette plain packaging has been adopted elsewhere Tobacco giant Philip Morris has been ordered to pay the Australian government millions of dollars after unsuccessfully suing the nation over its world-first plain-packaging laws. In 2012, Australia legislated that cigarettes must be sold in unappealing packets with graphic health warnings. Philip Morris had tried toforce the lawsto be overturned, but a court dismissed its claim in 2015. The tobacco giant has now been ordered to pay the government's legal costs. The exact sum was redacted from the international Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA)decision,external, but the Sydney Morning Heraldreported,externalit was as high as A$50m (Â£30m; $38m). In May, Bloomberg reported that the World Trade Organization (WTO) had decided Australia's laws were a legitimatepublic health measure- making them more likely to be adopted overseas. After plain packaging was introduced, Philip Morris, Imperial Tobacco and Japan Tobacco launched a constitutional challenge in Australia's highest court. When that bid failed, Philip Morris went to the PCA to claim the legislation breached Australia's Bilateral Investment Treaty with Hong Kong. How Australia is stubbing out smoking Plain packs 'may cut smokers by 300,000' It sought an end to plain packaging, or billions of dollars in compensation. The court dismissed the company's case, calling it ""an abuse of rights"". Philip Morris then argued the government's claim for legal costs was unreasonable, saying it was well above claims made by Canada ($4.5m) and the US ($3m) in comparable cases. However, the court ruled the costs were reasonable because they did ""not go beyond what is usual in other investment cases"". It also acknowledged the ""significant stakes involved"" regarding public health. This video can not be played Under the new law, brand names will appear in the same position, font, size and colour on packets The document, marked 8 March 2017, was only made publicly available on the weekend.

"Thousands of civilians have died as a result of air strikes in the Yemen civil war UK government arms sales to Saudi Arabia are lawful, the High Court has ruled, after seeing secret evidence. The court rejected campaigners' claims ministers were acting illegally by not suspending weapon sales to the kingdom, which is fighting a war in Yemen. The UN claims strikes on Houthi rebels caused thousands of civilian deaths. The government said defence exports would continue to be reviewed but the Campaign Against the Arms Trade said an appeal against the ruling was planned. The group had claimed the UK has contravened humanitarian law, and it attacked the refusal of the Secretary of State for International Trade to suspend export licences for the sale or transfer of arms and military equipment. Lord Justice Burnett and Mr Justice Haddon-Cave, sitting in London, said the decision to carry on the arms trade was not unlawful. The judges said ""closed material"", which had not been made public for national security reasons, ""provides valuable additional support for the conclusion that the decisions taken by the secretary of state not to suspend or cancel arms sales to Saudi Arabia were rational"". Equipment sold to Saudi Arabia includes Typhoon and Tornado fighter jets, as well as precision-guided bombs. The sales contribute to thousands of engineering jobs in the UK, and have provided billions of pounds of revenue for the British arms trade. Saudi Arabia has been supporting Yemen's internationally-recognised government after a civil war broke out in 2015. Yemen crisis: Who is fighting whom? Houthi rebels, loyal to deposed president Ali Abdullah Saleh, began an attack in 2014, forcing leader Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to flee the country for a time. Since then the Saudi kingdom, and eight other mostly Sunni Arab states, have supported an air campaign aimed at restoring Mr Hadi's government. Andrew Smith, of Campaign Against Arms Trade, said: ""This is a very disappointing verdict, and we are pursuing an appeal. ""If this verdict is upheld then it will be seen as a green light for government to continue arming and supporting brutal dictatorships and human rights abusers like Saudi Arabia that have shown a blatant disregard for international humanitarian law. ""Every day we are hearing new and horrifying stories about the humanitarian crisis that has been inflicted on the people of Yemen."" Rosa Curling, of law firm Leigh Day, which represented the campaign group, said: ""Nothing in the open evidence, presented by the UK government to the court, suggests this risk does not exist in relation to arms to Saudi Arabia. ""Indeed, all the evidence we have seen from Yemen suggests the opposite: the risk is very real. You need only look at the devastating reality of the situation there."" James Lynch, Amnesty International's head of arms control and human rights, said the ruling was ""deeply disappointing"". ""Irrespective of this ruling, the UK and other governments should end their shameless arms supplies to Saudi Arabia,"" he said. ""They may amount to lucrative trade deals, but the UK risks aiding and abetting these terrible crimes."" The government said UK defence exports would continue to be ""under careful review"" to ensure they meet the standards of the Consolidated EU and National Arms Export Licensing Criteria. ""We welcome this judgment, which underscores the fact that the UK operates one of the most robust export control regimes in the world,"" a spokesperson said.

"This video can not be played 'Peter' says he now drinks ""a bottle of spirits a day"" Two prison officers have spoken to the Victoria Derbyshire programme about the reality of working inside prisons in England and Wales in order, they say, to expose the problems the service is facing. Their identities have been changed. Alan worked for two years in a privately run prison before leaving last year. ""Officers are being assaulted, punched, boiling water poured in their faces - on a regular basis. ""I was punched, then excrement thrown in my face. He'd basically put excrement in a bag, he ran up behind me and shoved it in my face. Eyes, nose, mouth. ""It was the worst feeling in the world, we don't know their medical records.... the next day I was in the local hospital waiting for all the tests to see if I had contracted anything. ""In my opinion you've seen nothing yet. It's going to boil over very soon."" Peter has worked for more than 20 years in the service. ""Today I was on a shift, before I left we had a member of staff who ended up with a broken nose, a potential broken wrist and a potential broken finger. ""I've been on the end of a bad experience, a few years back, and that still lives with me. It never goes away. We attended a cell with two prisoners in it. We were dealing with their issues when they assaulted us. They used the leg of a metal chair to assault myself and my colleagues. ""There was a mass brawl on the floor, you don't know what or who is connected to who or what. And you try to do your best at that moment in time. I'd done some internal damage to my shoulder and required a couple of operations. ""It's only a matter of time before something massive goes off and either lots of prisoners will get hurt or lots of prison officers will get hurt. It will get to the stage where a prison officer will get killed on duty."" Synthetic drugs are a growing problem in England's prisons Alan: ""When I started, this drug known as spice, you'd have an incident a week, maybe two, very rare. But just before I left, you'd have three or four a day. Regular, regular, ambulances called to deal with a spice attack. We just couldn't control it, it literally got out of hand."" Peter: ""Prisoners are specifically now going out and doing a crime to be recalled as they can earn more money coming in with drugs, mobiles and Sim cards. That never happened 20 years ago."" Alan: ""They [the prisoners] spoke openly about friends and gang members getting caught for petty crimes, receiving two-year sentences, because they know when they get in there's quite a strong drug feed. They were talking about making several thousand pounds a month through selling drugs in prison."" ""Alan"" left his role in a privately run prison last year Peter: ""I was joining a service I was proud to join. Twenty years ago, you had time with prisoners. Time to engage, time to help them try and see that their actions were wrong. But now we haven't got the staff, we haven't got the time and we have prisoners who don't really care about changing their lives."" Alan: ""After the training - eight or nine weeks in total, you're on the wings and that's it. There's a massive sick rate and they're struggling to cover the wings. There were times, and I certainly wasn't on my own, when you were left to lock 64 prisoners behind the doors. ""I've seen it first hand where a prisoner has attacked another prisoner with a razor blade over a packet of tobacco. If you're on your own and you see something like that, which we did, you could be trying to split 15 to 20 blokes up."" Peter: ""We're getting officers who are 20, 21 years of age, what experience have they got of life? And they're telling a 40, 50-year-old to go behind the door, who's probably done 10 years already. There's no respect, no authority and no discipline."" Alan: ""I used to wake up in the morning and feel physically sick. When you've got a prisoner, he's threatening to rip your head off, he's going to stab you, he's going to get your kid shot, your missus shot, you don't know his capabilities."" Peter: ""I didn't drink before. But I drink most days just to get through. When I'm on holiday, I'm fine. [I drink] a lot, too much. Probably a bottle of spirits a night. Then we get up in the morning and pretend nothing is wrong as we have to put on a front."" A Ministry of Justice spokeswoman said it was ""committed to building on the essential reforms that are already under way to make prisons places of safety and reform. ""In November last year, we announced a major overhaul of the prison system, including 2,500 extra front-line officers and new measures to tackle violence, drugs and mobile phones,"" she added.

"At least 80 people are believed to have died in the fire in the Kensington tower block ""In those first few days, I couldn't sleep at all. I couldn't stop thinking about the tower and I couldn't stop thinking about the people in need."" Chahine, who lives near Grenfell Tower in north Kensington, is one of a team of local volunteers working with the NHS to help residents struggling to deal with the psychological impact ofthe fire that killed at least 80 people. He has been visiting people who were affected and making sure they are aware of the services available to them. ""I live in a tower too. It was like, 'that could have been me, that could have been my neighbours',"" Chahine adds. ""I think the mental health side of things is an issue that is going to last much longer than, say, the housing issue."" Chahine believes the mental health issue could have long-lasting consequences Medical evidence suggests symptoms of serious post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) often only surface four to six weeks after an incident. Three weeks on from the Grenfell Tower fire, local doctors report that many people are continuing to suffer ""acute stress"". ""We're seeing lots of patients coming in who are now obviously displaced, living in hotels and B&Bs all around - and it's starting to have an effect on them now, in terms of anxiety symptoms, not being able to sleep at night,"" says local GP Dr Oisin Bannick, who co-ordinated the first response on the morning following the fire. ""I've had patients in who wake up at night-time hearing the screaming from the building and it's very, very distressing for these patients."" His colleague, Dr Ahmed Kazmi, who lost 11 patients in the fire, said that while 10-30% of the population were likely to develop PTSD after any similar event, the make-up of the local population put his patients at particular risk. ""When you look at some of the factors for an event, that make PTSD more likely to arise from that, Grenfell has a lot of those factors -  so, for example, man-made, involves children, lasted several hours, was unexpected - these are all features in an event that mean PTSD rates are likely to be higher."" He suggested practical matters, such as rehousing, can also play a vital part in the recovery process.

Weather services say 49.2mm fell in one hour, the French capital's heaviest July deluge on record. Flooding closed 20 metro stations and three were still shut as commuters made their way to work on Monday morning. Parts of Switzerland were hit by violent winds and hail storms that also caused flooding at the weekend.

While Montsouris park on the southern edge of central Paris recorded 68mm in 24 hours, the western French village of Civray saw 86mm. Forecaster Patrick Galois said that radar images suggested the central-western regions of Poitou, Berry and the northern Limousin could easily top 100mm in a matter of hours. A dozen storm alerts were in force on Monday as the weather front moved east. Heavy rain continued to lash Paris as firefighters rehearsed for Friday's Bastille Day military parade The Paris fire brigade recorded 1,700 emergency calls and responded to 87 incidents, including one in the basement of the culture ministry.

"Smoke billowed over Mosul on Sunday as airstrikes against the Islamic State (IS) group continued Even while the Iraqi prime minister was on his way to Mosul to declare the liberation of the city, there was still the occasional sound of gunfire and coalition warplanes flying overhead. Earlier in the morning we saw a number of airstrikes in the Old City. Iraqi forces were still pinned down by snipers from the group that calls itself Islamic State. Colonel Jabbar Abad told us it was the last pocket of resistance. He claimed they would be defeated within hours. His troops helped a steady stream of civilians fleeing to safety. Mostly women and children. Their faces were haunted and some had to be helped. The children didn't even flinch when there was more sound of gunfire. An older woman was so weak she could barely walk. A few babies being carried looked almost lifeless. Children in Mosul have been prisoners of IS for much of their short lives The families were given food and water. This, their first taste of freedom after three years of living under IS control. The battle briefly forgotten in their own fight for survival. If this is victory it has come at a huge cost. Not just in human life. Nearly everyone rescued had to leave dead relatives behind. Almost every building in the old city has been scarred or completely destroyed. This video can not be played 'The is still a lot of misery in Mosul' Search and rescue teams are still pulling bodies from the rubble. The heat has contributed to the stench of decaying corpses. We met Ali, who had come to find his brother's family. Hoping against hope that some may have survived. He said IS fighters had been using their house when it was hit by a coalition airstrike a few weeks ago. Iraqi security forces had only recently taken the area. Battle for Mosul: The story so far After Mosul: The Iraqi towns still under IS control With tears streaming down his face, Ali held up his mobile phone and told me he'd spoken to his brother trapped under the rubble. But over the last few days there had been no reply. Ali helped the search and rescue teams make their way through the tonnes of rubble. They tried to console him when all they could find was what must have been their remains, which they carried off in a black zipped bag. We watched them do the same at several other sites. Ali is among those searching for loved ones in the rubble Contrast that with the jubilation of the Iraqi security forces who mobbed Prime Minister Abadi as he arrived in the city to declare victory over IS. This is still a significant moment. The extremists have held the city for three years. It's taken nine months of brutal street to street fighting to dislodge them. This was their stronghold in Iraq. It was here, in the city's now flattened Great Mosque of al-Nuri, where their leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, made his one and only public appearance as Caliph of their so-called state. Where is IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi? Why Mosulâs Great Mosque of al-Nuri mattered For many IS fighters Mosul is their graveyard, though it is still likely that some have escaped. The misery of Mosul is far from over. The UN estimates it will cost at least $1bn (Â£0.77bn) to restore the city's basic infrastructure - such as clean water and electricity. It will take tens of billions more to rebuild this city.

"Donald Trump Jr said ""no meaningful information"" on Mrs Clinton was provided US President Donald Trump's son has admitted meeting a Russian lawyer last year who, he says, promised to reveal damaging material on Hillary Clinton. But Donald Trump Jr insisted that Natalia Veselnitskaya had provided ""no meaningful information"" on his father's rival for the presidency. The president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and then-campaign head, Paul J Manafort, were also at the meeting. US officials are investigating alleged Russian meddling in the US election. Who's who in the Trump clan Jared Kushner's dizzying array of portfolios Russia: The cloud over the White House It took place on 9 June 2016 at New York's Trump Tower, just two weeks after Donald Trump secured the Republican nomination. It is thought to be the first confirmed private meeting between a Russian national and members of President Trump's inner circle. After theNew York Times,externalfirst reported the meeting on Saturday, Mr Trump Jr released a statement which confirmed that it had taken place but did not mention whether it was related to the presidential campaign. However,another Times report,external, on Sunday, said Mr Trump Jr had agreed to the meeting after being offered information that would potentially prove detrimental to Mrs Clinton. The paper cited three White House advisers briefed on the meeting, and two others with knowledge for it, as its sources. Mr Trump Jr said that an acquaintance he had known from the 2013 Miss Universe pageant had set up the meeting. TheWashington Post,externalconfirmed that figure to be music publicist Rob Goldstone, who has links to the Russian music industry. In a statement,externalon Sunday, Mr Trump Jr said he had been asked to meet ""an individual who I was told might have information helpful to the campaign"". ""I was not told her name prior to the meeting. I asked Jared [Kushner] and Paul [Manafort] to attend, but told them nothing of the substance."" Mr Trump Jr's statement continues: ""After pleasantries were exchanged, the woman stated that she had information that individuals connected to Russia were funding the Democratic National Committee and supporting Mrs Clinton. ""Her statements were vague, ambiguous and made no sense. No details or supporting information was provided or even offered. It quickly became clear that she had no meaningful information. ""She then changed subjects and began discussing the adoption of Russian children and mentioned the Magnitsky Act. ""It became clear to me that this was the true agenda all along and that the claims of potentially helpful information were a pretext for the meeting."" Ms Veselnitskaya said on Saturday that ""nothing at all was discussed about the presidential campaign"" and insisted she had ""never acted on behalf of the Russian government and have never discussed any of these matters with any representative of the Russian government"". On Monday, Mr Trump Jrtweeted,externalsarcastically: ""Obviously I'm the first person on a campaign to ever take a meeting to hear info about an opponent..."" He alsodenied,externalissuing conflicting statements. And helinked,externalto a piece in the New York Post headlined ""The Times 'exposÃ©' on Donald Trump Jr is a big yawn"". Adopted by Congress in 2012, the act allows the US to withhold visas and freeze financial assets of Russian officials thought to have been involved in human rights violations. It is named after a Moscow lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky, who had accused Russian officials of tax fraud but was himself arrested and died in police custody. The US law so incensed President Vladimir Putin that he suspended a programme allowing Americans to adopt Russian children. Ms Veselnitskaya is a lawyer whose clients include companies and individuals said to be close to the Kremlin, and she has been at the forefront of a campaign - backed by the Russian state - to overturn the Magnitsky Act. Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov insisted the Kremlin had no idea who she was: ""We cannot keep a close watch on the meetings of all Russian lawyers inside the country and abroad."" Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter If it walks like collusion and talks like collusion... what exactly is it? For the first time there appears to be direct evidence that three individuals in US President Donald Trump's inner circle met with a well-connected Russian prior to the presidential election where the campaign - including the possibility of damaging information about Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton - was discussed. Donald Trump Jr has denied that anything relevant came out of the meeting but that could be beside the point. Intent is key and this may end up just one piece of a particularly unseemly puzzle. This is also troubling news for the two other principals involved - son-in-law Jared Kushner and campaign chair Paul J Manafort - who are both embroiled in their own Russia-related controversies. In May the president insisted that he had not colluded with the Russians. ""But I can only speak for myself,"" he said. Some in his administration may have swallowed hard at that line - and now three individuals, if the New York Times is right, are leaking dynamite to the press. Try as they might, the Trump team cannot seem to escape this Russia-related vortex. It makes one wonder what grim reality spins beneath the surface, pulling everyone down. Read Anthony's full piece Mr Kushner and Mr Manafort have not commented, although Mr Kushner's lawyer said her client had previously disclosed the meeting on security clearance forms. Mr Manafort has disclosed the meeting to congressional investigators. Jared Kushner has not yet commented on the Donald Trump Jr statement A spokesman for President Trump's legal team said on Sunday that the president was ""not aware of and did not attend"" the meeting. White House chief of staff Reince Priebus said the meeting was a ""big nothing burger"". The Times said Mr Trump Jr had told the paper in March that he had not met any Russian nationals to discuss campaign-related matters. It is alleged that Russian hackers stole information linked to the Clinton campaign and passed it to Wikileaks so it could be released and help tip the election towards Mr Trump. Congressional committees and a special prosecutor are investigating whether there was any collusion between the Trump team and the Russians. The investigations have yet to reveal any evidence of collusion, something the president has always denied.

"Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin had their first face-to-face talks on Friday Donald Trump has backtracked on a proposal to work with Russia to create an ""impenetrable"" cybersecurity unit to prevent election hacking. Hours after promoting the idea on Sunday, the US president said that he did not think it could actually happen. The idea of a partnership with Russia was ridiculed by senior Republicans. It comes after Mr Trump's first face-to-face talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Germany on Friday, in which the pair discussed the issue. Mr Trump described the outcome of the talks as positive and suggested closer co-operation between the two nations. ""Putin and I discussed forming an impenetrable cybersecurity unit so that election hacking, and many other negative things, will be guarded and safe,"" he said. The initial proposal immediately prompted derision from Democrats, as well as some Republicans who questioned why the US would work with Russia after the Kremlin's alleged meddling in the 2016 US election. Mr Trump shifted his position on Sunday night. ""The fact that President Putin and I discussed a cybersecurity unit doesn't mean I think it can happen. It can't,"" hetweeted,external. However, he stressed that another issue discussed in his talks with Mr Putin, a ceasefire in south-western Syria, had come into effect. Russia: The 'cloud' over the White House Donald Trump Jr met Russian lawyer US official says Russia 'hacked' election in 21 states The ins and outs of the Trump Russia scandal Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin had sought to defend the proposed cyber unit after Mr Trump's initial announcement. Speaking on ABC's This Week programme, he described it as a ""significant accomplishment"" for Mr Trump. ""What we want to make sure is that we co-ordinate with Russia,"" he added. However, Republican Senator Marco Rubio suggested that such an initiative would be like partnering with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad on chemical weapons. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said: ""It's not the dumbest idea I've ever heard, but it's pretty close."" This video can not be played Trump to Putin: ""It's an honour to be with you"" A special prosecutor is investigating whether Trump associates colluded with alleged Russian efforts to influence the 2016 US election. Both Mr  Trump and Mr Putin said the allegations had been discussed. However, the two sides described the content of the meeting differently. Mr Trump said he ""strongly pressed"" the issue with Mr Putin, who had ""vehemently denied,external"" interfering in the US election. He also said it was time to work more ""constructively"" with Russia. President Putin said he believed President Trump had accepted his assurances that Moscow had not interfered in the vote. However, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said interference in the 2016 election remained an impediment to better relations with Russia, while the US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, said the US ""can't trust Russia"" and ""won't ever trust Russia"".

"Deliveroo's takeaway food riders could be in line for the minimum wage A government review of the rapidly changing world of work is to demand a radical overhaul of employment law and new guarantees on the minimum wage. The review is set to call for a new category of worker called a ""dependent contractor"". Those workers - likely to cover riders for firms like Deliveroo and Uber - should receive benefits such as sick pay and holiday leave, it will say. And they will be covered by some of the minimum wage requirements. This will help clear up the present grey area between a fully employed and a self-employed person - presently called a ""worker"" in employment law. The review by Matthew Taylor, the head of the Royal Society of Arts and a former Tony Blair adviser, will outline a structure obliging firms to show that a person working for them can earn at least 1.2 times the present national living wage of Â£7.50 an hour for over-25s. The companies will do that by modelling the number of tasks - or ""gigs"" - an average person working at an average rate can achieve. An estimated 1.1 million people work in the gig economy. I understand the review, due to be published on Tuesday, has looked at the agriculture sector where ""piece work"" calculations - how much a crop picker can pick in an hour, for example - work in a similar way. The review has seen evidence that hourly rates in the sector are set at 1.2 times the national minimum wage. The review will call for the new ""dependent contractor"" payment system to be overseen by the Low Pay Commission, the official body which sets the minimum wage. Gig economy workers 'should get minimum wage' Deliveroo moves on benefits for riders What is the gig economy? The review of the new world of work - set up by Theresa May before the last election - has also looked positively at models where gig workers can log on at any time and see ""real time"" earnings potential. If the company can only offer enough work to earn, say, Â£5 an hour, because it is a quiet period, then it is up to the gig worker whether they accept that rate. They would not subsequently be able to take action against the gig company for not paying the minimum wage, the review will suggest. Uber drivers could be classed as 'dependent contractors' Sources have told me that Mr Taylor and his review panel have been impressed by how many gig firms have transformed the economy both for workers and for consumers. But Mr Taylor wants to ensure that the relationship between the worker and the digital platform firm is a fair one, offering ""two-way flexibility"" so that workers receive benefits while at the same time retaining the ability to work when they want. Firms like Uber, Deliveroo and CitySprint at present insist that their drivers and riders are self-employed and therefore can work when they want. In return for that flexibility, the workers do not receive the same benefits as full-time employees, such as the guaranteed minimum wage, sick pay, holiday entitlement and pension provision. The companies also avoid paying national insurance contributions for the people who work for them. They have been criticised for exploiting the law on ""self-employment"" to keep costs down. Though firms like Deliveroo point out that their riders earn on average between Â£9.50 and Â£10 an hour - well above the minimum wage. Critics say their model also undermines the government's tax base as self-employed people pay lower taxes than the fully employed. A report by the Trades Union Congress suggested that the Treasury could be losing up to Â£4bn a year in revenue due to the rapid growth of ""insecure"" work. Last week Will Shu, the founder and chief executive of Deliveroo, told me he wanted to offer a wider range of benefits to delivery riders but believed that he was constrained by present-day employment law, which hedescribed as ""out of date"". This video can not be played Mr Shu says the law needs to change to catch up with the modern economy In the BBC interview, Mr Shu said the company would consider paying holiday and pension rights as well as sickness and injury benefits if the law changed. Sources say that Mr Taylor's report will not name firms but will recognise that the gig economy has raised challenges for the way employment law works. Uber and the courier firm CitySprint have lost court cases over whether their drivers are truly self-employed or are in fact ""workers"" who are employed largely by one firm, and therefore should receive more rights. Turning down work is often not seen as an option by riders and drivers. It is this category which will become ""dependent contractors"" if the review's recommendations are implemented. It could also mean gig firms are obliged to pay national insurance contributions, which they avoid at the moment. The report goes far wider than the ""gig"" economy, and also looks at the quality of work on offer. In anearlier interviewwith me, Mr Taylor said that the UK had been very good at creating a large number of jobs - which was an economic good - and that now the question was how to make those jobs of a high, and rewarding, quality. The report will say that the quality of work and enhancing skills should be at the heart of the debate on employment in the UK. Controversies such as the overuse of zero-hours contracts, for example, also have to be tackled, it will say. But it will not back Labour's policy of banning zero-hours contracts, saying they are useful for some forms of work where demand fluctuates rapidly, such as organising conferences or in the retail sector.

Ms Veselnitskaya is a lawyer whose clients include companies and individuals said to be close to the Kremlin, and she has been at the forefront of a campaign - backed by the Russian state - to overturn the Magnitsky Act. Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov insisted the Kremlin had no idea who she was: ""We cannot keep a close watch on the meetings of all Russian lawyers inside the country and abroad."" Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter If it walks like collusion and talks like collusion... what exactly is it? For the first time there appears to be direct evidence that three individuals in US President Donald Trump's inner circle met with a well-connected Russian prior to the presidential election where the campaign - including the possibility of damaging information about Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton - was discussed. Donald Trump Jr has denied that anything relevant came out of the meeting but that could be beside the point. Intent is key and this may end up just one piece of a particularly unseemly puzzle. This is also troubling news for the two other principals involved - son-in-law Jared Kushner and campaign chair Paul J Manafort - who are both embroiled in their own Russia-related controversies. In May the president insisted that he had not colluded with the Russians. ""But I can only speak for myself,"" he said. Some in his administration may have swallowed hard at that line - and now three individuals, if the New York Times is right, are leaking dynamite to the press. Try as they might, the Trump team cannot seem to escape this Russia-related vortex. It makes one wonder what grim reality spins beneath the surface, pulling everyone down. Read Anthony's full piece Mr Kushner and Mr Manafort have not commented, although Mr Kushner's lawyer said her client had previously disclosed the meeting on security clearance forms. Mr Manafort has disclosed the meeting to congressional investigators. Jared Kushner has not yet commented on the Donald Trump Jr statement A spokesman for President Trump's legal team said on Sunday that the president was ""not aware of and did not attend"" the meeting. White House chief of staff Reince Priebus said the meeting was a ""big nothing burger"". The Times said Mr Trump Jr had told the paper in March that he had not met any Russian nationals to discuss campaign-related matters. It is alleged that Russian hackers stole information linked to the Clinton campaign and passed it to Wikileaks so it could be released and help tip the election towards Mr Trump. Congressional committees and a special prosecutor are investigating whether there was any collusion between the Trump team and the Russians. The investigations have yet to reveal any evidence of collusion, something the president has always denied. Last weekMr Trump saidinterference in the election ""could well have been"" carried out by countries other than Russia and interference ""has been happening for a long time"".

"Theresa May's offer to give EU citizens in the UK ""settled status"" after Brexit has been described as being ""far short of what citizens are entitled to"". MEPs, including European Parliament chief Brexit negotiator Guy Verhofstadt say the proposal is a ""damp squib"". It offers Europeans in the UK fewer rights than Britons in the EU, they say in a joint letter to newspapers. Cabinet Office minister Damian Green said the ""basic rights"" of EU citizens living in the UK would be ""preserved"". He urged Mr Verhofstadt to ""read our proposal"", which the UK government insists would allow about three million EU citizens to stay on the same basis as now. EU migrants who had lived in the UK for five years would be granted access to health, education and other benefits. But the prime minister's proposals would be dependent on EU states guaranteeing Britons the same rights. May unveils Brexit offer for EU citizens What is UK offering EU citizens? Britain and EU at odds over citizens' rights The Brexit expats questions Brexit: All you need to know The leaders of the four political groups who have signed the joint letter account for two-thirds of the votes in the European Parliament. Their letter points out that that they have the power to reject any Brexit deal before it can go ahead because the parliament must approve the withdrawal agreement. This video can not be played Guy Verhofstadt says the European Parliament is unhappy with the current UK plans The leaders said they would not endorse anything that removed rights already acquired by citizens. They said the UK proposal ""falls short"" because it would take away rights citizens currently have, and create new red tape and uncertainty for millions of people. The letter said this contradicted promises made by the Leave campaign that EU citizens would be treated no less favourably after Brexit. By contrast, the letter said the EU's offer - already on the table - was simple, clear and fair because it promised that all citizens, including UK nationals living in Europe, would be treated equally and lose no current rights. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Verhofstadt said EU citizens in the UK - and Britons living on the continent - should keep their current rights, rather than the government ""inventing a new status"". What the UK is offering EU citizens? All EU nationals lawfully resident for at least five years will be able to apply for ""settled status"" and be able to bring over spouses and children. Those granted settled status will be able to live, work, study and claim benefits just as they can now EU nationals in the UK for less than five years will be able to continue living and working in the UK Once resident for five years, they will be able to apply for settled status Those arriving after an as yet confirmed cut-off point will be able to stay temporarily in order to ""regularise their status"" but with no guarantees EU citizens who are already permanent residents will need to re-apply British courts will have jurisdiction over enforcing rights In full:Safeguarding the position,externalof EU citizens What is the EU offering UK citizens? All British citizens lawfully resident in the EU at the time of Brexit will be able to stay, even if they don't have residency documents Their existing rights, and those of family members, will be fully protected during their lifetimes British citizens will receive equal treatment, enforceable by the European Court of Justice Existing rules on access to benefits, healthcare and education will be protected Students will be able to work after graduating without having to comply with third-country immigration laws In full: EU'sessential principles,externalon citizens' rights ""It creates a type of second class citizenship for European Citizens in the UK,"" he added. ""We don't see why their rights should be diminished and that would be the case in the proposal. ""In the end, it is the European Parliament that will say yes or no, and I can tell you it not will be a yes if the rights of European citizens - and also the rights of UK citizens living on the continent - will be diminished [and] cut off, like it is at the moment."" Guy Verhofstadt says the EU's offer - already on the table - is simple, clear and fair The letter stated: ""The European Parliament will reserve its right to reject any agreement that treats EU citizens, regardless of their nationality, less favourably than they are at present. ""This is a question of the basic fundamental rights and values that are at the heart of the European project."" It added: ""In early 2019, MEPs will have a final say on the Brexit deal. We will work closely with the EU negotiator and the 27 member states to help steer negotiations."" A spokesperson for the UK government said the letter contained a ""number of inaccuracies"" which could cause unnecessary and needless concern to UK and EU citizens. Mr Green, who as first secretary of state is a close ally of Theresa May's, told BBC Radio 4's Today that it was clear that EU citizens would have to comply with ""basic"" immigration rules after the UK leaves the EU to establish their identity and nationality. But he insisted: ""That is not an insuperable barrier. We all fill in forms when we go on holiday and have to get visas and all that."" He suggested the UK was doing ""precisely"" what the EU was calling for. ""Somebody who is here now will keep the rights they already have and we hope that British citizens living in other EU countries will keep the rights they already have...the basic rights will be preserved so that should not be an obstacle to a final deal.""

"There were 31,467 cancers diagnosed in Scotland in 2015 A cancer diagnosis is one of the most common life-changing events in Scottish life, with more cases than marriages or first births, the latest figures show. Macmillan Cancer Support said there were 31,467 cancers diagnosed in 2015 compared with 29,691 marriages and 23,695 first births. Cancer was also named as the disease people in Scotland most feared, ahead of conditions such as Alzheimer's. The research is part of a campaign to remove the fear of a cancer diagnosis. The figures showed that - excluding non-melanoma skin cancer - there were just over 1,700 more new cases of cancer each year in Scotland than new marriages or 8,000 more cases than women having a child for the first time. The number of people with cancer in Scotlandhas risen by 18% in five years, according to Macmillan. Across the UK, Cancer Research UK says there has been a12% rise since the 1990s,external, with rates among woman up by 16% and 4% for men. Macmillan said as well as trying to remove the fear of a cancer diagnosis, its Life With Cancer campaign aimed to highlight the support available to people with the disease. Of the Scots asked, 41% said they feared getting cancer over any other disease, while one in eight said cancer was scarier than terrorism or losing a loved one. Trisha Hatt, Macmillan's partnership manager in Scotland, said: ""This research highlights that for many people, cancer will be a fact of life. ""Survival rates from the illness are increasing, and even those with incurable cancer often live for many years. ""This report is about highlighting what life with cancer really looks like for a lot of people - looking after their children, seeing friends and even going to work. ""Most people say they want to keep life as normal as possible after treatment. That's why it's vital they get the support they need to deal with the emotional, practical and financial problems cancer can cause.""

"Merseyrail plans to introduce a new fleet of driver-only trains from 2020 Workers at three train companies have gone on strike, causing travel disruption across England. Northern rail staff are on the last day of a three-day strike, while Merseyrail staff are on strike for the day and also plan action on 23 July. RMT union members at Southern have walked out on a one-day strike. The union is in dispute with the companies over driver-only-operated trains, which it says would be unsafe and lead to widespread job losses. ""The threat to abolish guards and introduce driver-only-operated trains is only part of the wider attack on rail services,"" said the RMT. The union said the dispute is not about pay or conditions but strike action is over ""concern about passenger safety"". In April RMT members demonstrated against the proposals and to mark the one-year anniversary of its dispute with Southern rail. Rail workers from across the country attended the protest outside Parliament Northern,externalstrike timetable Merseyrail,externalstrike timetable Southern,externalstrike timetable Northern said it expected to run more than 40% of its timetable and it would have additional rail replacement buses.
