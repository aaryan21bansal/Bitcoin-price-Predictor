"This video can not be played Mark Drakeford warns Wales could go into a post-Christmas lockdown if cases do not fall A post-Christmas lockdown will come into force if Covid cases do not begin to fall, the first minister has warned. Restrictions will be relaxed for the festive period but there is pressure for tougher rules from 28 December with more than 1,900 in hospital. Mark Drakeford said that while stricter rules were not a ""foregone conclusion"" the NHS will ""not be able to cope"" if admissions continue to rise. Outdoor attractions in Wales have been told they must close from Monday. The Welsh Government said the measure includes funfairs, and venues such as trampoline parks. It means attractions such as Swansea's Museum Park Christmas event, with a big wheel, rides and games stalls, will be shutting from Saturday, say its organisers. But other events, such as Christmas shopping markets across Wales will remain open - though carousel and fun rides in these locations will also have to shut. It follows a decision toclose secondary schoolsand FE colleges from Friday;ban alcohol sales from pubs and restaurantsand close hospitality venues at 18:00. Welsh Conservatives said responsibility for the current situation rests on ""the shoulders of the Welsh Labour-led Government"". Did Wales' firebreak lockdown work? Covid patients in hospitals at highest levels yet At limit for 'telling people what to do' on Covid Next week the Welsh Government will publish a ""Covid control plan"" laying out four alert levels of restrictions that could be imposed. At the highest level - level four - restrictions would be imposed that are equivalent to a lockdown. Mr Drakeford told a press conference it would be ""inevitable"" Wales would move to level four after Christmas if the measures taken recently and ""the efforts of each and every one of us do not succeed in turning the tide of the virus"". Previous lockdowns have seen travel restrictions imposed Under the four alert levels Level One would be the closest to normality Wales is likely to have before the summer and the widespread take-up of vaccinations Level Two has ""additional, targeted controls"" possibly complemented by local restrictions to manage specific incidents Level Three would see the ""strictest package of restrictions, short of a firebreak or lockdown"" implemented Level Four would have restrictions equivalent to lockdown The first minister suggested that level four restrictions would be Wales-wide but, in future, different areas of Wales could move to different levels. He warned that any new lockdown would not be for a fixed period of time, as weth the firebreak in October and November, but would be reviewed ""on a regular cycle"" and would be extended if needed. The first minister suggested the level four restrictions, if implemented, would be Wales-wide to begin with Mr Drakeford said Wales was currently at level three. The plan, to be put to the Senedd on Tuesday for debate, would set out how it would be possible to have more than one alert level in Wales if ""some parts of Wales established themselves in a reliable... and sustainable way as having a different level of the virus"". But he said Wales was not in that position now with the situation being ""very serious"" across the whole of the country. ""In some parts of Wales, such as Neath Port Talbot, Blaenau Gwent and Rhondda Cynon Taf, the rates are now incredibly high,"" he added. Mr Drakeford also warned there could be as many as 2,500 people with coronavirus in hospitals by Christmas Day, if the increases in admissions continue. ""Our NHS will not be able to cope if we continue to see this level of coronavirus-related admissions in the coming weeks, on top of the normal winter pressures,"" he said. Under level four, Wales would see restrictions similar to the spring lockdown, with people told to stay at home but with schools and colleges and places of worship remaining open. There would be no extended household bubbles, except for single adults who could form a support bubble with one other household. No-one would be allowed to meet people outside their household or travel without a reasonable excuse. Non-essential retail would be shut, but with click and collect allowed. Public parks would be open and wedding ceremonies could take place, but receptions and wakes would not be allowed. Car dealer Nathan Griffiths says a post-Christmas lockdown would be difficult for his business In Bridgend, car dealer Nathan Griffiths wants to put 2020 behind him, and look forward to 2021. But the potential for a new lockdown after the Christmas break could dampen those hopes. ""As an employer, January is normally a really busy time for us,"" he said. ""We're even looking, if this announcement goes through, that we actually just furlough everybody and close for January."" It would hit the 100 staff they have across three sites. They had been hoping to expand the business in 2020 to a fourth site. Instead, it could now mean reducing the sites to two. ""I think the uncertainty is the hardest thing,"" he added. Andrew RT Davies, Welsh Conservative health spokesman, said: ""The First Minister's announcement today set out the bleak landscape before the people of Wales in relation to Covid infection rates and the huge pressure our NHS is under. ""Much of the responsibility for the current situation sits on the shoulders of the Welsh Labour-led Government for the poor decisions they have taken up until today. ""As Welsh Conservatives, we stand ready to work with the government here to bear down on the virus and regain control of the situation"". Plaid Cymru health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said: ""You've only got to look at the trajectory that we are on, certainly for Wales as a whole, to see that if things don't improve it's very, very likely we will need tighter restrictions."" He agreed with the idea of acting in a ""regionally sensitive way"" and said his own Ynys Mon constituency currently had low case numbers, but had seen larger outbreaks earlier in the year. ""The problem with a fully national system is you are perhaps trying to balance what's effective in areas of high prevalence with what's acceptable in areas where it's very low,"" he said.

"Self-isolation for contacts of people with confirmed coronavirus will be shortened from 14 to 10 days across the UK from Monday. The change will also apply to people instructed to quarantine after returning from high-risk countries. And it means anyone who has been self-isolating for 10 days or more will be able to end their quarantine on Monday. The announcement comes as data shows Covid cases falling in most of England and Northern Ireland. But theOffice for National Statistics (ONS) figures showthat in the week to 5 December, there were increases in coronavirus case numbers in London and the east of England. Meanwhile, new data shows the virus's reproduction or R number is back at levels seen two weeks ago (0.9 - 1) meaning the epidemic is not growing, but it's not really shrinking either. According tothe latest government data,external, there have been a further 424 deaths within 28 days of a positive test in the UK and another 21,672 coronavirus cases. On Thursday,Health Secretary Matt Hancock announcedmass testing would be rolled out for secondary school children, their families and teachers in the worst-affected areas of London, Kent and Essex where cases are rising. The change in self-isolation rules was announced in a  statement from the four UK chief medical officers (CMOs) said: ""After reviewing the evidence, we are now confident that we can reduce the number of days that contacts self-isolate from 14 days to 10. ""People who return from countries which are not on the travel corridor list should also self-isolate for 10 days instead of 14 days."" Each of the four nations has its own lists of ""travel corridor"" countries which are exempt from the quarantine rules. While in the main, they include the same countries, they can differ slightly. The change to self-isolation ruleshas already been announced in Wales, but this new announcement will apply to all four nations. Those with symptoms or a positive test are already expected to isolate for 10 days. Covid: What is self-isolation and who has to do it? NHS Covid-19 app adds self-isolation payments Wales' Covid self-isolation period cut to 10 days Where can you get winter sun without quarantining? The CMOs added that self-isolation was ""essential to reducing the spread of Covid as it breaks the chains of transmission"". The NHS app in England will not update its 14-day counter until next Thursday. Because there will be a time-lag before it updates, anyone who has been advised to isolate by the app can leave isolation if their countdown timer hits three days between Monday and Thursday. People are most infectious around the time they first develop symptoms and, 10 days into an infection, only about 2% will still be capable of passing on the virus to others. The change in the rules reflects this low risk, which was judged not to justify asking people to self-isolate for longer periods. This video can not be played Covid symptoms: What are they and how long should I self-isolate for? Deputy Chief Medical Officer for England Dr Jenny Harries said the science was based on ""a continuous accumulation of evidence through the pandemic"". She said the ""tail end"" of an infection was the period someone was least likely to transmit infection. The latest estimate of the R number for the UK is 0.9 and 1 - up very slightly on the previous week. This means that the epidemic is still shrinking after lockdown but very slowly. This is borne out by the latest Office for National Statistics infection survey. It indicates that cases continued to fall in most of England and Northern Ireland last week. But the view of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) is that the situation is fragile. Cases are increasing in London and the East of England - especially among secondary school age children - and previous experience indicates that a surge among older age groups will inevitably follow. The government's scientific advisers believe that it will be important to keep infection levels as low as possible in the run up to the holidays. That's because the relaxation of restrictions that permit families to meet over Christmas will accelerate any increase in cases - and lead to another spike in infections early in the New Year. One study suggested that less than 20% of people fully complied with self-isolation - although it's been pointed out this doesn't distinguish between people breaking the rules slightly by going for a walk on their own, and those who ignore it entirely. Economic hardship has been identified a key factor in people not being able to isolate. But it is understood the main aim of the change was not to encourage more people to comply. Instead, the chief medical officers, say it reflects the highest-risk period, when people are most likely to be infectious. A pilot in Liverpool is looking at testing the contacts of an infected person every day for a period after exposure, and not asking them to isolate unless they test positive. This will be seen as the most attractive option as, if it doesn't increase infections, it will prevent significant numbers of people including school children from having to stay at home. But it's not thought this will be able to be rolled out until early next year, provided the results of the pilot are positive.

"Frank Atherton: ""The reality is we are in a difficult position in Wales"" Authorities have ""reached the limit... [of] telling people what to do"", Wales' top doctor has said, warning of a ""perilous"" rise in coronavirus cases. However, chief medical officer Frank Atherton said ministers were considering whether more restrictions would be needed in the coming weeks. Asked if that could happen before Christmas, he said: ""That's something ministers are considering."" The first minister Mark Drakeford had appeared to rule that out on Tuesday. Facing the same question, in the Senedd, Mr Drakeford said: ""I don't think that means that we will be taking further measures this side of Christmas."" Covid patients in hospitals at highest levels yet Shops on a 'knife edge' under Covid-19 rules Record high Covid rates in Welsh council areas Speaking to Dot Davies on BBC Radio Wales on Thursday, Dr Atherton urged people to think about their behaviour to keep themselves safe. He has previously said he will not be visiting relatives in Northern Ireland and England over Christmas. There will be a time lag before officials know the effect of the current rules, including the ban on serving alcohol in hospitality venues. This video can not be played Wales faces ""difficult winter"" ,,says Dr Frank Atherton ""Ministers are considering what to do in the period immediately after Christmas to try to give us some headroom into January,"" Dr Atherton said. ""But the reality is we are in a difficult position in Wales. We are in a difficult position in the UK, but Wales has the highest rates at the moment of the four nations. ""And so it's down to all of us to think about what we can do to keep ourselves safe. ""I really believe that we have reached the limit of what we can do through legislation, through telling people what to do."" ""We have to say to the people of Wales, 'Look at the situation we are in'. ""It really is quite perilous."" Dr Atherton also warned parents should not be talking at school gates, because of the risk of Covid-transmission, and ""we need to have as little contact as possible"". ""Even that kind of level of human contact in the winter with the level of virus transmission that we have in Wales can pass [on] the virus"", he said.

"Britons holidaying on Spain's Canary Islands say their Christmas plans have been thrown into jeopardy after quarantine rules were imposed. Travellers returning to the UK will have to self-isolate from Saturday due to rising infection rates, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said. Travel giant Tui said 800 people were due to depart for the islands on Friday morning, with 5,000 there already. The quarantine periodwill be shortened from 14 to 10 days from Monday. A statement from the four UK chief medical officers said the change came after a review of evidence and that self-isolation for those with coronavirus symptoms remained important. Where can you get winter sun without quarantining? Will I get my money back if I can't go on holiday? Meanwhile, the Foreign Office has yet to change its travel advice for the Canary Islands, meaning many holidaymakers may be unable to seek refunds or claim on their travel insurance policies. The new quarantine restrictions will be in place from 04:00 GMT on 12 December. Travellers to mainland Spain already have to isolate, but an exemption for the islands in October encouraged many to book a break in almost-guaranteed winter sun, travel expert Simon Calder told BBC Breakfast. The Department for Transport (DfT) said there had been a ""sharp increase"" in the number of positive coronavirus tests on the islands. It comes as an upcoming ""test-to-release"" policy will allow travellers to leave quarantine after five days - if they pay for a private coronavirus test and receive a negative result. Even a reduced 10-day quarantine period would mean some of those due to return later next week would still need to isolate over Christmas. Steve Hay, from Bournemouth, arrived in Lanzarote on Thursday evening for a seven-day break with his family. They now face cutting it short to avoid a quarantine period that could potentially run until 27 December - effectively cancelling their Christmas plans in the UK. ""How will we do our Christmas shopping?"" Mr Hay said. ""I think it's shocking and doesn't appear much thought has gone into it. ""Why is it being implemented so quick, this only gives us tomorrow to get back. ""I think it's crazy and the Canaries cannot be looked at as a whole, each island should be rated."" Ivor Langford says he faces Christmas alone without his wife after she returned home sooner than planned Ivor Langford from Worcestershire, who is currently at his holiday home in Lanzarote, told the BBC the rule change meant he now faced spending Christmas Day alone in the UK. His wife recently returned to the UK after her father caught Covid-19 in hospital, he said. ""I have been given less than a day to fly home before Saturday 04:00,"" he said. ""I'm due to fly back on 16 December but now will have to have Christmas without my wife."" HOLIDAYS:Where can I go away in the UK? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? SOCIAL LIFE:The rules when I go to the pub? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries More than 800 people are waiting to find out whether their Tui holidays to Tenerife departing on Saturday morning will be cancelled, because the Foreign Office has not yet decided whether to also advise against travel to the islands. If the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office advises against travel to the Canary Islands, Tui will cancel all holidays immediately as this change invalidates travel insurance. It also expects to cancel its entire Christmas holiday schedule, a further blow to the operator which recorded losses of  â¬3bn (Â£2.74bn) on Thursday. Tui said it would allow those booked between Friday and 17 December ""the opportunity to amend free of charge to another date or destination"". Airline Easyjet said customers wishing to transfer their flights without a fee must do so within a week. The new test-to-release programme begins on 15 December, allowing travellers arriving in England to reduce their quarantine by more than half if they pay for a Covid test after five days. They will have to opt in to the scheme on a passenger locator form,according to the government website,external. The DfT said families could decide which members opted in to suit their circumstances but that only those who took a test after five days and received a negative result could be released early. The tests, from private firms, will cost between Â£65 and Â£120. A list of approved providers has yet to be published. England has also introduced a quarantine exemption for certain categories of travellers, including people making high-value business trips, sports stars and performing arts professionals.

"This video can not be played Covid: Watch how case rates have changed in Wales It has been a little over a month since Wales came out of its 17-day firebreak lockdown. Pubs were closed, as were non-essential retailers, and people were told to stay home - much like the first lockdown in the spring. Wales went into lockdown earlier than the rest of the UK with the restrictions coming in on 23 October. Ten days earlier, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer called for a short lockdownin England, where a four-week lockdown  did not begin until 5 November. After an initial drop in cases following Wales' lockdown, they have risen again, with First Minister Mark Drakeford saying the situation had ""deteriorated"" and was ""very serious indeed"". He alsowarned there could be a new lockdown at the end of December. So, how has Wales ended up in this position? Q&A: Can I meet friends under new Covid rules? NHS staff sickness having 'huge impact' on care Wales' firebreak ended on Monday, 9 November, with new nationwide restrictions coming into force. During the week between 2 November and 8 November, the final week of the tighter restrictions, the case rate in the country was 206.2 per 100,000 people. In the weeks after, this number fell to 170.6, before climbing to 192.3, then to 231.6 by the end of November. The figure now stands at a record 403.8. The week before the firebreak lockdown it was 234.5. InFriday's Public Health Wales figures, 10 of Wales' 22 counties, mostly in the south, recorded record high case rates since the start of the pandemic. When broken down locally, the heads of the south Wales valleys have shown up most of the hotspots for cases in the last few weeks. In recent days, Neath Port Talbot has provided five of the 20 worst-hit neighbourhoods and local health officials have warned about community transmission. Villages around Maesteg in Bridgend are also showing up - with Caerau having the highest local case rate - with more than 2,000 cases per 100,000 in the last week - 142 actual positive tests. Meanwhile, the 'R' number in Wales has risen to between 0.8 and 1.1, after a fall following the firebreak. The latest infection survey from the Office for National Statistics on Friday also suggested infections were rising, with 25,600 people in Wales estimated to have had Covid-19 in the week to 4 December, 7,500 more than the week before. This is one in 120 people. The first minister said on Wednesday the situation in Wales was ""very difficult"",but not out of control, amid accusations from opposition parties that he was losing his grip on the virus. He has has claimed that the recent rise in cases was partly due to people not being willing to follow the rules. Dr Richard Stanton, a reader in virology at Cardiff University, said there was ""no mystery"" as to why cases have increased, but the firebreak was successful in reducing the level of the virus in the community - albeit temporarily. He said: ""We know what causes rates to go up and that's people being in close contact with one another. ""The minute you leave a lockdown rates start to go up, because people come into contact with each other again in supermarkets, shops, etc. ""All of these environments lead to an increase in the amount of time people come into contact and the amount of virus in circulation. ""The rate of increase before the lockdown was quite similar to the rate of increase we're having now. The lockdown was projected to reset the level by about a month and it did that. But obviously if you change your measures at that point, the rate is going to go up."" Dr Stanton added that Wales is seeing more of an increase relative to England and other parts of the UK because restrictions have been eased for longer. Wales' lockdown ended on 9 November, only a few days after England's four-week circuit breaker began. ""I think effectively, the situation in England and Wales is exactly the same but we're offset by about two weeks,"" he said. ""If England doesn't do anything now, that's where England will be in two to three weeks' time."" Dr Simon Williams, a senior lecturer in people and organisation at Swansea University, said it was ""surprising"" at how quickly the rates in Wales had rebounded. He said: ""It was suggested prior to the firebreak that a short, sharp shock was necessary to bring the virus under control, and it isn't, particularly in south Wales."" Dr Williams said there was ""no strong evidence"" that people were not adhering to the rules and the ""vast majority"" say they are sticking to them. However, he added people were becoming ""fatigued"" due to regular changes in restrictions, which could lead to people breaking certain rules without realising. ""I think if we haven't got evidence that people are breaking rules to any great extent and we can see that the cases are as they are, then you feel like we can only conclude that they were lifted too soon,"" he said. He added a longer lockdown, with a more gradual easing of restrictions, would have helped to delay the rise, but that it was ""inevitable"" that more relaxed restrictions would lead to a rise in cases. The firebreak ended and a new set of national rules came into force, which allowed shops, pubs and restaurants to reopen, two households to form a bubble and schools to remain open, although travel to and from the other parts of the UK was banned during England's lockdown. But in the weeks since, the rules have been altered. Rules about travelling into England were relaxed, with travel to and from England's tier one and two areas allowed, but pubs and restaurants must now shut by 18:00 and they are not allowed to sell alcohol. Meanwhile, ithas been announced secondary schools and many primaries will move to online learning from next week. The Welsh Conservatives and Plaid Cymru have both argued against the alcohol ban. On Friday, Mr Drakeford announceda new four-tier system for Wales, which would decide the level of restrictions in place. He said Wales was currently in tier three, the strictest package of restrictions short of a firebreak or a lockdown. The number of people in hospital with coronavirus has also hit record levels since the end of the firebreak, with 1,966 patients in hospital beds as of Thursday. This included a record number of patients - 628 - recovering from the virus. The figures also showed 83 people were in critical care. Around a quarter of all hospital beds have Covid patients in them and this proportion has been slowly rising. But NHS Wales, unlike during the first wave, has not been cancelling routine surgery yet. At the moment, about 78 Covid patients per day are being admitted to hospital with the virus on average - with numbers steady and even down slightly on the start of the month. However, as the winter continues and if Covid patients in beds continue at high levels, pressures will continue. This video can not be played The different measures for looking at deaths involving Covid-19 in Wales Hospital admissions have risen in each of Wales' health board areas, except Betsi Cadwaladr, which covers north Wales. In fact, counties in the north, particularly the north-west, have relatively low Covid levels. Anglesey (37.1) and Gwynedd (46.6) both have case rates below 50 cases per 100,000 people, far below the Welsh average. However, nine our of Wales' 22 counties have case rates over 500 per 100,000 people, which equates to one in every 200 people testing positive in the past week. The worst-hit counties are Merthyr Tydfil (764.2), Neath Port Talbot (718), Newport (634.9), Caerphilly (602), Blaenau Gwent (601.2), Bridgend (586.9), Swansea (580.6), Rhondda Cynon Taf (564.9) and Torfaen (503.4). All of these counties are in the south and south-east of Wales. Delayed reporting of 11,000 positive Covid tests Q&A: Can I meet friends under new Covid rules?

The Sunday deadline was set by the two leaders after months of talks failed to achieve an agreement. If a trade deal is not reached and ratified by both sides by 31 December, the UK and EU could impose taxes - tariffs - on each other's goods. This could lead to higher prices, among other changes. What happens if there's no trade deal? Ex-Australia PM warns over 'Australia-style' trade What is an 'Australia-style deal'? What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? Mr Johnson chaired a meeting in Downing Street with Cabinet Officer minister Michael Gove and senior officials on Friday to carry out a ""stock-take"" of plans for a no-deal scenario, a No 10 official said. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said there was ""no sign of much genuine movement to avert no deal"". With talks continuing, the EU is determined to prevent the UK from gaining what it sees as an unfair advantage of having tariff-free access to its markets, while setting its own standards on products, employment rights and business subsidies. It is also warning that, without access to UK waters for EU fleets, UK fishermen will no longer get special access to EU markets to sell their goods. But the UK argues that what goes on in its own waters, and its wider business rules, should be under its control as a sovereign country. The two sides also disagree on whether the European Court of Justice should settle future UK-EU trade disputes. Europe's leaders are keen to clarify they won't personally intervene in the current impasse in trade talks. There'll be no last-minute handshake or ""a-ha"" moment in Paris, Warsaw or Berlin. Behind the scenes, leaders are involved in discussions with their negotiators, but they don't want to be face-to-face, or ear-to-ear, with Boris Johnson in public. EU countries are joined together in their single market. So no individual EU leader - not even the most powerful ones, in France and Germany - can be perceived to be making the political compromises that could clinch the UK deal. Concessions will have an impact on the whole single market - and therefore all member states, as a collective. Read Katya's blog in full The EU has rejected Mr Johnson's request to bypass the European Commission and speak directly to French President Emmanuel Macron and Germany's Angela Merkel about the unresolved issues. According to EU officials, he was told discussions could only take place through the bloc's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier. Speaking on a visit to a vehicle battery factory in Blyth, Northumberland, Mr Johnson said: ""We're always hopeful and... our team is still out there in Brussels. ""If there's a big offer, a big change in what they're saying, then I must say that I'm yet to see it."" If there was no deal, the situation would still be ""wonderful for the UK"", as the country could ""do exactly what we want from 1 January"", he added, even if this was ""different from what we set out to achieve"". Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are happening:The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. What happens next with Brexit? Mrs von der Leyen, who met the prime minister in Brussels on Wednesday for three hours of talks, reportedly struck a downbeat tone when she told European national leaders the ""main obstacles"" to a deal remained. She later told reporters that the two sides were still ""apart on fundamental issues"". This video can not be played EC President Ursula von der Leyen says Brexit will be ""new beginnings for old friends"" But German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas struck a more upbeat tone, saying: ""We believe finding a solution in the talks is difficult but possible."" And Ireland's Taoiseach Micheal Martin said there was room for the two sides to ""come closer"" on the major sticking points if there was the ""political will"" to do so. Earlier on Friday, UK Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden suggested UK farmers and car manufacturers would get extra financial help if the EU targeted their products with tariffs. And the EU hasset out contingency measuresit would take in the event of no trade agreement being reached with the UK. It says these would ensure UK and EU air and road connections still run after the post-Brexit transition period - under which the UK has continued to follow most of Brussels' rules - ends on 31 December. They also allow the possibility of fishing access to each other's waters for up to a year, or until an agreement is reached. SIMPLE GUIDE: What happens next with Brexit?

"CCTV footage of Sinaga near his flat was used as evidence at his trials Serial rapist Reynhard Sinaga is believed to have targeted more than 200 victims, 60 of whom remain unidentified, police have said. Sinaga, described as Britain's most prolific rapist,was found guiltyin January of luring 48 men to his Manchester flat and filming himself sexually assaulting and raping them. Hisminimum jail term has been extended from 30 to 40 yearsat the High Court. Police now believe Sinaga committed sexual offences against 206 men. Sinaga, who was a postgraduate student , would wait for men leaving nightclubs and bars before leading them to his Princess Street flat on the edge of the city centre. This video can not be played Who is Reynhard Sinaga? The BBC's Judith Moritz reports on the case He drugged his victims before assaulting them while they were unconscious, often filming his rapes and collecting so-called trophies from them, such as mobile phones. When the victims woke up many had no memory of what had happened. He was caught after one victim awoke as he was being abused and defended himself, before reporting the incident. Serial rapists receive longer minimum jail terms The sexual predator who waited outside nightclubs File on 4: Britain's most prolific rapist When officers seized Sinaga's phone, they found hundreds of hours of footage of the attacks, a discovery which led to the launch of the largest rape inquiry in British history. Police say Sinaga assaulted 206 men, but many have not been identified Sinaga, originally from Indonesia, lived in a rented flat just a few moments' walk from the Factory 251 nightclub. His trial was told he typically approached his victims, mostly men in their late teens or early 20s who had been out drinking, in the street and brought them back to his apartment. Many could not remember what happened, but some recalled being given a drink and then blacking out. Most were unaware they had been raped until they were contacted by police. Sinaga claimed all the sexual activity was consensual and that each man had agreed to being filmed while pretending to be asleep. In victim impact statements read out at the trial, one man said Sinaga had ""destroyed a part of my life"", while another said he had ""periods where I can't get up and face the day"". Evidence given in the trial suggested Sinaga drugged the men by giving them spiked drinks Assistant Chief Constable Mabs Hussain said as a result of further evidence ""coming to light"" since the trial, investigators had identified a further 23 victims and ""now believe that Sinaga committed sexual offences against 206 men"". ""We are yet to identify around 60 of these men and would urge anyone who thinks they may have been a victim to please get in touch with us,"" he added. After his trial concluded, Sinaga's case was referred to the Court of Appeal by the Attorney General under the unduly lenient sentence scheme. Judges rejected calls for a whole-life jail term but increased the minimum time he must spend in prison. They noted he had not shown any remorse.

"The Gender Identity Service is based at the Tavistock and Portman NHS Trust All but one child treated for gender dysphoria with puberty-blocking drugs at a leading NHS clinic also received cross-sex hormones, a study has shown. The Tavistock and Portman Trust has argued the treatments are not linked. The High Court ruled last weekthat under-16s are unlikely to be able to give informed consent to be treated with puberty-blocking drugs. The trust said the study's findings were not accepted by a peer-reviewed journal until the day of the judgement. What are puberty blockers? Puberty blockers: Under-16s 'unlikely to be able to give informed consent' Questions remain over puberty-blockers, as review clears study These findings,externalare from a study run by the Tavistock's Gender Identity Development Service (GIDS) - England's only NHS specialist gender clinic for children - and research partners at University College London Hospitals. The study began in 2011 and enrolled 44 children aged between 12 and 15 over the following three years. At the time, only those aged 16 and over were eligible for puberty blockers in the UK. When BBC Newsnightcovered the study and its preliminary findings last yearit highlighted howprevious research,externalsuggested all young people who took blockers went on to take cross-sex hormones - the next stage towards transitioning to the opposite gender. The Tavistock's newly published findings appear to confirm this, with 43 out of 44 participants - or 98% - choosing to start treatment with cross-sex hormones. Earlier this month, theHigh Court ruled,externalthat children under-16 were unlikely to be able togive informed consent to treatment with puberty blockers. The relationship between blockers and subsequent treatment with cross-sex hormones was a core feature of the case. Lawyers representing the claimants said there was ""a very high likelihood"" children who start taking hormone blockers will later begin taking cross-sex hormones, leading potentially to infertility and impaired sexual function. The Tavistock argued puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones were entirely separate stages of treatment and one does not automatically lead to the other. The judges rejected that argument, saying ""in our view this does not reflect the reality"". ""The evidence shows that the vast majority of children who take [puberty blockers] move on to take cross-sex hormones,"" and that these are part of ""one clinical pathway"". This video can not be played Gender reassignment: Puberty blocker ruling 'protects vulnerable teens' The study findings potentially lend further support to that assertion. The Tavistock disputes this, saying that as those in this study had persistent and consistent gender dysphoria throughout their childhood, it is not surprising they would seek to continue treatment after 16. It argues that the fact not all chose to do so shows this course of treatment is not an inevitability. Furthermore, the data was requested by the High Court during the hearing, but the Tavistock did not provide it. The data, the trust argued, would be published in a peer-reviewed journal, but comments were being reviewed by the study's principal investigator, Prof Russell Viner - the president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. However, the Tavistock published the data the day after the High Court handed down its judgement, and not in a peer-reviewed journal. The Tavistock told the BBC that the paper was not accepted for publication until the day of the judgement and it was put into preprint that day. The published study showed that treatment with the blocker brought about no change in psychological function. This differs from Dutch findings ""which reported improved psychological function,"" upon which many gender clinics have based their treatment. Preliminary findings,externalwhich showed that after a year on blockers, there was a significant increase in those answering the statement: ""I deliberately try to hurt or kill myself"", were not replicated across the duration of the study. The study had no control group - with children who did not take puberty blockers - to enable the researchers to compare results with. So, it is hard to infer cause and effect or draw conclusions as to the potential harms or benefits of this treatment. The Gender Identity Service is based at the Tavistock and Portman NHS Trust The study also measured the impact of puberty blocking drugs on children's height and bone density. The researchers found that suppressing puberty ""reduced growth that was dependent on puberty hormones"". Height growth continued, ""but more slowly than for their peers"". The Tavistock Trust said ""the paper has now been accepted by a peer-reviewed journal and will be published soon"". All new referrals for puberty blockers are currently paused because of the High Court's ruling, and anNHS review,externalinto gender identity services for children and young people is currently under way.

"After her diagnosis with Alzheimer's six years ago, actress Dame Barbara Windsor became a campaigner for those living with dementia. Following the star's death at the age of 83, charities have praised her for helping bring the disease out into the open. So, how did she help others in the UK? Helen Marshall, from Halifax, says Dame Barbara's campaigning made it easier to speak to her mum, Audrey, about her dementia, after she was diagnosed in 2015. Helen, 50, says she ""vividly"" remembers how they watched Dame Barbara visiting the prime minister at No 10, where she delivered a letter signed by 100,000 people pleading for better care for people with dementia. ""She was such an icon, in their generation as well as ours. For somebody so famous to come out and talk about it - it was a shift for my mum,"" she says, explaining that until that point Audrey, 88, never discussed her diagnosis. Actress Dame Barbara Windsor dies aged 83 Mitchell brothers actors pay tribute to Windsor In pictures: Dame Barbara Windsor ""I don't know if she forgot or was in denial, with dementia you don't know."" But after seeing the footage, Audrey acknowledged her condition. ""It was quite visible, the effect [Alzheimer's] had had on [Dame Barbara]. I think that was what resonated with mum."" Helen Marshall with her mum Audrey Clayton Helen also believes attitudes towards those with dementia have changed since Dame Barbara shared ""candid"" details of the effects of dementia on ""every aspect of life"". ""I've noticed mum's peers are more able to talk about it,"" she says. ""There's still a lot more to do though. ""It can be a long time before people are diagnosed so the more awareness people have and the less stigma there is, it might mean diagnoses come quicker."" Katie Thomas, 48, from Goddington, Oxfordshire, says campaigning by Dame Barbara and her husband Scott Mitchell, was ""so important"" in the effort to raise awareness and encourage funding to find a cure for dementia. ""They were instrumental in trying to get awareness and out, and in their openness about the disease,"" she says. Katie Thomas, with her dad Prof Ceri Peach, who received a Doctor of Letters degree from Oxford University a year after he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's Katie ran two marathons this year, including the virtual London Marathon, in memory of her father, Ceri Peach - an Oxford University professor who was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in 2015 and died aged 78 in October 2018. She raised Â£10,000 for dementia research through the two events - the first completed in her village during the spring lockdown, and the second in Oxford, where her dad lectured in geography at St Catherine's College, this autumn. Katie says she was inspired to take on the fundraising challenges after cheering on runners taking part in the 2019 London Marathon - in a team called Barbara's Revolutionaries. ""I joined their Facebook page, which [Dame Barbara's husband] Scott was a massive part of, and got to know a lot of people, and started running."" Katie with husband Howard, and her two boys, Will and Charlie, her ""greatest cheerleaders"" Crossing the finish line in the University Parks in Oxford on 4 October for the virtual London Marathon The training has since helped with her grief. ""Just getting out. Especially when the lockdown happened, it's just being able to get out in the fresh air and run,"" she says. ""It's my own time, and time to think things through and think about dad. It's really helped in that way. ""I feel very close to him when I run."" Dame Barbara Windsor and her husband, Scott, went public with her condition in 2018, four years after her diagnosis. The same year, she appeared on a video in aid of a campaign to raise funds and change attitudes towards the condition. ""I'm asking you to make a stand against dementia,"" she said. Her husband and former EastEnders co-stars raised more than Â£150,000 by running the London Marathon in aid of a dementia campaign. Dame Barbara was credited by her friend and former Albert Square co-star Ross Kemp, who made an ITV documentary on dementia, for helping to change the way people thought about the condition. Robert Beattie was diagnosed with Alzheimer's three years ago, and says he takes living with the disease ""day by day"". He will often forget what room he is in, won't know where the bedroom or bathroom is, and his wife Karen will have to guide him through the process of getting changed. Karen says Dame Barbara going public about her diagnosis has been important ""to get the government talking about it and hopefully do something about it"". ""Hopefully the momentum won't stop,"" she adds. ""And we'll get more people like Rob and me that will go out and talk. ""People inside the houses that have shame, we need you to do the same thing and get this on the platform so that we can get the help that we need."" Downing Street says the government has committed to ""significantly increasing research funding, over a number of years to help improve detection and care for people living with dementia"".

A top three hit on both sides of the Atlantic, it quickly became a standard, with the New Yorker calling it ""one of the few worthy modern additions to the holiday canon"". Carey started writing the song while living in upstate New York in the summer of 1994, while playing the movie It's A Wonderful Life for inspiration. She quickly stumbled on a chord progression and melody, which she captured on a mini tape recorder and brought to her longtime collaborator Walter Afanasieff. He originally worried it was too basic. But that's exactly the quality that has made it such an enduring hit. ""The oversimplified melody made it easily palatable for the whole world to go, 'Oh, I can't get that out of my head!"" he said in an interview with ASCAP. This video can not be played All I Want For Christmas Is You: Meet the man behind Mariah Carey's festive classic In her recent memoir, Carey said the song's opening chimes are meant to evoke the ""little wooden toy pianos, like the one Schroeder had on Peanuts"". ""I actually did bang out most of the song on a cheap little Casio keyboard,"" she added. ""But it's the feeling I wanted to capture. There's a sweetness, a clarity and a purity to it."" Although she was unhappy at the time, dealing with the pressures of fame and a tempestuous relationship with her future husband Tommy Mottola, she wanted to ""write a song that would me me happy and make me feel like a loved, carefree young girl at Christmas"". ""I wanted to sing it in a way that would capture joy for everyone and crystallise it forever,"" she added. ""Yes, I was going for vintage Christmas happiness."" 'Finally able to enjoy it' The song has since earned her more than $60m (Â£45m) in royalties; and has cumulatively spent 70 weeks in the UK's top 100. Last year, it topped the charts in America for the first time, making Carey the first artist to score a number one single in four different decades. Speaking to the New York Times, however, the singer said she wasn't competitive about such matters. ""I don't need something else to validate the existence of this song,""she said,external. ""I used to pick it apart whenever I listened to it, but at this point, I feel like I'm finally able to enjoy it."" Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

"The coronavirus which causes Covid-19 makes some people seriously ill while others have no symptoms at all Why some people with coronavirus have no symptoms and others get extremely ill is one of the pandemic's biggest puzzles. A study in Nature,externalof more than 2,200 intensive care patients has identified specific genes that may hold the answer. They make some people more susceptible to severe Covid-19 symptoms. The findings shed light on where the immune system goes wrong, which could help identify new treatments. These will continue to be needed even though vaccines are being developed, says Dr Kenneth Baillie, a consultant in medicine at the Royal Infirmary in Edinburgh, who led theGenomicc project,external. ""Vaccines should drastically decrease the numbers of covid cases, but it's likely doctors will still be treating the disease in intensive care for a number of years around the world, so there is an urgent need to find new treatments."" Scientists looked at the DNA of patients in more than 200 intensive care units in UK hospitals. They scanned each personâs genes, which contain the instructions for every biological process - including how to fight a virus. Their genomes were then compared with the DNA of healthy people to pinpoint any genetic differences, and a number were found - the first in a gene called TYK2. âIt is part of the system that makes your immune cells more angry, and more inflammatory,â explained Dr Baillie. But if the gene is faulty, this immune response can go into overdrive, putting patients at risk of damaging lung inflammation. A class of anti-inflammatory drugs already used for conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis targets this biological mechanism, including a drug called Baricitinib. âIt makes it a very plausible candidate for a new treatment,â Dr Baillie said. âBut of course, we need to do large-scale clinical trials in order to find out if that's true or not.â Genetic differences were also found in a gene called DPP9, which plays a role in inflammation, and in a gene called OAS, which helps to stop the virus from making copies of itself. Variations in a gene called IFNAR2 were also identified in the intensive care patients. IFNAR2 is linked to a potent anti-viral molecule called interferon, which helps to kick-start the immune system as soon as an infection is detected. Itâs thought that producing too little interferon can give the virus an early advantage, allowing it to quickly replicate, leading to more severe disease. Two other recent studies published in the journal Science have also implicated interferon in Covid cases, through bothgenetic mutations,externalandan autoimmune disorder,externalthat affects its production. Prof Jean-Laurent Casanova, who carried out the research, from The Rockefeller University in New York, said: â[Interferon] accounted for nearly 15% of the critical Covid-19 cases internationally enrolled in our cohort."" Interferon can be given as a treatment, but a World Health Organization clinical trial concluded that it did not help very sick patients. However, Prof Casanova said the timing was important. He explained: âI hope that if given in the first two, three, four days of infection, the interferon would work, because it essentially would provide the molecule that the [patient] does not produce by himself or by herself.â Dr Vanessa Sancho-Shimizu, a geneticist from Imperial College London, said that the genetic discoveries were providing an unprecedented insight into the biology of the disease. âIt really is an example of precision medicine, where we can actually identify the moment at which things have gone awry in that individual,â she told BBC News. âThe findings from these genetic studies will help us identify particular molecular pathways that could be targets for therapeutic intervention,"" she said. But the genome still holds some mysteries. The Genomicc study - and several others - has revealed a cluster of genes on chromosome 3 strongly linked to severe symptoms. However, the biology underpinning this is not yet understood. More patients will now be asked to take part in this research. Dr Baillie said: âWe need everyone, but we're particularly keen to recruit people from minority ethnic groups who are over-represented in the critically ill population."" He added: âThere's still a very urgent need to find new treatments for this disease and we have to make the right choices about which treatments to try next, because we don't have time to make mistakes.""

"This video can not be played Kate Green: Honours system ""offensive and divisive"" Honours titles associated with the British Empire are ""offensive and divisive"" and should be rebranded, a senior Labour MP has told the BBC. Kate Green, who got an OBE in 2005, told thePolitical Thinking podcastit gave people ""huge pleasure"" to have their achievements recognised. But the shadow education secretary said honours were hierarchical and the link to Empire was ""hurtful to people"". ""You can't justify that branding,"" she told host Nick Robinson. But the Conservatives said ""abandoning"" the current honours system would amount to ""cultural and historic vandalism"". Guide to the Honours What's the difference between OBE, MBE and CBE? Teach British Empire injustice in schools - Labour Labour MP apology over calling Covid 'good crisis' Orders of the British Empire - the CBE, OBE and MBE - were first awarded during World War One to recognise the contribution of civilians to the war effort and the actions of service personnel in support positions. They are now awarded for outstanding achievements in different fields at either a national or local level. The British Empire Medal, awarded for significant community service, was revived in 2012, having been scrapped in 1993. Some Labour MPs have previous called for the word ""empire"" to be replaced by ""excellence"" in honours awarded by the Queen. Ms Green told the BBC's Nick Robinson she had thought hard before accepting an OBE for services to charity and welfare for her work in helping children as chief executive of the Child Poverty Action Group and before that as director of the National Council for One Parent Families. She said she decided to take the honour, which she received five years before she entered Parliament in 2010, because it ""thrilled"" her father. While honours were a valuable way of celebrating people's contributions to their community or country, she added, their association with the economic and racial injustices of the British Empire was not defensible. Ed Sheeran is among the famous people to have received an MBE ""It's really the wrong language. It's divisive, it's offensive and hurtful to people. ""One of the things I've been looking at a lot in recent weeks is the black curriculum campaign and decolonising our history and the whole curriculum. You can't excuse or justify that branding."" She said issues with the way in which honours were handed out ran ""deeper"" than just the titles and a ""lot more reform was needed"" of the secretive system. Members of the public can nominate people for honours, but critics say the committees that make the final decisions are not representative of society as a whole and awards for political service make a mockery of the system. Boris Johnson, Theresa May, David Cameron and Tony Blair have all been criticised for using the honours system to reward political allies and people who have give money to their parties. ""I know many efforts have been made to democratise and open up that honours system but it's still pretty hierarchical of who gets what,"" she said. Conservative Party co-chairwoman Amanda Milling said: ""The names given to our national honours reflect this country's history and traditions. ""We should not abandon them, just as we shouldn't rename the Victoria Line, the Royal Albert Hall or the Imperial War Museum, or tear down the countless public monuments, statues and landmarks that tell the story of our United Kingdom. ""To do so would be an act of cultural and historic vandalism."" At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"A lone Republican senator has blocked a congressional vote to create two new Smithsonian museums dedicated to American women and Latinos. Casting his dissenting vote, Senator Mike Lee said they would ""further divide an already divided nation"". The legislation received unanimous bipartisan support by the remainder of the 100-member Senate. Founded 170 years ago, the Washington-based Smithsonian features 19 museums. It boasts of being the ""world's largest museum, education and research complex,"" with the newest Smithsonian museum - the Museum of African American History and Culture - added in 2016. A museum for Latino history has been being considered for at least 20 years, after a government report found in the early 1990s that the Smithsonian ""displays a pattern of wilful neglect"" toward Latinos and ""almost entirely excludes and ignores Latinos in nearly every aspect of its operations"". Minority voters who changed their minds about Trump A measure to create a women history's museum was introduced in the early 2000s. In his speech on the Senate floor on Thursday night, Mr Lee - a Utah senator who leans libertarian - condemned politics based on identity - a topic that many conservative Americans have voiced objections to in recent years. ""My objection to the creation of a new Smithsonian museum or series of museums based on group identity, what Theodore Roosevelt called hyphenated Americanism, is not a matter of budgetary or legislative technicalities,"" he said. ""It is a matter of national unity and cultural inclusion."" Soldiers outside the African American museum during summer protests Because the authors of the two museum bills had sought a unanimous vote of all 100 senators, each measure was struck down in its entirety by Mr Lee's objection. Measures supporting the Latino museum and women's museum had already been passed earlier this year by the House of Representatives - the lower chamber of Congress. Mr Lee went on to say: ""The so-called critical theory undergirding this movement does not celebrate diversity; it weaponises diversity. ""I understand what my colleagues are trying to do and why. I respect what they're trying to do. I even share their interests in ensuring that these stories are told. But the last thing we need is to further divide an already divided nation with an array of segregated, separate-but-equal museums for hyphenated identity groups."" This video can not be played Why did so many Latinos back Trump? In a following debate, Mr Lee argued that Native Americans and black Americans had their histories ""virtually erased,"" which was why Smithsonian institutions exist for them. ""We have been systematically excluded,"" retorted New Jersey Democratic Senator Bob Menendez, the author of the Latino museum bill. ""Believe me, we have been,"" he added, accusing Mr Lee of standing ""in the way of the hopes and dreams and aspirations of seeing Americans of Latino descent having their dreams fulfilled and recognised"". Latina Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a liberal Democrat from New York, was among those criticising Mr Lee. She noted that the debate over these two bills came as coronavirus stimulus relief bills continued to stall in the Senate. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Maine Republican Senator Susan Collins, who sponsored the Smithsonian Women's History Museum Act, joined in the criticism of Mr Lee, calling it a ""sad moment"" and adding that ""it seems wrong"" for a single senator to block such popular measures. ""Surely in a year where we are celebrating the 100th anniversary of women's suffrage, this is the time, this is the moment to finally pass the legislation,"" she said, referring to the centennial of women's right to vote in the US. Museum advocates say Mr Lee's objection is just one of many roadblocks, and that other legislative avenues still exist to having the measures pass. Senators could still attempt to attach the museum measures to the year's highly important budget bill, or otherwise reintroduce the measures when the new Congress convenes in January. Even if the votes had passed, it would still be years before building would begin, as Congress would also need to vote again to allocate funds to the projects. This video can not be played Latino or Hispanic? What's the difference? Last week, Smithsonian Secretary Lonnie G Bunch III released a statement praising the two bills. ""Creating new museums is challenging, but, with appropriate funding, the Smithsonian has the skill and expertise to do it right,"" he said.

"The court ruled that the law was aimed at Muslim schoolgirls and was unconstitutional Austria's constitutional court has struck down a law prohibiting primary school children from wearing specific religious head coverings. It said the law was aimed at the Islamic headscarf and breached rights on religious freedom. The law was passed during the previous coalition government in which the conservative People's Party was allied with the far-right Freedom Party. The court said the law could lead to the marginalisation of Muslim girls. It also rejected the government's argument that the prohibition could protect girls from social pressures from classmates, saying it penalised the wrong people. It said, if necessary, the state needed to draw up legislation to better prevent bullying on the grounds of gender or religion. The legislation, which came into force last year, did not specify that headscarves were banned but instead proscribed the wearing of ""religious clothing that is associated with a covering of the head"" for children up to the age of 10. The government had itself said that head coverings worn by Sikh boys or the Jewish skullcap would not be affected. The court decided that the ban was in fact aimed at Muslim headscarves. ""The selective ban... applies exclusively to Muslim schoolgirls and thereby separates them in a discriminatory manner from other pupils,"" court President Christoph Grabenwarter said. Austria backs green agenda with new coalition deal Austria's new justice minister hit by hate speech Education Minister Heinz Fassman said he took note of the judgment but added: ""I regret that girls will not have the opportunity to make their way through the education system free from compulsion."" Austria's Islamic Faith Community, which represents the country's Muslims and brought the legal challenge, welcomed the ruling. The wearing of Islamic headscarves has been a controversial topic in Austria ""Ensuring equal opportunities and self-determination for girls and women in our society is not achieved through bans,"" it said in a statement. When the legislation was first proposed in 2018, Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said the goal was to ""confront any development of parallel societies in Austria"". Vice-Chancellor Heinz Christian Strache, of the Freedom Party, said the government wanted to protect young girls from political Islam. The ban came into force in May 2019, just days after Mr Strache was forced to resign after being secretly filmed offering public contracts to a woman posing as a Russian oligarch's niece. Mystery of the honey-trap video that shook Austria The People's Party is now in coalition with the Green Party, but the government had still intended to extend the headscarf ban up to the age of 14. The coalition's current programme stipulates that children should grow up ""with as little coercion as possible"". The only example it gives is the wearing of headscarves.

"Inquiry chairwoman Prof Alexis Jay was the fourth person to lead the probe An inquiry into claims of child sexual abuse in England and Wales has finished its final public hearing. The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse heard evidence from 648 witnesses over four years. It is investigating claims against local authorities, religious organisations, the armed forces and public and private institutions - as well as people in the public eye. The inquiry's final report will be published in 2022. IICSA was set up in July 2014 after hundreds of people came forward to say Jimmy Savile had abused them as children. But it was initially beset with controversy, with three chairwomen resigning and lawyers quitting their posts. In 2016 current chairwoman, Prof Alexis Jay, who led the Rotherham abuse inquiry, wasappointed to the role. The IICSA has held 323 days of public hearings and disclosed 24,565 documents totalling more than  590,000 pages. The hearings have led to 14 reports so far - with a further five due to be published next year -containing 53 recommendations to better protect children from sexual abuse. The inquiry has investigated allegations of abuse against Lord Janner, who died in 2015 Speaking at the end of the public hearings, Prof Jay thanked the witnesses who had contributed to the inquiry's 15 investigations. ""A vast amount of work has gone into making these hearings possible over the last four years, including earlier this year when we became the UK's first public inquiry to hear evidence in a virtual setting following the outbreak of Covid-19. ""While this is a significant milestone for the inquiry, we still have a busy programme of work to complete in the coming year. ""This will cover research and investigation reports, which will all contribute to our final report."" The inquiry's public hearings consisted of 15 separate investigations. The inquiry is investigating: the institutional responses to the sexual exploitation of children by organised abuse networks alleged failings at Lambeth Council; the Roman Catholic Church; residential schools and the support services and legal remedies available to victims and survivors current child protection policies and practices in religious institutions in England and Wales - including non-conformist Christian denominations, Islam, Judaism, Sikhism and Buddhism, as well as tuition classes, groups and camps linked to religious beliefs the effective leadership of child protection institutions tasked with safeguarding them against sexual abuse the institutional responses to child sexual abuse allegations against the late Lord Janner, the former Labour peer who in 2015 was ruled unfit to stand trial on child sex abuse charges How the child sexual abuse inquiry works Last month, a report from the inquiry concluded the head of the Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales hadfailed to show compassion towards victimsof abuse within the Church.

"This video can not be played Bex Williams: I survived a fire but counselling saved my life A woman who survived a fatal fire started by her boyfriend's brother has thanked a charity she says saved her life. Rebecca Williams, known as Bex, was asleep in Cameron Logan's family home, in Milngavie, when his brother Blair set him alight in January 2017. Cameron, 23, died in the blaze while Bex was left seriously injured from burns and smoke inhalation. She turned toThe Manda Centre,externalcharity during dark days later that year. The centre was launched by Joe Duffy, whose daughter Amanda was murdered in Hamilton in 1992. Bex spent weeks in hospital and needed a tracheostomy following the fire ""I've never been the sort of person who would have thought I would reach the stage where I've considered taking my own life but I was pretty lost,"" she said. ""I was so angry all the time. I'd lost my partner, my sense of self worth and respect. ""I literally reached out to them when I felt I couldn't control it anymore. I would be frightened to think what would happen if I hadn't found them."" Cameron Logan: 'He was the love of my life' Bex told how she was one of the 180,000 people shielding from March until July this year and was receiving government food parcels. She said the isolation she experienced gave her ""too much time to think"" - but that The Manda Centre continued to support her. Blair Logan sentenced to life imprisonment over fire murder 'The horror will haunt me forever' ""Everyone's lockdown experience is so different, people are at home with family or partners and I was myself,"" Bex said. ""I kept going 'well if Cameron was here we would be in lockdown together and it wouldn't be as bad'. ""[The centre] is really good. I can lift the phone whenever, talk about anything I'm upset about and they're never too busy or they never can't fit me in."" In August 2017 Blair Logan was ordered to spend at least 20 years in prison after heconfessed to the attack. Bex spent weeks in hospital, needed a tracheostomy which affected her voice and eventually left her job in broadcast journalism to work for Police Scotland. Bex has spoken out praising the work of The Manda Charity, which supports people affected by trauma and loss She said counselling has helped her deal with the ongoing challenges she faces in her working life. ""Naturally with my partner being murdered there are sometimes triggers in my work to do with murder, fire or violent crime,"" Bex said. ""I felt so far removed from everything normal, but it was just such a relief when I found the centre and I explained all this to them. ""I remember my first session I just broke down crying because it was such a release to explain all this to somebody and have them understand. I felt completely supported, like a family or community there.""

More than 50 MPs had already called for the increase to be cancelled. Many reacted positively to news of the pay freeze. Labour's Catherine West tweeted that ""anything else would have been an insult to public sector workers,"" while Conservative James Cartlidge said it was ""absolutely the right thing to do"". MPs' basic salary is currently Â£81,932 a year, and is more if they serve as government ministers. Ministers' salaries have also been frozen for a year. IPSA's formula for MPs' pay is linked to any increase in average pay for public sector workers,millions of whom have had their pay frozen. Overall,average wages have fallen in real terms this year.,external In November, Boris Johnson's spokesman saidthe prime minister did not think MPs should receive a pay rise for 2021, ""given the circumstances"". And in October, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said ""this year of all years""the money should go to key workers on the front line of the pandemic response,external. IPSA, which was set up in the wake of theMPs' expenses scandal, said: ""It is clear that applying the forthcoming official statistic for public sector earnings growth would result in a salary increase for MPs that would be inconsistent with the wider economic data and would not reflect the reality that many constituents are facing this year. ""The IPSA Board has therefore decided that the salary for Members of Parliament will remain unchanged for the financial year 2021/22.""

"Deschamps (left) and Cantona (right) played together in the 1990s but fell out A defamation case brought by France's football team manager Didier Deschamps against his former teammate Eric Cantona has been declared void. The court in Paris ruled that the complaint had not clearly defined the case for defamation. Deschamps has 10 days to appeal. Deschamps sued Cantona over comments he made ahead of Euro 2016. He appeared to suggest Deschamps left out two players from the French squad because of their African origin. With reference to Karim Benzema and Hatem Ben Arfa,Cantona told the Guardian newspaper at the time,external: ""Benzema is a great player. Ben Arfa is a great player. ""But Deschamps, he has a really French name. Maybe he is the only one in France to have a truly French name,"" the former Manchester United striker said. Lawyers for French manager Didier Deschamps called Cantona's remarks ""slanderous and defamatory"" He went on to say: ""Ben Arfa is maybe the best player in France today. But they have some origins. I am allowed to think about that."" Deschamps' lawyer at the time called the remarks ""unacceptable, slanderous and defamatory"". Benzema was not selected to play in the European Championship after he was issued with a domestic ban for his involvement in an alleged blackmail scandal over a sex tape. Ben Arfa stayed on the standby list. Cantona's lawyer welcomed Friday's court ruling, claiming it a ""victory"", and saying ""justice had been done"". Eric Cantona, seen here at former club Manchester United, pledged his support for England over France during Euro 2016 Cantona and Deschamps, who are former France teammates, have fallen out numerous times since they played together in the mid-1990s. Cantona previously called Deschamps a ""muppet"" and a ""vulgar water carrier"", a football insult implying Deschamps was good only to pass the ball to others. Cantona was dropped from the French national team in 1995 after he attacked a fan during a Manchester United game with a kung fu-style kick, and never played for France again.

"Inquiry chairwoman Prof Alexis Jay was the fourth person to lead the probe An inquiry into claims of child sexual abuse in England and Wales has finished its final public hearing. The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse heard evidence from 648 witnesses over four years. It is investigating claims against local authorities, religious organisations, the armed forces and public and private institutions - as well as people in the public eye. The inquiry's final report will be published in 2022. IICSA was set up in July 2014 after hundreds of people came forward to say Jimmy Savile had abused them as children. But it was initially beset with controversy, with three chairwomen resigning and lawyers quitting their posts. In 2016 current chairwoman, Prof Alexis Jay, who led the Rotherham abuse inquiry, wasappointed to the role. The IICSA has held 323 days of public hearings and disclosed 24,565 documents totalling more than  590,000 pages. The hearings have led to 14 reports so far - with a further five due to be published next year -containing 53 recommendations to better protect children from sexual abuse. The inquiry has investigated allegations of abuse against Lord Janner, who died in 2015 Speaking at the end of the public hearings, Prof Jay thanked the witnesses who had contributed to the inquiry's 15 investigations. ""A vast amount of work has gone into making these hearings possible over the last four years, including earlier this year when we became the UK's first public inquiry to hear evidence in a virtual setting following the outbreak of Covid-19. ""While this is a significant milestone for the inquiry, we still have a busy programme of work to complete in the coming year. ""This will cover research and investigation reports, which will all contribute to our final report."" The inquiry's public hearings consisted of 15 separate investigations. The inquiry is investigating: the institutional responses to the sexual exploitation of children by organised abuse networks alleged failings at Lambeth Council; the Roman Catholic Church; residential schools and the support services and legal remedies available to victims and survivors current child protection policies and practices in religious institutions in England and Wales - including non-conformist Christian denominations, Islam, Judaism, Sikhism and Buddhism, as well as tuition classes, groups and camps linked to religious beliefs the effective leadership of child protection institutions tasked with safeguarding them against sexual abuse the institutional responses to child sexual abuse allegations against the late Lord Janner, the former Labour peer who in 2015 was ruled unfit to stand trial on child sex abuse charges How the child sexual abuse inquiry works Last month, a report from the inquiry concluded the head of the Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales hadfailed to show compassion towards victimsof abuse within the Church.

"A man dubbed Osama Bin Laden's spokesman in Europe has returned to the UK after being released from a US jail. Adel Abdul Bary was deported after a senior New York judge concluded the prisoner had a high risk of contracting Covid-19, partly because of his weight. In 1998, Bary was the Europe-based publicist for al-Qaeda leaders and told journalists that the terror group had bombed US embassies in east Africa. MI5 and counter-terrorism police are reviewing his return and resettlement. In 1999, Scotland Yard detectives arrested Bary as a co-conspirator to the embassy attacks. More than 200 people were killed in Nairobi and Dar Es Salaam - al-Qaeda's then biggest single attack against American targets. That arrest - and those of other major UK-based suspects - triggered a mammoth extradition battle that lasted until 2012, when he was eventually flown to the US. He went on to admit helping to plan the bombings. His confession to a federal court in Manhattan confirmed that, working out of London, he had sent messages from journalists to Osama bin Laden - and also faxed news organisations confirming al-Qaeda had been behind the embassy attacks. In October this year, US authorities approved Bary's release after he had served 21 years of his 25-year sentence. His release had been pencilled in for the end of the year, after US authorities took into account the 14 years he had spent in prison in the UK before his extradition and his good behaviour since then. The US embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, was targeted by a bomb in August 1998 But it was brought forward slightly after a court heard evidence that he had a high risk of catching and dying from Covid, if he was kept in prison any longer. In the October ruling sanctioning Bary's release, US federal Judge Lewis Kaplan said that mercy should allow the offender to be with his family, given it may be the final period of his life. ""The [US] government concedes that the defendant has provided extraordinary and compelling reasons for his release,"" said the judge. ""The government notes that the defendant was diagnosed as obese in 2019 and that, as of April 2020, his body mass index was 36, which is well above the threshold for obesity. ""On that basis, the government concedes that defendant has presented an extraordinary and compelling circumstance [for release]. Following his release from a federal jail, US immigration officials took him to a detention centre before putting him on a flight to the UK on Tuesday. After arriving in London, Bary - who is Egyptian - is believed to have been taken to his family home. The now 60-year-old's US lawyer previously told journalists his client now wished to live a quiet life. When prisoners convicted of terrorism offences are released from jail in the UK, the case for continuing to monitor them is considered by a team of police and probation officers, who also take into account intelligence from MI5. Some offenders quietly get on with their lives and are eventually placed on the Security Service's massive list of former terrorism suspects. Others who have maintained ties with extremists - or try to resurrect them after years in jail - are subject to ongoing investigations. Next year, inquests will be held into how one released offender went on to murder two people in London in 2019.

"People in Wales were asked to stay at home during a 17-day ""firebreak"" lockdown that ended on 9 November A senior Conservative has demanded clarity from Welsh ministers after reports they are considering severe Covid restrictions from 28 December. LBC radiocited an industry source,externalsaying Wales will be placed into lockdown-equivalent rules after Christmas. Andrew RT Davies said first minister Mark Drakeford should make an ""urgent statement"". The Welsh Government said ministers are keeping all measures under review. Rules will be relaxed for five days during the Christmas period, 23-27 December, across the UK to allow three households to meet. However ministers have disclosed discussions about further restrictions after Christmas have already taken place. Secondary schools 'move online' Government at limit for 'telling people what to do' on Covid NHS faces 'difficult choices', says minister The number of patients in Welsh hospitals isthe highest ever recorded, and case rates in more than half of council areas in Wales reached theirhighest levels yetduring the pandemic. Plaid Cymru Adam Price claimed the Welsh Government ""seems to have lost its grip on the situation"". Welsh Conservative health spokesman Mr Davies said demanded ""a full and frank disclosure"" from the Welsh Government's plans to control the rise.Â LBC said an 'industry source' told them it is likely Wales would go into lockdown-equivalent restrictions from 28 December.

The Welsh Government has not yet announced what it intends to do after Christmas It comes after the Welsh Government announced all secondary schools and further education colleges in Wales will move classes onlinefrom Monday. Plaid's Adam Price called for a regional approach if a tiered system is to be introduced, ""where local restrictions reflect local virus transmission levels"". ""Rather than blaming the public, ministers should be asking themselves where they've gone wrong,"" he said. ""With furlough being reviewed in January, the Welsh Government must give urgent assurances that there will be further financial support if the hospitality sector has to close completely for a period of time."" A spokeswoman said the public has a ""key role"" to play in limiting the spread of the virus. ""How we all act - and the choices we all make over the coming days and weeks - will define the course of this virus,"" she said. ""We have recently introduced new restrictions to control the spread of the virus, but this will take some time to have an impact. ""Ministers keep all measures under review, including whether additional actions are needed to help further control the spread of the virus.

of the Christmas break despite concerns among European countries about the possible spread of infections. Many resorts have delayed their opening due to the pandemic, but resorts
in Catalonia are set to open on Monday 14 November, according to AFP news agency. Special measures are in place in Spain's resorts, such asreduced
capacity on lifts and in restaurants and bars.,external Other countries such as France, Germany and Italy will keep its
resorts closed over the Christmas period. Italy, supported by Germany, wanted a European agreement to close
all ski resorts over the holiday. However, ski resorts in countries including
Spain, Switzerland and Austriaall released plans to
open. Warner Bros will release its live action Tom and Jerry both online and in cinemas The company that owns the UK's Odeon Cinemas has secured $100m (Â£76m) in emergency funds amid concerns about Covid-19 - but warned the money will only help it through another month. AMC Entertainment Holdings, the world's largest movie theatre operator, said attendance has dropped 92% in the US and 86% internationally. The pandemic has meant that some cinemas have shut and audiences have stayed away. The company is burning through $125m a month. ""Our current cash burn rates are not sustainable,"" it said. Even once cinemas reopened this year, it said the growth of streaming posed a challenge. Warner Bros this month said it planned to release all of its 2021 films online on the same day they are released to cinemas. They will air on the HBO Max streaming service, with which it shares a parent company. Disney has also said it plans to push more of its films to its Disney+ streaming service.

South Africa's top judge says he is unconcerned about criticism after a video showing him falsely suggesting that Covid-19 vaccines could alter people's DNA and insert satanic elements within them was widely shared online. Speaking to the media on Friday, Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng said he expected a backlash for the comments he made on Thursday at a prayer event. He told reporters that he was concerned about a report he saw that suggested that the Covid-19 vaccine would be mandatory. ""It must be voluntary... You can't impose a vaccine on people. Why should you?""news site EWN quotes the judge as saying.,external His opinion on Covid-19 vaccines has divided South Africans. There have been concerns that rich countries may be buying up most of the newly developed vaccines, not leaving enough for countries in Africa, although both Nigeria and Uganda have said they have ordered millions of doses. A study of coronavirus patients in intensive care has found that
some people become more susceptible to severe Covid-19 symptoms than others. Scientists looked into the DNA of more than 2,200 patients in UK
hospitals. They looked at each personâs genes, which contain the instructions
for every biological process â including how to fight a virus. Their genomes were then compared with those of healthy people to
pinpoint any genetic differences. The findings shed light on where the immune system goes wrong,
which could help identify new treatments. You can read

In projections released on Friday, the agency predicts at
least 90,000 more cases by Christmas Day - but says this figure could reach 135,000. It alsoestimated that there could be between 1,300 and 1,800 deaths in the weeks leading up to by 25 December,external. More than 445,000 cases have been confirmed in Canada and 13,130
people have died since the pandemic began. Chief Public Health Officer Theresa Tam said ""a stronger
response is needed now in all large provinces to slow the spread of Covid-19"". Canada's health regulator approved the Pfizer-BioNTech
vaccine the day after the UK became the first country in the world to roll it
out. Health Canada said thevaccine met its ""stringent safety, efficacy and quality requirements"". Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada will receive
up to 249,000 doses of the vaccine this month. The Canadian government has
purchased 20 million doses of the vaccine - enough to inoculate 10 million
people - with the option to buy 56 million more. A new-born giraffe has been named Margaret in honour of the world's first Covid vaccine patient. Staff at Whipsnade Zoo in Bedfordshire picked the name because the female calf was born on Tuesday - thesame day Margaret Keenan, 90, received the Pfizer/BioNTech jab in Coventry. She was the first person to receive the jab outside of a clinical trial. Team leader Mark Holden said: ""The arrival of our precious giraffe calf on the same day, and actually at the same time, as the much-anticipated Covid-19 vaccination was first administered feels like a real moment of hope, and one we are so keen to celebrate and remember."" The zoo says it hopes Mrs Keenan will be able to visit her namesake one day soon. It might be found at the bottom of the globe, but New Zealand has been at the top of the movie industry in 2020. Thanks to its handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, the country is enjoying an unprecedented boom in film production, with directors seeking safe conditions, and that most elusive thing this year - a normal life. International blockbusters including James Cameron's Avatar sequels, Amazon's Lord of the Rings series and Jane Campion's The Power of the Dog - starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Kirsten Dunst - all managed complex film shoots in New Zealand this year. The country's home-grown movies have also received a boost at the box office by Kiwis supporting their industry, leading one local filmmaker to joke that they're now living in ""the Hollywood of the Pacific"". New Zealand, like so many other countries, did experience a lockdown in March, But because it managed to eliminate community transmission of the virus,apart from an incident in Auckland in August,film production could resume by summer, with Avatar one of the first projects to start up again. Read more on this story from the BBC's Emma Jones here. Pallab GhoshScience correspondent, BBC News The latest estimate of the R number for the UK is 0.9 and 1 â up very slightly on the previous week â according to the latest Office for National Statistics infection survey This means that the epidemic is still shrinking after lockdown measures, but very slowly. The survey indicates that cases continued to fall in most of England and Northern Ireland last week. But the view of the governmentâs scientific advisors is that the situation is fragile. Cases are increasing in London and the East of England â especially among secondary school age children â and previous experience indicates that a surge among older age groups will inevitably follow. The advisors believe that it will be important to keep infection levels as low as possible in the run up to the holidays. Thatâs because the relaxation of restrictions that permit families to meet over Christmas will accelerate any increase in cases â and lead to another sharp spike in infections early in the New Year. Students aged 14 to 16 will switch to remote learning in
Sweden's capital, Stockholm, local authorities have announced. Lessons should be switched to online as
soon as possible, they added. ""We need to dramatically reduce the amount of contact between one another, "" said Maria Rotzen Ostlund,the region's infectious diseases doctor,external. She said that distance learning would not be enough and
stressed the importance of limiting social contacts to as few people as
possible. Ostlund also recommended that employers allow their staff
to work from home where possible. Stockholm is one of the worst affected regions in the
country, accounting for a third of Sweden's confirmed Covid-related death toll, according to Reuters news agency. The Swedish government is aiming to offer the vaccine to all of thoseover the age of 18 during the first half of 2021.,external Sweden has recorded 312,728 cases and 7,354 deaths since the
pandemic began, according to Johns Hopkins University. A recommended Â£3,300 pay rise for UK MPs has been scrapped over concerns it would ""not reflect the reality"" the public is facing during the pandemic. The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority ordered a pay freeze for the next financial year. The basic salary for MPs is currently Â£79,468-a-year, and many were already promising to refuse or give away the extra money at a time when many of their constituents were struggling. Prime Minister Boris Johnson had also joined Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer in urging the IPSA not to go ahead with its plans. The rise was set in October - based on the official statistic for public sector earnings growth.  But IPSA came under more pressure to scrap it after thechancellor imposed a pay cap on millions of public sector workersbecause of the financial impact of Covid on government finances. IPSA chairman Richard Lloyd wrote to MPs saying a pay rise ""would result in a salary increase for MPs that would be inconsistent with the wider economic data and would not reflect the reality that many constituents are facing this year"".

This video can not be played The World Health Organization's regional director for Europe, Hans Kluge, has backed a warning from German Chancellor Angela Merkel that it will take some time for the new coronavirus vaccines to turn the pandemic around. Mrs Merkel told the German parliament the country would not be able to vaccinate enough of its citizens to change the course of the pandemic in the first quarter of 2021. Mr Kluge said the delayed effects of vaccination programmes highlighted the need to prioritise key workers and vulnerable groups first. He also warned of the effects of relaxing rules too much around Christmas: ""I am very concerned. Now every 17 seconds someone is dying of Covid-19, which may double if people are relaxing,"" he told BBC World News. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst People are screened at a clinic in Huanggang, in China's central Hubei province (file photo) A number of people in central China have been fined and
told to self-isolate after they bought imported pork online that could potentially
have been contaminated with Covid-19. According to the national Global Times newspaper, 24
residents in Huanggang, central Hubei province, have been fined 200 yuan
(Â£23; $30.50) for buying imported pork from Brazil via the Meituan shopping
platform. The pork should have been destroyed rather than sold because, as
the newspaper notes,batches had already tested positive for Covid-19,external. An investigation is now being carried out into the
shopping platform. One of the big concerns in China is how imported food might carry the virus, and so the country is stepping up regulation to
prevent ordinary consumers from directly getting their hands on such goods. This week, China's top court announced that e-commerce platforms
could be ""held legally responsible for food safety issues,externalrelated to products
purchased on their platforms"". China says that many of its localised Covid-19 outbreaks over the
last year have been linked to imported cold-chain goods, and there are regular
news stories about coastal regions discovering the virus on overseas goods.
Many of the first patients in cities that have experienced outbreaks have been
workers who handle such products. UK airport operator Heathrow has said it will keep Terminal 4 closed until the end of next year as the pandemic continues to affect travel. The company said passenger numbers at the airport - usually one of the busiest in the world - fell 88% in November ""as travel restrictions and a second lockdown took their toll"". Based on forecasts and current traffic, it said it would extend the closure of Terminal 4 until the end of 2021. Heathrow shut the terminal in May during the first national lockdown. It led to airlines such as Air France, Etihad and KLM moving to Terminal 2. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Teaching will move online from Monday in Wales Wales' secondary school system ""must reinvent itself in a day again"", a headmaster has said. Ian Loynd, of St Teilo's in Cardiff was respondingto Thursday's announcement all secondary schoolsand colleges would move work online from Monday. He said it gave parents and carers insufficient time to make arrangements. Parent Clare Ferguson-Walker said it was ""the right decision"", claiming schools were unable to manage social distancing. Meanwhile ColegauCymru, which represents further education colleges in Wales, said learning would remain online for the first week of 2021, from 4-8 January, with students returning to the classroom on 11 January. The majority of Wales' councils have also said their primary schools will be closing early before the Christmas break, with learning moved online and classes only open for vulnerable children and those of key workers. ""It's always a rapidly changing position and the news came late,"" Mr Loynd toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfast. ""Heads had been asking (about the possibility of an early closure) for a number of weeks."" But despite questioning the fact there was only one working day's notice, Mr Loynd agreed it was ""the right decision"". Secondary schools 'move online' from Monday Christmas fears sees parents pull children from school He said it came down to a choice between the inevitable ""families voting with their feet"" and keeping children home, or changing teaching in a ""calm and controlled way"", as he believes it will be by Monday. Mr Loynd pointed to the earlier lockdown as giving teachers experience of managing homeworking, adding: ""I can only hope we are open in the new year as planned, but we will have to see as the position changes. ""My view is the best place for children is the classroom, but it has to be safe."" He said his school had been tracking more than 30 coronavirus cases a day, with almost 500 in total since the start of the pandemic and 33 positive involving children. ""In 16 years as a teacher, this is the hardest I've faced. But 99.5% of teaching has still been face-to-face,"" he said. ""Just 0.5% has been lost. So while it's been difficult, it's working."" Several local authorities had already announced they would shut schools early Students at St Teilo's Church in Wales High School in Cardiff have been giving their views - and they are less than impressed. ""I'm a bit like gutted, as I'd rather go to school, because I don't like working from home. But it is what it is - and I'm still learning,"" said one male pupil. Another female pupil added: ""They could have just told us (earlier) so we were more prepared. ""We could have done our work more in the time of school and got it all done rather than being told the day before and being stressed about doing the online lessons, and feeling like we don't have the resources we have in school and stuff, and having limited contact with our teachers."" This sixth-form A-level student at the school said he was becoming increasingly frustrated: ""Our education has already been disturbed enough with the previous lockdowns. I feel as though it is taking away from our education. ""I really feel they are mixing up my education, which I'm not really a fan of. I don't really know what is going on. It's quite scary really."" In numbers, since September 3,032cases among pupils 2,127cases in staff 1,573schools with at least one case 861cases in the most recent six days 10schools have had more than 20 cases Clare Ferguson-Walker, from Tavernspite, Pembrokeshire, said she has one son in year eight and another child who is home educated, and that she was ""really glad"" the decision had been made. ""I'm surprised it didn't happen before this,"" she said. ""They haven't been able to properly police social distancing and my son has been coming home telling me who he's been wrestling with."" While she understands it will be hard for some parents, she added: ""I'll get the tree up this weekend and make it as magical as possible."" Wales' Education Minister Kirsty Williams said on Thursday closures were part of a ""national effort to reduce transmission of coronavirus"". ""Every day, we are seeing more and more people admitted to hospital with coronavirus symptoms,"" she said. ""The virus is putting our health service under significant and sustained pressure and it is important we all make a contribution to reduce its transmission."" The announcement does not extend to primary or special schools, with the education minister ""encouraging"" them to remain open. However, a number of local authorities have announced they will also be halting face-to-face learning in primaries early. The Children's Commissioner for Wales Sally Holland says she does not support closing schools early But Children's Commissioner Sally Holland said the move was ""not the right decision"" for children and young people in Wales and had yet to see any scientific advice to support the move. ""Whilst accepting the severity of the public health emergency and the responsibilities all of us have to keep each other safe, this decision compounds the disruption to our children's education over the last few months,"" she said. Ms Holland said her ""hope and expectation"" was schools would reopen in January. ""It's hard to get it right, but you have to look at it from the perspective of children who have missed so much,"" she added. After repeatedly resisting calls to move to online learning, the government's decision came at the eleventh hour. Even many of those that welcomed it raise concerns about the fact teachers and families have only a day of school time left to address the changed situation they face next week. It has been presented as offering ""clear, national direction"" but the announcement sparked a flurry of different local announcements cutting short face-to-face teaching in primary schools too. The education minister said her decision was driven by the latest advice by the chief medical officer, while accepting that young people have paid a heavy price during this pandemic. This is another week out of school, with the possibility of further disruption to the start of next term.

Warner Bros will release its live action Tom and Jerry both online and in cinemas The company that owns the UK's Odeon Cinemas has secured $100m (Â£76m) in emergency funds amid concerns about Covid-19 - but warned the money will only help it through another month. AMC Entertainment Holdings, the world's largest movie theatre operator, said attendance has dropped 92% in the US and 86% internationally. The pandemic has meant that some cinemas have shut and audiences have stayed away. The company is burning through $125m a month. ""Our current cash burn rates are not sustainable,"" it said. Even once cinemas reopened this year, it said the growth of streaming posed a challenge. Warner Bros this month said it planned to release all of its 2021 films online on the same day they are released to cinemas.

South Africa's top judge says he is unconcerned about criticism after a video showing him falsely suggesting that Covid-19 vaccines could alter people's DNA and insert satanic elements within them was widely shared online. Speaking to the media on Friday, Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng said he expected a backlash for the comments he made on Thursday at a prayer event. He told reporters that he was concerned about a report he saw that suggested that the Covid-19 vaccine would be mandatory. ""It must be voluntary... You can't impose a vaccine on people. Why should you?""news site EWN quotes the judge as saying.,external His opinion on Covid-19 vaccines has divided South Africans. There have been concerns that rich countries may be buying up most of the newly developed vaccines, not leaving enough for countries in Africa, although both Nigeria and Uganda have said they have ordered millions of doses. A study of coronavirus patients in intensive care has found that
some people become more susceptible to severe Covid-19 symptoms than others. Scientists looked into the DNA of more than 2,200 patients in UK
hospitals. They looked at each personâs genes, which contain the instructions
for every biological process â including how to fight a virus. Their genomes were then compared with those of healthy people to
pinpoint any genetic differences. The findings shed light on where the immune system goes wrong,
which could help identify new treatments. You can read

Staff at Whipsnade Zoo in Bedfordshire picked the name because the female calf was born on Tuesday - thesame day Margaret Keenan, 90, received the Pfizer/BioNTech jab in Coventry. She was the first person to receive the jab outside of a clinical trial. Team leader Mark Holden said: ""The arrival of our precious giraffe calf on the same day, and actually at the same time, as the much-anticipated Covid-19 vaccination was first administered feels like a real moment of hope, and one we are so keen to celebrate and remember.""

Pallab GhoshScience correspondent, BBC News The latest estimate of the R number for the UK is 0.9 and 1 â up very slightly on the previous week â according to the latest Office for National Statistics infection survey This means that the epidemic is still shrinking after lockdown measures, but very slowly. The survey indicates that cases continued to fall in most of England and Northern Ireland last week. But the view of the governmentâs scientific advisors is that the situation is fragile. Cases are increasing in London and the East of England â especially among secondary school age children â and previous experience indicates that a surge among older age groups will inevitably follow. The advisors believe that it will be important to keep infection levels as low as possible in the run up to the holidays. Thatâs because the relaxation of restrictions that permit families to meet over Christmas will accelerate any increase in cases â and lead to another sharp spike in infections early in the New Year. Students aged 14 to 16 will switch to remote learning in
Sweden's capital, Stockholm, local authorities have announced. Lessons should be switched to online as

stressed the importance of limiting social contacts to as few people as
possible. Ostlund also recommended that employers allow their staff

The basic salary for MPs is currently Â£79,468-a-year, and many were already promising to refuse or give away the extra money at a time when many of their constituents were struggling. Prime Minister Boris Johnson had also joined Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer in urging the IPSA not to go ahead with its plans. The rise was set in October - based on the official statistic for public sector earnings growth.  But IPSA came under more pressure to scrap it after thechancellor imposed a pay cap on millions of public sector workersbecause of the financial impact of Covid on government finances. IPSA chairman Richard Lloyd wrote to MPs saying a pay rise ""would result in a salary increase for MPs that would be inconsistent with the wider economic data and would not reflect the reality that many constituents are facing this year"".

Mrs Merkel told the German parliament the country would not be able to vaccinate enough of its citizens to change the course of the pandemic in the first quarter of 2021. Mr Kluge said the delayed effects of vaccination programmes highlighted the need to prioritise key workers and vulnerable groups first. He also warned of the effects of relaxing rules too much around Christmas: ""I am very concerned. Now every 17 seconds someone is dying of Covid-19, which may double if people are relaxing,"" he told BBC World News.

Here's what you need to know about the pandemic in the UK before we do: Ski resorts in Spain have announced that they will be opening ahead
of the Christmas break despite concerns among European countries about the possible spread of infections. Many resorts have delayed their opening due to the pandemic, but resorts
in Catalonia are set to open on Monday 14 November, according to AFP news agency. Special measures are in place in Spain's resorts, such asreduced
capacity on lifts and in restaurants and bars.,external Other countries such as France, Germany and Italy will keep its
resorts closed over the Christmas period. Italy, supported by Germany, wanted a European agreement to close
all ski resorts over the holiday. However, ski resorts in countries including
Spain, Switzerland and Austriaall released plans to
open. Warner Bros will release its live action Tom and Jerry both online and in cinemas The company that owns the UK's Odeon Cinemas has secured $100m (Â£76m) in emergency funds amid concerns about Covid-19 - but warned the money will only help it through another month. AMC Entertainment Holdings, the world's largest movie theatre operator, said attendance has dropped 92% in the US and 86% internationally. The pandemic has meant that some cinemas have shut and audiences have stayed away. The company is burning through $125m a month. ""Our current cash burn rates are not sustainable,"" it said. Even once cinemas reopened this year, it said the growth of streaming posed a challenge. Warner Bros this month said it planned to release all of its 2021 films online on the same day they are released to cinemas. They will air on the HBO Max streaming service, with which it shares a parent company. Disney has also said it plans to push more of its films to its Disney+ streaming service.

South Africa's top judge says he is unconcerned about criticism after a video showing him falsely suggesting that Covid-19 vaccines could alter people's DNA and insert satanic elements within them was widely shared online. Speaking to the media on Friday, Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng said he expected a backlash for the comments he made on Thursday at a prayer event. He told reporters that he was concerned about a report he saw that suggested that the Covid-19 vaccine would be mandatory. ""It must be voluntary... You can't impose a vaccine on people. Why should you?""news site EWN quotes the judge as saying.,external His opinion on Covid-19 vaccines has divided South Africans. There have been concerns that rich countries may be buying up most of the newly developed vaccines, not leaving enough for countries in Africa, although both Nigeria and Uganda have said they have ordered millions of doses. A study of coronavirus patients in intensive care has found that
some people become more susceptible to severe Covid-19 symptoms than others. Scientists looked into the DNA of more than 2,200 patients in UK
hospitals. They looked at each personâs genes, which contain the instructions
for every biological process â including how to fight a virus. Their genomes were then compared with those of healthy people to
pinpoint any genetic differences. The findings shed light on where the immune system goes wrong,
which could help identify new treatments. You can read

About 2,000 troops were deployed to Liverpool in November Army regiments that helped set up and run a mass coronavirus testing pilot in Liverpool are to be given the Freedom of the City - the city's the highest civic honour. Around 2,000 troops were deployed to Liverpool in November, where they helped carry out 200,000 tests at almost 50 centres. The city's coronavirus infection rates have since dropped from 680 cases per 100,000 people to fewer than 100. It enabled the city region to move down from tier three to tier two when the national lockdown ended. Brigadier Joe Fossey, commander of the 8th Engineer Brigade, which led the operation, said he was ""extremely proud of what we have all achieved in such a short time and how warmly we have been received by all those in the city"". ""To receive Liverpool's highest civic honour crowns an extraordinary six weeks for all of us and marks an important moment in the continuing fight against Covid-19,"" he added. Read full story here.

In projections released on Friday, the agency predicts at
least 90,000 more cases by Christmas Day - but says this figure could reach 135,000. It alsoestimated that there could be between 1,300 and 1,800 deaths in the weeks leading up to by 25 December,external. More than 445,000 cases have been confirmed in Canada and 13,130

vaccine the day after the UK became the first country in the world to roll it
out. Health Canada said thevaccine met its ""stringent safety, efficacy and quality requirements"". Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada will receive
up to 249,000 doses of the vaccine this month. The Canadian government has
purchased 20 million doses of the vaccine - enough to inoculate 10 million
people - with the option to buy 56 million more. A new-born giraffe has been named Margaret in honour of the world's first Covid vaccine patient. Staff at Whipsnade Zoo in Bedfordshire picked the name because the female calf was born on Tuesday - thesame day Margaret Keenan, 90, received the Pfizer/BioNTech jab in Coventry. She was the first person to receive the jab outside of a clinical trial. Team leader Mark Holden said: ""The arrival of our precious giraffe calf on the same day, and actually at the same time, as the much-anticipated Covid-19 vaccination was first administered feels like a real moment of hope, and one we are so keen to celebrate and remember."" The zoo says it hopes Mrs Keenan will be able to visit her namesake one day soon. It might be found at the bottom of the globe, but New Zealand has been at the top of the movie industry in 2020. Thanks to its handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, the country is enjoying an unprecedented boom in film production, with directors seeking safe conditions, and that most elusive thing this year - a normal life. International blockbusters including James Cameron's Avatar sequels, Amazon's Lord of the Rings series and Jane Campion's The Power of the Dog - starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Kirsten Dunst - all managed complex film shoots in New Zealand this year. The country's home-grown movies have also received a boost at the box office by Kiwis supporting their industry, leading one local filmmaker to joke that they're now living in ""the Hollywood of the Pacific"". New Zealand, like so many other countries, did experience a lockdown in March, But because it managed to eliminate community transmission of the virus,apart from an incident in Auckland in August,film production could resume by summer, with Avatar one of the first projects to start up again. Read more on this story from the BBC's Emma Jones here. Pallab GhoshScience correspondent, BBC News The latest estimate of the R number for the UK is 0.9 and 1 â up very slightly on the previous week â according to the latest Office for National Statistics infection survey This means that the epidemic is still shrinking after lockdown measures, but very slowly. The survey indicates that cases continued to fall in most of England and Northern Ireland last week. But the view of the governmentâs scientific advisors is that the situation is fragile. Cases are increasing in London and the East of England â especially among secondary school age children â and previous experience indicates that a surge among older age groups will inevitably follow. The advisors believe that it will be important to keep infection levels as low as possible in the run up to the holidays. Thatâs because the relaxation of restrictions that permit families to meet over Christmas will accelerate any increase in cases â and lead to another sharp spike in infections early in the New Year. Students aged 14 to 16 will switch to remote learning in
Sweden's capital, Stockholm, local authorities have announced. Lessons should be switched to online as
soon as possible, they added. ""We need to dramatically reduce the amount of contact between one another, "" said Maria Rotzen Ostlund,the region's infectious diseases doctor,external. She said that distance learning would not be enough and
stressed the importance of limiting social contacts to as few people as
possible. Ostlund also recommended that employers allow their staff
to work from home where possible. Stockholm is one of the worst affected regions in the
country, accounting for a third of Sweden's confirmed Covid-related death toll, according to Reuters news agency. The Swedish government is aiming to offer the vaccine to all of thoseover the age of 18 during the first half of 2021.,external Sweden has recorded 312,728 cases and 7,354 deaths since the
pandemic began, according to Johns Hopkins University.

"MPs will not be awarded a pay rise for the coming year. The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority - the independent body which sets MPs' pay -said in October that MPs could be in line for a Â£3,000 pay riseif its usual formula was applied. But it now says such a rise would ""be inconsistent"" and ""would not reflect the reality that many constituents are facing"" because of the pandemic. More than 50 MPs had already called for the increase to be cancelled. Many reacted positively to news of the pay freeze. Labour's Catherine West tweeted that ""anything else would have been an insult to public sector workers,"" while Conservative James Cartlidge said it was ""absolutely the right thing to do"". MPs' basic salary is currently Â£81,932 a year, and is more if they serve as government ministers. Ministers' salaries have also been frozen for a year.

"German officials had hoped to relax ""partial lockdown"" conditions but are now planning to tighten them Germany is facing calls for a second lockdown before Christmas after recording 585 deaths and 29,875 new infections in one day - the highest numbers since the pandemic began. ""We have to act urgently. We have to do more than was previously planned,"" warned Economy Minister Peter Altmaier. Russia and Ukraine also reported record numbers of fatalities on Friday.

Travellers returning to the UK will have to self-isolate from Saturday due to rising infection rates, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said. Travel giant Tui said 800 people were due to depart for the islands on Friday morning, with 5,000 there already. The quarantine periodwill be shortened from 14 to 10 days from Monday. A statement from the four UK chief medical officers said the change came after a review of evidence and that self-isolation for those with coronavirus symptoms remained important. Where can you get winter sun without quarantining? Will I get my money back if I can't go on holiday? Meanwhile, the Foreign Office has yet to change its travel advice for the Canary Islands, meaning many holidaymakers may be unable to seek refunds or claim on their travel insurance policies. The new quarantine restrictions will be in place from 04:00 GMT on 12 December. Travellers to mainland Spain already have to isolate, but an exemption for the islands in October encouraged many to book a break in almost-guaranteed winter sun, travel expert Simon Calder told BBC Breakfast. The Department for Transport (DfT) said there had been a ""sharp increase"" in the number of positive coronavirus tests on the islands. It comes as an upcoming ""test-to-release"" policy will allow travellers to leave quarantine after five days - if they pay for a private coronavirus test and receive a negative result. Even a reduced 10-day quarantine period would mean some of those due to return later next week would still need to isolate over Christmas. Steve Hay, from Bournemouth, arrived in Lanzarote on Thursday evening for a seven-day break with his family. They now face cutting it short to avoid a quarantine period that could potentially run until 27 December - effectively cancelling their Christmas plans in the UK. ""How will we do our Christmas shopping?"" Mr Hay said. ""I think it's shocking and doesn't appear much thought has gone into it. ""Why is it being implemented so quick, this only gives us tomorrow to get back. ""I think it's crazy and the Canaries cannot be looked at as a whole, each island should be rated."" Ivor Langford says he faces Christmas alone without his wife after she returned home sooner than planned Ivor Langford from Worcestershire, who is currently at his holiday home in Lanzarote, told the BBC the rule change meant he now faced spending Christmas Day alone in the UK. His wife recently returned to the UK after her father caught Covid-19 in hospital, he said. ""I have been given less than a day to fly home before Saturday 04:00,"" he said. ""I'm due to fly back on 16 December but now will have to have Christmas without my wife."" HOLIDAYS:Where can I go away in the UK? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? SOCIAL LIFE:The rules when I go to the pub? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries More than 800 people are waiting to find out whether their Tui holidays to Tenerife departing on Saturday morning will be cancelled, because the Foreign Office has not yet decided whether to also advise against travel to the islands. If the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office advises against travel to the Canary Islands, Tui will cancel all holidays immediately as this change invalidates travel insurance. It also expects to cancel its entire Christmas holiday schedule, a further blow to the operator which recorded losses of  â¬3bn (Â£2.74bn) on Thursday. Tui said it would allow those booked between Friday and 17 December ""the opportunity to amend free of charge to another date or destination"". Airline Easyjet said customers wishing to transfer their flights without a fee must do so within a week. The new test-to-release programme begins on 15 December, allowing travellers arriving in England to reduce their quarantine by more than half if they pay for a Covid test after five days. They will have to opt in to the scheme on a passenger locator form,according to the government website,external. The DfT said families could decide which members opted in to suit their circumstances but that only those who took a test after five days and received a negative result could be released early. The tests, from private firms, will cost between Â£65 and Â£120. A list of approved providers has yet to be published. England has also introduced a quarantine exemption for certain categories of travellers, including people making high-value business trips, sports stars and performing arts professionals.

"German officials had hoped to relax ""partial lockdown"" conditions but are now planning to tighten them Germany is facing calls for a second lockdown before Christmas after recording 585 deaths and 29,875 new infections in one day - the highest numbers since the pandemic began. ""We have to act urgently. We have to do more than was previously planned,"" warned Economy Minister Peter Altmaier. Russia and Ukraine also reported record numbers of fatalities on Friday. However, the latest excess death statistics have cast doubt on the numbers announced in Russian updates. Germany has been under partial lockdown since early November, shutting bars, restaurants and entertainment venues, and a relaxation had been planned over Christmas. But the rise in infections has increasingly alarmed top officials, with Lothar Wieler, head of Germany's public healthy body, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), describing the situation as ""extremely fragile"". Chancellor Angela Merkel made an impassioned speech in the Bundestag (parliament) this week calling for tighter measures, saying that ""500 deaths a day is unacceptable"". On Friday, Interior Minister Horst Seehofer warned that the only chance of regaining control was an immediate lockdown. ""If we wait until Christmas, we'll have to struggle with high numbers for months,"" he told the Spiegel website. Bavaria, in the south, has already imposed tighter measures and Mrs Merkel is reportedly set to meet all 16 state leaders on Sunday. There are few joyful tidings for Germany this Christmas. The country, which so successfully brought the first wave of the pandemic under control, is struggling to contain the second. Today Germans woke up to two miserable new records. The highest daily number of infections and deaths in a 24-hour period. A so-called ""lockdown light"", which includes the closure of bars, restaurants, leisure and arts facilities but is implemented to different degrees in different parts of the country, may have flattened the curve but it's done nothing to reduce the numbers. The days when Germany's relatively low death toll was the envy of other countries are gone; it's rising fast and this week exceeded 20,000. So what's gone wrong? Scientists say that Germans are simply not doing enough to reduce their social contacts. But many also point the finger at regional leaders, who for months have dithered, bickered and resisted Angela Merkel's calls for a tougher, countrywide response to the outbreak.

Moscow and St Petersburg were worst hit. However, official data about ""excess"" deaths - those above expected levels - has called this total into question. There were nearly 50,000 more ""excess"" deaths in October 2020 than in the same month last year.

Official health figures were less than a third of that, but only count deaths listed by a post mortem examination as having coronavirus as the main cause. Trials to combine Oxford and Sputnik vaccines Sputnik V vaccine rushed out to wary Russians Russia began using its Sputnik V vaccine on doctors, teachers and social workers last weekend and claims that some countries have been resorting to ""not very pleasant"" methods to discredit it. In a boost for Sputnik's producers, UK and Russian scientists are to trial a combination of the Oxford-AstraZeneca and Sputnik V vaccines to see if protection against Covid-19 can be improved. Sputnik's backers claim it offers 95% protection against the coronavirus, but data released so far is based on interim results only. Russia previously mocked the AstraZeneca jab as a ""monkey vaccine"" - referring to its use of a modified common cold virus that infected chimpanzees, rather than one that affects humans, to elicit an immune response.

"Reynhard Sinaga (left) and Joseph McCann were both given minimum terms of 30 years Two serial rapists serving life sentences have had the minimum time they must spend in prison extended from 30 to 40 years by the Court of Appeal. Joseph McCann, 35, was jailed last year at the Old Bailey for 37 offences involving 11 women and children. Reynhard Sinaga, 37, was sentenced at Manchester Crown Court in January for 159 offences against 48 men. The judges rejected calls for whole-life jail terms, never successfully imposed in a non-homicide case. Such an order, meaning a life sentence with no minimum term, is usually reserved for certain types of murders, like those involving serial murder, child abduction or a terrorist motive. The attorney general referred McCann and Sinaga's convictions to the Court of Appeal after describing their original jail terms as ""unduly lenient"". Police now believe Sinaga committed offences against 206 men - 60 of whom remain unidentified. The failures that let Joseph McCann out of prison The sexual predator who waited outside nightclubs Serial rapist Sinaga 'abused 206 men' Five senior judges - including the Lord Chief Justice Lord Burnett and the President of the Queen's Bench Division, Dame Victoria Sharp -heard the appeal in October at the Court of Appeal in London. Their judgement,published on Friday,external, says they are ""unable to accept the submission"" that two offenders should have received a whole-life tariff. But, they add, in the ""collective experience of this court the cases of McCann and Sinaga, albeit very different on their individual facts, come within the category of the most serious cases involving a campaign of rape to have been tried in England and Wales."" The judgement then alters the minimum terms for McCann and Sinaga to 40 years each, saying the ""multiple life sentences remain and whether either is in fact ever released will depend upon the assessment of risk by the Parole Board at the end of the minimum terms"". The ruling states that ""neither man has shown any remorse and the long-term psychological damage for at least some of the victims in both trials is profound and will only be understood in the years to come"". The judgement says it endorses the line of authority that does ""not shut the door"" to a whole-life tariff in a non-murder case. Examples it gives include a ""bomb planted on a commercial airliner"" that fails to explode or intervention by the authorities that ""prevents an act of mass-murder"". The offending of McCann and Sinaga, ""does not, in our judgement, call for either to receive a whole-life tariff"", the ruling states. It adds: ""This is not to minimise the seriousness of their offending but instead to ensure that the most severe sentence in our jurisdiction is reserved, save exceptionally, either for the most serious cases involving loss of life, or when a substantive plan to murder of similar seriousness is interrupted close to fulfilment."" One 17-year-old victim says a sentence extension of 10 years ""just isn't enough"". The teenager and her 11-year-old brother were raped by McCann after he took them and their mother prisoner in their home. ""I think for me personally it's the fact that the courts don't think his crimes were serious enough for life without parole because he didn't commit murder,"" she said in a statement. ""When you're put in a position at such a young age - and not knowing whether you're going to come out of the horrific nightmare alive or dead - it has a different effect on your thoughts of everything. ""The fear of not knowing his next move or what's going to happen. It makes you think of everything differently. ""I will have to live with that fear I felt on that day for my whole life, it still haunts me. ""I was expecting him to get life, therefore I am upset and disappointed with the end decision and I think they will regret this decision in time to come."" The teenager added: ""No-one will ever understand as a victim how it feels for them knowing their offender isn't sorry for what they did, that they don't care about what they did. ""The victims don't go a day without thinking about what happened, having flash backs, nightmares and other related things."" She said McCann was not ""sorry for what he did"" and did not ""have to live the nightmare of what happened"". Girl raped by serial sex attacker 'feels failed' In a statement after the ruling, Solicitor General Michael Ellis QC said: ""Both offenders carried out some of the most heinous and depraved sexual attacks that shocked the nation. ""I am grateful for the guidance the court gave about whole-life orders and I am pleased that the court imposed a longer minimum term. ""I hope this brings some solace to the victims of these despicable crimes."" Meanwhile, Greater Manchester Police said it had identifieda further 23 people it believed were victims of Sinaga. It said it had yet to identify about 60 of the 206 victims and suspected victims. Sinaga filmed his rapes and collected so-called ""trophies"" from his drugged victims, but officers have not been able to establish the true identities of all the men. The force appealed again for anyone affected to come forward. The list of offenders with a whole-life term includes serial killers Rosemary West and Stephen Port. As of June this year there were 63 whole-life prisoners and an additional three life prisoners being treated in secure hospitals.

"Police said Craig McCulloch was ""devious"" while pretending to be generous and caring A ""devious"" church treasurer who stole more than Â£450,000 from charities has been jailed for three years. Craig McCulloch, 34, stole more than Â£130,000 from a London church, defrauded a charity of Â£287,000 and took nearly Â£38,000 from a college. Police said he ""squandered"" most of the money on fast food, eBay purchases and rental cars. McCulloch, of Littleborough in Greater Manchester, pleaded guilty to four counts of fraud by abuse of position. At Southwark Crown Court, he was also handed a five-year serious crime prevention order. McCulloch stole from both the bank account of St James Church in New Barnet, north London, and the congregation when he volunteered there between September 2013 and December 2018. He had been working in the accounting departments of south London-based young person's charity XLP and the Oasis College of Higher Education in Kennington when he stole from them, the court heard. Vicar of St James Church, Rev Laura Jane Hewitt, said the church community had shared ""the sense of shock and betrayal of trust"". ""Now that justice has been done, we hope and pray that Craig himself will seek to put his life right and find a fresh start,"" she said. Det Con Mark Baker, from the City of London Police's fraud team, said McCulloch was ""one of the most devious individuals I have ever dealt with"" and people felt ""shocked and deceived"". ""He stole charity and church donations and used them for his own personal gain. He presented an image of someone caring, involved in his local community, leading a Christian lifestyle, and being generous with his money,"" he said. He said some of the charities were left ""struggling to fund important services"". Why not follow BBC North West onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external?

of the Christmas break despite concerns among European countries about the possible spread of infections. Many resorts have delayed their opening due to the pandemic, but resorts
in Catalonia are set to open on Monday 14 November, according to AFP news agency. Special measures are in place in Spain's resorts, such asreduced
capacity on lifts and in restaurants and bars.,external Other countries such as France, Germany and Italy will keep its
resorts closed over the Christmas period. Italy, supported by Germany, wanted a European agreement to close
all ski resorts over the holiday. However, ski resorts in countries including
Spain, Switzerland and Austriaall released plans to
open. Warner Bros will release its live action Tom and Jerry both online and in cinemas The company that owns the UK's Odeon Cinemas has secured $100m (Â£76m) in emergency funds amid concerns about Covid-19 - but warned the money will only help it through another month. AMC Entertainment Holdings, the world's largest movie theatre operator, said attendance has dropped 92% in the US and 86% internationally. The pandemic has meant that some cinemas have shut and audiences have stayed away. The company is burning through $125m a month. ""Our current cash burn rates are not sustainable,"" it said. Even once cinemas reopened this year, it said the growth of streaming posed a challenge. Warner Bros this month said it planned to release all of its 2021 films online on the same day they are released to cinemas. They will air on the HBO Max streaming service, with which it shares a parent company. Disney has also said it plans to push more of its films to its Disney+ streaming service.

South Africa's top judge says he is unconcerned about criticism after a video showing him falsely suggesting that Covid-19 vaccines could alter people's DNA and insert satanic elements within them was widely shared online. Speaking to the media on Friday, Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng said he expected a backlash for the comments he made on Thursday at a prayer event. He told reporters that he was concerned about a report he saw that suggested that the Covid-19 vaccine would be mandatory. ""It must be voluntary... You can't impose a vaccine on people. Why should you?""news site EWN quotes the judge as saying.,external His opinion on Covid-19 vaccines has divided South Africans. There have been concerns that rich countries may be buying up most of the newly developed vaccines, not leaving enough for countries in Africa, although both Nigeria and Uganda have said they have ordered millions of doses. A study of coronavirus patients in intensive care has found that
some people become more susceptible to severe Covid-19 symptoms than others. Scientists looked into the DNA of more than 2,200 patients in UK
hospitals. They looked at each personâs genes, which contain the instructions
for every biological process â including how to fight a virus. Their genomes were then compared with those of healthy people to
pinpoint any genetic differences. The findings shed light on where the immune system goes wrong,
which could help identify new treatments. You can read

About 2,000 troops were deployed to Liverpool in November Army regiments that helped set up and run a mass coronavirus testing pilot in Liverpool are to be given the Freedom of the City - the city's the highest civic honour. Around 2,000 troops were deployed to Liverpool in November, where they helped carry out 200,000 tests at almost 50 centres. The city's coronavirus infection rates have since dropped from 680 cases per 100,000 people to fewer than 100. It enabled the city region to move down from tier three to tier two when the national lockdown ended.

In projections released on Friday, the agency predicts at
least 90,000 more cases by Christmas Day - but says this figure could reach 135,000. It alsoestimated that there could be between 1,300 and 1,800 deaths in the weeks leading up to by 25 December,external. More than 445,000 cases have been confirmed in Canada and 13,130

purchased 20 million doses of the vaccine - enough to inoculate 10 million
people - with the option to buy 56 million more. A new-born giraffe has been named Margaret in honour of the world's first Covid vaccine patient. Staff at Whipsnade Zoo in Bedfordshire picked the name because the female calf was born on Tuesday - thesame day Margaret Keenan, 90, received the Pfizer/BioNTech jab in Coventry. She was the first person to receive the jab outside of a clinical trial. Team leader Mark Holden said: ""The arrival of our precious giraffe calf on the same day, and actually at the same time, as the much-anticipated Covid-19 vaccination was first administered feels like a real moment of hope, and one we are so keen to celebrate and remember."" The zoo says it hopes Mrs Keenan will be able to visit her namesake one day soon. It might be found at the bottom of the globe, but New Zealand has been at the top of the movie industry in 2020. Thanks to its handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, the country is enjoying an unprecedented boom in film production, with directors seeking safe conditions, and that most elusive thing this year - a normal life. International blockbusters including James Cameron's Avatar sequels, Amazon's Lord of the Rings series and Jane Campion's The Power of the Dog - starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Kirsten Dunst - all managed complex film shoots in New Zealand this year. The country's home-grown movies have also received a boost at the box office by Kiwis supporting their industry, leading one local filmmaker to joke that they're now living in ""the Hollywood of the Pacific"". New Zealand, like so many other countries, did experience a lockdown in March, But because it managed to eliminate community transmission of the virus,apart from an incident in Auckland in August,film production could resume by summer, with Avatar one of the first projects to start up again. Read more on this story from the BBC's Emma Jones here. Pallab GhoshScience correspondent, BBC News The latest estimate of the R number for the UK is 0.9 and 1 â up very slightly on the previous week â according to the latest Office for National Statistics infection survey This means that the epidemic is still shrinking after lockdown measures, but very slowly. The survey indicates that cases continued to fall in most of England and Northern Ireland last week. But the view of the governmentâs scientific advisors is that the situation is fragile. Cases are increasing in London and the East of England â especially among secondary school age children â and previous experience indicates that a surge among older age groups will inevitably follow. The advisors believe that it will be important to keep infection levels as low as possible in the run up to the holidays. Thatâs because the relaxation of restrictions that permit families to meet over Christmas will accelerate any increase in cases â and lead to another sharp spike in infections early in the New Year.

soon as possible, they added. ""We need to dramatically reduce the amount of contact between one another, "" said Maria Rotzen Ostlund,the region's infectious diseases doctor,external. She said that distance learning would not be enough and
stressed the importance of limiting social contacts to as few people as
possible. Ostlund also recommended that employers allow their staff
to work from home where possible. Stockholm is one of the worst affected regions in the
country, accounting for a third of Sweden's confirmed Covid-related death toll, according to Reuters news agency. The Swedish government is aiming to offer the vaccine to all of thoseover the age of 18 during the first half of 2021.,external Sweden has recorded 312,728 cases and 7,354 deaths since the
pandemic began, according to Johns Hopkins University. A recommended Â£3,300 pay rise for UK MPs has been scrapped over concerns it would ""not reflect the reality"" the public is facing during the pandemic. The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority ordered a pay freeze for the next financial year. The basic salary for MPs is currently Â£79,468-a-year, and many were already promising to refuse or give away the extra money at a time when many of their constituents were struggling. Prime Minister Boris Johnson had also joined Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer in urging the IPSA not to go ahead with its plans. The rise was set in October - based on the official statistic for public sector earnings growth.  But IPSA came under more pressure to scrap it after thechancellor imposed a pay cap on millions of public sector workersbecause of the financial impact of Covid on government finances. IPSA chairman Richard Lloyd wrote to MPs saying a pay rise ""would result in a salary increase for MPs that would be inconsistent with the wider economic data and would not reflect the reality that many constituents are facing this year"".

This video can not be played The World Health Organization's regional director for Europe, Hans Kluge, has backed a warning from German Chancellor Angela Merkel that it will take some time for the new coronavirus vaccines to turn the pandemic around. Mrs Merkel told the German parliament the country would not be able to vaccinate enough of its citizens to change the course of the pandemic in the first quarter of 2021. Mr Kluge said the delayed effects of vaccination programmes highlighted the need to prioritise key workers and vulnerable groups first. He also warned of the effects of relaxing rules too much around Christmas: ""I am very concerned. Now every 17 seconds someone is dying of Covid-19, which may double if people are relaxing,"" he told BBC World News. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst People are screened at a clinic in Huanggang, in China's central Hubei province (file photo) A number of people in central China have been fined and
told to self-isolate after they bought imported pork online that could potentially
have been contaminated with Covid-19. According to the national Global Times newspaper, 24
residents in Huanggang, central Hubei province, have been fined 200 yuan
(Â£23; $30.50) for buying imported pork from Brazil via the Meituan shopping
platform. The pork should have been destroyed rather than sold because, as
the newspaper notes,batches had already tested positive for Covid-19,external. An investigation is now being carried out into the
shopping platform. One of the big concerns in China is how imported food might carry the virus, and so the country is stepping up regulation to
prevent ordinary consumers from directly getting their hands on such goods. This week, China's top court announced that e-commerce platforms
could be ""held legally responsible for food safety issues,externalrelated to products
purchased on their platforms"". China says that many of its localised Covid-19 outbreaks over the
last year have been linked to imported cold-chain goods, and there are regular
news stories about coastal regions discovering the virus on overseas goods.
Many of the first patients in cities that have experienced outbreaks have been
workers who handle such products. UK airport operator Heathrow has said it will keep Terminal 4 closed until the end of next year as the pandemic continues to affect travel. The company said passenger numbers at the airport - usually one of the busiest in the world - fell 88% in November ""as travel restrictions and a second lockdown took their toll"". Based on forecasts and current traffic, it said it would extend the closure of Terminal 4 until the end of 2021. Heathrow shut the terminal in May during the first national lockdown. It led to airlines such as Air France, Etihad and KLM moving to Terminal 2. Â© 2025 BBC.

"German officials had hoped to relax ""partial lockdown"" conditions but are now planning to tighten them Germany is facing calls for a second lockdown before Christmas after recording 585 deaths and 29,875 new infections in one day - the highest numbers since the pandemic began. ""We have to act urgently. We have to do more than was previously planned,"" warned Economy Minister Peter Altmaier. Russia and Ukraine also reported record numbers of fatalities on Friday. However, the latest excess death statistics have cast doubt on the numbers announced in Russian updates. Germany has been under partial lockdown since early November, shutting bars, restaurants and entertainment venues, and a relaxation had been planned over Christmas. But the rise in infections has increasingly alarmed top officials, with Lothar Wieler, head of Germany's public healthy body, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), describing the situation as ""extremely fragile"". Chancellor Angela Merkel made an impassioned speech in the Bundestag (parliament) this week calling for tighter measures, saying that ""500 deaths a day is unacceptable"". On Friday, Interior Minister Horst Seehofer warned that the only chance of regaining control was an immediate lockdown. ""If we wait until Christmas, we'll have to struggle with high numbers for months,"" he told the Spiegel website. Bavaria, in the south, has already imposed tighter measures and Mrs Merkel is reportedly set to meet all 16 state leaders on Sunday. There are few joyful tidings for Germany this Christmas. The country, which so successfully brought the first wave of the pandemic under control, is struggling to contain the second. Today Germans woke up to two miserable new records. The highest daily number of infections and deaths in a 24-hour period. A so-called ""lockdown light"", which includes the closure of bars, restaurants, leisure and arts facilities but is implemented to different degrees in different parts of the country, may have flattened the curve but it's done nothing to reduce the numbers. The days when Germany's relatively low death toll was the envy of other countries are gone; it's rising fast and this week exceeded 20,000. So what's gone wrong? Scientists say that Germans are simply not doing enough to reduce their social contacts. But many also point the finger at regional leaders, who for months have dithered, bickered and resisted Angela Merkel's calls for a tougher, countrywide response to the outbreak.

Sputnik's backers claim it offers 95% protection against the coronavirus, but data released so far is based on interim results only.

of the Christmas break despite concerns among European countries about the possible spread of infections. Many resorts have delayed their opening due to the pandemic, but resorts
in Catalonia are set to open on Monday 14 November, according to AFP news agency. Special measures are in place in Spain's resorts, such asreduced
capacity on lifts and in restaurants and bars.,external Other countries such as France, Germany and Italy will keep its
resorts closed over the Christmas period. Italy, supported by Germany, wanted a European agreement to close
all ski resorts over the holiday. However, ski resorts in countries including
Spain, Switzerland and Austriaall released plans to
open. Warner Bros will release its live action Tom and Jerry both online and in cinemas The company that owns the UK's Odeon Cinemas has secured $100m (Â£76m) in emergency funds amid concerns about Covid-19 - but warned the money will only help it through another month. AMC Entertainment Holdings, the world's largest movie theatre operator, said attendance has dropped 92% in the US and 86% internationally. The pandemic has meant that some cinemas have shut and audiences have stayed away. The company is burning through $125m a month. ""Our current cash burn rates are not sustainable,"" it said. Even once cinemas reopened this year, it said the growth of streaming posed a challenge. Warner Bros this month said it planned to release all of its 2021 films online on the same day they are released to cinemas. They will air on the HBO Max streaming service, with which it shares a parent company. Disney has also said it plans to push more of its films to its Disney+ streaming service.

South Africa's top judge says he is unconcerned about criticism after a video showing him falsely suggesting that Covid-19 vaccines could alter people's DNA and insert satanic elements within them was widely shared online. Speaking to the media on Friday, Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng said he expected a backlash for the comments he made on Thursday at a prayer event. He told reporters that he was concerned about a report he saw that suggested that the Covid-19 vaccine would be mandatory. ""It must be voluntary... You can't impose a vaccine on people. Why should you?""news site EWN quotes the judge as saying.,external His opinion on Covid-19 vaccines has divided South Africans. There have been concerns that rich countries may be buying up most of the newly developed vaccines, not leaving enough for countries in Africa, although both Nigeria and Uganda have said they have ordered millions of doses. A study of coronavirus patients in intensive care has found that
some people become more susceptible to severe Covid-19 symptoms than others. Scientists looked into the DNA of more than 2,200 patients in UK
hospitals. They looked at each personâs genes, which contain the instructions
for every biological process â including how to fight a virus. Their genomes were then compared with those of healthy people to
pinpoint any genetic differences. The findings shed light on where the immune system goes wrong,
which could help identify new treatments. You can read

About 2,000 troops were deployed to Liverpool in November Army regiments that helped set up and run a mass coronavirus testing pilot in Liverpool are to be given the Freedom of the City - the city's the highest civic honour. Around 2,000 troops were deployed to Liverpool in November, where they helped carry out 200,000 tests at almost 50 centres. The city's coronavirus infection rates have since dropped from 680 cases per 100,000 people to fewer than 100. It enabled the city region to move down from tier three to tier two when the national lockdown ended.

She was the first person to receive the jab outside of a clinical trial.

The zoo says it hopes Mrs Keenan will be able to visit her namesake one day soon. It might be found at the bottom of the globe, but New Zealand has been at the top of the movie industry in 2020. Thanks to its handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, the country is enjoying an unprecedented boom in film production, with directors seeking safe conditions, and that most elusive thing this year - a normal life. International blockbusters including James Cameron's Avatar sequels, Amazon's Lord of the Rings series and Jane Campion's The Power of the Dog - starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Kirsten Dunst - all managed complex film shoots in New Zealand this year. The country's home-grown movies have also received a boost at the box office by Kiwis supporting their industry, leading one local filmmaker to joke that they're now living in ""the Hollywood of the Pacific"". New Zealand, like so many other countries, did experience a lockdown in March, But because it managed to eliminate community transmission of the virus,apart from an incident in Auckland in August,film production could resume by summer, with Avatar one of the first projects to start up again. Read more on this story from the BBC's Emma Jones here. Pallab GhoshScience correspondent, BBC News The latest estimate of the R number for the UK is 0.9 and 1 â up very slightly on the previous week â according to the latest Office for National Statistics infection survey This means that the epidemic is still shrinking after lockdown measures, but very slowly. The survey indicates that cases continued to fall in most of England and Northern Ireland last week. But the view of the governmentâs scientific advisors is that the situation is fragile. Cases are increasing in London and the East of England â especially among secondary school age children â and previous experience indicates that a surge among older age groups will inevitably follow. The advisors believe that it will be important to keep infection levels as low as possible in the run up to the holidays. Thatâs because the relaxation of restrictions that permit families to meet over Christmas will accelerate any increase in cases â and lead to another sharp spike in infections early in the New Year.

"Jimmy Lai was originally detained under the national security law in August Hong Kong pro-democracy media tycoon Jimmy Lai has been charged under the territory's controversial new national security law. Mr Lai, 73, is accused of conspiring with foreign forces to endanger national security, and could face a lengthy jail term. He is the most high-profile person charged under the new law. Mr Lai founded the Apple Daily newspaper and is a fierce critic of the Beijing authorities. Beijing has said the new security law will return stability to the territory after a year of unrest, but critics say it has silenced dissent. China's new law: Why is Hong Kong worried? Hong Kong's rebel mogul and pro-democracy voice The Hong Kong paper that pushed the boundary Mr Lai was originally arrested under the law in Augustafter a police raid on Apple Daily's head office, but was released on bail. However, he has been in custody since 2 December,after being denied bail on a separate charge of fraudrelated to the lease of a building that houses the newspaper. He will appear in court on Saturday. Mr Lai also holds UK citizenship and a spokesman for PM Boris Johnson said on Friday that the UK remained ""deeply concerned about the Hong Kong authorities' focus on pursuing legal cases against pro-democracy figures like Jimmy Lai"". Mr Lai was seen in handcuffs after his arrest on 2 December Meanwhile US-based news networkBloomberg reported that its Beijing-based staff member Haze Fan was being held by the Chinese authorities,externalon suspicion of endangering national security. Ms Fan, a Chinese citizen, had been missing since Monday when she was seen being escorted from her apartment by plain-clothes security officials. Her detention was confirmed on Thursday. A Bloomberg spokesperson said they were ""very concerned for her"". In a separate case in Hong Kong earlier, teenage activist Tony Chung was convicted of desecrating the Chinese flag and unlawful assembly. He could now be facing up to five years in prison. Hong Kong migrants to UK 'will need support' Chung, the leader of a now disbanded pro-democracy group, is also the first public political figure to be prosecuted under the national security law. He faces a charge of secession, which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. China has accelerated its crackdown on Hong Kong's opposition since the law was imposed in June, with legislators disqualified and dozens of activists charged or investigated. Three prominent activists including Joshua Wong were jailed earlier this monthfor their part in pro-democracy protests in 2019. One of the city's most prominent supporters of the pro-democracy movement, Mr Lai is estimated to be worth more than $1bn (Â£766m).  Having made his initial fortune in the clothing industry, he later ventured into media and founded Next Digital. Next Digital publishes Apple Daily, a well-read tabloid which is frequently critical of Hong Kong and mainland Chinese leadership. In a local media landscape increasingly fearful of Beijing, Mr Lai is a persistent thorn for China - both through his publications and writing. This video can not be played Jimmy Lai told the BBC he would not give in to intimidation It has seen him become a hero for many residents in Hong Kong but on the mainland he is viewed as a traitor who threatens Chinese national security. Interviewed by the BBC before his arrest earlier in December, he said he would not give in to intimidation. ""If they can induce fear in you, that's the cheapest way to control you and the most effective way and they know it. The only way to defeat the way of intimidation is to face up to fear and don't let it frighten you."" A former British colony, Hong Kong was handed back to China in 1997 but under the ""one country, two systems"" principle. It was supposed to guarantee certain freedoms for the territory - including freedom of assembly and speech, an independent judiciary and some democratic rights - which mainland China does not have. But the National Security Law has reduced Hong Kong's autonomy and made it easier to punish demonstrators. The legislation introduced new crimes, including penalties of up to life in prison. Anyone found to have conspired with foreigners to provoke ""hatred"" of the Chinese government or the Hong Kong authorities may have committed a crime. This video can not be played Hong Kong security law: The BBC's Stephen McDonell explains what it means, and what people there think Trials can be held in secret and without a jury, and cases can be taken over by the mainland authorities. Mainland security personnel can legally operate in Hong Kong with impunity. After the law was introduced, a number of pro-democracy groups disbanded out of fears for their safety. The Chinese government defends the law, saying it will help return stability to the territory, which has been shaken by pro-democracy protests, and bring it more into line with the Chinese mainland.

"The fire broke out in the three-storey house in St Neots on Thursday morning A three-year-old boy and seven-year-old girl have died in a fire at a house. The children died at the scene of the blaze in St Neots, Cambridgeshire, on Thursday morning, police said. Their 35-year-old mother suffered life-changing injuries from jumping from a second-floor window, while her partner, a 46-year-old man, had minor injuries. Firefighters described how they were told the children were still in the burning house when they arrived and they tried to get them out. An investigation into the fire has concluded the most probable cause was an electrical fault in a first-floor bedroom. There were no suspicious circumstances, Cambridgeshire Police said. Smoke was seen billowing from the house on Thursday About 40 firefighters were sent to tackle the blaze, at the home in Buttercup Avenue, Eynesbury. Floral tributes and soft toys have been left under a tree near the house. A message on a teddy bear said: ""We have no words. So heartbroken. Hope you are all in a better place. XXX."" One card reads: ""Dear darling angels, keep holding each other's hands. You are so loved."" Police, the ambulance service and an air ambulance were also sent to the scene Neighbour Charles Cooper, 30, said: ""The flames went up fairly swiftly. By the time my wife and I woke up, the firefighters had already arrived. ""It took a good three or four hours before the smoke abated. The flames were coming out of the top window."" He said he did not know the family to speak to but said ""we would give them a wave"".

"All pupils, their families and teachers in parts of London, Kent and Essex should take a Covid test, Matt Hancock has said, as he set out a mass testing scheme for secondary schools. Extra mobile testing units will be sent out after east London and parts of Kent and Essex became some of England's major coronavirus hotspots. Cases in these areas have risen fast, especially among 11 to 18-year-olds. One London head teacher said the extra tests had been ""a long time coming"". Ges Smith, head teacher at Jo Richardson Community School in Dagenham, said he would ""strongly encourage"" his pupils to get tested but added: ""As far as I know we have got no mandate on forcing students to take that test."" Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""I urge every student, parent and teacher in these areas to step forward for testing - irrespective of whether they have symptoms. While Covid-19 may be lower risk to children and young people, it still poses a significant risk to their families and communities."" He said he wanted to keep schools and colleges open but needed to target rising infection rates. Covid tests at university find few positive cases Will there be mass testing at your child's school? London's coronavirus levels rising, ONS says Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said many parts of the country had higher infection rates than the places where the secondary school mass testing scheme was being rolled out. The government should commit to a rolling out mass testing for schools across the country, including to primary schools in areas where rates for those age groups were high. A teacher from the Midlands, who asked to remain anonymous, said he was upset at the focus on London and the south east. ""It shows clear preferential treatment when London schools get offered mass testing, yet the Midlands and the North, which have been under massive pressure for months, have never been offered this mass testing,"" he told the BBC. ""Will they (the government) now roll out mass testing to other hard-hit areas in the North and Midlands?"" He said his school had ""been under massive pressure"" since reopening, ""with close to 100 positive cases of both children and staff"". The government said all local authorities in England's top tier three of Covid restrictions had been invited to apply for a six-week community testing programme followinga mass testing trial in Liverpool. Mass testing aims to find people who might be infected but not yet displaying symptoms so they can be told to isolate. Mass Covid testing is going to become an ever bigger part of the attempt to keep schools open - and expect to see much more of it in the new year, for staff and pupils. But this latest intervention seems to be more about targeting young people in this secondary school age group, in these hotspot areas, rather than entire school year groups being screened. It's community testing with a focus on the rising infection rates among young people, rather than head teachers organising mass testing in schools. There will be 15 mobile testing units ""in or near schools"" in London, but it seems so far unlikely to be schools testing pupils in the way universities carried out mass testing of students. This will also raise questions. If there are such concerns about this age group, why not send pupils home to study online for the last few days of term -as has happened in Wales? There have been consistent warnings aboutCovid hitting attendance in schools- so why is this testing appearing now when the term is almost over? And schools in northern England, struggling for months with high levels of infections, will be irritated at the sudden urgency of efforts to prevent London moving up to tier three restrictions. There is also politics behind this. Aftera summer of U-turns, the government will do everything it can to keep schools open in England. The areas receiving extra tests for secondary schools include: The seven worst-affected London boroughs, which are Barking and Dagenham, Hackney, Havering, Newham, Redbridge, Tower Hamlets and Waltham Forest The City of London The Essex areas of Southend, Basildon, Canvey Island, Harlow and Brentwood The Kent areas of Swale, Thanet and Maidstone Mr Hancock said both PCR (a standard coronavirus test) and lateral flow testing - which takes about half an hour to show a result - would be used. In a joint statement, the Department for Education and Department of Health said an extra 15 mobile testing units would be sent out in or near schools in the capital for staff, students and their families to be tested, providing about 75,000 tests. And 44,000 home test kits will be made available for school staff to be tested before term begins in January. Covid tests for secondaries in 'concerning' areas Rising numbers of pupils sent home in England Rapid coronavirus test use defended In Essex, 10 mobile testing units will be deployed tomorrow and over the weekend, while Kent will have a further 12 mobile testing units by the start of next week. Four of the affected London boroughs were among the 20 places with the highest case rates in last week, according to Public Health England. These were Havering (400.7 cases per 100,000 people), Barking and Dagenham (333.5), Waltham Forest (327.1) and Redbridge (310.3). Some 21 of London's 32 boroughs have infection rates higher than overall rate for England of 150 cases per 100,000 people. Taken together, London's outer boroughs have an infection rate of 205 cases per 100,000. That is higher than the rate in Leicestershire, Tees Valley or Bristol, which are all under tier-three rules - the highest level - meaning people can only meet other households in outdoor public spaces such as parks, where the rule of six applies. What are the latest tiers and lockdown rules? SCHOOLS:What happens if pupils catch coronavirus? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? TEACHERS:Are they are at risk? Kent is in tier three but London and Essex are currently in tier two - meaning no household mixing is allowed indoors and the rule of six applies outdoors. Mr Hancock urged Londonersto ""stick by the rules"" this week amid fears the capital might be moved into tier threewhen the tiers are reviewed next week. About 99% of England's population are living in areas in the strictest two tiers of coronavirus rules, including more than 32 million in tier-two areas and more than 23 million in tier three. Schools in England have been given permission to close a day early for the Christmas holidaysto reduce the chances of teachers having to spend their time off speaking to contact tracersabout potential Covid cases. Meanwhile, more than 50 schools in Belfast have written to Northern Ireland's education ministerurging him to reconsider his decision not to close schools early in the run-up to Christmas. The Scottish government considered extending the Christmas school holidaysto limit the spread of the virus after families get together during the festive period - but decided against it last week. In Wales,all secondary schools and many primary schools will move classes onlinefrom Monday. Some teachers have criticised the move,saying they have had insufficient time to make arrangements.

"With time running out for the UK and EU to reach a trade agreement - and with the prospect of no deal looming - the government has been talking about an ""Australian-style"" relationship with the EU in the future. Boris Johnson has frequently mentioned Australia, and has also said the UK should ""get ready to trade on WTO terms"". Whichever form of words you use, they are euphemisms for the same thing: a no-deal outcome. Australia trades with the EU under the basic rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO) because it does not currently have a free trade agreement with the EU. But it is trying to negotiate one. ""Australians wouldn't regard our trade relationship with Europe as a satisfactory one,"" the former Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull told the BBC. He warned the UK to""be careful what you wish for"". Under WTO rules, tariffs (or taxes) are automatically applied to the trade in goods between Australia and the EU. But even though there is no overall free trade deal, the two sides do have a series of agreements on things like wine exports and product standards, which make trade a little easier. If the UK's talks with the EU were to break down abruptly, the UK would not have any such agreements. With no deal, in other words, the UK would be facing an even more limited trading relationship with the EU than Australia has (the strictest limits would be on trade involving Great Britain - Northern Ireland would be treated differently). On top of that, it is important to remember that trade between Australia and the EU is very different to trade between the UK and the EU. Australia is on the other side of the world, whereas the UK is the EU's next-door neighbour. That means Australia doesn't do nearly as much trade with the EU as the UK does. And it doesn't rely on the EU, in the way the UK does, for the operation of just-in-time supply chains in sectors such as cars, pharmaceuticals and food. So, border checks and delays - which happen much more when you don't have trade deals - have far less impact on EU-Australia trade than they would on EU-UK trade. Even so, Australia is trying to upgrade its relationship with the EU - the two sides have been negotiating a free trade deal since 2018. Mr Turnbull told BBC Question Time, ""Australians would not regard our trade relationship with Europe as being a satisfactory one...there are very big barriers to Australian exports of agriculture products in particular and a lot of friction in the system in terms of services."" The EU is the UK's biggest single trading partner.In 2019, it accounted for:,external 43% of UK exports 51% of UK imports As an EU member state, the UK was part of its trading system - the customs union and the single market. This means there are no tariffs on goods, and minimal border checks. Because of the post-Brexit transition period, the UK is still in this system until the end of December. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Both sides have until then to reach a new free-trade agreement, which would get rid of tariffs and quotas (limits on the number of goods traded) but not new border bureaucracy. If they can't, then they'd have to trade on WTO rules - as Australia does. The WTO is the place where countries negotiate the rules of international trade - there are 164 members and if they don't have free-trade agreements with each other, they trade under basic ""WTO rules"". The WTO headquarters are in Geneva Every member has a list of tariffs and quotas that they apply to other countries with which they don't have a deal. These are known as WTO schedules. Yes, examples include the United States, China and Brazil. In fact, it's any country with which the EU has not signed a free-trade deal. That's when WTO rules kick in. But, like Australia, those big economies don't just rely on basic WTO rules - they have all done other deals with the EU to help facilitate trade. The US, for example, has at least 20 agreements with the EU that help regulate specific sectors, covering everything from wine and bananas to insurance and energy-efficiency labelling. The government has said repeatedly that it wants a free-trade deal along the lines of the one the EU has with Canada. What is a 'Canada-style' trade deal? But the UK and the EU have been trying to negotiate an agreement that would have no tariffs or quotas at all. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics Whereas the EU's deal with Canada does include tariffs and quotas (on some agricultural produce for example) and it had to be negotiated line by line over a long period of time. What happens if there's no trade deal? Under WTO rules, tariffs would be imposed on all imported goods, apart from in Northern Ireland, which is subject to a separate agreement with the EU. The average EU tariff is pretty low (about 2.8% for non-agricultural products) but in some sectors tariffs can be quite high. Cars coming from manufacturers in the UK would be taxed at 10%, with some agricultural tariffs even higher - rising to an average of more than 35% for dairy products. This would have a big impact on some UK businesses selling their goods to the EU. The UK would do the same, and impose its tariffs on imported EU goods which would have a big impact on some European companies. The government has alreadyreleased details,externalof the tariffs it will charge from January 2021 to countries with which there is no free trade deal. In some areas, they will be imposed to protect British producers - in the car sector, for example, and on most agricultural products, to avoid ""additional disruption for UK farmers and consumers"". That will lead to higher prices in the UK for some EU goods. But the government is also removing some of the tariffs it has been charging as part of the EU - in areas, for example, where there isn't that much domestic UK production that needs protecting. Here are some items that are having their tariffs cut to zero. It's important to remember that the WTO's ""most favoured nation"" rules limit room for manoeuvre in the event of no deal. The UK couldn't for example lower tariffs for the EU alone, in order to keep trade going. It would have to treat the rest of the world in the same way, which could lead to cheap imports flooding the UK economy, and harming domestic businesses. It's not just about tariffs - there are also what are called ""non-tariff barriers"". In many areas of the economy they are far more important. Non-tariff barriers include things like product standards, safety regulations and sanitary checks on food and animals. Many of them will apply with or without a deal, but businesses that trade with Europe fear that no deal in particular would lead to lengthy delays and extra costs. Eventually negotiations on some kind of deal would have to begin again, but that could take some time. All of this refers only to the trade in goods. The trade in services between the UK and the EU is also of critical importance. The kind of trade deal the two sides have been trying to negotiate wouldn't say very much about services anyway. But no deal would be an even greater challenge. And companies on both sides would be having to adjust to an abrupt change at the same time as trying to deal with the impact of coronavirus.

"After months of negotiations, the UK and European Union finally agreed a deal that will define their future relationship, which comes into effect at 23.00GMT on 31 December. It has. The UK voted to leave the EU in 2016 and officially left the trading bloc - its nearest and biggest trading partner - on 31 January 2020. However, both sides agreed to keep many things the same until 31 December 2020, to allow enough time to agree to the terms of a new trade deal. It was a complex, sometimes bitter negotiation, but they finally agreed a deal on 24 December. The deal contains new rules for how the UK and EU will live, work and trade together. While the UK was in the EU, companies could buy and sell goods across EU borders without paying taxes and there were no limits on the amount of things which could be traded. Under the terms of the deal, that won't change on 1 January, but to be sure that neither side has an unfair advantage, both sides had to agree to some shared rules and standards on workers' rights, as well as many social and environmental regulations. You can read more detail on other aspects of the deal, including more on travel, fishing, and financial services,here. What's in the Brexit deal? Freedom to work and live between the UK and the EU also comes to an end, and in 2021, UK nationals will need a visa if they want to stay in the EU more than 90 days in a 180-day period. Northern Ireland will continue to follow many of the EU's rules in order to avoid a hardening of its border with the Republic of Ireland. This will mean however that new checks will be introduced on goods entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. Now that it's no longer in the EU, the UK is free to set its own trade policy and can negotiate deals with other countries. Talks are being held with the US, Australia and New Zealand - countries that currently don't have free trade deals with the EU. UK leader Boris Johnson signed the deal after the document was flown to the UK from Brussels in an RAF plane There may not be new taxes to pay at the border, but there will be new paperwork, and the potential for it to cause delays is a serious concern. ""This is the biggest imposition of red tape that businesses have had to deal with in 50 years,"" according to William Bain from the British Retail Consortium. The UK says it will delay making most checks for six months, to allow people to get used to the new system, but the EU will be checking paperwork and carrying out checks from day one. So if businesses are not prepared, or do not fill in the new paperwork correctly, it could cause delays and backlogs at ports like Dover. The government has known about this for years, and has made plans to divert trade to other ports around the country and has built lorry parks in Kent, to avoid gridlock on the roads. It's difficult to predict what the scale of any disruption might be, but government minister Michael Gove has said that UK businesses should prepare for some ""bumpy moments"". Sadly, no. Decisions are still to be made on data sharing and on financial services, and the agreement on fishing only lasts five years. Also while the UK and EU have agreed to some identical rules now, they don't have to be identical in the future, and if one side takes exception to the changes, they can trigger a dispute, which could ultimately lead to tariffs (charges on imports) being imposed on some goods in the future. Expect the threat of disputes to be a new constant in UK-EU relations. The last few years have seen many words and phrases enter our lives. We haven't used them here, but politicians do use them. Here's what some of them mean: Transition period:The 11-month period following the UK's exit from the EU (finishing at the end of 2020), during which time the UK has followed EU rules, to allow leaders to make a deal. Free trade:Trade between two countries, where neither side charges taxes or duties on goods crossing borders. Level playing field:A set of rules to ensure that one country, or group of countries, doesn't have an unfair advantage over another. This can involve areas such as workers' rights and environmental standards. Free trade agreements like the Brexit deal often include level playing field measures. Tariff:A tax or duty to be paid on goods crossing borders.

"There were tense votes in a packed Commons last year - but there may be more to come, in a socially distanced way... Before we even begin, let's be clear - the UK has left the EU. Brexit officially happened on 31 January 2020 and the paperwork has been signed. The ink is fully dried on Britain's exit, and now the detail of its future relationship with its biggest trading partner has been set out in a 1,200 page document. What happens next with Brexit? Brexit: Will the borders be ready? Brexit: Seven things that will change on 1 January An agreement was reached on Christmas Eve, and now the deal - or elements of it - needs to be signed off by the UK Parliament, with MPs and peers to be recalled on Wednesday. But after years of division between and within political parties, how are our politicians gearing up for Wednesday's votes in the Commons? Tell us your campaign slogan again Mr Johnson? Let's start with the Conservatives, who instigated the referendum on whether to Remain or Leave back in 2016. Boris Johnsonnegotiated a post-Brexit trade dealwith the EU, ending months of disagreements over fishing rights and future business rules. In 2019, he secured a withdrawal agreement (a bit like signing the divorce papers) and called a general election. His big election win last December resulted in a secure mandate from the British public to ""Get Brexit Done"" - and get it through Parliament. With a stonking 78-strong majority (in other words, having 78 more Tory MPs than all the other parties combined) the government is expected to win tomorrow's vote. So getting his MPs to vote for the trade deal will be a walk in the park, right? Well, it may be more of a taxing jog. Only recently,the PM faced a rebellion from 55 of his MPsabout the latest coronavirus restrictions for England - and many of them came from the Eurosceptic wing of the party, who have held Mr Johnson to task over the negotiations. As the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg has said, that was perhaps an ""opportune moment"" to remind Downing Street they won't suck up any old deal. ""The devil will be in the detail,"" Brexiteer Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen said, in response to the news a deal has been agreed on Christmas Eve. And so his colleagues in the European Research Group - a group of Conservative backbench MPs who back Brexit - have instructed lawyers to pore over the 1,246 pages of legal text to make sure the deal fits their expectations. They're expected to reveal their judgment later on Tuesday. The Remain rebels of last year, such as Ken Clarke, have mostly left the Conservative benches, but those still in place have pre-emptively shown their support for a deal. Former minister Greg Clark appealed in the Commons for all efforts to be made by Mr Johnson to get an agreement, saying it would be a ""huge relief and a huge boost to confidence"" for businesses across Britain. The fact is many of Mr Johnson's new MPs are fully signed up to the Brexit cause that got them elected and many of the Remain-backing rebels have, since January, accepted the change. As a result, it is likely the majority of the party will fall in line with the boss and get behind the package when it is brought to the House. But it won't remove all tensions from a party that still has some differing opinions on its future relationship with the EU. Jeremy Corbyn with his soon-to-be successor Sir Keir Starmer in the general election campaign in 2019 Sir Keir Starmer confirmed his party's position on the new post-Brexit trade deal in a short press conference on Christmas Eve, saying: ""When this deal comes before Parliament, Labour will accept it and vote for it."" But rewind just over 12 months ago, and Labour was campaigning in a general election with Jeremy Corbyn at the forefront, promising to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement and toput their own Brexit plan to a fresh public vote. Instead of getting the keys to No 10, Labour received the worst election result since 1935. While it is fair to say Labour was a Remain-leaning party, there was a band of Leave backers in its ranks, and most MPs from both camps now say they accept Brexit and want to move on. Starmer faces revolt over backing for Brexit deal That includes the party's new leader, who had repeatedly said he wanted the UK to sign a trade deal with the EU. After the deal was announced, Sir Keir confirmed his party will support it, but he said it is a ""thin agreement"", and is ""not the deal the government promised - far from it"". He also criticised the government for ""leaving everything to the last minute"". ""At a moment of such national significance, it is not credible for Labour to be on the sidelines,"" he said. ""But let me be absolutely clear - and say directly to the government - up against no deal, we accept this deal, but the consequences of it are yours and yours alone. ""We will hold you to account for it."" But Sir Keir looks to be facing a rebellion of his own after a number of his backbenchersissued a joint statement,externalcalling on Labour ""not to support the Tories' Brexit deal"" which they say ""is a substantial downgrade of the UK's relationship with the EU"". Signatories include trade unionists and campaigners, former shadow chancellor John McDonnell, former culture secretary Ben Bradshaw and former shadow business secretary Clive Lewis. Analysis of the 2019 election result shows time and time again that the party's stance on Brexit lost Labour some of its traditional seats in the so-calledRed Wall, so voting against may not play well in the party's former heartlands. Another subtle campaign message from 2019 - this time from Nicola Sturgeon The SNP has always stood firmly and loudly against Brexit. Listen to almost any of the party's MPs question Boris Johnson at PMQs and the opposition is clear. And the party used the announcement of a deal to again reiterate its goal for an independent Scotland. Nicola Sturgeon said Brexit was happening ""against Scotland's will"" and that no deal could make up for what ""Brexit takes away from us"". So SNP MPs will vote against Boris Johnson's deal when it comes before the Commons. The party's Westminster leader Ian Blackford branded the trade agreement ""a very bad deal for Scotland"". ""[It] will terminate our membership of the EU, rip us out of the world's largest single market and customs union, end our freedom of movement rights, and impose mountains of red tape, added costs and barriers to trade for Scottish businesses,"" he said. Remember,Scotland voted overwhelmingly to Remain in the referendumand they say this gives them a mandate to reject Brexit in its entirety. And with elections for the Scottish Parliament set for May 2021, they argue that an independent Scotland would allow them to rejoin the EU on their own terms. This video can not be played Ms Swinson made her policy clear on the BBC's Andrew Marr show... The Lib Dems were not just the party of Remain in 2019 - they were the party of Revoke. They went into battle promising to cancel Brexit altogether if they secured the majority they hoped for in December. But party leader Jo Swinsonlost her own seat, and the party's total number of MPs fell to just 11. There was a backlash to her strategy, with Lib Dem post-match analysis saying many saw the Revoke plan as ""undemocratic"". The party's new leader, former energy secretary Sir Ed Davey, has refrained from attacking his predecessor's plan too harshly - as he did stand by her throughout the election campaign. While he has called for the ""closest possible relationship"" with the EU, he has ruled out calling for the UK to rejoin the bloc in the near future. But now there is a deal on the table, Sir Ed has branded it ""last minute and threadbare"". He said it ""puts up barriers to trade, barriers to business, making it harder and more expensive for British firms to export"". So he and his colleagues will not support it. Powerful vibes from the DUP walking down Whitehall in 2019 The DUP, and their Northern Ireland colleagues in the Alliance and SDLP parties have all indicated that they will not support the plan. They do have the added pressure of representing the part of the UK which has the only land border with the EU post-Brexit. They may be a small bunch - though not much smaller than the Lib Dems - but the Democratic Unionist Party played a big role in Brexit days gone by. The DUP held the balance of power during Theresa May's tenure, after a less-than-perfect win for the Tories at the 2017 election meant they relied on their friends' support (and ensured it with a cool Â£1bn deal) in a hung Parliament. But while the so-called confidence and supply agreement saw them support Theresa May's government,the DUP believe in Brexitand weren't going to vote for a deal they didn't believe in. Exit May and enter Johnson. The new PM worked hard to get them on side in the early months of his premiership. But once that aforementioned stonking election result came in last December, he no longer relied on the DUP's precious 10 votes to get his deal passed, and they dropped down the billing on the Brexit stage. DUP leader and Northern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster said: ""A sensible trade deal between the United Kingdom and the European Union was always the most favourable outcome for Northern Ireland."" The Stormont Executive met virtually on Monday to discuss the deal in detail for the first time. The DUP's Brexit spokesperson, Sammy Wilson, told the BBC as the agreement did not address ""many issues that are damaging to Northern Ireland"", his party's eight MPs would vote against it. The party has not favoured the so-called Northern Ireland Protocol, signed up to in the withdrawal agreement, which essentially sees the area remain in the EU single market for goods, while the rest of the UK leaves. In the Commons, the PM may not be concerning himself about their support any more, but if you recall, the DUP strongly allied themselves with Eurosceptics in the Tory party, who in turn backed their staunch position on being a valued member of the union. There are a few other parties represented in the Commons in smaller numbers, such as the Greens, and Wales' Plaid Cymru. If it were to come down to a small number of votes, the strong Remain stance of all these parties could have a part to play. But it's pretty clear the deal will pass. For now, we have to wait for the final outcome of Wednesday's vote to see which of our politicians will be backing or balking at the UK-EU trade deal. SIMPLE GUIDE: What happens next with Brexit?

"The UK and European Union have reached a deal on their future relationship. Here are some of your questions about how it could affect the way we live and work. Your passports will be valid as long as they are less than 10 years old and it is at least six months before they run out. However, you could face other travel restrictions. From 1 January, the UK will no longer be treated as part of the EU andBritish travellers may not be able to visit member countries except for essential reasons. That's because of coronavirus restrictions placed on travellers from most non-EU countries, although they may have changed by February. If you can get in, there may also beother documents you need, if you are planning on driving, for example. There are other coronavirus restrictions. Currently, passengers arriving into the UK from the Canary Islands must quarantine for 14 days. However, those arriving in England will be able topay for private testingand reduce their quarantine time, if they test negative five days after their arrival. What's in the Brexit deal? Britons could be barred from EU entry on 1 January How Brexit will change your holidays in 2021 Under the rules of the deal, UK citizens will only be able to holiday in Spain or most other EU countries for a maximum of 90 days in any 180-day period. The exceptions are Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania, which will not limit visits in this way. If you want to stay in Spain for longer than 90 days out of 180 then you will need to apply for a visa - that also applies to second home owners. However, due to concerns over the new variant of coronavirus,Spain has shut its bordersto UK travellers until 5 January, unless they are a Spanish national or resident. The UK will not be a member of the EU's law enforcement agency, Europol, which helps member states and others co-operate to combat terrorism, cybercrime and other serious crime. The UK will have a presence at Europol headquarters like the US does, but it will not have a say in the agency's priorities. The UK is still part of an ambitious plan to link DNA and fingerprint systems, but it will have to unplug its connection to an enormous real-time database that shares alerts on wanted or missing people and it will have limited access to the EU's database on air travellers. There have been warningsthat having to send requests for database information instead of having direct access will lead to delays. Pet passports issued in Great Britain (though not Northern Ireland) will not be valid for travel to the EU from 1 January 2021. Instead, the EU has agreed that pets arriving from Great Britain will need to have an animal health certificate (AHC). AHCs will be issued by certified vets. They will be valid for four months and must be obtained at least 10 days before travel. They will be valid for a single trip into the EU, onward travel within the EU and re-entry to Great Britain. To get an AHC,external, your dog, cat or ferret must have been microchipped, had a rabies vaccination, and been treated against echinococcus multilicaris (a type of tapeworm). Pets travelling from Great Britain will need to have an AHC to enter Northern Ireland. However, pets travelling from Northern Ireland will still be able to use the EU pet passport to travel to the EU or Great Britain. The trade deal concentrates mainly on the sale of goods, and it does not do much to help UK financial services companies access EU markets. Businesses will not have the automatic right to offer their services across the EU, as they did when the UK was a member state. Instead, they will have to rely on decisions that their regulations have ""equivalence"" with (are as good as) those in EU member states. Equivalence decisions may be withdrawn with 30 days notice and they exclude some core banking services. The EU has also said that equivalence decisions will not be made before January. Prime Minister Boris Johnson told the Sunday Telegraph that the Brexit deal ""perhaps does not go as far as we would like"" for financial services. The government says in the next few months, the UK and the EU will try to agree more details on how the relationship will work. The trade body for financial services, UK Finance,welcomed the deal,externalsaying it ""brings much-needed certainty for businesses"", but added that ""it will be important to build on the foundations of this trade deal by strengthening arrangements for future trade in financial services"". The EHIC entitles EU nationals to state-provided medical treatment if they fall ill or have an accident in any member country, as well as in Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. The government says that all EHIC cards will remain valid until their expiry date, which is printed on the card. After that, the UK will issue a new card called the UK Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC), but there are no details yet on how it will work or how to obtain it. Like EHIC, the new card will cover chronic or existing illnesses and routine maternity care, as well as emergencies. The Brexit agreement says any specialised treatment, such as dialysis or cancer treatment, ""must be subject to a prior agreement between the insured person and the unit providing the treatment"" to ensure the treatment is available. The government's advice,external, however, still says you should buy travel insurance with healthcare cover before you go on holiday. What will happen to EU health insurance cards?

"The UK has been in a transition period with the EU since last January, during which rules and trade have stayed the same. But all of this will come to an end on 1 January 2021. With just a few weeks left for the UK and the EU to negotiate a trade agreement, both sides are now talking about the prospect of a no-deal outcome. If there's no trade agreement in place, they will have to adjust quickly to doing things very differently. So how are both sides preparing? For the first six months from 1 January, the British government will bring in only minimal checks on goods coming in to the UK, but the EU will have full border checks on goods coming into the EU from the UK straight away. The UK government haswarned thata reasonable worst-case scenario could see queues of 7,000 trucks clogging up the roads around Dover and the Channel Tunnel. The UK government has two contingency plans for this: Operation Brock and Operation Fennel. Operation Brock is a traffic management plan, which it is hoped will prevent more than 10,000 lorries a day from clogging up roads in Kent. Under the scheme, drivers of very large lorries will need to get a special permit - a Kent Access Permit - before they enter the county, and permits will only be issued if they have completed the correct paperwork for exporting goods. Other traffic will be kept flowing around them, in what is known as a contraflow system. Highways England istrialling the moveable road barrier,external, which makes the contraflow system possible, on the M20 over four nights from 11 December. If there are more than 2,000 lorries queued up, the government has made plans for several temporary lorry parks - it bought a 27-acre site in Ashford in Kent. There is also a plan called Operation Fennel in which as many as 7,000 heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) could be diverted to the disused Manston airfield, near Ramsgate. This is part of the government's plans for building facilities away from ports. If further capacity is needed, a ""last resort"" would be to turn the 10-mile M26 motorway into a temporary lorry park. The UK government has also set up the Border Operations Centre to co-ordinate the response to any further disruption. Queuing at ports is not the only problem for lorry drivers. If no further steps are taken, UK lorry drivers would need to apply for documents called ECMT permits to be allowed to enter EU countries.The European Commission has warned that,externalthere are not enough of these permits available, which would mean not enough UK lorries being able to travel to the EU to pick up goods to bring back to the UK. The European Commission said this could result in serious disruptions, ""potentially even threatening public order"". To prevent this, it proposed allowing UK lorries and buses into the EU for six months without special permits, as long as EU drivers are also allowed into the UK. The proposals would also allow regular bus services that pick up and drop off passengers on either side of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland to continue to do so. The UK has not been clear yet on whether it plans to continue to allow EU operators to enter the country. A similar proposal is on the table for aviation. In the event of no deal, the UK would no longer be a member of the European Common Aviation Area, which allows British airlines to fly to destinations in the EU, and vice versa. The European Commission is proposing a six month regulation to allow flights to continue until a new agreement is in place, but it would require the UK government to offer the same to operators from EU countries. The UK has not yet responded to the proposal. The UK government has told pharmaceutical companies to stockpile and plan alternative supply routes in case of border problems. It has also arranged extra freight capacity for pharmaceutical companies should they need it. Ina memo, seen by the BBCin June, pharmaceutical companies warned the government that some stockpiles of medicines have been ""used up entirely"" by the coronavirus pandemic and said these could not be replenished in time for the UK's exit from the EU. The head of the Association of  the British Pharmaceutical Industrywarned,externalthat not having any sort of deal would cause ""increased complexity, duplication and cost"" in the middle of a pandemic. The government insisted, however, that ""robust contingency plans are in place"". For the coronavirus vaccine, the government says there are contingency plans for making sure the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine made in Belgium can be shipped to the UK if border problems arise. These include alternative sea routes and the use of freight oreven military aircraft. The European Commission has also proposed extending the deadline to reach an agreement on fishing until the end of December 2021. This would allow European fishing vessels to continue fishing in British waters and vice-versa for another year, or until an agreement is reached. But a Downing Street spokesman said the UK ""would never accept arrangements and access to UK fishing waters which are incompatible with our status as an independent coastal state"". The Ministry of Defence has saidit will make four patrol boats availableto monitor UK waters and added that it would have ""robust enforcement measures in place"". As things stand, if nothing is agreed then non-UK boats will not be allowed to fish in UK waters from January. But without a deal, the UK fishing industry would find its extensive exports to EU countries being hit by tariffs (import taxes) and regulatory hurdles. Why is fishing important in Brexit trade talks? The French government has said it would hand out compensation to trawlers if they were not able to fish in UK waters.

"On 1 January, Britain will stop following EU rules, and we'll have a new trade relationship with Europe. We don't yet know what that relationship will be, but the effect will be felt by everyone - in their shopping basket. Just over a quarter of all food eaten in the UK is produced in the EU. Even though the UK left the EU on 31 January this year, trading with the EU carried on as it did before. Spanish lettuce, Dutch tomatoes, French wine and Danish bacon came into the UK without checks on the border, and without the UK government applying any import taxes - known as tariffs. After 1 January, the rules change but agreement is still being negotiated, but there are two main possible outcomes. The UK and the EU may agree a new trade deal, which allows those imports to continue without tariffs being paid. Or, if the UK and the EU can't agree a deal, trade between the countries must follow to the rules set out by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) which include significant tariffs on foods heading in directions. Under WTO rules, supermarkets and other importers would have to pay substantial tariffs on many foods they bring in from the EU. Meat and dairy products face particularly high tariffs, but many other areas including fruit and vegetables would be also affected. As an extreme case, the London School of Economics estimates that some speciality cheeses such as halloumi and roquefort could be 55% more expensive. (Tariffs don't just apply to food - cars made in the EU, for instance, would attract a 10% tariff. But food and drinks are the area where the highest tariffs apply.) Government minister George Eustice said prices on average would rise less than 2% due to tariffs, although he admitted some items such as pork and beef would be hit harder. Tesco has saidprices could rise between 3% to 5%on average but ""vastly more on some selected items"" such as imported brie cheese. In the short term, shops could absorb those extra costs themselves. But in the longer term they would likely pass some or all of that cost on to customers, in the form of higher prices. French camembert and brie would be more expensive in the event of a no-deal Brexit Tariffs aren't the only reason why prices could rise. Retailers will have to fill in more paperwork when they bring food in and out of the UK, and producers could have to comply with different regulations on different sides of the channel. All of which costs money. That means that even if there is a deal which reduces all tariffs on imports from the EU to zero, prices could still rise. Adding all those costs up, the London School of Economics estimated that a trade deal would see an average price rise of 4.7% for unbranded food products imported from the EU. Without a deal they would rise by 12.5%. A no-deal scenario would mean significant extra paperwork and checks on goods entering the UK, which could delay some deliveries of food from the EU. Some British ports arealready seeing delays in getting shipments through, with increased traffic partly caused by importers rushing to beat the 1 January deadline. Many retailers including Tesco have been stockpiling goods in preparation for some disruption. Retailers are increasing their stocks of tins, toilet rolls and other longer life products, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) which speaks for the supermarkets and other shops, says. It specificallywarned people not to stockpile food at home, saying there will be sufficient supply of essential products. But perishable items cannot be stockpiled, and some could be in short supply in the early months of next year. The BRC says that lettuce, strawberries, raspberries and cut flowers are the most vulnerable to delays in shipping, but it doesn't expect these goods to be unavailable. More than half of all food consumed in the UK is currently produced in the UK. That proportion could be increased, but there are issues. Some food is just easier and cheaper to produce in sunnier places, especially when it's out of season in the UK. The UK could seek new suppliers for those products outside the EU, buying from Morocco instead of from Greece or Italy, for instance. But those imports may also be subject to tariffs, and longer distances would mean higher transport costs. In any case, it would take time for supermarkets to find new suppliers, whether at home or abroad, so there could be a delay. UK meat producers also say that if tariffs made it impossible to export animal parts which are difficult to sell in the UK, such as pigs' trotters, they would have to charge UK consumers more to make up for the loss. Farming and food processing also currently employ large numbers of migrants from the EU, who will find it harder to enter the UK next year when the new rules come into force. This could make it more difficult to scale up food production. Many UK growers depend on seasonal migrant workers from Eastern Europe Leaving the EU means the UK has the freedom to agree new trade deals with non-EU countries, which could bring down tariffs and give British shoppers access to cheaper food from countries like the US or Brazil. However, trade deals take a long time to negotiate. The UK can cut tariffs without doing trade deals, but WTO rules say it has to offer the same terms to every country that doesn't have a trade deal. So it could cut tariffs on EU imports to zero, as long as it cut tariffs to zero across the board. That would make many foods cheaper, but it would be devastating for many UK farmers who would struggle to compete with cheap imports.

"The pound has declined this week as hopes of a Brexit trade deal breakthrough waned The pound fell against the dollar on Friday after Prime Minister Boris Johnson said a no-deal Brexit looked ""very, very likely"". Sterling fell nearly 1.2% before clawing back some ground when both the German and Irish foreign ministers said an agreement between the UK and the EU is still possible. Both sides have until Sunday to reach a deal on trading from 1 January. Talks are deadlocked on a handful of key issues, including fishing quotas. The pound is trading 0.6% lower against the dollar at $1.3220, while it's down 0.3% against the euro to â¬1.0915. There had been speculation that the UK and the EU were close to a deal last weekend, however since then discussions have reached an impasse. Mr Johnson said: ""It's looking very, very likely we'll have to go for a solution that I think will be wonderful for the UK. ""If there's a big offer, a big change in what they're saying then I must say that I'm yet to see it."" CMC Markets analyst, David Madden, said: ""The UK-EU relationship has gone from bad to worse in the past 24 hours and that goes for sterling too. ""Traders are turning their back on the pound as the language being used now is more serious and a fears of a no-deal have increased considerably. But later on Friday, Germany's foreign minister Heiko Maas said: ""We believe finding a solution in the talks is difficult but possible."" His Irish counterpart Simon Coveney said he believed ""it's possible to get a deal on a future relationship and on a trade agreement."" PM and EU say trade deal unlikely by Sunday Brexit: 'I can't get my wine out of the EU' At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"First Minister Mark Drakeford has been giving an update on the pandemic He says a post-Christmas lockdown is not inevitable but will happen if Covid cases do not begin to fall Secondary schools in Wales will close this afternoon and move to online lessons for the last week of term One head teacher questions the short notice for the change of plan, saying it gave parents little time to make arrangements for keeping children at home Several councils say their primary schools will also close early next week James McCarthy and Andy Roberts Thanks for joining us for our live coverage of today's Welsh Government and Public Health Wales updates. The main points:  Until our next live blog, keep up to date via the BBC News website and social media channels. Stay safe, and have a good weekend. The seven-day case rates show that coronavirus remains most prevalent in urban areas of south Wales, with the lowest rates in north west Wales. The pattern has prompted appeals from political leaders in low incidence areas for regional variations in future restrictions. A further 29 people in Wales have died with coronavirus in Wales, taking the total to 2,818. Public Health Wales (PHW) data also showed 2,234 more people had tested positive for Covid-19, taking the total to 98,232 since the pandemic began. The majority of deaths have been in the Cwm Taf health board area of south Wales, followed by Betsi Cadwaladr in north Wales Britons holidaying on Spain's Canary Islands saytheir Christmas plans have been thrown into jeopardyafter quarantine rules were imposed. Travellers returning to the UK will have to self-isolate from Saturday due to rising infection rates, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said. Travel giant Tui said 800 people were due to depart for the islands on Friday morning, with 5,000 there already. The quarantine periodwill be shortened from 14 to 10 days from Monday. A statement from the four UK chief medical officers said the change came after a review of evidence and that self-isolation for those with coronavirus symptoms remained important. Meanwhile, the Foreign Office has yet to change its travel advice for the Canary Islands, meaning many holidaymakers may be unable to seek refunds or claim on their travel insurance policies. The Covid-19 pandemic hashighlighted the need for a fully-licenced medical school in north Wales, a GP has said. Medical students can currently study at Bangor University for the majority of their degree, but must complete some of their course in Cardiff. Dr Esyllt Llwyd, a GP in Waunfawr, Gwynedd, said having more locally-trained staff could have eased pressure on local services during the pandemic. The Welsh Government said the feasibility of a medical school was being assessed. Medical students can currently study at Bangor University for the majority of their degree, but must complete some of their course in Cardiff This video can not be played ""Twas the night before Christmas in Port Talbot town... the steelworks were silent, not making a sound."" Actor Michael Sheen reads a poem during a virtual switch-on of the Christmas lights in his home town of Port Talbot, with the event moving online because of coronavirus. Wales' first minister has changed his plans for Christmas and he will stay in Cardiff. Mr Drakeford, who is originally from Carmarthenshire, said previously he had planned to visit family over Christmas but today said he will be cutting down on travelling and contact with others before and over the holidays. The first minister said he'd follow the example of Wales' chief medical officer Frank Atherton who has also changed his plans. ""He's not planning to travel and he's not planning to see people who he was previously planning to see,"" Mr Drakeford said. ""I will be staying in Cardiff. I will be cutting down on  people that I see. I will be trying to create some headroom in advance for Christmas. ""And then I will operate entirely within the rules that are the same for every one of us."" Mark Drakeford has changed his Christmas plans Plaid Cymru have reacted to the Welsh Government's announcement of a possible lockdown after Christmas. Health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said: âYouâve only got to look at the trajectory that we are on, certainly for Wales as a whole, to see that if things donât improve, itâs very, very likely we will need tighter restrictions. âI do have a real interest in the idea though of acting in a regionally sensitive way. I think thatâs something that many people think is logical.â Mr ap Iorwerth said his own Ynys Mon constituency currently had low case numbers, but had seen larger outbreaks earlier in the year. He added: âThe problem with a fully national system is you are perhaps trying to balance whatâs effective in areas of high prevalence with whatâs acceptable in areas where itâs very low.â Rhun ap Iorwerth called for restrictions to be applied in a ""regionally sensitive"" way This video can not be played Head teachers in Wales have warned the move to online teaching at suchshort notice could be ""confusing"" for students. Secondary schools and further education colleges in Wales will move classes online from Monday. Owain Gethin Davies, headteacher at Ysgol Dyffryn Conwy, in Llanrwst, said he was concerned the ""swift move"" would affect the well-being of young people. Meanwhile Dave Roberts, a deputy head in Pontypridd, expects more parents to keep their children home from school although he is ""sympathetic"" to key workers who need childcare next week. The Welsh Governmentâs new restrictions plan would allow for
different alert levels across Wales, the first minister has confirmed. Mark Drakeford also said that any future lockdown would
not be time-limited, but reviewed âon a regular cycleâ. ""The plan will
allow differential levels in Wales if the circumstances allow that to happen,"" he said. âIt will set out that for that to happen, areas of Wales that
are differentiated from other parts of Wales will need to be in that position
for a reliable period of time, and we're not at that position today. âIf we were going today into level four then I would
confidently expect that to be a Wales-wide set of arrangements.â Mr Drakeford explained that any new lockdown âwill not be a
fire-break period of the sort we had back in October and November with a fixed
period of timeâ. âWe will explain it will be reviewed on a regular cycle, and
if it needed to be renewed it would have to be renewed,"" he said. Mr Drakeford also said that part of the reason for
publishing a new plan with clear criteria for moving between alert levels âis
to give hospitality and other sectors of the economy as long a period of notice
as we can because they will be able to see for themselves the way in which those
decisions will be made in futureâ. It's the final day in class for secondary school pupils in Wales afteryesterday's Welsh Government decision to move to online learningfor the last week of term. Cardiff head teacher Ian Loynd said it was ""the right decision"" but questioned the short-notice, which he said did not give parents much time to make arrangements to keep children at home. Schools have faced growing pressure from parents concerned their children would have to isolate over Christmas if a teacher or classmate tested positive for coronavirus. ""It's always a rapidly changing position and the news came late,"" Mr Loynd toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfastwith Oliver Hides. ""Heads had been asking (about the possibility of an early closure) for a number of weeks."" Mr Loynd said the decision came down to a choice between ""families voting with their feet"" or changing teaching in a ""calm and controlled way"". Introducing measures in response to the pandemic is a
constant âbalancing actâ, according to Wales' first minister. Mark Drakeford made the comments as he was asked about the
possibility of further restrictions being introduced. Speaking to reporters, Mr Drakeford said: âI took this press
conference twice last weekend and in both press conferences I was asked
repeatedly whether or not we were doing too much. âThis week the question is whether we are going far enough. âAnd I think that that just demonstrates that this is
constantly a balancing act. âIt is constantly trying to find the right set of measures
to address the issues that we are facing. âI believe that with the restrictions that we announced last
week, with the changes we are making this week in the health service, in
education, in relation to outdoor attractions that we have a package of
measures provided - and this is the most important part - provided in our own
life, we all do those things that have the biggest effect of all, but we have to
allow that package to have an impact. âIf it doesn't have it, if we don't manage to do that, then
I'm signalling clearly to people today that more will have to follow.â After announcing that outdoor attractions will
be told to close Mr Drakeford provided clarification that it wouldnât apply to
Christmas markets, but rather to attractions offering entertainment. Wales could be facing another lockdown if infection rates do not fall, the first minister warned The proportion     of people testing positive has risen in recent weeks in Wales, the latest     Office for National Statistics (ONS) infection survey estimates. It tookthroat and nose swab tests from more than 19,400 people at random in Wales over six weeks.,external From the results, it can estimate that 25,600 people in Wales had Covid-19 in the week to 4 December, 7,500 more than the week before. This is one in 120 people or 0.84% of the population. ONS said: ""Our modelling suggests that the percentage of those testing positive has increased in recent weeks in Wales."" The survey found a total of 142 positive tests, in 122 people from 99 households over six weeks. Similar surveys suggest cases have fallen in England (one in 115 people estimated to be infected) while falling back, although rising in London. In Northern Ireland it was estimated at one in 235 people and falling. Positivity rates in Scotland were stable (an estimated one in 120 people). Rates continue to be highest among secondary school-age children. Local breakdowns are not possible within Wales. A new plan setting out the Welsh Governmentâs approach to
lockdowns will be published on Monday and debated in the Senedd on Tuesday, First Minister Mark Drakeford said. Level 4 restrictions would be a âstep aboveâ the current
position, he said, adding that would mean âeven more restrictions on the
freedoms we are able to offer people if the numbers cannot be brought to a
position where they are falling away from where they are todayâ. In theory it would be possible in future to have different
restrictions in different parts of Wales, the first minister added. He said: âWe will also set out how, if it were to be the
case that some parts of Wales established themselves in a reliable and
predictable and sustainable way as having a different level of the virus to
other parts of Wales, it would be possible to have more than one level in
Wales. âThat is not the position we are in in Wales today - the
virus is rising everywhere.â Fairground attractions outside Cardiff Castle had replaced the traditional Winter Wonderland Cardiff Council confirmed the fairground rides outside Cardiff Castle will close from Monday in light of the decision to close schools next week. They were a replacement for the traditional Winter Wonderland ice rink attraction outside City Hall, which had been deemed unsuitable due to Covid restrictions. First Minister Mark Drakeford told the Welsh Government briefing that the closure of outdoor attractions across Wales would be announced later. Allow Twitter content?

A post-Christmas lockdownwill happen if the number of coronavirus cases does not begin to fall,First Minister Mark Drakeford said today. A five-day relaxation of rules begins on 23 December, but with more than 1,900 Covid patients in hospital there is pressure for tougher rules from the 28 December. Although Mr Drakeford said a new lockdown was ânot a foregone conclusionâ, he said: âOur NHS will not be able to cope if we continue to see this level of coronavirus-related admissions in the coming weeks, on top of the normal winter pressures.â Secondary schools are moving to online learning next week, with some primary schools following suit. And a new announcement today will see outdoor attractions also being closed. Mr Drakeford said: âI must be clear with you â if the strengthened measures of last week and the extra actions of this week, together with the efforts of each and every one of us do not succeed in turning the tide of the virus â then it is inevitable that we will have to move to alert level four after Christmas.â Alert level four is the highest level under the Welsh Governmentâs so-called traffic light system, and is equivalent to a lockdown. First Minister Mark Drakeford is about to give a Welsh Government update on the pandemic. You can watch it live on BBC One Wales, S4C,the BBC iPlayerand via the Wales Today Coronavirus Update video link above. A senior Tory has demanded clarity from Welsh ministers after reports they are considering severe Covid restrictions from 28 December. LBC radio cited an industry source saying Wales will be placed into lockdown-equivalent rules after Christmas. Welsh Conservative health spokesman Andrew RT Davies said First Minister Mark Drakeford should make an ""urgent statement"". The Welsh Government said ministers are keeping all measures under review. Rules will be relaxed for five days during the Christmas period, 23-27 December, across the UK to allow three households to meet.

"A man dubbed Osama Bin Laden's spokesman in Europe has returned to the UK after being released from a US jail. Adel Abdul Bary was deported after a senior New York judge concluded the prisoner had a high risk of contracting Covid-19, partly because of his weight. In 1998, Bary was the Europe-based publicist for al-Qaeda leaders and told journalists that the terror group had bombed US embassies in east Africa. MI5 and counter-terrorism police are reviewing his return and resettlement. In 1999, Scotland Yard detectives arrested Bary as a co-conspirator to the embassy attacks. More than 200 people were killed in Nairobi and Dar Es Salaam - al-Qaeda's then biggest single attack against American targets. That arrest - and those of other major UK-based suspects - triggered a mammoth extradition battle that lasted until 2012, when he was eventually flown to the US. He went on to admit helping to plan the bombings. His confession to a federal court in Manhattan confirmed that, working out of London, he had sent messages from journalists to Osama bin Laden - and also faxed news organisations confirming al-Qaeda had been behind the embassy attacks. In October this year, US authorities approved Bary's release after he had served 21 years of his 25-year sentence. His release had been pencilled in for the end of the year, after US authorities took into account the 14 years he had spent in prison in the UK before his extradition and his good behaviour since then. The US embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, was targeted by a bomb in August 1998 But it was brought forward slightly after a court heard evidence that he had a high risk of catching and dying from Covid, if he was kept in prison any longer. In the October ruling sanctioning Bary's release, US federal Judge Lewis Kaplan said that mercy should allow the offender to be with his family, given it may be the final period of his life. ""The [US] government concedes that the defendant has provided extraordinary and compelling reasons for his release,"" said the judge. ""The government notes that the defendant was diagnosed as obese in 2019 and that, as of April 2020, his body mass index was 36, which is well above the threshold for obesity. ""On that basis, the government concedes that defendant has presented an extraordinary and compelling circumstance [for release]. Following his release from a federal jail, US immigration officials took him to a detention centre before putting him on a flight to the UK on Tuesday. After arriving in London, Bary - who is Egyptian - is believed to have been taken to his family home. The now 60-year-old's US lawyer previously told journalists his client now wished to live a quiet life. When prisoners convicted of terrorism offences are released from jail in the UK, the case for continuing to monitor them is considered by a team of police and probation officers, who also take into account intelligence from MI5. Some offenders quietly get on with their lives and are eventually placed on the Security Service's massive list of former terrorism suspects. Others who have maintained ties with extremists - or try to resurrect them after years in jail - are subject to ongoing investigations. Next year, inquests will be held into how one released offender went on to murder two people in London in 2019.

"CCTV footage of Sinaga near his flat was used as evidence at his trials Serial rapist Reynhard Sinaga is believed to have targeted more than 200 victims, 60 of whom remain unidentified, police have said. Sinaga, described as Britain's most prolific rapist,was found guiltyin January of luring 48 men to his Manchester flat and filming himself sexually assaulting and raping them. Hisminimum jail term has been extended from 30 to 40 yearsat the High Court. Police now believe Sinaga committed sexual offences against 206 men. Sinaga, who was a postgraduate student , would wait for men leaving nightclubs and bars before leading them to his Princess Street flat on the edge of the city centre. This video can not be played Who is Reynhard Sinaga? The BBC's Judith Moritz reports on the case He drugged his victims before assaulting them while they were unconscious, often filming his rapes and collecting so-called trophies from them, such as mobile phones. When the victims woke up many had no memory of what had happened. He was caught after one victim awoke as he was being abused and defended himself, before reporting the incident. Serial rapists receive longer minimum jail terms The sexual predator who waited outside nightclubs File on 4: Britain's most prolific rapist When officers seized Sinaga's phone, they found hundreds of hours of footage of the attacks, a discovery which led to the launch of the largest rape inquiry in British history. Police say Sinaga assaulted 206 men, but many have not been identified Sinaga, originally from Indonesia, lived in a rented flat just a few moments' walk from the Factory 251 nightclub. His trial was told he typically approached his victims, mostly men in their late teens or early 20s who had been out drinking, in the street and brought them back to his apartment. Many could not remember what happened, but some recalled being given a drink and then blacking out. Most were unaware they had been raped until they were contacted by police. Sinaga claimed all the sexual activity was consensual and that each man had agreed to being filmed while pretending to be asleep. In victim impact statements read out at the trial, one man said Sinaga had ""destroyed a part of my life"", while another said he had ""periods where I can't get up and face the day"". Evidence given in the trial suggested Sinaga drugged the men by giving them spiked drinks Assistant Chief Constable Mabs Hussain said as a result of further evidence ""coming to light"" since the trial, investigators had identified a further 23 victims and ""now believe that Sinaga committed sexual offences against 206 men"". ""We are yet to identify around 60 of these men and would urge anyone who thinks they may have been a victim to please get in touch with us,"" he added. After his trial concluded, Sinaga's case was referred to the Court of Appeal by the Attorney General under the unduly lenient sentence scheme. Judges rejected calls for a whole-life jail term but increased the minimum time he must spend in prison. They noted he had not shown any remorse.

"Campaigners had sought to prevent Brandon Bernard's execution Death row inmate Brandon Bernard has been executed in Indiana after last-minute clemency pleas were rejected by the US Supreme Court. Bernard, 40, was convicted of murder in 1999 when he was a teenager, and is the youngest offender to be executed by the federal government in nearly 70 years. Bernard told the family of the couple he killed he was sorry, before dying by lethal injection on Thursday. Four more executions are planned before the end of Donald Trump's presidency. In Trumpâs final days, a rush of federal executions US executes federal inmate for 1994 murder If all five take place, Mr Trump will have overseen the most executions by a US president in more than a century. It would bring to 13 the total of federal executions since July. They break with an 130-year-old precedent of pausing executions amid a presidential transition. Joe Biden becomes president on 20 January. Bernard was pronounced dead at 21:27 local time on Thursday (02:27 GMT Friday) at a penitentiary in the city of Terre Haute. Before that he directed his last words to the victims' family, speaking calmly for more than three minutes. ""I'm sorry. That's the only words that I can say that completely capture how I feel now and how I felt that day,"" he said, according to the Associated Press. The execution was delayed for more than two hours after Bernard's lawyers asked in vain for the Supreme Court to halt it. He was given the death penalty for his involvement in the murder of Todd and Stacie Bagley in June 1999. He was one of five teenagers accused of robbing the pair and forcing them into the boot of their car in Texas. They were shot as they lay in the boot by 19-year-old accomplice Christopher Vialva before Bernard set the car alight. Defence lawyers say both of the Bagleys probably died before the car was set on fire, and an independent investigator hired by the defence saidStacie had been ""medically dead"" before the fire.,external However, government testimony during the trial said that although Todd Bagley had died instantly, Stacie had had soot in her airway, signalling that she had died from smoke inhalation and not the gunshot wound. Bernard's lawyers say he feared what would happen to him if he refused to follow the orders of Vialva, who was executed in September. Others involved in the incident were given prison sentences as they were under 18 and classed as juveniles. Bernard's lawyers argued that he should be given life in prison without parole, as, throughout his time in jail, he maintained a good record and worked with outreach programmes to stop people from getting involved in crime. The federal prosecutor who defended Bernard's death sentence had called forBernard to see out his sentence in prison,external. In an opinion piece published in the Indianapolis Star, Angela Moore wrote: ""Having learned so much since 2000 about the maturation of the human brain and having seen Brandon grow into a humble, remorseful adult fully capable of living peacefully in prison, how can we say he is among that tiny group of offenders who must be put to death?"" The resumption of federal executions has drawn protests in Terre Haute this year Five of the surviving nine jurors called for Mr Trump tocommute Bernard's death sentence,external. Tens of thousands of other people urged the president to grant Bernard clemency, includingsenators Richard J Durbin and Cory Brooker,external. On Thursday, leading lawyers Allen Dershowitz and Ken Starr also joined his defence team. Reality television star Kim Kardashian West sent numerous tweets about Bernard's case to her followers in the run-up to the execution, urging them to get behind the cause and raise awareness.

Ms Kardashian West is studying to be a lawyer in California and has previously helped sway criminal cases. In Marchshe visited the White House with three women whose jail terms were cutby President Trump. The families of Todd and Stacie Bagley both expressed gratitude to President Trump, Attorney General William Barr and other officials. Todd Bagley's family said it had been ""very difficult"" to wait 21 years for the sentence imposed ""on those who cruelly participated in the destruction of our children, to be finally completed"". ""The lives of family and friends were shattered and we all have grieved for 21 years waiting for justice to finally be served,"" the statement said. ""Thank you to all who were involved in this process of getting justice for Todd and Stacie."" Stacie and Todd Bagley Stacie Bagley's family said their lives had been changed forever by the murders. They said Stacie still had the chance of survival until the car was set on fire. ""God will forgive us of our sins, but the consequences of our sin will always play out,"" the statement read.

Here's what you need to know about the pandemic in the UK before we do: Ski resorts in Spain have announced that they will be opening ahead
of the Christmas break despite concerns among European countries about the possible spread of infections. Many resorts have delayed their opening due to the pandemic, but resorts
in Catalonia are set to open on Monday 14 November, according to AFP news agency. Special measures are in place in Spain's resorts, such asreduced
capacity on lifts and in restaurants and bars.,external Other countries such as France, Germany and Italy will keep its
resorts closed over the Christmas period. Italy, supported by Germany, wanted a European agreement to close
all ski resorts over the holiday. However, ski resorts in countries including
Spain, Switzerland and Austriaall released plans to
open. Warner Bros will release its live action Tom and Jerry both online and in cinemas The company that owns the UK's Odeon Cinemas has secured $100m (Â£76m) in emergency funds amid concerns about Covid-19 - but warned the money will only help it through another month. AMC Entertainment Holdings, the world's largest movie theatre operator, said attendance has dropped 92% in the US and 86% internationally. The pandemic has meant that some cinemas have shut and audiences have stayed away. The company is burning through $125m a month. ""Our current cash burn rates are not sustainable,"" it said. Even once cinemas reopened this year, it said the growth of streaming posed a challenge. Warner Bros this month said it planned to release all of its 2021 films online on the same day they are released to cinemas. They will air on the HBO Max streaming service, with which it shares a parent company. Disney has also said it plans to push more of its films to its Disney+ streaming service.

South Africa's top judge says he is unconcerned about criticism after a video showing him falsely suggesting that Covid-19 vaccines could alter people's DNA and insert satanic elements within them was widely shared online. Speaking to the media on Friday, Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng said he expected a backlash for the comments he made on Thursday at a prayer event. He told reporters that he was concerned about a report he saw that suggested that the Covid-19 vaccine would be mandatory. ""It must be voluntary... You can't impose a vaccine on people. Why should you?""news site EWN quotes the judge as saying.,external His opinion on Covid-19 vaccines has divided South Africans. There have been concerns that rich countries may be buying up most of the newly developed vaccines, not leaving enough for countries in Africa, although both Nigeria and Uganda have said they have ordered millions of doses. A study of coronavirus patients in intensive care has found that
some people become more susceptible to severe Covid-19 symptoms than others. Scientists looked into the DNA of more than 2,200 patients in UK
hospitals. They looked at each personâs genes, which contain the instructions
for every biological process â including how to fight a virus. Their genomes were then compared with those of healthy people to
pinpoint any genetic differences. The findings shed light on where the immune system goes wrong,
which could help identify new treatments. You can read

Speaking at the Welsh Government's press conference, Mark Drakeford said while stricter rules were not a ""foregone conclusion"", the NHS will ""not be able to cope"" if admissions continue to rise. Next week the Welsh Government will publish a ""Covid control plan"", laying out four alert levels of restrictions that could be imposed. Read more about the rules in Wales here. About 2,000 troops were deployed to Liverpool in November Army regiments that helped set up and run a mass coronavirus testing pilot in Liverpool are to be given the Freedom of the City - the city's the highest civic honour. Around 2,000 troops were deployed to Liverpool in November, where they helped carry out 200,000 tests at almost 50 centres. The city's coronavirus infection rates have since dropped from 680 cases per 100,000 people to fewer than 100. It enabled the city region to move down from tier three to tier two when the national lockdown ended. Brigadier Joe Fossey, commander of the 8th Engineer Brigade, which led the operation, said he was ""extremely proud of what we have all achieved in such a short time and how warmly we have been received by all those in the city"". ""To receive Liverpool's highest civic honour crowns an extraordinary six weeks for all of us and marks an important moment in the continuing fight against Covid-19,"" he added. Read full story here.

But the bus driver took a detour to get her there on time, saying it was ""just the right thing to do"". Alec Bailey told his other passengers he would take a detour to get her as close to the home as possible. ""When the woman said to me she hadn't seen her mum in a long time, it just hit my heart,"" he said.

In projections released on Friday, the agency predicts at
least 90,000 more cases by Christmas Day - but says this figure could reach 135,000. It alsoestimated that there could be between 1,300 and 1,800 deaths in the weeks leading up to by 25 December,external. More than 445,000 cases have been confirmed in Canada and 13,130
people have died since the pandemic began. Chief Public Health Officer Theresa Tam said ""a stronger
response is needed now in all large provinces to slow the spread of Covid-19"". Canada's health regulator approved the Pfizer-BioNTech
vaccine the day after the UK became the first country in the world to roll it
out. Health Canada said thevaccine met its ""stringent safety, efficacy and quality requirements"". Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada will receive
up to 249,000 doses of the vaccine this month. The Canadian government has
purchased 20 million doses of the vaccine - enough to inoculate 10 million
people - with the option to buy 56 million more. A new-born giraffe has been named Margaret in honour of the world's first Covid vaccine patient. Staff at Whipsnade Zoo in Bedfordshire picked the name because the female calf was born on Tuesday - thesame day Margaret Keenan, 90, received the Pfizer/BioNTech jab in Coventry. She was the first person to receive the jab outside of a clinical trial. Team leader Mark Holden said: ""The arrival of our precious giraffe calf on the same day, and actually at the same time, as the much-anticipated Covid-19 vaccination was first administered feels like a real moment of hope, and one we are so keen to celebrate and remember."" The zoo says it hopes Mrs Keenan will be able to visit her namesake one day soon. It might be found at the bottom of the globe, but New Zealand has been at the top of the movie industry in 2020. Thanks to its handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, the country is enjoying an unprecedented boom in film production, with directors seeking safe conditions, and that most elusive thing this year - a normal life. International blockbusters including James Cameron's Avatar sequels, Amazon's Lord of the Rings series and Jane Campion's The Power of the Dog - starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Kirsten Dunst - all managed complex film shoots in New Zealand this year. The country's home-grown movies have also received a boost at the box office by Kiwis supporting their industry, leading one local filmmaker to joke that they're now living in ""the Hollywood of the Pacific"". New Zealand, like so many other countries, did experience a lockdown in March, But because it managed to eliminate community transmission of the virus,apart from an incident in Auckland in August,film production could resume by summer, with Avatar one of the first projects to start up again. Read more on this story from the BBC's Emma Jones here. Pallab GhoshScience correspondent, BBC News The latest estimate of the R number for the UK is 0.9 and 1 â up very slightly on the previous week â according to the latest Office for National Statistics infection survey This means that the epidemic is still shrinking after lockdown measures, but very slowly. The survey indicates that cases continued to fall in most of England and Northern Ireland last week. But the view of the governmentâs scientific advisors is that the situation is fragile. Cases are increasing in London and the East of England â especially among secondary school age children â and previous experience indicates that a surge among older age groups will inevitably follow. The advisors believe that it will be important to keep infection levels as low as possible in the run up to the holidays. Thatâs because the relaxation of restrictions that permit families to meet over Christmas will accelerate any increase in cases â and lead to another sharp spike in infections early in the New Year. Students aged 14 to 16 will switch to remote learning in
Sweden's capital, Stockholm, local authorities have announced. Lessons should be switched to online as
soon as possible, they added. ""We need to dramatically reduce the amount of contact between one another, "" said Maria Rotzen Ostlund,the region's infectious diseases doctor,external. She said that distance learning would not be enough and
stressed the importance of limiting social contacts to as few people as
possible. Ostlund also recommended that employers allow their staff
to work from home where possible. Stockholm is one of the worst affected regions in the
country, accounting for a third of Sweden's confirmed Covid-related death toll, according to Reuters news agency. The Swedish government is aiming to offer the vaccine to all of thoseover the age of 18 during the first half of 2021.,external Sweden has recorded 312,728 cases and 7,354 deaths since the
pandemic began, according to Johns Hopkins University. A recommended Â£3,300 pay rise for UK MPs has been scrapped over concerns it would ""not reflect the reality"" the public is facing during the pandemic. The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority ordered a pay freeze for the next financial year. The basic salary for MPs is currently Â£79,468-a-year, and many were already promising to refuse or give away the extra money at a time when many of their constituents were struggling. Prime Minister Boris Johnson had also joined Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer in urging the IPSA not to go ahead with its plans. The rise was set in October - based on the official statistic for public sector earnings growth.  But IPSA came under more pressure to scrap it after thechancellor imposed a pay cap on millions of public sector workersbecause of the financial impact of Covid on government finances. IPSA chairman Richard Lloyd wrote to MPs saying a pay rise ""would result in a salary increase for MPs that would be inconsistent with the wider economic data and would not reflect the reality that many constituents are facing this year"".

This video can not be played The World Health Organization's regional director for Europe, Hans Kluge, has backed a warning from German Chancellor Angela Merkel that it will take some time for the new coronavirus vaccines to turn the pandemic around. Mrs Merkel told the German parliament the country would not be able to vaccinate enough of its citizens to change the course of the pandemic in the first quarter of 2021. Mr Kluge said the delayed effects of vaccination programmes highlighted the need to prioritise key workers and vulnerable groups first. He also warned of the effects of relaxing rules too much around Christmas: ""I am very concerned. Now every 17 seconds someone is dying of Covid-19, which may double if people are relaxing,"" he told BBC World News. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst People are screened at a clinic in Huanggang, in China's central Hubei province (file photo) A number of people in central China have been fined and
told to self-isolate after they bought imported pork online that could potentially
have been contaminated with Covid-19. According to the national Global Times newspaper, 24
residents in Huanggang, central Hubei province, have been fined 200 yuan
(Â£23; $30.50) for buying imported pork from Brazil via the Meituan shopping
platform. The pork should have been destroyed rather than sold because, as
the newspaper notes,batches had already tested positive for Covid-19,external. An investigation is now being carried out into the
shopping platform. One of the big concerns in China is how imported food might carry the virus, and so the country is stepping up regulation to
prevent ordinary consumers from directly getting their hands on such goods. This week, China's top court announced that e-commerce platforms
could be ""held legally responsible for food safety issues,externalrelated to products
purchased on their platforms"". China says that many of its localised Covid-19 outbreaks over the
last year have been linked to imported cold-chain goods, and there are regular
news stories about coastal regions discovering the virus on overseas goods.
Many of the first patients in cities that have experienced outbreaks have been
workers who handle such products. UK airport operator Heathrow has said it will keep Terminal 4 closed until the end of next year as the pandemic continues to affect travel. The company said passenger numbers at the airport - usually one of the busiest in the world - fell 88% in November ""as travel restrictions and a second lockdown took their toll"". Based on forecasts and current traffic, it said it would extend the closure of Terminal 4 until the end of 2021. Heathrow shut the terminal in May during the first national lockdown. It led to airlines such as Air France, Etihad and KLM moving to Terminal 2. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Black workers at Lloyds Bank are paid a fifth less than their white colleagues, the company has disclosed. The discrepancy is because they ""are disproportionately under-represented at senior levels"" the bank said. Black staff make up 1.5% of Lloyds' total workforce and 0.6% of its senior management. ""That's not good enough - which is why we have resolved to take action,"" said the bank's chief executive AntÃ³nio Horta-OsÃ³rio. Lloyds has pledged to increase the number of black staff in senior roles to at least 3% by 2025 to bring it into line with the black population in England and Wales. Lloyds is the first major UK bank to reveal its ethnicity pay gap. Its figures, which were compiled in April, showed the median pay gap between black staff and their colleagues was 19.7%, while the bonus gap stood at 37.6%. Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) workers account for 10.3% of all staff at Lloyds, and 7.3% of senior management. The median pay gap between BAME staff and colleagues was 14.8%, while the bonus pay gap stood at 32.5%. For Asian employees, the median pay gap stood at 15.7% and the bonus pay gap at 34.2%. ""These figures serve as a wake-up call that we must do better. No excuses,"" said Fiona Cannon, director of group sustainable business at Lloyds. ""They highlight the urgent need for us to increase representation at senior grades, which will not only improve our ethnicity pay gap, but also make us better colleagues, better employers and a better bank."" Alongside the publication of its first Ethnicity Pay Gap Report as part of its part of its Race Action Plan, Lloyds launched a black business advisory committee. It will be led by former Cabinet Office adviser and social entrepreneur Claudine Reid MBE to investigate the barriers to growth for the black business community. Social entrepreneur Claudine Reid will lead a black business advisory committee at Lloyds ""Disappointingly, the number of Black FTSE 100 chief executives, chief financial officers or chairs has fallen to 0.7%,"" said Ms Reid. ""I've taken on this role to help the UK's largest financial services group on its journey of change and transformation."" Mr Horta-OsÃ³rio, who will step down from his role as chief executive next year, said: ""We want to be clear that we are an anti-racist organisation - one where all employees speak up, challenge, and act to take an active stance against racism. In doing so, our colleagues will help break down the barriers preventing people from meeting their full potential."" Financial services union Accord, said; ""The harsh reality is that race still plays a significant role in determining pay and career progression. ""The problem isn't going to magic itself away but we stand ready to work with employers on practical steps to tackle inequality and discrimination in the workplace in a meaningful and enduring way."" It said Lloyds should be ""commended"" for publishing the information. ""Other companies should do so too and government needs to step up too by introducing mandatory ethnicity pay gap reporting as a first step,"" it added. Most minority ethnic groups earned less on average than white British people in 2019, according to official figures published by the Office for National Statistics. The median hourly pay gap was worse for Pakistanis at 16%, while it stood at 15% for Bangladeshis and African workers. However, the median hourly pay gap between ethnic minorities and white British workers stood at 2.3%, its narrowest level since 2012, after having risen to 8.4% in 2014.

"All pupils, their families and teachers in parts of London, Kent and Essex should take a Covid test, Matt Hancock has said, as he set out a mass testing scheme for secondary schools. Extra mobile testing units will be sent out after east London and parts of Kent and Essex became some of England's major coronavirus hotspots. Cases in these areas have risen fast, especially among 11 to 18-year-olds. One London head teacher said the extra tests had been ""a long time coming"". Ges Smith, head teacher at Jo Richardson Community School in Dagenham, said he would ""strongly encourage"" his pupils to get tested but added: ""As far as I know we have got no mandate on forcing students to take that test."" Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""I urge every student, parent and teacher in these areas to step forward for testing - irrespective of whether they have symptoms. While Covid-19 may be lower risk to children and young people, it still poses a significant risk to their families and communities."" He said he wanted to keep schools and colleges open but needed to target rising infection rates. Covid tests at university find few positive cases Will there be mass testing at your child's school? London's coronavirus levels rising, ONS says Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said many parts of the country had higher infection rates than the places where the secondary school mass testing scheme was being rolled out. The government should commit to a rolling out mass testing for schools across the country, including to primary schools in areas where rates for those age groups were high. A teacher from the Midlands, who asked to remain anonymous, said he was upset at the focus on London and the south east. ""It shows clear preferential treatment when London schools get offered mass testing, yet the Midlands and the North, which have been under massive pressure for months, have never been offered this mass testing,"" he told the BBC. ""Will they (the government) now roll out mass testing to other hard-hit areas in the North and Midlands?"" He said his school had ""been under massive pressure"" since reopening, ""with close to 100 positive cases of both children and staff"". The government said all local authorities in England's top tier three of Covid restrictions had been invited to apply for a six-week community testing programme followinga mass testing trial in Liverpool. Mass testing aims to find people who might be infected but not yet displaying symptoms so they can be told to isolate. Mass Covid testing is going to become an ever bigger part of the attempt to keep schools open - and expect to see much more of it in the new year, for staff and pupils. But this latest intervention seems to be more about targeting young people in this secondary school age group, in these hotspot areas, rather than entire school year groups being screened. It's community testing with a focus on the rising infection rates among young people, rather than head teachers organising mass testing in schools. There will be 15 mobile testing units ""in or near schools"" in London, but it seems so far unlikely to be schools testing pupils in the way universities carried out mass testing of students. This will also raise questions. If there are such concerns about this age group, why not send pupils home to study online for the last few days of term -as has happened in Wales? There have been consistent warnings aboutCovid hitting attendance in schools- so why is this testing appearing now when the term is almost over? And schools in northern England, struggling for months with high levels of infections, will be irritated at the sudden urgency of efforts to prevent London moving up to tier three restrictions. There is also politics behind this. Aftera summer of U-turns, the government will do everything it can to keep schools open in England. The areas receiving extra tests for secondary schools include: The seven worst-affected London boroughs, which are Barking and Dagenham, Hackney, Havering, Newham, Redbridge, Tower Hamlets and Waltham Forest The City of London The Essex areas of Southend, Basildon, Canvey Island, Harlow and Brentwood The Kent areas of Swale, Thanet and Maidstone Mr Hancock said both PCR (a standard coronavirus test) and lateral flow testing - which takes about half an hour to show a result - would be used. In a joint statement, the Department for Education and Department of Health said an extra 15 mobile testing units would be sent out in or near schools in the capital for staff, students and their families to be tested, providing about 75,000 tests. And 44,000 home test kits will be made available for school staff to be tested before term begins in January. Covid tests for secondaries in 'concerning' areas Rising numbers of pupils sent home in England Rapid coronavirus test use defended In Essex, 10 mobile testing units will be deployed tomorrow and over the weekend, while Kent will have a further 12 mobile testing units by the start of next week. Four of the affected London boroughs were among the 20 places with the highest case rates in last week, according to Public Health England. These were Havering (400.7 cases per 100,000 people), Barking and Dagenham (333.5), Waltham Forest (327.1) and Redbridge (310.3). Some 21 of London's 32 boroughs have infection rates higher than overall rate for England of 150 cases per 100,000 people. Taken together, London's outer boroughs have an infection rate of 205 cases per 100,000. That is higher than the rate in Leicestershire, Tees Valley or Bristol, which are all under tier-three rules - the highest level - meaning people can only meet other households in outdoor public spaces such as parks, where the rule of six applies. What are the latest tiers and lockdown rules? SCHOOLS:What happens if pupils catch coronavirus? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? TEACHERS:Are they are at risk? Kent is in tier three but London and Essex are currently in tier two - meaning no household mixing is allowed indoors and the rule of six applies outdoors. Mr Hancock urged Londonersto ""stick by the rules"" this week amid fears the capital might be moved into tier threewhen the tiers are reviewed next week. About 99% of England's population are living in areas in the strictest two tiers of coronavirus rules, including more than 32 million in tier-two areas and more than 23 million in tier three. Schools in England have been given permission to close a day early for the Christmas holidaysto reduce the chances of teachers having to spend their time off speaking to contact tracersabout potential Covid cases. Meanwhile, more than 50 schools in Belfast have written to Northern Ireland's education ministerurging him to reconsider his decision not to close schools early in the run-up to Christmas. The Scottish government considered extending the Christmas school holidaysto limit the spread of the virus after families get together during the festive period - but decided against it last week. In Wales,all secondary schools and many primary schools will move classes onlinefrom Monday. Some teachers have criticised the move,saying they have had insufficient time to make arrangements.

"Campaigners had sought to prevent Brandon Bernard's execution Death row inmate Brandon Bernard has been executed in Indiana after last-minute clemency pleas were rejected by the US Supreme Court. Bernard, 40, was convicted of murder in 1999 when he was a teenager, and is the youngest offender to be executed by the federal government in nearly 70 years. Bernard told the family of the couple he killed he was sorry, before dying by lethal injection on Thursday. Four more executions are planned before the end of Donald Trump's presidency. In Trumpâs final days, a rush of federal executions US executes federal inmate for 1994 murder If all five take place, Mr Trump will have overseen the most executions by a US president in more than a century. It would bring to 13 the total of federal executions since July. They break with an 130-year-old precedent of pausing executions amid a presidential transition. Joe Biden becomes president on 20 January. Bernard was pronounced dead at 21:27 local time on Thursday (02:27 GMT Friday) at a penitentiary in the city of Terre Haute. Before that he directed his last words to the victims' family, speaking calmly for more than three minutes. ""I'm sorry. That's the only words that I can say that completely capture how I feel now and how I felt that day,"" he said, according to the Associated Press. The execution was delayed for more than two hours after Bernard's lawyers asked in vain for the Supreme Court to halt it. He was given the death penalty for his involvement in the murder of Todd and Stacie Bagley in June 1999. He was one of five teenagers accused of robbing the pair and forcing them into the boot of their car in Texas. They were shot as they lay in the boot by 19-year-old accomplice Christopher Vialva before Bernard set the car alight. Defence lawyers say both of the Bagleys probably died before the car was set on fire, and an independent investigator hired by the defence saidStacie had been ""medically dead"" before the fire.,external However, government testimony during the trial said that although Todd Bagley had died instantly, Stacie had had soot in her airway, signalling that she had died from smoke inhalation and not the gunshot wound. Bernard's lawyers say he feared what would happen to him if he refused to follow the orders of Vialva, who was executed in September. Others involved in the incident were given prison sentences as they were under 18 and classed as juveniles. Bernard's lawyers argued that he should be given life in prison without parole, as, throughout his time in jail, he maintained a good record and worked with outreach programmes to stop people from getting involved in crime. The federal prosecutor who defended Bernard's death sentence had called forBernard to see out his sentence in prison,external. In an opinion piece published in the Indianapolis Star, Angela Moore wrote: ""Having learned so much since 2000 about the maturation of the human brain and having seen Brandon grow into a humble, remorseful adult fully capable of living peacefully in prison, how can we say he is among that tiny group of offenders who must be put to death?"" The resumption of federal executions has drawn protests in Terre Haute this year Five of the surviving nine jurors called for Mr Trump tocommute Bernard's death sentence,external. Tens of thousands of other people urged the president to grant Bernard clemency, includingsenators Richard J Durbin and Cory Brooker,external. On Thursday, leading lawyers Allen Dershowitz and Ken Starr also joined his defence team. Reality television star Kim Kardashian West sent numerous tweets about Bernard's case to her followers in the run-up to the execution, urging them to get behind the cause and raise awareness.

"Australia will maintain its Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine orders but cancel another type A promising Australian candidate for a coronavirus vaccine has been abandoned after trial participants returned false HIV positive results. Australia had previously agreed to buy 51 million doses of the vaccine being developed by Australian firm CSL and the University of Queensland (UQ). The government said orders of other vaccines would now fill the shortfall. CSL and UQ stressed that the positive results were false - meaning trial participants' health was not at risk. The Australian government said it had now entered an agreement for the Novavax vaccine, and upped its existing order of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine. The UK was the first to begin rolling out a vaccine from Pfizer this week. First person receives Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine The vaccine had been in stage one of trials, and proving to be effective in making antibodies. But it also generated HIV antibodies in some recipients - which meant it showed false positives for HIV. Further testing proved the HIV wasn't there. CSL and UQ said fixing the flaw would take about a year, prompting a decision to abandon the trial. ""It was likely to work. But we knew that we didn't want to have any issues with confidence, and this false-positive test may have caused some confusion and lack of confidence,"" said Brendan Murphy, secretary of Australia's Department of Health. More about the vaccines: How will I get a coronavirus vaccine? Who will get the vaccine first and when can you have it? Your Questions Answered: How do we know the vaccine is safe? Two full doses of the Oxford vaccine gave 62% protection, a half dose followed by a full dose was 90% and overall the trial showed 70% protection. Vaccine co-lead Paul Young described the decision as ""devastating"" after 11 months of ""living and breathing this project"". ""While this is a tough decision to take, the urgent need for a vaccine has to be everyone's priority,"" he said. Other medical experts have also praised the ""realistic"" decision to abandon the UQ vaccine, saying it reflects the reality of vaccine development. ""In general, about 90% of vaccines never make it to market. As a global community, we have been spoilt with the unprecedented swiftness and success with which the development of Covid-19 vaccines have taken place,"" said infectious diseases expert Sanjaya Senanayake from the Australian National University. Australia has all but eliminated community transmission of the virus, after getting on top of outbreaks in recent months. Prof Murphy said the nation was in a ""wonderful position"" at present, but there would be ""full population coverage"" from two vaccines in 2021. ""We don't need emergency approval - we're in a good position because we've controlled the virus,"" he said on Friday. ""So I'm very confident about the successful vaccination strategy that we'll be facing next year."" The government said it had prepared for this sort of situation and as such had ""spread the risk"" with multiple deals for vaccines. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said focusing Australia's manufacturing efforts on the other vaccines would mean ""we are more likely to have the entire population vaccinated earlier rather than later"". The Oxford vaccine has been found to be ""safe and effective"", according to researchers, but is awaiting approval from regulators around the world. Early 2021 is still listed as when the first vaccines - most likely from Oxford/AstraZeneca - are scheduled to be given to Australians. Australia has a population of 25 million people. It recorded just one case of local transmission in the past week. The nation has reported 908 deaths and 28,000 cases so far during the pandemic - far fewer than many nations. It has been praised for responding quickly to the pandemic with border shutdowns, lockdown measures and aggressive contract-tracing efforts. Some failures, however, have been blamed for deaths.

"The mass Covid testing of students before Christmas has so far found 0.2% testing positive at one of the universities taking part. The University of Portsmouth is reporting ""very low numbers"" of positive cases from its Covid testing. ""We are seeing fewer than two per day on average at present,"" said vice-chancellor Graham Galbraith. He criticised a ""blame culture"" in which students had been accused of spreading infections. ""Prevalence in students is now very low indeed,"" said Prof Galbraith. Edge Hill University in Lancashire says it has so far found zero positive cases in its end-of-term testing. The mass testing of students, launched on campuses last week, has been screening hundreds of thousands of students preparing to leave for the Christmas holidays. Student Covid testing begins ahead of Christmas break Two Covid tests and leave within 24 hours Rapid mass testing to get students home for Christmas There are no national figures so far on results from university testing, but some early findings are being published. These include results so far from four universities - but it is not known how representative they might be of the wider picture. The mostrecent figures for the general population show wide regional differences,externalin rates of testing positive, including those without symptoms - from 1.3% in the north west of England to 0.4% in the south west. Covid testing at the University of Portsmouth has so far found few positive cases At the University of Portsmouth, an initial sample of about 4,500 students, showed a rate of 0.2% positive results, or about nine students. The University of Cambridge had even lower positive results last week from tests for those who did not have any Covid symptoms - with zero positive cases from more than 10,000 students being screened. There were separate figures from Cambridge for those who thought they had Covid symptoms - with nine cases being confirmed out of 71 tested. Cambridge has run its own test and tracking system throughout the term. ""Where outbreaks did occur, the testing programme helped us identify these quickly and put measures in place to prevent them spreading further,"" said Patrick Maxwell, regius professor and head of Cambridge's school of clinical medicine. ""Once the second lockdown was put in place, we saw the number of infected students fall away to single figures,"" said Prof Maxwell. A student taking a swab sample for a Covid test Edge Hill University has reported zero positive cases from more than 2,100 students who took part in the mass testing since last week. At the University of Reading, more than 3,500 tests have been carried out for students without symptoms - finding 15 positive results, about 0.4% of tests. Students who test positive will then have further tests to confirm if they have the virus. But there have also been warnings that lateral flow tests can miss some positive cases - and it remains uncertain how many students might not have taken a test before leaving at the end of term. Portsmouth's vice chancellor said he wanted to publish the evidence to show how much infection rates had fallen among his university's students. Prof Galbraith said students should not ""bear the brunt of blame and criticism when in reality their overall behaviour has been exceptionally positive in conforming with the rules"". The university, which carried out its own Covid testing through the autumn, says that its data shows there was no link between the pattern of student infections and cases in the wider local population. There was a surge in early October in cases among students and the local Portsmouth population. But from mid-October cases among students began to fall - while cases in the local population continued to climb, with these divergent trends continuing through to mid-November, when local cases also began to reduce. The university says its own testing and tracing system had sharply reduced cases among students - and that students were unlikely to have been driving local outbreaks. Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, said the ""hard evidence"" now emerging from testing could prove that expectations about infection rates among students had been wrong. ""Like everyone else, the higher education sector has been learning about Covid as it has gone along,"" he said.

"This video can not be played Johnson: No-deal Brexit now ""very, very likely"" Boris Johnson and the EU have both warned they are unlikely to reach a post-Brexit trade deal by Sunday. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said no deal was the most probable end to ""difficult"" talks. And the UK prime minister argued the EU needed to make a ""big change"" over the main sticking points on fishing rights and business competition rules. The Sunday deadline was set by the two leaders after months of talks failed to achieve an agreement. If a trade deal is not reached and ratified by both sides by 31 December, the UK and EU could impose taxes - tariffs - on each other's goods. This could lead to higher prices, among other changes. What happens if there's no trade deal? Ex-Australia PM warns over 'Australia-style' trade What is an 'Australia-style deal'? What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? Mr Johnson chaired a meeting in Downing Street with Cabinet Officer minister Michael Gove and senior officials on Friday to carry out a ""stock-take"" of plans for a no-deal scenario, a No 10 official said. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said there was ""no sign of much genuine movement to avert no deal"". With talks continuing, the EU is determined to prevent the UK from gaining what it sees as an unfair advantage of having tariff-free access to its markets, while setting its own standards on products, employment rights and business subsidies. It is also warning that, without access to UK waters for EU fleets, UK fishermen will no longer get special access to EU markets to sell their goods. But the UK argues that what goes on in its own waters, and its wider business rules, should be under its control as a sovereign country. The two sides also disagree on whether the European Court of Justice should settle future UK-EU trade disputes. Europe's leaders are keen to clarify they won't personally intervene in the current impasse in trade talks. There'll be no last-minute handshake or ""a-ha"" moment in Paris, Warsaw or Berlin. Behind the scenes, leaders are involved in discussions with their negotiators, but they don't want to be face-to-face, or ear-to-ear, with Boris Johnson in public. EU countries are joined together in their single market. So no individual EU leader - not even the most powerful ones, in France and Germany - can be perceived to be making the political compromises that could clinch the UK deal. Concessions will have an impact on the whole single market - and therefore all member states, as a collective. Read Katya's blog in full The EU has rejected Mr Johnson's request to bypass the European Commission and speak directly to French President Emmanuel Macron and Germany's Angela Merkel about the unresolved issues. According to EU officials, he was told discussions could only take place through the bloc's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier. Speaking on a visit to a vehicle battery factory in Blyth, Northumberland, Mr Johnson said: ""We're always hopeful and... our team is still out there in Brussels. ""If there's a big offer, a big change in what they're saying, then I must say that I'm yet to see it."" If there was no deal, the situation would still be ""wonderful for the UK"", as the country could ""do exactly what we want from 1 January"", he added, even if this was ""different from what we set out to achieve"". Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are happening:The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. What happens next with Brexit? Mrs von der Leyen, who met the prime minister in Brussels on Wednesday for three hours of talks, reportedly struck a downbeat tone when she told European national leaders the ""main obstacles"" to a deal remained. She later told reporters that the two sides were still ""apart on fundamental issues"". This video can not be played EC President Ursula von der Leyen says Brexit will be ""new beginnings for old friends"" But German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas struck a more upbeat tone, saying: ""We believe finding a solution in the talks is difficult but possible."" And Ireland's Taoiseach Micheal Martin said there was room for the two sides to ""come closer"" on the major sticking points if there was the ""political will"" to do so. Earlier on Friday, UK Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden suggested UK farmers and car manufacturers would get extra financial help if the EU targeted their products with tariffs. And the EU hasset out contingency measuresit would take in the event of no trade agreement being reached with the UK. It says these would ensure UK and EU air and road connections still run after the post-Brexit transition period - under which the UK has continued to follow most of Brussels' rules - ends on 31 December. They also allow the possibility of fishing access to each other's waters for up to a year, or until an agreement is reached. SIMPLE GUIDE: What happens next with Brexit?

"This video can not be played Malcolm Turnbull: ""Be careful what you wish for"" A former Australian prime minister has warned the UK to be ""careful what you wish for"" when it comes to EU trade. Boris Johnson has told people and businesses to prepare for the ""strong possibility"" we will not agree a post-Brexit trade deal with the EU, and end up trading on ""Australian"" terms. But Malcolm Turnbull said there was no trade deal between his country and the bloc, which meant ""large barriers"". The UK and the EU have until 31 December to come to an agreement. If a deal is not struck, they will move to trading on World Trade Organisation rules - meaning tariffs or charges could be imposed on goods the UK buys and sells from and to the EU. Talks are ongoing, but Mr Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen agreed this week that a final decision on whether a deal can be reached must be made by Sunday. EU leaders told 'higher probability' of no UK deal What is an 'Australia-style deal'? What happens if there's no trade deal? The UK government has said throughout trade negotiations with the EU that it is seeking a ""Canada-style"" Free Trade Agreement, meaning tariffs would not be imposed. However, it has also said if that type of deal was not possible, it would move to an ""Australian-style relationship"" with the bloc, and the country would ""prosper"" either way. Australia is negotiating a free trade deal with the EU, but does not currently have one. It largely does business with the EU on World Trade Organisation rules, but has a few specific arrangements in place, such as co-operation on science and trade on wine - something that would not be the case for the UK if it leaves EU rules without a deal. Australia has free trade agreements with most if its geographical neighbours and does not do nearly as much trade with the EU as the UK does. Speaking on BBC Question Time, Mr Turnbull said: ""Australia has a deal with the EU on WTO terms and there are really some very large barriers to Australian trade with Europe, which we are seeking to address as we negotiate a free trade agreement with Europe ""But Australians would not regard our trade relationship with Europe as being a satisfactory one. ""There are very big barriers to Australian exports of agriculture products in particular and a lot of friction in the system in terms of services.."" Mr Turnbull is the former leader of Australia's centre-right Liberal Party and was prime minister of the country between 2015 and 2018.

"Levels of positive tests are rising in London and could be on the up in the east of England, according to data from the Office for National Statistics. Figures for the week to 5 December,external, as England's second lockdown was ending, suggest infection levels continued to fall in other regions. Infection rates are still highest in children of secondary school age, the ONS says. Across the UK, the picture is mixed, with Wales seeing rising infections. In Northern Ireland, the percentage of people testing positive continues to fall - while in Scotland it has stayed the same. The R number - or reproduction number - of the virusis now between 0.9 and 1.0 for the UK,external- slightly up from 0.8-1.0 last week. But in some regions in the south and east it could be above 1, indicating infections are likely to be growing there. The ONS figures are one source of data used by the government's scientific advisers to judge the spread of the virus, and take decisions on restrictions on people's daily lives. They are based on swab tests of thousands of people in households, whether they have symptoms or not. The estimates are thought to give a more accurate picture of how many people are infected with the virus than data on positive tests alone. Infection levels in London started to rise sharply before the end of lockdown, according to the ONS, after falling in late November. In all other regions, including the North West and North East, and Yorkshire and the Humber, the percentage of people testing positive is decreasing. But there are ""early signs"" rates may be increasing in the east of England, the ONS says. It estimates: one in 115 people have the virus in England one in 120 in Scotland one in 120 in Wales one in 235 in Northern Ireland The latest estimate of the R number for the UK is up very slightly on the previous week, but still just below 1. This means that the epidemic is still shrinking after lockdown, but very slowly. This is borne out by the latest Office for National Statistics infection survey. It indicates that cases continued to fall in most of England and Northern Ireland last week. But the view of the scientific advisory group is that the situation is ""fragile"". Cases are increasing in London and the east of England - especially among secondary school age children - and previous experience indicates that a surge among older age groups will inevitably follow. The government's scientific advisers believe that it will be important to keep infection levels as low as possible in the run-up to the holidays. That's because the relaxation of restrictions that permit families to meet over Christmas will accelerate any increase in cases - and lead to another sharp spike in infections early in the New Year. Data on cases - or confirmed positive tests - suggests areas such as Basildon, Medway and Havering in the south east are now experiencing more than 400 cases per 100,000 people. England's tiers system is due to be reviewed on 16 December and there have been suggestions that London should be moved from tier two to tier three to avoid a spike in deaths over Christmas. Kent is already in tier three while Essex is in tier two. What are the latest tiers and lockdown rules?

"Self-isolation for contacts of people with confirmed coronavirus will be shortened from 14 to 10 days across the UK from Monday. The change will also apply to people instructed to quarantine after returning from high-risk countries. And it means anyone who has been self-isolating for 10 days or more will be able to end their quarantine on Monday. The announcement comes as data shows Covid cases falling in most of England and Northern Ireland. But theOffice for National Statistics (ONS) figures showthat in the week to 5 December, there were increases in coronavirus case numbers in London and the east of England. Meanwhile, new data shows the virus's reproduction or R number is back at levels seen two weeks ago (0.9 - 1) meaning the epidemic is not growing, but it's not really shrinking either. According tothe latest government data,external, there have been a further 424 deaths within 28 days of a positive test in the UK and another 21,672 coronavirus cases. On Thursday,Health Secretary Matt Hancock announcedmass testing would be rolled out for secondary school children, their families and teachers in the worst-affected areas of London, Kent and Essex where cases are rising. The change in self-isolation rules was announced in a  statement from the four UK chief medical officers (CMOs) said: ""After reviewing the evidence, we are now confident that we can reduce the number of days that contacts self-isolate from 14 days to 10. ""People who return from countries which are not on the travel corridor list should also self-isolate for 10 days instead of 14 days."" Each of the four nations has its own lists of ""travel corridor"" countries which are exempt from the quarantine rules. While in the main, they include the same countries, they can differ slightly. The change to self-isolation ruleshas already been announced in Wales, but this new announcement will apply to all four nations. Those with symptoms or a positive test are already expected to isolate for 10 days. Covid: What is self-isolation and who has to do it? NHS Covid-19 app adds self-isolation payments Wales' Covid self-isolation period cut to 10 days Where can you get winter sun without quarantining? The CMOs added that self-isolation was ""essential to reducing the spread of Covid as it breaks the chains of transmission"". The NHS app in England will not update its 14-day counter until next Thursday. Because there will be a time-lag before it updates, anyone who has been advised to isolate by the app can leave isolation if their countdown timer hits three days between Monday and Thursday. People are most infectious around the time they first develop symptoms and, 10 days into an infection, only about 2% will still be capable of passing on the virus to others. The change in the rules reflects this low risk, which was judged not to justify asking people to self-isolate for longer periods. This video can not be played Covid symptoms: What are they and how long should I self-isolate for? Deputy Chief Medical Officer for England Dr Jenny Harries said the science was based on ""a continuous accumulation of evidence through the pandemic"". She said the ""tail end"" of an infection was the period someone was least likely to transmit infection. The latest estimate of the R number for the UK is 0.9 and 1 - up very slightly on the previous week. This means that the epidemic is still shrinking after lockdown but very slowly. This is borne out by the latest Office for National Statistics infection survey. It indicates that cases continued to fall in most of England and Northern Ireland last week. But the view of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) is that the situation is fragile. Cases are increasing in London and the East of England - especially among secondary school age children - and previous experience indicates that a surge among older age groups will inevitably follow. The government's scientific advisers believe that it will be important to keep infection levels as low as possible in the run up to the holidays. That's because the relaxation of restrictions that permit families to meet over Christmas will accelerate any increase in cases - and lead to another spike in infections early in the New Year. One study suggested that less than 20% of people fully complied with self-isolation - although it's been pointed out this doesn't distinguish between people breaking the rules slightly by going for a walk on their own, and those who ignore it entirely. Economic hardship has been identified a key factor in people not being able to isolate. But it is understood the main aim of the change was not to encourage more people to comply. Instead, the chief medical officers, say it reflects the highest-risk period, when people are most likely to be infectious. A pilot in Liverpool is looking at testing the contacts of an infected person every day for a period after exposure, and not asking them to isolate unless they test positive. This will be seen as the most attractive option as, if it doesn't increase infections, it will prevent significant numbers of people including school children from having to stay at home. But it's not thought this will be able to be rolled out until early next year, provided the results of the pilot are positive.

"This video can not be played Mark Drakeford warns Wales could go into a post-Christmas lockdown if cases do not fall A post-Christmas lockdown will come into force if Covid cases do not begin to fall, the first minister has warned. Restrictions will be relaxed for the festive period but there is pressure for tougher rules from 28 December with more than 1,900 in hospital. Mark Drakeford said that while stricter rules were not a ""foregone conclusion"" the NHS will ""not be able to cope"" if admissions continue to rise. Outdoor attractions in Wales have been told they must close from Monday. The Welsh Government said the measure includes funfairs, and venues such as trampoline parks. It means attractions such as Swansea's Museum Park Christmas event, with a big wheel, rides and games stalls, will be shutting from Saturday, say its organisers. But other events, such as Christmas shopping markets across Wales will remain open - though carousel and fun rides in these locations will also have to shut. It follows a decision toclose secondary schoolsand FE colleges from Friday;ban alcohol sales from pubs and restaurantsand close hospitality venues at 18:00. Welsh Conservatives said responsibility for the current situation rests on ""the shoulders of the Welsh Labour-led Government"". Did Wales' firebreak lockdown work? Covid patients in hospitals at highest levels yet At limit for 'telling people what to do' on Covid Next week the Welsh Government will publish a ""Covid control plan"" laying out four alert levels of restrictions that could be imposed. At the highest level - level four - restrictions would be imposed that are equivalent to a lockdown. Mr Drakeford told a press conference it would be ""inevitable"" Wales would move to level four after Christmas if the measures taken recently and ""the efforts of each and every one of us do not succeed in turning the tide of the virus"". Previous lockdowns have seen travel restrictions imposed Under the four alert levels Level One would be the closest to normality Wales is likely to have before the summer and the widespread take-up of vaccinations Level Two has ""additional, targeted controls"" possibly complemented by local restrictions to manage specific incidents Level Three would see the ""strictest package of restrictions, short of a firebreak or lockdown"" implemented Level Four would have restrictions equivalent to lockdown The first minister suggested that level four restrictions would be Wales-wide but, in future, different areas of Wales could move to different levels. He warned that any new lockdown would not be for a fixed period of time, as weth the firebreak in October and November, but would be reviewed ""on a regular cycle"" and would be extended if needed. The first minister suggested the level four restrictions, if implemented, would be Wales-wide to begin with Mr Drakeford said Wales was currently at level three. The plan, to be put to the Senedd on Tuesday for debate, would set out how it would be possible to have more than one alert level in Wales if ""some parts of Wales established themselves in a reliable... and sustainable way as having a different level of the virus"". But he said Wales was not in that position now with the situation being ""very serious"" across the whole of the country. ""In some parts of Wales, such as Neath Port Talbot, Blaenau Gwent and Rhondda Cynon Taf, the rates are now incredibly high,"" he added. Mr Drakeford also warned there could be as many as 2,500 people with coronavirus in hospitals by Christmas Day, if the increases in admissions continue. ""Our NHS will not be able to cope if we continue to see this level of coronavirus-related admissions in the coming weeks, on top of the normal winter pressures,"" he said. Under level four, Wales would see restrictions similar to the spring lockdown, with people told to stay at home but with schools and colleges and places of worship remaining open. There would be no extended household bubbles, except for single adults who could form a support bubble with one other household. No-one would be allowed to meet people outside their household or travel without a reasonable excuse. Non-essential retail would be shut, but with click and collect allowed. Public parks would be open and wedding ceremonies could take place, but receptions and wakes would not be allowed. Car dealer Nathan Griffiths says a post-Christmas lockdown would be difficult for his business In Bridgend, car dealer Nathan Griffiths wants to put 2020 behind him, and look forward to 2021. But the potential for a new lockdown after the Christmas break could dampen those hopes. ""As an employer, January is normally a really busy time for us,"" he said. ""We're even looking, if this announcement goes through, that we actually just furlough everybody and close for January."" It would hit the 100 staff they have across three sites. They had been hoping to expand the business in 2020 to a fourth site. Instead, it could now mean reducing the sites to two. ""I think the uncertainty is the hardest thing,"" he added. Andrew RT Davies, Welsh Conservative health spokesman, said: ""The First Minister's announcement today set out the bleak landscape before the people of Wales in relation to Covid infection rates and the huge pressure our NHS is under. ""Much of the responsibility for the current situation sits on the shoulders of the Welsh Labour-led Government for the poor decisions they have taken up until today. ""As Welsh Conservatives, we stand ready to work with the government here to bear down on the virus and regain control of the situation"". Plaid Cymru health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said: ""You've only got to look at the trajectory that we are on, certainly for Wales as a whole, to see that if things don't improve it's very, very likely we will need tighter restrictions."" He agreed with the idea of acting in a ""regionally sensitive way"" and said his own Ynys Mon constituency currently had low case numbers, but had seen larger outbreaks earlier in the year. ""The problem with a fully national system is you are perhaps trying to balance what's effective in areas of high prevalence with what's acceptable in areas where it's very low,"" he said.

"Self-isolation for contacts of people with confirmed coronavirus will be shortened from 14 to 10 days across the UK from Monday. The change will also apply to people instructed to quarantine after returning from high-risk countries. And it means anyone who has been self-isolating for 10 days or more will be able to end their quarantine on Monday. The announcement comes as data shows Covid cases falling in most of England and Northern Ireland. But theOffice for National Statistics (ONS) figures showthat in the week to 5 December, there were increases in coronavirus case numbers in London and the east of England. Meanwhile, new data shows the virus's reproduction or R number is back at levels seen two weeks ago (0.9 - 1) meaning the epidemic is not growing, but it's not really shrinking either. According tothe latest government data,external, there have been a further 424 deaths within 28 days of a positive test in the UK and another 21,672 coronavirus cases. On Thursday,Health Secretary Matt Hancock announcedmass testing would be rolled out for secondary school children, their families and teachers in the worst-affected areas of London, Kent and Essex where cases are rising. The change in self-isolation rules was announced in a  statement from the four UK chief medical officers (CMOs) said: ""After reviewing the evidence, we are now confident that we can reduce the number of days that contacts self-isolate from 14 days to 10. ""People who return from countries which are not on the travel corridor list should also self-isolate for 10 days instead of 14 days."" Each of the four nations has its own lists of ""travel corridor"" countries which are exempt from the quarantine rules. While in the main, they include the same countries, they can differ slightly. The change to self-isolation ruleshas already been announced in Wales, but this new announcement will apply to all four nations. Those with symptoms or a positive test are already expected to isolate for 10 days. Covid: What is self-isolation and who has to do it? NHS Covid-19 app adds self-isolation payments Wales' Covid self-isolation period cut to 10 days Where can you get winter sun without quarantining? The CMOs added that self-isolation was ""essential to reducing the spread of Covid as it breaks the chains of transmission"". The NHS app in England will not update its 14-day counter until next Thursday. Because there will be a time-lag before it updates, anyone who has been advised to isolate by the app can leave isolation if their countdown timer hits three days between Monday and Thursday. People are most infectious around the time they first develop symptoms and, 10 days into an infection, only about 2% will still be capable of passing on the virus to others. The change in the rules reflects this low risk, which was judged not to justify asking people to self-isolate for longer periods. This video can not be played Covid symptoms: What are they and how long should I self-isolate for? Deputy Chief Medical Officer for England Dr Jenny Harries said the science was based on ""a continuous accumulation of evidence through the pandemic"". She said the ""tail end"" of an infection was the period someone was least likely to transmit infection. The latest estimate of the R number for the UK is 0.9 and 1 - up very slightly on the previous week. This means that the epidemic is still shrinking after lockdown but very slowly. This is borne out by the latest Office for National Statistics infection survey. It indicates that cases continued to fall in most of England and Northern Ireland last week. But the view of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) is that the situation is fragile. Cases are increasing in London and the East of England - especially among secondary school age children - and previous experience indicates that a surge among older age groups will inevitably follow. The government's scientific advisers believe that it will be important to keep infection levels as low as possible in the run up to the holidays. That's because the relaxation of restrictions that permit families to meet over Christmas will accelerate any increase in cases - and lead to another spike in infections early in the New Year. One study suggested that less than 20% of people fully complied with self-isolation - although it's been pointed out this doesn't distinguish between people breaking the rules slightly by going for a walk on their own, and those who ignore it entirely. Economic hardship has been identified a key factor in people not being able to isolate. But it is understood the main aim of the change was not to encourage more people to comply. Instead, the chief medical officers, say it reflects the highest-risk period, when people are most likely to be infectious. A pilot in Liverpool is looking at testing the contacts of an infected person every day for a period after exposure, and not asking them to isolate unless they test positive. This will be seen as the most attractive option as, if it doesn't increase infections, it will prevent significant numbers of people including school children from having to stay at home. But it's not thought this will be able to be rolled out until early next year, provided the results of the pilot are positive.

"The global response to the Covid-19 pandemic has driven the biggest annual fall in CO2 emissions since World War Two, say researchers. Theirstudy,externalindicates that emissions have declined by around 7% this year. France and the UK saw the greatest falls, mainly due to severe shutdowns in response to a second wave of infections. China, by contrast, has seen such a large rebound from coronavirus that overall emissions may grow this year. Global 'elite' must curb high-carbon living Have countries kept their climate change promises? Beer and crisps used to help tackle climate change The decline in carbon in 2020 has dwarfed all the previous big falls. According to theGlobal Carbon Project,externalteam, this year saw carbon emissions decline by 2.4 billion tonnes. This video can not be played Is it possible to reverse the climate crisis? The BBC's Justin Rowlatt explains In contrast, the fall recorded in 2009 during the global economic recession was just half a billion tonnes, while the ending of World War Two saw emissions fall by under one billion tonnes. Across Europe and the US, the drop was around 12% over the year, but some individual countries declined by more. France saw a fall of 15% and the UK went down by 13%, according to one analysis. ""The main reason is that these two countries had two waves of confinement that were really quite severe compared with other countries,"" said Prof Corinne Le QuÃ©rÃ©, from the University of East Anglia, UK, who contributed to the study. ""The UK and France have a lot of their emissions come from the transport sector and generally have a bit less coming from industry and other sectors. ""This is even more true in France, because so much of their electricity production is from nuclear energy, so 40% of their emissions are from the transport sector."" The use of cars fell dramatically during the two national lockdowns observed in the UK The drop in emissions from aviation was still large by December Aviation around the world has been badly hit by restrictions and by the end of this year, it's expected that emissions from this sector will still be 40% below 2019 levels. One country that may have bucked the trend is China. Overall, the research team estimates that the country will experience a fall in emissions of 1.7% this year but some analysis suggests that the country has already rebounded enough from Covid-19 that the overall carbon output may have increased. ""All our datasets show that China experienced a big drop in emissions in February and March, but the datasets differ in the level of emissions towards the end of 2020,"" said Jan Ivar Korsbakken, a senior researcher atCICERO,external, who was involved in the study. ""In late 2020, China is at least close to having the same level of daily emissions as in 2019, and indeed some of our estimates suggest Chinese emissions may have actually increased for the year as a whole in 2020 relative to 2019, despite the pandemic,"" he added. Researchers believe that dramatic drop experienced through the pandemic response might be hiding a longer term fall-off in carbon, more related to climate policies. The use of coal for energy has declined over the past decade The annual growth in global CO2 emissions fell from around 3% in the early years of this century to around 0.9% in the 2010s. Much of this change was down to a move away from coal as an energy source. ""An emerging discussion pre-2020 was whether global fossil CO2 emissions were showing signs of peaking,"" said Glen Peters, research director at CICERO. ""Covid-19 has changed this narrative to one that involves avoiding a rebound in emissions and asking if emissions have already peaked,"" he said. All the researchers involved in this project agree that a rebound of emissions in 2021 is almost certain. To minimise the uptick in carbon, the scientists are urging a ""green"" rather than a ""brown"" response, meaning recovery funding should be spent on sustainable projects and not on fossil fuels. They argue that efforts should also be made to boost walking and cycling in cities and to rapidly deploy electric vehicles. Factory output has increased in China after Covid-19 and emissions are on the up While 2020's fall of over two billion tonnes of CO2 is welcome, the scientists say that meeting the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement will need cuts of up to two billion tonnes every year for the next decade. ""Although global emissions were not as high as last year, they still amounted to about 39 billion tonnes of CO2, and inevitably led to a further increase in CO2 in the atmosphere,"" said lead researcher Prof Pierre Friedlingstein from the University of Exeter, UK. ""The atmospheric CO2 level, and consequently the world's climate, will only stabilise when global CO2 emissions are near zero.""

The BBCannounced,externalit is dedicating Friday's Evening schedule on BBC One to Dame Barbara ""in loving memory"". It is showingBabsat 19:35 GMT- a dramatisation of her life story - followed by EastEnders at 21:05 GMT. Shane Richie played Alfie 2002 alongside Dame Barbara's Peggy in the soap Dame Barbara was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in 2014 and hadmoved to a care home earlier this year. She appeared in nine films in the Carry On comedy series, plus Sparrows Can't Sing, for which she was nominated for a Bafta, as well as parts in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and On the Fiddle with Sir Sean Connery. She was well-known to millions of TV viewers for her portrayal of landlady Peggy Mitchell in EastEnders, starring alongside her on-screen children Ross Kemp and Steve McFadden. This video can not be played Some of Dame Barbara Windsor's highlights as Peggy Mitchell Her last appearance in the soap came in 2016, the same year she was made a dame for her services to charity and entertainment. She also worked in theatre - making her stage debut at 13 - and appeared in productions including Oh! What A Lovely War and Fings Ain't Wot They Used To Be. The moment you met her, she had an ability to make you feel like an old friend.  She was funny, warm and engagingly open, she would arrive in a room and bring with her a little ripple of warmth. And the character you saw on TV and film was remarkably close to the person you would chat to before and after an interview.  She was from a generation of working-class actors who had got their break in the 60s when theatre directors like Joan Littlewood were looking for talent that seemed real and natural on stage and screen. That's not to say she wasn't also tough and canny enough to know how to turn on the charm.  Her life was a story filled with gangsters, set backs and determination to succeed. She had decided to act when she was a child and there was behind the laughter the sort of steel you need to have a career that lasts nearly 70 years.  There was a definitely something of her character in the tough EastEnders landlady, Peggy Mitchell. But she was always open about her ups and downs, she didn't hide the flaws and vulnerabilities, which only made her all the more likeable. After her dementia diagnosis, Dame Barbara became an ambassador for the Alzheimer's Society andmet Mr Johnson to raise awareness about the disease. The star delivered a letter signed by 100,000 people pleading for better care for people affected by dementia and saying the system was ""completely inadequate, unfair, unsustainable and in dire need of more money"". Dame Barbara Windsor married Scott Mitchell in 2000 Mr Mitchell, who campaigned alongside his wife, said of her death: ""It was not the ending that Barbara or anyone else living with this very cruel disease deserve. ""I will always be immensely proud of Barbara's courage, dignity and generosity dealing with her own illness and still trying to help others by raising awareness for as long as she could."" The couple went public with her diagnosis in 2018 and Mr Mitchell had said they had been ""really nervous"" about revealing she was affected by the condition. In his statement he thanked the public, family and friends for support which he said ""Barbara deeply appreciated"". He added: ""I've lost my wife, my best friend and soul mate and my heart or life will never feel the same without you."" The Alzheimer's Society said it was ""incredibly grateful"" to Dame Barbara and her husband for their work bringing awareness to the disease. In a statement, the charity said: ""Dame Barbara Windsor was an amazingly true, much-loved national treasure, and in speaking out about her experiences shone like a beacon for others affected by dementia."" Like her EastEnders character, Dame Barbara was born in east London, in Shoreditch in 1937. She married three times,including to small-time criminal Ronnie Knight, and she also dated gangster Charlie Kray and his brother Reggie. The actress married Mr Mitchell in 2000, with the pair having first met in 1992. If you, or someone you know, has been affected by dementia you can find more information and supporthere.

"All pupils, their families and teachers in parts of London, Kent and Essex should take a Covid test, Matt Hancock has said, as he set out a mass testing scheme for secondary schools. Extra mobile testing units will be sent out after east London and parts of Kent and Essex became some of England's major coronavirus hotspots. Cases in these areas have risen fast, especially among 11 to 18-year-olds. One London head teacher said the extra tests had been ""a long time coming"". Ges Smith, head teacher at Jo Richardson Community School in Dagenham, said he would ""strongly encourage"" his pupils to get tested but added: ""As far as I know we have got no mandate on forcing students to take that test."" Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""I urge every student, parent and teacher in these areas to step forward for testing - irrespective of whether they have symptoms. While Covid-19 may be lower risk to children and young people, it still poses a significant risk to their families and communities."" He said he wanted to keep schools and colleges open but needed to target rising infection rates. Covid tests at university find few positive cases Will there be mass testing at your child's school? London's coronavirus levels rising, ONS says Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said many parts of the country had higher infection rates than the places where the secondary school mass testing scheme was being rolled out. The government should commit to a rolling out mass testing for schools across the country, including to primary schools in areas where rates for those age groups were high. A teacher from the Midlands, who asked to remain anonymous, said he was upset at the focus on London and the south east. ""It shows clear preferential treatment when London schools get offered mass testing, yet the Midlands and the North, which have been under massive pressure for months, have never been offered this mass testing,"" he told the BBC. ""Will they (the government) now roll out mass testing to other hard-hit areas in the North and Midlands?"" He said his school had ""been under massive pressure"" since reopening, ""with close to 100 positive cases of both children and staff"". The government said all local authorities in England's top tier three of Covid restrictions had been invited to apply for a six-week community testing programme followinga mass testing trial in Liverpool. Mass testing aims to find people who might be infected but not yet displaying symptoms so they can be told to isolate. Mass Covid testing is going to become an ever bigger part of the attempt to keep schools open - and expect to see much more of it in the new year, for staff and pupils. But this latest intervention seems to be more about targeting young people in this secondary school age group, in these hotspot areas, rather than entire school year groups being screened. It's community testing with a focus on the rising infection rates among young people, rather than head teachers organising mass testing in schools. There will be 15 mobile testing units ""in or near schools"" in London, but it seems so far unlikely to be schools testing pupils in the way universities carried out mass testing of students. This will also raise questions. If there are such concerns about this age group, why not send pupils home to study online for the last few days of term -as has happened in Wales? There have been consistent warnings aboutCovid hitting attendance in schools- so why is this testing appearing now when the term is almost over? And schools in northern England, struggling for months with high levels of infections, will be irritated at the sudden urgency of efforts to prevent London moving up to tier three restrictions. There is also politics behind this. Aftera summer of U-turns, the government will do everything it can to keep schools open in England. The areas receiving extra tests for secondary schools include: The seven worst-affected London boroughs, which are Barking and Dagenham, Hackney, Havering, Newham, Redbridge, Tower Hamlets and Waltham Forest The City of London The Essex areas of Southend, Basildon, Canvey Island, Harlow and Brentwood The Kent areas of Swale, Thanet and Maidstone Mr Hancock said both PCR (a standard coronavirus test) and lateral flow testing - which takes about half an hour to show a result - would be used. In a joint statement, the Department for Education and Department of Health said an extra 15 mobile testing units would be sent out in or near schools in the capital for staff, students and their families to be tested, providing about 75,000 tests. And 44,000 home test kits will be made available for school staff to be tested before term begins in January. Covid tests for secondaries in 'concerning' areas Rising numbers of pupils sent home in England Rapid coronavirus test use defended In Essex, 10 mobile testing units will be deployed tomorrow and over the weekend, while Kent will have a further 12 mobile testing units by the start of next week. Four of the affected London boroughs were among the 20 places with the highest case rates in last week, according to Public Health England. These were Havering (400.7 cases per 100,000 people), Barking and Dagenham (333.5), Waltham Forest (327.1) and Redbridge (310.3). Some 21 of London's 32 boroughs have infection rates higher than overall rate for England of 150 cases per 100,000 people. Taken together, London's outer boroughs have an infection rate of 205 cases per 100,000. That is higher than the rate in Leicestershire, Tees Valley or Bristol, which are all under tier-three rules - the highest level - meaning people can only meet other households in outdoor public spaces such as parks, where the rule of six applies. What are the latest tiers and lockdown rules? SCHOOLS:What happens if pupils catch coronavirus? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? TEACHERS:Are they are at risk? Kent is in tier three but London and Essex are currently in tier two - meaning no household mixing is allowed indoors and the rule of six applies outdoors. Mr Hancock urged Londonersto ""stick by the rules"" this week amid fears the capital might be moved into tier threewhen the tiers are reviewed next week. About 99% of England's population are living in areas in the strictest two tiers of coronavirus rules, including more than 32 million in tier-two areas and more than 23 million in tier three. Schools in England have been given permission to close a day early for the Christmas holidaysto reduce the chances of teachers having to spend their time off speaking to contact tracersabout potential Covid cases. Meanwhile, more than 50 schools in Belfast have written to Northern Ireland's education ministerurging him to reconsider his decision not to close schools early in the run-up to Christmas. The Scottish government considered extending the Christmas school holidaysto limit the spread of the virus after families get together during the festive period - but decided against it last week. In Wales,all secondary schools and many primary schools will move classes onlinefrom Monday. Some teachers have criticised the move,saying they have had insufficient time to make arrangements.

"Shoppers in Belfast city centre on Friday Non-essential retail and some parts of the hospitality sector in Northern Ireland are now able to reopen. A two-week limited lockdown, which was imposed on 27 November, ended at 23:59 GMT on Thursday. Restaurants, cafes and other venues serving food can resume trading, however pubs that do not serve food must remain shut. Ahead of the reopening, Health Minister Robin Swann warned against a ""festive free-for-all"". On Thursday night theNI Executive's new Covid-19 regulations were published.,external The regulations, which came into force just before midnight on Thursday, provided further details on the latest rules. This video can not be played Coronavirus: 'It's good to see some atmosphere in town again' They state that any food served must have been prepared ""in a static and permanent kitchen on the premises of the bar, hotel, pub or club and which is eaten by a person seated at a table"". Reopening in Ballymena: Shops focus on survival as shutters go up once more Reopening in Londonderry: Traders have 'mixed feelings' They also outline that every person who visits hospitality must provide their name and telephone number. Other restrictions that have been lifted: Hairdressers, barbers and beauty salons can reopen but visits to them are by appointment only Churches can resume services, while weddings and funerals will have their cap of 25 people lifted- a risk assessment should be carried out to determine how many people a venue can safely accommodate Gyms can reopen for individual training but not for classes Sports training and matches can resume at all levels Up to 500 spectators can attend outdoor sporting events Households are still not allowed to mix indoors in private homes, except where strict exemptions apply. These restrictions willpartially ease on 23 December for five days over the Christmas period. A two-week limited lockdown, which was imposed on 27 November has ended Confirming the lifting of restrictions on Thursday, First Minister Arlene Foster said the reproduction (R) number, was around 1, giving the Stormont Executive the ""necessary headroom to move ahead with the planned changes"". On Thursday, another 14 coronavirus-related deaths were recorded by Northern Ireland's Department of Health, bringing the total number of deaths to 1,099. A further 441 people have also tested positive for the virus. Shoppers were out and about in Banbridge on Friday morning Mrs Foster said: ""People have to realise that personal responsibility is the key issue here. We have made provision that people can get together over Christmas, but they should do so in a safe way. ""We are keeping a very close eye on where the R number is at. We'll be looking at it again next week, and the week after to see where we're going with restrictions."" Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said the decision to lift some restrictions was ""supported by the public health team"". ""The next number of weeks are crucial,"" she said. ""If people want to have a nice Christmas with their family, don't ruin it by being reckless in the next number of weeks."" For the hospitality industry there are a number of restrictions which will still apply: All hospitality venues must close by 23:00 GMT A maximum of six people from no more than two households can be seated at a table More than six will be permitted if they all belong to a single household Food and drink are only allowed to be consumed when individuals are seated at a table Unless it is not reasonably practicable, the individuals seated at a table must be 2m away from the next table All venues will also be required to collect all customer details to help with the Test, Trace, Protect contact tracing programme Bob McCoubrey from the Mourne Seafood Bar in Belfast said he had to reduce capacity to 45% to adhere to social distancing rules and takings would be equivalent to ""a Monday in February"". ""It's a borderline decision for us and we still don't know if there's something in the legislation that will throw a spanner in the works,"" he said. ""Every week we were closed we were definitely losing money, I think our target is to try and break even and try and get the staff some hours before Christmas time."" Restaurateur Bob McCoubrey said he was frustrated that detailed guidance was not provided by the NI Executive sooner John McGirr, who owns Sally's of Omagh, has decided to stay closed over Christmas, despite running a bar that serves food. ""There's no certainty on how long were going to be open,"" he told BBC News NI. ""Our suppliers have been great with us, taking back stock that we ordered previously when we opened and closed, but this time they said they weren't taking any back. ""So there's a chance you'd be buying a lot more for Christmas and then be told, 'you're closing tomorrow'."" Sally's of Omagh said it looked forward to 2021 when it could ""provide everyone with a night out free from restrictions"" Derry publican Michael Flanagan owns a non-food bar and said even if he could reopen, he is not convinced he would. ""I think there is going to be a terrible spike [in coronavirus cases] in January. Good luck to anybody that can open, but I don't think this will work even in a pub that serves food. Progress on a vaccine too, he fears, may lead the public to ""drop their guard"". Health Minister Robin Swann said: ""We have to keep doing the basics - reducing our contacts, keeping our distance from others, wearing a face covering and washing our hands. ""Be aware of particularly risky settings - crowded indoor settings with poor ventilation where social distancing is difficult or impossible to maintain. ""If a shop, pub, cafÃ© or household falls into that category and looks too busy, walk away."" Retail NI Chief Executive Glyn Roberts has urged people to shop safely. ""This is the most important time of the year for retailers and many will want to make the ground lost over the past two weeks of the circuit-breaker,"" he said. ""Many of our town centres will have Covid Ambassadors, public hand sanitisers and business compliance signage which we hope will give reassurance to the general public."" On Tuesday the first Covid-19 vaccine in Northern Ireland wasgiven to the nurse who is heading up the vaccine roll out in Belfast.

"More than 50 schools in Belfast have written a joint letter to the education minister urging him to ""reconsider your stance on early school closure"". The letter comes from nursery, primary and post-primary schools in the West Belfast Area Learning Community (ALC). It contains a strongly-worded warning that easing many restrictions on 11 December will have a knock-on effect for schools. The schools also said that a plan is needed for January. They said ""there may be a tsunami of cases arriving in to each of our schools"" in the new year. Education Minister Peter Weirhas repeatedly stated that schools will not close early for the Christmas break. He has alsosaid that health experts have not recommended closing schools early. However some principalshave said pupils will not be marked absent if parents want them to do schoolwork at home in the final week of term. Many schools are due to end term on Friday 18 December, but some continue until 22 December. The joint letter from west Belfast schools told Mr Weir there had been a ""lack of clarity from the Department of Education, conflicting guidance from the department and Public Health Agency, and a real lack of insight from you or your department concerning the enormous volume of work which we face on a daily basis"". It said that the easing of many restrictions in other areas would have an impact on schools. ""Given that the executive has agreed to 'relax' restrictions to enable people to experience a more normal Christmas, we are fearful that this allows for increased mixing of bubbles and larger numbers of households and people being able to gather leading to increased infection rates,"" it said. Education Minister Peter Weir has repeatedly said there are no plans to close schools early for the Christmas break ""These increased risks on people's health, added pressure on NHS and likelihood of increasing mortality as a result of Covid-19 must have been judged to be tolerable in order to ensure that people are allowed to see loved ones at Christmas. ""However, failure to close schools at a time when hospitality and close-contact services resume, will undoubtedly impact on the Christmas experience of those school staff who are identified by contact tracing over the coming weeks. ""It might appear to some that whilst increasing deaths and illness rates are tolerable, safeguarding the Christmas of front-line staff such as healthcare workers and schools are not important to the executive or your department."" The letter also said that school staff had been providing constant support to pupils and parents affected by lockdown. ""Our school populations continue to grow and so, too, does the level of need and vulnerability,"" the letter said. ""We are all too aware of the 'breaking point' that some of our pupils and families have reached over the possibility of spending Christmas away from loved ones. ""This period of restrictions has been very difficult on those pupils with special educational needs, especially those suffering with Autistic Spectrum Disorder, as their ability to see loved ones from their extended family has been impacted and Christmas may be the only opportunity in the coming months."" It concludes by pleading with Mr Weir to allow school staff to teach and pupils to learn from home ""for a period of just five or six days"" before the planned end of term. ""As school leaders we also have a duty of care to our staff, pupils and the wider school community,"" it said. ""The biggest cause of stress and anxiety we see at the present time is the uncertainty people feel about their ability to see extended family over the Christmas break. ""In what has been an exceptional year for us all, can I ask that you reconsider your stance on early school closure, or at least trust in the professional judgement of school leaders to provide effective home learning opportunities which will enable the exceptionally hard working educational workforce to have the Christmas break which they have earned throughout this pandemic. ""This action, alone, has the power to do much to boost the morale and well-being of every member of staff in schools."" The government in Waleshas said all post-primary schools will move to online teaching until Christmas from Monday 14 December.

In a 2013 interview, Harrison Fordsaid it was ""perfectly appropriate"" for him to return as the adventurer. ""We've seen the character develop and grow over a period of time and it's perfectly appropriate and OK for him to come back again with a great movie around him,"" he said at the time, stressing that Indiana Jones did not have to be so action-orientated. ""To me, what was interesting about the character was that he prevailed, that he had courage, that he had wit, that he had intelligence, that he was frightened and that he still managed to survive. That I can do."" This video can not be played Harrison Ford on returning as characters Han Solo and Indiana Jones (interview from 2016) Film producer Frank Marshall recently told Den of Geekhe had no intention of replacing the actor in his iconic role,external. ""We are working on the script,"" he said. ""There will only be one Indiana Jones, and that's Harrison Ford.""

"Reynhard Sinaga (left) and Joseph McCann were both given minimum terms of 30 years Two serial rapists serving life sentences have had the minimum time they must spend in prison extended from 30 to 40 years by the Court of Appeal. Joseph McCann, 35, was jailed last year at the Old Bailey for 37 offences involving 11 women and children. Reynhard Sinaga, 37, was sentenced at Manchester Crown Court in January for 159 offences against 48 men. The judges rejected calls for whole-life jail terms, never successfully imposed in a non-homicide case. Such an order, meaning a life sentence with no minimum term, is usually reserved for certain types of murders, like those involving serial murder, child abduction or a terrorist motive. The attorney general referred McCann and Sinaga's convictions to the Court of Appeal after describing their original jail terms as ""unduly lenient"". Police now believe Sinaga committed offences against 206 men - 60 of whom remain unidentified. The failures that let Joseph McCann out of prison The sexual predator who waited outside nightclubs Serial rapist Sinaga 'abused 206 men' Five senior judges - including the Lord Chief Justice Lord Burnett and the President of the Queen's Bench Division, Dame Victoria Sharp -heard the appeal in October at the Court of Appeal in London. Their judgement,published on Friday,external, says they are ""unable to accept the submission"" that two offenders should have received a whole-life tariff. But, they add, in the ""collective experience of this court the cases of McCann and Sinaga, albeit very different on their individual facts, come within the category of the most serious cases involving a campaign of rape to have been tried in England and Wales."" The judgement then alters the minimum terms for McCann and Sinaga to 40 years each, saying the ""multiple life sentences remain and whether either is in fact ever released will depend upon the assessment of risk by the Parole Board at the end of the minimum terms"". The ruling states that ""neither man has shown any remorse and the long-term psychological damage for at least some of the victims in both trials is profound and will only be understood in the years to come"". The judgement says it endorses the line of authority that does ""not shut the door"" to a whole-life tariff in a non-murder case. Examples it gives include a ""bomb planted on a commercial airliner"" that fails to explode or intervention by the authorities that ""prevents an act of mass-murder"". The offending of McCann and Sinaga, ""does not, in our judgement, call for either to receive a whole-life tariff"", the ruling states. It adds: ""This is not to minimise the seriousness of their offending but instead to ensure that the most severe sentence in our jurisdiction is reserved, save exceptionally, either for the most serious cases involving loss of life, or when a substantive plan to murder of similar seriousness is interrupted close to fulfilment."" One 17-year-old victim says a sentence extension of 10 years ""just isn't enough"". The teenager and her 11-year-old brother were raped by McCann after he took them and their mother prisoner in their home. ""I think for me personally it's the fact that the courts don't think his crimes were serious enough for life without parole because he didn't commit murder,"" she said in a statement. ""When you're put in a position at such a young age - and not knowing whether you're going to come out of the horrific nightmare alive or dead - it has a different effect on your thoughts of everything. ""The fear of not knowing his next move or what's going to happen. It makes you think of everything differently. ""I will have to live with that fear I felt on that day for my whole life, it still haunts me. ""I was expecting him to get life, therefore I am upset and disappointed with the end decision and I think they will regret this decision in time to come."" The teenager added: ""No-one will ever understand as a victim how it feels for them knowing their offender isn't sorry for what they did, that they don't care about what they did. ""The victims don't go a day without thinking about what happened, having flash backs, nightmares and other related things."" She said McCann was not ""sorry for what he did"" and did not ""have to live the nightmare of what happened"". Girl raped by serial sex attacker 'feels failed' In a statement after the ruling, Solicitor General Michael Ellis QC said: ""Both offenders carried out some of the most heinous and depraved sexual attacks that shocked the nation. ""I am grateful for the guidance the court gave about whole-life orders and I am pleased that the court imposed a longer minimum term. ""I hope this brings some solace to the victims of these despicable crimes."" Meanwhile, Greater Manchester Police said it had identifieda further 23 people it believed were victims of Sinaga. It said it had yet to identify about 60 of the 206 victims and suspected victims. Sinaga filmed his rapes and collected so-called ""trophies"" from his drugged victims, but officers have not been able to establish the true identities of all the men. The force appealed again for anyone affected to come forward. The list of offenders with a whole-life term includes serial killers Rosemary West and Stephen Port. As of June this year there were 63 whole-life prisoners and an additional three life prisoners being treated in secure hospitals.

"This video can not be played Malcolm Turnbull: ""Be careful what you wish for"" A former Australian prime minister has warned the UK to be ""careful what you wish for"" when it comes to EU trade. Boris Johnson has told people and businesses to prepare for the ""strong possibility"" we will not agree a post-Brexit trade deal with the EU, and end up trading on ""Australian"" terms. But Malcolm Turnbull said there was no trade deal between his country and the bloc, which meant ""large barriers"". The UK and the EU have until 31 December to come to an agreement. If a deal is not struck, they will move to trading on World Trade Organisation rules - meaning tariffs or charges could be imposed on goods the UK buys and sells from and to the EU. Talks are ongoing, but Mr Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen agreed this week that a final decision on whether a deal can be reached must be made by Sunday. EU leaders told 'higher probability' of no UK deal What is an 'Australia-style deal'? What happens if there's no trade deal? The UK government has said throughout trade negotiations with the EU that it is seeking a ""Canada-style"" Free Trade Agreement, meaning tariffs would not be imposed. However, it has also said if that type of deal was not possible, it would move to an ""Australian-style relationship"" with the bloc, and the country would ""prosper"" either way. Australia is negotiating a free trade deal with the EU, but does not currently have one. It largely does business with the EU on World Trade Organisation rules, but has a few specific arrangements in place, such as co-operation on science and trade on wine - something that would not be the case for the UK if it leaves EU rules without a deal. Australia has free trade agreements with most if its geographical neighbours and does not do nearly as much trade with the EU as the UK does. Speaking on BBC Question Time, Mr Turnbull said: ""Australia has a deal with the EU on WTO terms and there are really some very large barriers to Australian trade with Europe, which we are seeking to address as we negotiate a free trade agreement with Europe ""But Australians would not regard our trade relationship with Europe as being a satisfactory one. ""There are very big barriers to Australian exports of agriculture products in particular and a lot of friction in the system in terms of services.."" Mr Turnbull is the former leader of Australia's centre-right Liberal Party and was prime minister of the country between 2015 and 2018.

One 17-year-old victim says a sentence extension of 10 years ""just isn't enough"". The teenager and her 11-year-old brother were raped by McCann after he took them and their mother prisoner in their home. ""I think for me personally it's the fact that the courts don't think his crimes were serious enough for life without parole because he didn't commit murder,"" she said in a statement. ""When you're put in a position at such a young age - and not knowing whether you're going to come out of the horrific nightmare alive or dead - it has a different effect on your thoughts of everything. ""The fear of not knowing his next move or what's going to happen. It makes you think of everything differently. ""I will have to live with that fear I felt on that day for my whole life, it still haunts me. ""I was expecting him to get life, therefore I am upset and disappointed with the end decision and I think they will regret this decision in time to come."" The teenager added: ""No-one will ever understand as a victim how it feels for them knowing their offender isn't sorry for what they did, that they don't care about what they did. ""The victims don't go a day without thinking about what happened, having flash backs, nightmares and other related things."" She said McCann was not ""sorry for what he did"" and did not ""have to live the nightmare of what happened"". Girl raped by serial sex attacker 'feels failed' In a statement after the ruling, Solicitor General Michael Ellis QC said: ""Both offenders carried out some of the most heinous and depraved sexual attacks that shocked the nation. ""I am grateful for the guidance the court gave about whole-life orders and I am pleased that the court imposed a longer minimum term. ""I hope this brings some solace to the victims of these despicable crimes."" Meanwhile, Greater Manchester Police said it had identifieda further 23 people it believed were victims of Sinaga. It said it had yet to identify about 60 of the 206 victims and suspected victims. Sinaga filmed his rapes and collected so-called ""trophies"" from his drugged victims, but officers have not been able to establish the true identities of all the men. The force appealed again for anyone affected to come forward. The list of offenders with a whole-life term includes serial killers Rosemary West and Stephen Port. As of June this year there were 63 whole-life prisoners and an additional three life prisoners being treated in secure hospitals.

"Dame Barbara Windsor, who has died at the age of 83, became the nation's favourite pin-up, the bubbly blonde who packed a lot of personality into her 4ft 10in frame. Her journey from saucy minx in the Carry On films to the matriarch of the Queen Vic in EastEnders made her a national treasure. Her teenage life was troubled. She was rejected by her father, something that drove her into a string of stormy personal relationships. But she went on to be a consummate actress who carved out a successful career on both stage and screen. Actress Dame Barbara Windsor dies aged 83 Mitchell brothers actors pay tribute In pictures: Dame Barbara Windsor Barbara Ann Deeks was born in Shoreditch, east London, on 6 August 1937, the daughter of a fruit and veg street seller and a dressmaker. Her mother Rose had great ambitions for her, paying for elocution lessons in an attempt to lose her cockney accent and move her up the social ladder. Windsor later said her mother's family felt she had married beneath her. A bright child, she sailed though her 11-plus examination. Her mother wanted her to go to university but she persuaded her otherwise by her performance in a school show. Rose spent her savings on a place for Barbara at the Aida Foster School in Golders Green. The teachers took their turn in trying to iron out her cockney accent but all failed. Barbara made her stage debut at the age of 13. Her father John walked out when she was 15 and her mother forced her to give evidence at the divorce hearing, something she never forgot. The unhappiness of her home life drove her to seek solace in a string of casual relationships, which led to her having three abortions by the time she was 21. She had changed her name to Windsor when she appeared in her first film in 1954, as one of the schoolgirls in The Belles of St Trinian's. Her big break came when she joined Joan Littlewood's company at the Theatre Royal in Stratford, east London, appearing in the musical Fings Ain't Wot They Used To Be. Her role as Maggie Gooding in Littlewood's 1963 film Sparrers Can't Sing gained her a Bafta nomination. There were also early roles in TV sitcoms including the BBC's The Rag Trade, which ran for two years from 1961. Windsor (right) with the cast of The Rag Trade in 1962 East End social life saw showbusiness intermingling with local gang culture, and Windsor became friends with the Kray twins and their entourage. She dated Charlie Kray for six months - ""the most perfect gentleman I have ever known"" - and also had a brief relationship with his brother Reggie. With husband Ronnie Knight (left) and Reggie Kray In 1964, she married a small-time criminal, Ronnie Knight, beginning a sometimes stormy union that would last more than 20 years. In the same year, she was cast in Carry On Spying, the ninth film in the successful comedy franchise and the last to be shot in black and white. Her saucy laugh and flirtatious behaviour were perfect for the seaside postcard innuendo on which the success of the films was based. Barbara Windsor as a nurse in Carry On Doctor (1967) But she was adamant that beneath the on-screen character was a serious actress. ""I am not like my image,"" she once said. ""Everyone thinks I just bounce in, but I study and everything has to be just right."" Although she appeared in only a third of the Carry On series, they defined her career and later made it difficult to escape the inevitable typecasting. Arguably her most memorable appearance was in Carry On Camping, when her bikini top flew off during some strenuous physical exercise. The scene had to be shot three times, with the garment being removed by the deft use of a fishing rod in the hands of an off-screen assistant. Barbara had a 10-year affair with Carry On co-star Sid James During her Carry On career she had a 10-year affair with co-star Sid James, which ended just before the actor's death in 1976. It was later portrayed in the ITV drama Cor Blimey!, on which Windsor acted as an advisor. At first, she fended him off, but his infatuation continued. ""I cared deeply for him,"" she recalled. ""I didn't at first, he was just my leading man and I used to push him off. But he was an old-fashioned charmer, opening doors and all the rest of it, making you feel like a lady. So our relationship was inevitable."" In between the Carry On films she continued her stage career, receiving a Tony Award nomination for the Broadway production of Oh! What A Lovely War. She also starred as the music hall performer Marie Lloyd in the biopic Sing a Rude Song, a role she reprised in the BBC series The Good Old Days. In the mid-1970s she toured with her own show, Carry On Barbara, and appeared as Maria in Twelfth Night at Chichester Festival Theatre. But, as she reached her 40s, the image of the bubbly blonde with the sexy wiggle was hampering her ability to get work. ""I found myself in the doldrums in the early 90s. I was too old to play the dolly bird any longer and I looked too young to play a woman of my real age."" She did get the part of the raunchy landlady in a stage production of Joe Orton's black comedy Entertaining Mr Sloane, which was directed by her Carry On co-star Kenneth Williams. Her marriage to Ronnie was coming to an end, after he fled to Spain following his involvement in a multi-million-pound robbery from a security company. In 1994, Dame Barbara was introduced to Albert Square as Peggy Mitchell, mother to Phil (right) and Grant Her career received a major boost in 1994 when she was chosen to play brassy landlady Peggy Mitchell in the BBC soap EastEnders. Ironically, she had spent some of the previous few years pulling pints in a pub in Buckinghamshire that she owned with her second husband, Stephen Hollings. She admitted she had found the idea of EastEnders daunting, joining what was an already well-established drama. ""I was as scared starting on EastEnders as I was when I first stepped on to the Carry On set,"" she later recalled. ""I had to prove myself in a different world."" She based the character of Peggy on Violet Kray, the matriarch of the gang family she had known so well in her youth. On set she found herself acting as a mother figure to many of the soap's young actors, some of whom had no formal training in drama. And at the age of 70, she told one interviewer that she still got a thrill from being wolf-whistled in the street - and made sure she put an extra wiggle in her walk when it happened. A royal visit to the Queen Vic She was forced out of the soap for two years after contracting the debilitating Epstein-Barr virus at the end of 2002, which left her bedridden. There was a brief return in 2004, but she was not well enough to resume the role full-time until the following year. Shortly after picking up a lifetime achievement award at the British Soap Awards, she announced she was quitting EastEnders to spend more time with her third husband, Scott Mitchell. ""I'll be so sad to leave Peggy behind,"" she said at the time. ""She's such a wonderful character to play."" There was also a problem that she withheld from her fans. She had begun finding it hard to learn her lines and she kept repeating certain sentences and stories. After a series of mental agility tests and a brain scan, she was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in 2014. ""I'm so sorry,"" she mouthed to her husband. Two years later she filmed her final scenes as Peggy Mitchell. EastEnders were reluctant to kill off such an iconic character but she rang the producers to insist. In 2009, she was presented with a lifetime achievement award at the British Soap Awards Her husband Scott went to see them to make sure they understood this really was the end. ""Look into my eyes,"" he said. ""She is not coming back."" On set they had an autocue ready but she did not need it. Peggy Mitchell, terminally ill with breast cancer, took a lethal overdose of pills and died in her sleep. In the 2016 New Year's Honours, Barbara was made a dame for her services to charity and entertainment. But soon afterwards, Dame Barbara's Alzheimer's became more difficult to hide. By the time she turned 80 in August 2017, a continual confusion had set in. She became more and more housebound, upset at having to keep her secret from the fans who flocked to her whenever she set foot outside. In May 2018,she made the decision to go public with her conditionand was still well enough to feel overwhelmed by the warmth of the public reaction. Dame Barbara may have retreated from the public gaze but around her friends and family took on the role of campaigning and fundraising for dementia care in her honour. Adam Woodyatt and Jake Wood were among several EastEnders stars who ran the London Marathon in 2019 in a team called Barbara's Revolutionaries. ""It means so much to me to see some of my closest friends coming together to support this cause,"" Dame Barbara said. ""I know it will mean a lot to everyone else living with dementia."" Later that year Dame Barbara put her name to an open letter with her husband calling on the prime minister for a ""long-term funding solution to end the social care crisis"". It coincided with the couple's appointment as ambassadors for the Alzheimer's Society. In July 2020, Dame Barbara's husband had to make the difficult decision to move her into a care home as her condition deteriorated during the coronavirus lockdown. Both on and off-screen Dame Barbara will be remembered as the ""sex-pot with a heart of gold, navigating a complicated and sometimes tumultuous private life"". She enjoyed her successes, faced life's challenges bravely and found happiness in her final marriage to Scott. She was a formidable character actress with a place in British hearts for more than half a century.  And like many of the characters she played, Barbara Windsor was sometimes down, but never out.

"This video can not be played Malcolm Turnbull: ""Be careful what you wish for"" A former Australian prime minister has warned the UK to be ""careful what you wish for"" when it comes to EU trade. Boris Johnson has told people and businesses to prepare for the ""strong possibility"" we will not agree a post-Brexit trade deal with the EU, and end up trading on ""Australian"" terms. But Malcolm Turnbull said there was no trade deal between his country and the bloc, which meant ""large barriers"". The UK and the EU have until 31 December to come to an agreement. If a deal is not struck, they will move to trading on World Trade Organisation rules - meaning tariffs or charges could be imposed on goods the UK buys and sells from and to the EU. Talks are ongoing, but Mr Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen agreed this week that a final decision on whether a deal can be reached must be made by Sunday. EU leaders told 'higher probability' of no UK deal What is an 'Australia-style deal'? What happens if there's no trade deal? The UK government has said throughout trade negotiations with the EU that it is seeking a ""Canada-style"" Free Trade Agreement, meaning tariffs would not be imposed. However, it has also said if that type of deal was not possible, it would move to an ""Australian-style relationship"" with the bloc, and the country would ""prosper"" either way. Australia is negotiating a free trade deal with the EU, but does not currently have one. It largely does business with the EU on World Trade Organisation rules, but has a few specific arrangements in place, such as co-operation on science and trade on wine - something that would not be the case for the UK if it leaves EU rules without a deal. Australia has free trade agreements with most if its geographical neighbours and does not do nearly as much trade with the EU as the UK does. Speaking on BBC Question Time, Mr Turnbull said: ""Australia has a deal with the EU on WTO terms and there are really some very large barriers to Australian trade with Europe, which we are seeking to address as we negotiate a free trade agreement with Europe ""But Australians would not regard our trade relationship with Europe as being a satisfactory one. ""There are very big barriers to Australian exports of agriculture products in particular and a lot of friction in the system in terms of services.."" Mr Turnbull is the former leader of Australia's centre-right Liberal Party and was prime minister of the country between 2015 and 2018.

The BBCannounced,externalit is dedicating Friday's Evening schedule on BBC One to Dame Barbara ""in loving memory"". It is showingBabsat 19:35 GMT- a dramatisation of her life story - followed by EastEnders at 21:05 GMT. Shane Richie played Alfie 2002 alongside Dame Barbara's Peggy in the soap Dame Barbara was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in 2014 and hadmoved to a care home earlier this year. She appeared in nine films in the Carry On comedy series, plus Sparrows Can't Sing, for which she was nominated for a Bafta, as well as parts in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and On the Fiddle with Sir Sean Connery. She was well-known to millions of TV viewers for her portrayal of landlady Peggy Mitchell in EastEnders, starring alongside her on-screen children Ross Kemp and Steve McFadden. This video can not be played Some of Dame Barbara Windsor's highlights as Peggy Mitchell Her last appearance in the soap came in 2016, the same year she was made a dame for her services to charity and entertainment. She also worked in theatre - making her stage debut at 13 - and appeared in productions including Oh! What A Lovely War and Fings Ain't Wot They Used To Be. The moment you met her, she had an ability to make you feel like an old friend.  She was funny, warm and engagingly open, she would arrive in a room and bring with her a little ripple of warmth. And the character you saw on TV and film was remarkably close to the person you would chat to before and after an interview.  She was from a generation of working-class actors who had got their break in the 60s when theatre directors like Joan Littlewood were looking for talent that seemed real and natural on stage and screen. That's not to say she wasn't also tough and canny enough to know how to turn on the charm.  Her life was a story filled with gangsters, set backs and determination to succeed. She had decided to act when she was a child and there was behind the laughter the sort of steel you need to have a career that lasts nearly 70 years.  There was a definitely something of her character in the tough EastEnders landlady, Peggy Mitchell. But she was always open about her ups and downs, she didn't hide the flaws and vulnerabilities, which only made her all the more likeable. After her dementia diagnosis, Dame Barbara became an ambassador for the Alzheimer's Society andmet Mr Johnson to raise awareness about the disease. The star delivered a letter signed by 100,000 people pleading for better care for people affected by dementia and saying the system was ""completely inadequate, unfair, unsustainable and in dire need of more money"". Dame Barbara Windsor married Scott Mitchell in 2000 Mr Mitchell, who campaigned alongside his wife, said of her death: ""It was not the ending that Barbara or anyone else living with this very cruel disease deserve. ""I will always be immensely proud of Barbara's courage, dignity and generosity dealing with her own illness and still trying to help others by raising awareness for as long as she could."" The couple went public with her diagnosis in 2018 and Mr Mitchell had said they had been ""really nervous"" about revealing she was affected by the condition. In his statement he thanked the public, family and friends for support which he said ""Barbara deeply appreciated"". He added: ""I've lost my wife, my best friend and soul mate and my heart or life will never feel the same without you."" The Alzheimer's Society said it was ""incredibly grateful"" to Dame Barbara and her husband for their work bringing awareness to the disease. In a statement, the charity said: ""Dame Barbara Windsor was an amazingly true, much-loved national treasure, and in speaking out about her experiences shone like a beacon for others affected by dementia."" Like her EastEnders character, Dame Barbara was born in east London, in Shoreditch in 1937. She married three times,including to small-time criminal Ronnie Knight, and she also dated gangster Charlie Kray and his brother Reggie. The actress married Mr Mitchell in 2000, with the pair having first met in 1992. If you, or someone you know, has been affected by dementia you can find more information and supporthere.

"UK banks are well prepared for serious economic shocks and can continue to lend during the pandemic, the Bank of England has said. Banks have built up strong capital buffers since the financial crisis more than a decade ago, the Bank said inits latest financial stability report,external. Most risks to the UK's financial stability posed by a no-deal Brexit have been mitigated, it said. But it warned that ""some disruption to financial services could arise"". Businesses, with the support of government guarantees, have borrowed Â£80bn so far this year, compared with Â£20bn by this time last year, according to the Bank. It said the major UK banks could absorb credit losses in the order of Â£200bn, but that would involve ""incredibly severe"" shocks that were unlikely to occur. For instance, unemployment would have to rise to 15% and house prices to fall by 30%. UK growth slows again in October as rebound stalls UK unemployment rate continues to surge Former Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee member Andrew Sentance told the BBC that the Bank saw the banking system as ""very resilient"". ""I think that the Bank's assessment makes sense,"" he said. However, he warned that outside the financial system, a no-deal Brexit would pose big challenges. ""The real economy is going to struggle if we go into a Brexit no-deal,"" he added. ""Financial sector preparations for the end of the transition period with the EU are now in their final stages,"" the Bank's report said. ""Most risks to UK financial stability that could arise from disruption to the provision of cross-border financial services at the end of the transition period have been mitigated."" However, it added: ""Financial stability is not the same as market stability or the avoidance of any disruption to users of financial services. Some market volatility and disruption to financial services, particularly to EU-based clients, could arise."" The Bank said financial institutions should continue taking measures to minimise disruption. On the housing market, the Bank noted that activity had picked up sharply in recent months, but the number of advertised mortgage products had continued to fall and was ""materially lower"" than earlier in the year. ""While some lenders have reintroduced products since the early stages of the pandemic, others have withdrawn further, especially at higher [loan-to-value] ratios,"" it said. The Bank said it was important to prevent a rapid build-up of mortgage debt, which it said had ""historically been an important source of risk to financial and economic stability"". To that end, the Bank's Financial Policy Committee had recommended limiting the proportion of new mortgages with high loan to income ratios, guarding against an increase in the number of highly indebted households.

The BBCannounced,externalit is dedicating Friday's Evening schedule on BBC One to Dame Barbara ""in loving memory"". It is showingBabsat 19:35 GMT- a dramatisation of her life story - followed by EastEnders at 21:05 GMT. Shane Richie played Alfie 2002 alongside Dame Barbara's Peggy in the soap Dame Barbara was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in 2014 and hadmoved to a care home earlier this year. She appeared in nine films in the Carry On comedy series, plus Sparrows Can't Sing, for which she was nominated for a Bafta, as well as parts in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and On the Fiddle with Sir Sean Connery. She was well-known to millions of TV viewers for her portrayal of landlady Peggy Mitchell in EastEnders, starring alongside her on-screen children Ross Kemp and Steve McFadden. This video can not be played Some of Dame Barbara Windsor's highlights as Peggy Mitchell Her last appearance in the soap came in 2016, the same year she was made a dame for her services to charity and entertainment. She also worked in theatre - making her stage debut at 13 - and appeared in productions including Oh! What A Lovely War and Fings Ain't Wot They Used To Be. The moment you met her, she had an ability to make you feel like an old friend.  She was funny, warm and engagingly open, she would arrive in a room and bring with her a little ripple of warmth. And the character you saw on TV and film was remarkably close to the person you would chat to before and after an interview.  She was from a generation of working-class actors who had got their break in the 60s when theatre directors like Joan Littlewood were looking for talent that seemed real and natural on stage and screen. That's not to say she wasn't also tough and canny enough to know how to turn on the charm.  Her life was a story filled with gangsters, set backs and determination to succeed. She had decided to act when she was a child and there was behind the laughter the sort of steel you need to have a career that lasts nearly 70 years.  There was a definitely something of her character in the tough EastEnders landlady, Peggy Mitchell. But she was always open about her ups and downs, she didn't hide the flaws and vulnerabilities, which only made her all the more likeable. After her dementia diagnosis, Dame Barbara became an ambassador for the Alzheimer's Society andmet Mr Johnson to raise awareness about the disease. The star delivered a letter signed by 100,000 people pleading for better care for people affected by dementia and saying the system was ""completely inadequate, unfair, unsustainable and in dire need of more money"". Dame Barbara Windsor married Scott Mitchell in 2000 Mr Mitchell, who campaigned alongside his wife, said of her death: ""It was not the ending that Barbara or anyone else living with this very cruel disease deserve. ""I will always be immensely proud of Barbara's courage, dignity and generosity dealing with her own illness and still trying to help others by raising awareness for as long as she could."" The couple went public with her diagnosis in 2018 and Mr Mitchell had said they had been ""really nervous"" about revealing she was affected by the condition. In his statement he thanked the public, family and friends for support which he said ""Barbara deeply appreciated"". He added: ""I've lost my wife, my best friend and soul mate and my heart or life will never feel the same without you."" The Alzheimer's Society said it was ""incredibly grateful"" to Dame Barbara and her husband for their work bringing awareness to the disease. In a statement, the charity said: ""Dame Barbara Windsor was an amazingly true, much-loved national treasure, and in speaking out about her experiences shone like a beacon for others affected by dementia."" Like her EastEnders character, Dame Barbara was born in east London, in Shoreditch in 1937. She married three times,including to small-time criminal Ronnie Knight, and she also dated gangster Charlie Kray and his brother Reggie. The actress married Mr Mitchell in 2000, with the pair having first met in 1992. If you, or someone you know, has been affected by dementia you can find more information and supporthere.

"Teaching will move online from Monday in Wales Wales' secondary school system ""must reinvent itself in a day again"", a headmaster has said. Ian Loynd, of St Teilo's in Cardiff was respondingto Thursday's announcement all secondary schoolsand colleges would move work online from Monday. He said it gave parents and carers insufficient time to make arrangements. Parent Clare Ferguson-Walker said it was ""the right decision"", claiming schools were unable to manage social distancing. Meanwhile ColegauCymru, which represents further education colleges in Wales, said learning would remain online for the first week of 2021, from 4-8 January, with students returning to the classroom on 11 January. The majority of Wales' councils have also said their primary schools will be closing early before the Christmas break, with learning moved online and classes only open for vulnerable children and those of key workers. ""It's always a rapidly changing position and the news came late,"" Mr Loynd toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfast. ""Heads had been asking (about the possibility of an early closure) for a number of weeks."" But despite questioning the fact there was only one working day's notice, Mr Loynd agreed it was ""the right decision"". Secondary schools 'move online' from Monday Christmas fears sees parents pull children from school He said it came down to a choice between the inevitable ""families voting with their feet"" and keeping children home, or changing teaching in a ""calm and controlled way"", as he believes it will be by Monday. Mr Loynd pointed to the earlier lockdown as giving teachers experience of managing homeworking, adding: ""I can only hope we are open in the new year as planned, but we will have to see as the position changes. ""My view is the best place for children is the classroom, but it has to be safe."" He said his school had been tracking more than 30 coronavirus cases a day, with almost 500 in total since the start of the pandemic and 33 positive involving children. ""In 16 years as a teacher, this is the hardest I've faced. But 99.5% of teaching has still been face-to-face,"" he said. ""Just 0.5% has been lost. So while it's been difficult, it's working."" Several local authorities had already announced they would shut schools early Students at St Teilo's Church in Wales High School in Cardiff have been giving their views - and they are less than impressed. ""I'm a bit like gutted, as I'd rather go to school, because I don't like working from home. But it is what it is - and I'm still learning,"" said one male pupil. Another female pupil added: ""They could have just told us (earlier) so we were more prepared. ""We could have done our work more in the time of school and got it all done rather than being told the day before and being stressed about doing the online lessons, and feeling like we don't have the resources we have in school and stuff, and having limited contact with our teachers."" This sixth-form A-level student at the school said he was becoming increasingly frustrated: ""Our education has already been disturbed enough with the previous lockdowns. I feel as though it is taking away from our education. ""I really feel they are mixing up my education, which I'm not really a fan of. I don't really know what is going on. It's quite scary really."" In numbers, since September 3,032cases among pupils 2,127cases in staff 1,573schools with at least one case 861cases in the most recent six days 10schools have had more than 20 cases Clare Ferguson-Walker, from Tavernspite, Pembrokeshire, said she has one son in year eight and another child who is home educated, and that she was ""really glad"" the decision had been made. ""I'm surprised it didn't happen before this,"" she said. ""They haven't been able to properly police social distancing and my son has been coming home telling me who he's been wrestling with."" While she understands it will be hard for some parents, she added: ""I'll get the tree up this weekend and make it as magical as possible."" Wales' Education Minister Kirsty Williams said on Thursday closures were part of a ""national effort to reduce transmission of coronavirus"". ""Every day, we are seeing more and more people admitted to hospital with coronavirus symptoms,"" she said. ""The virus is putting our health service under significant and sustained pressure and it is important we all make a contribution to reduce its transmission."" The announcement does not extend to primary or special schools, with the education minister ""encouraging"" them to remain open. However, a number of local authorities have announced they will also be halting face-to-face learning in primaries early. The Children's Commissioner for Wales Sally Holland says she does not support closing schools early But Children's Commissioner Sally Holland said the move was ""not the right decision"" for children and young people in Wales and had yet to see any scientific advice to support the move. ""Whilst accepting the severity of the public health emergency and the responsibilities all of us have to keep each other safe, this decision compounds the disruption to our children's education over the last few months,"" she said. Ms Holland said her ""hope and expectation"" was schools would reopen in January. ""It's hard to get it right, but you have to look at it from the perspective of children who have missed so much,"" she added. After repeatedly resisting calls to move to online learning, the government's decision came at the eleventh hour. Even many of those that welcomed it raise concerns about the fact teachers and families have only a day of school time left to address the changed situation they face next week. It has been presented as offering ""clear, national direction"" but the announcement sparked a flurry of different local announcements cutting short face-to-face teaching in primary schools too. The education minister said her decision was driven by the latest advice by the chief medical officer, while accepting that young people have paid a heavy price during this pandemic. This is another week out of school, with the possibility of further disruption to the start of next term. From Monday, 14 December:Swansea From Tuesday, 15 December:Anglesey, Ceredigion, Carmarthenshire, Merthyr Tydfil, Neath Port Talbot, Powys and Pembrokeshire From Wednesday, 16 December: Cardiff, Denbighshire, Blaenau Gwent, Bridgend, Caerphilly, Rhondda Cynon Taf, Vale of Glamorgan From Thursday, 17 December:Gwynedd, Monmouthshire and Newport Schools in some council areas will remain open for children of key workers and for vulnerable children.

"The fire broke out in the three-storey house in St Neots on Thursday morning A three-year-old boy and seven-year-old girl have died in a fire at a house. The children died at the scene of the blaze in St Neots, Cambridgeshire, on Thursday morning, police said. Their 35-year-old mother suffered life-changing injuries from jumping from a second-floor window, while her partner, a 46-year-old man, had minor injuries. Firefighters described how they were told the children were still in the burning house when they arrived and they tried to get them out. An investigation into the fire has concluded the most probable cause was an electrical fault in a first-floor bedroom. There were no suspicious circumstances, Cambridgeshire Police said. Smoke was seen billowing from the house on Thursday About 40 firefighters were sent to tackle the blaze, at the home in Buttercup Avenue, Eynesbury. Floral tributes and soft toys have been left under a tree near the house. A message on a teddy bear said: ""We have no words. So heartbroken. Hope you are all in a better place. XXX."" One card reads: ""Dear darling angels, keep holding each other's hands. You are so loved."" Police, the ambulance service and an air ambulance were also sent to the scene Neighbour Charles Cooper, 30, said: ""The flames went up fairly swiftly. By the time my wife and I woke up, the firefighters had already arrived. ""It took a good three or four hours before the smoke abated. The flames were coming out of the top window."" He said he did not know the family to speak to but said ""we would give them a wave"". About 40 firefighters tackled the blaze Peter Kellythorn, 40, said there was a smell ""like something might be smouldering"" when he awoke on Thursday. ""I got dressed, came outside and there was smoke billowing out from the back window,"" he said. He added they were ""fairly new houses"" and said of the fire: ""It's just awful."" Members of Cambridgeshire Fire and Rescue Service laid flowers at the scene Tributes have been left under a tree to the front of the house Chief Fire Officer Chris Strickland said: ""Crews fought tirelessly to get the fire under control and locate the children, who they had been told were still in the house. ""It's one of the toughest incidents you can attend as a firefighter and we're looking after the crews who were there. ""But all of our thoughts are very much with the family and the local community and we'll be in the area over the coming days providing support to residents.""

"The Westway Trust was part of the ""collective response"" in aftermath of the Grenfell fire in 2017 A west London charity that supported Grenfell Tower fire victims has been and remains institutionally racist, a review has found. The Westway Trust, which manages land under the Westway road for the local community, commissioned a review in 2018 over allegations of racism. The review found the trust had a ""legacy of institutional racism"" and should make a formal public apology. The charity said it apologised ""to our entire community"". The Westway Trust was created nearly 50 years ago to manage the 23 acres (9.3 hectares) of space under the elevated trunk road in west London. According to the charity's website, it was part of the ""collective response"" in the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower fire, which killed 72 people. The organisation commissioned the review after acknowledging ""serious"" allegations of institutional racism had been made over several decades. The trust was created nearly 50 years ago to manage the land around the Westway The report by the Tutu Foundation, an organisation that provides mediation services, found that, given all the evidence, the trust ""has been and remains institutionally racist"". ""The legacy of institutional racism lives within the organisation in terms of the perceptions and relations with the African Caribbean community, which has led to a continuing mistrust. ""The trust has failed to understand, identify and address racial disparity in terms of key functions including in relation to service delivery and employment,"" the review said. It added the charity had ""lost sight of the reason for its establishment and early focus on community and inclusivity"", while anyone who had ""sounded the alarm"" about issues over the years had been ignored or silenced. The review recommended a ""reparatory justice approach"" should be taken by the charity, which could include the offer of compensation to affected communities. It also recommended the creation of a centre for civil rights and culture, which it said could be ""a way for the rich history of the area to be preserved and curated for future generations"". The trust said it accepted the report's recommendations, adding that it wanted to be ""a truly inclusive organisation that is a beacon of good practice"".

"Australia will maintain its Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine orders but cancel another type A promising Australian candidate for a coronavirus vaccine has been abandoned after trial participants returned false HIV positive results. Australia had previously agreed to buy 51 million doses of the vaccine being developed by Australian firm CSL and the University of Queensland (UQ). The government said orders of other vaccines would now fill the shortfall. CSL and UQ stressed that the positive results were false - meaning trial participants' health was not at risk. The Australian government said it had now entered an agreement for the Novavax vaccine, and upped its existing order of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine. The UK was the first to begin rolling out a vaccine from Pfizer this week. First person receives Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine The vaccine had been in stage one of trials, and proving to be effective in making antibodies. But it also generated HIV antibodies in some recipients - which meant it showed false positives for HIV. Further testing proved the HIV wasn't there. CSL and UQ said fixing the flaw would take about a year, prompting a decision to abandon the trial. ""It was likely to work. But we knew that we didn't want to have any issues with confidence, and this false-positive test may have caused some confusion and lack of confidence,"" said Brendan Murphy, secretary of Australia's Department of Health. More about the vaccines: How will I get a coronavirus vaccine? Who will get the vaccine first and when can you have it? Your Questions Answered: How do we know the vaccine is safe? Two full doses of the Oxford vaccine gave 62% protection, a half dose followed by a full dose was 90% and overall the trial showed 70% protection. Vaccine co-lead Paul Young described the decision as ""devastating"" after 11 months of ""living and breathing this project"". ""While this is a tough decision to take, the urgent need for a vaccine has to be everyone's priority,"" he said. Other medical experts have also praised the ""realistic"" decision to abandon the UQ vaccine, saying it reflects the reality of vaccine development. ""In general, about 90% of vaccines never make it to market. As a global community, we have been spoilt with the unprecedented swiftness and success with which the development of Covid-19 vaccines have taken place,"" said infectious diseases expert Sanjaya Senanayake from the Australian National University. Australia has all but eliminated community transmission of the virus, after getting on top of outbreaks in recent months. Prof Murphy said the nation was in a ""wonderful position"" at present, but there would be ""full population coverage"" from two vaccines in 2021. ""We don't need emergency approval - we're in a good position because we've controlled the virus,"" he said on Friday. ""So I'm very confident about the successful vaccination strategy that we'll be facing next year."" The government said it had prepared for this sort of situation and as such had ""spread the risk"" with multiple deals for vaccines. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said focusing Australia's manufacturing efforts on the other vaccines would mean ""we are more likely to have the entire population vaccinated earlier rather than later"". The Oxford vaccine has been found to be ""safe and effective"", according to researchers, but is awaiting approval from regulators around the world. Early 2021 is still listed as when the first vaccines - most likely from Oxford/AstraZeneca - are scheduled to be given to Australians. Australia has a population of 25 million people. It recorded just one case of local transmission in the past week. The nation has reported 908 deaths and 28,000 cases so far during the pandemic - far fewer than many nations. It has been praised for responding quickly to the pandemic with border shutdowns, lockdown measures and aggressive contract-tracing efforts. Some failures, however, have been blamed for deaths.

Our live coverage of the pandemic will be back on Monday morning. We're getting ready to wrap up for the day, and for the weekend. Here's what you need to know about the pandemic in the UK before we do: Ski resorts in Spain have announced that they will be opening ahead
of the Christmas break despite concerns among European countries about the possible spread of infections. Many resorts have delayed their opening due to the pandemic, but resorts
in Catalonia are set to open on Monday 14 November, according to AFP news agency. Special measures are in place in Spain's resorts, such asreduced
capacity on lifts and in restaurants and bars.,external Other countries such as France, Germany and Italy will keep its
resorts closed over the Christmas period. Italy, supported by Germany, wanted a European agreement to close
all ski resorts over the holiday. However, ski resorts in countries including
Spain, Switzerland and Austriaall released plans to
open. Warner Bros will release its live action Tom and Jerry both online and in cinemas The company that owns the UK's Odeon Cinemas has secured $100m (Â£76m) in emergency funds amid concerns about Covid-19 - but warned the money will only help it through another month. AMC Entertainment Holdings, the world's largest movie theatre operator, said attendance has dropped 92% in the US and 86% internationally. The pandemic has meant that some cinemas have shut and audiences have stayed away. The company is burning through $125m a month. ""Our current cash burn rates are not sustainable,"" it said. Even once cinemas reopened this year, it said the growth of streaming posed a challenge. Warner Bros this month said it planned to release all of its 2021 films online on the same day they are released to cinemas. They will air on the HBO Max streaming service, with which it shares a parent company. Disney has also said it plans to push more of its films to its Disney+ streaming service.

South Africa's top judge says he is unconcerned about criticism after a video showing him falsely suggesting that Covid-19 vaccines could alter people's DNA and insert satanic elements within them was widely shared online. Speaking to the media on Friday, Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng said he expected a backlash for the comments he made on Thursday at a prayer event. He told reporters that he was concerned about a report he saw that suggested that the Covid-19 vaccine would be mandatory. ""It must be voluntary... You can't impose a vaccine on people. Why should you?""news site EWN quotes the judge as saying.,external His opinion on Covid-19 vaccines has divided South Africans. There have been concerns that rich countries may be buying up most of the newly developed vaccines, not leaving enough for countries in Africa, although both Nigeria and Uganda have said they have ordered millions of doses. A study of coronavirus patients in intensive care has found that
some people become more susceptible to severe Covid-19 symptoms than others. Scientists looked into the DNA of more than 2,200 patients in UK
hospitals. They looked at each personâs genes, which contain the instructions
for every biological process â including how to fight a virus. Their genomes were then compared with those of healthy people to
pinpoint any genetic differences. The findings shed light on where the immune system goes wrong,
which could help identify new treatments. You can read

Speaking at the Welsh Government's press conference, Mark Drakeford said while stricter rules were not a ""foregone conclusion"", the NHS will ""not be able to cope"" if admissions continue to rise. Next week the Welsh Government will publish a ""Covid control plan"", laying out four alert levels of restrictions that could be imposed. Read more about the rules in Wales here. About 2,000 troops were deployed to Liverpool in November Army regiments that helped set up and run a mass coronavirus testing pilot in Liverpool are to be given the Freedom of the City - the city's the highest civic honour. Around 2,000 troops were deployed to Liverpool in November, where they helped carry out 200,000 tests at almost 50 centres. The city's coronavirus infection rates have since dropped from 680 cases per 100,000 people to fewer than 100. It enabled the city region to move down from tier three to tier two when the national lockdown ended. Brigadier Joe Fossey, commander of the 8th Engineer Brigade, which led the operation, said he was ""extremely proud of what we have all achieved in such a short time and how warmly we have been received by all those in the city"". ""To receive Liverpool's highest civic honour crowns an extraordinary six weeks for all of us and marks an important moment in the continuing fight against Covid-19,"" he added. Read full story here.

But the bus driver took a detour to get her there on time, saying it was ""just the right thing to do"". Alec Bailey told his other passengers he would take a detour to get her as close to the home as possible.

In projections released on Friday, the agency predicts at
least 90,000 more cases by Christmas Day - but says this figure could reach 135,000. It alsoestimated that there could be between 1,300 and 1,800 deaths in the weeks leading up to by 25 December,external. More than 445,000 cases have been confirmed in Canada and 13,130
people have died since the pandemic began. Chief Public Health Officer Theresa Tam said ""a stronger
response is needed now in all large provinces to slow the spread of Covid-19"". Canada's health regulator approved the Pfizer-BioNTech
vaccine the day after the UK became the first country in the world to roll it
out. Health Canada said thevaccine met its ""stringent safety, efficacy and quality requirements"". Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada will receive
up to 249,000 doses of the vaccine this month. The Canadian government has
purchased 20 million doses of the vaccine - enough to inoculate 10 million
people - with the option to buy 56 million more. A new-born giraffe has been named Margaret in honour of the world's first Covid vaccine patient. Staff at Whipsnade Zoo in Bedfordshire picked the name because the female calf was born on Tuesday - thesame day Margaret Keenan, 90, received the Pfizer/BioNTech jab in Coventry. She was the first person to receive the jab outside of a clinical trial. Team leader Mark Holden said: ""The arrival of our precious giraffe calf on the same day, and actually at the same time, as the much-anticipated Covid-19 vaccination was first administered feels like a real moment of hope, and one we are so keen to celebrate and remember."" The zoo says it hopes Mrs Keenan will be able to visit her namesake one day soon. It might be found at the bottom of the globe, but New Zealand has been at the top of the movie industry in 2020. Thanks to its handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, the country is enjoying an unprecedented boom in film production, with directors seeking safe conditions, and that most elusive thing this year - a normal life. International blockbusters including James Cameron's Avatar sequels, Amazon's Lord of the Rings series and Jane Campion's The Power of the Dog - starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Kirsten Dunst - all managed complex film shoots in New Zealand this year. The country's home-grown movies have also received a boost at the box office by Kiwis supporting their industry, leading one local filmmaker to joke that they're now living in ""the Hollywood of the Pacific"". New Zealand, like so many other countries, did experience a lockdown in March, But because it managed to eliminate community transmission of the virus,apart from an incident in Auckland in August,film production could resume by summer, with Avatar one of the first projects to start up again. Read more on this story from the BBC's Emma Jones here. Pallab GhoshScience correspondent, BBC News The latest estimate of the R number for the UK is 0.9 and 1 â up very slightly on the previous week â according to the latest Office for National Statistics infection survey This means that the epidemic is still shrinking after lockdown measures, but very slowly. The survey indicates that cases continued to fall in most of England and Northern Ireland last week. But the view of the governmentâs scientific advisors is that the situation is fragile. Cases are increasing in London and the East of England â especially among secondary school age children â and previous experience indicates that a surge among older age groups will inevitably follow. The advisors believe that it will be important to keep infection levels as low as possible in the run up to the holidays. Thatâs because the relaxation of restrictions that permit families to meet over Christmas will accelerate any increase in cases â and lead to another sharp spike in infections early in the New Year. Students aged 14 to 16 will switch to remote learning in
Sweden's capital, Stockholm, local authorities have announced. Lessons should be switched to online as
soon as possible, they added. ""We need to dramatically reduce the amount of contact between one another, "" said Maria Rotzen Ostlund,the region's infectious diseases doctor,external. She said that distance learning would not be enough and
stressed the importance of limiting social contacts to as few people as
possible. Ostlund also recommended that employers allow their staff
to work from home where possible. Stockholm is one of the worst affected regions in the
country, accounting for a third of Sweden's confirmed Covid-related death toll, according to Reuters news agency. The Swedish government is aiming to offer the vaccine to all of thoseover the age of 18 during the first half of 2021.,external Sweden has recorded 312,728 cases and 7,354 deaths since the
pandemic began, according to Johns Hopkins University. A recommended Â£3,300 pay rise for UK MPs has been scrapped over concerns it would ""not reflect the reality"" the public is facing during the pandemic. The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority ordered a pay freeze for the next financial year. The basic salary for MPs is currently Â£79,468-a-year, and many were already promising to refuse or give away the extra money at a time when many of their constituents were struggling. Prime Minister Boris Johnson had also joined Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer in urging the IPSA not to go ahead with its plans. The rise was set in October - based on the official statistic for public sector earnings growth.  But IPSA came under more pressure to scrap it after thechancellor imposed a pay cap on millions of public sector workersbecause of the financial impact of Covid on government finances. IPSA chairman Richard Lloyd wrote to MPs saying a pay rise ""would result in a salary increase for MPs that would be inconsistent with the wider economic data and would not reflect the reality that many constituents are facing this year"".

This video can not be played The World Health Organization's regional director for Europe, Hans Kluge, has backed a warning from German Chancellor Angela Merkel that it will take some time for the new coronavirus vaccines to turn the pandemic around. Mrs Merkel told the German parliament the country would not be able to vaccinate enough of its citizens to change the course of the pandemic in the first quarter of 2021. Mr Kluge said the delayed effects of vaccination programmes highlighted the need to prioritise key workers and vulnerable groups first. He also warned of the effects of relaxing rules too much around Christmas: ""I am very concerned. Now every 17 seconds someone is dying of Covid-19, which may double if people are relaxing,"" he told BBC World News. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst People are screened at a clinic in Huanggang, in China's central Hubei province (file photo) A number of people in central China have been fined and
told to self-isolate after they bought imported pork online that could potentially
have been contaminated with Covid-19. According to the national Global Times newspaper, 24
residents in Huanggang, central Hubei province, have been fined 200 yuan
(Â£23; $30.50) for buying imported pork from Brazil via the Meituan shopping
platform. The pork should have been destroyed rather than sold because, as
the newspaper notes,batches had already tested positive for Covid-19,external. An investigation is now being carried out into the
shopping platform. One of the big concerns in China is how imported food might carry the virus, and so the country is stepping up regulation to
prevent ordinary consumers from directly getting their hands on such goods. This week, China's top court announced that e-commerce platforms
could be ""held legally responsible for food safety issues,externalrelated to products
purchased on their platforms"". China says that many of its localised Covid-19 outbreaks over the
last year have been linked to imported cold-chain goods, and there are regular
news stories about coastal regions discovering the virus on overseas goods.
Many of the first patients in cities that have experienced outbreaks have been
workers who handle such products. UK airport operator Heathrow has said it will keep Terminal 4 closed until the end of next year as the pandemic continues to affect travel. The company said passenger numbers at the airport - usually one of the busiest in the world - fell 88% in November ""as travel restrictions and a second lockdown took their toll"". Based on forecasts and current traffic, it said it would extend the closure of Terminal 4 until the end of 2021. Heathrow shut the terminal in May during the first national lockdown. It led to airlines such as Air France, Etihad and KLM moving to Terminal 2. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played shops Non-essential shops across much of western Scotland - including Glasgow - are reopening for the first time in three weeks. Retailers in the 11 council areas that had been under the country's toughest lockdown rules were able to welcome customers from 06:00. But pubs, cafes and restaurants will have to remain closed until Saturday. It comes as the areas move from level four to level three in the country's tiered system of Covid restrictions. More than two million people had been subject to the level four restrictions since 20 November. BBC Scotland business reporter Andrew Black said Glasgow's Buchanan Street was quite quiet apart from a few delivery vans shortly after 06:00, with many shops choosing not to reopen until an hour or two later. Have the level four restrictions worked? What are the latest Covid rules in Scotland? What level is your council area in? Small queues started to form outside some stores later in the morning. It was hoped that staggering opening times would limit the number of shoppers that would be flocking to the city centre at the same time. Almost half of Scotland's non-essential stores are thought to have been shut by the level four rules, which industry bodies estimated had cost a combined Â£12.5m a day in lost revenues. Three other council areas - Inverclyde, Falkirk and Angus - are moving down from level three to level two from 18:00 on Friday. And both Dumfries and Galloway and the Scottish Borders will be downgraded from level two to level one. There has been controversy over the decision tokeep Edinburgh in level threedespite the city having lower rates of the virus than some level two areas. And opposition parties have described anadditional Â£185m of Scottish government fundingfor businesses hit by Covid restrictions as ""too little, too late"". The centre of Glasgow was busy with shoppers as stores reopened The level four restrictions were imposed in a bid to slow spiralling transmission rates across Glasgow and many of its surrounding areas. All 11 areas have seen case numbers fall since then, but there have been warnings that they could increase again ahead of Christmas unless people continue to be careful and stick to the rules. Strict travel restrictions will remain in place - so it will still be against the law for people outside of Glasgow to travel to the city to do their Christmas shopping, for example. And shoppers have been urged to avoid peak hours and crowded shops, and to consider ordering online or by phone and then collecting in store to limit the amount of time they have to spend in shops. Barbers and hairdressers were among the businesses that had to close under the level four rules Scottish Retail Consortium (SRC) director David Lonsdale said the easing of restrictions would allow shops to ""get back to work, get back to serving their customers and generate some of the revenues they will need to tide themselves over in the leaner months of the new year"". But he said greater clarity was needed from the government over rates relief for the coming year, and proposed a high street voucher scheme to boost consumer spending -similar to the one being developed in Northern Ireland. The Scottish government has said it is considering the voucher idea. Stuart Patrick, the chief executive of Glasgow Chambers of Commerce, warned the picture was still grim for many retailers, especially because of the travel restrictions. He told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""Let's not get too excited - the stranglehold on business may have been loosened but their hands are still pretty firmly around the throats of businesses that employ about 30,000 people in Glasgow city centre."" The changes to the tiers do not come into force until 18:00, meaning hospitality businesses - which must close at that time in level three areas - will not be able to welcome back customers for food and non-alcoholic drinks until Saturday. But retailers that had been closed due to the level four restrictions have been given special permission to open their doors from 06:00 on Friday. The easing of the restrictions will also allow ""close contact"" businesses such as hairdressers, barbers and beauticians to reopen, as well as visitor attractions, outdoor contact sports and training for children. Gyms can also open for individual exercise, but indoor group exercise activities are not allowed - although there is an exemption for under-18s. However, soft play, funfairs, snooker and pool halls, indoor bowling alleys, casinos and bingo halls will remain closed and outdoor live events are banned. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the decline in cases across the level four areas could ""very easily go into reverse"" unless people continued to abide by the rules. She said this was particularly true of the ban on visiting other people's houses - which remains in place across all of mainland Scotland. The first minister added: ""I cannot emphasise enough to you today that the very, very last thing we want to see is overcrowding in or around shops and shopping centres."" The deaths of a further 31 people who had tested positive for the virus were recorded across Scotland on Friday, bringing the total by that measure to 4,070. But data released by the National Records of Scotland on Wednesday showed that a total of 5,868 people have died with confirmed or suspected cases of the virus since the pandemic began. And a total of 104,306 people have now tested positive - 999 of whom are currently in hospital. The 1,001 positive tests recorded in the last 24 hours is the highest daily figure since 26 November. The latest data shows the R number - the average number of people infected by each person with Covid-19 - has fallen further below one, which experts say shows that the restrictions are having the desired effect. The country has also started to vaccinate people with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine after an initial batch of 65,000 doses arrived at the weekend - with more due next week.

"UK banks are well prepared for serious economic shocks and can continue to lend during the pandemic, the Bank of England has said. Banks have built up strong capital buffers since the financial crisis more than a decade ago, the Bank said inits latest financial stability report,external. Most risks to the UK's financial stability posed by a no-deal Brexit have been mitigated, it said. But it warned that ""some disruption to financial services could arise"". Businesses, with the support of government guarantees, have borrowed Â£80bn so far this year, compared with Â£20bn by this time last year, according to the Bank. It said the major UK banks could absorb credit losses in the order of Â£200bn, but that would involve ""incredibly severe"" shocks that were unlikely to occur. For instance, unemployment would have to rise to 15% and house prices to fall by 30%. UK growth slows again in October as rebound stalls UK unemployment rate continues to surge Former Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee member Andrew Sentance told the BBC that the Bank saw the banking system as ""very resilient"". ""I think that the Bank's assessment makes sense,"" he said. However, he warned that outside the financial system, a no-deal Brexit would pose big challenges. ""The real economy is going to struggle if we go into a Brexit no-deal,"" he added. ""Financial sector preparations for the end of the transition period with the EU are now in their final stages,"" the Bank's report said. ""Most risks to UK financial stability that could arise from disruption to the provision of cross-border financial services at the end of the transition period have been mitigated."" However, it added: ""Financial stability is not the same as market stability or the avoidance of any disruption to users of financial services. Some market volatility and disruption to financial services, particularly to EU-based clients, could arise."" The Bank said financial institutions should continue taking measures to minimise disruption. On the housing market, the Bank noted that activity had picked up sharply in recent months, but the number of advertised mortgage products had continued to fall and was ""materially lower"" than earlier in the year. ""While some lenders have reintroduced products since the early stages of the pandemic, others have withdrawn further, especially at higher [loan-to-value] ratios,"" it said. The Bank said it was important to prevent a rapid build-up of mortgage debt, which it said had ""historically been an important source of risk to financial and economic stability"". To that end, the Bank's Financial Policy Committee had recommended limiting the proportion of new mortgages with high loan to income ratios, guarding against an increase in the number of highly indebted households. Those recommendations are under review and the conclusions will be published next year.

"Disney has unveiled plans for a major expansion of its Star Wars and Marvel franchises on its Disney+ subscription streaming service. The company said that its upcoming films Peter Pan & Wendy and Tom Hanks' Pinocchio would be launched directly on to Disney+, skipping theatres. But it also announced price increases from February next year. Disney is the latest major studio to divert its focus from cinema to streaming. Last week Warner Brothers said all its 2021 releases would debut on HBO Max. The coronavirus crisis has hit the film and entertainment industry hard, and cinemas are desperate for content to lure viewers back with new entertainment that can initially only be seen on their screens. But content producers want to cater to audiences who may not be ready to go back to cinemas. The Mandalorian is a big hit for Disney+ As part of the expansion, Disney is raising prices from Â£5.99 a month to Â£7.99 a month from 23 February. Prices will also increase in other countries by a similar amount. Disney said that it planned to offer 10 new TV series in its Marvel and Star Wars franchises over the next few years. These include new series of Disney+'s biggest hit, The Mandalorian, featuring a Star Wars character who is the same species as Yoda. Another Star Wars series, Andor, starring Diego Luna as the character he played in 2016's Rogue One film, was also announced. Dune and Matrix 4 streaming plan prompts urgent talks from AMC cinemas Cineworld eyes UK cinema closures and rescue deal More Star Wars animated series, The Bad Batch and A Droid Story are also in the works, the company said. Another 15 live-action Disney Animation and Pixar shows and 15 Disney Animation and Pixar feature films will be available on the streaming service. Executives said that customers should expect something new every week. The news comes after a Warner Bros said last week that it would debut all 17 of its 2021 movies on its HBO Max streaming service on the same day they are released in cinemas. But not every announcement was exclusively focused on streaming. Wonder Woman director Patty Jenkins will become the first woman to direct a Star Wars film, Rogue Squadron, which focuses on a fighter pilot team in the Star Wars universe. It is scheduled for December 2023. Other notable announcements included: Black Panther 2 will not replace the late Chadwick Bosemanin the title role A third Ant-Man film, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, is now in development Marvel Studios will make its own Fantastic Four movie following the acquisition of Fox, which owned the rights to the iconic Marvel superheroes A new Indiana Jones film with Harrison Fordis scheduled for release in July 2022 Lightyear, an origin story for Toy Story's Buzz Lightyear, is being made by Pixar A new Chip N' Dale film combining animation and live action Disney also announced a new streaming brand called Star, which will be part of Disney+ but stream shows from its other brands such as FX and 20th Century. That includes a newly-announced TV series based on the Alien series of sci-fi films, but no date or plot details were given. Disney+, which was launched just over a year ago, now has 86.8 million subscribers - a figure far exceeding its own predictions for customer growth. Together with its Hulu and ESPN sports streaming services the company has about 137 million subscribers in total. Disney+ is still well behind Netflix, which boasts nearly 200 million subscribers worldwide. But the number of subscribers it has amassed, in such a short period of time, will have more established streaming services looking over their shoulders. Disney shares rose during its annual investor presentation.

"This video can not be played US Covid vaccine: Three key questions answered The US Food and Drug Administration has authorised the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine for emergency use. The agency said the authorisation was a ""significant milestone"" in the pandemic, which taken more than 295,000 lives in the US. The vaccine, which offers up to 95% protection against Covid-19, was deemed safe and effective by the FDA. President Donald Trump said the first vaccinations will take place ""in less than 24 hours"". ""Today our nation has achieved a medical miracle,"" Mr Trump said. ""We have delivered a safe and effective vaccine in just nine months."" Before the announcement on Friday night, the FDA had come under intense pressure from the Trump administration to approve the vaccine's use. The head of the agency, Stephen Hahn, was told to approve it for emergency use by Friday or quit, US media reported, although he called this ""untrue"". In further comments at a news conference on Saturday, Mr Hahn said he was ready to be vaccinated as soon as the vaccine was available and stressed that the agency had not compromised safety in its testing. The issue of allergies was also addressed after testing in the UK produced a small number of allergic reactions. Dr Peter Marks, the head of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research said the few reactions in the UK ""were not seen in the larger trial data sets, but we still need to know more and we'll be taking precautions"". He added that the FDA was ""comfortable giving the vaccine to patients who have had other allergic reactions other than severe allergic reactions to a vaccine or one of its components"". His advice was that those with a history of allergies should consult a doctor. Covid: When can I get vaccinated in the US? Safety data on Pfizer jab released by US How does the Pfizer vaccine work? Health and Human Services Secretary, Alex Azar, told reporters earlier on Friday that his department would work with Pfizer to get the mass vaccination programme started by Monday or Tuesday. The Pfizer vaccine has already received regulatory approval in the UK, Canada, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia. Like those countries, the US will give its first doses of the vaccine to the elderly, health workers and emergency crew. Coronavirus deaths have been rising sharply since November in the US. On Wednesday, the country recorded more than 3,000 deaths - the highest total in a single day anywhere in the world. ""The FDA's authorisation for emergency use of the first Covid-19 vaccine is a significant milestone in battling this devastating pandemic that has affected so many families in the United States and around the world,"" said Mr Hahn. He said the authorisation came after ""an open and transparent review process"" that ensured the vaccine met the ""FDA's rigorous, scientific standards for safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing quality"". The Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine is expected to be rolled out in the coming days On Thursday, medical experts advising the FDA recommended the emergency-use authorisation. A 23-member panel concluded the vaccine's benefits outweighed its risks. Emergency use, the FDA said, is not the same as full approval, which would require Pfizer to file a separate application to secure. ""While not an FDA approval, today's emergency use authorisation of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine holds the promise to alter the course of this pandemic in the United States,"" said Dr Marks. On Friday, President Trump sent out an angry tweet calling the FDA a ""big, old, slow turtle"", adding: ""Get the dam vaccines out NOW, Dr Hahn. Stop playing games and start saving lives."" The Washington Post said that White House chief of staff Mark Meadows had ordered Mr Hahn to approve the vaccine on Friday or submit his resignation, citing three sources. US media reported that FDA Commissioner Hahn had been ordered to approve the vaccine's use by Friday But Mr Hahn told US media he had only been ""encouraged to continue working expeditiously"" on the vaccine's approval, and that the media representation of the chief of staff's phone call was ""untrue"". Amid the reports of White House pressure, President-elect Joe Biden said he wanted to make it clear to the public that they should have confidence in the vaccine, adding: ""There is no political influence."" The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was the first coronavirus jab to show promising results in the latter stages of its testing process. It is a new type called an mRNA vaccine that uses a tiny fragment of genetic code from the pandemic virus to teach the body how to fight Covid-19 and build immunity. ""The vaccine contains a small piece of the [Covid-19] virus's mRNA that instructs cells in the body to make the virus's distinctive 'spike' protein,"" the FDA said. This video can not be played How will the new Pfizer vaccine work? ""When a person receives this vaccine, their body produces copies of the spike protein, which does not cause disease, but triggers the immune system to learn to react defensively, producing an immune response against [Covid-19]."" The vaccine is given as two injections, 21 days apart, with the second dose being a booster. Immunity begins to kick in after the first dose but reaches its full effect seven days after the second dose. Operation Warp Speed says that vaccine deliveries will begin within 24 hours of approval. ""We have made sure that this vaccine will be free, for all Americans,"" Mr Trump said in a recorded video posted to Twitter. ""We have already begun shipping the vaccine to every state and zip code in the country. The first vaccine will be administered in less than 24 hours."" Allow Twitter content?

Pfizer plans to have 6.4 million doses ready for the US in its first rollout round in late December. Because two injections are required per person, that is enough for three million people, out of a total US population of 330 million. Federal officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) say the nation's 21 million healthcare workers should be prioritised first, as well the three million elderly Americans living in long-term care homes. But there is less consensus on how states should distribute it to other groups. The nation's approximately 87 million essential workers are expected to be next in line for the jab, but it will be up to states to decide which industries to prioritise. Mr Trump said vaccines ""will vanquish the virus and return life back to normal"". But officials say vaccinations for groups that are not at a high risk are expected to take place in the spring of 2021. A second vaccine, developed by Moderna and the National Institutes of Health, is also seeking emergency approval in the US. Like the Pfizer vaccine it requires a second round of injections.

"This video can not be played shops Non-essential shops across much of western Scotland - including Glasgow - are reopening for the first time in three weeks. Retailers in the 11 council areas that had been under the country's toughest lockdown rules were able to welcome customers from 06:00. But pubs, cafes and restaurants will have to remain closed until Saturday. It comes as the areas move from level four to level three in the country's tiered system of Covid restrictions. More than two million people had been subject to the level four restrictions since 20 November. BBC Scotland business reporter Andrew Black said Glasgow's Buchanan Street was quite quiet apart from a few delivery vans shortly after 06:00, with many shops choosing not to reopen until an hour or two later. Have the level four restrictions worked? What are the latest Covid rules in Scotland? What level is your council area in? Small queues started to form outside some stores later in the morning. It was hoped that staggering opening times would limit the number of shoppers that would be flocking to the city centre at the same time. Almost half of Scotland's non-essential stores are thought to have been shut by the level four rules, which industry bodies estimated had cost a combined Â£12.5m a day in lost revenues. Three other council areas - Inverclyde, Falkirk and Angus - are moving down from level three to level two from 18:00 on Friday. And both Dumfries and Galloway and the Scottish Borders will be downgraded from level two to level one. There has been controversy over the decision tokeep Edinburgh in level threedespite the city having lower rates of the virus than some level two areas. And opposition parties have described anadditional Â£185m of Scottish government fundingfor businesses hit by Covid restrictions as ""too little, too late"". The centre of Glasgow was busy with shoppers as stores reopened The level four restrictions were imposed in a bid to slow spiralling transmission rates across Glasgow and many of its surrounding areas. All 11 areas have seen case numbers fall since then, but there have been warnings that they could increase again ahead of Christmas unless people continue to be careful and stick to the rules. Strict travel restrictions will remain in place - so it will still be against the law for people outside of Glasgow to travel to the city to do their Christmas shopping, for example. And shoppers have been urged to avoid peak hours and crowded shops, and to consider ordering online or by phone and then collecting in store to limit the amount of time they have to spend in shops. Barbers and hairdressers were among the businesses that had to close under the level four rules Scottish Retail Consortium (SRC) director David Lonsdale said the easing of restrictions would allow shops to ""get back to work, get back to serving their customers and generate some of the revenues they will need to tide themselves over in the leaner months of the new year"". But he said greater clarity was needed from the government over rates relief for the coming year, and proposed a high street voucher scheme to boost consumer spending -similar to the one being developed in Northern Ireland. The Scottish government has said it is considering the voucher idea. Stuart Patrick, the chief executive of Glasgow Chambers of Commerce, warned the picture was still grim for many retailers, especially because of the travel restrictions. He told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""Let's not get too excited - the stranglehold on business may have been loosened but their hands are still pretty firmly around the throats of businesses that employ about 30,000 people in Glasgow city centre."" The changes to the tiers do not come into force until 18:00, meaning hospitality businesses - which must close at that time in level three areas - will not be able to welcome back customers for food and non-alcoholic drinks until Saturday. But retailers that had been closed due to the level four restrictions have been given special permission to open their doors from 06:00 on Friday. The easing of the restrictions will also allow ""close contact"" businesses such as hairdressers, barbers and beauticians to reopen, as well as visitor attractions, outdoor contact sports and training for children. Gyms can also open for individual exercise, but indoor group exercise activities are not allowed - although there is an exemption for under-18s. However, soft play, funfairs, snooker and pool halls, indoor bowling alleys, casinos and bingo halls will remain closed and outdoor live events are banned. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the decline in cases across the level four areas could ""very easily go into reverse"" unless people continued to abide by the rules. She said this was particularly true of the ban on visiting other people's houses - which remains in place across all of mainland Scotland. The first minister added: ""I cannot emphasise enough to you today that the very, very last thing we want to see is overcrowding in or around shops and shopping centres."" The deaths of a further 31 people who had tested positive for the virus were recorded across Scotland on Friday, bringing the total by that measure to 4,070. But data released by the National Records of Scotland on Wednesday showed that a total of 5,868 people have died with confirmed or suspected cases of the virus since the pandemic began. And a total of 104,306 people have now tested positive - 999 of whom are currently in hospital. The 1,001 positive tests recorded in the last 24 hours is the highest daily figure since 26 November. The latest data shows the R number - the average number of people infected by each person with Covid-19 - has fallen further below one, which experts say shows that the restrictions are having the desired effect. The country has also started to vaccinate people with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine after an initial batch of 65,000 doses arrived at the weekend - with more due next week.

"UK banks are well prepared for serious economic shocks and can continue to lend during the pandemic, the Bank of England has said. Banks have built up strong capital buffers since the financial crisis more than a decade ago, the Bank said inits latest financial stability report,external. Most risks to the UK's financial stability posed by a no-deal Brexit have been mitigated, it said. But it warned that ""some disruption to financial services could arise"". Businesses, with the support of government guarantees, have borrowed Â£80bn so far this year, compared with Â£20bn by this time last year, according to the Bank. It said the major UK banks could absorb credit losses in the order of Â£200bn, but that would involve ""incredibly severe"" shocks that were unlikely to occur. For instance, unemployment would have to rise to 15% and house prices to fall by 30%. UK growth slows again in October as rebound stalls UK unemployment rate continues to surge Former Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee member Andrew Sentance told the BBC that the Bank saw the banking system as ""very resilient"". ""I think that the Bank's assessment makes sense,"" he said. However, he warned that outside the financial system, a no-deal Brexit would pose big challenges. ""The real economy is going to struggle if we go into a Brexit no-deal,"" he added. ""Financial sector preparations for the end of the transition period with the EU are now in their final stages,"" the Bank's report said. ""Most risks to UK financial stability that could arise from disruption to the provision of cross-border financial services at the end of the transition period have been mitigated."" However, it added: ""Financial stability is not the same as market stability or the avoidance of any disruption to users of financial services. Some market volatility and disruption to financial services, particularly to EU-based clients, could arise."" The Bank said financial institutions should continue taking measures to minimise disruption. On the housing market, the Bank noted that activity had picked up sharply in recent months, but the number of advertised mortgage products had continued to fall and was ""materially lower"" than earlier in the year. ""While some lenders have reintroduced products since the early stages of the pandemic, others have withdrawn further, especially at higher [loan-to-value] ratios,"" it said. The Bank said it was important to prevent a rapid build-up of mortgage debt, which it said had ""historically been an important source of risk to financial and economic stability"". To that end, the Bank's Financial Policy Committee had recommended limiting the proportion of new mortgages with high loan to income ratios, guarding against an increase in the number of highly indebted households. Those recommendations are under review and the conclusions will be published next year.

"Shoppers in Belfast city centre on Friday Non-essential retail and some parts of the hospitality sector in Northern Ireland are now able to reopen. A two-week limited lockdown, which was imposed on 27 November, ended at 23:59 GMT on Thursday. Restaurants, cafes and other venues serving food can resume trading, however pubs that do not serve food must remain shut. Ahead of the reopening, Health Minister Robin Swann warned against a ""festive free-for-all"". On Thursday night theNI Executive's new Covid-19 regulations were published.,external The regulations, which came into force just before midnight on Thursday, provided further details on the latest rules. This video can not be played Coronavirus: 'It's good to see some atmosphere in town again' They state that any food served must have been prepared ""in a static and permanent kitchen on the premises of the bar, hotel, pub or club and which is eaten by a person seated at a table"". Reopening in Ballymena: Shops focus on survival as shutters go up once more Reopening in Londonderry: Traders have 'mixed feelings' They also outline that every person who visits hospitality must provide their name and telephone number. Other restrictions that have been lifted: Hairdressers, barbers and beauty salons can reopen but visits to them are by appointment only Churches can resume services, while weddings and funerals will have their cap of 25 people lifted- a risk assessment should be carried out to determine how many people a venue can safely accommodate Gyms can reopen for individual training but not for classes Sports training and matches can resume at all levels Up to 500 spectators can attend outdoor sporting events Households are still not allowed to mix indoors in private homes, except where strict exemptions apply. These restrictions willpartially ease on 23 December for five days over the Christmas period. A two-week limited lockdown, which was imposed on 27 November has ended Confirming the lifting of restrictions on Thursday, First Minister Arlene Foster said the reproduction (R) number, was around 1, giving the Stormont Executive the ""necessary headroom to move ahead with the planned changes"". On Thursday, another 14 coronavirus-related deaths were recorded by Northern Ireland's Department of Health, bringing the total number of deaths to 1,099. A further 441 people have also tested positive for the virus. Shoppers were out and about in Banbridge on Friday morning Mrs Foster said: ""People have to realise that personal responsibility is the key issue here. We have made provision that people can get together over Christmas, but they should do so in a safe way. ""We are keeping a very close eye on where the R number is at. We'll be looking at it again next week, and the week after to see where we're going with restrictions."" Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said the decision to lift some restrictions was ""supported by the public health team"". ""The next number of weeks are crucial,"" she said. ""If people want to have a nice Christmas with their family, don't ruin it by being reckless in the next number of weeks."" For the hospitality industry there are a number of restrictions which will still apply: All hospitality venues must close by 23:00 GMT A maximum of six people from no more than two households can be seated at a table More than six will be permitted if they all belong to a single household Food and drink are only allowed to be consumed when individuals are seated at a table Unless it is not reasonably practicable, the individuals seated at a table must be 2m away from the next table All venues will also be required to collect all customer details to help with the Test, Trace, Protect contact tracing programme Bob McCoubrey from the Mourne Seafood Bar in Belfast said he had to reduce capacity to 45% to adhere to social distancing rules and takings would be equivalent to ""a Monday in February"". ""It's a borderline decision for us and we still don't know if there's something in the legislation that will throw a spanner in the works,"" he said. ""Every week we were closed we were definitely losing money, I think our target is to try and break even and try and get the staff some hours before Christmas time."" Restaurateur Bob McCoubrey said he was frustrated that detailed guidance was not provided by the NI Executive sooner John McGirr, who owns Sally's of Omagh, has decided to stay closed over Christmas, despite running a bar that serves food. ""There's no certainty on how long were going to be open,"" he told BBC News NI. ""Our suppliers have been great with us, taking back stock that we ordered previously when we opened and closed, but this time they said they weren't taking any back. ""So there's a chance you'd be buying a lot more for Christmas and then be told, 'you're closing tomorrow'."" Sally's of Omagh said it looked forward to 2021 when it could ""provide everyone with a night out free from restrictions"" Derry publican Michael Flanagan owns a non-food bar and said even if he could reopen, he is not convinced he would. ""I think there is going to be a terrible spike [in coronavirus cases] in January. Good luck to anybody that can open, but I don't think this will work even in a pub that serves food. Progress on a vaccine too, he fears, may lead the public to ""drop their guard"". Health Minister Robin Swann said: ""We have to keep doing the basics - reducing our contacts, keeping our distance from others, wearing a face covering and washing our hands. ""Be aware of particularly risky settings - crowded indoor settings with poor ventilation where social distancing is difficult or impossible to maintain. ""If a shop, pub, cafÃ© or household falls into that category and looks too busy, walk away."" Retail NI Chief Executive Glyn Roberts has urged people to shop safely. ""This is the most important time of the year for retailers and many will want to make the ground lost over the past two weeks of the circuit-breaker,"" he said. ""Many of our town centres will have Covid Ambassadors, public hand sanitisers and business compliance signage which we hope will give reassurance to the general public.""

The Democratic pair beat three other finalists: frontline healthcare workers and Dr Anthony Fauci, the racial justice movement, and President Donald Trump, who lost the White House race. Time has been choosing the year's most influential person since 1927. ""For changing the American story, for showing that the forces of empathy are greater than the furies of division, for sharing a vision of healing in a grieving world, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are TIME's 2020 Person of the Year,""wrote Time's editor-in-chief Edward Felsenthal.,external Allow Twitter content?

Every year, Time chooses a person, a group, an idea or an object that ""for better or for worse"" has had the most impact on the events over the 12 months. In 2019, the publication expanded Person of the Year to include such categories as a Businessperson of the Year, Entertainer of the Year, Athlete of the Year and the Guardians of the Year. So, this year's winners are: Dr Anthony Fauci, a key member of the Coronavirus Task Force, and frontline health workers.""On the front line against Covide-19, the world's health care workers displayed the best of humanity - selflessness, compassion, stamina, courage - while protecting as much of it as they could,"" Time wrote Porche Bennett-Bey, Assa TraorÃ©, and racial-justice organisers""When George Floyd was killed in Minneapolis in May, it was proof - if anyone needed it - that Black lives are still not treated as equal in America.

Argentina's Jorge Mario Bergoglio had become Pope Francis in March of that year, and had already made his mark, rejecting the glittering trappings of the role to focus on the poorest in society. Vladimir Putin In 2007, the title went to a man who Mr Trump has repeatedly said he admires: Russian President Vladimir Putin. However, whether Time Magazine admires Mr Putin is less clear. ""TIME's Person of the Year is not and never has been an honour. It is not an endorsement,"" it wrote inan editorial explaining the decision,externalthat year. ""It is not a popularity contest. At its best, it is a clear-eyed recognition of the world as it is and of the most powerful individuals and forces shaping that world - for better or for worse.""

He was the first African American to grace the cover, and publically said later he saw it not simply as a personal victory, but a victory for the civil rights movement. King was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize the following year. Adolf Hitler If there was ever a recipient to prove the claim that Person of the Year was not an ""honour"", it was the choice for 1938.

"More than 50 schools in Belfast have written a joint letter to the education minister urging him to ""reconsider your stance on early school closure"". The letter comes from nursery, primary and post-primary schools in the West Belfast Area Learning Community (ALC). It contains a strongly-worded warning that easing many restrictions on 11 December will have a knock-on effect for schools. The schools also said that a plan is needed for January. They said ""there may be a tsunami of cases arriving in to each of our schools"" in the new year. Education Minister Peter Weirhas repeatedly stated that schools will not close early for the Christmas break. He has alsosaid that health experts have not recommended closing schools early. However some principalshave said pupils will not be marked absent if parents want them to do schoolwork at home in the final week of term. Many schools are due to end term on Friday 18 December, but some continue until 22 December. The joint letter from west Belfast schools told Mr Weir there had been a ""lack of clarity from the Department of Education, conflicting guidance from the department and Public Health Agency, and a real lack of insight from you or your department concerning the enormous volume of work which we face on a daily basis"". It said that the easing of many restrictions in other areas would have an impact on schools. ""Given that the executive has agreed to 'relax' restrictions to enable people to experience a more normal Christmas, we are fearful that this allows for increased mixing of bubbles and larger numbers of households and people being able to gather leading to increased infection rates,"" it said. Education Minister Peter Weir has repeatedly said there are no plans to close schools early for the Christmas break ""These increased risks on people's health, added pressure on NHS and likelihood of increasing mortality as a result of Covid-19 must have been judged to be tolerable in order to ensure that people are allowed to see loved ones at Christmas. ""However, failure to close schools at a time when hospitality and close-contact services resume, will undoubtedly impact on the Christmas experience of those school staff who are identified by contact tracing over the coming weeks. ""It might appear to some that whilst increasing deaths and illness rates are tolerable, safeguarding the Christmas of front-line staff such as healthcare workers and schools are not important to the executive or your department."" The letter also said that school staff had been providing constant support to pupils and parents affected by lockdown. ""Our school populations continue to grow and so, too, does the level of need and vulnerability,"" the letter said. ""We are all too aware of the 'breaking point' that some of our pupils and families have reached over the possibility of spending Christmas away from loved ones. ""This period of restrictions has been very difficult on those pupils with special educational needs, especially those suffering with Autistic Spectrum Disorder, as their ability to see loved ones from their extended family has been impacted and Christmas may be the only opportunity in the coming months."" It concludes by pleading with Mr Weir to allow school staff to teach and pupils to learn from home ""for a period of just five or six days"" before the planned end of term. ""As school leaders we also have a duty of care to our staff, pupils and the wider school community,"" it said. ""The biggest cause of stress and anxiety we see at the present time is the uncertainty people feel about their ability to see extended family over the Christmas break. ""In what has been an exceptional year for us all, can I ask that you reconsider your stance on early school closure, or at least trust in the professional judgement of school leaders to provide effective home learning opportunities which will enable the exceptionally hard working educational workforce to have the Christmas break which they have earned throughout this pandemic. ""This action, alone, has the power to do much to boost the morale and well-being of every member of staff in schools."" The government in Waleshas said all post-primary schools will move to online teaching until Christmas from Monday 14 December.

"Adam Price says something ""new and better"" should come out of the Covid crisis A vote for Plaid Cymru is now a vote for an independence referendum in Wales, the party has said. Leader Adam Price has pledged that Plaid would offer a referendum if it formed a government and got a Senedd majority to back it. It is a first for the party, which has never previously promised to offer an independence vote in the first term of a Plaid government. But the power to call a vote would still lie with the UK government. It allowed one to take place in Scotland in 2014 after the SNP won a majority in the Scottish Parliament elections three years earlier. In a speech in Cardiff Bay, Mr Price said something ""new and better"" must come out of the Covid crisis. ""Independence is the most radical idea in Welsh politics today,"" he said. Mr Price told an audience watching via social media that devolution was ""under attack"" from Boris Johnson's UK government and that Scottish demands for a second independence referendum were ""unstoppable"". ""Wales is in real danger of being left behind as part of a rump United Kingdom, in a new England-and-Wales formation - which would be the ultimate worst of all worlds,"" he said. ""It is for these reasons that I pledge today that, subject to party approval, a Plaid Cymru government, able to command a majority in the Senedd, will offer a referendum on independence for Wales in its first term."" Independence rallies attracted large crowds prior to the pandemic Previously Mr Price had said a referendum would take place in the second term of a Plaid government and before 2030. The change in policy comes in response toa reportcommissioned by the party which recommended two referendums on independence. Sport and arts figures join independence rally General election 2019: Who is Adam Price? Welsh independence referendum 'before 2030' The first was proposed as ""multi-choice"" exercise to gauge opinion, and the second a vote on the preferred option in the referendum. Now Mr Price is promising one single vote offering a choice between independence and the status quo. The political impasse over Brexit in 2019 saw a variety of pro-independence marches around Wales, organised by non-party political groups and attended by thousands of demonstrators. Referencing those events, Mr Price made a direct pitch to those who attended for their support. ""Banners and marches fuel our fire, but the Welsh spring will only truly bloom at the ballot box in May. If you want independence, you have to vote for it,"" he said. After the speech the Plaid Cymru leader added: ""I'm the only pro-independence candidate for first minister. ""If we're able to form a government and get that referendum I think we'll win it."" This is a big move from Adam Price. Even before he became leader he said Plaid should make independence their ""express purposeâ¦ sooner, rather than later"" and it's clear he feels the time is right. Brexit, and more recently the coronavirus pandemic, have moved independence into the mainstream of Welsh political conversation, as the growth of unaffiliated, pro-independence groups attest. Mr Price wants to harness that momentum going into next year's elections, but it's by no means a clear route to electoral success. Opinion polling does suggest a rise in support for Welsh independence, but it's a very long way from showing a consistent majority in favour.

"Ports such as Holyhead will need border checks whether there is a UK-EU trade deal or not There is an ""unacceptable risk"" that Welsh ports are not ready for Brexit, a group of cross-party MPs has said. Parliament's Welsh Affairs Committee said there was a ""significant risk"" neither Holyhead nor Fishguard would have facilities ready for new customs checks needed from 1 January. Conservative MP Stephen Crabb said Wales was ""far from ready"" for the end of the Brexit transition period. UK ministers said they had worked to ""secure a site"" for checks in Holyhead. They said the Welsh Government was responsible for facilities for Fishguard and Pembroke Dock, but Welsh ministers said they were only able to join the joint planning process ""late in the year"". On 31 December,the Brexit transition period, in which the UK follows EU trading rules, comes to an end. 'Price rises likely' due to UK shipping problems Honda pauses production after UK port woes Plans for 120 jobs at new Holyhead border facility Holyhead port plans 'show shambles over Brexit' The EU and the UK are trying to agree on a trade deal before then, buttrade talks are in deadlock. If no deal is reached, border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU - but deal or no deal - there will still be changes. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button Border checks and processes at Welsh ports would be needed regardless of a deal and are due to be fully implemented from 1 July 2021. But MPs expressed concern about the ""readiness"" and ""capacity"" to carry out ""thousands of new checks a day"". In their report, they warn of the implications for Holyhead Port, on Anglesey, of ""a combination of new, and untested, IT systems and new checks and processes"". The report also expressed ""deep concern"" the location of aninland facility for Holyhead Portand the equivalent facilities in south-west Wales have not yet been confirmed. Stephen Crabb said ""critical IT systems are still to be fully tested and operational"" The committee called on the UK government to publish contingency plans for how checks will be carried out on goods arriving at Holyhead in the event of inland facilities not being operational by July. They also want clarity on measures the UK government would take to ""minimise the disruption"" of checks at ports. Committee chairman and Preseli Pembrokeshire MP Mr Crabb said: ""With just two weeks until the end of the transition period, decisions over key infrastructure in Wales for carrying out these checks have still not been made and critical IT systems are still to be fully tested and operational. ""There are still too many businesses unaware of how their trade with the EU may be affected. ""Wales is far from ready for the end of the Brexit transition period. We are particularly concerned about the implications of this for Holyhead, one of the UK's busiest ports for trade with the EU. ""There are significant risks of delays and disruption to the smooth flow of trade through the port."" The committee notes inland facilities serving the south-west are the responsibility of the Welsh Government, while the UK government is leading on inland facilities for Holyhead. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Mr Crabb added it was ""vital"" the UK and Welsh governments worked together to ""make the necessary decisions on the location of facilities for carrying out new checks on goods moving through Holyhead, Fishguard and Pembroke Dock"". ""Even if decisions are finalised this month, and planning permission expedited, there is an unacceptable level of risk that neither north nor south-west Wales will have appropriate inland facilities ready for the full introduction of border checks in July 2021."" For Plaid Cymru, Ynys Mon member of the Senedd (MS) Rhun ap Iorwerth - whose seat includes Holyhead - said it was ""patently obvious that ports aren't ready"". ""At this eleventh hour we need serious mitigation and added investment to keep trade flowing and to try to protect port jobs,"" he said. The UK government said it had ""invested around Â£1bn to make sure our borders and businesses are ready"". ""In Wales we have worked with Welsh Government and others to secure a site on Anglesey for inland clearance checks for Holyhead Port. ""Responsibility for inland facilities serving the ports of Pembroke Dock and Fishguard is devolved and is a matter for the Welsh Government."" The Welsh Government said it had been asking to be involved in the planning since the start of the year. ""Welsh ministers were only approached late in the year to get involved in joint planning, including requirements at Welsh ports, so precious time has been lost,"" a spokesperson said.Â ""We are working closely with the relevant local authorities and ports to minimise disruption to our ports and that business, partners and users of the ports are kept informed as these discussions progress.""

The BBCannounced,externalit is dedicating Friday's Evening schedule on BBC One to Dame Barbara ""in loving memory"". It is showingBabsat 19:35 GMT- a dramatisation of her life story - followed by EastEnders at 21:05 GMT. Shane Richie played Alfie 2002 alongside Dame Barbara's Peggy in the soap Dame Barbara was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in 2014 and hadmoved to a care home earlier this year. She appeared in nine films in the Carry On comedy series, plus Sparrows Can't Sing, for which she was nominated for a Bafta, as well as parts in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and On the Fiddle with Sir Sean Connery. She was well-known to millions of TV viewers for her portrayal of landlady Peggy Mitchell in EastEnders, starring alongside her on-screen children Ross Kemp and Steve McFadden. This video can not be played Some of Dame Barbara Windsor's highlights as Peggy Mitchell Her last appearance in the soap came in 2016, the same year she was made a dame for her services to charity and entertainment. She also worked in theatre - making her stage debut at 13 - and appeared in productions including Oh! What A Lovely War and Fings Ain't Wot They Used To Be. The moment you met her, she had an ability to make you feel like an old friend.  She was funny, warm and engagingly open, she would arrive in a room and bring with her a little ripple of warmth. And the character you saw on TV and film was remarkably close to the person you would chat to before and after an interview.  She was from a generation of working-class actors who had got their break in the 60s when theatre directors like Joan Littlewood were looking for talent that seemed real and natural on stage and screen. That's not to say she wasn't also tough and canny enough to know how to turn on the charm.  Her life was a story filled with gangsters, set backs and determination to succeed. She had decided to act when she was a child and there was behind the laughter the sort of steel you need to have a career that lasts nearly 70 years.  There was a definitely something of her character in the tough EastEnders landlady, Peggy Mitchell. But she was always open about her ups and downs, she didn't hide the flaws and vulnerabilities, which only made her all the more likeable. After her dementia diagnosis, Dame Barbara became an ambassador for the Alzheimer's Society andmet Mr Johnson to raise awareness about the disease. The star delivered a letter signed by 100,000 people pleading for better care for people affected by dementia and saying the system was ""completely inadequate, unfair, unsustainable and in dire need of more money"". Dame Barbara Windsor married Scott Mitchell in 2000 Mr Mitchell, who campaigned alongside his wife, said of her death: ""It was not the ending that Barbara or anyone else living with this very cruel disease deserve. ""I will always be immensely proud of Barbara's courage, dignity and generosity dealing with her own illness and still trying to help others by raising awareness for as long as she could."" The couple went public with her diagnosis in 2018 and Mr Mitchell had said they had been ""really nervous"" about revealing she was affected by the condition. In his statement he thanked the public, family and friends for support which he said ""Barbara deeply appreciated"". He added: ""I've lost my wife, my best friend and soul mate and my heart or life will never feel the same without you."" The Alzheimer's Society said it was ""incredibly grateful"" to Dame Barbara and her husband for their work bringing awareness to the disease. In a statement, the charity said: ""Dame Barbara Windsor was an amazingly true, much-loved national treasure, and in speaking out about her experiences shone like a beacon for others affected by dementia."" Like her EastEnders character, Dame Barbara was born in east London, in Shoreditch in 1937. She married three times,including to small-time criminal Ronnie Knight, and she also dated gangster Charlie Kray and his brother Reggie. The actress married Mr Mitchell in 2000, with the pair having first met in 1992. If you, or someone you know, has been affected by dementia you can find more information and supporthere.

"This video can not be played The day the US began Covid vaccinations As health workers begin receiving Covid-19 vaccinations across the US, many Americans are asking when they will be able to get their shots. It's complicated, but this is what we know. Americans who are under 65 and healthy may be able to get their vaccinations as early as April, says Dr Anthony Fauci, who heads the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The Trump administration's health secretary, Alex Azar, predicts that by ""late February, into March,"" Americans will be able to get vaccinated at pharmacy and grocery chains like CVS and Walmart. But cases in the US are continuing to spike as winter sends people indoors and the holidays bring families together. More than 300,000 Americans have died and 16.5 million have been infected since January 2020, and the US faces an uphill battle the curb the virus. Here's what you need to know about getting vaccinated in the US. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines submitted to US states say that the nation's 21 million healthcare workers should be prioritised first, as well the three million elderly Americans living in long-term care homes. Approximately 87 million essential workers are expected to be next in line for the jab, but it will be up to states to decide which industries to prioritise. Moncef Slaoui, the chief scientist of federal vaccine distribution programme Operation Warp Speed, says the young and healthy should be last in the line. At least 70% or 80% of the US population of 330 million have to be vaccinated in order to achieve herd immunity,he warned on Monday,external. Officials say vaccinations for groups that are not at a high risk are expected to take place in the spring of 2021. One of the main challenges with vaccinating the US population is producing and distributing the shots. Vaccinations in the US began on 14 December, with a critical care nurse in New York City receiving the first injection of a drug developed by Pfizer and BioNTech. Pfizer, based in New York, and German company BioNTech received emergency authorisation from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) after data found their vaccine 95% effective in preventing infections. On Tuesday, the FDA reported that Moderna, a US company seeking approval for its vaccine, produced a drug that is 94% effective in warding off the virus. The rollout of this drug could begin early next week. How does the Pfizer vaccine work? How do the Covid vaccines compare? What you need to know about vaccine safety The FDA's Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) allows a drug to be used as a treatment while studies are still being carried out to determine safety and effectiveness. Critics say the process is less rigorous and more likely to lead to health complications. Johnson & Johnson, another US drug company, is currently testing a vaccine and could have enough data to submit an EUA request by January. This video can not be played Five challenges of distributing a Covid-19 vaccine around the world. Pfizer's first shipment of vaccine to the US saw 2.9 million doses sent to multiple locations around the country. The company says they hope to have enough vaccine for 25 million Americans produced by the end of the year, and enough for 50 million by March. The US has agreed to buy 200 million doses of vaccine from Moderna, a company that has never previously had a product approved by the FDA. If approved, US officials say the Massachusetts-based company will immediately ship around six million doses to 3,285 sites across the US - far more locations than Pfizer's initial rollout. Both vaccines require a second round of injections. Some pharmacies have been tapped to use their electronic networks to alert patients when it is time to receive their second shot. For Pfizer, the second jab comes three weeks after the first. For Moderna it is four weeks after the first shot. Johnson & Johnson's experimental vaccine is the only one being developed that relies on a single jab. This video can not be played How will the new Pfizer vaccine work? Even as distribution begins, the drug manufacturers must continue to seek full - rather than emergency - approval, as the FDA continues to monitor the vaccines for any side-effects. Health experts say the vaccine's arrival does not mean life will immediately return to normal. ""A vaccine will complement the other tools we have, not replace them,"" said Tedros Ghebreyesus, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO). ""A vaccine on its own will not end the pandemic."" Hand-washing, social distancing and mask-wearing will remain the norm until enough of the population has been vaccinated. Dr Fauci says Americans may be able to roll back those necessary precautions by the autumn of 2021 if 70% of the US population has been vaccinated by then. There are ongoing concerns regarding how many Americans are willing to get vaccinated. Arecent Gallup poll,externalfound that 58% say they would be willing to get the jab, up from a low of 50% in September. How do we know the vaccine is safe? It also remains to be seen how racial minorities - who are at a higher risk of catching the virus and dying from it - will be prioritised and what level of trust they will have in the government-issued vaccine. Former US presidents Barack Obama, George W Bush and Bill Clinton havevowed to be vaccinated on camera, in an effort to encourage others to get the jab. President Donald Trump says officials at the White House - which has seen several outbreaks -""should receive the vaccine somewhat later... unless specifically necessary"". According to a 1905 landmark Supreme Court case, states do have it in their power to require the vaccination of their residents. The case, Jacobson v Massachusetts, arose during a smallpox epidemic in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1902 when one resident refused the vaccine. At the time, Cambridge said all residents must get vaccinated or re-vaccinated, otherwise pay a $5 fine (which would be about $150 in 2020). In its ruling, the Supreme Court said that the rights of the individual do not trump the need to ensure public safety. However, the high court of Massachusetts later ruled that states lacked the authority to administer the injection, and could only issue fines. Pennsylvania's health secretary has said they will not issue any mandate, but Virginia's top health official has said they will consider issuing one once the vaccines are ready. Private companies in the US have the right to force their employees to get certain vaccines, experts say, but are unlikely to immediately do so once the vaccine is approved. This is because the vaccines are both seeking approval under an emergency process that critics say could lead to health complications. ""Companies could theoretically issue a mandate, but in the current political climate it is very unlikely they will do so,"" George Washington University Law professor Peter Meyers told Reuters. ""Americans tend to shy away from mandates."" Ford Motor Co and Kellogg Co have both said they will make the vaccine available to their employees on a voluntary basis. Many hospitals and health clinics require annual flu shots, and all 50 states have vaccination requirements in place for school children. Workers can be excused from a vaccine if they have health issues that forbid receiving a vaccine, or - in some states - if they have religious objections. The CDC says that vaccines purchased with taxpayer money will free, but providers may still charge for administering the jab. That fee may be reimbursed by health insurance companies or the Medicaid and Medicare programmes - social safety nets for low income and elderly Americans. In July, the US Department of Health and Human Services announced a $1.95bn (Â£1.45bn) deal to secure 100 million vaccine doses from Pfizer. The agreement also allows the US government to purchase an additional 500 million doses. Moderna received nearly $1bn from the US government for coronavirus research. The company is set to receive an additional $1.5bn for 100 million doses, according to a deal signed in August. Billions of dollars have also been promised to other drug companies in the event that they are able to bring additional vaccines to market. States are also racing to acquire ultra-cold refrigerators that are capable of storing the Pfizer vaccine, which must be kept at temperatures of -70C (-94 F) and is being shipped in packages of dry ice.

"Dame Barbara Windsor, who has died at the age of 83, became the nation's favourite pin-up, the bubbly blonde who packed a lot of personality into her 4ft 10in frame. Her journey from saucy minx in the Carry On films to the matriarch of the Queen Vic in EastEnders made her a national treasure. Her teenage life was troubled. She was rejected by her father, something that drove her into a string of stormy personal relationships. But she went on to be a consummate actress who carved out a successful career on both stage and screen. Actress Dame Barbara Windsor dies aged 83 Mitchell brothers actors pay tribute In pictures: Dame Barbara Windsor Barbara Ann Deeks was born in Shoreditch, east London, on 6 August 1937, the daughter of a fruit and veg street seller and a dressmaker. Her mother Rose had great ambitions for her, paying for elocution lessons in an attempt to lose her cockney accent and move her up the social ladder. Windsor later said her mother's family felt she had married beneath her. A bright child, she sailed though her 11-plus examination. Her mother wanted her to go to university but she persuaded her otherwise by her performance in a school show. Rose spent her savings on a place for Barbara at the Aida Foster School in Golders Green. The teachers took their turn in trying to iron out her cockney accent but all failed. Barbara made her stage debut at the age of 13. Her father John walked out when she was 15 and her mother forced her to give evidence at the divorce hearing, something she never forgot. The unhappiness of her home life drove her to seek solace in a string of casual relationships, which led to her having three abortions by the time she was 21. She had changed her name to Windsor when she appeared in her first film in 1954, as one of the schoolgirls in The Belles of St Trinian's. Her big break came when she joined Joan Littlewood's company at the Theatre Royal in Stratford, east London, appearing in the musical Fings Ain't Wot They Used To Be. Her role as Maggie Gooding in Littlewood's 1963 film Sparrers Can't Sing gained her a Bafta nomination. There were also early roles in TV sitcoms including the BBC's The Rag Trade, which ran for two years from 1961. Windsor (right) with the cast of The Rag Trade in 1962 East End social life saw showbusiness intermingling with local gang culture, and Windsor became friends with the Kray twins and their entourage. She dated Charlie Kray for six months - ""the most perfect gentleman I have ever known"" - and also had a brief relationship with his brother Reggie. With husband Ronnie Knight (left) and Reggie Kray In 1964, she married a small-time criminal, Ronnie Knight, beginning a sometimes stormy union that would last more than 20 years. In the same year, she was cast in Carry On Spying, the ninth film in the successful comedy franchise and the last to be shot in black and white. Her saucy laugh and flirtatious behaviour were perfect for the seaside postcard innuendo on which the success of the films was based. Barbara Windsor as a nurse in Carry On Doctor (1967) But she was adamant that beneath the on-screen character was a serious actress. ""I am not like my image,"" she once said. ""Everyone thinks I just bounce in, but I study and everything has to be just right."" Although she appeared in only a third of the Carry On series, they defined her career and later made it difficult to escape the inevitable typecasting. Arguably her most memorable appearance was in Carry On Camping, when her bikini top flew off during some strenuous physical exercise. The scene had to be shot three times, with the garment being removed by the deft use of a fishing rod in the hands of an off-screen assistant. Barbara had a 10-year affair with Carry On co-star Sid James During her Carry On career she had a 10-year affair with co-star Sid James, which ended just before the actor's death in 1976. It was later portrayed in the ITV drama Cor Blimey!, on which Windsor acted as an advisor. At first, she fended him off, but his infatuation continued. ""I cared deeply for him,"" she recalled. ""I didn't at first, he was just my leading man and I used to push him off. But he was an old-fashioned charmer, opening doors and all the rest of it, making you feel like a lady. So our relationship was inevitable."" In between the Carry On films she continued her stage career, receiving a Tony Award nomination for the Broadway production of Oh! What A Lovely War. She also starred as the music hall performer Marie Lloyd in the biopic Sing a Rude Song, a role she reprised in the BBC series The Good Old Days. In the mid-1970s she toured with her own show, Carry On Barbara, and appeared as Maria in Twelfth Night at Chichester Festival Theatre. But, as she reached her 40s, the image of the bubbly blonde with the sexy wiggle was hampering her ability to get work. ""I found myself in the doldrums in the early 90s. I was too old to play the dolly bird any longer and I looked too young to play a woman of my real age."" She did get the part of the raunchy landlady in a stage production of Joe Orton's black comedy Entertaining Mr Sloane, which was directed by her Carry On co-star Kenneth Williams. Her marriage to Ronnie was coming to an end, after he fled to Spain following his involvement in a multi-million-pound robbery from a security company. In 1994, Dame Barbara was introduced to Albert Square as Peggy Mitchell, mother to Phil (right) and Grant Her career received a major boost in 1994 when she was chosen to play brassy landlady Peggy Mitchell in the BBC soap EastEnders. Ironically, she had spent some of the previous few years pulling pints in a pub in Buckinghamshire that she owned with her second husband, Stephen Hollings. She admitted she had found the idea of EastEnders daunting, joining what was an already well-established drama. ""I was as scared starting on EastEnders as I was when I first stepped on to the Carry On set,"" she later recalled. ""I had to prove myself in a different world."" She based the character of Peggy on Violet Kray, the matriarch of the gang family she had known so well in her youth. On set she found herself acting as a mother figure to many of the soap's young actors, some of whom had no formal training in drama. And at the age of 70, she told one interviewer that she still got a thrill from being wolf-whistled in the street - and made sure she put an extra wiggle in her walk when it happened. A royal visit to the Queen Vic She was forced out of the soap for two years after contracting the debilitating Epstein-Barr virus at the end of 2002, which left her bedridden. There was a brief return in 2004, but she was not well enough to resume the role full-time until the following year. Shortly after picking up a lifetime achievement award at the British Soap Awards, she announced she was quitting EastEnders to spend more time with her third husband, Scott Mitchell. ""I'll be so sad to leave Peggy behind,"" she said at the time. ""She's such a wonderful character to play."" There was also a problem that she withheld from her fans. She had begun finding it hard to learn her lines and she kept repeating certain sentences and stories. After a series of mental agility tests and a brain scan, she was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in 2014. ""I'm so sorry,"" she mouthed to her husband. Two years later she filmed her final scenes as Peggy Mitchell. EastEnders were reluctant to kill off such an iconic character but she rang the producers to insist. In 2009, she was presented with a lifetime achievement award at the British Soap Awards Her husband Scott went to see them to make sure they understood this really was the end. ""Look into my eyes,"" he said. ""She is not coming back."" On set they had an autocue ready but she did not need it. Peggy Mitchell, terminally ill with breast cancer, took a lethal overdose of pills and died in her sleep. In the 2016 New Year's Honours, Barbara was made a dame for her services to charity and entertainment. But soon afterwards, Dame Barbara's Alzheimer's became more difficult to hide. By the time she turned 80 in August 2017, a continual confusion had set in. She became more and more housebound, upset at having to keep her secret from the fans who flocked to her whenever she set foot outside. In May 2018,she made the decision to go public with her conditionand was still well enough to feel overwhelmed by the warmth of the public reaction. Dame Barbara may have retreated from the public gaze but around her friends and family took on the role of campaigning and fundraising for dementia care in her honour. Adam Woodyatt and Jake Wood were among several EastEnders stars who ran the London Marathon in 2019 in a team called Barbara's Revolutionaries. ""It means so much to me to see some of my closest friends coming together to support this cause,"" Dame Barbara said. ""I know it will mean a lot to everyone else living with dementia."" Later that year Dame Barbara put her name to an open letter with her husband calling on the prime minister for a ""long-term funding solution to end the social care crisis"". It coincided with the couple's appointment as ambassadors for the Alzheimer's Society. In July 2020, Dame Barbara's husband had to make the difficult decision to move her into a care home as her condition deteriorated during the coronavirus lockdown. Both on and off-screen Dame Barbara will be remembered as the ""sex-pot with a heart of gold, navigating a complicated and sometimes tumultuous private life"". She enjoyed her successes, faced life's challenges bravely and found happiness in her final marriage to Scott. She was a formidable character actress with a place in British hearts for more than half a century.  And like many of the characters she played, Barbara Windsor was sometimes down, but never out.

"The couple have been married for 20 years Dame Barbara Windsor has moved to a care home in London due to her advancing dementia. Her husbandScott Mitchell told The Sun,externalthe former EastEnders star has been there since mid-July. He said: ""I feel I'm on an emotional rollercoaster. I walk around, trying to keep busy, then burst in to tears. It feels like a bereavement."" Dame Barbara, 82, was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in 2014 and her condition has worsened during lockdown. Dame Barbara appeared in EastEnders until 2016 Scott added: ""It's always been my biggest fear, that one day I would have to take her somewhere and she'd be thinking, 'Why would he do this to me?' ""That fear has become a reality. It's something I never wanted.""

I felt sick in the pit of my stomach that I'd left her. I still feel like that. ""By the time I got home and went to bed, I just felt desperately sad. It's been 27 years since we met and we spent so much of that time in each other's company. It feels like another chapter has gone."" The couple have been married for 20 years. Scott said he had tried to make her room look homely with family and showbiz pictures, including one ofthe actress receiving her damehood from the Queen. This video can not be played Barbara Windsor visited Downing Street last year to highlight the concerns over dementia care The veteran of film and TV was made an MBE in 2000 and a dame in 2015 for services to drama. Dame Barbara appeared in nine Carry On films and played the pub landlord Peggy Mitchell in EastEnders. The actress first appeared on stage at the age of 13 in a pantomime and was soon performing in the West End musical Love From Judy. In 1964 she worked on her first Carry On film - Carry on Spying. She was also in sitcoms including Dad's Army and One Foot in the Grave. Both Dame Barbara and her husband have campaigned to raise awareness of dementia, which is most common in people over the age of 65. Although the former Carry On star was diagnosed in 2014, the couple did not go public with the news until 2018 after her condition worsened. Last year, Dame Barbara and her husband presented Prime Minister Boris Johnson with a petition, organised in collaboration with Alzheimer's Society, highlighting concerns over dementia care. No - dementia is a symptom found in many diseases of the brain. Memory loss is the most common feature of dementia, particularly the struggle to remember recent events. Other symptoms can include changes to behaviour, mood and personality, becoming lost in familiar places or being unable to find the right word in a conversation. It can reach the point where people don't know they need to eat or drink. Alzheimer's disease is by far the most common of the diseases that cause dementia. Others include vascular dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, fronto-temporal dementia, Parkinson's disease dementia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and the newly discovered Late.

"This video can not be played shops Non-essential shops across much of western Scotland - including Glasgow - are reopening for the first time in three weeks. Retailers in the 11 council areas that had been under the country's toughest lockdown rules were able to welcome customers from 06:00. But pubs, cafes and restaurants will have to remain closed until Saturday. It comes as the areas move from level four to level three in the country's tiered system of Covid restrictions. More than two million people had been subject to the level four restrictions since 20 November. BBC Scotland business reporter Andrew Black said Glasgow's Buchanan Street was quite quiet apart from a few delivery vans shortly after 06:00, with many shops choosing not to reopen until an hour or two later. Have the level four restrictions worked? What are the latest Covid rules in Scotland? What level is your council area in? Small queues started to form outside some stores later in the morning. It was hoped that staggering opening times would limit the number of shoppers that would be flocking to the city centre at the same time. Almost half of Scotland's non-essential stores are thought to have been shut by the level four rules, which industry bodies estimated had cost a combined Â£12.5m a day in lost revenues. Three other council areas - Inverclyde, Falkirk and Angus - are moving down from level three to level two from 18:00 on Friday. And both Dumfries and Galloway and the Scottish Borders will be downgraded from level two to level one. There has been controversy over the decision tokeep Edinburgh in level threedespite the city having lower rates of the virus than some level two areas. And opposition parties have described anadditional Â£185m of Scottish government fundingfor businesses hit by Covid restrictions as ""too little, too late"". The centre of Glasgow was busy with shoppers as stores reopened The level four restrictions were imposed in a bid to slow spiralling transmission rates across Glasgow and many of its surrounding areas. All 11 areas have seen case numbers fall since then, but there have been warnings that they could increase again ahead of Christmas unless people continue to be careful and stick to the rules. Strict travel restrictions will remain in place - so it will still be against the law for people outside of Glasgow to travel to the city to do their Christmas shopping, for example. And shoppers have been urged to avoid peak hours and crowded shops, and to consider ordering online or by phone and then collecting in store to limit the amount of time they have to spend in shops. Barbers and hairdressers were among the businesses that had to close under the level four rules Scottish Retail Consortium (SRC) director David Lonsdale said the easing of restrictions would allow shops to ""get back to work, get back to serving their customers and generate some of the revenues they will need to tide themselves over in the leaner months of the new year"". But he said greater clarity was needed from the government over rates relief for the coming year, and proposed a high street voucher scheme to boost consumer spending -similar to the one being developed in Northern Ireland. The Scottish government has said it is considering the voucher idea. Stuart Patrick, the chief executive of Glasgow Chambers of Commerce, warned the picture was still grim for many retailers, especially because of the travel restrictions. He told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""Let's not get too excited - the stranglehold on business may have been loosened but their hands are still pretty firmly around the throats of businesses that employ about 30,000 people in Glasgow city centre."" The changes to the tiers do not come into force until 18:00, meaning hospitality businesses - which must close at that time in level three areas - will not be able to welcome back customers for food and non-alcoholic drinks until Saturday. But retailers that had been closed due to the level four restrictions have been given special permission to open their doors from 06:00 on Friday. The easing of the restrictions will also allow ""close contact"" businesses such as hairdressers, barbers and beauticians to reopen, as well as visitor attractions, outdoor contact sports and training for children. Gyms can also open for individual exercise, but indoor group exercise activities are not allowed - although there is an exemption for under-18s. However, soft play, funfairs, snooker and pool halls, indoor bowling alleys, casinos and bingo halls will remain closed and outdoor live events are banned. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the decline in cases across the level four areas could ""very easily go into reverse"" unless people continued to abide by the rules. She said this was particularly true of the ban on visiting other people's houses - which remains in place across all of mainland Scotland. The first minister added: ""I cannot emphasise enough to you today that the very, very last thing we want to see is overcrowding in or around shops and shopping centres."" The deaths of a further 31 people who had tested positive for the virus were recorded across Scotland on Friday, bringing the total by that measure to 4,070. But data released by the National Records of Scotland on Wednesday showed that a total of 5,868 people have died with confirmed or suspected cases of the virus since the pandemic began. And a total of 104,306 people have now tested positive - 999 of whom are currently in hospital. The 1,001 positive tests recorded in the last 24 hours is the highest daily figure since 26 November. The latest data shows the R number - the average number of people infected by each person with Covid-19 - has fallen further below one, which experts say shows that the restrictions are having the desired effect. The country has also started to vaccinate people with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine after an initial batch of 65,000 doses arrived at the weekend - with more due next week.

The BBCannounced,externalit is dedicating Friday's Evening schedule on BBC One to Dame Barbara ""in loving memory"". It is showingBabsat 19:35 GMT- a dramatisation of her life story - followed by EastEnders at 21:05 GMT. Shane Richie played Alfie 2002 alongside Dame Barbara's Peggy in the soap Dame Barbara was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in 2014 and hadmoved to a care home earlier this year. She appeared in nine films in the Carry On comedy series, plus Sparrows Can't Sing, for which she was nominated for a Bafta, as well as parts in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and On the Fiddle with Sir Sean Connery. She was well-known to millions of TV viewers for her portrayal of landlady Peggy Mitchell in EastEnders, starring alongside her on-screen children Ross Kemp and Steve McFadden. This video can not be played Some of Dame Barbara Windsor's highlights as Peggy Mitchell Her last appearance in the soap came in 2016, the same year she was made a dame for her services to charity and entertainment. She also worked in theatre - making her stage debut at 13 - and appeared in productions including Oh! What A Lovely War and Fings Ain't Wot They Used To Be. The moment you met her, she had an ability to make you feel like an old friend.  She was funny, warm and engagingly open, she would arrive in a room and bring with her a little ripple of warmth. And the character you saw on TV and film was remarkably close to the person you would chat to before and after an interview.  She was from a generation of working-class actors who had got their break in the 60s when theatre directors like Joan Littlewood were looking for talent that seemed real and natural on stage and screen. That's not to say she wasn't also tough and canny enough to know how to turn on the charm.  Her life was a story filled with gangsters, set backs and determination to succeed. She had decided to act when she was a child and there was behind the laughter the sort of steel you need to have a career that lasts nearly 70 years.  There was a definitely something of her character in the tough EastEnders landlady, Peggy Mitchell. But she was always open about her ups and downs, she didn't hide the flaws and vulnerabilities, which only made her all the more likeable. After her dementia diagnosis, Dame Barbara became an ambassador for the Alzheimer's Society andmet Mr Johnson to raise awareness about the disease. The star delivered a letter signed by 100,000 people pleading for better care for people affected by dementia and saying the system was ""completely inadequate, unfair, unsustainable and in dire need of more money"". Dame Barbara Windsor married Scott Mitchell in 2000 Mr Mitchell, who campaigned alongside his wife, said of her death: ""It was not the ending that Barbara or anyone else living with this very cruel disease deserve. ""I will always be immensely proud of Barbara's courage, dignity and generosity dealing with her own illness and still trying to help others by raising awareness for as long as she could."" The couple went public with her diagnosis in 2018 and Mr Mitchell had said they had been ""really nervous"" about revealing she was affected by the condition. In his statement he thanked the public, family and friends for support which he said ""Barbara deeply appreciated"". He added: ""I've lost my wife, my best friend and soul mate and my heart or life will never feel the same without you."" The Alzheimer's Society said it was ""incredibly grateful"" to Dame Barbara and her husband for their work bringing awareness to the disease. In a statement, the charity said: ""Dame Barbara Windsor was an amazingly true, much-loved national treasure, and in speaking out about her experiences shone like a beacon for others affected by dementia."" Like her EastEnders character, Dame Barbara was born in east London, in Shoreditch in 1937. She married three times,including to small-time criminal Ronnie Knight, and she also dated gangster Charlie Kray and his brother Reggie. The actress married Mr Mitchell in 2000, with the pair having first met in 1992. If you, or someone you know, has been affected by dementia you can find more information and supporthere.
