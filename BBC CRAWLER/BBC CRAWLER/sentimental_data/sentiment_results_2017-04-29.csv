"Maria Sharapova was suspended in March 2016 after testing positive for meldonium Maria Sharapova suffered a first defeat since returning from a 15-month doping ban as Kristina Mladenovic beat her in the semi-finals of the Stuttgart Open. Five-time Grand Slam winner Sharapova, 30, was up a set and a break but squandered it to lose 3-6 7-5 6-4. Mladenovic, 23, faces German Laura Siegemund in Sunday's final. Having been given a wildcard entry, Russian Sharapova needed to reach the final in Germany to be eligible for qualifying for the French Open. Her defeat means she will be outside the top 200 when the rankings are released on Monday, so she will need a wildcard to compete in qualifying or the main draw in the event in Paris, which starts on 28 May. She will learn on 16 May whether she will be given a wildcard for either stage at Roland Garros. Kristina Mladenovic is in the Stuttgart Open final for the first time Sharapova, who has also received wildcards for forthcoming tournaments in Madrid and Rome, took complete control at the start of the contest as a second double fault gave her a 4-1 lead before sealing the first set in just 38 minutes. She broke Mladenovic again at the start of the second set and looked to be cruising to victory, but despite conceding 11 double faults, the Frenchwoman improved her baseline game and fought her way back into the contest. The world number 19 broke back and then held her composure to survive three break points to go 6-5 ahead before converting her first set point on Sharapova's next service game. The pair traded blows early in the third before Mladenovic grabbed a break to go 4-2 up and fought back from 0-40 to hold her serve. Sharapova rallied to pull it back to 5-4, but Mladenovic was not to be denied her first win over the Russian and converted her first match point. BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller: The pressure told on Sharapova as the match got tighter - as you would expect it to after 15 months away. Mladenovic's second serve was very vulnerable, but she showed huge heart to save 13 of 16 break points. This has still been a very encouraging week for the former world number one: she will be just outside the top 250 when her name returns to the rankings on Monday and could yet make the cut for Wimbledon's main draw. That will depend on how well she plays in Madrid and Rome and another semi-final appearance in either of those events might just do the trick.

"This video can not be played Moyes 'feels' for Sunderland fans after relegation Sunderland manager David Moyes said it was ""too soon"" for him to commit to the club for next season, following their relegation from the Premier League. The Black Cats' 10-season spell in the top flight ended when theylost 1-0 at home to Bournemouthon Saturday andHull City drew 0-0 at Southampton. Moyes, who took charge at Sunderland in July last year, hasfaced calls from supporters to step down. ""I think it's a question for two or three weeks' time,"" said the Scot. ""I think we all need to reflect and look at everything from top to bottom."" What next for 'worn-down' Moyes? Listen - Shearer: 'I fear for relegated Sunderland' Chairman Ellis Short,who has been trying to sell the club,,externalapologised to Sunderland fans, and admitted mistakes had been made. Since Short bought the club in 2009,external- he became chairman in 2011 - the Black Cats have had seven full-time managers, but have faced the threat of relegation in almost every season. ""We need to improve both on and off the field, and despite the bitter disappointment there is a strong determination to do so throughout the club,"" said the American. ""There is significant work to be done over the summer and when the season is concluded, we intend to share our plans to move forward with our supporters."" Listen as fans react to Sunderland's relegation on 606 Were Sunderland right to stand by Moyes? 2011-12 Steve Bruce sacked, replaced by Martin O'Neill Survived 2012-13 O'Neill sacked, replaced by Paolo di Canio Survived 2013-14 Di Canio sacked, replaced by Gus Poyet Survived 2014-15 Poyet sacked, replaced by Dick Advocaat Survived 2015-16 Advocaat resigns, replaced by Sam Allardyce Survived 2016-17 David Moyes replaces Allardyce before season Relegated This is the first time Moyes has been relegated as a manager, and he warned fans just two games into the the season that hethought they would struggle. ""I feel for the supporters because they're the people who pay their hard-earned cash to come and watch and we've not given them enough this season,"" said the former Everton and Manchester United manager. ""I've had 400-odd games in the Premier League and I've got an idea of what a good squad looks like. ""My feeling at the start of the season was it was going to be a hard graft, and I'd rather be up front with people than tell them something different."" The defeat by Bournemouth was the ninth time Sunderland have failed to score in their past 10 games, and the 18th time they have failed to do so this season. Jermain Defoe, the team's top scorer this season with 14, has not found the net in more than 15 hours of Premier League football. ""We've needed Jermain's goals,"" said Moyes. ""At times we haven't given him enough quality supply. But there has been other times, like today, when a couple of chances came. In the early part of the season he was getting them and finishing them."" Moyes was given the Sunderland job afterSam Allardyceleft for his brief stint as England manager. He has not been helped by injuries, with Jan Kirchhoff, Lee Cattermole, Duncan Watmore, Jordan Pickford, Paddy McNair and Victor Anichebe among the first-team players to have had lengthy spells on the sidelines. Short said: ""I acknowledge that during my ownership mistakes have been made, particularly in the area of player recruitment, and as a result we have found ourselves struggling to survive in recent seasons. ""We had massive disruption during the summer transfer window, and an unprecedented number of injuries throughout the season. ""These are difficulties which we have been unable to overcome and we are paying the price for that now."" This video can not be played Sunderland relegation a 'terrible' feeling Match of the Day pundit and former Newcastle striker Alan Shearer: David Moyes has got to take responsibility as has the owner. It's been a disastrous season from start to finish. Mismanagement at all levels and they've signed some poor players. They've been flirting with relegations for a number of seasons and it was inevitable it was going to happen. A Â£28m net spend in the last three transfer windows is comparable with teams in and around them, but I worry for Sunderland. There are two players that are assets in that team [Jordan Pickford and Jermain Defoe]. Other than that there's not too much in that squad that's worth a lot of money. Match of the Day commentator John Motson: A club badly managed from above for the last four years. At least three managers have got them out of it at the end of the season. The rot set in at Sunderland a long time ago and it came right from the top. I have no sympathy with them - they deserved to do down. I just hope somebody, whether it's David Moyes - a new owner perhaps - has got the opportunity to bring them back. They have been a great club, they've got great fans but I'm afraid the way the club has been run, they've deserved what they got. Former Premier League striker Jason Roberts: Those Sunderland fans are seeing a team and a club that I think has lacked leadership from the boardroom. That's why they have skipped from manager to manager with no real plan or identity. Maybe they need to go down, refocus, bring in some young hungry players and give a new ""project"" to the Premier League because Sunderland are a huge club and if they come back up next season, they will be a club many will fear.

"Wladimir Klitschko suffered the fifth defeat of his career Joshua v Klitschko re-run Listen to the fight again onBBC Radio 5 live sports extrafrom 06:00-10:00 BST on Sunday. Anthony Joshua produced the performance of his career to add the WBA world heavyweight title to his IBF crown with an enthralling knockout win over Wladimir Klitschko at Wembley Stadium. A post-war record 90,000 fans at the national stadium were treated to a see-saw contest, Joshua dropping the former unified world champion in the fifth round, before being put down - for the first time in his 19-fight career - in the sixth. Both men looked in danger of being stopped over two rounds which will live long in the memory, before Joshua delivered the clinical blows in the 11th. The Briton landed a brutal uppercut which gave him the platform to send Klitschko down with an immediate flurry. This video can not be played The thrilling finale of Joshua v Klitschko (UK only) The Ukrainian stood, was dropped by a left hook again moments later, then stood again, only for referee David Fields to save him when pinned against the ropes. Joshua threw his arms into the air as roars rolled down the Wembley tiers. He had come through his stiffest test to date, while Klitschko too had answered questions, showing he remains competitive at world level, even at 41. He will rue not finishing the job when he floored Joshua and appeared tantalisingly close to reclaiming two of the titles he lost in his last fight against Tyson Fury in 2015. At the time of the stoppage, Joshua was up 96-93 and 95-93 on two cards, with Klitschko leading 95-93 on the other. Listen to the thrilling finale Fury accepts Joshua's challenge Analysis: Joshua's bright future 5 live podcast: Joshua-Klitschko reaction Relive Joshua's stunning victory After lengthy ring walks, fireworks, deafening noise and a rousing British national anthem, an opening six minutes of skill over power played out. Klitschko flicked his jab, his left hand waving in front of Joshua's face. Feints from both men stood out as they hunted openings. A solid right hand early in the fourth caught Joshua, who responded with the same shot later in the round, nodding at his rival on the bell. And then came the power punching in a pulsating fifth round. Joshua shook his man before sending him down face first with a flurry of punches. The crowd sensed blood, urging the Briton forward, only for Klitschko - cut above his left eye - to show the heart which has made him the most dominant heavyweight of the 21st century. He pinned Joshua to the ropes, turning the round on its head, and then came out in the sixth to administer an overhand right which crumpled the champion. In uncharted waters, Joshua answered the count and faced a stiff examination before the bell. This was now an epic, living up to the hype, heavyweight boxing at its most captivating. The pace dropped, it had to, though any fear of Joshua's career-high weight slowing him down was unceremoniously put to bed in the 11th as his power unified the titles. The sweat flew from Klitschko's head as the telling uppercut landed crushingly, before Joshua hunted down his opponent to seal a historic win. Wladimir Klitschko suffered the fifth defeat of his career Less than three years ago, Joshua fought here low down the Froch-Groves undercard, but 13 fights later he stood centre stage, seeking a win promoter Eddie Hearn said would make him ""the biggest star in British sport"". Hearn, a bevy of global sponsors and a sizeable entourage have backed and built the Joshua brand - investment which looks stunningly astute on a night when his reputation was further enhanced. Through his litany of knockout wins there have been question marks. Could he withstand punishment? Did he have the skills to match a world-level fighter? He answered emphatically, complementing solid technique early on with resistance when troubled and brutal power down the stretch. This bout was televised by two networks in the US, only the third time in history such a deal has been struck, and the Las Vegas fight nights enjoyed by Lennox Lewis - the last undisputed heavyweight champion - look to be on the cards. The wild celebrations of those closest to him underlined just what this meant. A man carrying a huge weight of expectation had delivered. Defiance has poured from Klitschko in recent months. The Ukrainian has compared himself to Everest, talked of an ""obsession"" in bouncing back from defeat by Fury, and preached about his peaceful state of mind as challenger, not champion. Such a steely demeanour hinted retirement in the short term was out of the question, and he is understood to still have three fights left on a contract with German broadcaster RTL. He looked a different fighter to the one beaten by Fury, and markedly better than in his latest points win over Bryant Jennings, but the size of his task was huge. He was the underdog with bookmakers, with only George Foreman having won a recognised world title past the age of 40. The trademark jab and power right hand were on show, as was guts aplenty in getting up three times. And, despite losing the richest bout in British boxing history - with an estimated Â£30m pot shared by the fighters, it is clear the fire still burns. Anthony Joshua has stopped all 19 of his opponents as a professional If you are viewing this page on the BBC News app please visit theBBC Sport website,externalto see more images from the fight. Joshua on BBC Radio 5 live:""I knew it was possible to hurt him, but I am learning round by round. I'm learning under the bright lights. ""I don't come to box, I come to hurt people. With all due respect, I came to hurt him. ""At the end of the day, I figured out what I had to do and got him done. ""I'm coming back to Wembley. I'll look forward to seeing you here again. ""There's been many a time in training when we go into the 11th round and I'm tired but I know I have to keep it up because I have to go the distance. ""I showed tonight that fights are won in the gym. It gets tough and boxing isn't easy. You have to have the whole package."" Hollywood actor Arnold Schwarzenegger tweeted a shot from his ringside seat BBC Radio 5 live boxing commentator Ronald McIntosh ""What an epic display of determination and guts from both fighters. ""Joshua was put on the floor for the first time in his career and he got through that test. ""We have to ask, is it the end of the road for Klitschko or do we want to see it again?"" Former world champion Richie Woodhall ""There comes a time in a boxer's life where no amount of training or sparring will help. ""There comes a time where it comes from within. It is DNA, or whatever you want to call it. ""Those punches came from the depths of his soul.""

"This video can not be played Joshua & Klitschko face off before heavyweight boxing showdown Anthony Joshua v Wladimir Klitschko Date:Saturday, 29 AprilVenue:Wembley StadiumTime:22:00 BST Coverage:Live commentary on BBC Radio 5 live from 21:00 BST and text updates on the BBC Sport website and app from 19:30 BST So much hype, so much on the line, so many opinions. Around 90,000 people will pack into Wembley Stadium on Saturday to see IBF heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua attempt to add the vacant WBA belt to his collection when he faces the division's once dominant force Wladimir Klitschko. A 14-year age gap between the 27-year-old Briton and a fighter he once assisted as a sparring partner means some pundits have styled the bout as apprentice meets master. But it's Joshua who starts as odds-on favourite. Does he justify that status? BBC Sport asked some familiar faces from the world of boxing about how they see things shaping up and, of course, we want your verdict too. In a BBC Sport poll, 72% of voters think that Anthony Joshua will win on Saturday. This video can not be played Perfect time for Anthony Joshua to fight Klitschko - Lennox Lewis Lennox Lewis, the last man to be undisputed heavyweight champion, told BBC Radio 5 live:""Now is the perfect time for Joshua, because Wladimir Klitschko has a chink in his armour in getting beaten by Tyson Fury. ""With the age aspect of Klitschko, he doesn't have the legs, the power that he used to. There are a lot of different factors going on in his life as well. ""I believe Joshua is more focused. Does he want to be undisputed champion? Absolutely."" Did you know? Lewis, Joshua and Klitschko all won Olympic gold but only Joshua and the late Joe Frazier became world champions while still Olympic champion. Joshua has won all 18 of his professional fights, while Klitschko has 64 wins and four losses Former world super-middleweight champion Richie Woodhall:""Klitschko controls the fight better when people are going to him. He's a master at adjusting his feet and keeping a gap, an absolute master. ""I think the victory for Joshua will come by boxing at a distance and making Klitschko come forward. ""I see Joshua winning the fight in the mid to late rounds, around the seventh or eighth. I think Joshua will stop him eventually and catch him with a solid shot. ""At 41, you have to ask how long Klitschko can go on at this level. It will take a hell of a performance to beat Joshua, who I don't think will come out swinging, but will box intelligently. If he goes wading in, he could walk in to a trap."" Did you know? Joshua has spent less than two hours in the ring as a professional on his way to 18 knockout wins in 18 fights. Listen: 'Joshua has only ever lost one round' Tony Bellew Joshua was seven when Klitschko made his professional debut Former super-middleweight world champion Carl Froch,who beat George Groves at Wembley Stadium in 2014:""This is Joshua's first real test at world level. This is his acid test and against a veteran who can punch, box and move to survive when he needs to. ""I think Joshua will be nervous. Wembley Stadium will add to those nerves and I don't think they will help him. I don't think he will enjoy it like I did. Purely because there is a lot of pressure on him - he's expected to win and has this massive task. ""He needs to try and enjoy it. They say cometh the hour cometh the man. He really needs to switch on and live up to what everyone expects of him."" Did you know? Joshua's weight of 17st 12lbs is the heaviest of his career to date. Tyson Fury pulled off one of the great boxing upsets when he beat Klitschko in November 2015 Peter Fury, who trained nephew Tyson to beat Klitschko, told BBC Radio 5 live:""Klitschko probably folds his bed sheets a certain way. So what do you give someone who is a perfectionist? Give him everything he hates. Upset his rhythm, fire shots from all angles. ""I think it's too soon for Joshua. I think his boxing skills leave a lot to be desired. I think he gets hit far too easy, especially with the jab. On a world level you can't be open like that. ""I think a lot of it is inexperience. Ultimately if you've got a leaky defence in the heavyweight division, I don't care if you have dynamite in both hands, you are coming unstuck sooner or later."" Did you know? Klitschko has knocked out 53 of his 68 opponents.

Quiz:Which heavyweight great are you? Klitschko's jab followed by a thumping right hand has become a trademark weapon Former two-weight world champion Paulie Malignaggi:""It's a matter of how much Klitschko has left. At his age, it's probably not a good thing to have had a long lay-off. If he has anything left, he can trouble Joshua. The flicking of the jab, following it with the right hand - it can hurt Joshua, who doesn't have a lot of head movement. ""I think Joshua is going to try to take it to Klitschko and be the boss. Joshua will try to counter the jab with his own right hand. In the end, I think youth will be too much, but Klitschko does have that dynamite right hand."" Did you know? Klitschko could become one of the oldest world heavyweight champions, though George Foreman leads the way, capturing the honour aged 45. This video can not be played Klitschko records Joshua fight prediction on USB Former world heavyweight champion Vitali Klitschko told BBC Radio 5 live:""I've never seen my brother so concentrated. ""I want to say that Joshua is a great fighter, and has great skills, but he has never been at such a high level. He looks relaxed, like it will be easy. It will not be. ""Everyone has weaknesses; Wladimir's is his concentration. If he is 100% concentrated, Joshua has no chance. Ask me about speed, power, experience, Wladimir is better."" Did you know? Vitali had three spells as world heavyweight champion. Wladimir has two to his name so far. This video can not be played Joshua has left 'no stone unturned' for Klitschko fight BBC Radio 5 live analyst Steve Bunce:""I don't think Joshua can outbox Klitschko. I want to see a little bit of nerves, I want to see him sucking in some air, I want to see some sort of fear. If we don't see that then whisper it, it makes him almost inhuman. ""Can Wladimir look like any of the old Wladimirs? Even a bad old Wladimir should be enough to beat this kid Anthony Joshua. I think an awful lot has been placed on the assumption, the dream, the hope, that Wladimir at 41 has nothing left. If that's not the case then we are in for a tricky night. ""Joshua used his brain at the Olympics. That side of his game is there. Has he enough brain against a decent Klitschko?"" Did you know? Anthony Joshua only took up boxing in 2007, five years prior to his Olympic win. He had athletic pedigree though and ran 11.6 seconds for 100m aged 14. This video can not be played Wilder tips Klitschko to beat Joshua WBC world heavyweight champion Deontay Wilder:""My heart is with Joshua, my mind is with Klitschko. I think experience will play its part. With experience you've seen things before and are more able to capitalise when you face them again. ""Can you pull the trigger? Can your body react as fast as you see it? That's the only thing with Klitschko. Sometimes age is nothing but a number and it's about what's in your head."" Did you know? Klitschko weighed in 5lbs lighter than when he lost to Tyson Fury in 2015. Joshua has lived at his Sheffield-based training camp throughout his preparations Promoter Eddie Hearn told BBC Radio 5 live:""There is a chance in this fight Joshua could be completely out of his depth. And there is a chance he goes out there and is the fighter we believe he is and he dismantles Klitschko. ""I love Klitschko because he's a competitor. To tame the young lion would probably be the greatest night of his career. ""If Joshua wins he becomes the biggest star in British sport and in the world of boxing.""

"Food blogger Jack Monroe will stand as a candidate for the National Health Action (NHA) Party in the forthcoming general election, she has confirmed. The writer and activist will run in the Southend West constituency in her first campaign to become an MP. Last month,Ms Monroe successfully sued columnist Katie Hopkins for defamationover two tweets published in 2015, and was awarded Â£24,000 in damages. On Twitter,external, she thanked Ms Hopkins for being her ""campaign sponsor"". Ms Monroe tweeted that her fear of meeting new people would make the general election ""a huge personal challenge on every level"". But she added: ""Some things are bigger than me, so today I'm digging deep."" Responding to Twitter users suggesting that she will lose her deposit, Ms Monroe wrote: ""I may well do, but you should be directing your glee to my campaign sponsor, Katie. ""Because nothing feels more right than using money earned through division and hate, to instead promote unity, community, and care. ""So from the bottom of my heart, thank you Katie for your generous - if unwitting - contribution to saving the National Health Service."" The NHA grew from a campaign group opposing the 2012 Health and Social Care Act.

"This video can not be played ""It might not be the stuff of sound bites, but I've always believed in... empowering others."" Jeremy Corbyn has defended his style of leadership, saying other party leaders had given in to vested interests and manipulated the public. The Labour leader told supporters Prime Minister Theresa May was developing a ""presidential bunker mentality"". Mr Corbyn said he believes in ""empowering others to make up their minds"" instead. He also used the speech to urge young people to vote, saying apathy would hand seats to the Conservatives. In what has been described as his most personal speech of the election campaign, he said that ""if leaders go unchallenged, they can make some of the most damaging mistakes"". ""If party leaders put themselves ahead of serving the people, they stop listening and even put our country at risk,"" he told supporters in East London. ""Barely nine months into Theresa May's premiership, there are clear warning signs that she and her closest advisers are slipping into that presidential bunker mentality. ""Whereas it is the job of leadership to hold open the space for dissent, new thinking and fit-for-purpose policy. ""So while it might not be the stuff of sound bites, I have always believed in standing firm and empowering others to make up their minds and come on board when they are ready."" Theresa May urges Scottish voters to 'strengthen Union' UKIP leader Paul Nuttall to stand in Boston and Skegness Mr Corbyn said while political leaders had to give in to ""vested interests"", he did not want to be like that. ""It wasn't clear to me there could be another way,"" he said. ""But I've learned there is. Whereas insecure leaders want to feel stronger by asking you to give them more power, I recognise strong leadership as equipping you with more power."" Actress Maxine Peake was among those in attendance for the speech The Islington North MP said it was vital young people register to vote, telling them they should ""step up"" and ""claim the future"". He said 2.4 million people are missing from the UK's electoral register and pointed out that barely 40% of 18-24 year olds vote, adding that Conservatives are more than happy with this and ""apathy and resignation"" will secure them seats in the election. Asked if it would be a bad performance for the party if they do not win, and if he does not become prime minister, he replied: ""I'm going all over the country, and you know what? - the printed papers say one thing but the mood on the street tells me something very, very different. ""There's a positive energy and a positive anger out there. ""People are fed up - they are fed up with not being able to get somewhere to live, they are fed up with waiting for hospital appointments, they are fed up with zero hours contracts, they are fed up with low pay, they are fed up with debt, they are fed up with not being able to get on in their lives because of a system that's rigged against them."" He used the speech to highlight his political career, including his activism against apartheid in South Africa and in support of Nelson Mandela in the 1980s. He also referred to his maiden speech in 1983, when he criticised Tory cuts to public services, and said it was a ""tragedy"" that such a speech would hold true today. Actress Maxine Peake was among those in the audience for Saturday's speech. In response to Mr Corbyn's comments, Conservative Party chairman Sir Patrick McLoughlin said: ""Jeremy Corbyn can promise anything but we all know he can't deliver. His nonsensical speech today demonstrated that he is just not up to it."" His speech comes asMrs May spoke in Scotlandin her first campaign visit there, asking Scots to vote for her to ""strengthen the Union"". Meanwhile, the Lib Dem's Tim Farron has said he wants to become the leader of the opposition when the UK goes to the polls on 8 June.

"Margaret Thatcher lost a number of senior colleagues who objected to her manner of governing The soundbites are constantly repeated. ""Strong leader"". ""Strong and stable leadership"". ""Strong and stable government"". But what do they mean? At first glance the terms are not contentious. It is easy to get agreement that ""what we need is a strong leader"", and few would argue that ""what we need is a weak leader"". Yet, there is a lot to be said against an over-mighty leader. If what we mean by a ""strong leader"", as we usually do, is one who maximises his or her power and takes most of the big decisions, that is far from the same as effective leadership. More dispersed power among colleagues of high political standing will lead to better-informed decisions and guard against an individual leader listening only to people who are beholden to him or her and too ready to agree with the leader. The immediate post-war Labour prime minister, Clement Attlee, is these days often seen as the instigator and driving force of a series of major policies that reshaped British society - such as the creation of the NHS. But this was a government in which individual ministerial responsibility and collective cabinet responsibility were realities and Mr Attlee neither dominated the policy process nor tried to do so. He believed in collective leadership - accepting that his colleagues ""may perhaps be wiser than oneself"". His achievement was to keep together a team of people whose major figures differed sharply with each other. In the classic definition of the term, Mr Attlee was not a strong leader, yet he headed a strong and stable government. Clement Attlee had a quiet and unassuming personality that led many to underestimate him The government over which Mr Attlee presided from 1945 to 1951, and that led by Margaret Thatcher from 1979 to 1990, were the two post-war administrations that made the biggest difference to this country. In that sense, they were both strong governments. Each of them essentially set the political agenda for a generation. Many of the policies of the post-war Labour government remained in place until they were reversed by the Thatcher government, which was led in a completely different style from Mr Attlee's. Mrs Thatcher was, indeed, a dominating prime minister and she succeeded in implementing controversial policies. She lost, however, a series of senior colleagues who objected to her manner of governing, and it was that overweening style which led ultimately to her being ousted by members of her own cabinet and parliamentary party. In contrast, Mr Attlee led the contentious Labour party for 20 years, retiring as leader at the age of 72. Leaders who seek to gather more power in their office seldom stop to ponder that their successor, who may have a very different agenda, will inherit these same powers. Thus, Ed Miliband, as Labour leader, persuaded the parliamentary Labour party to give up electing the shadow cabinet and accord him as leader of the opposition the power to appoint them. In reality, voters can only give their backing to the leaders if they stand in their constituencies As a backbencher, Jeremy Corbyn strongly opposed that change, but once he inherited those powers, he refused to return them to Labour MPs, even when they voted overwhelmingly last year to take them back. Yet, keeping that extra power in the leader's hands illustrates the difference between a ""strong leader"" and a ""strong leadership"". Although Mr Corbyn would then have less power individually, a leadership chosen by the parliamentary party would be stronger in its political composition and, arguably, in its appeal to the electorate. Election questions, answered The seats that could decide the election Prime ministers, still more than leaders of the opposition, have shown a growing desire to set themselves apart from their senior colleagues. They are encouraged to do so by their aides, for the more decisions are taken in the prime minister's office, the more influence and de facto power adheres to these closest advisers. Theresa May took personalisation of power a rhetorical step further in the House of Commons this week when she repeatedly said that ""a vote for me and the Conservative candidate"" in the 8 June election will lead to strong and stable leadership and a better Brexit outcome. This video can not be played The prime minister sticks relentlessly to her ""strong and stable"" slogan The reality is that Mrs May's name will appear on the ballot paper only in her Maidenhead constituency. Although some voters do vote for or against a party on the basis of what they think of the leader, a parliamentary election is not a presidential election. It is still, above all, a choice, with varying degrees of enthusiasm, of one political party in preference to others. The Conservative party won the 1970 general election at a time when Harold Wilson was significantly more popular than Edward Heath. And even though Labour leader James Callaghan's personal popularity rating was 20 points ahead of Mrs Thatcher's on the eve of the 1979 poll, the Conservatives won that contest. At the time, Mr Callaghan was more popular than was his party, Margaret Thatcher less popular than hers. By 1983, after the Falklands War, Mrs Thatcher polled ahead of her party. The choice of a government is much more than the choice of a prime minister. The greatly respected political scientist and TV election analyst Anthony King, who died in January, observed last year that the best-governed countries ""owe their good government in large part to the fact that their political institutions and political culture obviate the need for strong leaders"". He concluded: ""A successful liberal democracy is liable to be one that is effectively ""leader-proofed"", one in which... it is made difficult for a strong leader to acquire and wield power and in which the government does not rely on strong leaders for its long-term success"". He was surely right. Archie Brown is the author of The Myth of the Strong Leader: Political Leadership in the Modern Age 'Strong and stable' - had enough yet?

"Mr Nuttall said it was an ""honour"" to stand in the constituency UKIP leader Paul Nuttall is to stand in Boston and Skegness in Lincolnshire in June's General Election. Announcing his bid on Saturday, he said the seat voted ""overwhelmingly"" for Leave in the EU referendum last year. The constituency, held by the Conservatives in 2015 with UKIP second, recorded the highest Leave vote, with 75.6% choosing to leave the EU. Mr Nuttall said he would make it his ""mission"" to ""ensure there is no backsliding on Brexit"". He had said on Fridaythat he would do his ""duty to lead the party into battle"" and stand for election, but at that time refused to confirm speculation he would stand in the Lincolnshire constituency. Mr Nuttall had been due to make a speech in Hartlepool on Saturday as part of the election campaign, but a party spokesman said it had been cancelled due to ""unforeseen circumstances"". Police said two women, aged 28 and 62,were arrested on suspicion of assault after an altercation broke outas supporters of the party waited for Mr Nuttall to arrive. The party leader said: ""It is a great honour and a privilege to stand for UKIP in Boston and Skegness. ""The constituency voted overwhelmingly for Leave inspired in part by the massive betrayal of our fishing industry by successive governments, something that today's Conservative Party led by Theresa May looks set to repeat. ""I will make it my mission to stand up for the people of Boston and Skegness and ensure there is no backsliding on Brexit."" Mr Nuttall has said UKIP would be ""standing in the vast majority of the country"", but that he had asked ""a number"" of branches to consider not standing in areas currently represented by prominent Leave campaigners from all parties, if they were at risk from a challenge by a pro-Remain candidate. His predecessor Nigel Farage would ""play a front-of-house role in this election"", Mr Nuttall has said. He said he believed the party was ""in with a chance of winning a number of seats at this election"". Conservative MP Matt Warmanwon the seat of Boston and Skegness with a majority of more than 4,000in the last election. UKIP won 3.9m votes in 2015, which resulted in only one seat.

"How did we go so wrong as a nation that something the baby boomer generation took for granted - being able to buy a decent-sized family home - now appears out of reach for so many of their children? That's the question I was trying to answer in Liverpool this week as part of the Today programme's series of reports on big election issues. Housing is one of them, for obvious reasons: the gap between the number of new homes needed in England and those available is estimated at 100,000 a year. While our politicians are quick to acknowledge the problem, it's far less clear if the solutions they propose will deliver change on the required scale. In the meantime,the experience of 33-year-old Michael Sergison tells a bigger story. At first glance he appears to have everything going for him; he and his new wife both have stable jobs - his in a Liverpool lettings agency, hers in a local hospital. But for the last few years, they've been living with his parents, trying to save enough for a deposit on a house. Recently married Michael Sergison is struggling to find an affordable house to buy in Merseyside After they got married last month, that situation no longer felt right. ""We wanted to move out. Not straight away, but as a married couple we feel as if we should be on our own, rather than with my mum and dad."" Having spent a lot of their savings on their wedding in Las Vegas last month, the only option was to rent. The day I met Michael he was in the process of moving into a one-bedroom flat, with his father, also Michael Sergison, helping him out. Michael Senior is quick to reflect on the contrast between his son's situation and what he could do at the same age: he and his wife paid Â£10,500 for their first home, a three-bedroom semi, in 1978. The home that Michael Junior and his wife Francine dream of buying in Liverpool is upwards of Â£200,000: on a combined salary of Â£40,000 per annum, they could be years away from it. Labour pledges to build 1m new homes More affordable housing promised in White Paper Where can I afford to live? For now, they're out of his parents' home and into one that belongs to someone else - his landlady Sue Earle, whose experience of the housing market also tells a bigger story. She is a buy-to-let investor and sees the flat as a way to safeguard her future. ""I own two properties with my brother, which we purchased just to rent out. ""We both have successful careers, but we felt we needed to make sure that we have additional funds when we retire."" She hopes the rental income, of about Â£530 per month, will pay off the mortgage within ten years. After that, she could continue to let the flat out, or sell it at a profit. Sue says she knows what it's like to have to save for a deposit, and worked hard to build up the funds that enabled her three mortgages. For Michael, it's all about that first step on the housing ladder, for which his work at the lettings agency is not only crucial to his earnings, but also a valuable insight into the property market. The Council of Mortgage Lenders says that the UK's housing market is in ""neutral gear"" His manager at Belvoir Sales & Lettings, Adam Rastall, thinks the government should look at particular points where the market seizes up. ""I would focus more on the OAPs and the baby boomers and look for appropriate and suitable housing for them in the future. ""If we can help the older generation find suitable accommodation and give them incentives to move, then that would free up some good-quality housing for the younger generation."" I thought immediately of the older Michael Sergison, who has just retired from his work as a pipe-fitter and is living with his wife in a four-bedroom house. But downsizing? Not a chance. ""It's not our fault. When you get to a certain age you think 'why should I?' he explained to me. ""Whatever incentive they offered me, it just wouldn't work.  I'm quite happy where I am."" Not surprisingly, Michael Senior wants to enjoy the house - and garden - that is the fruit of his own working life. He looks around his son's one-bedroom flat and struggles to imagine it as home. ""I couldn't live in this. I'd go stir crazy,"" he says. But he knows this is the reality for many thousands of younger people. As far as the younger Michael is concerned, he's looking to the future, satisfied to be making the right start to married life. ""I'm happy that we've got a place to call our own. It's not our house or our flat, but we'll make it our home.""

" The landscape of Nepal is a geographical staircase, descending from snow-capped Himalayan mountains, through steep middle hills, to the lush flat plains of the south. In the middle step, in the remote far west of the country, life has changed little over the decades. For 18-year-old Ishwari Joshi, this means doing as her mother and grandmother did before her and leaving her home when she has her period. The practice is called “chhaupadi” - a name for menstruation which also conveys the meaning that a woman is unclean when she is bleeding. “The first time I had my period I was 15. I had to stay out for nine days,” she says. Ishwari's village Dhamilekh clings to an exposed hillside, commanding breathtaking views of high mountains and a low green valley criss-crossed by two rivers. Google Maps About 100 families live here, snugly squeezed together in three-storey, mud-plastered houses. Cattle sleep on the ground floor, families on the middle, while the top floor is used for cooking. When a woman starts her period, she has to leave this warmth for the seclusion of a specially built hut. These are tiny spaces, shared by several families, without proper beds or bedding. When the women are isolated here, they can't cook, eat nutritious food, drink from or bathe in the village water source. They are forbidden from touching plants, cattle or men. “It is said that if we touch a cow, they will not give milk,” says Ishwari's friend Nirmala. “We've never seen anything like that happen, but our elders say we must not touch the cows.” Nirmala and Laxmi Kalpana Joshi, 45, is resigned to her monthly stays in her “chhau” hut, a room little bigger than a crawl space beneath her village shop. “Nothing will happen,” she says, reassuring the younger women who fear attacks by animals and drunk men. A few metres away is the village toilet Kalpana helped build as part of a government drive to stop open defecation. It's out of bounds to her because it's believed she will pollute the water supply. “We're not allowed to touch the toilet because it's the same water we use at home,” she says. “We have to go to the fields far away from the house where nobody can see us.” After four days in the hut, the village women bathe in a stream an hour's walk away and are “purified” with cow urine. Only then can they return to normal life. Ishwari's mother herding cows They say chhaupadi is not enforced as strictly as it used to be, telling stories of mothers and grandmothers who were exiled during their monthly bleed. But even this more relaxed interpretation of chhaupadi is too much for some. “I told my parents, 'I won't go, why should I?',” says 22-year-old Laxmi. “My parents got angry, but my brothers understood so they don't mind if I stay at their house,” she says. Laxmi Laxmi knows her protest is unlikely to continue when she marries and moves into her husband's household, as is the tradition in Nepal. “If the family insists I have to sleep outside, I will have no choice,” she says. “I will be forced to do it.” In the evening twilight, the men in Dhamilekh chat by a fire in front of the village store. There's talk of the new road that reaches the village - a precarious, narrow rock path prone to landslides during the monsoon. The road was built to bring prosperity. But instead it has meant that village men can no longer earn a living carrying goods on their backs, forcing them to India and the Gulf states to work as migrant labourers. With so many men away, the women are needed more than ever to tend to the cattle and bring in the harvest. But the men still believe in the necessity, and power, of chhaupadi. “I used to get sick if my wife touched me during her period - of course I did,” says 74-year-old Shankar Joshi. A younger man, Yagya, also thinks the tradition should continue, but for different reasons. Yagya Joshi “In the old days, people might have said the gods get angry and that's why the practice was followed,” he says. “But I believe it's more about keeping a clean environment and health and safety in the house,” he says, noting that village women only have cloth rags to soak up their flow. “Menstrual blood is a poison,” he says. No-one can pinpoint exactly where the idea that periods are unclean comes from, but it is often attributed to Hindu scriptures. The villagers of Dhamilekh, like 80% of Nepal's population, are Hindus. They look for guidance to priests like Narayan Prasad Pokharel, who sees menstruation as sacred, but also dangerous. Narayan Prasad Pokharel “If the woman does not restrict herself, then the impurities that have been in her body could transfer to the man during sexual intercourse. That will result in terrible diseases,” he says. There is even an annual religious ceremony for women to atone for accidentally touching a man, or polluting their environment. During Rishi Panchami, women fast and bathe in sacred water. Chhaupadi may have its roots in religious scriptures, but it's become a widespread social practice. “There are some communities who do it because they put religion as a reason, but there are some communities that do it because they live in places where it's practised,” says Pema Lhaki, a development worker specialising in reproductive health. Pema Lhaki “So we've had incidences where even Buddhists are doing it because everyone else is,” she says. In 2005, the Nepalese Supreme Court outlawed the practice of chhaupadi. But, especially in the remote far west of the country, traditions are slow to change. And it's not just the men who think women should remain isolated during their periods. “You have to engage with the mothers-in-law,” says Pema Lhaki. “It's a power dynamic. They make sure their daughters-in-law do it because they had to do it.” Hundreds of miles to the east of Dhamilekh's steep hillsides is Nepal's crowded capital, Kathmandu. Here children learn about menstruation at school and women can easily buy sanitary protection. But the taboos surrounding periods have not completely disappeared. Nirmala Limbu and Divya Shrestha are recent graduates in their early 20s. Divya Shrestha and Nirmala Limbu “The rules didn't make sense to me growing up. My mother told me I was not allowed to touch plants, especially fruit trees,” says Nirmala. “I used to keep on touching those plants - none of them died,” she says. For Divya, getting her period meant being banned from attending a religious festival. “I had prepared everything for worship and had worked all day and suddenly I had my period and everyone said we had to purify everything I had touched,” she says. “It was really sad for me as a young girl. Why should I be called impure. It's a natural thing that every woman goes through.” Nepalese society is changing. Although Nirmala and Divya faced some restrictions, they were mild compared with those endured by their mothers. “When we had our periods, people seemed disgusted by us,” says Divya's mother Sudha. “They would keep us apart. We had to use separate plates, wear different clothes. Nobody could touch us,” she says. When Sudha gave birth to Divya, she decided that she could not put her own daughter through the same humiliation. “Even though my family were angry with me, I didn't listen to them. It was my decision,” she says. Because of her mother's determination, Divya grew up largely without restrictions, believing she could live life normally during her period. “It's built up my confidence,” says Divya. “I've got a better education because of it - I have a better position in society.” In Nepal there are now many girls like Divya who are not held back by taboos surrounding periods. But Pema Lhaki, who runs a programme on reproductive health, says that even in the city, old attitudes can be hard to shift. “I feel the biggest danger comes from educated women,” she says. “It's the woman I can meet at a party in Kathmandu who tells me she doesn't go into the kitchen when she's menstruating. “These are the women who are indirectly perpetuating all of this.” In the grasslands of southern Nepal, health worker Laxmi Malla is mounting a small, but determined, campaign to bring an end to chhaupadi. On the plains - known as the Terai - the huts that women must sleep in during their periods are open-sided, with roofs made of straw. It's not unusual to see three or four women sleeping in one small hut, using old clothing for bedding. There's no protection from monsoon rain, or the snakes that inhabit the long grass. Laxmi Malla Laxmi works in the area around the town of Dhanghadi. Here plenty of shops sell sanitary towels, but they are too expensive for the village women, who use balls of cloth instead. “They wash, dry and reuse them,” says Laxmi. “I teach them how to wash them properly - to leave them to dry in the sun to kill off bacteria.” Laxmi's advice on hygiene is readily followed, but when it comes to telling villagers to stop chhaupadi, she's faced angry resistance. “We go door to door,” she says of her campaign which attempts to persuade families that the gods will not be angry if the old ways are abandoned. “It's very difficult. People quarrel with us. They even curse. Most of the time we have to go to villages with the police.” But slowly, over the years, Laxmi has witnessed change in the rural communities she visits. “People are no longer forcing girls to sleep outside,” she says. “I think in our area, the practice of chhaupadi will stop in a year.” Back in the hills of far west Nepal, there has been another drive to end chhaupadi. Over the past two years, the local government and NGOs have helped organise a campaign to tear down the huts in the village of Majhigaun. Devaki Joshi owns the local shop and was part of the organising committee. “In the old days, people didn't shower or wash their clothes so it was more unhygienic during periods - perhaps this is why chhaupadi began,” she says. “But now at school they have a cupboard with sanitary towels for students.” But not everyone has accepted the change. A few houses down from Devaki's shop, Chiutari Sunar sits outside with her mother-in-law. Chiutari Sunar (r) with her mother-in-law “We still follow the same practices,” she says pointing to the space beneath the house where the buffalo are kept. It's her new chhaupadi sleeping spot now her old hut has been demolished. A house in Majhigaun “In our house, when we are menstruating, we can't go inside at any cost, no matter what the government says. This is even more important to me than going to the temple.” Even Devaki, who is enthusiastic about the success of her project, admits that some people may never accept the change. “We don't want to hurt the feelings of the older people like my mother,” she says. “We still don't touch them when we have our period.” Lila Ghale, the local head of the government department for women and children, says it may take another generation before chhaupadi is fully eliminated. “We are working with everyone - men, women and even witch-doctors,” she says. Lila Ghale “Our culture is patriarchal and many women are illiterate which makes it hard to change things.” And, says health worker Pema Lhaki, changing attitudes is not just about telling people chhaupadi is bad. She wants Nepalese girls to celebrate their monthly bleed. “Who says it is impure? It gives life. We tell women there is power in their periods,” she says. “We tell them there's power in your blood.” Built with Shorthand",Positive,1.0

"Back together after 29 years: (L-R) Keren Woodward, Sara Dallin and Siobhan Fahey What's your favourite time of day? Have you ever worn odd socks? Why are you dressed as the devil? Pop magazines took a very different approach to interviews in the 1980s and, as the decade's biggest girl band, Bananarama found themselves fielding all of the above questions and more. Smash Hits, Look-In and Number 1 devoted dozens of pages to the trio, many of which dwelt on the fact they lived together on the 11th floor of a block of flats in Holborn. ""It always looked better in the photos than it did in real life,"" laughs Keren Woodward, now 56 and living in more comfortable circumstances in Cornwall. ""It was a dive,"" recalls her bandmate and childhood friend Sara Dallin. ""You're not house-proud when you're young.  But now I'd be like, 'Take your shoes off!'"" Still, those irreverent, Python-esque profiles were often more revealing than the now-standard ""tell me about your co-writers"" pop interview. So, to celebrate the reunion of Bananarama's original line-up -and their first ever tour- we scoured the back issues and put a bunch [get it? - puns ed] of old questions to Sara, Keren and Siobhan to see how their answers have changed. ""Are these Neil Tennant's questions?"" asks Sara before we start. ""He always reminds us he interviewed us once, but I don't remember it."" ""Back then, every magazine wanted their own photos,"" recalls Sara Keren:A lot of my family were teachers, so that's what I always thought I'd end up being.  I think I'd have been quite strict - strict but fair - and, I like to think, hugely engaging. Siobhan:I think I wanted to be [60s pop star] Melanie. Back in 1983, Siobhan said she would like to be an ""air hostess"", while Keren and Sara both talked about becoming ""David Essex's wife"". Sara:Oh God, I'm sure I never would have said that. Aged 12? Not at 12. Keren[to Siobhan]:Oh yes, you went for a job as an air hostess. We took your picture, standing on a pouffe. Sara:In your mother's skirt, trying to look elegant. This video can not be played The band give Chris Evans the lowdown on their big comeback Sara:Did I say, 'Dolphin'? No? For God's sake. Dog? Lion? Pheasant? Siobhan:I was going to say elephant because I love them so, but they get butchered, don't they? Keren:I would have said dog. The original answers were actually dog (Siobhan), tiger (Sara) and horse (Keren). Sara:But you hate horses. Keren:I didn't know that at the time! I hadn't been thrown off one yet. Bananarama sold more than 40 million records worldwide making then, at the time, the world's most-successful girl band Keren:I absolutely loathed it. Siobhan:I loved it. Whatever hormones kicked in, I got really happy. Keren:I just felt very young and unprepared. I didn't know anyone who'd been pregnant, and I didn't know anyone who'd had a baby. Because everyone around me  didn't really get it, I just kept on as though nothing was happening, even though I was slightly scared and throwing up everywhere. Sara would say, 'For God's sake, you're only pregnant, come out.' Speaking in 1987, Keren said the only benefit of pregnancy was being sober, which had meant ""I was handy for a lift now and then"". She recently revealed that having children had stopped Bananarama's original line-up going on tour. Keren:We were so desperate to get on stage. And, in a way, maybe it was good we didn't, because we didn't have the right people around us. We were just doing it ourselves. Sara:If you look at the early performances, we look incredibly shy. We'd come straight from school, and then we were on Top of the Pops. We had absolutely no clue at all. Siobhan:I think that was all part of the charm. Sara:Even when we went on tour in [19]89 [with Siobhan's replacement, Jacquie O'Sullivan], I couldn't say we were hugely confident about what we were doing. Keren:I mean, the only experience we had of being on stage was getting up, putting on a cassette and singing over the top. Sara:But it's like any job. If you work in a bank or an office, you'd be shy when you arrived, and then you'd learn and then you'd be fine. It's just taken us 30 years. The video for Venus saw the band dressing up as goddesses and devils from history Sara:That's about the Venus video. The costume was so uncomfortable. It was a really tight corset with two poles running down the side of my arms, and a black wig. It was not an erotic experience, I'm afraid. Siobhan:That was the first time we really went for an extravaganza in the costume department; obviously triggered by the lyrics of the song. And I think that's where we discovered our enjoyment of camp. The video accompanied Venus, the first song the band produced with Mike Stock, Matt Aitken, and Pete Waterman's ""hit factory"", which also churned out hits for Kylie, Jason and Sinitta. Keren:When it got really pop and quite camp, that was when Siobhan started to get disillusioned. But for me, personally, it just felt like I'd come alive. I enjoyed that period so much because it was just out-and-out pop. I'd just given up trying to explain we weren't dimwits and that we were serious artists. So it was just like letting go, and I embraced the whole pop thing and I absolutely loved it. Siobhan:Making [the album] Wow! with Waterman, Stock and Aitken, they had a very much production-line approach. I felt there wasn't much room for musical experimentation with them, because they had their sound, and that was frustrating for me. Sara:We always wrote with them. They would have preferred to write everything, but we wouldn't let them. Siobhan:But I have to say, in hindsight, Wow! is the album that hangs together the best. The band's hits included Venus, Love In The First Degree and Really Saying Something Keren:In Los Angeles, when Mike Tyson sang Cruel Summer. Sara:We were walking back from breakfast to our hotel, where he was also staying. He was sitting in a limo, and he saw us and started singing Cruel Summer. We were just gobsmacked. Keren: And he was world champ at the time. He was just the last person on Earth you'd expect to sing a Bananarama song. And you think, well, your reach must have got quite far with that sort of thing. Siobhan's original answer was that she didn't feel famous, ""apart from when you're recognised on buses"". Siobhan:I remember our first trip to Santa Monica, this girl got really excited when she saw us, and she came running up to me and shouted, 'Oh my God, aren't you the girl from Dexy's Midnight Runners?' And I was like, 'No, that's my sister.' [Maire Fahey starred in the video for Dexy's hit single Come On Eileen]. The original line-up split shortly after this performance at the 1988 Brit Awards Keren:Now? No. Siobhan:It's been hilarious. We haven't stopped laughing. Keren:It's back to the good old days before they turnedâ¦ stale. Sara:Stale - that's a much better word than sour. In 1986, Siobhan said: ""It's very hard working together and being mates sometimes, but no matter how hard it gets, you sort of understand each other."" She quit the band two years later, and the friends didn't speak for almost a decade. The band were regular guests on Top of the Pops and, here, Kenny Everett's Television Show Sara:Obviously not. Siobhan:I'm writing a script at the moment, in between Bananarama things. It's a historical epic, set in Elizabethan times. But I don't want to give too much away. Keren fielded this question in 1984, saying: ""If we did, it would have to be one of those cheap musicals."" Keren:We always had plans, on and off. We were approached to do the story of Bananarama as a film. Sara:The trouble with us was we never had management that consolidated our ideas, so it never got put together. I mean, the Spice Girls made a film, which was kind of what ours was going to be like, but we never got it together. Siobhan:It would be a TV series now. Things have swung that way. Keren:We could play the mums. They did record a song called Venus, after all... Siobhan:Well, for sure. There's got to be. Sara:We haven't discovered any, though. You'd think we would have discovered something by now. All we hear about is water here and gas there. Maybe this is because, as Siobhan said in 1986, we'd be unable to see alien life forms ""because they're bound to have a totally different chemical make-up"". Siobhan:Oh yeah, they're right here in this room but on a different frequency. Keren:And they are really excited about the Bananarama reunion. They are desperate for it. The trio were the only singers to appear on both the first and second Band Aid singles Sara:Cruel Summer, just because that was such an odd little pop song. It was our first hit in the States, which was unbelievably exciting. Siobhan:I think we all have that as a favourite, because it just sounds like nothing before or afterwards, really. Sara's answer remains the same, but in 1986 Keren plumped for the band's debut single, Aie-A-Mwana, while Siobhan preferred Really Saying Something for its ""shrieky vocals"". Sara: We're going to set aside some time this year to get together and do some [new music] for the tour. Keren:It would be a shame to not have something new. Will it live up to the past? Well if it doesn't, we won't release it. Take two bottles into the shower? Sara:Every day. Every day, she washes her hair. Keren:I've got greasy hair, what can I say? I never skip more than one day. In 1984, Keren claimed the figure was ""twice a week"", prompting general disbelief from her friends. Not in this climate, love Siobhan:Ew. Sara:I'd call the police. Keren:I'd call all my friends over. I wouldn't watch on my own. Take some photos. Keren originally replied she'd ""put some mirrored shades on"" and watch while pretending to look the other way. Sara:That's a bit raunchy. Siobhan:They were odd questions in those days. Sara and Keren have kept the band going as a duo since 1992 Keren:I'm looking forward to doing the vocal arrangements for the tour. That's my favourite bit. I'm hoping we can sing three-part harmonies on some of the songs, because we always used to sing in unison. It would be nice to do it in a more grown-up way. Siobhan:The staging is all in the pipeline, but it'll reflect our personality and ""unique style"" [everyone laughs]. Keren:I don't want to be standing there with lasers going off. Our show will be about the camaraderie and the fun. Speaking on the phone in 1987, Siobhan's response to this question was simply: ""I'm going to get out of this bath. The water's gone horribly cold."" The classic Bananarama line-up tours the UK for the first time this November. Tickets are on sale now.

"Ian Paterson was described as ""charming"" by his patients Thousands of patients were introduced to breast surgeon Ian Paterson. The 59-year-old, who has been found guilty of wounding with intent, appeared trusting, kind and with their best interests at heart. But he left them disfigured and suffering years of mental and physical torment. Here, some of them share their stories. Frances Perks lost her mother and sister to breast cancer, so when a lump showed up on a mammogram when she was 35, she was referred to Paterson. During one consultation, he urged her to have a double mastectomy or risk ""full-blown cancer"". She had her left breast removed and underwent eight other operations at the private Spire Parkway Hospital in Solihull, West Midlands. However, she later learned that none had been necessary. The effect on her life has been devastating. ""I was very worried. Because not only mum, but my older sister had died of breast cancer and she was only 40,"" said Mrs Perks, of Burntwood, Staffordshire. Paterson told her she was ""high risk"" because of her family history. ""I had a mammogram once a year, and then an ultrasound every six months. When things did start to crop up, he'd say 'there's something sinister there, I don't like the look of it and because of your family history we need to careful. I think it should come out.' Mrs Perks underwent nine operations at Spire Parkway Hospital in Solihull By 2008, she had undergone nine operations - the final being a left mastectomy. Paterson had told her, if it were him, he would have both breasts removed, but her insurers would not cover a preventative treatment. ""I had a fear that I could end up with breast cancer, which scared the living daylights out of me,"" she said. ""But when I was told I didn't need any of it, I was so shocked."" Mrs Perks' tissue was studied as part of a review of Paterson's work in 2012. The results showed the lumps had all been benign and the removal of her breast should never have happened. A genetic specialist later reassured her she had only ever been at moderate risk of developing cancer. Paterson's actions did not only affect Mrs Perks physically. The stress of learning her operations were unnecessary caused her to leave her job at a firm of solicitors, and her financial hardship left her with no option but to sell her house. ""I feel hatred - pure hatred,"" she said. ""I did not think I could hate someone as much as I hate him. ""I want to see him suffer because, OK, he might think he's suffered over the last few years but that's not good enough for me. Not for what he's put me through, what I've lost, and how it's affected me mentally and physically."" Breast surgeon needlessly harmed patients Arrogant bully who 'mutilated' patients What is cleavage-sparing surgery? Jade Edgington was just 16 and studying for her A-levels when she found a lump in her breast while in the shower. She was introduced to Paterson at the Spire Hospital and, by the time she was 19, had undergone four invasive operations. She later learned three procedures were unnecessary as the lumps were not even at risk of becoming cancerous. ""He told me we needed to get it out,"" she said. ""He said it wasn't anything scary, but that it was big enough to get it out."" She went on to find three more lumps, and again Paterson said they should be removed. She and her family trusted his opinion. ""[We thought] he's the expert, he knows what he's doing. We went ahead with his advice."" Jade's operations, which happened while she was studying for her A-levels, have left her scarred for life Two years after her last operation she was recalled to be seen by another doctor who was reassessing Paterson's work. ""He came back and said they would have monitored the first lump for 12 months, and may not have taken it out, and the other three operations did not need to happen because I was so young. ""I was 16, I was growing and changing and they would have suggested I didn't have those operations,"" added Ms Edgington, who is now 28 and a bank worker. ""Why put us all through that? You feel almost violated - essentially, someone has stuck a knife in me unnecessarily. ""You can't believe a man of his calibre has put somebody through something like that unnecessarily."" Marie Pinfield (left) and her sister Shirley Moroney were the best of friends Police officer Marie Pinfield was diagnosed with advanced breast cancer in August 2006 and asked Paterson for a double mastectomy. However, instead of waking up with the flat chest she expected, the surgeon - who pioneered the controversial ""cleavage-sparing"" surgical technique - had left so much tissue behind she had to wear a bra. She asked for a second operation to correct the work. However, the subsequent delay to chemotherapy and radiotherapy meant she developed secondary cancer in her lung and died in October 2008. Heart of England NHS Trust admitted the second operation would not have been necessary if the double mastectomy had been carried out properly. An independent report found Ms Pinfield could have lived for 10 more years had she received the right initial treatment. Her sister, Shirley Moroney, remembers the first time they met Paterson. ""He was absolutely charming,"" she said. ""He came across as a bit arrogant, but that almost gave you confidence that he would do a good job. ""At the point we had to make a complaint, that arrogance and charm was a difficult combination to work with. ""His attitude was 'how dare you question what I've done for you?'"" Ms Pinfield, a child protection officer with West Midlands Police, had made it clear to Paterson she wanted a double mastectomy. ""He was reluctant to agree to that,"" recalled her sister. ""He said 'lots of people say that - they're in shock - and later on they look at their body shape and they wish they'd made another decision'."" Marie and her niece Ciara ""I was shocked at how much material she still had on her body,"" said Mrs Moroney. ""I waited around to see him. I needed to ask him why she had so much left on her body. And his reaction to me was 'I knew you'd be trouble'. ""He said - I've taken all the mammary glands out. There's no breast tissue left. All that is left is fatty tissue."" Paterson finally agreed to a second procedure. ""On reflection, he should have said: 'Marie, let's do the chemotherapy, let's do the radiotherapy, and we'll sort your body issues out afterwards,"" said Mrs Moroney. ""But he didn't. ""You need a month's recovery after the operation before you can start your chemotherapy and radiotherapy. That delay in her getting treatment is probably the reason the secondary cancer came back so quickly. ""The guy had a God complex. He felt that women could only be in this world if they'd got a breast body shape. ""Marie believed in justice, and right and wrong, doing the job she did. I know she will be looking down on me, willing me to go on."" Cheryl Iommi first met Paterson in 2003 when she was having lumps removed from her right breast at Solihull Hospital. He operated on her twice and told her she appeared to be developing cancer. She later learned the lumps he claimed were a cancer risk were simply scar tissue left behind from his botched procedures. ""When I first met him at Solihull Hospital, he came across as quite aggressive. He wasn't a very nice man on the National Health,"" she said. He put her to sleep, and when she woke up, she discovered he had operated on both sides of her body without her consent. ""He said I'd had a lump in my left side as well,"" recalled Ms Iommi. ""Initially, I felt grateful that he'd got another lump out. But when I saw what he'd done, I thought: 'Oh my word'."" She had been left with a large ""dent"" in her side. To try and correct the damage, she went on to have reconstructive surgery but was never happy with the results. The surgery later ruptured. Over the years, the mother of two continued to find lumps in her breast. In 2010, she decided to go to a private clinic and when she booked an appointment at Spire hospital in Solihull, met Paterson again. ""He was a completely different person this time. As nice as pie. Ian Paterson was charming and confident - but he betrayed his patients' trust ""He said he could take the lumps out in a week, so he did. When I had my check-up he told me 'we're so lucky we caught it when we did'."" Shortly after, Ms Iommi, from Birmingham, was told her surgery needed to be reviewed. She has since seen many medical professionals who have told her the lumps in her breasts are simply scar tissue. Her experience has left her traumatised. ""He's an educated man,"" she said. ""I believed him. I'm still scared now. ""I'm forever at the doctors. I have a lump in my throat due to anxiety. I feel like I've been duped - seriously misled. ""I think he did it for power - and a lack of respect for women. Why mutilate women so they no longer want their partners to look at them?"" Debbie Douglas says she copes with the trauma of having unnecessary surgery by always being 'on the go' In the space of three years, mother-of-three Debbie Douglas lost both her parents to cancer and was diagnosed with breast cancer herself. Paterson performed a cleavage-sparing mastectomy which left her in ""horrendous"" pain. She later learned her cancer was not serious enough to warrant a mastectomy or the exhausting, seven-month course of chemotherapy she endured. ""He never bothered telling me any of that - he just took my breast off,"" said Mrs Douglas, 58, of Birmingham. Paterson recommended immediate reconstructive surgery, which involved taking part of the stomach muscle and using it to shape the new breast. ""I was cut from hip to hip and had all my lymph nodes removed. Afterwards I had no core strength - even now, I struggle to lift my granddaughter. I also got a hernia, which is a common side effect. ""I was grieving for my parents, and I was in horrendous pain for a long time."" Paterson never told her he was giving her one of his signature cleavage-sparing ops. It was only when she was recalled and reviewed, she learnt he had not taken away all the breast tissue. ""I always knew my scar looked different to what it should have done. I don't know why he gave it to me - he didn't explain anything to me about it at all."" She estimates the cost of all her surgery exceeded Â£100,000. ""He was the best surgeon - the top notch consultant. If he'd have told me to stand on one leg to get rid of my cancer, I'd have done it. ""He used to say: 'You can be cured.' He used to say that a lot. ""He's left me with a real fear my cancer will return. I am still paying to get checked out, because I don't want to get cancer."" Patricia Welch was one of 10 patients who gave evidence in Paterson's trial at Nottingham Crown Court Paterson had told Patricia Welch he had found a ""ticking bomb"" of cancerous cells in her breast - she was so scared of the consequences she opted for a mastectomy and immediate reconstruction. But when her case was reviewed as Paterson's work was called into question, an expert found her symptoms had been grossly exaggerated. His trial at Nottingham Crown Court heard Paterson embellished the cancer risk to both Mrs Welch and her doctor, and her mastectomy was unnecessary. ""I don't know whether he liked to play God or whether he liked to see the women he saw be grateful for what he'd done and whether he got a kick out of it,"" she said. ""He was just sitting there in open court on a laptop as if he hadn't got a care in the world. ""Hate is a strong word. I've never hated anyone in my life before, but it's pretty close. ""He won't suffer as all of us have been made to suffer all these years. ""I don't think you can ever get over it, because you've got it looking back at you in the mirror every morning. ""What he did. It will never go away. When you go private, you think you've got the best.""

"Some parents of disabled children can appear unwaveringly positive. But one mother says her children's autism has left her with ""dark thoughts"" and she wishes their impairments would disappear. ""It just stops everything dead,"" she says, the moment she tells anyone all three children have autism. Christine, not her real name, loves and is proud of her children, but she says she cannot abide the pressure she feels to be ""relentlessly positive"" about their condition because of the restrictions it puts on all of them. She says parents are often depicted cheerfully talking about the ""breakthrough moments"" and slight improvements their children make which they seem fulfilled by - but which she can't grasp. ""I often feel there's not really space in the autism world for a mother to say 'I really wish this wasn't happening, I don't feel blessed, I don't feel strong, I don't feel like it's all happening for a reason'. ""I get riled when people say well-meaning things like 'you must be a really strong person because you wouldn't be given more than what you can deal with' - this just doesn't feel like a reward, actually."" Listen to Christine speaking to BBC Radio 4's iPM programme on thepodcast page. You can also hear the mother's account in audiohere. Christine is a single mum and works as a psychiatric nurse. Her son, 19, was diagnosed with autism aged six followed by dyspraxia and a mood disorder; her 17-year-old daughter was diagnosed with autism and ADHD in 2015; and her 14-year-old daughter was diagnosed when she was eight. ""For me, the diagnosis of my middle child was earth-shatteringly awful because I think, on reflection, I always had this notion that 'one of them's going to be alright' and I found that crushing."" ""There's a celebratory notion that this is a fantastic thing,"" she says, and feels that the community won't let people be anything other than relentlessly positive. ""I love my children and I'm so proud of what they can do - but if I could take away the difficulties that they've got and give them different lives, then I would."" Journalist Michael Blastland has a 22-year-old son, Joe, who lives in a residential unit with ""pretty profound"" autism and limited communication. He says Joe has ""character and spirit"" and a ""deep obsession"" for Postman Pat - so much so, there are three VCRs stashed in the attic for when one breaks down. Blastland recognises what Christine means about feeling uncomfortable with the uptalk, but says: ""I still try and hang on to these little extraordinary facets of Joe's character and ability."" He says the ""autism pride movement"" can be problematic for those who don't assign to it - and there are also those with autism who take pride in their difference, which is ""perfectly legitimate in many ways"". But, he also says, ""you cannot say that all people with autism are fine [self-sufficient]"", and as much as he loves Joe, he admits ""if I could wave the wand, I'd take it away in a stroke. ""I just wish that I could say that without leaving the other people who have the same label feeling threatened."" One person who struggles to understand Christine's point of view is Jo Lewis, whose 12-year-old daughter Holly has autism. It manifests itself through separation anxiety, distress at loud noises, social struggles and taking idioms like ""it's raining cats and dogs"" literally. ""I saw the diagnosis as opening the door to support, but we've had moments of despair, we've cried and screamed and argued about it,"" she says. ""You have a bad moment - and then I'll glance at the piano which she plays beautifully, and she wouldn't be who she was if she didn't have autism. ""Sometimes I feel guilty because other people struggle, but I would not take autism away from Holly; autism is what people make of it."" Christine, too, recognises that as much as she despairs at the expectation of positivity, she doesn't wish to upset others who focus on it. ""Perhaps it looks a little uncaring or a little selfish, because you're not just selflessly embracing everything around your children,"" she says, but as her children grow and their needs become more complex, the joy continues to recede. For years, Christine's children attended mainstream school - but it caused great distress. They recognised they were different to their peers, which ""hurt and damaged them""; her son asked for an invisibility cloak and one daughter talked of suicide. All three have since been placed in special schools. Can you spot him? She says despite working as a psychiatric nurse, which gave her ""inside knowledge"" into the system, she worries how their adult lives will pan out. When her eldest son turned 18, he lost his mental health support - and Christine's ""absolute fear"" is that he will ""just disappear"", as he does not have the ability to contact services himself. ""No one would know if he got poorly,"" she says. ""He would lie in his bed and just stop eating and drinking; he wouldn't move and nobody would know."" Christine says she finds it very difficult to find the positives here, but there are glimmers of joy she hangs on to. ""My eldest was very withdrawn as a youngster, he wouldn't tolerate physical touch, there was no recognition from him that you were someone he knew. ""He ran up to the man dressed as Santa Claus and, referring to me, he said: 'Santa Claus, that's my Mummy'. ""It was so rare to think that he even knew who I was that I carry that in my heart.""

"""Nobody knows exactly what the sexual charge was between Adolf Hitler and Unity Mitford,"" her biographer David Pryce-Jones says As one of the high-society sisters who enthralled and scandalised 20th Century England, Unity Mitford's return home from Germany in January 1940 caused an outcry. Fresh from an ill-fated dalliance with Adolf Hitler and with a bullet lodged in her brain, Unity had the government, MI5 and the nation's gossip columnists hot on her heels. So how did she end up living with a family in a quiet Warwickshire vicarage? The first memory Margaret Laidlaw has of Unity Mitford is of her standing under a chestnut tree in Leamington Spa with Margaret's mother. Margaret, who was eight years old, remembers the most notorious of the Mitford sisters looked like nobody she had ever seen before. ""She was very tall with a lovely ruby brooch at her neck - she always wore that. She had fair hair. That's my first real memory of her,"" Margaret said. ""My mother said, 'This is Auntie Unity and she may be coming to stay with us'. I remember feeling confused - I had never heard any mention of an Auntie Unity.'"" Unity was installed in the vicarage as a permanent house guest, living there with Margaret and her sister A few weeks after that first introduction, Unity was installed as a permanent house guest at the vicarage in Hillmorton, Warwickshire, where Margaret lived with her father the Rev Frederick Sewell-Corby, her mother Bettyne and her younger sister. Margaret remembers watching bewildered as her father's clothes and books were removed from her parents' bedroom. Margaret's mother had to sleep in the same room as Unity and nurse her through the night. ""Unity was incontinent - I knew this from the sheets galore that were hung out on the line each morning,"" Margaret said. ""And she had a leg that was paralysed and swung like a log when she walked."" Margaret's father went to sleep in his dressing room and locks and bars went on all the vicarage doors and windows. Unity was returned to Britain via Switzerland after her suicide attempt in Germany ""I think Unity was under what you and I would call house arrest,"" Margaret said. ""She was never, ever alone."" But unbeknown to the little girl, ""Auntie Unity"" was no relative and her reputation was notorious. She had been discussed in the House of Commons. Her whereabouts was considered to be a matter of national security. For she was rumoured to be the girlfriend of Adolf Hitler himself. Unity's sister Diana married Sir Oswald Mosley, leader of the British Union of Fascists Unity was one of thesix Mitford sisterswho were the daughters of Lord Redesdale Her sister Diana married Sir Oswald Mosley, leader of the British Union of Fascists ""Unity saw her beautiful older sister making waves and wanted to go one better, by picking up Hitler,"" says Unity's biographer David Pryce-Jones She discovered where Hitler liked to have lunch with his cronies in Munich and waited there until he asked her to his table. She wrote she considered the Fuhrer ""sweet"" Hitler invited Unity to his box at the Berlin Olympics and paid for a flat in Munich for her Most historians do not believe there was a sexual relationship but Mr Pryce-Jones estimates she met Hitler about 100 times. ""Nobody English got so close to Hitler,"" he said. ""She was right in the inner circle of the Nazi leadership"" This video can not be played Footage shows Unity Mitford joining Hitler at his mountain retreat She had returned to England, after several years in Nazi Germany, following a failed suicide attempt. When Britain declared war on Germany in September 1939, a distraught Unity went to the Englischer Garten park in Munich (the English Garden) and shot herself in the head. Upon her return to Britain - with a bullet remaining lodged in her brain - she was vilified as an enemy of the state and the Home Office faced calls to have her interned. Unity ""was right in the inner circle of the Nazi leadership"", according to her biographer David Pryce-Jones It was finally decided the vicarage in Hillmorton was a safe enough haven for Unity - a place where she could receive the care she needed and live a less troublesome existence. Lady Redesdale, Unity's mother, was a client of Margaret's mother, a chiropodist, and it was agreed Mrs Sewell-Corby could act as Unity's nurse. ""The vicarage was always open to everyone,"" Margaret said. ""People that were down-and-outs came and asked us for a cup of coffee. ""My mother obviously thought it would be kind to have her. No doubt there was a lot of government correspondence going on. ""I think [my father] found it very, very difficult. He was doing his wartime effort, which was to look after a potentially dangerous person. ""Unity had no money, she had no passport, she had no writing paper. She was allowed absolutely nothing at all. For a while, she wasn't even allowed a library ticket."" Unbeknown to the young Margaret Laidlaw, her family's new house guest had a notorious reputation Margaret believes Unity stayed with the family for long periods between 1943 and 1948. The arrangement was largely kept secret. ""We weren't allowed to talk about it to anyone,"" she said. ""It was just completely taboo. ""No doubt my parents were extremely worried and concerned but I had no idea at all about it. I didn't realise she was under lock and key. She was just a visitor."" Some historians have suggested Unity was carrying Hitler's love child - although Margaret insists there is no evidence of this. ""It's absolute rubbish,"" she said. ""I don't believe she was capable of having any children."" According to MI5, Unity was ""mentally unsound"" and ""harmless"" However, the Home Office reported complaints from members of the public that Unity was ""driving about... picking up airmen"". The local police inspector was forced to launch an investigation Mrs Laidlaw says Unity's presence in the vicarage was probably not popular with locals. ""I'm not sure people were happy to have someone so closely connected with the enemy in their midst,"" she said But she was, nonetheless, a source of fascination. John Howes, from Rugby, remembers his grandfather Frank telling him about Unity's fondness for chip suppers. ""She used to go walking through Hillmorton eating fish and chips. My grandfather was amused by this sight as she was 'a member of the aristocracy',"" Mr Howes said Unity brought with her a dog Lieblich, a dachshund said to have been given to her by Hitler. The Mitford sister had to be accompanied everywhere. Despite the atmosphere of constant surveillance, Margaret remembers these periods as happy times. Unity brought her dog, Lieblich, to the vicarage - he was said to be a present from Hitler ""She was always very cheerful, very jolly,"" Margaret said. ""She was a very good artist. We used to pick ragged robin and dog roses on the country lanes and we would come back and she would show us how to paint them. ""I don't remember being in the room with her for any length of time on our own. Mother was always there, knitting or playing the piano. ""My memory is that Unity liked Bavarian marching songs and would stride around singing. I remember she had a record player and a lot of 78 records. She was a very good singer - a bit loud and very spontaneous."" This video can not be played The Warwickshire stay of Hitler's British 'girlfriend' Margaret now believes she and her sister were protected by their mother and father from some of Unity's more extreme views. ""I'm sure our parents were very careful,"" she said. ""There was great emphasis on the fact that the Jews were as good as anybody else. ""In later life, I was horrified to discover Unity was anti-Semitic. I think my parents did a very good job in keeping that one away from us."" Unity tried to kick Margaret when she failed to express regret over the death of Hitler Margaret clearly remembers the final days of the war in Europe, as word of Hitler's suicide in a bunker in Berlin reached the breakfast tables of Britain. ""My sister said, 'Morning Auntie Unity. I'm so sorry your boyfriend's died' and she said, 'Oh, you are such a sweet child',"" Margaret recalls. ""And I said, 'Oh - that man'. And she went for me - she went to kick me and I fled under the dining room table to get out of her reach."" Margaret believes her father - pictured here with his family - was doing his bit for the war in looking after Unity Later that year Margaret was sent to boarding school. She believes Unity continued to live with the family during term-times but in the holidays travelled to the Scottish island of Inch Kenneth, where she lived with Lady Redesdale. ""Latterly Mother went up there to nurse her because Lady Redesdale knew she could trust my mother implicitly not to say anything to anybody,"" Margaret said. Today Margaret, 82, lives in Dunbar and is an MBE for her service to the children's charity Unicef Unity died in 1948 in Oban at the age of 33 as a result of meningitis caused by swelling around the bullet lodged in her brain. ""We came home from school and Mother was upstairs in the bathroom crying,"" Margaret remembered. ""I looked at Daddy and he said, 'Thank God it's all over.'""

"Donald Trump: ""I will never, ever infringe on the right of the people to keep and bear arms."" Donald Trump stood at a podium in front of an Atlanta auditorium full of gun lovers. ""You are my friends,"" he told them. ""The eight-year assault on your Second Amendment freedoms has come to a crashing end,"" he said. A woman in the back of the auditorium shouted: ""Thank you."" A moment later a man took off his red Make America Great Again cap, waved it in the air and put it back on his head so he could clap with both hands - loudly. Others in the 10,000-strong audience (National Rifle Association figures) - cheered. Trump talked about Justice Neil Gorsuch and Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke,  all of whom, the president made clear, support the Second Amendment. He also spoke about his intentions: ""Let me make a simple promise,"" he said. ""I will never, ever infringe on the right of the people to keep and bear arms."" He didn't make any policy announcements, however, or discuss at any length legislation that's important to NRA leaders, such as the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act, which would make permits to carry concealed weapons valid across the nation. He spoke only in generalities, breezing over specifics about firearms policy. NRA members want fewer restrictions on firearms Still, he made the event feel like a ""victory party"", just as Arsenal Attorneys' Matthew Bergstrom, who was speaking at a firearms seminar that afternoon, predicted he would. In the midst of the festive atmosphere, however, there were unresolved issues, and the relationship between Mr Trump and gun owners has been complicated. The president likes to hold his cards close to his chest, and he often changes his mind. This is true in the realm of foreign policy, trade deals and firearms policy too. In the past he's shown support for an assault weapons ban. Last year he reversed his position. His fluid ideas about firearms policy have vexed those who care about the issue, whether they support fewer restrictions on gun owners or more. Gun control is an emotionally raw issue in the US, where mass shootings have become surprisingly common. Most Democrats think Americans would be safer with fewer guns,according to a McClatchy-Marist poll,external. Near the convention hall, a woman in khaki shorts held up a sign: ""No Trump. No NRA. No guns."" Most Republicans, however, believe Americans would be safer if there were more guns. Meanwhile, NRA executives want fewer restrictions on firearms. With that goal in mind, the NRA gave $30m (Â£23m)  to Trump's presidential election campaign. Now he's their president. When it comes to the NRA's positions, though, he's been low-key. Since taking office, he's struck down an Obama-era rule that would have made Social Security Administration officials add names of people who suffer from mental health problems and receive disability support to a database of individuals who cannot purchase a gun. NRA member John Greene (right) says President Trump ""has been rather busy, doing a lot of things"" Beyond that, he hasn't done much in terms of firearms policy. ""For $30m?"" said Brendan Kelly, a spokesman for the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, a Washington-based organization, referring to the amount of money the NRA gave to his campaign. ""The only thing he's done is repeal a law."" Mr Kelly is being sarcastic: he doesn't want Trump to follow the NRA's guidance and lift restrictions on firearms. He wants the president to sign laws that will impose more rules on gun purchases and is disappointed in the way he's changed his mind about firearms policy. Debbie Anderson: ""I think you have to give him (Trump) time"" Donald Trump once argued for stricter rules on gun purchases, and now he talks enthusiastically about the Second Amendment (and doesn't mention gun control). ""The inconsistencies get in the way,"" says Mr Kelly. ""He's bouncing back and forth, and people are dying."" He wishes the president would argue for more restrictions on gun purchases. But that seems unlikely. At the same time, it seems unlikely that the president will push for new policies loosening the restrictions on guns. Activists at both ends of the political spectrum - from left to right - said they have been disappointed in the president. For many of those at the convention, however, the policies were relatively unimportant. They said they were happy he'd come and liked the fact that he was surrounded by people whom they see as sympathetic to their cause. Kellyanne Conway, a top adviser to the president, spoke to a women's group at the event. Flying on Air Force One, she told me she'd grown up hunting and used to bring home wild game: ""You have to prove your manhood,"" she said, joking around. Trump's sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr also enjoy hunting. ""They love the outdoors,"" the president told people in the audience. (Donald Trump Jr, who's an NRA member, reportedly owns an AR-platform semi-automatic rifle.) Stephen Miller, the White House policy director, has reportedly talked about how much he likes guns. He flew to Atlanta with the president. NRA members said it was important to them that the president's friends and family are fond of guns. ""That's a really big trust factor,"" said attorney Stephen Halbrook, who was attending the convention. The auditorium was filled with people wearing pro-gun messages on T-shirts, hats and badges. One man wore a ponytail with flecks of grey and a black T-shirt that said: ""This is America. We eat bacon. We drink beer. We own guns. We love freedom. We speak English. If you don't like it, tough shit."" They clapped loudly during the speech and seemed OK with the president's policy positions (or lack of them). ""I think you have to give him time,"" said Debbie Anderson, an NRA pistol instructor who was dressed in black (with a US flag bracelet). ""He can't get everything done in one day."" Another person in the auditorium, John Greene, an NRA member who lives in Virginia Beach, agreed: ""He's been rather busy, doing a lot of things."" In theory at least, the president was passionate about his commitment. ""I will never, ever let you down,"" he said. A moment later he left, and the NRA members went back to the business of the convention: talking about guns and hanging out with their friends.

"""Our core values are being eroded"" says Jennifer ""The Hong Kong we know isn't dying. It's already dead."" That's the assessment of Jennifer, 29. She came from a modest family background, but studied hard and graduated with a degree from one of Hong Kong's most prestigious universities. She says she studied politics because she wanted to contribute to society - but no longer believes the territory has a future. Jennifer is just one of Hong Kong's many talented, and unhappy, young people. This video can not be played How do Hong Kong's youth feel about the future? Recent surveys paint a depressing picture. According toone study,external, Hong Kong's young people are the unhappiest they have been in a decade - and the least likely, of all age groups, to agree with the statement ""life is really worth living"". Other,externalsurveys find that 60% of those aged 18-29want to emigrate,external, and80% are unhappy,externalwith the political situation. If Hong Kong's youth appear particularly unhappy, it might be because of the territory's unusual situation. It's technically one of the richest territories in Asia, but also has one of the worst wealth gaps. Many - young and old - have concerns about Hong Kong's future And Hong Kongers enjoy free speech and a free press, but don't have the right to democratic elections - meaning they can readily discuss what makes them unhappy, but have limited political means to change things. ""The atmosphere of society doesn't really lend itself to a future for young people,"" says Gary Wong, a lecturer in sociology at the University of Hong Kong. ""They might feel that universal suffrage is not going to happen, and they don't know what will happen after 2047 - including in their own careers, and whether they can afford housing."" Hong Kongoften ranks,externalas having the least affordable housing in the world - and this ""affects young people's family planning, and their choice of future careers,"" Dr Wong says. Hong Kong is one of the most densely populated territories in the world Jennifer grew up in a public estate with her parents and brother - but says after her brother got married, the small two-bedroom flat became extremely cramped. ""For almost a year, I had to sleep on a sofa in the living room."" Not having a room meant she struggled to sleep properly after a long day at work, especially after her brother and his wife had their first baby. And while many older generations like to argue that hard work is rewarded with success, many young people feel that is no longer true. ""We work hard, but there's nothing,"" Jennifer says. Experts say some young people have lost faith in local politics Jennifer and her fiance now plan to emigrate from Hong Kong - due to political concerns as well as the high cost of living. ""Back in 1997 [when Hong Kong was handed back to China], we thought Hong Kong could influence China. But now, what we see is China influencing Hong Kong."" She describes Beijing's recent decision to issue an interpretation of Hong Kong's mini-constitution, to disqualify two pro-independence legislators, as ""a huge blow"" that makes her doubt the rule of law. Even some who would call themselves politically apathetic were worried by the move. Lily, a 20-year-old science student, normally ""doesn't care about politics much"". But Beijing's interpretation left her thinking: ""In the future, will they forcefully push through other laws?"" Will we lose freedom of speech, freedom of thought? That's quite painful, says Lily ""I found it quite horrifying when the legislators were disqualified - because they were democratically elected. It seems like Hong Kong citizens don't have a choice after all."" Dr Wong thinks recent events have also dented young people's faith in politics as a way to channel their opinions. ""This makes young people angry and frustrated"", and the lack of trust could make it ""rather impossible for government to run"", he says. Recent years have seen a rise in youth-led protests - from themass pro-democracy sit-insin 2014 to protests resulting inclashes with police. Although many surveys paint a pessimistic picture, it's important to view them in context. Hong Kongers are often dissatisfied with how things are run - even when the territory does extremely well in some global league tables, such aseducationandhealthcare,external. ""Compared to other places, Hong Kong is quite free"" says Vincent Vincent, 18, was born in and grew up in Hong Kong. His parents had fled Vietnam, and were granted asylum in the territory. He is now studying in one of Hong Kong's top universities. ""Compared to other places, Hong Kong is quite a free place,"" he says. ""As long as you're willing to work, you'll have a job and basic living standards."" The downside, he says, is that ""social mobility isn't very high"". Vincent feels that, ""economically and politically, Hong Kong does need to co-operate with China"". But, like many of his peers, he is also worried about what changes will happen after 2047, when the arrangement that gives Hong Kong special rights and freedoms is set to end. ""Some law students at university think - if Hong Kong's law is different by then, what's the point [of them studying]?"" ""And if our education system merges with mainland China's, there'll be even more competition."" Young people have been at the forefront of many protests Many people agree that Hong Kong has serious political and social challenges - but there is little agreement on solutions. The government has pledged to build more affordable housing - but demand far outstrips supply. When it comes to politics, some groups advocate more dialogue with Beijing, or compulsory Chinese history lessons to improve understanding of the mainland. But many young people are disillusioned with traditional politics, and view these moves with suspicion. Some even support the idea of Hong Kong's independence from China. ""If society is tolerant of young people, there's still hope"" says Karen Karen, a 24 year-old NGO-worker, argues that ""people are getting more extreme and intolerant of others' views"". Karen is part of a group campaigning for democracy, and argues that, with the 2047 deadline edging closer, people need to be pragmatic. ""If everyone sticks to their own ideals, nothing is going to change."" But she stresses the importance of listening to Hong Kong's youth. ""If society is more tolerant of young people, then I think there's still hope."" Is this proof Hong Kongâs 'Umbrella Protests' failed?

As it stands Brighton will take a one-point lead over Newcastle at the top of the table into the final game of the season. Brighton 0-1 Bristol City Changes by both sides as Callum O'Dowda replaces Jamie Paterson for Bristol City, while Fikayo Tomori comes on for Lewis Dunk for Brighton. The defender appears to have picked up a knock. Brighton 0-1 Bristol City Time is running out for Brighton. Anthony Knockaert's effort deflects into the arms of Frank Fielding and the keeper hits the deck to waste a few seconds. There are a few glum faces among the home supporters. They want this title.

"This video can not be played Joshua & Klitschko face off before heavyweight boxing showdown Anthony Joshua v Wladimir Klitschko Date:Saturday, 29 AprilVenue:Wembley StadiumTime:22:00 BST Coverage:Live commentary on BBC Radio 5 live from 21:00 BST and text updates on the BBC Sport website and app from 19:30 BST So much hype, so much on the line, so many opinions. Around 90,000 people will pack into Wembley Stadium on Saturday to see IBF heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua attempt to add the vacant WBA belt to his collection when he faces the division's once dominant force Wladimir Klitschko. A 14-year age gap between the 27-year-old Briton and a fighter he once assisted as a sparring partner means some pundits have styled the bout as apprentice meets master. But it's Joshua who starts as odds-on favourite. Does he justify that status? BBC Sport asked some familiar faces from the world of boxing about how they see things shaping up and, of course, we want your verdict too. In a BBC Sport poll, 72% of voters think that Anthony Joshua will win on Saturday. This video can not be played Perfect time for Anthony Joshua to fight Klitschko - Lennox Lewis Lennox Lewis, the last man to be undisputed heavyweight champion, told BBC Radio 5 live:""Now is the perfect time for Joshua, because Wladimir Klitschko has a chink in his armour in getting beaten by Tyson Fury. ""With the age aspect of Klitschko, he doesn't have the legs, the power that he used to. There are a lot of different factors going on in his life as well. ""I believe Joshua is more focused. Does he want to be undisputed champion? Absolutely."" Did you know? Lewis, Joshua and Klitschko all won Olympic gold but only Joshua and the late Joe Frazier became world champions while still Olympic champion. Joshua has won all 18 of his professional fights, while Klitschko has 64 wins and four losses Former world super-middleweight champion Richie Woodhall:""Klitschko controls the fight better when people are going to him. He's a master at adjusting his feet and keeping a gap, an absolute master. ""I think the victory for Joshua will come by boxing at a distance and making Klitschko come forward. ""I see Joshua winning the fight in the mid to late rounds, around the seventh or eighth. I think Joshua will stop him eventually and catch him with a solid shot. ""At 41, you have to ask how long Klitschko can go on at this level. It will take a hell of a performance to beat Joshua, who I don't think will come out swinging, but will box intelligently. If he goes wading in, he could walk in to a trap."" Did you know? Joshua has spent less than two hours in the ring as a professional on his way to 18 knockout wins in 18 fights. Listen: 'Joshua has only ever lost one round' Tony Bellew Joshua was seven when Klitschko made his professional debut Former super-middleweight world champion Carl Froch,who beat George Groves at Wembley Stadium in 2014:""This is Joshua's first real test at world level. This is his acid test and against a veteran who can punch, box and move to survive when he needs to. ""I think Joshua will be nervous. Wembley Stadium will add to those nerves and I don't think they will help him. I don't think he will enjoy it like I did. Purely because there is a lot of pressure on him - he's expected to win and has this massive task. ""He needs to try and enjoy it. They say cometh the hour cometh the man. He really needs to switch on and live up to what everyone expects of him."" Did you know? Joshua's weight of 17st 12lbs is the heaviest of his career to date. Tyson Fury pulled off one of the great boxing upsets when he beat Klitschko in November 2015 Peter Fury, who trained nephew Tyson to beat Klitschko, told BBC Radio 5 live:""Klitschko probably folds his bed sheets a certain way. So what do you give someone who is a perfectionist? Give him everything he hates. Upset his rhythm, fire shots from all angles. ""I think it's too soon for Joshua. I think his boxing skills leave a lot to be desired. I think he gets hit far too easy, especially with the jab. On a world level you can't be open like that. ""I think a lot of it is inexperience. Ultimately if you've got a leaky defence in the heavyweight division, I don't care if you have dynamite in both hands, you are coming unstuck sooner or later."" Did you know? Klitschko has knocked out 53 of his 68 opponents. Joshua v Klitschko - all you need to know Preview:Joshua's 'stepping stone to greatness' Podcast:I'm ready for Klitschko, says Joshua Feature:Is Joshua the perfect heavyweight? Quiz:Which heavyweight great are you? Klitschko's jab followed by a thumping right hand has become a trademark weapon Former two-weight world champion Paulie Malignaggi:""It's a matter of how much Klitschko has left. At his age, it's probably not a good thing to have had a long lay-off. If he has anything left, he can trouble Joshua. The flicking of the jab, following it with the right hand - it can hurt Joshua, who doesn't have a lot of head movement. ""I think Joshua is going to try to take it to Klitschko and be the boss. Joshua will try to counter the jab with his own right hand. In the end, I think youth will be too much, but Klitschko does have that dynamite right hand."" Did you know? Klitschko could become one of the oldest world heavyweight champions, though George Foreman leads the way, capturing the honour aged 45. This video can not be played Klitschko records Joshua fight prediction on USB Former world heavyweight champion Vitali Klitschko told BBC Radio 5 live:""I've never seen my brother so concentrated. ""I want to say that Joshua is a great fighter, and has great skills, but he has never been at such a high level. He looks relaxed, like it will be easy. It will not be. ""Everyone has weaknesses; Wladimir's is his concentration. If he is 100% concentrated, Joshua has no chance. Ask me about speed, power, experience, Wladimir is better."" Did you know? Vitali had three spells as world heavyweight champion. Wladimir has two to his name so far. This video can not be played Joshua has left 'no stone unturned' for Klitschko fight BBC Radio 5 live analyst Steve Bunce:""I don't think Joshua can outbox Klitschko. I want to see a little bit of nerves, I want to see him sucking in some air, I want to see some sort of fear. If we don't see that then whisper it, it makes him almost inhuman. ""Can Wladimir look like any of the old Wladimirs? Even a bad old Wladimir should be enough to beat this kid Anthony Joshua. I think an awful lot has been placed on the assumption, the dream, the hope, that Wladimir at 41 has nothing left. If that's not the case then we are in for a tricky night. ""Joshua used his brain at the Olympics. That side of his game is there. Has he enough brain against a decent Klitschko?"" Did you know? Anthony Joshua only took up boxing in 2007, five years prior to his Olympic win. He had athletic pedigree though and ran 11.6 seconds for 100m aged 14. This video can not be played Wilder tips Klitschko to beat Joshua WBC world heavyweight champion Deontay Wilder:""My heart is with Joshua, my mind is with Klitschko. I think experience will play its part. With experience you've seen things before and are more able to capitalise when you face them again. ""Can you pull the trigger? Can your body react as fast as you see it? That's the only thing with Klitschko. Sometimes age is nothing but a number and it's about what's in your head."" Did you know? Klitschko weighed in 5lbs lighter than when he lost to Tyson Fury in 2015. Joshua has lived at his Sheffield-based training camp throughout his preparations Promoter Eddie Hearn told BBC Radio 5 live:""There is a chance in this fight Joshua could be completely out of his depth. And there is a chance he goes out there and is the fighter we believe he is and he dismantles Klitschko. ""I love Klitschko because he's a competitor. To tame the young lion would probably be the greatest night of his career. ""If Joshua wins he becomes the biggest star in British sport and in the world of boxing.""

"Ashley Barnes puts Clarets in front - Tarkowski hit by item thrown from crowd during celebration Gray grabs Burnley's second Mike Henson Match of the Day Tune in to Match of the Day tonight at 10.20 BST on BBC One and online. Here's the running order: Southampton v Hull Sunderland v Bournemouth Crystal Palace v Burnley West Brom v Leicester Stoke v West Ham  Crystal Palace 0-2 Burnley Today was the
Clarets' first top-flight win in London since beating QPR 1-0 in January 1975. Big. But where does it rank on the Match of the Day set list?Â I'll leave it with you... Crystal Palace 0-2 Burnley Burnley Burnley manager Sean Dyche:""We have had our fair share of critics on the road in the Premier League and I understand why, but we showed our hunger today. We won the one v one battles, which we knew we would have to do against a team who are on a roll.Â ""I thought that Sam Vokes and Ashley Barnes were magnificent, holding the ball up and putting a real shift in. On whether 39 points will be enough to stay up as Sam Allardyce claimed before the match:""Sam is a lot wiser than me, but we will keep going. That is my mentality, just keeping until the end of the season and then see where we are."" Crystal Palace 0-2 Burnley Crystal Palace Crystal Palace manager Sam Allardyce:""We got nervous today, we started very well, but then fell foul to our inefficiencies, not clearing the box and that goal got the nerves jangling. ""We sorted that at half time and hoped our constant pressure would Â get us back into the game. We made a good recovery but could not find away through a side who defended well and took their chances. ""There were some very strange decisions from the referee that frustrated people today. There were some really poor decisions. I thought tackling from behind was outlawed, I thought that when you were fouled you got a free-kick rather than told to play on. ""We have worked very hard to keep our destiny in our own hands. We have had a big week with Liverpool and Spurs. Burnley have had a full week to prepare and I think that showed today."" ""We have got Manchester City next up, then Hull who are in and around us in the table, we have to get it right."" Crystal Palace 0-2 Burnley Burnley Burnley's Ashley Barnes:""You can see by the boys' reaction that that was a massive win and to do it now in the manner that we did was brilliant. The fans have travelled miles all throughout the season. We know our business is not done yet, there are games to be played and see how high we can go."" Fellow goalscorer Andre Gray:Â ""They were going for the game and looked vulnerable on the counter so we wanted to hang on the shoulder, find the space and exploit that. Every striker wants to score more goals, but it has been more about the team this season. The main thing is staying up."" Who should be top of tonight's Match of the Day running order? Here's Gary Lineker revealing all. BBC app users may need to select the link to watch the video Crystal Palace 0-2 Burnley That victory takes Burnley leap-frogging over the top of Palace, up to 14th and the 39-point mark that should be more than enough to stay in the Premier League next season. Palace have a seven-point head start on Swansea in the final relegation spot. They'll be alright. Won't they? Sam ParkinFormer Luton Town forward on BBC Radio London A little bit toothless from Palace today. Burnley were very comfortable in their 18 yard box - kept getting their head on it and were much the agressors. Palace didnt have any answer to the way they defended either.Â They rallied a bit towards the end but I think Sam Allardyce will point towards the closeness of the recent fixtures.Â Crystal Palace 0-2 Burnley Crystal Palace 0-2 Burnley  Crystal Palace 0-1 Burnley Fraizer Campbell gives away a free-kick in the Burnley box with a needless shove which he defends in vain to referee Robert Madley. The Burnley fans are serenading the Palace supporters who are heading to the exits... Crystal Palace 0-2 Burnley Four minutes to be added on at the end of the 90. Crystal Palace 0-2 Burnley Selhurst Park is emptying fast. A Loic Remy shot loops up tamely off a defender's foot for Tom Heaton to grab. Crystal Palace 0-2 Burnley There is a Palace fan slumped forward in his seat. They will surely get the point or two they need over the remaining three games, but today had been circled as when they could finally put their feet up. Steve Parish looks on with a slightly furrowed brow from up in the gods. Sam ParkinFormer Luton Town forward on BBC Radio London Really intelligent pick out from the Burnley player. Andre Gray's first touch is perfect - chooses to go for power and just drills it into the bottom corner. The travelling Burnley fans are jubilant...Â Crystal Palace 0-2 Burnley That is surely that. Both the end of Burnley's winless away record and their worries about Premier League safety. George Boyd's exquisite outside-of-the-foot pass sets Andre Gray away and the substitute keeps his head down and his nerves steady as he drills a low, hard shot inside Wayne Hennessey's near post. Andre Gray A first away win surely! Crystal Palace 0-1 Burnley Burnley are keeping Palace at arm's length and are surviving. Wilfried Zaha's wicked whipped effort of his instep is deflected over the top off the head of Matthew Lowton. From the resulting set-piece, Patrick van Aanholt bangs a shot clear over the top. Sam ParkinFormer Luton Town forward on BBC Radio London Burnley's fantastic game plan in the first half that caused Palace all kinds of problems has just not worked for them in the second.Â Crystal Palace 0-1 Burnley Andre Gray trots on to replace goalscorer Ashley Barnes for Burnley.

Bolton and Fleetwood still both harbour hopes of joining Sheffield United in the Championship next season, while there is also a play-off place and relegation spot to be decided. Until then, have a very good evening. And in our final game of the afternoon, Bristol City confirmed their Championship survival with victory at promoted Brighton, who missed out on the chance to secure the title. If you missed it, take a look atIan Woodcock's report. The other big story in the EFL this afternoon came at the Matchroom Stadium where Leyton Orient's match with Colchester Unitedfinished behind closed doorsafter a near-two hour delay caused by a pitch invasion by O's fans. Colchester eventually won the game 3-1 after home fans protesting against owner Francesco Becchetti got onto the pitch in the 85th minute. An EFL statement said the game was concluded ""to maintain the integrity of the competition"". FT: Reading 1-0 Wigan Wigan's relegation to League One was confirmed with a 1-0 defeat by Reading, whose place in the play-offs was already assured. Wigan manager Graham Barrow said: ""At the end of the game, I was disappointed because I wanted to
take it to the last weekend. But results went against us elsewhere as well.Â ""I thought we could stay up, I knew it was a long shot, and I was quite proud
of the performance today. But obviously the finishing touch was not there.Â ""The lads have been great for me but clearly it hasn't been enough to keep us
up.Â ""There are things we'll have to look at internally, which haven't been right,
and that's fact. We are where we are, the table tells no lies."" But one relegation was confirmed in the Championship this afternoon as Wigan returned to League One after only one season. FT: QPR 2-0 Nottingham Forest Nottingham Forestâs 2-0 defeat by QPR leaves them 21st in
the Championship, only outside the relegation zone on goal difference. The Reds
host Ipswich in the final game of the season. Nottingham Forest manager Mark Warburton told BBC Radio Nottingham. âWe created chances against a good team, but we didnât take
them, itâs as simple as that. âI was pleased with long aspects of the game, whether it was
four at the back or three at the back, we created space, created chances. Weâve
got to get the rewards, the work ethic, their commitment, their qualityâs evident,

Sunderland 0-1 Bournemouth John MotsonMatch of the Day commentator A club badly managed from above for the last four years. At least three managers have got them out of it at the end of the season.Â The rot set in at Sunderland a long time ago and it came right from the top.Â I have no sympathy with them - they deserved to do down. I just hope somebody, whether it's David Moyes - a new owner perhaps - has got the opportunity to bring them back.Â They have been a great club, they've got great fans but I'm afraid the way the club has been run, they've deserved what they got.Â Sunderland 0-1 Bournemouth Sunderland Is Moyes up for he challenge of trying to get Sunderland back up? ""I think the plan when I sit down with the chairman is to look at how we can get the team back up. This is a great club and I feel for the supporters. We have to try and give them something to cheer about."" Stoke 0-0 West Ham West Ham United West Ham boss Slaven Bilic speaking to BBC Sport: ""We defended as a team and limited them to a couple of
chances. The big one was from Arnautovic but offensively we played really good.
We created four or five chances but the problem is that we didnât score. ""Butland made that save against Ayew which was great reflexes from
him. Brilliant from close range and he made three saves in one action so
big credit for them. ""The clean sheet is giving the defenders a big dose of
self-confidence, but we created more than enough chances to score a goal. ""We want and we need to win games and for that we need to
score goals. But letâs be positive, itâs a good point for us and we are now
four games unbeaten and we are going to approach the remainder of the season in
a positive way."" Sunderland 0-1 Bournemouth Crystal Palace v Burnley (17:30 BST) Just about to get under way at a sunny Selhurst. You can join Mike Henson for the game here.Â Sunderland 0-1 Bournemouth Sunderland Sunderland boss David Moyes speaking to Match of the Day:""It summed up our season. We played well for long parts. We had four or five good opportunities and did a good job. ""Weâre all disappointed and I feel more for the
supporters. We take collective responsibility from top to bottom. ""Weâll dust ourselves down and see what we have to do. ""I don't know what words you can say to the players. I told them
they fought for the jersey. Because of that it's difficult to fault them. ""Weâre disappointed with the level of performance all season. Weâll do
everything we can to get it right."" Sunderland 0-1 Bournemouth Sunderland Sunderland captain John O'Shea:Â ""We had enough chances to take the lead and we were pushing
at the end to get that goal. But then they killed us with the breakaway goal. ""You see the appreciation from the fans but you understand the disappointment.
We never got the momentum. We havenât
got that win at the vital times to put other teams under pressure. ""Sunderland have been here a good few years now and the
attitude will always be the togetherness of a family club.Â ""Thereâs going to be changes in the summer. Iâve never been
in this situation before in my career â itâs obviously disappointing but itâs a
chance for the club to take stock of everything and bounce back and give the

At least three managers have got them out of it at the end of the season.Â The rot set in at Sunderland a long time ago and it came right from the top.Â I have no sympathy with them - they deserved to do down. I just hope somebody, whether it's David Moyes - a new owner perhaps - has got the opportunity to bring them back.Â They have been a great club, they've got great fans but I'm afraid the way the club has been run, they've deserved what they got.Â Sunderland 0-1 Bournemouth Sunderland Is Moyes up for he challenge of trying to get Sunderland back up?

chances. The big one was from Arnautovic but offensively we played really good.
We created four or five chances but the problem is that we didnât score. ""Butland made that save against Ayew which was great reflexes from
him. Brilliant from close range and he made three saves in one action so
big credit for them. ""The clean sheet is giving the defenders a big dose of
self-confidence, but we created more than enough chances to score a goal. ""We want and we need to win games and for that we need to
score goals. But letâs be positive, itâs a good point for us and we are now
four games unbeaten and we are going to approach the remainder of the season in
a positive way."" Sunderland 0-1 Bournemouth Crystal Palace v Burnley (17:30 BST) Just about to get under way at a sunny Selhurst.

supporters. We take collective responsibility from top to bottom. ""Weâll dust ourselves down and see what we have to do. ""I don't know what words you can say to the players. I told them

everything we can to get it right."" Sunderland 0-1 Bournemouth Sunderland Sunderland captain John O'Shea:Â ""We had enough chances to take the lead and we were pushing
at the end to get that goal. But then they killed us with the breakaway goal. ""You see the appreciation from the fans but you understand the disappointment.
We never got the momentum. We havenât
got that win at the vital times to put other teams under pressure. ""Sunderland have been here a good few years now and the
attitude will always be the togetherness of a family club.Â ""Thereâs going to be changes in the summer. Iâve never been

" The landscape of Nepal is a geographical staircase, descending from snow-capped Himalayan mountains, through steep middle hills, to the lush flat plains of the south. In the middle step, in the remote far west of the country, life has changed little over the decades. For 18-year-old Ishwari Joshi, this means doing as her mother and grandmother did before her and leaving her home when she has her period. The practice is called “chhaupadi” - a name for menstruation which also conveys the meaning that a woman is unclean when she is bleeding. “The first time I had my period I was 15. I had to stay out for nine days,” she says. Ishwari's village Dhamilekh clings to an exposed hillside, commanding breathtaking views of high mountains and a low green valley criss-crossed by two rivers. Google Maps About 100 families live here, snugly squeezed together in three-storey, mud-plastered houses. Cattle sleep on the ground floor, families on the middle, while the top floor is used for cooking. When a woman starts her period, she has to leave this warmth for the seclusion of a specially built hut. These are tiny spaces, shared by several families, without proper beds or bedding. When the women are isolated here, they can't cook, eat nutritious food, drink from or bathe in the village water source. They are forbidden from touching plants, cattle or men. “It is said that if we touch a cow, they will not give milk,” says Ishwari's friend Nirmala. “We've never seen anything like that happen, but our elders say we must not touch the cows.” Nirmala and Laxmi Kalpana Joshi, 45, is resigned to her monthly stays in her “chhau” hut, a room little bigger than a crawl space beneath her village shop. “Nothing will happen,” she says, reassuring the younger women who fear attacks by animals and drunk men. A few metres away is the village toilet Kalpana helped build as part of a government drive to stop open defecation. It's out of bounds to her because it's believed she will pollute the water supply. “We're not allowed to touch the toilet because it's the same water we use at home,” she says. “We have to go to the fields far away from the house where nobody can see us.” After four days in the hut, the village women bathe in a stream an hour's walk away and are “purified” with cow urine. Only then can they return to normal life. Ishwari's mother herding cows They say chhaupadi is not enforced as strictly as it used to be, telling stories of mothers and grandmothers who were exiled during their monthly bleed. But even this more relaxed interpretation of chhaupadi is too much for some. “I told my parents, 'I won't go, why should I?',” says 22-year-old Laxmi. “My parents got angry, but my brothers understood so they don't mind if I stay at their house,” she says. Laxmi Laxmi knows her protest is unlikely to continue when she marries and moves into her husband's household, as is the tradition in Nepal. “If the family insists I have to sleep outside, I will have no choice,” she says. “I will be forced to do it.” In the evening twilight, the men in Dhamilekh chat by a fire in front of the village store. There's talk of the new road that reaches the village - a precarious, narrow rock path prone to landslides during the monsoon. The road was built to bring prosperity. But instead it has meant that village men can no longer earn a living carrying goods on their backs, forcing them to India and the Gulf states to work as migrant labourers. With so many men away, the women are needed more than ever to tend to the cattle and bring in the harvest. But the men still believe in the necessity, and power, of chhaupadi. “I used to get sick if my wife touched me during her period - of course I did,” says 74-year-old Shankar Joshi. A younger man, Yagya, also thinks the tradition should continue, but for different reasons. Yagya Joshi “In the old days, people might have said the gods get angry and that's why the practice was followed,” he says. “But I believe it's more about keeping a clean environment and health and safety in the house,” he says, noting that village women only have cloth rags to soak up their flow. “Menstrual blood is a poison,” he says. No-one can pinpoint exactly where the idea that periods are unclean comes from, but it is often attributed to Hindu scriptures. The villagers of Dhamilekh, like 80% of Nepal's population, are Hindus. They look for guidance to priests like Narayan Prasad Pokharel, who sees menstruation as sacred, but also dangerous. Narayan Prasad Pokharel “If the woman does not restrict herself, then the impurities that have been in her body could transfer to the man during sexual intercourse. That will result in terrible diseases,” he says. There is even an annual religious ceremony for women to atone for accidentally touching a man, or polluting their environment. During Rishi Panchami, women fast and bathe in sacred water. Chhaupadi may have its roots in religious scriptures, but it's become a widespread social practice. “There are some communities who do it because they put religion as a reason, but there are some communities that do it because they live in places where it's practised,” says Pema Lhaki, a development worker specialising in reproductive health. Pema Lhaki “So we've had incidences where even Buddhists are doing it because everyone else is,” she says. In 2005, the Nepalese Supreme Court outlawed the practice of chhaupadi. But, especially in the remote far west of the country, traditions are slow to change. And it's not just the men who think women should remain isolated during their periods. “You have to engage with the mothers-in-law,” says Pema Lhaki. “It's a power dynamic. They make sure their daughters-in-law do it because they had to do it.” Hundreds of miles to the east of Dhamilekh's steep hillsides is Nepal's crowded capital, Kathmandu. Here children learn about menstruation at school and women can easily buy sanitary protection. But the taboos surrounding periods have not completely disappeared. Nirmala Limbu and Divya Shrestha are recent graduates in their early 20s. Divya Shrestha and Nirmala Limbu “The rules didn't make sense to me growing up. My mother told me I was not allowed to touch plants, especially fruit trees,” says Nirmala. “I used to keep on touching those plants - none of them died,” she says. For Divya, getting her period meant being banned from attending a religious festival. “I had prepared everything for worship and had worked all day and suddenly I had my period and everyone said we had to purify everything I had touched,” she says. “It was really sad for me as a young girl. Why should I be called impure. It's a natural thing that every woman goes through.” Nepalese society is changing. Although Nirmala and Divya faced some restrictions, they were mild compared with those endured by their mothers. “When we had our periods, people seemed disgusted by us,” says Divya's mother Sudha. “They would keep us apart. We had to use separate plates, wear different clothes. Nobody could touch us,” she says. When Sudha gave birth to Divya, she decided that she could not put her own daughter through the same humiliation. “Even though my family were angry with me, I didn't listen to them. It was my decision,” she says. Because of her mother's determination, Divya grew up largely without restrictions, believing she could live life normally during her period. “It's built up my confidence,” says Divya. “I've got a better education because of it - I have a better position in society.” In Nepal there are now many girls like Divya who are not held back by taboos surrounding periods. But Pema Lhaki, who runs a programme on reproductive health, says that even in the city, old attitudes can be hard to shift. “I feel the biggest danger comes from educated women,” she says. “It's the woman I can meet at a party in Kathmandu who tells me she doesn't go into the kitchen when she's menstruating. “These are the women who are indirectly perpetuating all of this.” In the grasslands of southern Nepal, health worker Laxmi Malla is mounting a small, but determined, campaign to bring an end to chhaupadi. On the plains - known as the Terai - the huts that women must sleep in during their periods are open-sided, with roofs made of straw. It's not unusual to see three or four women sleeping in one small hut, using old clothing for bedding. There's no protection from monsoon rain, or the snakes that inhabit the long grass. Laxmi Malla Laxmi works in the area around the town of Dhanghadi. Here plenty of shops sell sanitary towels, but they are too expensive for the village women, who use balls of cloth instead. “They wash, dry and reuse them,” says Laxmi. “I teach them how to wash them properly - to leave them to dry in the sun to kill off bacteria.” Laxmi's advice on hygiene is readily followed, but when it comes to telling villagers to stop chhaupadi, she's faced angry resistance. “We go door to door,” she says of her campaign which attempts to persuade families that the gods will not be angry if the old ways are abandoned. “It's very difficult. People quarrel with us. They even curse. Most of the time we have to go to villages with the police.” But slowly, over the years, Laxmi has witnessed change in the rural communities she visits. “People are no longer forcing girls to sleep outside,” she says. “I think in our area, the practice of chhaupadi will stop in a year.” Back in the hills of far west Nepal, there has been another drive to end chhaupadi. Over the past two years, the local government and NGOs have helped organise a campaign to tear down the huts in the village of Majhigaun. Devaki Joshi owns the local shop and was part of the organising committee. “In the old days, people didn't shower or wash their clothes so it was more unhygienic during periods - perhaps this is why chhaupadi began,” she says. “But now at school they have a cupboard with sanitary towels for students.” But not everyone has accepted the change. A few houses down from Devaki's shop, Chiutari Sunar sits outside with her mother-in-law. Chiutari Sunar (r) with her mother-in-law “We still follow the same practices,” she says pointing to the space beneath the house where the buffalo are kept. It's her new chhaupadi sleeping spot now her old hut has been demolished. A house in Majhigaun “In our house, when we are menstruating, we can't go inside at any cost, no matter what the government says. This is even more important to me than going to the temple.” Even Devaki, who is enthusiastic about the success of her project, admits that some people may never accept the change. “We don't want to hurt the feelings of the older people like my mother,” she says. “We still don't touch them when we have our period.” Lila Ghale, the local head of the government department for women and children, says it may take another generation before chhaupadi is fully eliminated. “We are working with everyone - men, women and even witch-doctors,” she says. Lila Ghale “Our culture is patriarchal and many women are illiterate which makes it hard to change things.” And, says health worker Pema Lhaki, changing attitudes is not just about telling people chhaupadi is bad. She wants Nepalese girls to celebrate their monthly bleed. “Who says it is impure? It gives life. We tell women there is power in their periods,” she says. “We tell them there's power in your blood.” Built with Shorthand",Negative,4.061119e-08

"Two of Jeremy Corbyn's key allies have not been selected for parliamentary seats under a fast-track process. His political secretary Katy Clark - a former MP - pulled out of the contest for Leigh, the seat Andy Burnham is vacating, at the eleventh hour. A local councillor close to Mr Burnham, Jo Platt, received the nomination. Sam Tarry - a key figure in Mr Corbyn's second leadership campaign - was also passed over for Hull West and Hessle, vacated by Alan Johnson. Mr Corbyn's former speechwriter David Prescott - the son of Lord Prescott - was also not selected for the seat. The chairman of the local Labour party in Leigh, Wigan council leader Lord Smith, had threatened to relinquish his post in protest if Ms Clark had been ""parachuted"" in to the constituency. These nominations could have significance beyond the next election. If Jeremy Corbyn were to decide to stand down before 2022, a left wing successor would need 15% of MPs and MEPs to get on the ballot to replace him. At the moment, someone with similar politics to Mr Corbyn would struggle to get that backing. But with 13 Labour MPs retiring so far, had Mr Corbyn got his allies into most of those seats, the balance could have been tipped more in favour of his wing of the party. Katy Clark pulled out of the contest for Leigh at the last minute Seven members of Labour's governing National Executive Committee, rather than local constituency parties, have been carrying out the selections in what are mostly regarded as ""safe"" seats since Wednesday. Those with links either to the Unite or GMB unions make up the majority. Usually, three of the seven have been involved in each selection and it had been assumed a deal would have been struck to get some of the party leader's picks in place. But independently minded, left-wing NEC member Ann Black was also involved in the process and is unlikely to have been open to union or leadership pressure. Those closer to the party's deputy leader Tom Watson seem to have fared better than prominent leadership supporters - for example, union activist Steph Peacock was chosen in Barnsley to replace leadership critic Michael Dugher. He has tweeted his approval at the choice. David Prescott is the son of former deputy PM Lord Prescott Ellie Reeves - sister of MP Rachel - saw off left-wing Momentum activists to be selected for the London seat of Lewisham West and Penge. That's not to say there aren't Jeremy Corbyn supporters amongst the new crop though. Laura Pidcock, in North West Durham, is seen as firmly on the left, for example. But as one Labour insider put it: ""These are not leadership place men and women. ""For all the talk of stitch-ups, in most seats the panel has chosen the best-placed candidate to win. ""Yes, many have strong trade union links, but many are also councillors and local campaigners."" And in many cases, women have been replacing men who have been standing down. I understand one of the questions candidates were asked was about what they had done for local people in the area they hoped to represent, and this may have counted against those competing from outside. One so-called ""safe"" seat remains to be settled. Steve Rotheram - an MP close to Mr Corbyn - was expected to stand down in Liverpool Walton, as he has been selected as the Labour candidate for the new post of metro Mayor on Merseyside. The seat is being eyed up by Dan Carden, who is close to Unite general secretary Len McCluskey. But Mr Rotheram is said to be reluctant to go unless a local candidate - very possibly the current Liverpool Mayor Joe Anderson - is given the nod, and the impasse hasn't been broken. So, if there is to be a left wing successor to Mr Corbyn, perhaps the best opportunity will come not as a result of new left MPs being returned to Parliament, but at this year's party conference. It will debate whether there should be a change to the leadership rules to make it easier for those close to the current leader to get on the ballot. It would be surprising - whatever the outcome of the election - for Mr Corbyn to stand down before that issue is resolved.

"Andrew Turner had said on 18 April he would be seeking re-election An MP is standing down after reportedly telling students that homosexuality was ""wrong"" and ""dangerous to society"". Andrew Turner, the Conservative MP for the Isle of Wight, was said to have made the remarks on a visit to a college in Newport. They were quickly posted on social media by one of the students, Esther Poucher, 16, who expressed ""outrage"". In a statement, Mr Turner said it was time for ""a new generation"" to take over after his 16 years in Parliament. It comes 10 days after he confirmed he would seek re-election after a period of ill health. This video can not be played Esther Poucher, 16, tells the BBC what made her write the Facebook post Ms Poucher posted at midday that Mr Turner made the comment in reply to her question about the Isle of Wight's first-ever Pride event in July. She said: ""He told us that he'd been invited, but wasn't intending to go... because... he thinks that homosexuality is 'wrong' and 'dangerous to society'. At this answer, I had to leave."" Another student, Toby Sheard, 17, said: ""Everyone was shocked, no-one moved, it was complete silence, all of which he was unfazed by and carried on talking."" Mr Sheard said the MP later explained his conviction was ""to do with religious opinion"". Isle of Wight Pride said: ""Any person who makes such a statement in a public forum as our MP is dangerous. ""Suicide rates amongst LGBT young people are still disproportionately high. Mr Turner did not know if anyone in the room was struggling with their sexuality or gender identity."" Dave Stewart, the Conservative leader of the Isle of Wight Council, said: ""It is very disappointing to hear such comments from someone I know and it is a shame for him to end to his career in this way, but what he said was unacceptable."" Isle of Wight Labour Party condemned Mr Turner's ""contemptible bigotry"" while the island's Green Party said the ""abhorrent"" comments had made his position ""completely untenable"". Mr Turner announced he would stand down five hours after Ms Poucher's Facebook post. He said: ""After 16 years I have come to the decision that it is time for a new generation to take up the mantle of representing my fantastic constituents.""

"This video can not be played Joshua & Klitschko face off before heavyweight boxing showdown Anthony Joshua v Wladimir Klitschko Date:Saturday, 29 April Venue: Wembley StadiumTime:22:00 BST Coverage:Live commentary on BBC Radio 5 live from 21:00 BST and text updates on the BBC Sport website and app from 20:00 BST. IBF heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua believes he will take ""another step towards greatness"" when he meets Wladimir Klitschko in the richest bout in British boxing history. Joshua, 27, will defend his title and bid for the vacant WBA strap in front of a post-war record boxing crowd of 90,000 at Wembley Stadium in just his 19th professional fight. Klitschko, 41, was unbeaten in 11 years prior todefeat to Tyson Furyin his last fight in November 2015 and says he is ""obsessed"" with overcoming the Briton. ""I will always stand up to the competition,"" said Joshua. ""There is no fear at all which trembles through the body."" ""You can talk about experience but even when I faced guys with less experience I took them as world championship fights. I have prepared since day one for this. ""April 29 is just another stepping stone towards greatness."" Joshua weighed in at 17st 12lbs on Friday - the heaviest of his career and some 10lbs more than Klitschko, who came in 5lbs lighter than when he faced Tyson Fury in November 2015.

This video can not be played Joshua v Klitschko: Crowds packed in to Wembley Arena for open workout The Â£30m showdown between the former sparring partners has been dubbed a fight for ""the history books"" by Joshua's promoter Eddie Hearn. It will be expected to sell roughly a million times on pay-per-view television in the UK, is being broadcast in Germany and has achieved a rare feat in the US market as rival broadcasters Showtime and HBO will both transmit the bout. ""Only twice before have they done it - Lennox Lewis versus Mike Tyson and Floyd Mayweather versus Manny Pacquiao,"" said Hearn. Klitschko has already fought in the US a dozen times but Joshua, who looks destined to follow the likes of Lewis into US-based super bouts, is yet to fight professionally outside of the UK. ""He has the ultimate test,"" added Hearn.  ""A test which should come maybe after 27 or 28 fights. Why risk it now? He wants to challenge himself. Is he the guy everyone talks about as the future of boxing?"" Joshua's calorie intake varies on training Joshua's procession to a world title - captured in just 34 career rounds when hefloored American Charles Martin in 2016- has led to him being installed as odds-on-favourite against Klitschko with bookmakers. He has contested just 44 rounds as a professional, a tally surpassed by Klitschko in his last five fights alone, with the 41-year-old Ukrainian hardened by 358 rounds as a pro, spanning 68 fights, 64 wins and more than 20 years. Indeed, London 2012 gold medallist Joshua was only six when Klitschko topped the podium at the 1996 Atlanta Games. In the pro game, he has felt the heat of a world title fight three times, this will be Klitschko's 29th. With both men similar in stature, the gap in age and experience has been central to much of the pre-fight debate. Joshua's trainer Rob McCracken said: ""As good as Klitschko has been, Father Time is a terrible person when he shows up and I think he already has. ""It is going to be tough for Wladimir, he doesn't know himself if it's still there or not. He's against a ferocious opponent on Saturday night, that's for sure."" Klitschko can be destructive too. His tally of 53 knockouts surpasses the great Joe Louis by one and the wrecking ball that was Mike Tyson by nine. In 2013, he dropped the respected Alexander Povetkin four times. The Russian had never lost and has not done so since. Klitschko is adamant his career will not fade after defeat to Fury and he has come back from torment before after losing world title fights to the likes of Corrie Sanders in 2003 and Lamon Brewster a year later. ""Nobody is perfect,"" Klitschko's brother Vitali told BBC Radio 5 live. ""Everyone has strong sides and weak sides. Wladimir's weak side is his concentration. ""That cost him the title against Fury. I've never seen him focused like this. If he is concentrating 100%, Joshua does not have a chance. Wladimir understands this is the fight of his life."" This video can not be played Klitschko records Joshua fight prediction on USB Radio 5 live boxing boxing pundit Steve Bunce Can Joshua go seven, eight, nine rounds, hard rounds? Will he still look as invincible in round seven or eight as he has in 18 fights? Can Wladimir look like any of the old Wladimirs? Even a bad old Wladimir should be enough to beat this kid Anthony Joshua. The worst Wladimir you've seen win a 12-round stinking fight should be enough. I think an awful lot has been placed on the assumption, the dream, hope, that Wladimir, at 41 has nothing left. If that's not the case then we are in for a tricky night. Joshua has documented his gruelling training regime on social media While Joshua's social media offerings have showcased chats with celebrities such as Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson and American rap artist Dr. Dre in recent weeks, footage of his gruelling training regime has also been free flowing. Reaction drills such as dodging agility sticks to chase tennis balls, intense sessions on a watt bike and workouts in a leg-sapping sand pit have all been captured on camera. The hard work calls fora diet,externalof between 4,000 and 5,000 calories a day - a stark difference to NHS guidelines of 2,500 for men. Smoothies form a key part of his diet in order to increase his calorie intake and replace fluids lost when sweating, as it is not uncommon for Joshua to lose 3kg through sweat alone during a session. So if you want to start your Saturday in the same way the champion begins a training day, opt for a healthy smoothie, workout and then follow up with as many as five eggs on wholemeal bread.

"How did we go so wrong as a nation that something the baby boomer generation took for granted - being able to buy a decent-sized family home - now appears out of reach for so many of their children? That's the question I was trying to answer in Liverpool this week as part of the Today programme's series of reports on big election issues. Housing is one of them, for obvious reasons: the gap between the number of new homes needed in England and those available is estimated at 100,000 a year. While our politicians are quick to acknowledge the problem, it's far less clear if the solutions they propose will deliver change on the required scale. In the meantime,the experience of 33-year-old Michael Sergison tells a bigger story. At first glance he appears to have everything going for him; he and his new wife both have stable jobs - his in a Liverpool lettings agency, hers in a local hospital. But for the last few years, they've been living with his parents, trying to save enough for a deposit on a house. Recently married Michael Sergison is struggling to find an affordable house to buy in Merseyside After they got married last month, that situation no longer felt right. ""We wanted to move out. Not straight away, but as a married couple we feel as if we should be on our own, rather than with my mum and dad."" Having spent a lot of their savings on their wedding in Las Vegas last month, the only option was to rent. The day I met Michael he was in the process of moving into a one-bedroom flat, with his father, also Michael Sergison, helping him out. Michael Senior is quick to reflect on the contrast between his son's situation and what he could do at the same age: he and his wife paid Â£10,500 for their first home, a three-bedroom semi, in 1978. The home that Michael Junior and his wife Francine dream of buying in Liverpool is upwards of Â£200,000: on a combined salary of Â£40,000 per annum, they could be years away from it. Labour pledges to build 1m new homes More affordable housing promised in White Paper Where can I afford to live? For now, they're out of his parents' home and into one that belongs to someone else - his landlady Sue Earle, whose experience of the housing market also tells a bigger story. She is a buy-to-let investor and sees the flat as a way to safeguard her future. ""I own two properties with my brother, which we purchased just to rent out. ""We both have successful careers, but we felt we needed to make sure that we have additional funds when we retire."" She hopes the rental income, of about Â£530 per month, will pay off the mortgage within ten years. After that, she could continue to let the flat out, or sell it at a profit. Sue says she knows what it's like to have to save for a deposit, and worked hard to build up the funds that enabled her three mortgages. For Michael, it's all about that first step on the housing ladder, for which his work at the lettings agency is not only crucial to his earnings, but also a valuable insight into the property market. The Council of Mortgage Lenders says that the UK's housing market is in ""neutral gear"" His manager at Belvoir Sales & Lettings, Adam Rastall, thinks the government should look at particular points where the market seizes up. ""I would focus more on the OAPs and the baby boomers and look for appropriate and suitable housing for them in the future. ""If we can help the older generation find suitable accommodation and give them incentives to move, then that would free up some good-quality housing for the younger generation."" I thought immediately of the older Michael Sergison, who has just retired from his work as a pipe-fitter and is living with his wife in a four-bedroom house. But downsizing? Not a chance. ""It's not our fault. When you get to a certain age you think 'why should I?' he explained to me. ""Whatever incentive they offered me, it just wouldn't work.  I'm quite happy where I am."" Not surprisingly, Michael Senior wants to enjoy the house - and garden - that is the fruit of his own working life. He looks around his son's one-bedroom flat and struggles to imagine it as home. ""I couldn't live in this. I'd go stir crazy,"" he says. But he knows this is the reality for many thousands of younger people. As far as the younger Michael is concerned, he's looking to the future, satisfied to be making the right start to married life. ""I'm happy that we've got a place to call our own. It's not our house or our flat, but we'll make it our home.""

"As the leaders of the EU's remaining 27 member states prepare for the first Brexit summit in Brussels, which issues will shape the agendas of the individual countries taking part? Chancellor Angela Merkel is keen to emphasise that Brexit negotiations are between Britain and the EU but Germany's position will assume a significance above and beyond most - perhaps all - of the other member states. This is partly because of its economic and political weight in the union but also because, unlike many other countries, it has the resources, the people and the expertise to analyse and work through the administrative complexities of deconstructing Britain's membership. For a nation that considers itself to be European first, German second, the priority is now the future security of the EU. Berlin wants to present a united European front in the negotiations, so it's likely to stick to a script agreed with the big EU institutions. Expect a firm line too from Berlin on the rights of EU citizens living in Britain. While there is concern in Berlin about the impact of what one German newspaper called ""Britain's leap into the dark"", and an acknowledgement of, in Mrs Merkel's words, the ""enormity and complexity"" of the negotiations ahead, but politicians in Berlin worry about the bigger picture too. Mrs Merkel has made it clear all along that she wants to get on with tackling other challenges facing the union; migration, terrorism, youth unemployment, the impact of digitisation and so on. And, she said on Thursday that, in a world of global challenges, Europe could not afford to be introspective now. Berlin didn't want Britain to leave - but, now that the decision's made, it wants ""fair and constructive"" exit negotiations to be concluded quickly and cleanly. But it's unlikely to support talks over the shape of the future relationship between the UK and the EU unless Britain first agrees the terms of its exit - ie commits to paying that ""Brexit bill"". Angela Merkel welcomed Theresa May's remarks that Britain wanted to see a strong Europe There is, in reality, little appetite here for a punitive approach. Berlin wishes to preserve its strong economic relationship with the UK. But don't expect Germany to be a soft negotiating partner either. Even business leaders - among them the head of the association of Germany's all-powerful car manufacturers - acknowledge the EU's interests must come first. Mrs Merkel has warned against the ""illusion"" the UK can retain or even negotiate better rights than member states. In Angela Merkel's response to the triggering of Article 50 last month, she chose first to commit to minimising the personal impact of Brexit on EU citizens living in the UK. And she is expected to seek to protect what she sees as those vital founding freedoms of the EU. She has repeatedly insisted that there can be no access to the single market without freedom of movement of people - a red line upon which many will seek to compromise but upon which she is likely to stand firm. France is in the middle of presidential elections, and will have a new head of state in early May. The two candidates havevery different views of the European Union - and of Brexit. If Marine Le Pen of the Front National is elected, all bets are off. She is vehemently anti-EU, and thinks the UK's departure is not to be regretted but applauded. With Ms Le Pen in the Elysee, the chaos created by Brexit would quickly be eclipsed as Brussels struggled to cope with a much greater threat - Frexit. But realistically, Marine Le Pen's chances are small. Far more probable is a President Emmanuel Macron. Mr Macron is fervently pro-European. In recent months, he has spoken out strongly about how the UK must not be allowed special treatment in its negotiations with Brussels. Echoing the outgoing President Francois Hollande, he says favours to London would betray the spirit of the EU and encourage populism. Despite his fervent support for the EU, might a President Macron actually support a softer version of Brexit? The obvious conclusion is that he would take a tough line in the talks on Brexit. But another interpretation suggests he might actually make life easier for the UK's negotiators. This is because on many issues Mr Macron is in agreement with the UK. He is economically liberal, pro-trade and pro-business. He understands the City. Hope for this more favourable view comes from a policy paper co-written by Mr Macron's top adviser, Jean Pisani-Ferry. In it, he argues for a ""continental partnership"" with the UK, in which London would have access to the single market (and pay into the EU budget) but win back control over movement of workers. This is seen as a very soft version of Brexit. Optimists say that a Macron victory would be seen as the start of a rollback against populism in Europe. A more confident Brussels establishment would then be more likely to reach a generous deal with London. Poles make up the largest non-British nationality living in the UK, so the first priority for the Polish government is to secure the rights of those 850,000 Polish citizens. It's thought that many of those Poles have not been living in Britain long enough to claim permanent residency, so there's a great deal of uncertainty among them about their future rights post-Brexit. Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlo has argued there is no place for a ""multi-speed Europe"" Warsaw wants to be seen to be protecting its citizens' current status, including their access to UK social benefits. Essentially, it wants the current rules to remain in force. Those workers' earnings are important for the Polish economy. Each year, they send home an estimated $1bn (Â£780m). Another pressing concern is securing the UK's contribution to the EU budget. Poland is the biggest recipient of funds - 106bn euro (Â£90bn) under the 2014-20 EU budget, to which the UK is a significant contributor. Those funds have transformed the infrastructure landscape of Poland, and helped drive the country's economic growth. Warsaw hopes Brexit will not mean less money in the pot. Before the referendum, Poland named Britain as its number one partner in the EU. It insists the UK will remain a strong ally, especially in areas such as defence and Nato cooperation. Russia's annexation of Crimea and the war in eastern Ukraine have increased concerns in Poland and the Baltic states about security. British soldiers have been deployed to the region and are taking part in the defence of Nato's eastern flank, a contribution that Warsaw values. So often the rock of contention, Gibraltar looms large over the impending Brexit negotiations. Spain lobbied hard to ensure that the British overseas territorywas specifically mentioned in the European Council's draft guidance document,external, which states that Madrid can veto the application of an agreement between the EU and the UK to Gibraltar. Since Spain joined the EU, Gibraltar has been able to call on Brussels to intervene when it felt Spain was squeezing traffic unreasonably at the land border, charges Madrid has consistently denied, citing security concerns. Gibraltarians voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU Now, there will have to be an agreement between Britain and Spain to apply the eventual Brexit terms of trade and movement of people to and from the British overseas territory. Spain has proposed joint sovereignty, something Gibraltarians have traditionally rejected out of hand. But aside from grandstanding on the Rock, Spain has many reasons to make Brexit as soft as possible. The Spanish consulate in London says 130,000 Spaniards live in Britain. On the other side, 309,000 British citizens are registered as residents in Spain. Here, the two countries will seek reciprocity on a deal making migrants' lives comfortable. Tourism is Spain's leading economic driver. According to the Spanish government, 23% of the 75 million foreign tourists who visited the country in 2016 came from Britain. There are strong financial links between the two countries too. Spanish company Ferrovial operates Heathrow and several other UK airports. Santander says 20% of its profits in 2016 came from its UK banking operations. Spain consistently runs a healthy trade surplus with the UK. Madrid has said it will work for an amicable deal with Britain, but the shadow of an impending row over applying it to Gibraltar threatens to be a major political stumbling block. Expats, exports, security - these will be Italy's three immediate Brexit negotiation priorities. Italy's embassy in the UK estimates there could be up to 600,000 Italians living in the UK,while it is thought that only 30,000 Britons live in Italy. Many of the Italians living in Britain are young graduates who cannot find work at home. Italy will want to safeguard their rights - and  find a way to ensure future graduates can continue to look for work in the UK. Then, Italy will want to make sure that it is able to carry on selling its goods to the UK. Britain is currently Italy's fourth biggest export market. In 2015, Italy exported 22.5bn euro (Â£19bn) worth of goods to the UK including cars, machinery, clothes, and the sparkling wine prosecco. HMS Bulwark worked with the Italian navy and coastguard to rescue migrants in the Mediterranean Italy will also seek to maintain a security alliance with Britain, particularly in the Mediterranean. As an EU member, Britain has taken part in anti-smuggling operations off the Italian coast. Italy and the UK have also worked together in efforts to stabilise Libya. Brexit also presents a number of opportunities for Italy. The EU must decide the fate of its agencies currently based in the UK. Milan is taking part in the unofficial competition to take over as the host of the European Banking Agency and the European Medicines Agency. It's never fun watching your best friend go through a break-up, and it gets a lot more complicated when you've got a bunch of friends in common. That's the position Sweden finds itself in, as its closest ally prepares to divorce itself from the EU. The two countries have shared the same perspective on 90% of votes in the European Council, and the UK is the Nordic nation's fifth biggest export partner. Ever-efficient Sweden has made no secret of its desire for negotiations on a new trade agreement with the UK to start as soon as possible. But its first priority is clarity on the future rights of EU citizens to live, work and study in a post-Brexit Britain. Sweden's European Affairs Minister, Ann Linde, has criticised the application process for Swedes who want permanent UK residency According to the Swedish government, more than 100,000 Swedes, from a population of just 10 million, are based in the UK, and about 1,000 Swedish businesses operate there. Sweden's Minister for European Affairs and Trade, Ann Linde, has been openly critical of the challenges facing Europeans seeking permanent residency in the UK under current rules, which include filling out an 85-page document and providing evidence of steady work. While Sweden's centre-left government has said it wants to make sure its old friend gets a ""fair deal"" in the negotiations, it has made clear that keeping the rest of the 27-member bloc intact is its core goal, a message shared by the country's centre-right opposition parties. But public support for the anti-immigration Sweden Democrats - who are pushing for a ""Swexit""- has crept up to about 19%, with just over a year to go before the country's next general election. Meanwhile, Sweden has seen a huge spike in citizenship applications from British expats anxious to guarantee their future in Scandinavia, with 1,616 forms submitted in 2016, three times the total of the previous year, 511. A ""self-inflicted wound"" is how one bewildered Dutch columnist described Brexit. The UK has historically been one of the Netherlands' closest allies. Exports between the two run into the tens of billions of euros. A comprehensive free trade agreement will be a priority - the Dutch government's biggest fear is having to fall back on the World Trade Organization tariffs. But bear in mind, the Netherlands was one of the first recruits to the EU club of nations and about 80% of the country's GDP comes from exports, most of which (79%) are within Europe. The strength of Britain's relationship with this small but influential ally could prove critical in determining the nature of the final deal. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said his general election victory showed voters had chosen a path of safety and stability In fact, the pragmatic Dutch could emerge as mediators. They are the masters of compromise, proud of their ability to put differences aside to work together in the common interest, to literally dig the land out of the sea. They have their people to think about too. The Dutch foreign minister told the BBC that securing the rights of the approximately 100,000 Dutch citizens who lived in the UK was a top priority in the negotiations. And the Britons based in the Netherlands are anxious to be afforded the same protections. The domestic political landscape could also influence the Dutch stance. Eurosceptic parties performed well in the recent election. They were emboldened by Brexit, despite the fact support for a ""Nexit"" fell after Britain demonstrated the complications involved in extricating oneself from the EU. The Dutch dilemma will be how to maintain the valuable economic, cultural and political links with the UK without bolstering the eurosceptics at home and across the continent who want to destroy their lucrative club.

"This video can not be played Joshua & Klitschko face off before heavyweight boxing showdown Anthony Joshua v Wladimir Klitschko Date:Saturday, 29 April Venue: Wembley StadiumTime:22:00 BST Coverage:Live commentary on BBC Radio 5 live from 21:00 BST and text updates on the BBC Sport website and app from 20:00 BST. IBF heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua believes he will take ""another step towards greatness"" when he meets Wladimir Klitschko in the richest bout in British boxing history. Joshua, 27, will defend his title and bid for the vacant WBA strap in front of a post-war record boxing crowd of 90,000 at Wembley Stadium in just his 19th professional fight. Klitschko, 41, was unbeaten in 11 years prior todefeat to Tyson Furyin his last fight in November 2015 and says he is ""obsessed"" with overcoming the Briton. ""I will always stand up to the competition,"" said Joshua. ""There is no fear at all which trembles through the body."" ""You can talk about experience but even when I faced guys with less experience I took them as world championship fights. I have prepared since day one for this. ""April 29 is just another stepping stone towards greatness."" Joshua weighed in at 17st 12lbs on Friday - the heaviest of his career and some 10lbs more than Klitschko, who came in 5lbs lighter than when he faced Tyson Fury in November 2015. Anthony Joshua: The Road to Klitschko Radio 5 live boxing podcast: 'Great British fight nights' Klitschko's memory stick mind games won't faze me - Joshua Is Joshua the perfect heavyweight? This video can not be played Joshua v Klitschko: Crowds packed in to Wembley Arena for open workout The Â£30m showdown between the former sparring partners has been dubbed a fight for ""the history books"" by Joshua's promoter Eddie Hearn. It will be expected to sell roughly a million times on pay-per-view television in the UK, is being broadcast in Germany and has achieved a rare feat in the US market as rival broadcasters Showtime and HBO will both transmit the bout. ""Only twice before have they done it - Lennox Lewis versus Mike Tyson and Floyd Mayweather versus Manny Pacquiao,"" said Hearn. Klitschko has already fought in the US a dozen times but Joshua, who looks destined to follow the likes of Lewis into US-based super bouts, is yet to fight professionally outside of the UK. ""He has the ultimate test,"" added Hearn.  ""A test which should come maybe after 27 or 28 fights. Why risk it now? He wants to challenge himself. Is he the guy everyone talks about as the future of boxing?"" Joshua's calorie intake varies on training Joshua's procession to a world title - captured in just 34 career rounds when hefloored American Charles Martin in 2016- has led to him being installed as odds-on-favourite against Klitschko with bookmakers. He has contested just 44 rounds as a professional, a tally surpassed by Klitschko in his last five fights alone, with the 41-year-old Ukrainian hardened by 358 rounds as a pro, spanning 68 fights, 64 wins and more than 20 years. Indeed, London 2012 gold medallist Joshua was only six when Klitschko topped the podium at the 1996 Atlanta Games. In the pro game, he has felt the heat of a world title fight three times, this will be Klitschko's 29th. With both men similar in stature, the gap in age and experience has been central to much of the pre-fight debate. Joshua's trainer Rob McCracken said: ""As good as Klitschko has been, Father Time is a terrible person when he shows up and I think he already has. ""It is going to be tough for Wladimir, he doesn't know himself if it's still there or not. He's against a ferocious opponent on Saturday night, that's for sure."" Klitschko can be destructive too. His tally of 53 knockouts surpasses the great Joe Louis by one and the wrecking ball that was Mike Tyson by nine. In 2013, he dropped the respected Alexander Povetkin four times. The Russian had never lost and has not done so since. Klitschko is adamant his career will not fade after defeat to Fury and he has come back from torment before after losing world title fights to the likes of Corrie Sanders in 2003 and Lamon Brewster a year later. ""Nobody is perfect,"" Klitschko's brother Vitali told BBC Radio 5 live. ""Everyone has strong sides and weak sides. Wladimir's weak side is his concentration. ""That cost him the title against Fury. I've never seen him focused like this. If he is concentrating 100%, Joshua does not have a chance. Wladimir understands this is the fight of his life."" This video can not be played Klitschko records Joshua fight prediction on USB Radio 5 live boxing boxing pundit Steve Bunce Can Joshua go seven, eight, nine rounds, hard rounds? Will he still look as invincible in round seven or eight as he has in 18 fights? Can Wladimir look like any of the old Wladimirs? Even a bad old Wladimir should be enough to beat this kid Anthony Joshua. The worst Wladimir you've seen win a 12-round stinking fight should be enough. I think an awful lot has been placed on the assumption, the dream, hope, that Wladimir, at 41 has nothing left. If that's not the case then we are in for a tricky night. Joshua has documented his gruelling training regime on social media While Joshua's social media offerings have showcased chats with celebrities such as Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson and American rap artist Dr. Dre in recent weeks, footage of his gruelling training regime has also been free flowing. Reaction drills such as dodging agility sticks to chase tennis balls, intense sessions on a watt bike and workouts in a leg-sapping sand pit have all been captured on camera. The hard work calls fora diet,externalof between 4,000 and 5,000 calories a day - a stark difference to NHS guidelines of 2,500 for men. Smoothies form a key part of his diet in order to increase his calorie intake and replace fluids lost when sweating, as it is not uncommon for Joshua to lose 3kg through sweat alone during a session.
