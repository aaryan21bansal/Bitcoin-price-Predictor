"Furloughed workers may be encouraged to work as fruit and vegetable pickers to help farmers fill a labour shortage, the environment secretary has said. George Eustice told the daily Number 10 coronavirus briefing that only a third of the usual workforce was available. Many more would be needed in the summer and ""we are working with industry to identify an approach"" to get furloughed employees to help, he said. Much of the work would normally be done by seasonal migrant labourers. According to the British Growers Association, 70,000 seasonal staff a year are needed. However farmers say the pandemic has restricted the availability of foreign workers and have complained they cannot recruit enough domestic labour. Earlier this month special charter flights were arranged to fly in workers from Romania. Mr Eustice did not spell out how furloughed workers would be recruited. He said the international food chain is continuing to work well, but added the government was ""acutely aware"" that the British season for soft fruits and salads was about to begin. Mr Eustice estimated only about a third of the migrant labourers who normally work in the UK are in the country - and they arrived before lockdown. ""We are working with industry to identify an approach that will encourage those millions of furloughed workers in some cases to consider taking a second job, helping get the harvest in in June."" He added: ""It's not an issue at the moment since the harvest has barely begun, but we do anticipate that there will be a need to recruit staff for those sectors in the month of June."" Farm workers to be flown in from Eastern Europe Five ways coronavirus is disrupting the food industry Shops preparing ways to reopen amid coronavirus Shadow Environment Secretary Luke Pollard said the government needed to explain what support it could offer those working in the food supply sector, in particular farmers who are worried about their crops rotting in fields due to lack of agricultural labour. Furloughed staff have the right to seek work elsewhere during the shutdown as long as they have the permission of their main employer and are able to complete any training required of them while stood down. Guidance published on the government's website says those on furlough who take on new work must be ready to return to their normal job at any time and must complete the relevant paperwork making their situation clear to the tax authority Mr Eustice also told the briefing that food availability is improving, with both staffing levels in supermarkets and online delivery slots increasingly. Many food retail staff who had been self-isolating through suspected coronavirus have returned to work, he said. ""Absence levels are down from a peak of typically 20% in food businesses three weeks ago, to less than 10% at the end of last week, and, in some cases, individual companies reporting absences as low as 6%."" And UK supermarkets are adding an extra 300,000 delivery slots, following complaints, especially from vulnerable shoppers, that they were unable to book online slots. There were 2.1 million delivery slots at the beginning of the Covid-19 lockdown, a figure that increased to 2.6 million as demand soared. Mr Eustice confirmed it is now increasing to 2.9 million, although he admitted this may still not be enough to meet demand. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

"The rate of increase of helpline calls has been growing (Picture posed by model) Calls to a national domestic abuse helpline rose by 49% and killings doubled weeks after lockdown, a report by MPs has revealed. Following the ""surge"" in violence, the report called for a government strategy on domestic abuse during the pandemic. MPs also said ""safe spaces"", where victims can seek help, should be rolled out to supermarkets and other shops. The Home Office said it was increasing funding to support helplines and online services. Researchers at the Counting Dead Women Project told MPs 14 women and two children had been killed in the first three weeks of lockdown. The figure is the largest number of killings in a three-week period for 11 years and more than double the average rate, they said. Meanwhile, the number of calls to the National Domestic Abuse helpline run by Refuge was25% above average in the second week of lockdownand 49% higher than normal after three weeks.  16people killed in first three weeks - highest is 11 years 49%rise in calls to abuse helpline, compared with average 35%rise in calls to Men's Advice Line, in first week Male victims of abuse have also been calling for help in greater numbers, with the Men's Advice Line seeing calls rise 35% in the first week of lockdown. Domestic abuse services to get Â£2m amid lockdown Met making 100 domestic violence arrests a day 'I'm in coronavirus lockdown with my abuser' Without a comprehensive government strategy to cope with the consequences of this violence, the home affairs select committee said ""we will be dealing with serious consequences for a generation"". It said the strategy should include raising awareness, prevention, victim support, housing and a criminal justice response, supported with dedicated funding and ministerial leadership. MPs have also called for more help to allow victims access support at times when they may be unable to use the phone or ask friends for help. That could include expanding the Safe Spaces scheme piloted in pharmacies, where victims can indicate to staff they need help, to other shops such as supermarkets. Staying home was essential to prevent coronavirus spreading, said Yvette Cooper, chairwoman of the committee. But ""for some people home isn't safe"" and ""urgent action"" was needed to protect them. While the government's national public information campaign is welcome, she said it ""needs to go much further"". ""Things are particularly hard for vulnerable children. We can't abandon them in the middle of this crisis,"" Ms Cooper said. The committee said there will also be an ""acute"" need for support when restrictions are eased, as victims may face escalating violence if they try to leave. ""The emotional, physical and social scars from domestic abuse can last a lifetime,"" said Ms Cooper. The report also highlighted a lack of space in refuges, with 64% of requests for a space for victims declined in 2018-19. Sandra Horley, chief executive of Refuge, said the need for funding had ""never been greater"", with cuts since 2010 having ""decimated"" services while the pandemic has sent demand soaring. ""All women who need to escape during lockdown and beyond must be assured of a safe place to stay with specialist support,"" she said. This should also apply, she added, to those with people with insecure immigration status who are not allowed to access most government benefits. Safeguarding Minister Victoria Atkins said that as well as a national awareness-raising campaign, the government was providing additional funding for helplines and online support, and was helping charities access some ofthe Â£750m aid announced by the chancellorearlier this month. ""The government has prioritised those at risk of domestic abuse in this national health emergency,"" she said.

"Coronavirus has led to a ""global slowdown"" in the removal of internet child abuse images, say campaigners. The Internet Watch Foundation says tech firms have fewer staff to delete illegal material, making it easier for sexual predators to view and share. Almost 90% fewer suspicious web addresses, or URLs, have been deleted during the pandemic, says the charity. The warning comes as the IWF's annual report reveals Europe is the ""hub"" for child sexual abuse photos and videos. In 2019, 89% of URLs containing abuse material were found on computer servers based in Europe, compared with 79% in 2018. Servers in the Netherlands, which has a strong technological infrastructure and low costs, hosted the most illegal content discovered by IWF staff - 93,962 URLs, or 71% of the total. ""We have seen a real and frightening jump in the amount of child sexual abuse material that is being hosted right on our doorstep here in Europe,"" IWF chief executive Susie Hargreaves said. Record number of child sex abuse images dealt with The team fighting to remove online child abuse images Countries must adopt a ""zero tolerance"" strategy to the problem by tackling supply and demand, Ms Hargreaves added. ""While the UK doesn't have this 'hosting' issue, our problem is that many consumers of child sexual abuse live here,"" she pointed out. She praised staff at the charity who last year removed 132,676 web pages and newsgroups showing child sexual abuse material, after assessing reports from people across the globe. ""It doesn't matter how often the team sees this content, they never lose their humanity or fail to be shocked by the level of depravity and cruelty that some, a minority, engage in,"" she said. The immediate problem identified by the IWF is that social-distancing and self-isolation rules have cut the number of staff able to flag and respond to reports of illegal content in technology companies, call centres and law enforcement. As a result, it is taking longer for child abuse images to be removed. Between 16 March and 15 April, 1,498 URLs were deleted compared with 14,947 in the previous four weeks. ""Hotlines and abuse teams across the globe need to be aware there is a slowdown of this content being removed and to be mindful of doing what they can, within their ability, to get this content taken down,"" the charity said.

"The military has started testing essential workers in the UK for coronavirus in mobile units operating in ""hard to reach"" areas. At least 96 new pop-up facilities, which will travel to care homes, police and fire stations, prisons and benefits centres, are planned in total. Eleven of those mobile sites are up-and-running in areas including Salisbury, Carlisle and Watford. It comes as the government aims to reach 100,000 tests a day by Thursday. The latest figures released by the government reveal a running total of 20,732 deaths of people with coronavirus, not including those in English care homes, which are collated separately. The 'good outcome' that never was UK hospital coronavirus deaths pass 20,000 How close is the UK to 100,000 tests a day? Are you a key worker trying to get a test? Email:haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external There were 29,058 tests carried out on Saturday, an increase from the 28,760 tests carried out the day before, but still far short of the government's daily target of 100,000 - which it aims to achieve by the end of April. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show the government has to ""ramp testing right up"" but added it was ""on track"" to hit its target. ""We have certainly got to get the daily testing right up to hundreds of thousands which, along with the tracking and tracing, gives usâ¦ more flexibility because we can open up measures, open up access,"" Mr Raab said. ""That, along with the vaccine and therapeutics will be the medium to long-term way of dealing with coronavirus sustainably and responsibly for good."" Drive-through testing facilities have been set up around the country Some health and care workers have previously reportedhaving to make long journeys to their nearest drive-through testing centres. Many care homes have said none of their staff have been tested, while others have spoken of struggles to access official test centres after reporting online they have symptoms. Of 210 care providers contacted by the BBC earlier this week, 159 said none of their workers had been tested. Environment Secretary George Eustice said at the daily government press briefing that the capacity for testing has risen to more than 50,000 a day, adding that ""significant numbers"" of people in care homes are obtaining tests. The new pop-up facilities, which can be set up in 20 minutes, see swabs collected by ""specially trained"" military personnel and taken to one of three ""mega labs"" to be processed, with results expected within 48 hours. The number of units is being scaled up after a successful pilot last week. An extra 80 or so units, expected to be running by the start of May, will travel to areas where there was ""significant demand"", the government said. The armed forces will staff 92 of the units, while civilian contractors will operate a further four located in Northern Ireland, the DHSC said. And mobile units set up by the military to carry out tests at care homes will be in operation in Scotland by next week, the Scottish health secretary has said. Jeane Freeman told the BBC's Sunday Politics Scotland: ""We anticipate in the coming week we will have five of those and that is to be followed by a further eight."" The UK has come a long way on testing. When the first cases of coronavirus emerged, the government was reliant on eight Public Health England labs, which could carry out little more than 1,000 tests a day. That then expanded to include hospital labs, before a network of drive-through testing centres was created - there are around 30, but they will increase to nearly 50 soon - supported by three mega-labs for processing tests. The aim is to get to the target of 100,000 tests a day by the end of the month. But as the range of people entitled to testing has increased, one of the issues has been ensuring it is available close to where people need it. A drive-through centre 30 miles from a care worker who does not have access to a car is of little use for example. The pop-up testing centres run by the military, which are also coinciding with the development of home testing kits, are an attempt to remedy that and ensure the full testing capacity is used. Currently only around half the 50,000 available tests on any given day are being carried out. Prof John Newton, who is co-ordinating coronavirus testing for the government, said the new mobile testing units would help achieve the goal of performing 100,000 tests a day by ""providing tests to vital frontline workers wherever they need them"". He said efforts to increase capacity had resulted in ""scores of new testing facilities and Britain's largest network of diagnostic labs in history"". Since Friday, millions of key workers and people they live with have been able to book appointments online to be tested. Those too ill to travel should also be able to order home kits - although numbers are limited. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash STRESS:How to look after your mental health On Sunday morning home kits were no longer available within 15 minutes of the site reopening at 08:00 BST. Appointments to visit a test site in England ran out about seven hours after the website opened on Sunday,much later than in the previous two days.Slots became available again at about 20:00 BST. Spaces remained available in Scotland throughout the day. Key workers in Wales and Northern Ireland cannot currently book tests online. Both nations appear as options on the government's online system but with a label saying no slots are available. The tests offered are swab tests that determine whether people currently have the virus - rather than whether they have had it in the past. One of those who sought a test was Kevin Melia, who works as an NHS theatre support worker at Chester Hospital and has been self-isolating at home because he thinks he has Covid-19 symptoms. He suffers from asthma and has a low immune system after having his leg amputated last year, he told the BBC. Mr Melia, who lives in Liverpool, said he tried to book an appointment on Sunday, but was told the nearest centre was in Birmingham. ""It's around 100 miles from where I live, this was at 8:30 this morning. I think this is just outrageous,"" he said. But Suzy Sard said for her, the process was ""very well organised"". She booked a slot at a centre in Portsmouth after her ex-husband displayed symptoms and she and her children were advised to self-isolate. ""I jumped at the chance to take a test so that I could get back to normality,"" the teaching assistant from Basingstoke said. ""When we arrived it was very well organised and all the staff there had personal protective equipment. ""The whole process took just over an hour. The staff were very polite and I was impressed with the service, considering how quickly it has been set up."" Doctors' leaders say all key workers should wear face masks The British Medical Association (BMA) has said testing for healthcare staff should not be allocated on a ""first come, first served"" basis. BMA chairman Dr Chaand Nagpaul said the new booking system ""offered no practical help"" to healthcare workers, adding that about 90,000 health and care staff are self-isolating. ""There is no point putting forward a proposal unless its matched with adequate capacity,"" he said. The BMA has also accused ministers of dragging their feet over calls for families of healthcare workers who lose their lives fighting coronavirus to be financially supported. Should the UK public be wearing face masks now? The government said it was currently considering the financial support for the families of those on the front line. More than 100 healthcare workers have died with the virus so far, according to BBC analysis. The BMA has also called for all key workers to be provided with face masks to combat the spread of the virus. How have you been affected by coronavirus? Are you a key worker trying to get a test?

"The government has requisitioned all stocks of masks French police say they have seized 140,000 face masks destined for sale on the black market. Officers say they caught a businessman unloading the masks from a lorry into a house in St Denis, north of Paris. Last month, France requisitioned all stocks and production of face masks to equip health workers. Meanwhile in China, the authorities have confiscated 89m poor quality face masks. The country has faced criticism over poor quality exports. Officials had inspected nearly 16 million businesses and had also seized large quantities of ineffective disinfectant, government official Gan Lin said. Should the UK public be wearing face masks now? Can you compare different countries? Why some countries wear face masks and others don't And in Germany, medical wholesalers say they have almost run out of masks. From Monday it will be compulsory for people to cover their faces in shops and on public transport in the country. The prices of masks online and in French shops had tripled before all stocks were requisitioned. The seized masks included 5,000 high specification (FFP2) masks for use with coronavirus patients. About a third were surgical masks. The suspects included a 60-year-old man, reportedly the seller who had bought the masks for â¬0.50 ($0.54; Â£0.44) each in the Netherlands. He was selling them for between â¬0.55-â¬0.60, Le Parisien newspaper reported. The seller appeared to have a list of clients including company bosses, the newspaper said. A second suspect was a 46-year-old who was allegedly about to buy some of the stock to sell on. There have been several seizures of masks in the Paris region since the pandemic began, including 29,000 masks found in Aubervilliers and 32,000 masks sezied in Saint-Ouen, both to the north of Paris. The country has seen 160,000 confirmed coronavirus cases and 22,600 deaths. France bans online sales of nicotine products Macron questions China's handling of coronavirus The huge seizure of masks there comes after several countries, including Spain, the Netherlands and Turkey, had to recall hundreds of thousands of items of poor-quality imported equipment. The Chinese authorities have set new quality standards for mask exports In the first two months of the year, almost 9,000 new manufacturers started producing masks in China, the business data platform Tianyancha reported. On Saturday China released new rules saying that exported protective gear had to meet international standards. The man trying to stop the virus (and fix China's image) The country's third-biggest supplier, Gehe of Stuttgart, said demand was outstripping supply despite stockpiling in anticipation of the new measures. Many German states have stressed that a scarf across the nose and mouth will be acceptable. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Health claims debunked Other countries including the UK have been reluctant to order people to cover their faces in public, partly for fear of draining supplies from hospitals. In the US, members of the public have been advised to use clean cloth or fabric to cover their faces whilst in public. Officials have stressed that medical masks are in short supply and should be left for healthcare workers. The Czech Republic also urged people to make their own cloth masks when it made it obligatory several weeks ago to wear one in public. Researchers say a non-medical mask may help protect others from an infected wearer, but will do little to ward off the virus. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

"Spanish children under the age of 14 are now allowed outside one hour per day Spain, which has been one of the countries worst hit in the coronavirus pandemic, has reported its lowest daily death toll in more than a month. Its health ministry said earlier that 288 more people had died of the virus, the lowest number since 20 March. The figure is a steep drop from the 378 deaths recorded on Saturday. On Sunday, children under the age of 14 were allowed to leave their homes for the first time in six weeks. They are now allowed outside for one hour a day. The health ministry said the total number of fatalities now stood at 23,190. Fernando Simon, director of the Spanish Health Alert and Emergency Co-ordination Centre, said: ""For the first time in a long time, we are below 300. ""Although it may be hard to give these statistics, it's a figure which indicates a clear, positive direction in the evolution of the epidemic."" The new lockdown conditions allow Spain's 6.3 million under-14s to leave their homes each day for a total of one hour between 09:00 and 21:00, but without going further than one kilometre (0.6 mile). Those over 13 are allowed to carry out errands for their parents, as has been the case throughout the lockdown. However, parents tend to prefer not to send their children out, especially to enclosed places such as supermarkets, where there is more risk of contagion. This video can not be played Children in Spain have been allowed outside for the first time in six weeks Bicycles, skates and skateboards are allowed, but public parks remain off-limits. The lockdown's other conditions remain in place for the moment and schools remain closed; the government is considering loosening the lockdown further in the second half of May. Psychologists have welcomed the lifting of restrictions for smaller children, saying that even one hour outside each day can provide an important boost to their state of mind. ""The change of routine, being outside and being in the sunlight - all of that is extremely important,"" says Laura PiÃ±eiro, a psychologist and the director in Madrid of the charity AsociaciÃ³n Bienestar Desarollo.

"Trade figures have issued new social distancing guidelines for shops to prepare for any easing of the lockdown. The British Retail Consortium and Usdaw's advice includes providing hand sanitiser for customers. Helen Dickinson, the BRC's boss, said: ""The safety and wellbeing of retail colleagues and customers remains the highest priority.""

"This video can not be played Watch: Tom Brady's top 10 moments One minute Tom Brady is being thrown out of a Tampa park, the next the city's mayor is cheerfully apologising and hinting the area could one day be renamed if the quarterback delivers. It would appear the 42-year-old's new home city is keen to ensure all parties get off on the right foot. No sooner had Brady joined the Tampa Bay Buccaneers than he wasasked to leave a park in the areaduring a workout because of the city's coronavirus shutdown. Still, if you've won the Super Bowl six times and are regarded as one of the greatest of all time (GOAT), people will go out of their way to make you feel at home. In a witty letter,,externalthe city's major Jane Castor wrote: ""Tom, my apologies for the miscommunication when you arrived - not the best first impression. ""But given my law enforcement background, I couldn't help but have someone investigate the sighting of a GOAT running wild in one of our beautiful city parks. No harm - no foul and thanks for being a good sport."" Brady ended a 20-year spell with the New England Patriotsto join Tampa Bay, who have also signed his former team-mate Rob Gronkowski for the 2020 season. Gronkowski, who has openly discussed his love of partying, was also addressed in the letter and politely warned: ""Just remember: 'No Shirt, No Shoes, No Service' is still in effect around here."" Tampa will host Super Bowl 55 on 7 February 2021, so Castor simply asked the pair: ""So let's gets serious, how can we help you guys win the Lombardi Trophy in Super Bowl 55? It is our aim to be the first team to win a Super Bowl in our own back yard. We dream big and set the bar high around here, more importantly, we get things done."" And Brady, it seems, now has new motivation. The four-time most valuable player in the Super Bowl hasreportedly sought to trademark the terms TOMPA BAY and TAMPA BRADY,externalin recent weeks. It appears, with success, the door may be open for change. After signing off her letter, mayor Castor wrote: ""PS - Tom, it's Tampa Bay. You win us a Super Bowl and we'll discuss Tampa Brady.""

"Furloughed workers may be encouraged to work as fruit and vegetable pickers to help farmers fill a labour shortage, the environment secretary has said. George Eustice told the daily Number 10 coronavirus briefing that only a third of the usual workforce was available. Many more would be needed in the summer and ""we are working with industry to identify an approach"" to get furloughed employees to help, he said. Much of the work would normally be done by seasonal migrant labourers. According to the British Growers Association, 70,000 seasonal staff a year are needed. However farmers say the pandemic has restricted the availability of foreign workers and have complained they cannot recruit enough domestic labour. Earlier this month special charter flights were arranged to fly in workers from Romania. Mr Eustice did not spell out how furloughed workers would be recruited. He said the international food chain is continuing to work well, but added the government was ""acutely aware"" that the British season for soft fruits and salads was about to begin. Mr Eustice estimated only about a third of the migrant labourers who normally work in the UK are in the country - and they arrived before lockdown. ""We are working with industry to identify an approach that will encourage those millions of furloughed workers in some cases to consider taking a second job, helping get the harvest in in June."" He added: ""It's not an issue at the moment since the harvest has barely begun, but we do anticipate that there will be a need to recruit staff for those sectors in the month of June."" Farm workers to be flown in from Eastern Europe Five ways coronavirus is disrupting the food industry Shops preparing ways to reopen amid coronavirus Shadow Environment Secretary Luke Pollard said the government needed to explain what support it could offer those working in the food supply sector, in particular farmers who are worried about their crops rotting in fields due to lack of agricultural labour. Furloughed staff have the right to seek work elsewhere during the shutdown as long as they have the permission of their main employer and are able to complete any training required of them while stood down. Guidance published on the government's website says those on furlough who take on new work must be ready to return to their normal job at any time and must complete the relevant paperwork making their situation clear to the tax authority Mr Eustice also told the briefing that food availability is improving, with both staffing levels in supermarkets and online delivery slots increasingly. Many food retail staff who had been self-isolating through suspected coronavirus have returned to work, he said. ""Absence levels are down from a peak of typically 20% in food businesses three weeks ago, to less than 10% at the end of last week, and, in some cases, individual companies reporting absences as low as 6%."" And UK supermarkets are adding an extra 300,000 delivery slots, following complaints, especially from vulnerable shoppers, that they were unable to book online slots. There were 2.1 million delivery slots at the beginning of the Covid-19 lockdown, a figure that increased to 2.6 million as demand soared. Mr Eustice confirmed it is now increasing to 2.9 million, although he admitted this may still not be enough to meet demand. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

For many people, the lockdown is about slowing down but Charli XCX has opted to keep herself busy by creating an entire album in just weeks. The singer plans to write and create an album with just the tools in her Los Angeles apartment. She's been getting fans involved by sharing demos on Instagram Live and posting ideas for lyrics to Twitter. The BBC's Mark Savage caught up with her via video chat to see how it's going.

Speaking in a video posted on Twitter, Jones says: ""Don't even think about breaking that two-metre rule."" ""Stay safe, stay out of my way and protect the NHS,"" Jones adds. More than two million people have watched the video so far and it has been shared by members of the cast including James Corden and Larry Lamb. Allow Twitter content?

The mayor of San Juan, the largest city in Puerto Rico, says not a single person on the US island territory has yet received their $1,200 stimulus cheque from the US federal government. Mayor Carmen YulÃ­n Cruz told MSNBC on Saturday: âNo-one in Puerto Rico has received their $1,200 coronavirus stimulus cheques from the federal government. Weâre having problems with a local $500 cheque that the governor said was going to be distributed.â She added that there was a backlog of around 130,000 unemployment applications. Earlier this week,the islandâs treasury secretary,externalsaid around 486,000 Puerto Ricans should expect to receive an email this weekend informing them that they are eligible to receive the federal bailout money. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo says the death rate has dropped in the state, with 367 deaths on Saturday compared with 437 on Friday. He said that transmission rates, as well as death rates, would dictate how and when the state reopens. Cuomo added that asking public to remain in their homes indefinitely with nothing to do through the summer would be impossible. âThereâs a sanity equation here,â he says, pointing to reports that domestic violence, drug and alcohol abuse and mental health problems have already increased. High street shops considering reopening have been given advice from trade bodies on social distancing. The British Retail Consortium as well as union Usdawhave suggested stores should provide hand-sanitiser and limit the number of people shopping at one time, among other arrangements. It comes after Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said earlier that ""careful steps"" would be needed to bring the country out of lockdown. The advice for non-food retailers is similar to measures which have been put in place by supermarkets and other essential shops, including floor markings to remind customers about 2m social distancing and scheduling deliveries at times to avoid crowding. The UK has seen more warm weather this weekend leading to fears the public would disregard lockdown rules. In the video below, police can be seen dispersing sunbathers at Primrose Hill in London. In the UK people are allowed to leave their homes for exercise once a day but sunbathing or picnics are not allowed. This video can not be played Police in North London tell sunbathers to leave park An Australian mobile phone app, which notifies people if they have been in close contact with another user who has tested positive for coronavirus, has been launched. The contact-tracing app - based on one introduced in Singapore - uses bluetooth to ""ping"" or exchange a ""digital handshake"" with another user when they come within 1.5 metres of each other. Prime Minister Scott Morrison has said social restrictions could be eased if enough people download the app. The app needs to be downloaded by 40% of the population to be effective, according to the government. But concerns have been raised about privacy and the storing of personal information. Health Minister Greg Hunt described safeguarding measures as ""the strongest ever"", insisting only state health authorities can access the information. The data will be deleted after 21 days. Norway is among the countries to have already launched a contact tracing app Italy has seen its lowest daily death toll since 14 March, with the Civil Protection Agency recording another 260 deaths. It brings the total number of fatalities to 26,644, second only to the USA. Today's figures marked the third successive daily fall in deaths and were sharply down from 415 yesterday. Reality Check Prof Stephen Powis, the national medical director for NHS England, has said there is a âhintâ of a small increase in people driving during the lockdown. The government statistics show that the use of transport has plummeted since the end of February. For instance, London bus usage has dropped by around 85%, while the use of the Tube and National Rail is down by 95%. However, motor vehicle usage has been creeping up slowly - in the first week of the lockdown this was down 64% but is now only down 59%. Similarly, visits to parks and grocery stores have also seen small upticks, according to the latest analysis from Google. However, the Google data also shows a significant further decline in visits to workplaces. Children in Spain have been enjoying the outdoors on Sunday after being allowed out of their homes for the first time in six weeks. Spain has relaxed lockdown rules to allow under-14s to leave their homes each day for a total of one hour between 9am and 9pm. They had been banned from leaving their homes completely from 14 March. Some restrictions remain, however, preventing the children visiting public parks or venturing more than 1km. David ShukmanScience editor, BBC News A new estimate that more than 100,000 people could die of Covid-19 in the UK later this year has made headlines. It comes from a modelling study by scientists at Imperial College London and it assesses the risk of one particular scenario. The researchers assessed what might happen if everyone was released from lockdown apart from the most vulnerable. Only the elderly and people with underlying health conditions would remain shielded. According to Prof Neil Ferguson from Imperial, inan interview with the UnHerd website,,externalthese people were most at risk and were also those who most need support, therefore needing to have some interactions with their carers. Even if there could be an 80% reduction in the infection risk for that group, his study suggests that would still mean more than 100,000 dying. Itâs worth pointing out that at the moment, the UK government is giving no indication of how or when any lockdown restrictions might be relaxed. And the study itself has yet to be released â that may happen in the coming days. Whatever its conclusions â and these will be hotly debated â the work provides another reminder of the threat from the virus and the extreme difficulty of judging how best to ease the measures to tackle it. Victoria GillScience reporter, BBC News The UK went into lockdown to prevent the NHS becoming overloaded Lockdown was an emergency stop - the only immediately available measure to put the brakes on a virus that outpaced our ability to contain it. And it has worked. The best estimates are that the rate of infection in the UK is now at a point where the number of new infections is decreasing. To keep it there, though, the next step has to be a very careful one. Prof Neil Ferguson, one of the governmentâs key scientific advisers, explained in a podcast called UnHerd how taking the brakes off too abruptly would drive that infection rate back up and cost thousands more lives. What he and other scientists will do now is create models of different scenarios as we enter a new lockdown phase. With the best data they have on this very new disease, they will calculate the impact - on that all-important infection rate - of reopening schools, of easing travel restrictions and of opening up certain types of businesses. The post-lockdown restrictions on our lives - and there will be many - will be guided by those careful calculations. But it will be down to the government to weigh the risks and the benefits and to tell us what the next phase in our ânew normalityâ will look like. Police in France say they have seized 140,000 face masks that were destined for sale on the black market. Officers say they discovered the haul when they spotted a businessman unloading the masks from a lorry into a house in St Denis, north of Paris. France requisitioned all stocks and production of face masks to equip health workers. There have been several seizures of masks in the Paris region since the pandemic began. Read more here. Reality Check As the UK government struggles to reach its target to carry out 100,000 coronavirus tests a day by the end of April, it has  started to emphasise the capacity to do tests. At today's news conference, Environment Secretary George Eustice said: âWe have been ramping up our capacity to do those tests - it currently stands at over 50,000 a day.â But the latest daily number of tests actually done is just 29,058 - a minuscule increase on the figure given yesterday. In a previous briefing, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said he was confident that the governmentâs coronavirus testing target of 100,000 by the end of the April âwill be met in terms of capacityâ. But when the target was first announced by the Health Secretary Matt Hancock on 2 April it was clearly intended to mean 100,000 tests actually being done a day. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent Prime Minister Boris Johnson could possibly lead the daily news conference on Monday but, if not then, it will be pretty soon afterwards. As far as I understand, he will be getting briefed by his Downing St team early tomorrow morning and then he will be chairing the Covid-19 meeting, which is a smaller group of cabinet ministers. That is what he used to do before he was off sick. Chairing Monday's meeting is a measure of him saying, ""Iâm back in charge"". From what I've been told, and the conversations Iâve had with people in Whitehall and Downing St, the prime minister will proceed with caution when it comes to dealing with the lockdown. We would expect an announcement on 7 May, when all this is being reviewed again, and I do think at that stage he will take his foot off the brake ever so slightly. But he will move cautiously because he will not want to fuel a second wave of infections. Although they haven't yet set a clear route map out of lockdown, not in the same way as the devolved administrations in Scotland and Wales, those discussions are most certainly going on behind the scenes. Talks involving the prime minister have taken place from his country residence Chequers with senior Cabinet ministers. Police in India have arrested three men who are accused of gang-raping a woman who had been unofficially quarantined. The woman, a low wage worker, was trying to walk more than 100km (62 miles) to her home in Jaipur, Rajasthan, when she got lost. Police spotted her and told her to spend the night in a deserted school building, away from other people just in case she had the virus. But she was gang-raped there after dark. Indiaâs lockdown was imposed last month leaving tens of thousands of people without jobs. Some have walked for days in desperation to reach their homes. Read more about the situation in India. With most of the world's sport currently on hold, many fans are wondering what their favourite competitions will look like when they are allowed to safely resume. Perhapsthese pictures from Nicaraguaprovide a clue. Authorities in the Central American country have allowed sporting events to continue during the coronavirus pandemic - but a boxing event held on Saturday looked very different. The boxers wore masks during the ring walk and at a pre-bout face off, although they were allowed to remove them in the ring. Referees, judges, the media, fans and ring girls also wore masks. Fans had to sit two seats apart and had their temperature checked before entering the arena in the capital Managua. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"The father of one of Scotland's largest families - Roy Hann - has tested positive for Covid-19 When lockdown measures were first announced, Roy and Emma Hann gave their children strict routines and organised family activities in a valiant effort to maintain order. The Hanns from Dundee areknown as one of Scotland's largest families- and with 10 of their 13 children living at home, their household was large enough to form two basketball teams. Despite the parents' best efforts, all order ""went out the window"" after the novelty wore off. Shattered nerves and bickering ensued as the family tried to cope with a less-than-peaceful new normal. But all tension subsided on Thursday when they learned Roy had tested positive for Covid-19. Roy in full PPE as he works with high acuity patients at Ninewells Hospital ""I'm a few days in and it's very mild,"" said Roy, a nurse practitioner at Ninewells Hospital. ""I was really surprised when I tested positive. ""I'm around so many Covid patients but I wear protective equipment and we're very proactive with testing in Tayside - so much so we're now listed as a hotspot. ""But we joke in work you're more likely to catch it from the supermarket - I just feel bad for being off."" The Hann household is now going through a 14-day quarantine - apart from Roy who will isolate for seven days. While the 50-year-old has type 2 diabetes, he says he generally keeps ""very well"" - he expects to return to full health and is keen to get back on the frontline of the pandemic. ""My life hadn't really changed, I just get to see my children more,"" he said. ""I'm actually glad I've had it, it makes me feel more confident about going back to work. ""There's so many in our house, we joke we're going for herd immunity."" Lockdown life - the Hanns have kept themselves entertained with family games With Roy in the house full-time, family life has become more manageable for cafÃ© owner Emma - but it's not without its challenges. The Hann children's ages range from five to 28 - at one stage the family got through 50 pints of milk, 21 loaves of bread and five large boxes of cereal each week. Now with social distancing at supermarkets and caps on products, buying food is more difficult than ever. ""The fact that we're a big family means social distancing guidelines are challenging for us,"" said Emma. ""To go to the shop and only buy three of an item means we need to go more often which exposes us more. To me it's quite a daunting situation."" Emma encouraged the youngest children to decorate a 'tuck shop' blackboard - which she now uses for 'bargaining' With work on hiatus, Emma's sole focus is looking after her children - her 28 years of experience has stood her in good stead, but the pressures of lockdown life have occasionally been overwhelming. She said: ""I went a walk the day before Roy tested positive and I started to hit a wall - I started crying. ""I thought I'm done and I just wanted a break because it was too hard. ""Weirdly the next morning when I told the family about Roy, they all took a bit of a moment - the last couple of days everyone has been pulling together a bit more."" Scotland's 'superfamily' set to welcome first grandchild With their sense of togetherness renewed, the Hanns continue to play basketball most nights in their garden. It's a simple pleasure - but one that has made all the difference. ""We feel very privileged,"" Emma said. ""We're very aware we have a garden. We've been in a situation where we had five kids in a flat and the idea of doing that now is terrible. ""I thought at the beginning of lockdown that structure would get me through it - but the reality is it doesn't work like that. ""My 14-year-old son is on his X-box for most of the night, while my daughter gets up at 6am to work from home - I didn't like it at first but it's actually easier to feed people in shifts.

An 80-year-old grandmother has drawn attention on social media afterwearing a pig mask to talk to a friend. The image of Marlene Conrad, from Alrewas in Staffordshire, was liked almost 75,000 times when it was shared on Twitter by her granddaughter, Liz. She wears the mask as she believes it offers some protection when she talks to best friend Maureen Madden, whose garden adjoins her own.

Chelsea Flower Showwill be held virtually for the first timeafter it was cancelled due to coronavirus. The famous event has taken place at London's Royal Hospital Chelsea every year since 1913, apart from gaps during World War One and World War Two.

The 2.6 Challenge,,externalwhich aims to raise money for charity during the lockdown, has begun today with people all around the country dreaming up creative activities to inspire donations and sponsorship. BBC Sport has looked at some of people's stories. Nine-year-old Noah Wilson from Durham used his dad Kirk as a punchbag in a bout of Thai boxing to raise money for charity. He usually trains most nights a week at the Unity Gym in Durham but because of lockdown he had to make do with his garden. He completed 26 rounds of boxing in memory of his baby cousin Phoebe who died in 2016 at 19 months from a rare condition.

Paulette Hamilton is the cabinet member for health and social care at Birmingham City Council People from South Asian backgrounds are being hit harder by coronavirus than other communities in the West Midlands, she said. Some research suggests the BAME community may be more at risk due to anincreased risk of certain health conditions such as diabetes and heart disease.  A man has run a marathon in his back garden, dressed as a rhinoceros. Andy Humphries from Blagdon in Somerset had been due to run the London Marathon in a rhino suit, in aid of Save The Rhino. Because the race was postponed because of coronavirus, he instead ran the 26.2 miles at home, and partly by running into his local village and back. He took about 6 hours 30 minutes to finish.  A councillor has spoken of his disbelief after
campers in a convoy of vans descended on a valley in Northumberland. Steven Bridgett, who represents Rothbury in
Northumberland, said a local resident spotted the campers setting out
deck chairs in Upper Coquetdale, and took this long-range snap. The independent council said Northumbria
Police officers were alerted and the visitors were moved on. Mr Bridgett said: âItâs unbelievable our
hills have literally been alive with droves of tourists with no respect for
lockdown.""  With nightclubs closed, DJ sets have moved online while revellers party at home and interact in web chat rooms. Butwhat do they get out of it? Club owner Deltic said up to 350,000 people streamed sets on its Facebook pages while an Easter fundraiser attracted an estimated 1.5 million views. ""People want the community vibe,"" he said.

Drones will be used tocarry medical supplies from Hampshire to the Isle of Wight,the government has announced.

After he was discharged on 12 April, Mr Johnson suggested his condition ""could have gone either way"" and praised the staff at St Thomas Hospital in central London who looked after him. Oxford University's Prof Christophe Fraser told the BBC's Andrew Marr between three and 10% of the population was predicted to have contracted coronavirus by this stage - up to six million people. Prof Fraser is working on developing an app which would allow for tracing people who had been in touch with those with Covid-19. Prof Fraser said the app helps deal with the problem of 50% of transmissions taking place from people who are infected but not yet showing symptoms. He said with the software, people could be alerted if they had come into contact with a person with symptoms, in which case they should observe stronger social-distancing, or a confirmed case which would mean going into isolation.

"Managers at Harbour House Care Home say testing staff is one of their ""biggest challenges"" Care homes looking after thousands of vulnerable residents have said none of their staff has been tested for coronavirus. Out of 210 care providers spoken to by the BBC, 159 said none of their workers had had a test. Some have told how staff face long journeys to test centres, with one reporting a three-hour round trip. The government said all symptomatic staff, residents and their families would be tested. On Sunday it was announced thatthe military will begin testing essential workers in mobile unitsoperating at sites in ""hard to reach"" areas, including care homes. Eight of the new mobile units are already stationed at locations across the country, including Salisbury, Southport and Teesside, with plans to extend the scheme to at least 96 units by the start of May. BBC England spoke to care homes and companies across the country, who between them employ nearly 18,000 staff and have almost 13,000 residents. Many said they had seen no testing at all, while others have spoken of struggles to access official test centres after reporting online that they have symptoms. Anna Knight runs Harbour House Care Home on the Dorset coast and said getting enough personal protective equipment (PPE) and testing for coronavirus were her biggest challenges. ""I know that our PPE supplies are running low. I know that I have got anxious staff, and I am relying on donations from the public,"" she said. Staff at Harbour House say stocks of personal protective equipment are also running low The home has 35 residents, aged 83 and older. They are isolating one resident, but have been told they would need at least two suspected cases for any tests to be carried out. The home's closest official test centre is in Plymouth - meaning a three-hour round trip for staff to get tests. In total, 23 care homes spread across England - including some in Oxfordshire, Bristol, Teesside and Yorkshire - said far away drive-through test centres were a problem, leaving staff who do not have cars unable to access them. The BBC also asked care homes and providers about tests for residents, with 127 out of 205 saying none of their residents had been tested for the virus. At homes that had seen tests carried out, 334 of 7,391 residents had been tested. Already the signs are that the number of deaths in care homes from coronavirus is going to be distressingly high. That's despite many homes going into lockdown early, with even relatives prevented from visiting. Some care providers believe the extremely limited testing of staff, residents and anyone arriving at or returning to a home from hospital, has made it too easy for the virus to find a way in. This week Dr Hans Kluge, regional director of the World Health Organization (WHO) in Europe, said we need to understand the ""pathways to infection"" that have allowed a ""deeply disturbing picture"" to emerge in care homes. He concluded that the pandemic had shone a spotlight on the ""overlooked and undervalued corners of society"". Words that will strike a chord with those who argue support, like more testing, was needed much earlier to protect this vulnerable group of people. There were 975 deaths in care homes in England of people with Covid-19 up to 10 April, according to the Office for National Statistics. Separate research by the National Care Forum found care workers were travelling an average 62-mile round trip to test centres. Executive director Vic Rayner said: ""A large proportion of care staff rely on public transport to get about. ""More needs to be done and practical arrangements made to enable care workers to have access to testing centres so that they can have the confidence and reassurance they need in supporting the most vulnerable in our country.""

"The military has started testing essential workers in the UK for coronavirus in mobile units operating in ""hard to reach"" areas. At least 96 new pop-up facilities, which will travel to care homes, police and fire stations, prisons and benefits centres, are planned in total. Eleven of those mobile sites are up-and-running in areas including Salisbury, Carlisle and Watford. It comes as the government aims to reach 100,000 tests a day by Thursday. The latest figures released by the government reveal a running total of 20,732 deaths of people with coronavirus, not including those in English care homes, which are collated separately. The 'good outcome' that never was UK hospital coronavirus deaths pass 20,000 How close is the UK to 100,000 tests a day? Are you a key worker trying to get a test? Email:haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external There were 29,058 tests carried out on Saturday, an increase from the 28,760 tests carried out the day before, but still far short of the government's daily target of 100,000 - which it aims to achieve by the end of April. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show the government has to ""ramp testing right up"" but added it was ""on track"" to hit its target. ""We have certainly got to get the daily testing right up to hundreds of thousands which, along with the tracking and tracing, gives usâ¦ more flexibility because we can open up measures, open up access,"" Mr Raab said. ""That, along with the vaccine and therapeutics will be the medium to long-term way of dealing with coronavirus sustainably and responsibly for good."" Drive-through testing facilities have been set up around the country Some health and care workers have previously reportedhaving to make long journeys to their nearest drive-through testing centres. Many care homes have said none of their staff have been tested, while others have spoken of struggles to access official test centres after reporting online they have symptoms. Of 210 care providers contacted by the BBC earlier this week, 159 said none of their workers had been tested. Environment Secretary George Eustice said at the daily government press briefing that the capacity for testing has risen to more than 50,000 a day, adding that ""significant numbers"" of people in care homes are obtaining tests. The new pop-up facilities, which can be set up in 20 minutes, see swabs collected by ""specially trained"" military personnel and taken to one of three ""mega labs"" to be processed, with results expected within 48 hours. The number of units is being scaled up after a successful pilot last week. An extra 80 or so units, expected to be running by the start of May, will travel to areas where there was ""significant demand"", the government said. The armed forces will staff 92 of the units, while civilian contractors will operate a further four located in Northern Ireland, the DHSC said. And mobile units set up by the military to carry out tests at care homes will be in operation in Scotland by next week, the Scottish health secretary has said. Jeane Freeman told the BBC's Sunday Politics Scotland: ""We anticipate in the coming week we will have five of those and that is to be followed by a further eight."" The UK has come a long way on testing. When the first cases of coronavirus emerged, the government was reliant on eight Public Health England labs, which could carry out little more than 1,000 tests a day. That then expanded to include hospital labs, before a network of drive-through testing centres was created - there are around 30, but they will increase to nearly 50 soon - supported by three mega-labs for processing tests. The aim is to get to the target of 100,000 tests a day by the end of the month. But as the range of people entitled to testing has increased, one of the issues has been ensuring it is available close to where people need it. A drive-through centre 30 miles from a care worker who does not have access to a car is of little use for example. The pop-up testing centres run by the military, which are also coinciding with the development of home testing kits, are an attempt to remedy that and ensure the full testing capacity is used. Currently only around half the 50,000 available tests on any given day are being carried out. Prof John Newton, who is co-ordinating coronavirus testing for the government, said the new mobile testing units would help achieve the goal of performing 100,000 tests a day by ""providing tests to vital frontline workers wherever they need them"". He said efforts to increase capacity had resulted in ""scores of new testing facilities and Britain's largest network of diagnostic labs in history"". Since Friday, millions of key workers and people they live with have been able to book appointments online to be tested. Those too ill to travel should also be able to order home kits - although numbers are limited. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash STRESS:How to look after your mental health On Sunday morning home kits were no longer available within 15 minutes of the site reopening at 08:00 BST. Appointments to visit a test site in England ran out about seven hours after the website opened on Sunday,much later than in the previous two days.Slots became available again at about 20:00 BST. Spaces remained available in Scotland throughout the day. Key workers in Wales and Northern Ireland cannot currently book tests online. Both nations appear as options on the government's online system but with a label saying no slots are available. The tests offered are swab tests that determine whether people currently have the virus - rather than whether they have had it in the past. One of those who sought a test was Kevin Melia, who works as an NHS theatre support worker at Chester Hospital and has been self-isolating at home because he thinks he has Covid-19 symptoms. He suffers from asthma and has a low immune system after having his leg amputated last year, he told the BBC. Mr Melia, who lives in Liverpool, said he tried to book an appointment on Sunday, but was told the nearest centre was in Birmingham. ""It's around 100 miles from where I live, this was at 8:30 this morning. I think this is just outrageous,"" he said. But Suzy Sard said for her, the process was ""very well organised"". She booked a slot at a centre in Portsmouth after her ex-husband displayed symptoms and she and her children were advised to self-isolate. ""I jumped at the chance to take a test so that I could get back to normality,"" the teaching assistant from Basingstoke said. ""When we arrived it was very well organised and all the staff there had personal protective equipment. ""The whole process took just over an hour. The staff were very polite and I was impressed with the service, considering how quickly it has been set up."" Doctors' leaders say all key workers should wear face masks The British Medical Association (BMA) has said testing for healthcare staff should not be allocated on a ""first come, first served"" basis. BMA chairman Dr Chaand Nagpaul said the new booking system ""offered no practical help"" to healthcare workers, adding that about 90,000 health and care staff are self-isolating. ""There is no point putting forward a proposal unless its matched with adequate capacity,"" he said. The BMA has also accused ministers of dragging their feet over calls for families of healthcare workers who lose their lives fighting coronavirus to be financially supported. Should the UK public be wearing face masks now? The government said it was currently considering the financial support for the families of those on the front line. More than 100 healthcare workers have died with the virus so far, according to BBC analysis. The BMA has also called for all key workers to be provided with face masks to combat the spread of the virus. How have you been affected by coronavirus? Are you a key worker trying to get a test?

"This video can not be played Dominic Raab: NHS staff 'have best PPE we can get them' The UK's lockdown needs to be eased carefully, meaning social distancing will remain for ""some time"", Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has said. He described the more than 20,000 deaths in the UK as ""heartbreaking"", but said the toll could have been ""much worse"" without the strict measures. However, Mr Raab did hint at some ways schools, sport and businesses could begin to return to ""a new normal"". Meanwhile, the PM has arrived back in Downing Street to resume work. Prime Minister Boris Johnson will chair the morning meeting of the government's coronavirus ""war cabinet"" on Monday, after recovering from Covid-19. It is almost a month since he was diagnosed with the virus. A further 413 people have died with coronavirus in UK hospitals - the lowest number that has been reported in April. However,experts have previously warned againstover-interpreting daily statistics, as they often reflect reporting delays, particularly over weekends - so do not relate directly to the number of deaths that occurred on a certain day. Wales virus death toll rises to 788 Scotland's lockdown exit could differ from UK Are the five tests for ending lockdown being met? Does hospital deaths milestone mean failure for UK? The latest official figures bring the total number of deaths to 20,732. The government's data does not include people who die in care homes, in their own homes, or elsewhere in the community. The government has come under pressure from Labour to set out its ""exit strategy"" for lifting the lockdown. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? Shadow cabinet office minister Rachel Reeves said ministers should treat people ""like grown-ups"" and should publish their plans for exiting the lockdown - to give businesses, schools and other organisations time to prepare. But Mr Raab, who has been deputising for Boris Johnson while the PM recovers from coronavirus, said it would not be responsible to start announcing specific proposals until evidence was available to support them as this could risk ""misleading"" the public. PM's return to work 'a boost for the country' How do you social distance in schools? Rather than a complete lifting of all measures, he told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show that the country would end up ""moving to a new normal"". Mr Raab said when schools reopened, social distancing measures would need to be in place for pupils and staff. ""I think it's inconceivable that they would come back without further measures, as are already being applied in those schools that are open for key workers,"" he said. But he would not be drawn on a suggestion that this would mean groups of pupils returning to lessons on different days or times to keep pupil numbers down. The death toll rising further above 20,000 is a sobering reality and brings more devastating news for bereaved families. However, the increase of 413 in daily reported deaths was the lowest since late March. There are the usual caveats about weekend reporting of figures and there is likely to be another move up during the week when more data comes in. But, in combination with other statistics today, it all added up to a slightly more positive picture being portrayed at the Downing Street media briefing. New infections are not increasing even though the number of people tested is rising. The total number of patients with Covid-19 in hospitals is falling in most parts of the UK. NHS leaders are talking of coming ""through the peak"". But they don't expect a steady downwards trajectory, more a slowly declining plateau. As Professor James Naismith of Oxford University put it, ""the virus takes us in an express elevator to the top of the peak but we have to find our way back down by the stairs"". Mr Raab suggested social distancing measures already being seen in food shops and other businesses that have remained operating could also be expanded to non-essential businesses if they were to reopen. Asked whether there was any chance of people being able to play sport outside this summer, Mr Raab  saidthis would be ""difficult""due to the ""level and scale of interaction"". But he added: ""I think the professional sport may be different because of the scale of testing that they would be able to introduce."" On the possibility of testing people arriving at UK airports, Mr Raab said this measure might be introduced but he ""can't say it with any certainty yet"". ""The advice that we got - and I checked it with the scientists, with the chief medical officer - at the outset when we took up our social distancing measures, is that it wouldn't make any difference from a public health point of view,"" he said. At that time, the number of people travelling was ""plummeting"" and ""the virus was already at pace"" within the UK, he added. But he said that might need to be reviewed when the number of people with the virus in the UK had dropped significantly. ""Whether it's a quarantine period, or testing, or other measures that might be taken, it's possible - and I ask this question every weekâ¦ and we will keep asking that question."" Supermarkets have remained open with social distancing measures At Sunday's Downing Street briefing, NHS England's Medical Director, Prof Stephen Powis, said efforts by the public to follow social distancing guidelines ""have begun to pay off"", but stressed this would only continue if people continue to comply with the strict measures. He said there was a ""very definite"" trend of a reduced number of people in hospitals - most markedly in London - and said there had been a decline in the number of critical care beds used for Covid-19 patients. But Prof Powis insisted it was too early to ease off lockdown measures. This video can not be played Rachel Reeves: ""Businesses, schools and other organisations need time to plan if they are to reopen"" In his opening remarks at the government briefing, Environment Secretary George Eustice said food availability in UK supermarkets had returned to ""normal levels"" after a period of panic-buying at the start of the coronavirus outbreak. Mr Eustice said the international food chain is continuing to ""work well"", but he said he expected there would be a needto recruit furloughed staffto harvest crops at the start of the summer. He also dismissed reports that travellers returning to the UK will have to be quarantined as ""speculation"", saying ""no decisions"" have yet been taken on measures beyond lockdown. Meanwhile, First Minister Nicola Sturgeonwarned she could delay any lifting of the restrictions in Scotlandif she thought the government at Westminster was moving too quickly. ""If... the UK government took decisions that I thought were premature in terms of coming out of the lockdown then clearly I would want to make sure that Scotland did what I judged was best to protect the population,"" she told the programme.

"Coronavirus tests offered to UK key workers were booked up within an hour - apart from some in Scotland. The tests, which are targeted at those who are self-isolating, allow people to return to work as quickly as possible. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said testing is part of ""getting Britain back on her feet"". But the government website closed to new applicants within hours of the Friday launch, after 46,000 people tried to access it. Home testing kits became unavailable less than 15 minutes after bookings reopened on Saturday morning. Some 16,000 bookings were made. Tests at drive-through sites in England were booked up within an hour on Saturday morning, with spaces not becoming available again until the evening. Requests for drive-through tests in Scotland are still currently available on the site. Key workers inWales,externalandNorthern Ireland,externalcannot currently book tests online. Both nations appear as options on the government's online system but with a label saying no slots are available. For key workers in England and Scotland with symptoms of the virus, and anyone in their household with symptoms, tests at drive-through centres and home testing kits will become available each day from 08:00 BST, Downing Street has said. Testing extended to include key workers in Scotland Essential workers can also request a test through their employers. The tests offered are swab tests that determine whether people currently have the virus - rather than whether they have had it in the past. Applications to the UK government website was initially open only to people in England,but tests became available to people in Scotland on Saturday. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash STRESS:How to look after your mental health Dr Simon Eccles, chief clinical information officer at NHS Digital, said an ""amazing team"" had worked ""all night"" to enable the site to reopen on Saturday. After home testing kits were booked up,he wrote on Twitter,external: ""I know it's frustrating but we're developing more lab, supply and logistics capacity every day. ""If we'd waited until we had the full 100k, to launch, no-one would have had a test today."" How close is the UK to 100,000 tests a day? Prof Stephen Powis, medical director of NHS England, urged key workers showing Covid-19 symptoms to book a test online. He told BBC Breakfast there was now capacity for more than 50,000 daily tests - and that reaching 100,000 a day by Thursday remained ""the aim"". ""The NHS has committed to capacity of 25,000 within NHS laboratories and we are on trajectory for that capacity to be in place,"" he said. Natalie Orton-Rose, from Leicester, said she managed to book a test on Friday but was turned away after she arrived at the drive-through centre. The property manager for Poundstretcher, who is classed as a key worker, said she has been self-isolating after being told by her doctor that it was likely she had Covid-19. Natalie, 34, said she requested a test at 07:00 BST on Friday and ""finally"" got a code to book an appointment at 15:00. ""I drove an hour from my home in Leicester [to the test centre in Nottingham] and sat waiting for half an hour in the queue only to be told actually they had no more tests left,"" she said. ""I am absolutely disgusted. It is bad enough that my closest test centre is an hour away but then to waste my time and fuel... I think the government and public need to be aware that just because you have an appointment and turn up doesn't mean you'll get the very much needed test."" Anyoneclassified as an ""essential worker"",externalwho is showing symptoms can request a test in England. The list includes NHS and social care staff, teachers, police officers and transport workers. They and their family can also request a test if someone in their household shows symptoms. If a child in the same household as an essential worker needs a test, the child's parent or guardian must book it on their behalf. The test involves taking a swab of the nose and the back of the throat. There are two ways to get a test: at a testing site, or with a home testing kit. Home kits will initially be limited but are being sent to NHS staff. Most people will get their test results by text within two days. Provided you and/or those in your household have not tested positive, you can go back to work. That is so long as you are well enough and have not had a high temperature for 48 hours. Of course, you can only go to work if you are defined as a key worker - or you work in a job that is notamong those that has been ordered to stop by the government,external, and you cannot work from home.

"The father of one of Scotland's largest families - Roy Hann - has tested positive for Covid-19 When lockdown measures were first announced, Roy and Emma Hann gave their children strict routines and organised family activities in a valiant effort to maintain order. The Hanns from Dundee areknown as one of Scotland's largest families- and with 10 of their 13 children living at home, their household was large enough to form two basketball teams. Despite the parents' best efforts, all order ""went out the window"" after the novelty wore off. Shattered nerves and bickering ensued as the family tried to cope with a less-than-peaceful new normal. But all tension subsided on Thursday when they learned Roy had tested positive for Covid-19. Roy in full PPE as he works with high acuity patients at Ninewells Hospital ""I'm a few days in and it's very mild,"" said Roy, a nurse practitioner at Ninewells Hospital. ""I was really surprised when I tested positive. ""I'm around so many Covid patients but I wear protective equipment and we're very proactive with testing in Tayside - so much so we're now listed as a hotspot. ""But we joke in work you're more likely to catch it from the supermarket - I just feel bad for being off."" The Hann household is now going through a 14-day quarantine - apart from Roy who will isolate for seven days. While the 50-year-old has type 2 diabetes, he says he generally keeps ""very well"" - he expects to return to full health and is keen to get back on the frontline of the pandemic. ""My life hadn't really changed, I just get to see my children more,"" he said. ""I'm actually glad I've had it, it makes me feel more confident about going back to work. ""There's so many in our house, we joke we're going for herd immunity."" Lockdown life - the Hanns have kept themselves entertained with family games With Roy in the house full-time, family life has become more manageable for cafÃ© owner Emma - but it's not without its challenges. The Hann children's ages range from five to 28 - at one stage the family got through 50 pints of milk, 21 loaves of bread and five large boxes of cereal each week. Now with social distancing at supermarkets and caps on products, buying food is more difficult than ever. ""The fact that we're a big family means social distancing guidelines are challenging for us,"" said Emma. ""To go to the shop and only buy three of an item means we need to go more often which exposes us more. To me it's quite a daunting situation."" Emma encouraged the youngest children to decorate a 'tuck shop' blackboard - which she now uses for 'bargaining' With work on hiatus, Emma's sole focus is looking after her children - her 28 years of experience has stood her in good stead, but the pressures of lockdown life have occasionally been overwhelming. She said: ""I went a walk the day before Roy tested positive and I started to hit a wall - I started crying. ""I thought I'm done and I just wanted a break because it was too hard. ""Weirdly the next morning when I told the family about Roy, they all took a bit of a moment - the last couple of days everyone has been pulling together a bit more."" Scotland's 'superfamily' set to welcome first grandchild With their sense of togetherness renewed, the Hanns continue to play basketball most nights in their garden. It's a simple pleasure - but one that has made all the difference. ""We feel very privileged,"" Emma said. ""We're very aware we have a garden. We've been in a situation where we had five kids in a flat and the idea of doing that now is terrible. ""I thought at the beginning of lockdown that structure would get me through it - but the reality is it doesn't work like that. ""My 14-year-old son is on his X-box for most of the night, while my daughter gets up at 6am to work from home - I didn't like it at first but it's actually easier to feed people in shifts.

"This video can not be played Dominic Raab: NHS staff 'have best PPE we can get them' The UK's lockdown needs to be eased carefully, meaning social distancing will remain for ""some time"", Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has said. He described the more than 20,000 deaths in the UK as ""heartbreaking"", but said the toll could have been ""much worse"" without the strict measures. However, Mr Raab did hint at some ways schools, sport and businesses could begin to return to ""a new normal"". Meanwhile, the PM has arrived back in Downing Street to resume work. Prime Minister Boris Johnson will chair the morning meeting of the government's coronavirus ""war cabinet"" on Monday, after recovering from Covid-19. It is almost a month since he was diagnosed with the virus. A further 413 people have died with coronavirus in UK hospitals - the lowest number that has been reported in April. However,experts have previously warned againstover-interpreting daily statistics, as they often reflect reporting delays, particularly over weekends - so do not relate directly to the number of deaths that occurred on a certain day. Wales virus death toll rises to 788 Scotland's lockdown exit could differ from UK Are the five tests for ending lockdown being met? Does hospital deaths milestone mean failure for UK? The latest official figures bring the total number of deaths to 20,732. The government's data does not include people who die in care homes, in their own homes, or elsewhere in the community.

Shadow cabinet office minister Rachel Reeves said ministers should treat people ""like grown-ups"" and should publish their plans for exiting the lockdown - to give businesses, schools and other organisations time to prepare. But Mr Raab, who has been deputising for Boris Johnson while the PM recovers from coronavirus, said it would not be responsible to start announcing specific proposals until evidence was available to support them as this could risk ""misleading"" the public. PM's return to work 'a boost for the country' How do you social distance in schools? Rather than a complete lifting of all measures, he told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show that the country would end up ""moving to a new normal"". Mr Raab said when schools reopened, social distancing measures would need to be in place for pupils and staff. ""I think it's inconceivable that they would come back without further measures, as are already being applied in those schools that are open for key workers,"" he said. But he would not be drawn on a suggestion that this would mean groups of pupils returning to lessons on different days or times to keep pupil numbers down.

"Five military-staffed mobile testing units will be opened in Scotland next week, with a further eight soon after that First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says she is prepared to take different path to rest of UK over lockdown but will not do anything different ""for the sake of it"" More than 22,000 former staff and students have volunteered to join or rejoin the health or social care services Latest Scottish government figures show 1,249 people have died after testing positive for Covid-19 - an increase of 18 on Saturday Suspected cases of Covid-19 in Scotland's care homes have increased by 69 to 2,690 Recorded crime in Scotland has fallen by about 25% during the coronavirus lockdown, say police BBC Scotland News As we bring our live coverage of today's coronavirus developments in Scotland to a close, here is a reminder of Sunday's main headlines.  Join us tomorrow for more live updates. Rangers say they will produce ""our evidence at the appropriate time"" after calling for an independent inquiry into the Scottish Professional Football League's handling of an early end to the season. Hearts, who also want a general meeting of all clubs to consider the circumstances, and Ross County today called on the Ibrox club to reveal details they say came from a ""whistleblower"". An investigation by auditor Deloitte concluded there was ""no evidence of impropriety"" in the vote that led to the Championship, League One and League Two being ended early, with the Premiership likely to follow. But Rangers say: ""It is vital
that those involved in making those decisions have the confidence and support
of member clubs. An independent investigation provides a route to achieving
this. ""The
evidence will be provided to all member clubs well in advance of a general
meeting to approve an independent investigation."" The Scottish government should reveal how much money councils are receiving to help fight the impact of Covid-19, according to Scottish Conservatives. It has received around Â£155m from the UK government to help local authorities, with Tory leader Jackson Carlaw saying there is ""increasing public appetite for full transparency when it comes to the allocation of funds"". ""We're still waiting for the SNP to publish in detail how it has passed on money for economic support,"" he said. ""Workers and residents in care homes won't accept similar delays for this fund."" Finance secretary Kate Forbes pointed out the Scottish government had already ""committed direct additional funding to local authorities of Â£175.6m - including a Â£50m hardship fund, Â£45m to the Scottish Welfare Fund, Â£15m each for Free School Meals and the Food Fund and a Â£50m boost for the Council Tax Reduction Scheme and Social Security.""

Boris Johnson and Nicola Sturgeon, pictured together last year, have both come under fire for missing Cobra meetings Nicola Sturgeon missing five Cobra meetings has been declared a ""dereliction of duty"" by Scottish Labour deputy leader Jackie Ballie. Scottish Health Secretary Jeane Freeman today admitted that she had attended early Covid-19 meetings, also missed by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, instead. ""The first minister needs to explain what she was doing that was so important that she missed all these meetings, or is this merely about status and she won't go if Boris isn't there?"" Ms Ballie said. ""As questions continue about the seeming lack of preparedness for the coronavirus pandemic, the insufficient supply of PPE and the lack of testing, not attending the Cobra meeting seems like poor judgement on the part of the first minister."" Ms Freeman earlier explained that those early Cobra meetings had been chaired by UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock because the pandemic was being viewed from ""a health perspective"", with Ms Sturgeon and Mr Johnson joining once it became an issue for wider society. The Scottish government is considering if it is feasible for children to carry out physical distancing in schools once the lockdown is over. So how could this work? Options include:  Read more here. Environment Secretary George Eustice was asked if when the prime minister is back at work on Monday, he will follow the first ministers of Scotland and Wales in publishing a lockdown exit plan. But Mr Eustice says it is ""too early"" to review social distancing, saying the evidence will be examined at the regular three-week review, with the next one scheduled for 7 May. Prof Powis, national medical director of NHS England, says it is ""a continually evolving approach based on emerging science"". Catch up on the rest of theUK government's briefing here.

People have been coming forward to join and rejoin health and care services to help battle coronavirus. Tom Gordon from The Herald points out that, when it emerged a week ago that Boris Johnson had missed five meetings of the emergency Cobra committee in January and February, SNP MP Ian Blackford accused the UK government of ""jaw dropping negligence and complacency"". He wonders if the same applies to Nicola Sturgeon as the first minister ""missed those same meetings"". Scottish Health Secretary Jeane Freeman points out that, as the Covid-19 crisis was being looked at ""from a health perspective"" in the early stages, she had personally attended all Cobra meetings, chaired by Secretary of State for Health Matt Hancock, from the very beginning, apart from one. The first minister had taken part from 2 March as ""wider decisions"" were being taken that affected society as a whole. However, Ms Freeman stresses that the Scottish government had set up its own ""resilience operation"" as far back as late January to plan for the pandemic, and this had been chaired by the first minister. Paris Gourtsoyannis from the Scotsman asks the Scottish health secretary about recent remarks from SNP MP Stewart Hosie criticising the UK government's response to the coronavirus outbreak. Jeane Freeman is asked if the Scottish government supports calls for a public inquiry into the UK government's approach. Ms Freeman said: ""I think we have been clear on a number of occasions at this briefing that I fully expect there to be a proper, serious look - maybe in an inquiry. ""If it is, we will of course take part in that freely and openly about how the governments of the UK have responded to this pandemic."" Environment Secretary George Eustice is leading the UK government's daily briefing from Downing Street today. He opens by reporting the latest coronavirus figures in the UK, with 413 additional deaths in hospital bringing the total to 20,732. Mr Eustice is joined by Prof Stephen Powis, national medical director of NHS England. You canfollow the briefing here. Louise Scott from STV asks about the uptake of testing for care
home workers and what can be done to prevent the spread of coronavirus within such facilities. Jeane Freeman says the most recent figures from National Records of Scotland showed that athird of all suspected Covid-19 deaths in Scotlandwere in care homes. Of all key workers being tested, the figures suggest
that 21% have been social care workers. The health secretary says additional guidance has been issued to care home providers so they understand how their staff can be tested, while she reiterates that all new admissions to care homes are now tested. Chris Musson from The Sun asks Jeane Freeman how long a shipment of PPE from China held at Prestwick Airport due to a labelling mistake will be kept there. Ms Freeman says the ""really important"" shipment contains 10 million fluid resistant masks (with a further 1 million for NHS Wales) and 20,000 testing kits. She said work was under way to resolve the labelling issue, which she expected to be completed this week, at which point the cargo will be distributed. Ms Freeman said: âWhat we knew was that it was possible the fact that the
shipment didnât have a label on all the boxes, but had a note inside the boxes, may not be sufficient to clear them out of the airport and get them where we
need them to be. ""But we took the view that it was better to have that aircraft
with that important cargo sitting on a runway at an airport in Scotland than
sitting on the runway in China."" Suzanne Allan, from BBC Scotland, asks if the Scottish government accepts, ""as some experts have said"", that it was too quick to abandon mass testing and contact tracing and too slow to increase testing now, pointing out that other countries, like Germany and South Korea, used 'test, trace, isolate' effectively from early on. Jeane Freeman points out that testing is used in different ways at different stages of a pandemic and that the government was guided by ""the best expert scientific and clinical advice available"". ""In the early days of that four-nation plan, test and trace was important, but as the virus became more prevalent in the community, it made sense at that point to move into delay of the virus - the purpose of testing changed,"" she says. Ms Freeman stresses that the Scottish government is planning for a greater use of 'test, trace and isolate' when moving out of the lockdown. The Scottish public has been warned not to flout the social distancing regulations or risk the lockdown being extended further. National clinical director Jason Leitch says the behaviour of individuals ""matters for me, your neighbours and the wider Scottish population"". ""Please don't look for ways to push the boundaries of the guidelines,"" he says. ""Don't ask questions of what you might be able to do. Instead, find ways to fit inside the boundaries and regulations - and stay at home. ""The more you do that, the sooner we will be able to advise the decision makers that the boundaries should fall. One thing's for sure, if the numbers do not fall, the advice will stay the same."" Scotland's national clinical director pays tribute to what he calls the ""unsung heroes"" of the NHS and care services - the managers who ""don't wear scrubs and don't wear uniforms"". ""You cannot treble Scotland's intensive care capacity without managers, you cannot reduce Scotland's delayed discharges by more than 1,000 without managers, you cannot build and kit out the Louise Jordan Hospital without managers,"" says Prof Jason Leitch. He adds that they have been ""working day and night"" to make sure their staff respond to the Covid-19 crisis. Fiona
McQueen, Scotland's chief nursing officer, says she  is âincredibly gratefulâ to all the core NHS staff
who are âworking tirelessly across the country seven days a week, 24 hours a
dayâ. ""The people of Scotland are indebted to you,â she notes. Ms McQueen says it is ""incredibly important"" that services for people in care
homes are enhanced with ""additional staff"" and ""additional cleaning"". She appeals directly to nurses who are returning, or working in
areas where services have been scaled back, to ""rally round"" community nurses and those who are looking after people in the shielded category. Ms McQueen says she has urged nurse directors and boards to make sure
the deployment of staff is principally where it is needed. Jeane Freeman appeals to those who have been asked to completely self-isolate because they are at highest risk from Covid-19 to stick with the lockdown restrictions despite it being ""a worrying time"". ""Staying at home is necessary for your own protection,"" the Scottish health secretary tells this ""shielding"" group..""But I know that it is even harder than the restrictions that are in place for everyone else. ""We are determined to ensure that support is available to you throughout this period. Please make use of support that is available to you."" Ms Freeman pointed out that if members of the public could not access help via the internet, they can contact their local councils. More than 80,000 free deliveries of food packages have been made so far More than 78,000 of the 160,000 people in Scotland who are considered to be at the highest clinical risk for Covid-19 have now registered with the Scottish government to ask for support, reports Jeane Freeman. The health minister urges more of this ""shielding"" group who are being asked to isolate completely to register. Even if they do need help at the moment, she suggests registering will be useful if they ever do need further help. She reports that more than 80,000 free deliveries of food packages have been made so far. Meanwhile, in addition, six supermarkets are offering priority deliveries and more than 33,000 people have expressed an interest. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Why we love the London Marathon Sunday was supposed to be the culmination of more than a million training miles and the collection of many millions more for good causes around the country and world. For some, despite the London Marathonâs postponement until October, it still will be. The 2.6 Challenge,,externalwhich aims to raise money for charity during the lockdown, begins on Sunday with people all around the country dreaming up creative activities to inspire donations and sponsorship. Here are some of the stories so farâ¦ Dr Eleanor Davis has been working extra shifts during the coronavirus pandemic Eleanor Davis was supposed to be on the startline of the elite race in South-East London on Sunday. She will still be pulling on her trainers, but instead it will be to run into one of Stockportâs covid wards where she works as a doctor. She is part of a 12-strong team of some of Britainâs top womenâs marathon runners who will each run 2.6 miles as part of a relay. Also involved are Jess Piasecki, the fastest British woman in 2019, Jo Pavey, a World and European medallist andHayley Carruthers, who crawled over the lineto a new personal best and viral fame in the 2019 race. Davis usually works part-time so that she can combine her medical career with her sporting one, but has been working extra shifts since the coronavirus pandemic extended to the UK. Although she has been covering longer distances at a slower pace over the past few weeks, the incentive of another virtual challenge inspired her to a new 5km personal best last week. She and her team-mates will be raising funds for mental health charity Mind. On the menâs side Dewi Griffiths, who missed last year's World Championships through illness, will be aiming to do two laps of his regular 5.5 mile training loop, clocking under 26 minutes for each. He will be raising money for Air Ambulance Wales. Baroness Grey-Thompson won the London Marathon six times from 1992-2002 Baroness Grey-Thompson won the London Marathon wheelchair race six times, in addition to 16 Paralympic medals, during her career. This will be the first time that she has not spent a spring day in the capital in 30 years of competing and commentating at the London Marathon. She will be doing 10.3km - ""a marathon is a bit beyond me these days!' - on the roads near to her house as she shares the full marathon distance with two colleagues from ukactive, a non-profit organisation promoting fitness for all that she chairs, who are raising money for the Trussell Trust, which supports food banks. Her kit will be different to that used during her racing days. ""I don't think I can vaguely fit my bottom in that anymore!"" she told BBC Sport when asked if she would be dusting off her old race chair. ""It was built for me when I weighed 45kgs and the diameter across the top was only nine inches. So I will be doing it in my day chair, which is fine. Ish! ""I still do lots of physical activity, just not in that race chair. My old wizened shoulders mean I use a hand bike, go to the gym and do lots of stretchy band work."" She and her colleagues are completing a total of five backyard marathons between them. For some, even the 26.2 is not enough. Kate Jayden, a 33-year-old compliance officer and endurance athlete, was supposed to be doing the London Marathon as her first race of 2020. The raceâs postponement has meant she has ended up doing more rather than less however. As you read this, her challenge has already begun with a 26.2-hour indoor cycle ride in her living room. She will climb off the bike at 02:20 BST on Sunday morning, before moving just a few yards to climb aboard a treadmill and begin a 26.2-mile run at 09:00 BST. âIâm known for doing crazy challenges but this one is a little crazy even by my standards,â said Jayden. âThe mental strength for this will be the real test on a treadmill and in the same place in the same room for so long.â Jenna Maudlin will be running each mile of her challenge a different way She will have some virtual company for the running leg of her challenge with friend Jenna Maudlin, in lockdown several hundred miles north in Scotland, completing 26.2 miles via more than 2,000 laps of a 20-metre course around the car park at her block of flats. She will be doing each mile in a different way, for example dressed as a dinosaur, side-stepping or galloping like a horse, after suggestions from her friends and sponsors. Maudlin, who has previously cycled from Lands End to John OâGroats and ran 17 marathons in 2017, hopes her variety of styles can compensate for the monotony of the course. âOne of the things I loved about those previous events, was seeing new things and new places and it helped with motivation, so running over 2,000 times round a car park is mentally going to be very tough!â she told BBC Sport. Jayden is raising money for Trussell Trust and Mind, while Maudlin is running for Age UK, Mind and Save the Children. Dr Adam Revill fell ill with coronavirus on 29 March. A consultant in the intensive care unit at Torbay Hospital, it would have wrecked his plans to run under three hours at the Manchester Marathon had the race not been postponed because of the outbreak. Thankfully his symptoms were relatively mild and he is back on the wards and back in his kit for a back-garden marathon, taking on his sister who is doing the same in her own garden in the Midlands. ""I think those 260 laps are going to be the hardest thing I have done,"" he told BBC Sport. ""Lots of turning corners, lots of ups and downs. I am aiming for four hours if we can. And to beat my sister if I can! ""It won't be the slowest marathon I have done though. I ran the Medoc Marathon in Bordeaux where the chateaus open up and crack open the good stuff for you. There is a six-and-a-half hour limit and we pushed it to the limit!"" Adam's daughter Ava has drawn a map of the route around the garden Cheered on by daughters Ava and Matilda, he is raising money for the Rowcroft Hospice. ""It costs about Â£8m to run their hospice, 75% of which comes from the community,"" he said. ""But because of the lockdown they are not raising any money from the shops or events like the London Marathon. It is an excellent cause."" David has Scooby outfits to suit all weathers David Smith is a veteran of the back-garden marathons. He has already completed âBrightonâ and âManchesterâ this month in his garden in Chesterfield â a total of just over 500 laps on each occasion, punctuated by a break for bacon sandwiches from the kitchen halfway through. On each occasion he brings some local flavour to the course by recreating local landmarks and his well-worn Scooby Doo fancy dress. âWe have a bicycle wheel for the London Eye and a wheelie bin representing Canary Wharf,â he told BBC Sport. âScooby Doo is the same age of me â 50 years old â and is still on TV today. Everyone recognises and connects with him. I have about three different Scooby Doo outfits â a warmer one for winter, a lightweight one for spring and then a summer one.â Before lockdown came into force, Smith claimed several marathon world records to his name, including the fastest controlling a tennis ball (four hours 13 minutes) and the fastest wearing bike leathers (four hours), set in the heat of the London race of 2018. All his efforts are to raise money for Sands, the stillborn and neonatal death charity. When not running, Smith works as a pharmacist, seeing first hand the stress and strain that coronavirus has brought to some of the most vulnerable in society. âWe have been extremely busy. There are a lot of people out there who are quite frightened, not only dispensing prescription, but advising people and delivering medication to the vulnerable. I have been very proud of my team, who have been coming in and working extra hours to help.â The 2.6 Challenge is being supported by a host of stars from stage, screen and sport including singer Ellie Goulding, actor Stephen Fry, Rugby World Cup winner Jonny Wilkinson, Wales and Real Madrid footballer Gareth Bale, British tennis number one Johanna Konta, Tour de France winner Chris Froome and a team of 26 Olympians creating a 26-minute workout video with a succession of 60-second cameos.

An 80-year-old grandmother has drawn attention on social media afterwearing a pig mask to talk to a friend. The image of Marlene Conrad, from Alrewas in Staffordshire, was liked almost 75,000 times when it was shared on Twitter by her granddaughter, Liz. She wears the mask as she believes it offers some protection when she talks to best friend Maureen Madden, whose garden adjoins her own. Liz, a teacher, said: ""It's whatever they can do to make each other smile. Although I'd probably be screaming if that appeared at my back gate."" Chelsea Flower Showwill be held virtually for the first timeafter it was cancelled due to coronavirus. The famous event has taken place at London's Royal Hospital Chelsea every year since 1913, apart from gaps during World War One and World War Two.

The 2.6 Challenge,,externalwhich aims to raise money for charity during the lockdown, has begun today with people all around the country dreaming up creative activities to inspire donations and sponsorship.

He usually trains most nights a week at the Unity Gym in Durham but because of lockdown he had to make do with his garden. He completed 26 rounds of boxing in memory of his baby cousin Phoebe who died in 2016 at 19 months from a rare condition.

Paulette Hamilton is the cabinet member for health and social care at Birmingham City Council People from South Asian backgrounds are being hit harder by coronavirus than other communities in the West Midlands, she said. Some research suggests the BAME community may be more at risk due to anincreased risk of certain health conditions such as diabetes and heart disease.  A man has run a marathon in his back garden, dressed as a rhinoceros. Andy Humphries from Blagdon in Somerset had been due to run the London Marathon in a rhino suit, in aid of Save The Rhino. Because the race was postponed because of coronavirus, he instead ran the 26.2 miles at home, and partly by running into his local village and back. He took about 6 hours 30 minutes to finish.  A councillor has spoken of his disbelief after
campers in a convoy of vans descended on a valley in Northumberland. Steven Bridgett, who represents Rothbury in
Northumberland, said a local resident spotted the campers setting out
deck chairs in Upper Coquetdale, and took this long-range snap. The independent council said Northumbria

hills have literally been alive with droves of tourists with no respect for
lockdown.""  With nightclubs closed, DJ sets have moved online while revellers party at home and interact in web chat rooms. Butwhat do they get out of it?

Oxford University's Prof Christophe Fraser told the BBC's Andrew Marr between three and 10% of the population was predicted to have contracted coronavirus by this stage - up to six million people. Prof Fraser is working on developing an app which would allow for tracing people who had been in touch with those with Covid-19. Prof Fraser said the app helps deal with the problem of 50% of transmissions taking place from people who are infected but not yet showing symptoms. He said with the software, people could be alerted if they had come into contact with a person with symptoms, in which case they should observe stronger social-distancing, or a confirmed case which would mean going into isolation.

They include people working in food production, energy supply and supermarket workers. According tonew government guidance,external, they can apply to be tested at one of four drive-through sites in Scotland.

"Spain records lowest daily death toll since 20 March, with 288 fatalities Children in Spain under 14 now allowed to go outside for the first time in six weeks A further 413 people have died in UK hospitals, bringing the total to 20,732 PM Boris Johnson will return to work on Monday UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab urges caution on easing lockdown The US can expect to continue social distancing over the summer, top health official Dr Deborah Birx says Edited by Alix Kroeger That's it from us today. Thank you for joining us. Here is a round-up of some of Sunday's key developments. For many people, the lockdown is about slowing down but Charli XCX has opted to keep herself busy by creating an entire album in just weeks. The singer plans to write and create an album with just the tools in her Los Angeles apartment. She's been getting fans involved by sharing demos on Instagram Live and posting ideas for lyrics to Twitter. The BBC's Mark Savage caught up with her via video chat to see how it's going. Read more here.,external Ruth Jones has transformed into her Gavin and Stacey character Nessa to remind people to stick to social-distancing rules. Speaking in a video posted on Twitter, Jones says: ""Don't even think about breaking that two-metre rule."" ""Stay safe, stay out of my way and protect the NHS,"" Jones adds. More than two million people have watched the video so far and it has been shared by members of the cast including James Corden and Larry Lamb. Allow Twitter content?

The mayor of San Juan, the largest city in Puerto Rico, says not a single person on the US island territory has yet received their $1,200 stimulus cheque from the US federal government. Mayor Carmen YulÃ­n Cruz told MSNBC on Saturday: âNo-one in Puerto Rico has received their $1,200 coronavirus stimulus cheques from the federal government. Weâre having problems with a local $500 cheque that the governor said was going to be distributed.â She added that there was a backlog of around 130,000 unemployment applications. Earlier this week,the islandâs treasury secretary,externalsaid around 486,000 Puerto Ricans should expect to receive an email this weekend informing them that they are eligible to receive the federal bailout money. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo says the death rate has dropped in the state, with 367 deaths on Saturday compared with 437 on Friday. He said that transmission rates, as well as death rates, would dictate how and when the state reopens. Cuomo added that asking public to remain in their homes indefinitely with nothing to do through the summer would be impossible. âThereâs a sanity equation here,â he says, pointing to reports that domestic violence, drug and alcohol abuse and mental health problems have already increased. High street shops considering reopening have been given advice from trade bodies on social distancing. The British Retail Consortium as well as union Usdawhave suggested stores should provide hand-sanitiser and limit the number of people shopping at one time, among other arrangements. It comes after Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said earlier that ""careful steps"" would be needed to bring the country out of lockdown. The advice for non-food retailers is similar to measures which have been put in place by supermarkets and other essential shops, including floor markings to remind customers about 2m social distancing and scheduling deliveries at times to avoid crowding. The UK has seen more warm weather this weekend leading to fears the public would disregard lockdown rules. In the video below, police can be seen dispersing sunbathers at Primrose Hill in London. In the UK people are allowed to leave their homes for exercise once a day but sunbathing or picnics are not allowed. This video can not be played Police in North London tell sunbathers to leave park An Australian mobile phone app, which notifies people if they have been in close contact with another user who has tested positive for coronavirus, has been launched. The contact-tracing app - based on one introduced in Singapore - uses bluetooth to ""ping"" or exchange a ""digital handshake"" with another user when they come within 1.5 metres of each other. Prime Minister Scott Morrison has said social restrictions could be eased if enough people download the app. The app needs to be downloaded by 40% of the population to be effective, according to the government. But concerns have been raised about privacy and the storing of personal information. Health Minister Greg Hunt described safeguarding measures as ""the strongest ever"", insisting only state health authorities can access the information. The data will be deleted after 21 days. Norway is among the countries to have already launched a contact tracing app Italy has seen its lowest daily death toll since 14 March, with the Civil Protection Agency recording another 260 deaths. It brings the total number of fatalities to 26,644, second only to the USA. Today's figures marked the third successive daily fall in deaths and were sharply down from 415 yesterday. Reality Check Prof Stephen Powis, the national medical director for NHS England, has said there is a âhintâ of a small increase in people driving during the lockdown. The government statistics show that the use of transport has plummeted since the end of February. For instance, London bus usage has dropped by around 85%, while the use of the Tube and National Rail is down by 95%. However, motor vehicle usage has been creeping up slowly - in the first week of the lockdown this was down 64% but is now only down 59%. Similarly, visits to parks and grocery stores have also seen small upticks, according to the latest analysis from Google. However, the Google data also shows a significant further decline in visits to workplaces. Children in Spain have been enjoying the outdoors on Sunday after being allowed out of their homes for the first time in six weeks. Spain has relaxed lockdown rules to allow under-14s to leave their homes each day for a total of one hour between 9am and 9pm. They had been banned from leaving their homes completely from 14 March. Some restrictions remain, however, preventing the children visiting public parks or venturing more than 1km. David ShukmanScience editor, BBC News A new estimate that more than 100,000 people could die of Covid-19 in the UK later this year has made headlines. It comes from a modelling study by scientists at Imperial College London and it assesses the risk of one particular scenario. The researchers assessed what might happen if everyone was released from lockdown apart from the most vulnerable. Only the elderly and people with underlying health conditions would remain shielded. According to Prof Neil Ferguson from Imperial, inan interview with the UnHerd website,,externalthese people were most at risk and were also those who most need support, therefore needing to have some interactions with their carers. Even if there could be an 80% reduction in the infection risk for that group, his study suggests that would still mean more than 100,000 dying. Itâs worth pointing out that at the moment, the UK government is giving no indication of how or when any lockdown restrictions might be relaxed. And the study itself has yet to be released â that may happen in the coming days. Whatever its conclusions â and these will be hotly debated â the work provides another reminder of the threat from the virus and the extreme difficulty of judging how best to ease the measures to tackle it. Victoria GillScience reporter, BBC News The UK went into lockdown to prevent the NHS becoming overloaded Lockdown was an emergency stop - the only immediately available measure to put the brakes on a virus that outpaced our ability to contain it. And it has worked. The best estimates are that the rate of infection in the UK is now at a point where the number of new infections is decreasing. To keep it there, though, the next step has to be a very careful one. Prof Neil Ferguson, one of the governmentâs key scientific advisers, explained in a podcast called UnHerd how taking the brakes off too abruptly would drive that infection rate back up and cost thousands more lives. What he and other scientists will do now is create models of different scenarios as we enter a new lockdown phase. With the best data they have on this very new disease, they will calculate the impact - on that all-important infection rate - of reopening schools, of easing travel restrictions and of opening up certain types of businesses. The post-lockdown restrictions on our lives - and there will be many - will be guided by those careful calculations. But it will be down to the government to weigh the risks and the benefits and to tell us what the next phase in our ânew normalityâ will look like. Police in France say they have seized 140,000 face masks that were destined for sale on the black market. Officers say they discovered the haul when they spotted a businessman unloading the masks from a lorry into a house in St Denis, north of Paris. France requisitioned all stocks and production of face masks to equip health workers. There have been several seizures of masks in the Paris region since the pandemic began. Read more here. Reality Check As the UK government struggles to reach its target to carry out 100,000 coronavirus tests a day by the end of April, it has  started to emphasise the capacity to do tests. At today's news conference, Environment Secretary George Eustice said: âWe have been ramping up our capacity to do those tests - it currently stands at over 50,000 a day.â But the latest daily number of tests actually done is just 29,058 - a minuscule increase on the figure given yesterday. In a previous briefing, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said he was confident that the governmentâs coronavirus testing target of 100,000 by the end of the April âwill be met in terms of capacityâ. But when the target was first announced by the Health Secretary Matt Hancock on 2 April it was clearly intended to mean 100,000 tests actually being done a day. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent Prime Minister Boris Johnson could possibly lead the daily news conference on Monday but, if not then, it will be pretty soon afterwards. As far as I understand, he will be getting briefed by his Downing St team early tomorrow morning and then he will be chairing the Covid-19 meeting, which is a smaller group of cabinet ministers. That is what he used to do before he was off sick. Chairing Monday's meeting is a measure of him saying, ""Iâm back in charge"". From what I've been told, and the conversations Iâve had with people in Whitehall and Downing St, the prime minister will proceed with caution when it comes to dealing with the lockdown. We would expect an announcement on 7 May, when all this is being reviewed again, and I do think at that stage he will take his foot off the brake ever so slightly. But he will move cautiously because he will not want to fuel a second wave of infections. Although they haven't yet set a clear route map out of lockdown, not in the same way as the devolved administrations in Scotland and Wales, those discussions are most certainly going on behind the scenes. Talks involving the prime minister have taken place from his country residence Chequers with senior Cabinet ministers. Police in India have arrested three men who are accused of gang-raping a woman who had been unofficially quarantined. The woman, a low wage worker, was trying to walk more than 100km (62 miles) to her home in Jaipur, Rajasthan, when she got lost. Police spotted her and told her to spend the night in a deserted school building, away from other people just in case she had the virus. But she was gang-raped there after dark. Indiaâs lockdown was imposed last month leaving tens of thousands of people without jobs. Some have walked for days in desperation to reach their homes. Read more about the situation in India. With most of the world's sport currently on hold, many fans are wondering what their favourite competitions will look like when they are allowed to safely resume. Perhapsthese pictures from Nicaraguaprovide a clue. Authorities in the Central American country have allowed sporting events to continue during the coronavirus pandemic - but a boxing event held on Saturday looked very different. The boxers wore masks during the ring walk and at a pre-bout face off, although they were allowed to remove them in the ring. Referees, judges, the media, fans and ring girls also wore masks. Fans had to sit two seats apart and had their temperature checked before entering the arena in the capital Managua. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Long-running  US  comedy sketch show Saturday Night Live (SNL) tapped Hollywood heartthrob Brad Pitt to play top disease expert Anthony Fauci - a mainstay of many White House coronavirus briefings. In the opening sketch, Pitt  fact-checks Trump's claims about the virus. âYes, the president has taken some liberties with our guidelines,â Pitt said. âSo tonight, I would like to explain what the president was trying to say.â The episode was the second recorded from the comedians' homes rather than live from New York City's Rockefeller Center. Earlier this month the 79-year-old director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases told CNN that he would want Pitt to portray him if he was ever lampooned by SNL. At the end of the routine, Pitt removes his silver wig and personally thanks Fauci for his ""calm and clarity in this unnerving time"". Â© 2025 BBC.

"The father of one of Scotland's largest families - Roy Hann - has tested positive for Covid-19 When lockdown measures were first announced, Roy and Emma Hann gave their children strict routines and organised family activities in a valiant effort to maintain order. The Hanns from Dundee areknown as one of Scotland's largest families- and with 10 of their 13 children living at home, their household was large enough to form two basketball teams. Despite the parents' best efforts, all order ""went out the window"" after the novelty wore off. Shattered nerves and bickering ensued as the family tried to cope with a less-than-peaceful new normal. But all tension subsided on Thursday when they learned Roy had tested positive for Covid-19. Roy in full PPE as he works with high acuity patients at Ninewells Hospital ""I'm a few days in and it's very mild,"" said Roy, a nurse practitioner at Ninewells Hospital. ""I was really surprised when I tested positive. ""I'm around so many Covid patients but I wear protective equipment and we're very proactive with testing in Tayside - so much so we're now listed as a hotspot. ""But we joke in work you're more likely to catch it from the supermarket - I just feel bad for being off."" The Hann household is now going through a 14-day quarantine - apart from Roy who will isolate for seven days. While the 50-year-old has type 2 diabetes, he says he generally keeps ""very well"" - he expects to return to full health and is keen to get back on the frontline of the pandemic. ""My life hadn't really changed, I just get to see my children more,"" he said. ""I'm actually glad I've had it, it makes me feel more confident about going back to work. ""There's so many in our house, we joke we're going for herd immunity."" Lockdown life - the Hanns have kept themselves entertained with family games With Roy in the house full-time, family life has become more manageable for cafÃ© owner Emma - but it's not without its challenges. The Hann children's ages range from five to 28 - at one stage the family got through 50 pints of milk, 21 loaves of bread and five large boxes of cereal each week. Now with social distancing at supermarkets and caps on products, buying food is more difficult than ever. ""The fact that we're a big family means social distancing guidelines are challenging for us,"" said Emma. ""To go to the shop and only buy three of an item means we need to go more often which exposes us more. To me it's quite a daunting situation."" Emma encouraged the youngest children to decorate a 'tuck shop' blackboard - which she now uses for 'bargaining' With work on hiatus, Emma's sole focus is looking after her children - her 28 years of experience has stood her in good stead, but the pressures of lockdown life have occasionally been overwhelming. She said: ""I went a walk the day before Roy tested positive and I started to hit a wall - I started crying. ""I thought I'm done and I just wanted a break because it was too hard. ""Weirdly the next morning when I told the family about Roy, they all took a bit of a moment - the last couple of days everyone has been pulling together a bit more."" Scotland's 'superfamily' set to welcome first grandchild With their sense of togetherness renewed, the Hanns continue to play basketball most nights in their garden. It's a simple pleasure - but one that has made all the difference. ""We feel very privileged,"" Emma said. ""We're very aware we have a garden. We've been in a situation where we had five kids in a flat and the idea of doing that now is terrible. ""I thought at the beginning of lockdown that structure would get me through it - but the reality is it doesn't work like that. ""My 14-year-old son is on his X-box for most of the night, while my daughter gets up at 6am to work from home - I didn't like it at first but it's actually easier to feed people in shifts. ""It's better to be flexible, we just have to do what we can."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

A further 368 people have died with coronavirus across England, Scotland and Wales, according to the latest figures from hospitals. NHS England said 336 deaths had been recorded, taking the total to 18,420. In Wales 14 more deaths have been recorded taking the total to 788 while in Scotland there have been 18 more deaths, a total of 1,249.

In other news, a motorcyclist has died after crashing with a Volvo on
Sunday morning in the Vale of Glamorgan. Police said the 62-year-old man was declared dead at the
scene, on the A4050 Port Road East in Barry. The crash happened at 11:15 BST, with the road remaining
closed from the roundabout near Brynhill Golf Club to the junction with Merthyr
Dyfan Road. South Wales Police said the man's family have been informed
and officers were investigating the circumstances. Public Health Wales says 9,078 people have now tested positive for Covid-19 in Wales. There have been 27,753 people tested. Dr Giri Shankar, from Public Health Wales, said: ""Based on the new case numbers there is emerging evidence suggesting a levelling-off in the number of new cases of Covid-19 in Wales, which may be an indication of the effectiveness of lockdown measures. ""However, it is still too early to tell for sure, and it is too soon to end the current social distancing rules."" Fourteen more people have died in Wales with Covid-19, Public Health Wales has said, taking the total to 788. This graph shows the number of  deaths reported each day. A total of 788 people in Wales have now died with Covid-19. This map shows the number of deaths reported by each health board. Another 14 people in Wales have died
with coronavirus - taking the total number to 788, Public Health Wales has
said. The
latest update from PHW showed there were 178 confirmed new cases, taking the

true number is likely to be higher as many with symptoms are not tested. People need to
know that the recording of coronavirus deaths ""can be relied upon"",Wales' first minister has said. Mark Drakeford said he will receive a report on the under-reporting of deaths in north Wales on Monday. The investigation was launched after it was revealed that Betsi Cadwaladr health boardfailed to report numbers daily for a whole month. Mr Drakeford also defended a delay in launching an online booking system for coronavirus tests for key workers. Speaking on theBBC's Politics Walesprogramme, he said further ""systems"" were becoming available to increase testing for key workers, rising from 1,300 tests to 1,800 available daily this week. Mr Drakeford said he wanted the online booking system for Wales to be ""robust"" before it was launched, pointing to problems with the system in England.

Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab says the prime minister is ""raring to go"" as he isdue to return to work tomorrow. Asked by the BBC's Andrew Marr if he had relished standing in during Boris Johnson's treatment for symptoms of coronavirus, Mr Raab said his job had been to ""step up just like the rest of the country"". ""When your prime minister is stricken with the coronavirus, and particularly when we knew it was touch and go, you're thinking very much personally of him but also the role of leading the government,"" he said. ""I also think of the country, and the position it's in. And like all of those key workers, like the rest of the country, my job is just to step up to the plate."" Re-opening Wales' museums should be a prioritywhen the relaxation of social distancing begins, according to the Museums Association. First Minister Mark Drakeford hasannounced seven testsfor any partial lifting of the lockdown. Museums Association director Sharon Heal believes smaller museums could be among the safest attractions to reopen when the time is right. She said museums were ""well-suited"" to opening by appointment only. Llandudno's Home Front Museum has one employee - its owner Buying drugs, nail clippers for the dog and not watching the news are just some of thebizarre excuses used for flouting the lockdown in Wales. Police forces have released examples of the reasons people have given for supposed âessentialâ travel. The lockdown has been in place for five weeks to stop the spread of the virus. Most people are following the advice to remain at home but police said a small number had ""selfishly put others at risk"". People found breaking the rules can be fined a fixed penalty fee of Â£60.
