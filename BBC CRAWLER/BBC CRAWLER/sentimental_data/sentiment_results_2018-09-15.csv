"Dudley Sutton played Tinker Dill in 70 episodes of the BBC hit Lovejoy Actor Dudley Sutton, known to millions as Tinker Dill from TV's Lovejoy, has died aged 85. A veteran of the small and big screen, he starred opposite Ian McShane's roguish antiques dealer in the BBC comedy-drama from 1986 to 1994. Former colleagues and co-stars paid tribute to the ""great actor and wonderful bloke"", who was diagnosed with cancer this year. Sutton's agent said he died peacefully surrounded by friends and family. Born in Surrey in April 1933, he served as an RAF mechanic before enrolling in the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. He was later expelled, but went on to join legendary stage director Joan Littlewood's Theatre Workshop group. After appearing in numerous plays during the 1950s and 1960s, Sutton's breakout screen role was the part of a gay biker in 1964's the Leather Boys. He later appeared in films such as The Devils, and The Pink Panther Strikes Again. Sutton starred alongside Ian McShane's titular antiques dealer (centre), and Chris Jury (left) But, speaking last year, Sutton acknowledged most audiences would remember him as Tinker, ""regardless of all the different and diverse stuff"" he had worked on. His other TV appearances included a special Christmas episode of BBC sitcom Porridge, in which he played hostage-taker Reg Urwin, and an instalment of ITV crime drama The Sweeney. In his later career he had a recurring role as conman Wilfred Atkins in EastEnders, as well as smaller parts in Holby City and Channel 4's teen drama Skins. Sutton died at the Royal Trinity Hospice in Clapham, south London. In July this year, he recorded a message from his bed praising staff at the NHS-run hospice, who he said had ""cared for him beautifully"". A message from his family said: ""Today we're devastated by the loss of our beautiful Dudley, who leaves a gaping hole in all our lives. ""We're grateful for the love expressed by friends and fans everywhere and for the extraordinary care he received at the [hospice], where he went out fighting for our NHS."" Former co-stars and showbiz friends also paid tribute to Sutton on social media. Fellow Lovejoy star Chris Jury, who played Eric Catchpole in the show, said he loved the actor ""dearly"".

"Joe Robinson was on holiday in Turkey when he was arrested by police A former soldier with the British army who fought for Kurdish forces against so-called Islamic State (IS) in Syria has been given a prison sentence in Turkey, his mother says. Joe Robinson, 25, from Leeds, was arrested while on holiday in 2017 and charged with terrorism offences. He was accused of being a member of the Kurdish armed group the YPG, which Turkey views as a terrorist group. Robinson was given a seven-and-a-half year sentence but remains on bail. He is planning an appeal against his conviction. His mother Sharon Chimejczuk said she had received a phone call on Friday night from an official at the British Foreign Office confirming his sentence. She said her son's fiancÃ©e, Mira Rojkan, a law student at the University of Leeds, had been given a suspended sentence for ""terrorism propaganda"". ""There was a trial, but Joe wasn't at it,"" Mrs Chimejczuk said. Ms Rojkan said: ""The court sentenced me for sharing Facebook posts with the Kurdish flag and links to Kurdish songs on YouTube. ""The situation is just so sad and ridiculous. ""It's beyond me how this can be happening."" Robinson spent five months fighting with Kurdish forces against IS in Syria Speaking to the BBC News Channel, Ms Rojkan, a Bulgarian national, said: ""Unfortunately for Joe, there was very little help from the Foreign Office. ""They are interested in the case and are following it, but didn't send any representatives and didn't help nearly as much as the Bulgarian foreign ministry."" Robinson, who is originally from Lancashire and previously served with British forces in Afghanistan, spent four months in a Turkish jail after his arrest last year. He was released on bail in November but has been prevented from leaving the country. He spent five months as a volunteer with Kurdish forces who were fighting against IS, and had previously spoken about his experiences in media reports. His family say he was a military medic. The YPG is regarded as a terrorist organisation by Turkey but is not a banned group in the UK.

"Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby has been a stern critic of payday loan firms The Church of England is to meet to consider leading a buyout of the collapsed payday lender Wonga. Wonga went into administration last month, prompting concern that the debts of thousands of borrowers could be passed to another high-interest firm. Last week, MP Frank Field called on the Archbishop of Canterbury to lead a consortium of ""good people"" to stop it being sold to ""another loan shark"". A church spokesman said it was ""reflecting"" on what might be possible. Administrators were officiallyappointed last monthto conduct an ""orderly wind-down"" of Wonga. Following the collapse, Mr Field wrote to Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby to express concern that borrowers could be ripped off if another payday lender bought the firm. He said Wonga's loan book was likely to be sold at a ""knockdown"" rate, which risked the possibility of the ""exploitation of the poor"". Mr Field said buying Wonga's Â£400m loan book would protect 200,000 borrowers from having to make repayments to another lender at high commercial rates. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he suggested that an ""alliance of financial forces"" could step in. This, he said, could act as a ""liberation of the poor"". ""I wrote to the administrators... to say would you please hold off on this fire-sale of this asset book until the archbishop's initiative can be seen through - and they have actually agreed to that,"" he added. Church commissioners - who manage the Church of England's Â£8.3bn investment fund - are expected to meet at Lambeth Palace next week to discuss the options. A Church spokesman said: ""We are reflecting on the letter from Frank Field to help determine what may or may not be possible in the months ahead regarding the repercussions following Wonga's collapse."" Archbishop Welby, who will lead the discussions, has previously been a critic of Wonga, saying he wanted to put payday lenders who charge high interest ""out of business"". In 2013, he said it was ""very embarrassing"" that the Church's pension fund indirectly invested in the firm. The Wonga proposals were revealed after theChurch said it was keeping its shares in Amazon,despite Archbishop Welby previously accusing the multinational company of ""leeching off the taxpayer"". He told the Trades Union Congress (TUC) on Wednesday that when ""vast companies like Amazon"" pay ""almost nothing in tax"" then there is something wrong with the tax system. However, the Church later said it considered the most effective way to seek change was to be ""in the room with these companies"" as a shareholder.

"This video can not be played Eyewitness recount the scene after the 'mariachi' fled Gunmen dressed as traditional mariachi musicians have killed five people and wounded eight in Mexico City, sending onlookers fleeing. They opened fire at a road crossing on the edge of the Plaza Garibaldi, a major tourist attraction packed with mariachi bars, police said. The gunmen then fled from the scene on motorbikes. Plaza Garibaldi borders the notorious Tepito district, home to the violent La UniÃ³n drugs gang. Two of those killed had convictions for robbery, AFP news agency reports, quoting a local official. Musicians stood around looking at the crime scene afterwards ""You come completely relaxed and to have a good time and then suddenly there are gunshots,"" one tourist in the area told Reuters news agency. ""You don't know if you're going to get back home. Now, you're not going to trust mariachis because the gunmen were dressed as mariachis."" Venezuelans charged over $2.3bn 'bribes' Jailed Lula pulls out of Brazilian vote 'If we stand together, they can't kill us' There was a heavy police presence around the Plaza Garibaldi in the wake of the shooting Tepito has suffered a wave of violence over the last month after the gang's presumed leader, Roberto Moyado Esparza - or  El Betito - was arrested. The number of killings in the city has surged since 2014. Nationwide, more than 200,000 people have been killed or have disappeared since December 2006, when Mexico's government declared war on organised crime. Mexico experienced its most violent year in 2017 with more than 25,000 murders, official figures suggest. It is the highest annual tally since modern records began.

"A review of the rail industry is to be launched by the government next week, following criticism of the way the franchising model is run. Labour said the model was ""broken"", after the East Coast Mainline franchise failed for the third time and passengers on other lines faced strikes and disruption to new timetables. The party says it will renationalise the railways if it gets into power. But the government says privatisation has helped ""transform"" the industry. The UK's rail network has been beset by problems, with the East Coast Mainline brought back under government control in May - for the third time in a decade. Meanwhile,members of the RMT union are holding the latest in a series of 24-hour strikeson Northern and South Western in a long-running dispute over the role of guards on trains. Hundreds of rail services are likely to be cancelled and replacement buses will operate on some routes. The review, to be announced on Thursday, is expected to be led by Keith Williams, the deputy chairman of department store John Lewis. It is likely to examine how issues such as those faced by the East Coast Mainline can be avoided in the future. The franchise was a joint venture between Stagecoach and Virgin Trains. This week theTransport Select Committee described the bid to run the line as ""naive"",externaland said the DfT must take the blame for not managing it effectively. The DfT plans to run the service as theLondon North Eastern Railwayuntil a new public-private partnership can be appointed in 2020. The government first began to offer Britain's passenger train services to the private sector to run on a franchised basis in the 1990s. The East Coast Mainline service run by Virgin was taken back under government control Transport secretary Chris Grayling has also faced questions over his handling of thedisruption faced by passengers on services run by Govia Thameslink and Northernthis year, following the introduction of new timetables. The Office of Rail and Road has launched an inquiry into the problems. Labour has said it would bring the railways back under public ownership if it was in power. Shadow Transport Secretary Andy McDonald said: ""Long-suffering rail passengers don't need a review to explain to them that the franchising system is broken beyond repair. ""No amount of tinkering will change the fact that rail franchising has failed, does not deliver and never will."" A Department for Transport spokesperson said: ""Privatisation has helped transform our railway, doubling passenger numbers and delivering more services, extra investment and new trains. ""We are absolutely committed to improving journeys and are always examining ways to improve how the railway serves passengers."" Paul Plummer, chief executive of the Rail Delivery Group which represents the rail industry, said the public and private sectors had achieved a lot working together over the last 20 years but ""the time is right for root and branch reform"".

"Lewis Bennett was given a seven-month jail sentence for smuggling stolen coins A British man murdered his wife and sank their catamaran off the coast of Cuba to end his ""marital strife"" and inherit her estate, US prosecutors say. Lewis Bennett, from Poole in Dorset, was rescued in May last year after sending an SOS message saying 41-year-old Isabella Hellmann was missing. He wasarrested on suspicion of murder in Februaryafter being given a jail sentence for smuggling stolen coins. Bennett is due to stand trial for second-degree murder in December. The FBI has accused Bennett of deliberately scuttling the 37ft (11m) vessel as the newlyweds sailed towards their US home. Court papers released after Bennett was charged say the family of Ms Hellmann - the mother of Bennett's daughter - put listening devices in her condo in Delray Beach, Florida, to record conversations. The family said they did this because they had become suspicious of Bennett. Prosecutor Benjamin Greenberg asked a Florida judge to admit into evidence conversations with loved ones in which Ms Hellmann is said to have discussed arguments about their finances and parenting. Mr Greenberg wrote: ""Hellmann's murder would remove the marital strife from the defendant's life, allow the defendant to live his life as he pleased, and would enable him to inherit money from Hellmann's estate."" He said there was ""strong circumstantial proof"" of a motive for murder. Bennett reported his wife missing in an SOS call as their catamaran was sinking Prosecutors also alleged Ms Hellmann may have found out he had stolen gold and silver coins from his former employer in St Maarten, which could have made her an accomplice in the smuggling crime. Mr Greenberg wrote that this ""potentially led to an intense argument resulting in Hellmann's murder"". Bennett is currently serving a seven-month jail sentence after pleading guilty to transporting the coins worth $38,480 (Â£29,450). Ms Hellmann's body has yet to be found.

"On opposite sides of the world, two major storms have forced people to flee their homes and are threatening to bulldoze infrastructure and buildings. In the US, officials warn that Hurricane Florence could cause ""catastrophic"" flooding which could kill ""a lot of people"" on the country's east coast. Meanwhile, a super typhoon has arrived in the Philippines and officials say more than five million people are in its path. The looming disasters have prompted people to prepare their homes and stock up on supplies. But what is best practice? And how can you cope once a storm has hit? Here's what officials from both countries advise... Images of people in the US boarding up the windows of their homes and businesses are commonplace when a hurricane is nearing land. But the government's advice, posted as part ofthe Ready Campaign,,externalsuggests that installing permanent storm shutters in advance is the safest option. If there is no time then it advises using ""exterior grade or marine plywood"" to board up your windows. ""There could be a lot of debris and loose items that become projectiles,"" James Joseph, from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), tells the BBC. ""The heavy winds will pick items up and they could smash through windows."" Four reasons to fear Hurricane Florence Where is being hit by the storm? A guide to the world's deadliest storms When a hurricane hits, then, it's best to shelter in a windowless room or hallway on the lowest floor of a building, providing that it's not at risk of flooding. ""If you get trapped in a flooded building, go to the highest floor but do NOT enter a closed attic,"" FEMA tweeted as Hurricane Florence approached landfall on Friday. In the Philippines, people in the path of Super Typhoon Mangkhut have been readying their homes by tying down their roofs with rope. Residents of vulnerable makeshift houses near the coast have had to improvise ways to secure their properties. Some have weighed down their roofs with tyres and shuttered their windows with any materials they can find. ""Examine your house and repair its unstable parts,"" advice from the Philippine Red Cross (PRC) says. It suggests securing pets in a safe place, storing your most important belongings on high ground, and turning off the main power switch. Once a home is secured and prepared then people may either bed down to ride the storm out, or - if they're subject to an evacuation warning - move to a safer place. ""The biggest mistake people make is not heeding the warnings,"" Mr Joseph says. ""They find themselves in very dangerous situations."" More than a million people have been ordered to leave the coasts of the Carolinas and Virginia, with more than 20,000 taking refuge in emergency shelters. Similarly in the Philippines, thousands of people are being evacuated from their homes and placed in temporary shelters. But what should people bring with them when leaving? According to official advice in the US, an emergency preparedness kit should include: Three days' worth of food and water Medicine A torch Batteries Money First aid kit The PRC advice adds that candles and battery-powered radios should be easily accessible. Once the worst of a storm has subsided and people are able to return home, there are still a number of dangers, officials say. ""Avoid wading in floodwater, which can contain dangerous debris. Underground or downed power lines can also electrically charge the water,"" the Ready Campaign warns. It also advises wearing protective clothing when cleaning up, and working with someone else. ""You don't want to get injured in a situation when you're alone,"" Mr Joseph says. ""Cell phone services might not be working so you definitely want to at least be in a pair so if anything occurs the other person can seek assistance for you."" He adds that people should not enter their home if the area has been closed off by the police or fire department. ""First responders need to ensure that the power has been turned off and any open gas lines have been turned off,"" he says. ""We don't want there to be another emergency or disaster within the already existing disaster."" Officials say floodwater can pose a number of different dangers In the Philippines there are some more unique risks. ""Beware of poisonous animals like snakes that may have entered your house,"" safety tips issued by the National Police in 2014 say. The PRC also says to avoid letting floodwater accumulate in cans or pots to avoid ""creating a favourable condition for mosquito breeding."" It adds that any damaged electrical cables and posts should be reported to the authorities.

"Typhoon Mangkhut has passed through the Philippines' main island of Luzon, causing landslides, flooding and deaths. The storm has damaged all the buildings in Tuguegarao City in the island's north-east, according to a government official. Deadly typhoon wreaks Philippines carnage Here's how to survive a monster storm Carmelo Lasam is a lawyer who lives in the city and saw out the storm at home with his family: ""Me, my wife and my five girls, two granddaughters, all cowering with fear"". The next day, they surveyed the damage. Carmelo said he is used to typhoons, but the younger members of his family are not. ""I've grown up with them. There is nothing more ferocious,"" he told the BBC. ""We didn't sleep the whole night. I kept assuring them, 'These things pass'. ""It took so long hovering over us, it was really terrible. ""And it did pass. We're survivors, no injuries. We thank the Lord - I have never prayed so hard in my life."" In pictures: Typhoon lashes Philippines Hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones: What's the difference? However, the roof of the family house, their garage and the gates were damaged. Part of the roof blew off the Lasam family's house On Saturday afternoon, Carmelo and his daughter Luke went around the city to see what had happened. ""We saw widespread damage everywhere. ""My heart goes out to the people in small houses. It's always the poor who suffer first in calamities. ""The farmers, they're about to harvest their crops - I was praying for them."" Carmelo saluted the local government and their ""considerable"" efforts. ""They were going around town since yesterday, telling people to evacuate low-lying areas."" Meanwhile, other people in Tuguegarao have begun clearing up. ""People are surveying the damage of their town, fixing stuff,"" said Carmelo. ""Some are going around in a daze, not knowing what to do. ""Tomorrow, I'll go out, buy rice and canned goods."" Hurricanes: A guide to the world's deadliest storms Reality Check: Are hurricanes getting worse? Although the internet - ""our only lifeline"" - was restored on Saturday morning, Carmelo said electric lines are still down so they still can't get online. Now into a second night, with his house lit by candles, Carmelo said he could not rest. ""My family, they're all asleep now. I'm still up.

"This video can not be played Watch the Delta II rocket launch from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California The American space agency has launched a laser into orbit to measure the condition of Earth's ice cover. The satellite mission, called ICESat-2, should provide more precise information on how these frozen surfaces are being affected by global warming. Antarctica, Greenland and the ice floating on the Arctic Ocean have all lost volume in recent decades. ICESat-2 will track ongoing change in unprecedented detail from its vantage point some 500km above the planet. The satellite was taken up by a Delta II rocket, flying out of Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. Robots ahoy! Mapping Earth's surface Wind mapping satellite lifts off Biggest ever Antarctic field campaign As the name suggests, ICESat-2 is a follow-on project. The original spacecraft flew in the 2000s and pioneered the laser measurement of the height of polar glaciers and sea-ice from space. But the mission was plagued by technical problems that limited its observations to just a couple of months in every year. Nasa has since re-modelled the technology, both to make it more reliable and to give it a sharper view. ""ICESat-2 is going to observe the cryosphere with a spatial resolution at the level we have never seen before from space,"" explained Prof Helen Fricker from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. ""The beam is split across-track into six - three pairs - so we can map more of the ice surface as well as estimating the surface slope, which can confuse our interpretation of height changes. ""The orbit reaches to two degrees of the poles, and the same ground tracks are sampled every three months, giving us seasonal snapshots of ice height. From these data we can unravel the processes responsible for the ice loss in the polar regions,"" she told BBC News. Artwork: ICESat-2 fires 10,000 shots a second as it moves around the Earth Antarctica and Greenland lose billions of tonnes of ice every year - the result largely of warm water being able to melt land glaciers where they meet the ocean. This wastage is slowly but surely pushing up sea-levels worldwide. In the Arctic, the seasonal floes have also been in retreat. Sea-ice in the far north is thought to have lost two-thirds of its volume since the 1980s. And although this has no direct impact on the height of the oceans, the reduced ice-cover is working to amplify temperature rises in the region. Much of the change that is occurring at the poles can present itself in quite subtle ways, says Dr Tom Neumann, Nasa's ICESat-2 deputy project scientist, and a very precise tool is needed to characterise it properly. ""An elevation change of just a centimetre over an ice sheet the scale of Antarctica represents a tremendous amount of water either gained to or lost by the ice sheet. 140 gigatonnes worth."" Mission launches to weigh Earth's water This video can not be played Tom Neumann: ""IceSAT-2's laser is a totally different design"" Weighing half a tonne, the new laser system is one of the largest Earth-observation instruments ever built by Nasa. It uses a technique called ""photon counting"". It fires about 10,000 pulses of light every second. Each of those shots goes down to the Earth and bounces back up on a timescale of about 3.3 milliseconds. The exact time equates to the height of the reflecting surface. ""We fire about a trillion photons (particles of light) in every shot. We get about one back,"" says Cathy Richardson, who works on the team at Nasa that developed the instrument. ""We can time that one photon when it comes back just as accurately as when it left the instrument. And from that we can calculate a distance to about half a centimetre on the Earth."" The laser is making a measurement every 70cm as it moves forward across the ice. The $1bn mission is funded initially to run for three years It is hoped that ICESat-2 can help produce the first robust maps of sea-ice thickness in the Antarctic. At the moment, the technique for assessing ice floes really only works in the Arctic. It involves comparing the height of that part of the floating ice sticking above the water with the height of the ocean surface itself. Because scientists know the density of seawater and ice, they can then calculate how much ice must be submerged, and thus a total overall thickness. In the Antarctic, though, this approach is problematic. In the far south, the ice floes can get covered in substantial dumps of snow. This will sometimes push the sea-ice fully under the water and confound the thickness calculation. The proposed solution is to combine ICESat's laser observations, which reflect off the top of the snow surface, with those of radar satellites, whose microwave beams penetrate more deeply into the snow covering. This will reduce a lot of uncertainty. Scientists need  thickness measurements to properly access the status of floes. Sometimes the wind will spread the ice out; other times it will pile the ice up. The difference is only apparent when the ice is viewed in three dimensions. And, no, the laser does not have the power to melt the ice from 500km up! But on a dark night you might just be able to see a green dot when ICESat flies overhead.

It is slowly grinding over the eastern states, with winds of 65mph (105km/h). Five deaths have been linked to the storm and thousands of people have been staying in emergency shelters. Evacuation warnings were issued for 1.7 million people in the region. Maps: Where is the storm hitting now? Here's how to survive a monster storm Rescue workers from other parts of the country, including this crew from New York, have been helping in the Carolinas All five deaths linked to the storm are in North Carolina: A mother and her infant were killed in Wilmington when a tree fell on their home on Friday. Officials say the child's father was also transported to hospital for injuries Two men in their 70s were killed in Lenoir County. One was killed when connecting an electrical generator, and family members say another man was killed in a wind-related death when checking on dogs outside his property A woman died from cardiac arrest in the town of Hampstead after emergency responders had their route to her blocked by downed trees, a county official said The storm originally made landfall at Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina, on Friday morning as a category one hurricane. Volunteers are helping to rescue residents from flooded homes ""Catastrophic fresh water flooding"" is expected in parts of both the Carolinas,external, the National Hurricane Center said late on Friday local time. Some parts of North Carolina have already seen surges as high as 10ft in places. North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper said the hurricane was likely to ""continue its violent grind for days"" and described the severity of the downfalls as a ""1,000 year event"". This video can not be played The Weather Channel uses virtual reality to show deadly storm surge Florence is expected to dump 18 trillion gallons of rainwater on US soil, meteorologist Ryan Mauetweeted,external. Almost 800,000 people are reported to be without power already in North Carolina, and officials have warned restoring electricity could take days or even weeks. More than 20,000 residents have packed into North Carolina emergency shelters, and officials have told those still in the storm's path to stay in place. In Jacksonville, North Carolina, officials had rescued more than 60 people overnight on Thursday from a hotel that was collapsing in the storm. Parts of New Bern, North Carolina, which is home to 30,000 people, were 10ft underwater on Friday after local rivers flooded their banks. Scores of residents in the riverfront city were plucked to safety, local reports say. The Cajun Navy, a volunteer rescue group, were among those travelling by boat around the town to help people who were trapped. Officials have warned residents against entering attics, so as to avoid drowning, unless they have a means to cut through to the roof.

A guide to the world's deadliest storms  Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters.Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds.

Swipe to progress  The relationship between climate change and hurricanes is a complex one. Warmer seas power hurricanes. So as the temperature of ocean water goes up, we might expect the intensity of hurricanes to increase in future. A hotter atmosphere can also hold more water, so this should allow hurricanes to dump more water on affected areas. But there are so many factors that contribute to these rare events, it has been difficult to tease out clear trends from the data.

The riverside town of New Bern (population 30,000) suffered massive flooding. Aerial photos show the extent of the flooding in New Bern ""If you are not watching the waters they do rise very quickly, giving you very little time to get out,"" public information officer Colleen Roberts told BBC World News. She said over 4,000 homes had been ""destroyed or completely damaged"", based on calls they had received for emergency services. ""That's preliminary at this point. And we have 300 businesses that are damaged or destroyed. We had a very popular lifestyle and winter wear company that people loved and the roof collapsed under the weight of rainwater,"" she said. ""New Bern is a quaint historic down town, about ten square blocks, and it was significantly under water during this storm in ways that most people have never seen since they've been here."" The centre of the storm moved slowly westward on Saturday across the Carolinas, bringing further heavy rain and flooding. the US National Hurricane Center says. It is expected to weaken gradually as it moves inland, heading northwards through the Ohio valley by Monday. Maps: Where is the storm hitting now?

"This rollercoaster was stuck 50ft (15m) in the air Twenty-one people, including several children, were rescued after a rollercoaster at the Gulliver's World theme park became stuck. Fire crews used ladders and scaffolding to rescue the stranded passengers, which stopped 50ft (15m) in the air. Crews were called to the venue in Warrington, Cheshire, at about 13:10 BST and spent about two hours rescuing the passengers. Witnesses described seeing crying children on the ride. A mother described how it stalled while her seven-year-old daughter was on the rollercoaster. ""Two wheels came off the ride and it stopped suddenly. ""Kids were screaming and staff just stood there basically not knowing what to do for 20 minutes,"" said the woman, who asked not to be named. ""I'm just glad she's safe but as a mother it was one of the most terrifying things I've ever seen. ""The ride looks unsafe and needs to be shut."" Firefighters used two ropes to lower three people to safety, and said everyone had been rescued by just after 15:30 BST.

"More details have emerged about government plans to overhaul ""archaic"" divorce laws in England and Wales. Couples wishing to divorce could soon benefit from a less confrontational process, under proposals confirmed by the Justice Secretary David Gauke. The government has launched a consultation proposing removing the need to allege ""fault"", and the right of spouses to contest a divorce. Mr Gauke said the current divorce laws were ""out of touch with modern life"". Under the current law, unless people can prove their marriage has broken down due to adultery, unreasonable behaviour or desertion, the only way to obtain a divorce without a spouse's consent is to live apart for five years. If the separation is mutual, the couple have to prove they have been separated for a minimum of two years before they can divorce. Mr Gauke said: ""We think that the blame game that currently exists helps nobody. It creates unnecessary antagonism and anxiety at an already trying time for couples."" The blame game: Divorcing in the UK Divorce laws 'archaic' says celebrity lawyer Should it be easier to get a divorce? The proposed changes,which were leaked earlier this month,include making ""the irretrievable breakdown of a marriage"" the sole grounds for a divorce. It is also recommending removing the need to show evidence of a spouse's conduct, or a period of living apart. The 12-week consultation also proposes a new notification process where one, or possibly both parties, can simply notify the court of their intention to divorce, removing the opportunity for the other spouse to contest the divorce application. The changes would apply to both marriages and civil partnerships. Tini Owens was refused a divorce by the family court and Court of Appeal Pressure for reform intensified after a woman's appeal for divorce wasrejected by the Supreme Courtin July due to her husband's refusal to split. Tini Owens, 68, wanted to divorce on the grounds she was unhappy but her husband of 40 years refused the split, leading the court to rule against her ""with reluctance"". That meant she must remain married until 2020 - as currently the only way to obtain a divorce without a spouse's agreement is to live apart for five years. Mr Gauke said the case had ""generated broader questions about what the law requires of people going through divorce and what it achieves in practice"". There had been a ""growing coalition recognising that the animosity that is put into this system is one that is not doing us any good,"" he said. Shadow Justice Secretary Richard Burgon had previously urged the government to simply change the law rather than undertaking a consultation. Hannah Cornish, head of family law at Slater and Gordon, said there was a ""desperate need"" for reform. She added: ""Having to place blame can really inflame matters at what can already be a stressful and difficult time for a family."" Ministers also want views on the minimum time between the interim and final divorce decree in order to allow couples time to reflect and reach agreement on arrangements for the future if divorce is inevitable. When you apply for a divorce you must prove your marriage has broken down and give one of the following five reasons: Adultery Unreasonable behaviour Desertion You have lived apart for more than two years and both agree to the divorce You have lived apart for at least five years, even if your husband or wife disagrees Source: Gov.UK New fire erupts in Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Paris Hilton among stars 'heartbroken' as she watches home 'burn to ground' Commuters warned of icy roads as cold snap continues to freeze UK Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

"British law enforcement officers fighting money laundering are being frustrated by a lack of co-operation by the authorities in the Cayman Islands. The National Crime Agency said it was ""asking for information we don't get"". It says it has also significantly stepped up efforts to seize dirty Russian money coming into the UK. It has also launched investigations into British-based lawyers and accountants suspected of facilitating money laundering. The NCA leads the UK fight against money laundering and criminal money, which it estimates could be worth up to Â£1bn a day. Cayman Islands profile What are Britain's overseas territories? Oligarchs in UK told to explain wealth Ministers back down on tax haven registers A number of its investigations have led it to offshore firms registered in the Cayman Islands, which is a British Overseas Territory in the Caribbean and one of the world's largest financial centres. Donald Toon, director of the NCA, revealed the Cayman Islands authorities had not co-operated when he had asked for information on who owned these firms. He said that usually when his officers asked British Overseas Territories for help ""we can generally get from them clear, unambiguous beneficial ownership information but we are having a difficulty with Cayman"". ""The Cayman government is entirely aware of the UK concerns,"" he said. In recent years the spotlight has been on tax havens linked to the UK following a series of global investigations involving nearly 100 media organisations, including the BBC. The Paradise Papersexposed how wealthy and corrupt individuals used complex offshore structures to cover their tracks. The NCA said there were now signs that criminals were finding new tax havens where they could exploit lax regulation and hide their links to corrupt assets. These were jurisdictions ""well beyond the British Overseas Territories"". Mr Toon called them ""small island nations"" where ""people are able to register companies but are much more difficult to penetrate in terms of getting access to the information"" on beneficial owners. He did not say where. This video can not be played London is home to corrupt individuals buying assets to hide their illicit wealth. Mr Toon also said the NCA had significantly stepped up its work to identify and seize corrupt Russian assets in the UK - but it was yet to use new powers, known asUnexplained Wealth Orders,against them. Unexplained Wealth Orders, which came into force on 31 January, force wealthy people to explain the source of their assets if there is reason to suspect corruption. ""This is not quick work,"" Mr Toon explained, because rich criminals are experts at hiding their ownership of corrupt assets. He revealed there were ""a couple of dozen"" active investigations into lawyers and accountants suspected of facilitating the flow of dirty money into the UK which he described as the ""lifeblood of nearly all organised crime"". Asked if he was concerned that dirty money was being used to fund the private education of the children of corrupt oligarchs, Mr Toon said those private schools with charitable status have to carry out due diligence. However, he said they rarely issue alerts to law enforcement. What can be done about London's dirty money? Video, 00:03:31What can be done about London's dirty money?

"The g-force pushed blood into Tyler's head which caused him to pass out, his mum said An 11-year-old boy could have died while attempting to recreate a ""stupid"" YouTube stunt, his mum has said. Tyler Broome passed out while being spun at high speed on a park roundabout using the back wheel of a moped. His mother Dawn Hollingworth said doctors told her his injuries were usually seen in fighter pilots suffering the effects of g-force. She warned others not to copy the ""silly prank"", which could have had ""life-changing consequences"" for Tyler. The schoolboy was with a group of older children at the park in Tuxford, Nottinghamshire, when he suggested they imitate the stunt, which features in hundreds of videos shared online. A video released by Ms Hollingworth, 51, shows him spread-eagled across the top of the roundabout as it spins around. At the end of the recording, he appears to fall down, his head flopping forward as the equipment comes to a stop. Blood rushed to the youngster's head, causing swelling and bruising to his face, Ms Hollingworth said. ""The clips I have seen, everybody gets chucked off,"" she said. ""In Tyler's case he passed out from the g-force. ""His vision is all blurred and his eyes are red, filled with blood,"" she said. ""He got off, he was sick and dropped to his knees and passed out again on the field."" The teenagers Tyler was with left him alone in the park when he became unwell. But he was helped by another boy who was passing by, his mum said. ""The doctors said if he was not fit and healthy he could have quite easily had a stroke and died."" Ms Hollingworth said she wanted to raise awareness of the dangers of the stunt . ""Tyler is aware he has done wrong and his injuries are caused by his own stupidity. ""But once he was unconscious he was unable to consent but they carried on and left him."" Tyler was left with facial bruising but the consequences could have been far worse, doctors said Doctors likened Tyler's injuries to those sustained by fighter pilots when they are not wearing an oxygen mask, Ms Hollingworth said. Medics asked for her consent to write a medical paper, as they had never seen a case like it, she said. Nottinghamshire Police has appealed for witnesses, or anyone else with video of Wednesday's incident, to come forward. The force said Tyler sustained serious head injuries and remained in hospital in a serious but stable condition.

"On opposite sides of the world, two major storms have forced people to flee their homes and are threatening to bulldoze infrastructure and buildings. In the US, officials warn that Hurricane Florence could cause ""catastrophic"" flooding which could kill ""a lot of people"" on the country's east coast. Meanwhile, a super typhoon has arrived in the Philippines and officials say more than five million people are in its path. The looming disasters have prompted people to prepare their homes and stock up on supplies. But what is best practice? And how can you cope once a storm has hit? Here's what officials from both countries advise... Images of people in the US boarding up the windows of their homes and businesses are commonplace when a hurricane is nearing land. But the government's advice, posted as part ofthe Ready Campaign,,externalsuggests that installing permanent storm shutters in advance is the safest option. If there is no time then it advises using ""exterior grade or marine plywood"" to board up your windows. ""There could be a lot of debris and loose items that become projectiles,"" James Joseph, from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), tells the BBC. ""The heavy winds will pick items up and they could smash through windows."" Four reasons to fear Hurricane Florence Where is being hit by the storm? A guide to the world's deadliest storms When a hurricane hits, then, it's best to shelter in a windowless room or hallway on the lowest floor of a building, providing that it's not at risk of flooding. ""If you get trapped in a flooded building, go to the highest floor but do NOT enter a closed attic,"" FEMA tweeted as Hurricane Florence approached landfall on Friday. In the Philippines, people in the path of Super Typhoon Mangkhut have been readying their homes by tying down their roofs with rope. Residents of vulnerable makeshift houses near the coast have had to improvise ways to secure their properties. Some have weighed down their roofs with tyres and shuttered their windows with any materials they can find. ""Examine your house and repair its unstable parts,"" advice from the Philippine Red Cross (PRC) says. It suggests securing pets in a safe place, storing your most important belongings on high ground, and turning off the main power switch. Once a home is secured and prepared then people may either bed down to ride the storm out, or - if they're subject to an evacuation warning - move to a safer place. ""The biggest mistake people make is not heeding the warnings,"" Mr Joseph says. ""They find themselves in very dangerous situations."" More than a million people have been ordered to leave the coasts of the Carolinas and Virginia, with more than 20,000 taking refuge in emergency shelters. Similarly in the Philippines, thousands of people are being evacuated from their homes and placed in temporary shelters. But what should people bring with them when leaving? According to official advice in the US, an emergency preparedness kit should include: Three days' worth of food and water Medicine A torch Batteries Money First aid kit The PRC advice adds that candles and battery-powered radios should be easily accessible. Once the worst of a storm has subsided and people are able to return home, there are still a number of dangers, officials say. ""Avoid wading in floodwater, which can contain dangerous debris. Underground or downed power lines can also electrically charge the water,"" the Ready Campaign warns. It also advises wearing protective clothing when cleaning up, and working with someone else. ""You don't want to get injured in a situation when you're alone,"" Mr Joseph says. ""Cell phone services might not be working so you definitely want to at least be in a pair so if anything occurs the other person can seek assistance for you."" He adds that people should not enter their home if the area has been closed off by the police or fire department. ""First responders need to ensure that the power has been turned off and any open gas lines have been turned off,"" he says. ""We don't want there to be another emergency or disaster within the already existing disaster."" Officials say floodwater can pose a number of different dangers In the Philippines there are some more unique risks. ""Beware of poisonous animals like snakes that may have entered your house,"" safety tips issued by the National Police in 2014 say. The PRC also says to avoid letting floodwater accumulate in cans or pots to avoid ""creating a favourable condition for mosquito breeding."" It adds that any damaged electrical cables and posts should be reported to the authorities.

"Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby has been a stern critic of payday loan firms The Church of England is to meet to consider leading a buyout of the collapsed payday lender Wonga. Wonga went into administration last month, prompting concern that the debts of thousands of borrowers could be passed to another high-interest firm. Last week, MP Frank Field called on the Archbishop of Canterbury to lead a consortium of ""good people"" to stop it being sold to ""another loan shark"". A church spokesman said it was ""reflecting"" on what might be possible. Administrators were officiallyappointed last monthto conduct an ""orderly wind-down"" of Wonga. Following the collapse, Mr Field wrote to Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby to express concern that borrowers could be ripped off if another payday lender bought the firm. He said Wonga's loan book was likely to be sold at a ""knockdown"" rate, which risked the possibility of the ""exploitation of the poor"". Mr Field said buying Wonga's Â£400m loan book would protect 200,000 borrowers from having to make repayments to another lender at high commercial rates. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he suggested that an ""alliance of financial forces"" could step in. This, he said, could act as a ""liberation of the poor"". ""I wrote to the administrators... to say would you please hold off on this fire-sale of this asset book until the archbishop's initiative can be seen through - and they have actually agreed to that,"" he added. Church commissioners - who manage the Church of England's Â£8.3bn investment fund - are expected to meet at Lambeth Palace next week to discuss the options. A Church spokesman said: ""We are reflecting on the letter from Frank Field to help determine what may or may not be possible in the months ahead regarding the repercussions following Wonga's collapse."" Archbishop Welby, who will lead the discussions, has previously been a critic of Wonga, saying he wanted to put payday lenders who charge high interest ""out of business"". In 2013, he said it was ""very embarrassing"" that the Church's pension fund indirectly invested in the firm. The Wonga proposals were revealed after theChurch said it was keeping its shares in Amazon,despite Archbishop Welby previously accusing the multinational company of ""leeching off the taxpayer"". He told the Trades Union Congress (TUC) on Wednesday that when ""vast companies like Amazon"" pay ""almost nothing in tax"" then there is something wrong with the tax system. However, the Church later said it considered the most effective way to seek change was to be ""in the room with these companies"" as a shareholder.

"This video can not be played Flash floods and landslides have led to fatalities in the Philippines Some 14 people have been killed in a massive storm which brought destruction to the northern Philippines, a presidential adviser says. Typhoon Mangkhut ripped through the Philippines' main island of Luzon, and is now moving west towards China. The storm tore off roofs, felled trees, triggered 42 landslides and caused extensive flooding. Mangkhut unleashed winds of 185km/h (115mph) as it careered from east to west across the north of Luzon. Five million people were in its path, and thousands were evacuated. Almost all buildings in the city of Tuguegarao - the capital city of the north-eastern Cagayan province - sustained some damage, a government official said, and communications were down in places. Francis Tolentino, a political adviser to President Rodrigo Duterte, said up to 14 people were killed as a result of the storm. Two rescuers died trying to help people trapped in a landslide. Unverified reports say the body of a young girl was found in the Marikina river, which flows through Manila. Residents of Gonzaga province after a night in an evacuation centre The mayor of the Baguio City said five people were killed there. Mauricio Domogan told CNN Philippines a similar number were also missing and the sewerage system was being overwhelmed by the floodwaters. The evacuation centre in the coastal town of Aparri is said to have been destroyed and phone networks are down. BBC correspondent Jonathan Head, who is in Luzon, saw 200 people who had taken shelter in one school being re-evacuated because a dyke holding back a swollen river was about to burst. The full cost of Typhoon Mangkhut on one of the country's most important food-producing regions cannot yet be assessed, he says. The typhoon recalls memories of the deadliest storm on record in the Philippines - Super Typhoon Haiyan in 2013 - which killed more than 7,000. However, preparation and evacuation procedures have been improved since then. In pictures: Typhoon lashes Philippines Lawyer in Tuguegarao: Some are in a daze How to survive a monster storm Hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones: What's the difference? The typhoon made landfall at Baggao, in the north-east of the Philippines, at about 01:40 local time on Saturday (17:40 GMT on Friday), and left the country some 20 hours later. After losing some of its wind speed over land as it headed west, the storm was downgraded from a super typhoon. It is forecast to weaken slightly as it approaches China from the south-east. The storm - known locally as Ompong - has a cloud diameter of about 900km and is heading west at about 30km/h. The World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) billed the storm asthe strongest tropical cyclone the world has faced so far this year,external. Some residents of Aparri were still able to amuse themselves Inhabitants of Alcala inspected damage The typhoon is forecast to pass near Hong Kong on Sunday afternoon. In nearby Macau, shops have been boarded up and residents have been sticking tape on their windows. The typhoon is expected to weaken into a tropical depression by Tuesday. Authorities in the Philippines have said they were better prepared for the storm than in previous years. Warnings were issued in dozens of provinces. Travel by sea and air was restricted. Flights were cancelled, schools shut and the army was on standby.

Reality Check: Are hurricanes getting worse? ""We are really frightened,"" Delaila Pasion, who had fled her home, told AFP news agency. ""They say it is so strong, we were too scared to remain."" ""During previous monsoon rains, half of our house was destroyed so I wanted to take my grandchildren to safety,"" she told journalists. The Philippines is routinely hit during the typhoon season. In China, where the storm is predicted to hit late on Sunday or early on Monday, the authorities have raised storm alerts to ""yellow"", which is the second level on the four-tier warning system. High-speed rail services have been cancelled in parts of the south, local media report. Fears that Mangkhut may be classed as a super typhoon again when it reaches Hong Kong on Sunday have receded, though it is still forecast to be a strong storm. Residents have been preparing. Tape has been stuck to the windows, creating ominous X-shapes on the front of homes and offices, and some bamboo scaffolding also appears to have been taken down or secured as a precaution. Fishermen in China remove their boat to safety as the typhoon approaches Hong Kong residents buy tape to secure their windows People are being told to stay indoors. Antoine Li, a government official at an emergency centre in the village of Tai O on the western coast of Hong Kong's Lantau island, said residents must not underestimate the storm. ""This typhoon will be very dangerous as it will arrive when everyone is sleeping and there is no way to leave. So we have called on residents to leave the village before it gets dark,"" he told Reuters news agency. A shop owner in the village said: ""Everyone is scared of the typhoon this time, very scared"", and they are more worried about the elderly living in stilt houses, who insisted on staying.

"Joe Robinson was on holiday in Turkey when he was arrested by police A former soldier with the British army who fought for Kurdish forces against so-called Islamic State (IS) in Syria has been given a prison sentence in Turkey, his mother says. Joe Robinson, 25, from Leeds, was arrested while on holiday in 2017 and charged with terrorism offences. He was accused of being a member of the Kurdish armed group the YPG, which Turkey views as a terrorist group. Robinson was given a seven-and-a-half year sentence but remains on bail. He is planning an appeal against his conviction. His mother Sharon Chimejczuk said she had received a phone call on Friday night from an official at the British Foreign Office confirming his sentence. She said her son's fiancÃ©e, Mira Rojkan, a law student at the University of Leeds, had been given a suspended sentence for ""terrorism propaganda"". ""There was a trial, but Joe wasn't at it,"" Mrs Chimejczuk said. Ms Rojkan said: ""The court sentenced me for sharing Facebook posts with the Kurdish flag and links to Kurdish songs on YouTube. ""The situation is just so sad and ridiculous. ""It's beyond me how this can be happening."" Robinson spent five months fighting with Kurdish forces against IS in Syria Speaking to the BBC News Channel, Ms Rojkan, a Bulgarian national, said: ""Unfortunately for Joe, there was very little help from the Foreign Office. ""They are interested in the case and are following it, but didn't send any representatives and didn't help nearly as much as the Bulgarian foreign ministry."" Robinson, who is originally from Lancashire and previously served with British forces in Afghanistan, spent four months in a Turkish jail after his arrest last year. He was released on bail in November but has been prevented from leaving the country. He spent five months as a volunteer with Kurdish forces who were fighting against IS, and had previously spoken about his experiences in media reports. His family say he was a military medic. The YPG is regarded as a terrorist organisation by Turkey but is not a banned group in the UK. A Foreign Office spokesperson said: ""We have been following this case very closely and have raised it with the Turkish authorities. We stand ready to provide further consular assistance.""

Your stories: Breastfeeding toddlers Mother-of-two Ms Garcia, who is from Argentina, gave birth to her son Anton in June. The device she wore, called the Elvie pump, connects to a smartphone app and allows mothers to express milk underneath their bras. Mara Martin modelled at the Sports Illustrated show in July In July, model Mara Martin walked down the catwalk at the Sports Illustratedswimsuit show in a gold bikini while breastfeeding her daughter Aria, who was five months old at the time. Many social media users praised the model as ""inspiring"", but some accused her of attention seeking. At the time, Ms Martin, who was chosen in an open casting, wrote on Instagram: ""I can't believe I am waking up to headlines with me and my daughter in them for doing something I do every day."" In July, American model Chrissy Teigen posted a picture ofher breastfeeding one of her children, and mock-feeding their baby doll, on Instagram. Chrissy Teigen has used her Instagram account to challenge some people's views on public breastfeeding Breastfeeding campaigners said they were grateful to Chrissy for sharing her photo but not all the reaction was positive.

"This video can not be played Watch the Delta II rocket launch from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California The American space agency has launched a laser into orbit to measure the condition of Earth's ice cover. The satellite mission, called ICESat-2, should provide more precise information on how these frozen surfaces are being affected by global warming. Antarctica, Greenland and the ice floating on the Arctic Ocean have all lost volume in recent decades. ICESat-2 will track ongoing change in unprecedented detail from its vantage point some 500km above the planet. The satellite was taken up by a Delta II rocket, flying out of Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. Robots ahoy! Mapping Earth's surface Wind mapping satellite lifts off Biggest ever Antarctic field campaign As the name suggests, ICESat-2 is a follow-on project. The original spacecraft flew in the 2000s and pioneered the laser measurement of the height of polar glaciers and sea-ice from space. But the mission was plagued by technical problems that limited its observations to just a couple of months in every year. Nasa has since re-modelled the technology, both to make it more reliable and to give it a sharper view. ""ICESat-2 is going to observe the cryosphere with a spatial resolution at the level we have never seen before from space,"" explained Prof Helen Fricker from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. ""The beam is split across-track into six - three pairs - so we can map more of the ice surface as well as estimating the surface slope, which can confuse our interpretation of height changes. ""The orbit reaches to two degrees of the poles, and the same ground tracks are sampled every three months, giving us seasonal snapshots of ice height. From these data we can unravel the processes responsible for the ice loss in the polar regions,"" she told BBC News. Artwork: ICESat-2 fires 10,000 shots a second as it moves around the Earth Antarctica and Greenland lose billions of tonnes of ice every year - the result largely of warm water being able to melt land glaciers where they meet the ocean. This wastage is slowly but surely pushing up sea-levels worldwide. In the Arctic, the seasonal floes have also been in retreat. Sea-ice in the far north is thought to have lost two-thirds of its volume since the 1980s. And although this has no direct impact on the height of the oceans, the reduced ice-cover is working to amplify temperature rises in the region. Much of the change that is occurring at the poles can present itself in quite subtle ways, says Dr Tom Neumann, Nasa's ICESat-2 deputy project scientist, and a very precise tool is needed to characterise it properly. ""An elevation change of just a centimetre over an ice sheet the scale of Antarctica represents a tremendous amount of water either gained to or lost by the ice sheet. 140 gigatonnes worth."" Mission launches to weigh Earth's water This video can not be played Tom Neumann: ""IceSAT-2's laser is a totally different design"" Weighing half a tonne, the new laser system is one of the largest Earth-observation instruments ever built by Nasa. It uses a technique called ""photon counting"". It fires about 10,000 pulses of light every second. Each of those shots goes down to the Earth and bounces back up on a timescale of about 3.3 milliseconds. The exact time equates to the height of the reflecting surface. ""We fire about a trillion photons (particles of light) in every shot. We get about one back,"" says Cathy Richardson, who works on the team at Nasa that developed the instrument. ""We can time that one photon when it comes back just as accurately as when it left the instrument. And from that we can calculate a distance to about half a centimetre on the Earth."" The laser is making a measurement every 70cm as it moves forward across the ice. The $1bn mission is funded initially to run for three years It is hoped that ICESat-2 can help produce the first robust maps of sea-ice thickness in the Antarctic. At the moment, the technique for assessing ice floes really only works in the Arctic. It involves comparing the height of that part of the floating ice sticking above the water with the height of the ocean surface itself. Because scientists know the density of seawater and ice, they can then calculate how much ice must be submerged, and thus a total overall thickness. In the Antarctic, though, this approach is problematic. In the far south, the ice floes can get covered in substantial dumps of snow. This will sometimes push the sea-ice fully under the water and confound the thickness calculation. The proposed solution is to combine ICESat's laser observations, which reflect off the top of the snow surface, with those of radar satellites, whose microwave beams penetrate more deeply into the snow covering. This will reduce a lot of uncertainty. Scientists need  thickness measurements to properly access the status of floes. Sometimes the wind will spread the ice out; other times it will pile the ice up. The difference is only apparent when the ice is viewed in three dimensions. And, no, the laser does not have the power to melt the ice from 500km up! But on a dark night you might just be able to see a green dot when ICESat flies overhead.

"This video can not be played Flash floods and landslides have led to fatalities in the Philippines Some 14 people have been killed in a massive storm which brought destruction to the northern Philippines, a presidential adviser says. Typhoon Mangkhut ripped through the Philippines' main island of Luzon, and is now moving west towards China. The storm tore off roofs, felled trees, triggered 42 landslides and caused extensive flooding. Mangkhut unleashed winds of 185km/h (115mph) as it careered from east to west across the north of Luzon. Five million people were in its path, and thousands were evacuated. Almost all buildings in the city of Tuguegarao - the capital city of the north-eastern Cagayan province - sustained some damage, a government official said, and communications were down in places. Francis Tolentino, a political adviser to President Rodrigo Duterte, said up to 14 people were killed as a result of the storm. Two rescuers died trying to help people trapped in a landslide. Unverified reports say the body of a young girl was found in the Marikina river, which flows through Manila. Residents of Gonzaga province after a night in an evacuation centre The mayor of the Baguio City said five people were killed there. Mauricio Domogan told CNN Philippines a similar number were also missing and the sewerage system was being overwhelmed by the floodwaters. The evacuation centre in the coastal town of Aparri is said to have been destroyed and phone networks are down. BBC correspondent Jonathan Head, who is in Luzon, saw 200 people who had taken shelter in one school being re-evacuated because a dyke holding back a swollen river was about to burst. The full cost of Typhoon Mangkhut on one of the country's most important food-producing regions cannot yet be assessed, he says. The typhoon recalls memories of the deadliest storm on record in the Philippines - Super Typhoon Haiyan in 2013 - which killed more than 7,000. However, preparation and evacuation procedures have been improved since then. In pictures: Typhoon lashes Philippines Lawyer in Tuguegarao: Some are in a daze How to survive a monster storm Hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones: What's the difference? The typhoon made landfall at Baggao, in the north-east of the Philippines, at about 01:40 local time on Saturday (17:40 GMT on Friday), and left the country some 20 hours later. After losing some of its wind speed over land as it headed west, the storm was downgraded from a super typhoon. It is forecast to weaken slightly as it approaches China from the south-east. The storm - known locally as Ompong - has a cloud diameter of about 900km and is heading west at about 30km/h. The World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) billed the storm asthe strongest tropical cyclone the world has faced so far this year,external. Some residents of Aparri were still able to amuse themselves Inhabitants of Alcala inspected damage The typhoon is forecast to pass near Hong Kong on Sunday afternoon. In nearby Macau, shops have been boarded up and residents have been sticking tape on their windows. The typhoon is expected to weaken into a tropical depression by Tuesday. Authorities in the Philippines have said they were better prepared for the storm than in previous years. Warnings were issued in dozens of provinces. Travel by sea and air was restricted. Flights were cancelled, schools shut and the army was on standby.

Reality Check: Are hurricanes getting worse? ""We are really frightened,"" Delaila Pasion, who had fled her home, told AFP news agency. ""They say it is so strong, we were too scared to remain."" ""During previous monsoon rains, half of our house was destroyed so I wanted to take my grandchildren to safety,"" she told journalists. The Philippines is routinely hit during the typhoon season. In China, where the storm is predicted to hit late on Sunday or early on Monday, the authorities have raised storm alerts to ""yellow"", which is the second level on the four-tier warning system. High-speed rail services have been cancelled in parts of the south, local media report. Fears that Mangkhut may be classed as a super typhoon again when it reaches Hong Kong on Sunday have receded, though it is still forecast to be a strong storm. Residents have been preparing. Tape has been stuck to the windows, creating ominous X-shapes on the front of homes and offices, and some bamboo scaffolding also appears to have been taken down or secured as a precaution. Fishermen in China remove their boat to safety as the typhoon approaches Hong Kong residents buy tape to secure their windows People are being told to stay indoors. Antoine Li, a government official at an emergency centre in the village of Tai O on the western coast of Hong Kong's Lantau island, said residents must not underestimate the storm. ""This typhoon will be very dangerous as it will arrive when everyone is sleeping and there is no way to leave. So we have called on residents to leave the village before it gets dark,"" he told Reuters news agency. A shop owner in the village said: ""Everyone is scared of the typhoon this time, very scared"", and they are more worried about the elderly living in stilt houses, who insisted on staying.

A guide to the world's deadliest storms  Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters.Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face.""Florida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017)  The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms.This eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it.

"Halogen light bulbs have been banned due to their inefficiency Household items, along with most things in life, have trends that come and go. Very few of us continue to scour our front step with a donkey stone; alarm clocks, paper maps, camcorders - and the recently-banned halogen bulb - could soon be just as irrelevant. Professor of design history at the University of Portsmouth, Deborah Sugg Ryan, who was also the series consultant and on-screen expert for the BBC television seriesA House Through Time, has identified 50 products likely to pass from the category of useful and even luxurious to that of pointless and old-fashioned. But should the bedroom tea-maker, the carpet sweeper and the hostess trolley be consigned to the dustbin of history? Advances in technology do not always go hand-in-hand with enjoying life. For every person who is waiting for the time it will be normal for a beverage-bearing robot to glide into the bedroom at daybreak, there are plenty who are still waking up to the comforting steamy burble and gush of a Teasmade. So before they disappear from the country's shelves and shopping lists, here are some of the once-ubiquitous household products that are arguably due a comeback. What couldn't it do? The Goblin Teasmade (de luxe model 1966) ""makes the tea, lights the lamp, wakes you up and tells the time"" - and all for the bargain price of Â£21, 18s 11d. Allowing for inflation, it would now set you back Â£386 The classic Goblin Teasmade is probably the best-known of these little gems that cater for our obsession with a nice cup of char before emerging from beneath the eiderdown. The original gas-powered automatic tea-making apparatus was patented by Samuel Rowbottom in 1891. It included an analogue alarm clock, which triggered the mechanism to boil the water, using the steam to force the water down a tube into a teapot. Electric versions became available in the 1930s, with some including a lamp. By the 1970s the Teasmade had reached iconic status - at one point it was estimated that two million British households had one. Admittedly, most of us now own electric kettles and do not need to tiptoe downstairs in the cold and dark to light the kitchen range before waiting for our water to boil, but nothing compares to having a piping hot brew ready at the bedside. Teasmade models from 1945 and 1935 Coughs, colds and old-fashioned curatives Concorde stories: Remembering the 'pocket rocket' The 1980s cars being targeted by thieves Gentlemen need never worry about where to keep their plain, dress or fancy shirts For the gentleman who believes there's a place for everything and everything should be in its place, the Compactum wardrobe was the perfect clothes repository. On the outside, a respectable and occasionally stylish veneer. But the wonders on the inside! A vast array of fitted drawers, slides, pigeon holes, hangers and hinged compartments. Each compartment was clearly labelled - so gloves, studs, socks, collars, underwear, plain shirts, dress shirts, ""fancy shirts"", handkerchiefs, pyjamas and so on would be easily at hand, and there was no mistake over where to put things away. With an inside-door mirror and a shelf to keep one's brush and comb, it was convenient and space-saving. Another Easiwork product, the ""cream gun"", allowed housewives to combine milk and butter to make a form of ""pure fresh cream"" Fitted kitchens took a long time to catch on in Britain and were not commonly found in most homes until the early 1960s. Before persuading customers to invest in the luxury of a built-in kitchen, companies like Peerless of Perivale sold a kitchen cabinet in the form of a single free-standing cupboard with multiple doors and drawers. These dressers were popular by the 1920s, and usually incorporated a flour sifter, flour bin, sugar bin, metal-lined bread drawer, rolling pin, ""household wants"" indicator and storage jars. There was a sliding or fold-down enamel worktop for food preparation and a meat safe. Some larger ones even included built-in ironing boards. Prof Sugg Ryan suggests this ""kitchen in a cupboard"" could be due a revival in contemporary compact urban kitchens. The advent of fitted kitchens led to the demise of the Easiwork dresser A man enjoys a meal served from a hostess trolley in a demonstration at the Ideal Home Show of 1947 The hostess trolley - a favourite with 1970s housewives - was a lumbering pantechnicon used to keep food more-or-less warm in Pyrex dishes. It meant a Sunday roast dinner, for example, could be prepared first thing in the morning and then forgotten about, freeing up the modern woman to do what modern women did. Go to church or iron their peasant blouses and bell bottoms, or whatever. But microwaves, ready meals, and less formal eating arrangements meant households became less likely to invest in the hostess trolley. In 1964, a Hawkins Electric Hostess for Gracious Living cost 36 guineas - the equivalent of about Â£650 today. But there remains a role for the hostess trolley in modern society - back in 2002 it was certified as suitable for use by the Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America, who are forbidden to do any kind of work - including cooking - on the Sabbath. And the need to keep food warm during Ramadan has made the trolley popular in the Middle East. Shops like John Lewis and Argos still sell hostess trolleys - brushed-steel and beech-effect trolleys add a more contemporary edge to the design, which is less reminiscent of dreary boarding-houses by the sea. There has even been a limited edition union jack hostess trolley for Harrods. Carpet sweepers did not always come with a free baby One of the most popular non-electrical labour-saving devices was the mechanical carpet sweeper, which first went on sale in Britain in 1889. It was a small box with rollers and brushes on the base, connected by a belt or gears. The 1935 Housewife's Book said: ""These handy little labour-savers should be used for a few minutes after every meal or wherever crumbs or litter make an appearance"". Prof Sugg Ryan points out their environmental credentials as a zero-energy appliance and suggests they should be due for a revival. Sweeper-manufacturer Bissell is still in business, although their advertising is now not centred around ""Christmas presents for her"". What more could a woman want?

"Alan Pegler fell in love with the locomotive at the age of four Just over half a century ago, the world's best-loved steam engine was destined for scrap. That it was saved was down to the efforts of one man - a true British eccentric. But his love for the locomotive he called the ""old girl"" cost him his fortune - and nearly saw Flying Scotsman stranded in the United States. Alan Pegler was four when he was taken by his parents to the British Empire Exhibition of 1924. As he walked through pavilions full of exhibits, one left the young boy dazzled: LNER 4472 Flying Scotsman. ""I was lifted into its cab,"" he said in an interview with the Railway Magazine. ""I remember being impressed at how clean it was, compared with the grimier engines we saw at home, and how marvellous its apple-green paint was. ""I was spellbound and couldn't stop thinking about it all the way home."" In 1963, the advent of diesel meant Flying Scotsman looked destined for the scrapyard Pegler's infatuation with the first British steam locomotive to break the 100mph barrier and run non-stop from London to Edinburgh would become a lifelong love. Forty years after this encounter, he became instrumental in saving it from the scrapyard. His daughter Penny Vaudoyer can remember the day, in January 1963, when her father came into her room to tell her he had bought the engine. ""He had a little sparkle about him,"" she said. ""He sat down on my bed and said, 'I've bought a steam engine. I'm going to have her painted apple-green [again] and we are going to have so many wonderful adventures with her'."" Penny Vaudoyer can remember her father having ""a little sparkle"" about him when he bought the engine Pegler was an eccentric raconteur. Born into a family of manufacturers in Retford, Nottinghamshire, he spent his childhood playing at being a porter at his local station at Barnby Moor, watching the trains go by on the Great Northern mainline. Aged 17, he gained his pilot's licence and spent his time flying over the line, chasing steam locomotives. Such experience saw him posted into the Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm during World War Two. He later became a dive-bomber and survived a horrific crash landing when his engine cut out. ""He was a swashbuckling buccaneer of a character,"" said Andy Roden, editor of Steam World and author of a book about Flying Scotsman. ""He was just going to do what he wanted and, thankfully for us steam buffs, that mostly involved the railways."" ""Like many of that generation, his character was shaped by World War Two,"" added Bob Gwynne, associate curator at the National Railway Museum. ""After he'd been through that, there was nothing he couldn't bounce back from."" Pegler found himself a very wealthy young man After the death of Pegler's father in 1957, there was a feeling among his relatives that he was becoming too diverted by his rail ""hobby"" to take on the family business. By that stage, he had a seat on British Railways' Eastern Area board and had reopeneda narrow-gauge line in Wales: the Ffestiniog, in Gwynedd. ""The family got fed up with him being more interested in railways than the business and bought him out for Â£70,000,"" said Mr Roden. ""It was a huge amount of money at that time and it was burning a hole in his pocket. Most of us would think, 'Let's retire and live the life of Riley'."" Dr Richard Beeching was infuriated by Pegler's publicity campaign for Flying Scotsman Instead, Pegler became swept up in a debate that was engulfing Britain - the future of steam railways. British Railways (BR), the nationalised body that had taken over Britain's ailing post-war rail network, was determined to replace steam with diesel. Its chairman Dr Richard Beeching believed the move would save money and, as a result, thousands of steam engines were culled. In response to the outcry, BR decided to preserve a few locomotives. However, Flying Scotsman was not among them. Pegler negotiated a ""fantastic deal"" when he bought the locomotive BR seemed to feel only a few engines per designer could be preserved. Instead of Flying Scotsman, the board chose to save the record-breaking Mallard which was also the work of influential railway engineer Sir Nigel Gresley. ""BR had already saved Nigel Gresley's best design, which was Mallard,"" said Mr Gwynne. ""They didn't need another one. ""Flying Scotsman would certainly have been scrapped. Her future looked bleak."" When Pegler found out Flying Scotsman wasn't going to be saved for the nation, he was aghast. ""He felt its destruction would be a huge loss,"" said Mr Roden. ""Pegler decided on the spot to buy it for Â£3,000 and negotiated for himself a fantastic deal."" The Great Pretender: England on film The engineering giant with 'short man syndrome' How smallpox claimed its final victim As well as ensuring the engine got a complete overhaul and its own shed, Pegler was able to charter trains for Flying Scotsman. By 1968 it had become, Mr Roden says, the only steam locomotive running on Britain's railways. ""He saved a national icon at a time when the nation didn't actually want to save her,"" he said. This video can not be played The day Blue Peter's John Noakes rode Flying Scotsman Pegler ran Flying Scotsman very successfully at first. ""He was a master at publicity,"" said Mr Gwynne. ""He paid for the services of a London-based PR firm and over the next few years Flying Scotsman became the most famous locomotive in the world."" Thousands turned out to see the engine everywhere it went. It appeared on BBC children's programme Blue Peter, with presenter John Noakes shovelling coal in the cab. ""A lot of change was going on and people were nostalgic for the past. And the media love eccentrics, especially rich ones,"" said Mr Gwynne. ""Pegler played on that very well and he had the time of his life."" The publicity campaign ensured the engine attracted worldwide attention In 1968, in a stroke of genius,Pegler managed to recreate the engine's famous non-stop 1928 trip from London to Edinburgh. ""The BBC hired a helicopter to cover it,"" said Mr Roden. ""The significance was that it was the last time steam was going to be able to do that. ""It was a remarkable swansong and Pegler was in the cab, in the buffet car, all over the place."" But all the fuss about Flying Scotsman would bring Pegler into confrontation with Dr Beeching. ""The poor man was trying to modernise the railway and there was this steam engine getting all the headlines,"" said Mr Gwynne. ""Beeching was not very happy."" Pegler was sacked from the BR board. ""There's a story that he asked Beeching whether he was being dropped because of Flying Scotsman,"" said Mr Roden. ""Beeching sat back in his chair and looked Pegler straight in the eye. After a pause, he said, 'Yes'."" In the late 1960s, the ""old girl"" went on a tour of the United States Undeterred, Pegler set his sights on the United States, where he led a promotional tour in 1969 in conjunction with the British government. At first, it was a resounding success. ""Amazingly, at the time of the space race and the moon landings, there was a nostalgia for the past,"" said Mr Roden. ""The Americans came to love Flying Scotsman almost as much as we do. ""There was an elegance and a romance associated with her and her name that sums up exactly what she's about."" Eventually, the government decided to call time on the tour. For Pegler, the urge to soldier on alone proved irresistible. ""A chap said to him, 'it's your goddamn locomotive - why don't you drive it?"" said Mr Roden. ""That was something you could do in the US, and Pegler, being the character he was, did. He thought it might result in him going bankrupt. But it was a once-in-a-lifetime chance."" Despite his initial success, Pegler ended up penniless in San Francisco The consequences of his decision to carry on with the tour proved disastrous. His daughter, who was 17 at the time, remembers travelling on the cash-strapped second tour. ""It was an almost unbelievable journey,"" Mrs Vaudoyer said. ""We crossed the Rockies and went from Montreal, all the way to San Francisco through all this wonderful landscape. Even in the small towns we had big welcomes. ""I could tell things were getting difficult for my father though. By the end of the trip, we weren't staying in nice hotels any more - we were sleeping in sleeping bags in the carriage. But it was still great fun."" Pegler would end up filing for bankruptcy in the UK. ""Financially, he lost it,"" said Mr Roden. ""The tour became like a travelling circus. Business dried up and Pegler ran out of money. ""He sat on his suitcase on Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco and thought, 'what on earth am I going to do next?'"" For his beloved engine, the future seemed equally bleak. Flying Scotsman was parked in an army base in California. There was great national anxiety she would never return to British shores. Crowds remain captivated by the famous green engine But both Pegler and his ""old girl"" proved equally indefatigable. William McAlpine, another wealthy businessman with a passion for railways, stepped in to buy the locomotive and bring her home. ""It was absolutely mobbed when it came back. She had acquired superstar status,"" said Mr Gwynne. As for Pegler, who married four times, he became a shipboard entertainer and worked his passage back to the UK. ""I would sing my heart out,"" he told the Railway Magazine. ""The drinkers would pass round the hat and I would have enough for a meal the next day."" Despite the loss of his fortune, Alan Pegler bounced back Back home in Britain, he embarked on a career as an entertainer and actor, including a spell as a Henry VIII impersonator at a restaurant in London - his mutton chop whiskers and extrovert personality proving perfect for the job description. Today Flying Scotsman sits in the National Railway collection, having been bought in 2004. As for Pegler, who died in 2012, he always remained in love with the engine that ruined him financially. ""My father's passion for 'the old girl' lasted all his life, right up until he died,"" recalled his daughter. ""He always travelled behind her whenever he had the opportunity. She was part of the family."" But many feel he deserves to be better remembered for his achievement in preserving a national icon. Today Flying Scotsman is safely preserved in the national collection ""His finest hour was saving Flying Scotsman,"" said Mr Roden. ""He is one of the catalysts of the railway preservation movement. If you had said 50 years ago that steam locomotives would still be being built and lines reopened, people wouldn't have believed you. ""The starting point for all that goes back to people like Alan Pegler.""

"Spain has now seen five years of economic growth, but still has the eurozone's second-highest unemployment rate after Greece Ten years on from the crisis in the depths of the American banking system that triggered a global economic shock the real question is this - should we be looking back towards the last catastrophe or counting down to the next one? In Spain where both the physical and financial landscape were altered by the aftershocks that followed the collapse of the Lehman Brothers bank it is possible to find two great cliches of economic journalism side-by-side. There are green shoots of recovery on the ground - but there are certainly storm clouds on the horizon too. Headlines from Spain after the economic crisis were often illustrated by pictures of empty apartment blocks in the deserted streets of ghost towns - communities built with borrowed money which were abandoned when developers went bust, banks stopped lending and families stopped buying. There are still plenty to be found but in the municipality of Valdeluz, a short drive from Madrid, we found something more interesting. A ghost town which is showing signs of coming to life. Valdeluz in 2012, when most apartment blocks were empty The local mayor Miguel Coceras is in no doubt that he is transforming his town from a ""municipio de fantasma"" into what he calls a ""municipio estrella"" - a star city. Certainly if personal energy could be converted into electricity generation Miguel would produce enough in the course of a short meeting to power the whole town. ""We are only a local government, so how does a local government face a global crisis?"" he asks. ""The answer is to focus on the person beside you, the person living near you."" Miguel is a socialist and so for him part of the answer to the crisis was to use public spending to help prime the pump of the local economy - although he points out that it's not only socialists who believe in public sector investment, pointing to stimulus-spending in the United States to make his case. ""If you decided to invest to give your citizens more education, culture and sports you're going to give them a better quality of life, and this is what we decided,"" he explains. Realistically the mechanisms of market economics did their bit too, lowering property prices to make them more attractive. Mayor Miguel Coceras says part of the answer has been to use public money to boost the local economy But Miguel sees Valdeluz as a success story for government action and argues that where two years ago 90% of the town's apartments were empty, today 90% are full. The problem for Spain is that success hasn't really been repeated on a national scale even as the country has grown out of crisis. The financial crisis: A lost decade How the crisis accelerated the rise of China Who was to blame for the financial crisis? On the drive back from Valdeluz to Madrid you can find a desolate stretch of unfinished motorway called MP-203. The surface of the highway was laid, although the lanes were never marked and electrical cables hang down from the roof of a partly-completed toll booth. It was designed to relieve pressure on the existing motorway system - the kind of road project that governments undertake when an economy is booming or when money is being borrowed to boost public spending. It doesn't look as though there are any plans to finish it now - to walk along the deserted fast lane is to feel like an archaeologist of the financial crash. And there are plenty of other signs too that Spain's recovery has a long way to go. The unfinished MP-203 motorway remains a sign that Spain's recovery is not yet complete In a suburb of Madrid we went to a meeting of Plataforma de Afectados por la Hipoteca, an organisation that campaigns to stop banks foreclosing on properties where families can't keep up their mortgage payments. Some of the rhetoric from the activists offers a familiar left-wing analysis of the crisis. ""Don't you know that banks don't pay tax and rich people don't pay tax?"" one of them asks me, but others see the issue of repossession as clear evidence that it's simply too early to say that financial crisis is over. When I ask one woman, Carmen Aguilera, if this is evidence that poor Spanish people are paying the price for mistakes made by wealthy American bankers she replies: ""Nothing has changed, and the banks haven't changed."" But even if you don't take the view that the crisis of 2008 is still going on, it's still possible to be very worried that it could repeat itself. Banks which were deemed ""too big to fail"" are bigger than ever by some measures and in many economies private debt has ballooned to alarming levels. Prof Carlos Rodriguez Braun is an historian of economic thought who laughs out loud when he's asked if he's a pessimist. ""We have a saying in Spanish, 'a pessimist is a well-informed optimist',"" he explains. Prof Carlos Rodriguez Braun says there will be another financial crisis, it's just a matter of time He is gently dismissive of the Valdeluz model that increased public spending in itself is the answer - if using public money to raise demand was the answer, he points out, there'd never be any economic crises. Prof Braun goes on to explain that one of the key policy tools used to combat the crisis has been quantitative easing - a way for central banks to pump money into the financial system - and that in spite of its fancy new name it is a variation on tools which have been used in the past. Overall it's clear that he is something of a pessimist. He agrees it's a question of ""when"" rather than ""if"" there's another financial crisis, adding simply: ""Unluckily I don't know where or when. But if you have the same system and recipes you had in 2007 why would you be sure that you're not heading for a new crisis?"" Not everyone of course is a pessimist, if only because such unanimity would require a degree of agreement amongst economists, but from Prof Braun it certainly feels compelling. And it might help to explain why no-one is rushing to finish the work on Motorway MP-203.

"In Chile, more than 100 Catholic clergy are being investigated over alleged sex crimes and attempts to cover them up. It's a scandal that haunts the reign of Pope Francis and has tipped the Chilean church into crisis. But it began decades ago with one man - Father Fernando Karadima, a parish priest in Santiago, who became Chile's most notorious sexual predator. ""He offered you the vision of being called by the Lord. He showed you a very wonderful world,"" remembers Dr James Hamilton, a gastric surgeon now in his 50s. ""He always told us he had a special gift - a kind of miracle gift - that he could see in every young person, if they had been called by God. He was almost a kind of saint."" Father Fernando Karadima offered the adolescent James Hamilton refuge in the early 1980s. Chile had been under the dictatorship of Gen Augusto Pinochet for a decade. And in those troubled years of killings and disappearances, the church community created by this charismatic priest in the upmarket Santiago parish of El Bosque provided welcome reassurance. ""For a young person, it was like the bee and the honey - it was sweet in a world of difficulties, when you were struggling with your family,"" says James Hamilton. James Hamilton as a young man His father had left the family home, so here was a teenager who was vulnerable - easy prey for a practised abuser. And, as a young idealist, he believed he had only two choices: ""Join the people fighting against Pinochet, mostly through violence. Or, follow the road the Catholic Church showed you - the ways of the saints, of peace and to become the voice of Jesus. I wanted to study medicine, so my way was non-violence."" But although the Catholic Church would be instrumental in supporting victims of the dictatorship, some priests believed Pinochet was Chile's saviour - Karadima was one of them. James Hamilton was invited to join Catholic Action, an exclusive youth group that met in El Bosque to listen to Karadima talk about heroism, the saints and the need to be humble and obedient. This impressionable teenager felt special, as though he had been chosen. Then the sexual abuse began. ""You didn't expect it - it was something absolutely confusing. It couldn't be possible that this saintly man could be doing all this because of his sexual perversion. It couldn't be possible,"" says Hamilton, remembering his bewilderment. ""Obviously the one that was wrong was meâ¦"" James Hamilton in 2018 And Karadima, wielding a toxic pseudo-spirituality, did not disabuse James Hamilton of these powerful feelings of guilt. ""Something that is very terrible, is that every time he abused me he sent me to another priest to confess,"" remembers Hamilton. ""So he drove all the guilt to me. And this other priest who knew everything, he always stayed silent when I confessed about Karadima. He just told me, 'Be patient, don't worry.'"" At the church in El Bosque, Karadima was well protected by those around him. He bewitched his acolytes, and trained dozens of young men for the priesthood - four of his proteges would become bishops. The Church of the Sacred Heart in the parish of El Bosque Karadima's hold over James Hamilton - and the abuse - continued for two decades. It didn't stop even after the doctor married and had children. Now that he has spent 14 years in psychotherapy, three times a week, he understands the dynamics of this abusive relationship very well. But as a young man he felt compelled to comply with his abuser. When he went for dinner at El Bosque with his wife, Karadima would ask him to leave the table and accompany him upstairs on the pretext of a medical complaint that needed attention. ""Many times I tried to distance myself from Karadima, but every time I tried he made a kind of trial with two or three bishops and three or four priests. They put me in a room, and told me the devil was inside me."" This was what was known as ""fraternal correction"" at El Bosque - a powerful mechanism citing possession by the devil, and used to bring disobedient members of Karadima's flock back into the fold. Listen toChile - Sexual Abuse, Secrets and Lies, on BBC World Service on Thursday 13 September at 13:30 Orlisten via the BBC iPlayer In 2004, James Hamilton finally broke from Karadima. ""I felt my kids were in danger.  Especially my boy,"" he says. Karadima pursued the doctor, sending priests and bishops to speak to his family and employer. James Hamilton reported Karadima to church authorities, and although he did not know it at the time, he was the second man in two years to make a complaint of sexual abuse against the El Bosque priest. But there was a deafening silence from the Catholic Church. There would be no formal investigation for years, until the evidence against Karadima became overwhelming. Fernando Karadima inside the Supreme Court building in Santiago By 2009, James Hamilton's marriage had broken down and he sought an annulment. In the application he cited sexual abuse by Karadima, and the hold the priest had over him at the time of his marriage, as the reason. The Church put pressure on him - he was visited by clergy requesting him to stop pursuing the annulment. ""They asked me to sign a declaration - it said that I was not a minor when I met Karadima, and that this was a relationship between two men."" He refused.  ""I couldn't sign it because it wasn't true,"" he says. He got the annulment. It was when details of the annulment were leaked that the Catholic Church had to investigate Fernando Karadima. By then, James Hamilton had made contact with other survivors of Karadima's abuse.  In 2010, the men made declarations to a civil prosecutor. They knew the priest would not go to jail because of Chile's Statute of Limitations, but they did not want to be part of a cover-up.  It was scary. ""Our names were in the press - we were [seen as] the worst. I thought that someone would try and murder me - put a bomb under my car or, my brakes would be cut in a descent from the mountains. This kind of thing happened in Chile under Pinochet's dictatorship.  And Karadima was a Pinochet guy - he was friends with all Pinochet's former generals. He had big power - until today."" Today Fernando Karadima is 88. He lives in a convent set in extensive gardens located in an up-market district of Santiago. In 2011 the Vatican found him guilty of sexually abusing minors, sometimes by force. He was sentenced to a life of penance and prayer, and forbidden from having contact with former parishioners, or from performing any public act of ministry. So why did it take so long? What stopped the then-Archbishop of Santiago, Cardinal Francisco Javier Errazuriz, from initiating an ecclesiastical investigation into Karadima's behaviour after he received the first report of abuse at least seven years previously? ""Unfortunately, I judged that the accusations weren't credible at the time,"" he told the media in 2010. The Karadima case shocked Chile. Resentment against the Catholic Church simmered until 2015. Then, when Pope Francis appointed one of the disgraced priest's acolytes, Juan Barros, as bishop - a man who had allegedly protected Karadima - Chileans were furious. Protesters greeted the Pope when he visited Chile in January 2018, and the pontiff's dismissal of allegations against Bishop Barros as ""slander"" provoked enormous indignation. After he left Santiago, Pope Francis was forced to respond to his critics, and sent two envoys to Chile to investigate sex crime. Bishop Juan Barros leads a Palm Sunday mass in March 2018 The staggering story that has emerged since has provoked a deep crisis in the Catholic Church. The Vatican's envoys produced a 2,300-page report, and the Pope acknowledged a, ""culture of abuse"" in Chile. Five bishops have resigned - including Juan Barros. Meanwhile, in a first for Chile, civil prosecutors have seized church documents in a series of high-profile raids. The civil authorities in Chile are investigating 119 cases of sexual abuse and their concealment by the church. Of the 178 victims so far identified, nearly half were minors at the time of the alleged offences. The Archbishop of Santiago, Cardinal Ricardo Ezzati, has been called by prosecutors to testify. Although the investigation has moved beyond Fernando Karadima and his faithful coterie, the commitment of Chile's lay authorities to securing justice for victims of clerical sexual abuse has emboldened more of Karadima's victims to come forward. Last month, Father Francisco Javier Ossa Figueroa spent two hours giving his testimony to prosecutors about what happened to him in El Bosque from the late 1980s onwards. Father Francisco Javier Ossa Figueroa was also a victim of Karadima ""It was tough to dig it all up, but I know it could help a lot of people. You do need to be brave, because it wasn't just me as a priest who went to testify - it was me, Francisco, the person who was personally hurt by this.  But I feel as though a weight has been lifted from me, and that I'm not alone."" In the wake of this year's explosive revelations about the Catholic Church in Chile, Father Francisco was called to meet the Pope in Rome to discuss his experience of abuse. James Hamilton too was invited to the Vatican, together with the two men who had also contributed to bringing down Fernando Karadima in 2011 - Jose Andres Murillo and Juan Carlos Cruz. Pope Francis has admitted he made, ""grave errors"" in his judgement of events in Chile, but James Hamilton is not impressed. Chilean sexual abuse victims Jose Andres Murillo (R), James Hamilton (C) and Juan Carlos Cruz (L), at a news conference in Rome ""The Pope told us nothing. He didn't tell us anything about what he would do, he just asked us to pray for him."" Dr Hamilton's years of therapy have helped him recover from his ordeal, but this experienced surgeon says he sacrificed a great deal by going public with his allegations. As a result, he is no longer a university professor, or chief of surgery. What he wants is for the Catholic Church to name and shame - for the powerful men still in Chile's Catholic hierarchy to take responsibility for what they did. ""They almost murdered my heart, my soulâ¦ When you kill the soul - and I can tell you this as a physician - you begin to kill the body. Children who were abused will live 20 years less, so what are we talking about? They are criminals.""

"Sally Hunter joined an online dating service after deciding ""life couldn't get worse"" and met her future husband, Mark How would you cope if an international financial crisis turned your life upside down? Could you handle a drop in income or losing your home? Or would you rise to the challenge and change your life for the better? Life was never the same for millions of people after thecollapse of US investment bank Lehman Brothersin September 2008. Ten years on, we asked two women in the UK how their lives had changed. This is the story of two Sallys. Sally from Birmingham lost her job as an events manager and had to do a combination of bar and temporary work in order to survive. Sally from Essex had to make people redundant at her company and ended up moving back home with her mother as she turned 45. Sally Hunter, from Birmingham, had just started a new job as an events manager for a law firm at the time the crash happened. ""Within two months, they were making redundancies as their major business was construction,"" she told the BBC. Sally survived two rounds of job cuts but in January 2010 was made redundant. ""I was devastated,"" she said. ""I had barely built up any long service, so my payment was minimal. ""My confidence was also shattered - although I understood the market conditions, I couldn't help but feel like it was my fault."" Sally Hunter in New York in 2008 Furthermore, Sally had bought a house in September 2007, just before the housing market began to crash - and her house immediately lost 25% of its value. To make matters worse, Sally was on a fixed-rate mortgage, which in 2007 had seemed like the safest option. ""If I'd gone on a tracker, my payments would have dropped by Â£200 a month,"" she said. Scared about what would happen to her financially, Sally found a temporary job as well as a bar job, working up to 70 hours a week to try to cover her bills. ""I ate a lot of rice during this time and didn't spend money on anything that wasn't food or bills,"" she said. ""Ironically, I've never saved so much."" Within three months, however, Sally had found a permanent job, for which she considered herself ""incredibly lucky"". It was again as an events manager - but this time she was earning much more money. ""Also, deciding that life couldn't get much worse, I joined an online dating service for a weekend, and ended up meeting my husband, Mark, who is a risk and data manager."" The couple have been married for six years and have a three-year-old son, Barnaby. But Sally is mindful that life could have turned out very differently for her. ""I know others who really had a rough time for a number of years, through no fault of their own,"" she said. See more stories and videos like this Sally's life was turned upside down following the financial crash in 2008 Sally Stracey from Witham, Essex, said she had to make four people redundant shortly after the global crash. ""It was horrendously stressful,"" she said. ""I was working as a drawing office manager in the construction industry. ""The subcontractor that I worked for got into severe difficulty. It meant all the staff below me were made redundant. ""Our company went under in 2009. I'd sensed that something was wrong and left just before that happened."" But, with no job, Sally, at the age of 45, had to move 200 miles south, rent out her home in rural Derbyshire and move in with her mother, in Essex. It had been difficult at first, she said, until they had created their own spaces in the home. And then, in 2010, her mother was diagnosed with lung cancer and Sally was glad to be able to be there to look after her while she was ill. Sally's mother died the same year. Eventually, Sally found another job, again in the construction industry. And, 10 years later, she said: ""I am in a far, far better job, I have a new house in Essex and a great lifestyle."" Sally is also on a much better salary. And, all in all, she said, for her, the financial crash had been a ""blessing in disguise"".

"Ten years after the financial crisis, and the shockwaves are still being felt on people's finances. Personal debt levels are at record highs and our banks are fast disappearing from the high street. Low interest rate have left savers enduring a decade of paltry returns, but it's never been cheaper for mortgage borrowers. In the changed financial environment, the question to ask is: ""Are my finances fit for the next decade?"" Here, we examine four personal finances areas - homes, savings, borrowing and banking - to discover the lasting legacy of the financial crisis. The average UK house price fell from a pre-crisis peak of Â£190,032 in September 2007 to a low of Â£154,452 in March 2009, according to data from the Office for National Statistics and the Land Registry. Since then, the price of an average house has recovered to Â£228,384. Is that good news for homeowners? Not necessarily. There's no such thing as an average house, and for homeowners there's been a real north-south divide in the last decade in terms of property prices. Londoners and those in the south-east have seen prices soar, but elsewhere in the country, the picture is much different. Richard Donnell, insight director at Hometrack, said: ""Although a decade has passed since the crash, house prices have still not recovered back to the levels seen in 2008 in many markets across Britain. ""Northern Ireland and parts of northern England, Scotland and Wales are the areas most affected. House prices continued to fall in the markets most affected for up to four years after 2008 as demand for housing was impacted by tighter credit availability and weak economic growth."" In the capital, house prices started to bounce back strongly in 2010 on rising employment and increasing numbers of overseas investors, he said. It means the whole of the London housing market has house prices that are more than 50% higher than 2008 levels. What will happen next? Experts reckon prices will continue to rise but by less than in the last decade, and much less so in London. The UK Office for Budget Responsibility has predicted property price growth will fall to 2.4% by the end of 2019, while estate agents Strutt & Parker have predicted a 2.5% rise a year over the next two years. Meanwhile, accountants PWC have forecast that average UK house prices will rise by 4% a year until 2025. For Britain's savers, the last decade has been a disaster, especially those that had enjoyed decent returns in the years before. In fact. Â£1,000 tucked away in a savings account a decade before the crash would have yielded a healthy Â£652 in interest. But anyone who stashed Â£1,000 in an account in the last ten years would have earned interest of just Â£149. That's because in September 2008, the average deposit account paid interest of 3.1%, according to Bank of England data. That now stands at 0.43%. Ten years ago you could get 5% on instant access savings, more than 6% on a one-year bond and 7% on a five-year bond from well-known established high street names. Now the best rates are nowhere near as generous, with just 1.35% offered on instant access, 2.05% for one year and 2.70% for five years. According to James Blower, founder of The Savings Guru, around 30 new banks and 40 new providers have entered the savings market since the crash.  ""The best interest rates almost entirely come from these new providers,"" he said. Yet the traditional big financial institutions still hold around 85% of savings in the UK, with many savers' loyalty repaid by getting little or no interest on their nest-eggs. Hargreaves Lansdown analysis suggests there has been a huge rise in the amount of money held in accounts paying no interest in the last decade, from Â£48bn in September 2008 to Â£164bn today. ""While the value of the savings market has continued to grow around 5% a year to more than Â£1.5tn, the new entrants have taken much of the growth in the market, rather than make significant progress against the big players,"" said Mr Blower. But things could improve soon, predicted Sarah Coles, personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. ""At this point, savers have reason to be marginally more optimistic about the future,"" she said. ""That's because the regulator is looking more closely at how the industry functions, in an effort to protect savers from the lowest rates."" Average household debt has climbed from less than Â£3,000 to Â£4,000 in the last decade. There are lots of reasons for this, not least the easy credit that is available through plastic cards. Credit card companies have been competing to offer ever-longer interest-free periods to attract customers. In 2008 the longest 0% balance transfer was 15 months. Today, it is 36 months, although at one stage it reached a record high of 43 months. Analyst Andrew Hagger, of Moneycomms,co.uk, said: ""I'm not sure this is a good thing for all. Some savvy customers have moved balances around and paid little or no interest but others have struggled to repay their debt when their 0% deal ended - so are now being charged 20% APR or more."" He said it was one reason why personal debt levels have risen. ""It's been easy and cheap money a-plenty over the last decade but paying it back will prove to be a long and costly struggle for some."" Overdrafts have also changed in the last decade. Most banks have changed the way they charge, moving from charging by a traditional interest rates to either daily or monthly fees. ""Providers have proclaimed that daily fees are easier to understand,"" said Mr Hagger. ""That may be true, but at the same time they are also much more expensive for customers and a big profit driver."" The simple truth is that the way to reduce debt is to pay it off as quickly as you can and ignore the temptation of easy credit. With interest rates on the rise, what seems manageable debt now can quickly spiral into problems. There's a completely different banking landscape from 10 years ago, not least because traditional players have been busy closing branches. But at the same time the crisis marked the beginning of the entry of a whole new range of challenger banks. Back in 2008, the most likely challengers looked set to be the supermarkets, Tesco and Sainsbury's. Now the biggest challenge to traditional banking comes from branch-free app banks, such as Starling or Monzo. Julian Skan, senior managing director in banking at Accenture Strategy, said: ""Wider competition is now coming from platform players, which didn't exist ten years ago, and who have greater opportunities to bite at banking revenues."" But he warned that computer attacks are likely to increase in the years ahead, bringing a fresh challenge. ""Resiliency in the face of growing cyber risks is the new threat,"" Mr Skan said. But there also needs a change in outlook, according to Bevis Watts, managing director of ethical challenger Triodos Bank UK. He said: ""The pace of change has been far too slow and more needs to be done to re-purpose banking for good, through greater transparency on how money is used, carbon disclosure, impact reporting and using risk capital weightings to account for environmental and societal risks."" In other words, banks need to respond to the changing demands from customers in the next decade. Workers are Â£800 a year poorer post-crisis Who was to blame for the financial crisis?
