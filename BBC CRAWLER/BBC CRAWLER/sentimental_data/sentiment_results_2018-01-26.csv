"This video can not be played The history of Bombardier in Northern Ireland Bombardier has won a trade case in the United States, overturning a decision to impose damaging tariffs on imports of its C-Series aircraft. In December,the US Commerce Department ruledthe UK and Canada had given unfair subsidies to Bombardier to help it build the aircraft. But in a surprise ruling, the US International Trade Commission (ITC)rejected the complaint brought by Boeing. We look at the case. The case relates to a major order for Bombardier from the US airline Delta for 75 C-Series aircraft. Unions argued a tariff would threaten sales and UK jobs would be hit Boeing complained to the US Commerce Department that they had been sold at ""absurdly low prices"" in violation of trade law and this was made possible by unfair subsidies to Bombardier from the British and Canadian governments. Bombardier has received Â£135m in UK aid, almost all of it a loan towards a new C-Series wing factory in Belfast which opened in 2013. About 50 companies in the UK supply Bombardier with parts for the C-Series. The case relates to a major order for Bombardier from the US airline Delta for 75 C-Series aircraft. The UK government sided with Bombardier. The company employs about 4,000 people in Northern Ireland. Its main factories are in constituencies held by the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), who have a confidence-and-supply deal keeping Theresa May in power. The prime minister lobbied President Donald Trump on Bombardier's behalf, but the government resisted trade union calls to cancel defence contracts with Boeing. Bombardier said Boeing never lost out in the Delta order as it does not make the small size of plane requested. Some analysts wondered if Boeing was simply out to damage a competitor. The Canadian aerospace firm is Northern Ireland's largest manufacturing employer Following an investigation last year,it made a final ruling on 20 December. It recommended an import tariff of 292% be added to the price of each C-Series plane sold in America. US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said: ""The United States will always stand up for American workers and companies being harmed by unfair imports."" Bombardier's C-series jets began rollout in 2016, thanks to major contributions from both Quebec and the federal government. Cost over-runs on the C-Series almost bankrupted Bombardier. Orders have been sluggish and the fear was tariffs would damage sales prospects in America and have a knock-on impact on jobs. The stakes were arguably made higher because Bombardier is the biggest manufacturing company in Northern Ireland and is important to its economy. However, even before its victory at the US ITC, Bombardier was hopeful for the future after Airbus announced it would acquire a controlling stake in the C-Series and promised to boost its fortunes.

"Nearly 160 women have accused Nassar of sexual abuse The entire USA Gymnastics (USAG) board has said it will comply with a US Olympic Committee's (USOC) ultimatum to resign over an abuse scandal. The USOC earlier said the 18-member board must step down by 31 January or lose status as a sports governing body. The USOC outlined steps the board must take after ex-USAG doctor Larry Nassar was sentenced to 40 to 175 years for sexually abusing young athletes. Five directors of the USAG board have already resigned amid the fallout. Two Michigan State University (MSU) officials have also quit after the school became embroiled in the scandal. This video can not be played What it was like to testify against Larry Nassar Michigan State athletic director Mark Hollis stepped down on Friday following reports that the school knew of the abuse claims but failed to take action. He said he was ""brought to tears"" as he listened to Nassar's victims during his sentencing on Tuesday. ""My heart breaks thinking about the incomprehensible pain all of them and their families have experienced,"" he said in a statement. Nassar, 54, worked at MSU between 1997 and 2016 and served as national medical co-ordinator for USAG from 1996 to 2014. Nearly 160 women have accused him of sexual abuse. This video can not be played From the courtroom: Rachael Denhollander's powerful testimony USAG has admitted dragging its feet on alerting the authorities when it learned of abuse allegations against Nassar in 2015. Multiple molestation complaints from young athletes against the physician between 1997 and 2014 were ignored by MSU. USOC CEO Scott Blackmun wrote in a letter on Thursday that USAG board directors had six days to resign and until 28 February to replace them with an interim panel. ""While the USOC encourages USAG to think and act broadly on reforming its culture, we also believe that reform must start with an entirely new board,"" Mr Blackmun wrote. Critics of Ms Simon say she failed to take action after learning of Nassar abuse claims He outlined six steps the sports body must take, including: Replace interim board members in the next 12 months USAG must co-operate with ""an independent investigation"" looking into whether the anyone knew of and ignored the abuse allegations against Nassar The board ""must substantially discuss"" plans for combating abuse In a statement on Thursday night, USAG said it ""completely embraces the requirements outlined"" in the letter and ""appreciates the opportunity to work with the USOC to accomplish change"". Michael Burns, the head men's gymnastics coach at the University of Minnesota, became at least the fifth member to resign from USAG's board on Friday. Allow Twitter content?

He confirmed in an email he submitted his resignation letter on Wednesday. Both USAG and MSU deny there was a cover-up, but some victims have criticised both organisations for not doing enough to prevent the abuse. Mr Hollis' resignation from the university comes a day after the Michigan State University President Lou Anna Simon quit amid increasing calls for her resignation over the case. But it was revealed on Friday that Ms Simon can opt to return to a faculty position and take a 12-month leave of absence to conduct research, during which time she would receive her $750,000 (Â£529,000) salary,according to her contract, which was provided to CNN by Michigan State spokesman Jason Cody,external. Olympic gold medallist Aly Raisman, who testified at Nassar's sentencing, slammed USOC in a tweet on Thursday. Also on Friday, the US House Energy and Commerce Committee announced it would launch an investigation into sexual abuse in organised sports following Nassar's case.

"Left-right: Nicky Campbell, Huw Edwards, Jon Sopel, Jeremy Vine, Nick Robinson and John Humphrys Six of the BBC's leading male presenters have agreed to take pay cuts after revelations over equal salaries. The BBC said Huw Edwards, Nicky Campbell, John Humphrys, Jon Sopel, Nick Robinson and Jeremy Vine had all accepted reduced wages. The move follows Carrie Gracie'sresignation as BBC China editorin protest at unequal pay between male and female international editors. Humphrys said he would be earning ""hugely less"" than the Â£600,000 he was. The move comes after the BBCrevealed the pay of on-air talent earning over Â£150,000in July. Two-thirds of stars on the list, including the top seven earners, were men. This video can not be played John Humphrys says pay cut is 'fair' Humphrys, the presenter on Radio 4's flagship Today programme and Mastermind, was revealed to have earned between Â£600,000 and Â£649,999 in 2016/17. He refused to confirm or deny reports that his pay packet had been halved, to Â£250,000-Â£300,000, but did say his new salary would be ""a lot less than Â£600,000"". He said he had, in fact, taken a total of three pay cuts. ""It seemed fair,"" he told BBC News. ""The BBC used to have, in the good old days, an awful lot of money. ""It no longer has an awful lot of money. I was earning a lot of money and it seemed entirely proper to me that I should take a few pay cuts."" Of the six men, Radio 2 and Eggheads presenter Jeremy Vine was the best-paid of the group, earning between Â£700,000-Â£749,999 in 2016/17. Jon Sopel, the BBC's North America editor, earned the least, in the Â£200,000-Â£249,999 bracket - compared to Carrie Gracie's Â£135,000-a-year salary. The BBC did not comment how much the presenters would now receive. A BBC statement said: ""We are very grateful to Huw Edwards, Nicky Campbell, John Humphrys, Jon Sopel, Nick Robinson and Jeremy Vine, who have agreed that their pay will now be reduced. ""These are great journalists and presenters, who have a real connection with the audience. We are proud to have them working at the BBC. ""The final details of some of these changes are still being discussed, and there are further conversations that the BBC will have with others in due course."" Carrie Gracie published an open letter giving her reasons for resigning as China editor On his way into work at Radio 2 on Friday, Vine was asked by reporters why he had agreed to a lower wage. ""I think it needs to be sorted out and I support my female colleagues who have rightly said they should be paid the same when they're doing the same job,"" he said. ""It's just a no-brainer, so it wasn't a problem for me to accept one [a pay cut]."" An independent audit into equal pay at the BBC will be published next week. When the list of the best-paid BBC presenters that was published last summer, Chris Evans was at the top, earning between Â£2.2m and Â£2.25m in 2016/2017. The highest-paid woman, Claudia Winkleman, earned significantly less - between Â£450,000 and Â£500,000. BBC media editor Amol Rajan said while competition in the entertainment industry had intensified, the opposite had happened in news. ""Many of those now taking pay cuts secured generous deals years ago,"" he said. ""That world has disappeared - and these presenters now accept that a chunk of their salaries will have to disappear with it."" This video can not be played Jeremy Vine: Taking a pay cut is 'a no-brainer' After leaving her post as China editor, Gracie is now returning to the BBC newsroom in London, saying she expects to be ""paid equally"". She is due to appear before a select committee of MPs on Wednesday next week, shortly before director general of the BBC Tony Hall, his deputy Anne Bulford and director of news and current affairs Fran Unsworth. They were called to discuss what action the corporation is taking to address the gender pay gap. Damian Collins MP, chair of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee, said: ""While it is admirable that these BBC presenters want to show solidarity for their female colleagues by taking a pay cut, it doesn't address the fundamental issues of pay inequality that Carrie Gracie and others have raised."" He added that they would hear from Gracie and senior BBC figures at the committee session. There have been three investigations into gender pay at the BBC: A report was published in October, in line with a requirement on all large organisations. Itfound the gender pay gap at the BBC was 9.3%,external, against a national average of 18.1% A judge-led audit of equal pay among rank-and-file staff published at the same time found there was ""no question of any systemic gender discrimination"" A review into the BBC's approach to the pay of on-air presenters, editors and correspondents is due to be published next week Lord Hall pledged to close the gap by 2020, saying the corporation should be ""an exemplar of what can be achieved when it comes to pay, fairness, gender and representation"".

"Clockwise from top left: Anthony Armour, Darnell Harte, Robbie Meerun, Elliot and Ellis Thornton-Kimmit were all killed in the crash A 15-year-old boy who caused the deaths of five people when the stolen car he was driving crashed into a tree has been detained for more than four years. Ellis, 12, and Elliott Thornton-Kimmitt, 14, died in the crash along with Darnell Harte, 15, Anthony Armour and Robbie Meerun, both 24. Leeds Crown Court heard the car ""split in two"" when it hit a tree in Meanwood, Leeds, at 88mph, on 25 November. The boy admitted five counts of causing death by dangerous driving. More stories from across Yorkshire This video can not be played The sisters of Darnell Harte say the sentence is too short West Yorkshire Police said the Renault Clio they were travelling in had been stolen from the Headingley area of the city earlier the same day. The boy, who cannot be named because of his age, was sentenced to four-and-a-half-years' detention and disqualified from driving for seven years and three months by Judge Peter Collier QC. The court heard eyewitnesses say the car was being driven erratically and on the wrong side of the road before it crashed. The prosecutor said a passerby who had gone to the aid of the passengers described seeing the boy fleeing the scene despite being told to wait for police. The Renault Clio struck a tree at speed, causing car parts to be strewn over the road and pavement The judge said: ""It was your driving of that car on that night which has caused all this pain and hurt. ""I know what happened that night will shape your life every day from now on. ""I do not think there will ever be a time of day when you will not remember what happened and regret what you did."" The stolen car hit a tree on Stonegate Road in Meanwood Outside court Darnell Harte's sisters wept as they spoke to reporters, with one saying: ""In two years' time he's going to be out and we're going to have to see his face and not say anything because he's served justice in some people's eyes - to me that's not justice, because I'm never going to see my little brother ever again. ""He was the best brother you could ever have."" Speaking at the time of the crash, police said they had been confronted by a scene of ""complete carnage"". Two of the passengers were pronounced dead at the site of the crash and three died a short time later in hospital. Supt Lisa Atkinson said the crash had affected ""many, many people"" After the hearing Supt Lisa Atkinson said: ""To lose three children and two adults in such a significant incident is absolutely horrendous. Many, many people were affected by it. ""I was working the weekend that it happened and I can speak personally about how everyone was affected, the emergency services, the residents. ""It was truly horrendous, a vehicle travelling at three times the speed limit in a residential area. ""A 15-year-old boy is now starting a sentence and he will be affected by this for the rest of his life."" Floral tributes were placed close to the scene in the days after the crash David Holderness from the Crown Prosecution Service said: ""This was a truly shocking crime in which five young people lost their lives. ""The defendant acted in a supremely dangerous way, driving erratically and at speeds of around 88mph in a residential area. ""Tragically, his victims paid the price of the driver's utter irresponsibility with their lives.""

"Russia has ridiculed a UK minister for suggesting it could cause ""thousands and thousands and thousands"" of deaths by crippling British infrastructure. Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson told the Daily Telegraph,externalMoscow was spying on energy supplies which, if cut, could cause ""total chaos"" in the country. But Russian Defence Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said Mr Williamson had ""lost his grasp on reason"". The comments were worthy of a Monty Python sketch, Mr Konashenkov added. He accused Mr Williamson of trying to scare the British public in an effort to get more money for the armed forces. UK security chief blames Russia for hacks Russian politicians dismiss May criticism UK 'must prepare for Russia fight' The UK has four undersea energy connections for electricity linked to mainland Europe and a further four for gas. Mr Williamson,who became defence secretary last November, said Russia had been researching these types of connections and would be willing to take action ""any other nation would see as completely unacceptable"". He told the paper: ""The plan for the Russians won't be for landing craft to appear in the South Bay in Scarborough, and off Brighton Beach. ""They are going to be thinking: 'How can we just cause so much pain to Britain?' ""Damage its economy, rip its infrastructure apart, actually cause thousands and thousands and thousands of deaths, but actually have an element of creating total chaos within the country."" It is a ""real threat"", he added. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Responding to the comments, Mr Konashenkov said Mr Williamson's ""morbid fear"" of Russian activities belonged in a children's comic book or an episode of Monty Python's Flying Circus. ""It would seem that in his fiery fight for banknotes in the defence budget, the British defence chief has lost an understanding of the boundaries of common sense,"" he said. ""For the minister's information, all data regarding the location of British power stations and pipelines is as secret as, for instance, photographs and the location of Westminster Abbey or Big Ben."" The warning comes after the chief of the National Cyber Security Centre, Ciaran Martin, said earlier this week thatRussia had already staged attacksagainst Britain's media, telecommunications and energy sectors over the past year. And head of the British army, Sir Nick Carter, has warned the UK is struggling to keep up with Russian capabilities. The Ministry of Defence is under pressure to avoid cuts that could be coming from the Treasury.

"Honey and Barry Sherman were renowned for their charity fundraising The Canadian billionaire couple found dead at their home in Toronto last month were murdered in a targeted killing, police say. The bodies of Barry, 75, and Honey Sherman, 70, were found on 15 December. Police said on Friday no-one had been charged, and declined to comment on any suspects. Barry Sherman, one of Canada's richest men, and his wife were well-known for their philanthropy, and their sudden deaths stunned many in the country. Media reports in the days after the couple's bodies were discovered quoted police sources saying they were investigating a murder-suicide theory. ""I don't know where that came from,"" Toronto police detective Susan Gomes told reporters, adding that it was just one of several theories under consideration. The new details of the case came on the same day that the pharmaceutical giant Apotex that Barry Sherman founded announced its CEO's resignation. Thousands mourn Canada billionaire couple Billionaire's family attack death reports Detective Gomes said the couple were last seen alive on the evening of 13 December and had no communication with family after that point. She said police investigators had found no sign of forced entry on any access points to the home. Two days later the pair were found fully clothed by the pool ""hanging by belts in a semi-seated position on the pool deck,"" she added. The Shermans were found dead inside their property by an estate agent who was helping them to sell their house Ms Gomes said that police came to the conclusion they were dealing with a double homicide after ""six weeks of evidence and its review"". Police believe the couple were ""targeted"", she added. ""I'm not going to discuss the suspects, or any suspects,"" Ms Gomes said. ""I'm not going to discuss any motives."" She said there was a ""significant list of people"" they were speaking to in the ongoing investigation. Police have until now released few details in the case, confirming only that they both died from ligature neck compression, or strangulation with material. Jessica Murphy, BBC News, Toronto It was clear at Barry and Honey Sherman's December funeral that the couple - who were beloved parents, grandparents, with deep ties to the community - would be deeply missed. But there was no escaping the fact that the mystery over how they died overshadowed the sombre service. The weeks of silence from authorities created plenty of space for speculation as to what happened to the prominent couple. Now, Toronto police have revealed some hints as to what occurred between 13 December, when the couple were last seen, and 15 December, when their bodies were discovered. A full answer is not likely anytime soon. Toronto detective Susan Gomes made clear there is plenty of evidence for police to still dig through. The family took issue with Canadian media reports of a possible murder-suicide, and later released a statement saying no-one close to the couple believed this. ""Our parents shared an enthusiasm for life and commitment to their family and community totally inconsistent with the rumours regrettably circulated in the media as to the circumstances surrounding their deaths,"" it read. The family's lawyer has reportedly hired a number of private detectives to carry out a parallel investigation into the case. They also hired a forensic pathologist to conduct a second post mortem examination. The couple's children have long maintained the initial police investigation into a possible murder-suicide was faulty Unnamed sources close to that investigation told CBC Toronto thatmarkings on their wrists showed evidence they had been bound at one point,external, but no rope or ties were discovered near to the bodies. The Toronto Star also quoted sources close to the family investigation as using the words  ""contract killing"" and ""staged homicide"" to describe the couple's death.,external The family said the police assessment on Friday that it was a double homicide was ""consistent with the findings of the independent autopsy and investigation"". The premises of Apotex were searched as part of the police investigation, as well as two homes belonging to the couple. Separately on Friday, Apotex - which sells generic medicines worldwide - said in a statement that its CEO, Jeremy Desai, had left the company to pursue other opportunities. A gifted student, Barry Sherman entered the pharmaceutical trade through his uncle's Empire Laboratories, working for him while still at university before buying the company when his uncle died. He went on to sell Empire, creating Apotex, the company that made him a billionaire and which now employs more than 10,000 people. Barry Sherman was widely credited with revolutionising the drug industry in Canada But he became embroiled in a family dispute, with his uncle's children seeking a stake in Apotex, arguing they had been cheated. A judge threw out their claim earlier this year. He also faced an investigation as to whether he had improperly held a fundraiser for Justin Trudeau before he became prime minister. Mrs Sherman was a board member for several hospitals, charities and Jewish organisations. The couple had four children and have given millions to charity. The couple's public funeral took place on 21 December and was attended by many from Toronto's prominent social circles, as well as dignitaries like Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

"Clockwise from top left: Anthony Armour, Darnell Harte, Robbie Meerun, Elliot and Ellis Thornton-Kimmit were all killed in the crash A 15-year-old boy who caused the deaths of five people when the stolen car he was driving crashed into a tree has been detained for more than four years. Ellis, 12, and Elliott Thornton-Kimmitt, 14, died in the crash along with Darnell Harte, 15, Anthony Armour and Robbie Meerun, both 24. Leeds Crown Court heard the car ""split in two"" when it hit a tree in Meanwood, Leeds, at 88mph, on 25 November. The boy admitted five counts of causing death by dangerous driving. More stories from across Yorkshire This video can not be played The sisters of Darnell Harte say the sentence is too short West Yorkshire Police said the Renault Clio they were travelling in had been stolen from the Headingley area of the city earlier the same day. The boy, who cannot be named because of his age, was sentenced to four-and-a-half-years' detention and disqualified from driving for seven years and three months by Judge Peter Collier QC. The court heard eyewitnesses say the car was being driven erratically and on the wrong side of the road before it crashed. The prosecutor said a passerby who had gone to the aid of the passengers described seeing the boy fleeing the scene despite being told to wait for police. The Renault Clio struck a tree at speed, causing car parts to be strewn over the road and pavement The judge said: ""It was your driving of that car on that night which has caused all this pain and hurt. ""I know what happened that night will shape your life every day from now on. ""I do not think there will ever be a time of day when you will not remember what happened and regret what you did."" The stolen car hit a tree on Stonegate Road in Meanwood Outside court Darnell Harte's sisters wept as they spoke to reporters, with one saying: ""In two years' time he's going to be out and we're going to have to see his face and not say anything because he's served justice in some people's eyes - to me that's not justice, because I'm never going to see my little brother ever again. ""He was the best brother you could ever have."" Speaking at the time of the crash, police said they had been confronted by a scene of ""complete carnage"". Two of the passengers were pronounced dead at the site of the crash and three died a short time later in hospital. Supt Lisa Atkinson said the crash had affected ""many, many people"" After the hearing Supt Lisa Atkinson said: ""To lose three children and two adults in such a significant incident is absolutely horrendous. Many, many people were affected by it. ""I was working the weekend that it happened and I can speak personally about how everyone was affected, the emergency services, the residents. ""It was truly horrendous, a vehicle travelling at three times the speed limit in a residential area. ""A 15-year-old boy is now starting a sentence and he will be affected by this for the rest of his life."" Floral tributes were placed close to the scene in the days after the crash David Holderness from the Crown Prosecution Service said: ""This was a truly shocking crime in which five young people lost their lives. ""The defendant acted in a supremely dangerous way, driving erratically and at speeds of around 88mph in a residential area. ""Tragically, his victims paid the price of the driver's utter irresponsibility with their lives.""

"Honey and Barry Sherman were renowned for their charity fundraising The Canadian billionaire couple found dead at their home in Toronto last month were murdered in a targeted killing, police say. The bodies of Barry, 75, and Honey Sherman, 70, were found on 15 December. Police said on Friday no-one had been charged, and declined to comment on any suspects. Barry Sherman, one of Canada's richest men, and his wife were well-known for their philanthropy, and their sudden deaths stunned many in the country. Media reports in the days after the couple's bodies were discovered quoted police sources saying they were investigating a murder-suicide theory. ""I don't know where that came from,"" Toronto police detective Susan Gomes told reporters, adding that it was just one of several theories under consideration. The new details of the case came on the same day that the pharmaceutical giant Apotex that Barry Sherman founded announced its CEO's resignation. Thousands mourn Canada billionaire couple Billionaire's family attack death reports Detective Gomes said the couple were last seen alive on the evening of 13 December and had no communication with family after that point. She said police investigators had found no sign of forced entry on any access points to the home. Two days later the pair were found fully clothed by the pool ""hanging by belts in a semi-seated position on the pool deck,"" she added. The Shermans were found dead inside their property by an estate agent who was helping them to sell their house Ms Gomes said that police came to the conclusion they were dealing with a double homicide after ""six weeks of evidence and its review"". Police believe the couple were ""targeted"", she added. ""I'm not going to discuss the suspects, or any suspects,"" Ms Gomes said. ""I'm not going to discuss any motives."" She said there was a ""significant list of people"" they were speaking to in the ongoing investigation. Police have until now released few details in the case, confirming only that they both died from ligature neck compression, or strangulation with material. Jessica Murphy, BBC News, Toronto It was clear at Barry and Honey Sherman's December funeral that the couple - who were beloved parents, grandparents, with deep ties to the community - would be deeply missed. But there was no escaping the fact that the mystery over how they died overshadowed the sombre service. The weeks of silence from authorities created plenty of space for speculation as to what happened to the prominent couple. Now, Toronto police have revealed some hints as to what occurred between 13 December, when the couple were last seen, and 15 December, when their bodies were discovered. A full answer is not likely anytime soon. Toronto detective Susan Gomes made clear there is plenty of evidence for police to still dig through. The family took issue with Canadian media reports of a possible murder-suicide, and later released a statement saying no-one close to the couple believed this. ""Our parents shared an enthusiasm for life and commitment to their family and community totally inconsistent with the rumours regrettably circulated in the media as to the circumstances surrounding their deaths,"" it read. The family's lawyer has reportedly hired a number of private detectives to carry out a parallel investigation into the case. They also hired a forensic pathologist to conduct a second post mortem examination. The couple's children have long maintained the initial police investigation into a possible murder-suicide was faulty Unnamed sources close to that investigation told CBC Toronto thatmarkings on their wrists showed evidence they had been bound at one point,external, but no rope or ties were discovered near to the bodies. The Toronto Star also quoted sources close to the family investigation as using the words  ""contract killing"" and ""staged homicide"" to describe the couple's death.,external The family said the police assessment on Friday that it was a double homicide was ""consistent with the findings of the independent autopsy and investigation"". The premises of Apotex were searched as part of the police investigation, as well as two homes belonging to the couple. Separately on Friday, Apotex - which sells generic medicines worldwide - said in a statement that its CEO, Jeremy Desai, had left the company to pursue other opportunities. A gifted student, Barry Sherman entered the pharmaceutical trade through his uncle's Empire Laboratories, working for him while still at university before buying the company when his uncle died. He went on to sell Empire, creating Apotex, the company that made him a billionaire and which now employs more than 10,000 people. Barry Sherman was widely credited with revolutionising the drug industry in Canada But he became embroiled in a family dispute, with his uncle's children seeking a stake in Apotex, arguing they had been cheated. A judge threw out their claim earlier this year. He also faced an investigation as to whether he had improperly held a fundraiser for Justin Trudeau before he became prime minister. Mrs Sherman was a board member for several hospitals, charities and Jewish organisations. The couple had four children and have given millions to charity. The couple's public funeral took place on 21 December and was attended by many from Toronto's prominent social circles, as well as dignitaries like Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

"This video can not be played What we learned from Donald Trump's Davos speech President Donald Trump has told global finance leaders he will always put the US first when it comes to trade, but ""that does not mean America alone"". ""The US is open for business,"" he said in his inaugural address to the World Economic Forum in Davos on Friday. But he continued to attack ""predatory"" trade practices, warning partners that the US would not tolerate unfair trade. Mr Trump's election campaign centred on America First, aiming to protect local manufacturers from foreign competition. This policy appeared to contradict the Davos conference's goal of promoting globalisation and co-operation. Kamal Ahmed: Trump 2.0 on trade Can Trump claim credit for bonus rush? Davos divided over Trump Davos jargon: A crime against the English language? Mr Trump lauded the economic achievements of his first year in office, including cutting corporation tax and lowering the unemployment rate, and said the US was more attractive than ever to foreign investment. ""I'm here to deliver a simple message - there has never been a better time to hire, to build, to invest and to grow in the United States. America is open for business and we are competitive once again,"" he said. Taking credit for the strong economy in the US, he urged foreign investors to ""bring your money, your jobs, your businesses to America"". As he was speaking,latest figures for US economic growth were released, showing a slowdown in growth from 3.2% to 2.6% in the final quarter of last year.This meant annual growth for 2017 was 2.3%, up from 1.5% in 2016 but below the president's 3% target. By Kamal Ahmed, BBC economics editor ""America First, not America alone."" It was the key line of the speech, and a message echoed by other leading members of the White House power pack here. This is all about trade and the US approach. The fear was that America under Mr Trump would throw up a series of trade barriers, increasing protectionism at a time when most government leaders at Davos - Narendra Modi of India, Justin Trudeau of Canada and Emmanuel Macron of France - were preaching the gospel of globalisation. But today we heard a more nuanced manifesto. America, Mr Trump said, did not want a trade war, it wanted fair trade. Which may come as a surprise to countries like South Korea, smarting this week following the imposition of tariffs on US imports of solar panels and washing machines. Read more from Kamal The US president demanded a reformed international trade system that was ""fair and reciprocal"" and accused unidentified countries of unfair practices, including ""massive intellectual property theft"" and providing state aid to industry. Mr Trump also said he preferred bilateral fair trade agreements with other countries, including those signed up to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) from which he has withdrawn. He said he would consider negotiating with TPP states collectively, if it was in America's interest. He later tweeted that his speech had been well received. Allow Twitter content?

But some attendees booed when he attacked the media and repeated accusations of them reporting ""fake news"" in a question and answer session after his address. ""As a businessman I was always treated really well by the pressâ¦ and it wasn't until I became a politician that I realised how nasty, how mean, how vicious and how fake the press can be,"" he said. The BBC's Katie Hope, who attended the speech, says anticipation was high but the audience's response was rather muted with some expecting a more conciliatory tone. Donald Trump's speech was eagerly anticipated Despite this, Mr Trump has had an overwhelmingly positive reception, with cheers on his arrival on Thursday in the main Congress Centre. In a meeting with UK Prime Minister Theresa May the same day, he said he expected ""a tremendous increase"" in trade between the US and Britain in the coming years. He has also saidhe is prepared to apologise for retweeting posts from a British far-right group last November, a move that sparked a Twitter row with Mrs May. In an interview Mr Trump told ITV's Piers Morgan: ""If you are telling me they're horrible people, horrible, racist people, I would certainly apologise if you'd like me to do that."" President Trump's speech comes days afterthe US announced new tariffs of up to 50% on imported washing machines and solar panels, prompting an outcry from China and South Korea - the primary targets of the measure. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, also in Davos, has warned of ""more to come"" on trade tariffs. What could China do in a US trade war? Donald who?

"This video can not be played Bombardier's Belfast workforce was not going to back down, said Unite's Susan Fitzgerald Canadian aerospace firm Bombardier has won a landmark case in the US, overturning a decision to impose huge 292% tariffs on imports of its C-Series planes, partly built in the UK. It follows a ruling by the US Commerce Department in December that the UK and Canada had given it unfair subsidies. UK Prime Minister Theresa May welcomed the ruling - which safeguards thousands of jobs in Northern Ireland. But it's seen as a blow to US President Trump's ""America first"" trade policy. Bombardier had been widely expected to lose the case, which followed a complaint by its US rival, Boeing. But in a surprise ruling, the US International Trade Commission (ITC) ruled in favour of the Canadian firm. Mrs May said it was ""good news"" for UK industry. ""Bombardier and its innovative workforce play a vital role in the Northern Ireland economy,"" she said. Bombardier ruling Q&A Reaction to surprise Bombardier ruling The ITC voted 4-0 in favour of Bombardier, ruling that there was no injury to US manufacturers. Tariffs of 292% will not now be imposed on orders of C-Series planes by US airlines. This video can not be played The history of Bombardier in Northern Ireland About 50 companies in the UK supply Bombardier with parts for the C-Series. One thousand jobs in Belfast, where the wings for the plane are made, depend on its success. The BBC's business correspondent, Theo Leggett, said the move came as ""a big surprise"" as ""most analysts thought the odds were stacked against Bombardier"". ""It is good news for workers at Bombardier's Belfast plant, where parts for the C-Series are made, but it's also good news for Airbus, which took advantage of Bombardier's struggles to take a majority stake in the C-Series."" A spokesperson for Bombardier said the ITC's decision was ""a victory for innovation, competition and the rule of law."" Steve Turner, Unite assistant general secretary said it was ""the right decision"" ""Its development and production represent thousands of jobs in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom."" A spokesperson for Boeing said it was ""disappointed"" by the ITC's decision and that it would ""review the detailed conclusions when they are released"". Steve Turner, Unite assistant general secretary said it was ""the right decision"". He said Bombardier workers in Northern Ireland and throughout the supply chain in UK ""will be breathing a huge sigh of relief"". Business Secretary Greg Clark said it was ""excellent news for the dedicated workforce in Northern Ireland and supply chain across the UK, who have a great future ahead"". ""The decision by the International Trade Commission confirms what the UK and Canadian governments working hand in hand has maintained from the outset, that this case is unjustified. We are pleased that the ITC have now recognised this,"" he said.

"Few people knew what to expect. Would this be belligerent Trump - wagging his finger at the global elite about how divorced they were from reality, from what people really want? Or would this be conciliatory Trump, setting a different tone? We heard the second. The president touched many of the World Economic Forum's erogenous zones. But many were not quite sure how to take it considering the pit bull they were expecting. He talked about the voices of the forgotten - a constant theme here among the ""super-haves"" who are coming to a creeping realisation that the system has to change if faith in the capitalist system is to endure. He talked about economic success being about more than the sum of production, it was about the ""sum of its citizens"". Businesses, he argued, had to remember their obligations to the people who worked for them. Critics will pick at the easy holes. For example, on those income tax cuts it's the wealthy who will gain more. And the business tax cuts are far larger than those for middle-income Americans. Mr Trump said that America First did not mean America Alone. It was the key line of the speech. And it was a message echoed by other leading members of the White House power pack here, including Gary Cohn, the president's chief economic adviser and head of the US National Economic Council. This is all about trade and the US approach. The fear was that America under Mr Trump would throw up a series of trade barriers, increasing protectionism at a time when most government leaders at Davos - Narendra Modi of India, Justin Trudeau of Canada and Emmanuel Macron of France - were preaching the gospel of globalisation. Trump launches attack on 'predatory' trade US revives talk of post-Brexit trade deal Polish PM says UK must pay for EU access But today we heard a more nuanced manifesto. America, Mr Trump said, did not want a trade war, it wanted fair trade. Which may come as a surprise to countries like South Korea, smarting this week followingthe imposition of tariffs on US imports of solar panels and washing machines. Mr Trump's argument is this: The rules of the free trade world were built after the Second World War when America's economic interests were rooted in the successful development of other countries' economies. These countries then became eager customers for American products. That equation has changed. China is a much more powerful economy. The Asian emerging markets, South America and Europe all now have much more muscular dogs in the fight for global trade. Mr Trump said state planning, intellectual property theft and industrial subsidies were the new weapons of trade wars - and used against America. ""Fair and reciprocal trade"" is the new US mantra. And if the administration feels it does not receive such treatment, the president will act - for example, by passing an executive order pulling the US out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the 12-nation Asian trade deal. It's a message that has not fallen on stony ground here. ""I don't think it's inappropriate that we re-look at some of the treaties that were so asymmetric,"" Larry Fink, the chief executive of investment company BlackRock, told me. ""Some of these countries now are very strong and very developed. It's going to be a long game. ""The world is benefitting by global trade and we need to find ways of creating more global trade to benefit more humanity worldwide,"" he said. America is still a trading nation, one which gains far more economically from globalisation - world trade - than it does from protectionist measures. And that brute economic truth means that Mr Trump has to play a different tune here - to the business leaders and investors who decide where to place their cash - than maybe to the left-behind voters of the US rust belt. So the president said that America was ready to do bilateral deals that would be ""mutually beneficial"". He even suggested a re-engagement with the TPP. On trade, this was Trump 2.0. The politics might have been angry in the past, but today, economic reality softened the president.

"US economic growth slowed unexpectedly to an annualised rate of 2.6% in the last three months of 2017, the Commerce Department said on Friday. Economists had expected the rate to be 3% - the same as the three months to September. A surge in imports was blamed for the slowdown, which meant growth for 2017 came in at 2.3%. That was better than the 1.5% posted in 2016, but well short of President Donald Trump's 3% target. Imports surged by 13.9% in the quarter - the fastest pace since the third quarter of 2010 - offsetting a rise in exports. As a result, trade sliced off 1.1 percentage points from GDP growth in the three months. Despite the slowdown, economists expect the US economy to expand by 3% this year, spurred by the weak dollar, rising oil prices and a strong global economy. The figure is below the previous quarter and less than what was expected, but not by much. If rather than using the annualised figures that the US Bureau of Economic Affairs always publishes, we consider the simple quarterly growth numbers, the slowdown is just 0.2% and the miss compared to expectations only half of that. One of the reasons for the slightly lower figure is firms reducing their inventories - selling off goods they have already produced. They cannot do that forever. Manufacturers will have to start replenishing their stocks sooner or later. The positive in the figures was a strong surge in business investment. The conclusion: the figures point to an economy whose underlying growth is pretty firm. Addressing the World Economic Forum in Davos, Mr Trump hailed the strong US economic growth: ""The world is witnessing the resurgence of a strong and prosperous America."" ""Now is the best time to bring your money, your jobs, your businesses to America,"" he said, pointing to recent tax reform and curbs on red tape as good for the investment climate. The president made another attack on ""predatory"" and said the US will not tolerate unfair trade. The US dollar made up some ground against sterling and the euro after the GDP figures were released, but has fallen more than five cents against both currencies in the past three months.

But he continued to attack ""predatory"" trade practices, warning partners that the US would not tolerate unfair trade. Mr Trump's election campaign centred on America First, aiming to protect local manufacturers from foreign competition. This policy appeared to contradict the Davos conference's goal of promoting globalisation and co-operation. Kamal Ahmed: Trump 2.0 on trade Can Trump claim credit for bonus rush? Davos divided over Trump Davos jargon: A crime against the English language? Mr Trump lauded the economic achievements of his first year in office, including cutting corporation tax and lowering the unemployment rate, and said the US was more attractive than ever to foreign investment. ""I'm here to deliver a simple message - there has never been a better time to hire, to build, to invest and to grow in the United States. America is open for business and we are competitive once again,"" he said. Taking credit for the strong economy in the US, he urged foreign investors to ""bring your money, your jobs, your businesses to America"". As he was speaking,latest figures for US economic growth were released, showing a slowdown in growth from 3.2% to 2.6% in the final quarter of last year.This meant annual growth for 2017 was 2.3%, up from 1.5% in 2016 but below the president's 3% target. By Kamal Ahmed, BBC economics editor ""America First, not America alone."" It was the key line of the speech, and a message echoed by other leading members of the White House power pack here. This is all about trade and the US approach. The fear was that America under Mr Trump would throw up a series of trade barriers, increasing protectionism at a time when most government leaders at Davos - Narendra Modi of India, Justin Trudeau of Canada and Emmanuel Macron of France - were preaching the gospel of globalisation. But today we heard a more nuanced manifesto. America, Mr Trump said, did not want a trade war, it wanted fair trade. Which may come as a surprise to countries like South Korea, smarting this week following the imposition of tariffs on US imports of solar panels and washing machines. Read more from Kamal The US president demanded a reformed international trade system that was ""fair and reciprocal"" and accused unidentified countries of unfair practices, including ""massive intellectual property theft"" and providing state aid to industry. Mr Trump also said he preferred bilateral fair trade agreements with other countries, including those signed up to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) from which he has withdrawn. He said he would consider negotiating with TPP states collectively, if it was in America's interest. He later tweeted that his speech had been well received. Allow Twitter content?

But some attendees booed when he attacked the media and repeated accusations of them reporting ""fake news"" in a question and answer session after his address. ""As a businessman I was always treated really well by the pressâ¦ and it wasn't until I became a politician that I realised how nasty, how mean, how vicious and how fake the press can be,"" he said. The BBC's Katie Hope, who attended the speech, says anticipation was high but the audience's response was rather muted with some expecting a more conciliatory tone. Donald Trump's speech was eagerly anticipated Despite this, Mr Trump has had an overwhelmingly positive reception, with cheers on his arrival on Thursday in the main Congress Centre. In a meeting with UK Prime Minister Theresa May the same day, he said he expected ""a tremendous increase"" in trade between the US and Britain in the coming years. He has also saidhe is prepared to apologise for retweeting posts from a British far-right group last November, a move that sparked a Twitter row with Mrs May. In an interview Mr Trump told ITV's Piers Morgan: ""If you are telling me they're horrible people, horrible, racist people, I would certainly apologise if you'd like me to do that."" President Trump's speech comes days afterthe US announced new tariffs of up to 50% on imported washing machines and solar panels, prompting an outcry from China and South Korea - the primary targets of the measure. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, also in Davos, has warned of ""more to come"" on trade tariffs. What could China do in a US trade war? Donald who?

"This video can not be played Bombardier's Belfast workforce was not going to back down, said Unite's Susan Fitzgerald Canadian aerospace firm Bombardier has won a landmark case in the US, overturning a decision to impose huge 292% tariffs on imports of its C-Series planes, partly built in the UK. It follows a ruling by the US Commerce Department in December that the UK and Canada had given it unfair subsidies. UK Prime Minister Theresa May welcomed the ruling - which safeguards thousands of jobs in Northern Ireland. But it's seen as a blow to US President Trump's ""America first"" trade policy. Bombardier had been widely expected to lose the case, which followed a complaint by its US rival, Boeing. But in a surprise ruling, the US International Trade Commission (ITC) ruled in favour of the Canadian firm. Mrs May said it was ""good news"" for UK industry. ""Bombardier and its innovative workforce play a vital role in the Northern Ireland economy,"" she said. Bombardier ruling Q&A Reaction to surprise Bombardier ruling The ITC voted 4-0 in favour of Bombardier, ruling that there was no injury to US manufacturers. Tariffs of 292% will not now be imposed on orders of C-Series planes by US airlines. This video can not be played The history of Bombardier in Northern Ireland About 50 companies in the UK supply Bombardier with parts for the C-Series. One thousand jobs in Belfast, where the wings for the plane are made, depend on its success. The BBC's business correspondent, Theo Leggett, said the move came as ""a big surprise"" as ""most analysts thought the odds were stacked against Bombardier"". ""It is good news for workers at Bombardier's Belfast plant, where parts for the C-Series are made, but it's also good news for Airbus, which took advantage of Bombardier's struggles to take a majority stake in the C-Series."" A spokesperson for Bombardier said the ITC's decision was ""a victory for innovation, competition and the rule of law."" Steve Turner, Unite assistant general secretary said it was ""the right decision"" ""Its development and production represent thousands of jobs in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom."" A spokesperson for Boeing said it was ""disappointed"" by the ITC's decision and that it would ""review the detailed conclusions when they are released"". Steve Turner, Unite assistant general secretary said it was ""the right decision"". He said Bombardier workers in Northern Ireland and throughout the supply chain in UK ""will be breathing a huge sigh of relief"". Business Secretary Greg Clark said it was ""excellent news for the dedicated workforce in Northern Ireland and supply chain across the UK, who have a great future ahead"". ""The decision by the International Trade Commission confirms what the UK and Canadian governments working hand in hand has maintained from the outset, that this case is unjustified. We are pleased that the ITC have now recognised this,"" he said.

"The UK economy expanded by a better-than-expected 0.5% in the last three months of 2017, official figures say. Economists had expected a 0.4% expansion in the three months to December. However, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the broader picture was ""slower and more uneven"" growth. In 2017 as a whole, growth was 1.8% compared with 1.9% in 2016 - the slowest since 2012, the ONS said. The services sector, which accounts for the bulk of the economy, expanded by 0.6% in the fourth quarter - stronger than the 0.4% rise in the three months to September. ""The boost to the economy at the end of the year came from a range of services including recruitment agencies, letting agents and office management,"" said Darren Morgan, head of GDP at the ONS. Carney calls for 'deeper relationship' with Europe Mortgage approvals at five-year low Yet consumer-facing parts of the services sector, which include distribution, hotels, catering, transport and communications, posted much slower growth, he said. Manufacturing also grew strongly, but construction contracted by 1% - its third consecutive fall and worst quarterly performance since the third quarter of 2012. John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, said construction appeared to be the sector most affected by Brexit-related uncertainty, deterring commercial property investment and dampening the housing market, particularly in London. Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Macroeconomics said the ""undeniably strong"" quarterly figures increased the chance of the Monetary Policy Committee raising interest rates again as soon as this summer. However, Hargreaves Lansdown senior economist Ben Brettell described growth as anaemic and doubted there would be more than one rate rise this year, ""probably in the autumn"". Sterling jumped 0.8% to $1.4253 following the release of the GDP figures. Choose your comparator. You might, like Bank of England governor Mark Carney, point out that the economy is about 1% smaller than the Bank predicted it would be before the Brexit vote. But that was in the event of a ""stay"" vote. Pro-Brexit critics might point out the economy is doing a lot better than his own warnings about the risk of a ""technical recession"" if the UK voted to leave. Annual growth of 1.8% may be less than we would like, but so far there is little sign of the Brexit-induced disaster that some predicted.

"The suspension of non-urgent operations to ease winter NHS pressures in England is to be lifted from February. Hospitals had been advised to defer non-urgent operations until mid-January, which was then extended in a bid to free up hospital staff and beds. Announcing the end of the suspension, an NHS emergency panel said pressures on the service had eased in January. Hospitals should be able to plan a ""return to a full elective care programme"" from next month, it said. The decision to end the suspension of non-urgent operations - which include hip or knee replacements - was taken at a meeting of the NHS's Emergency Pressures Panel (NEPP), which was set up to provide advice on winter pressure and clinical risk. In a letter to hospital bosses, it said there were early indications that levels of flu were stabilising and that pressures have eased since December.

"Left-right: Nicky Campbell, Huw Edwards, Jon Sopel, Jeremy Vine, Nick Robinson and John Humphrys Six of the BBC's leading male presenters have agreed to take pay cuts after revelations over equal salaries. The BBC said Huw Edwards, Nicky Campbell, John Humphrys, Jon Sopel, Nick Robinson and Jeremy Vine had all accepted reduced wages. The move follows Carrie Gracie'sresignation as BBC China editorin protest at unequal pay between male and female international editors. Humphrys said he would be earning ""hugely less"" than the Â£600,000 he was. The move comes after the BBCrevealed the pay of on-air talent earning over Â£150,000in July. Two-thirds of stars on the list, including the top seven earners, were men. This video can not be played John Humphrys says pay cut is 'fair' Humphrys, the presenter on Radio 4's flagship Today programme and Mastermind, was revealed to have earned between Â£600,000 and Â£649,999 in 2016/17. He refused to confirm or deny reports that his pay packet had been halved, to Â£250,000-Â£300,000, but did say his new salary would be ""a lot less than Â£600,000"". He said he had, in fact, taken a total of three pay cuts. ""It seemed fair,"" he told BBC News. ""The BBC used to have, in the good old days, an awful lot of money. ""It no longer has an awful lot of money. I was earning a lot of money and it seemed entirely proper to me that I should take a few pay cuts."" Of the six men, Radio 2 and Eggheads presenter Jeremy Vine was the best-paid of the group, earning between Â£700,000-Â£749,999 in 2016/17. Jon Sopel, the BBC's North America editor, earned the least, in the Â£200,000-Â£249,999 bracket - compared to Carrie Gracie's Â£135,000-a-year salary. The BBC did not comment how much the presenters would now receive. A BBC statement said: ""We are very grateful to Huw Edwards, Nicky Campbell, John Humphrys, Jon Sopel, Nick Robinson and Jeremy Vine, who have agreed that their pay will now be reduced. ""These are great journalists and presenters, who have a real connection with the audience. We are proud to have them working at the BBC. ""The final details of some of these changes are still being discussed, and there are further conversations that the BBC will have with others in due course."" Carrie Gracie published an open letter giving her reasons for resigning as China editor On his way into work at Radio 2 on Friday, Vine was asked by reporters why he had agreed to a lower wage. ""I think it needs to be sorted out and I support my female colleagues who have rightly said they should be paid the same when they're doing the same job,"" he said. ""It's just a no-brainer, so it wasn't a problem for me to accept one [a pay cut]."" An independent audit into equal pay at the BBC will be published next week. When the list of the best-paid BBC presenters that was published last summer, Chris Evans was at the top, earning between Â£2.2m and Â£2.25m in 2016/2017. The highest-paid woman, Claudia Winkleman, earned significantly less - between Â£450,000 and Â£500,000. BBC media editor Amol Rajan said while competition in the entertainment industry had intensified, the opposite had happened in news. ""Many of those now taking pay cuts secured generous deals years ago,"" he said. ""That world has disappeared - and these presenters now accept that a chunk of their salaries will have to disappear with it."" This video can not be played Jeremy Vine: Taking a pay cut is 'a no-brainer' After leaving her post as China editor, Gracie is now returning to the BBC newsroom in London, saying she expects to be ""paid equally"". She is due to appear before a select committee of MPs on Wednesday next week, shortly before director general of the BBC Tony Hall, his deputy Anne Bulford and director of news and current affairs Fran Unsworth. They were called to discuss what action the corporation is taking to address the gender pay gap. Damian Collins MP, chair of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee, said: ""While it is admirable that these BBC presenters want to show solidarity for their female colleagues by taking a pay cut, it doesn't address the fundamental issues of pay inequality that Carrie Gracie and others have raised."" He added that they would hear from Gracie and senior BBC figures at the committee session. There have been three investigations into gender pay at the BBC: A report was published in October, in line with a requirement on all large organisations. Itfound the gender pay gap at the BBC was 9.3%,external, against a national average of 18.1% A judge-led audit of equal pay among rank-and-file staff published at the same time found there was ""no question of any systemic gender discrimination"" A review into the BBC's approach to the pay of on-air presenters, editors and correspondents is due to be published next week Lord Hall pledged to close the gap by 2020, saying the corporation should be ""an exemplar of what can be achieved when it comes to pay, fairness, gender and representation"".

"A judge has ordered the Crown Prosecution Service to explain itself in a case that collapsed because social media evidence was not disclosed. The trial of three people held on trafficking and prostitution charges was stopped after the material cast doubt on the complainant's story. Judge Perrins said the failure to disclose material earlier ""would appear to be as a result of incompetence"". The CPS said it was ""concerned"" by the outcome and would review the case. The trial of Adrian Iordan, Anisoara Lautaru, Petruta-Cristina Bosoanca was stopped after the complainant in the case had been cross-examined. The defendants were charged with people trafficking under the Modern Slavery Act and controlling prostitution charges under the Sexual Offences Act. Hundreds of court cases axed over failings They were accused of conspiring to traffic a young woman to the UK from Romania for the purpose of prostitution. One defendant, Ms Bosoanca, gave birth during her 13 months in custody. By Clive Coleman, BBC legal correspondent This case could not illustrate more dramatically the devastating effect on people's lives that can result from a failure on the part of police and prosecutors to disclose evidence to the defence which can assist the defence. Cristina Bosoanca has spent more than 13 months in prison, during which time she has given birth, when she should never have been there in the first place. Her case also provides evidence that disclosure failures are not limited to rape and that there is, as lawyers in the criminal justice system have been telling me for years, a systemic problem with disclosure. At its heart is a seeming inability by police and prosecutors to recognise the extent to which valuable evidence is to be found where people now live their lives - online, on mobile phones and on social media. Searching these areas comprehensively for critical evidence is perhaps the criminal justice system's biggest challenge. In a ruling at London's Wood Green Crown Court, Judge Perrins said: ""It would also appear as though the court has been significantly misled as to the prosecution's state of readiness as well as the strength of the evidence at previous bail hearings as well as applications to extend the custody time limits. ""The fact that one defendant has had to give birth in custody and her baby is currently in prison with her makes this all the more shocking."" He demanded the CPS attend court on Wednesday to explain its failures in the case. The BBC understands that relevant social media material was known to the police from January 2017 but wasn't disclosed until December 2017. A CPS spokesman said: ""We are concerned by the outcome of the case and the comments of the judge today. ""It is clear there have been failings in this case, and it is being reviewed by senior CPS lawyers as a matter of urgency.""

"Molly McLaren met Joshua Stimpson on dating app Tinder A woman stabbed to death by her ex-boyfriend had at least 75 wounds to her neck, head and body, a jury heard. Molly McLaren, 23, was killed in a ""frenzied"" attack in her car at the Dockside shopping centre in Chatham, Kent, on 29 June. Joshua Stimpson, 26,has admitted manslaughterbut denies murder. Pathologist Dr Olaf Biedrzycki told Maidstone Crown Court Ms McLaren would have lost consciousness ""within seconds"". The jury also heard from a witness who said he tried to disrupt the knife attack by slamming Stimpson's leg in the car door. Benjamin Morton described to the court how he noticed a struggle inside the car and soon became aware ""it wasn't just a fight"" as the man ""seemed to have something in his hand"". He said: ""She was trying to defend herself at that point. He was clearly attacking her and she had her hands up to try to stop him."" After noticing blood in the car he called out across the car park for help and ""banged on the window, on the bonnet"" in a bid to distract Stimpson. The jury was told when the witness saw Stimpson trying to cut Ms McLaren's throat he moved to the driver's side of the car where his leg was sticking out and tried to slam the door on it. ""I grabbed his leg to see if I could pull him. His leg was covered in blood. I stepped back and looked inside the car. ""I could see her throat had been cut. He seemed determined to make sure she was dead."" When he realised Ms McLaren would not survive the attack he tried to prevent Stimpson from getting away. He then got his car and blocked Ms McLaren's car in until the police arrived, the court was told. Stimpson denies murder on the grounds of diminished responsibility. The trial continues.

"This video can not be played Davis: No difference over Brexit aims David Davis has said there is ""no difference"" between him, the chancellor and prime minister following a Tory row over the terms of a Brexit transition. The Brexit Secretary said all three wanted the UK's exit from the EU in March 2019 to ""serve the British economy... and the British people"". There was a ""diversity of views"" in all parties and EU member states, he said. Backbench Tories had criticised Philip Hammond for saying that changes to UK-EU relations could be ""very modest"". No 10 distanced itself from Mr Hammond's remarks and one Tory MP said he should ""stick to the script"" the PM had laid out. Following a speech outlining some of his ambitions for an ""implementation period"" immediately after the UK leaves the EU in March 2019, Mr Davis was asked about the row. Laura Kuenssberg: Tories' Brexit agonies resurface Rees-Mogg and Hammond at odds over Brexit The key Brexit dates in 2018 He said: ""I'm in politics, people debate and  they have different views and there is a diversity of views on this subject in all parties. That doesn't mean we can't have a coherent and forceful view in the interests of the United Kingdom."" He added: ""There is no difference between the chancellor, and myself - and indeed the prime minister - in terms that we both want a Brexit which serves the British economy and which serves the British people. There will be arguments about the tactics but they will change - the options available to us will change throughout the negotiations. ""We want a good Brexit for British business and a good Brexit for the British people and we will deliver that on a frictionless access to the single market and political and economic freedom for us in the future."" In his speech, Mr Davis said that the UK would be able to sign new trade deals in the ""implementation"" period - thought likely to last up to two years. The UK would still effectively follow the rules of the EU customs union for the period immediately after Brexit and no trade deals could come into force until it ended. But he said: ""As an independent country - no longer a member of the European Union - the United Kingdom will once again have its own trading policy. This video can not be played Hammond: I want maximum access to EU markets ""For the first time in more than 40 years, we will be able to step out and sign new trade deals with old friends, and new allies, around the globe."" He said existing international agreements - which include trade deals with other countries and agreements on aviation and nuclear power - should continue to apply during the period. The ""immediate goal"" in negotiations, he added, would be to secure political agreement on an implementation phase by March's European Council summit. Analysis by BBC Reality Check correspondent Chris Morris This speech comes three days before the other EU member states are due to publish their formal guidelines (their terms and conditions in other words) for negotiations on the nature of a transition period after Brexit. Those negotiations are due to begin shortly, and Mr Davis is getting his response in first, as well as trying to address some of the political heat he's now feeling from Brexiteers. That's why he used the term 'implementation' rather than 'transition' period throughout his speech - it suggests that the UK will be implementing the consequences of Brexit. EU documents though always refer to a transition because other countries are convinced that negotiations on the future EU-UK relationship will not have been completed by the time the UK leaves. As well as smoothing the path for business, they argue that a transition is necessary to allow negotiations on future relations to continue. Failing to reach agreement would mean uncertainty for businesses, resulting in delayed investment and a ""stifling of hard-won economic growth"". Mr Davis also stressed the need for an ""appropriate process"" to allow the UK to resolve any concerns about new EU laws introduced during the implementation phase which were against its interests. The speech comes amida row in his partyover the government's approach to Brexit negotiations, following Mr Hammond's comments at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday. Downing Street distanced itself from his remarks although the prime minister's spokesman said on Friday she had full confidence in the chancellor. Asked whether his comments had been destabilising for the prime minister, Mr Hammond told the BBC: ""I think the context is important. I was speaking about our trade relationship with the EU, and it is the government's policy that we want to maintain the maximum possible access to markets and the minimum friction at our borders because that's good for the British economy."" But Eurosceptic Tory backbencher Bernard Jenkin told the BBC it would be easier for the PM if Mr Hammond and other cabinet ministers ""stuck to her script"" while Jacob Rees-Mogg said Mr Hammond ""must have been affected by high mountain air"" in the Swiss resort. In response to Mr Davis's speech, Hilary Benn, Labour chairman of the Commons Brexit committee, said ""what we really needed to hear is what the government's proposals are for the most important trade negotiation of all - with the European Union... On that, we are none the wiser"" And Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer said nothing Mr Davis had said ""can mask or hide the bitter infighting that is going on in the government about what form Brexit should take"".

"Midwife Margaret Wairimu Maina carries a backpack crammed with useful health monitoring tech Call the midwife in Nairobi, Kenya, and you may receive a visit from someone like Margaret Wairimu Maina. She sets off on foot looking something like an astronaut, carrying a backpack stuffed full of hi-tech gadgets designed to monitor a baby's health. The pack includes a wind-up foetal doppler used for measuring the baby's heartbeat, a portable ultrasound screen, a life-light with matching solar panel, in-ear thermometers, and a range of other medical instruments related to pregnancy. The gear has become crucial for her voluntary job as a community health worker. Although the backpack weighs just 5kg (11lb) it's still a heavy load as she does her rounds twice a week, says Margaret. She is responsible for more than 120 households in the local area and manages to see up to 20 a day when she visits between noon and 4pm. ""I have two sons, aged five and 11,"" she says. ""Both of my pregnancies were very OK with no complications because I started my ante-natal care visits after only two months, and I had a skilled attendant around for delivery."" Many other women in the country are not so lucky. In Kenya, unlike other African countries such as Ethiopia, primary health care is not paid for by the government or local authority. Margaret works out of the Kiambu Community Life Centre north of Nairobi, where voluntary health workers are the first point of contact for those seeking medical help. Many women in Kenya don't have any access to medical care ""In large parts of Africa, people like Margaret are unpaid volunteers who often lack formal training or even basic equipment to help them with their tasks,"" says Jasper Westerink, chief executive of Philips Africa, the firm that developed the backpack. ""For years, we have had strong focus on mother and child care in Africa."" Working with local government, Philips is developing a number of community life centres to support community health workers and midwives equipped with these hi-tech backpacks. ""Our ambition is to introduce this model throughout Africa to drastically improve access to primary care,"" says Mr Westerink. Meanwhile, on the other side of Nairobi lies Kibera. It is the biggest slum in Africa and though officially home to 500,000 people, some estimate it might actually hold two million inhabitants. Kibera is an open sewer with little or no sanitation - a random matrix of undulating roads and paths that ambulances cannot access. In fact, the only thing close to an ambulance is an improvised wheelbarrow with a yellow siren attached to its handles. Patients are placed in the cart and the lucky ones are wheeled to the community health clinic. But in the remote region of Mandera, on Kenya's north-eastern border between Somalia and Ethiopia, pregnant women don't even have the option of a wheelbarrow ambulance. It takes two days to reach the area by road from Nairobi and the infant mortality rate here is one of the highest in the world with almost 4,000 maternal deaths per 100,000 births. In the remote parts of north-east Kenya often the only way to travel is by camel Public transport is so expensive here that travelling by camel is the only option for pregnant women. It's not surprising that by the time they finally reach a doctor, they are not only in great danger of losing their unborn child, they are at great risk themselves. A new clinic was established in the region last year through a partnership between the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), Mandera county's local government and Philips. ""Maternal and newborn health outcomes in Kenya's remote six counties contribute nearly 50% to all maternal deaths in Kenya and we want to stop that with centres such as these,"" says Dr Ademola Olajide of UNFPA. The remoteness of these regions means that portable health monitoring technologies with mobile connectivity are proving invaluable to local volunteers, who can now access knowledge and advice from experts far away. Will we ever be able to trust driverless cars? Firms buy insurance 'in mad panic' as cyber-attacks soar Could these apps help you lose weight for good this year? Is this the year 'weaponised' AI bots do battle? For example, in Ghana, the Ghana Health Service and Novartis Foundation are co-operating to develop a nationwide ""telemedicine"" programme by 2019. Community health workers can access specialists - doctors, nurses and midwives - through a 24-hour teleconsultation centre. It began as a pilot in a remote part of the Ashanti region in 2011, covering 30 communities of around 35,000 people. Now Novartis says there are enough teleconsultation centres to serve the entire country. In another example, Uganda's MamaOpe has developed a Smart Vest application for the diagnosis and continuous monitoring of pneumonia in young children. The disease can often be misdiagnosed as malaria. Health workers in Ghana can access expert advice over the phone when helping patients In a matter of minutes, the data collected is sent to doctors who can make a diagnosis quickly and cheaply. And smartphones are being used a diagnostic tools in their own right, testing for hearing loss, for example. The 'invisible epidemic' afflicting millions globally Plugged in to services such as IBM's supercomputer Watson, with its ability to absorb vast swathes of clinical and social data and come up with likely prognoses, they are giving local community health workers access to knowledge they would never previously have had. But while such technology may be impressive, it would of little use without the heroic efforts of volunteer health workers such as Margaret Wairimu Maina. Her work isn't always easy, she admits. ""Sometimes I find it very difficult emotionally to go into the community and interact with people who are very underprivileged, with little or no resources,"" she says. ""But that is what I must do, and it makes me feel happy to be useful and known in the community.""

"The UK economy expanded by a better-than-expected 0.5% in the last three months of 2017, official figures say. Economists had expected a 0.4% expansion in the three months to December. However, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the broader picture was ""slower and more uneven"" growth. In 2017 as a whole, growth was 1.8% compared with 1.9% in 2016 - the slowest since 2012, the ONS said. The services sector, which accounts for the bulk of the economy, expanded by 0.6% in the fourth quarter - stronger than the 0.4% rise in the three months to September. ""The boost to the economy at the end of the year came from a range of services including recruitment agencies, letting agents and office management,"" said Darren Morgan, head of GDP at the ONS. Carney calls for 'deeper relationship' with Europe Mortgage approvals at five-year low Yet consumer-facing parts of the services sector, which include distribution, hotels, catering, transport and communications, posted much slower growth, he said. Manufacturing also grew strongly, but construction contracted by 1% - its third consecutive fall and worst quarterly performance since the third quarter of 2012. John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, said construction appeared to be the sector most affected by Brexit-related uncertainty, deterring commercial property investment and dampening the housing market, particularly in London. Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Macroeconomics said the ""undeniably strong"" quarterly figures increased the chance of the Monetary Policy Committee raising interest rates again as soon as this summer. However, Hargreaves Lansdown senior economist Ben Brettell described growth as anaemic and doubted there would be more than one rate rise this year, ""probably in the autumn"". Sterling jumped 0.8% to $1.4253 following the release of the GDP figures. Choose your comparator. You might, like Bank of England governor Mark Carney, point out that the economy is about 1% smaller than the Bank predicted it would be before the Brexit vote. But that was in the event of a ""stay"" vote. Pro-Brexit critics might point out the economy is doing a lot better than his own warnings about the risk of a ""technical recession"" if the UK voted to leave. Annual growth of 1.8% may be less than we would like, but so far there is little sign of the Brexit-induced disaster that some predicted.

"It's the first time in almost 20 years a sitting US president has come to Davos Donald Trump's visit to the World Economic Forum in Davos was billed as a showdown between the sophisticated ""global elites"" who attend in droves, and the baseball-cap wearing president's brash ""America First"" rhetoric. Yet mention his name in the bustling foyer of the Congress Centre, and the reaction is surprisingly benign. Many attendees shrug indifferently, rather than launch into an angry rant. Gabrielle Bacon says she is more interested in Europe's politicians' statements Gabrielle Bacon, who lives in the US, says she gets to listen to President Trump a lot at home, and is not remotely excited about his Davos appearance. Her main interest is in the European leaders who have spoken here, such as French President Emmanuel Macron and Italy's Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni. More from the BBC's Davos coverage She predicts, however, that his speech may not go down well, saying that President Trump is sometimes misunderstood in Europe. ""He doesn't talk in the same way as the European leaders and I think that's very confusing to people,"" she explains. Keen to clarify that she's not defending Donald Trump, Mrs Bacon says that his much-touted ""America First"" message is seen by some in the US as wanting the best for citizens there, but it doesn't mean that he doesn't want good things for other countries too. Nonetheless, she's glad he's come: ""Every leader should have their shot up there"". Hindou Oumarou Ibrahim says she won't '""waste my time"" thinking about President Trump Hindou Oumarou Ibrahim, co-ordinator for the Association for Indigenous Women and Peoples of Chad, thinks the president's visit is drawing attention away from more respected attendees. ""Personally, I'm not a fan, I am not going to be here to listen to what he is going to say,"" she says. ""What Justin [Trudeau] and Macron and the president of WEF said, those are the words of politicians who resonated in my head, and who are are calling on people to collaborate, to come together, to respect women's rights, to change the economy, to respect the environment - what is [Trump] going to say that is better than what they said?"" Ms Ibrahim, who first came to Davos a year ago, says Donald Trump's profanity-laden comments about immigrants from countries like hers have not been forgotten. ""I am still shocked by what he said last week about African and Caribbean countries,"" she says. ""I don't want to waste my time or energy thinking about [Trump]"" Some delegates are reluctant to put their views of Trump's visit on record, and privately have reservations about whether his arrival, along with the biggest ever US government delegation in WEF's 48-year history, will achieve much beyond generating headlines. ""I think it's very good that he's coming, because he has to be exposed to what is going on in the world,"" says one Israeli financier. Not that the exposure will mean much, he adds. ""He's driven by something else,"" the man, on his fourth trip to WEF, says. ""He's coming to calm down the world, but then somebody will [annoy] him the day after tomorrow, and he will tweet it all around the world, and that's it."" Donald Trump has extended a hand to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whom he met at Davos, by promising to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, recognising the latter as Israel's capital. But the Israeli delegate we spoke to thinks this move is counter-productive, especially for those representing his country on the ""Magic Mountain"". ""It will not help in our relations with the Palestinians, and we are coming here to build it up, we want to talk, we want to get a solution."" Layla Dong says Davos is open to everyone, whether Donald Trump or Kim Jong-un Chinese delegate Layla Dong, is adamant that inviting Donald Trump to Davos was the right thing to do. ""It's an open platform, we will welcome him because he's the president of the United States,"" she explains. ""The Forum is all about being a platform for people to communicate, so we are open to everybody, and if one day, the leader of North Korea wants to come to the Forum, they should also be welcomed"". Yet Ms Dong, who has been coming to Davos for three years, is sceptical about whether Mr Trump will say much worthy of note. On her phone, she points to a response to Trump's tweet on Thursday, announcing that he was heading to Davos to ""tell the world how great America is and is doing."" The riposte reads: ""It's only a few days after your first government shutdown, and you're going to Switzerland to lecture other countries on how they run their governments. You're funny."" ""I agree with this guy,"" she says. Andrea Bandelli hopes Mr Trump's visit will be ""constructive rather than destructive"" Andrea Bandelli is chief executive of Science Gallery International, a group which works to engage young people with science. He isn't planning to listen to President Trump due to other meetings that clash with the speech. But he's still glad that Mr Trump decided to come, saying the whole point of the World Economic Forum is that everybody should be invited. For all attendees here, he says, how much they get out of it depends on how well they listen and how much empathy they have. His hope is that President Trump's visit will be ""a constructive one rather than a destructive one"". Mr Bandelli notes that the point of the Forum is to bring everyone together, and that ""no one comes here with a reason that is higher than anybody else's"". ""We're all equal here and that's how we are treated,"" he says. But might President Trump, who is not known for his humility, find that rather difficult? ""There is always a chance that everybody is changed for the better after attending the annual meeting,"" he quips.

"This video can not be played Pub bombings campaigner Julie Hambleton praises the High Court ruling A coroner was wrong to restrict the scope of inquests into the Birmingham pub bombings, a court has ruled. In July, coroner Sir Peter Thornton QC decided the names of the alleged perpetrators would not be part of the framework of new inquests. But at the High Court on Friday, Mrs Justice Sue Carr said ""we will quash the coroner's decision"". Twenty-one people died whentwo bombs were detonated in the city centre in 1974. Midlands Live: Man 'murdered after trivial altercation'; Nothing found in 1991 missing mum hunt Sir Peter has been ordered to reconsider his decision to restrict the scope of the inquests following a judicial review heard by two High Court judges. In the latest ruling, Mrs Justice Carr and Lord Justice Simon, said: ""We are minded to quash the coroner's decision which excluded the perpetrator issue and remit the case so as to enable him to reconsider the decision."" Twenty-one people died when two bombs were detonated in Birmingham in 1974 Following the hearing, a spokesman for the inquests said: ""The coroner is committed to ensuring that the inquests start as soon as possible but now wishes to take some time to consider carefully the judgment handed by the High Court and its impact on the future progress of the inquests. ""The coroner is grateful for the considerable help and assistance he has had from all interested persons in the inquests to date"" A further pre-inquest review hearing is listed for 22 February. Hearings were held days after the bombings but closed without any evidence being heard Speaking outside Birmingham Civil Justice Centre, Julie Hambleton, whose sister Maxine died in the bombings, said the ruling was ""a very positive move forward"" and called it ""one of common sense"". She said: ""We would like to thank Lord Justice Simon and Mrs Justice Carr for hearing our appeal and for asking the coroner to go away and ask himself another question and that question is 'who murdered our loved ones?' ""We truly hope that the coroner will now reconsider and realise that without the perpetrators in scope, the inquest will make a mockery of our justice system."" BBC Midlands correspondent Phil Mackie, who was at the hearing, said the families of the victims are still angry at having to pay for legal help to get the names released, after being refused legal aid. They have been fundraising to pay for the judicial review, which cost Â£40,000. The families of the victims have fought for years to have inquests reopened Justice4the21, the main campaign group representing many of the relatives, said they would ""no longer participate"" in the hearings following the coroner's decision last year. Relatives had argued the inquests could not take place without naming suspects, while their lawyers said discussing potential perpetrators ""is central to the case"". The victims' families have fought for years to have the inquests reopened. Hearings were held days after the bombings but closed without hearing any evidence. Previously, self-confessed IRA bomb maker Michael Hayes said he was part of the group responsible for the Birmingham pub bombings.

"The 17 UKIP members in Thurrock who have resigned from the party and formed their own new group All 17 UKIP councillors in Thurrock - including an MEP - have resigned from the party and formed a new group. Thurrock Independents has been created by the councillors who said they ""have had enough of the aggressive and bitter reality of party politics"". The group, which includes MEP Tim Aker, is now the official opposition to the Conservative majority at Thurrock. A UKIP spokesman said he hoped the group would ""continue to serve their constituents as well as they have"". Graham Snell said Thurrock Independents' new logo represents the ""ethos"" of the party Graham Snell, leader of the Thurrock Independents, said the party would only stand in local elections and would have candidates in every ward during the 2018 local elections. ""Our mission is to maximise the quality of life of all Thurrock residents not gain power for power's sake,"" he said. Mr Snell added: ""Our councillors have won widespread admiration for their hard work even from residents across the political spectrum. We hope that these admirers will now be able to support Thurrock Independents. ""Our logo represents the ethos of our party, hard graft, working together towards common goals, sacrifice and the importance of the protection of our environment."" The resignations come in a week when UKIP leader Henry Bolton insisted he would not resign despite a no confidence vote from UKIP's national executive committee. A number of senior figures have quit their roles, including Mr Bolton's deputy and assistant deputy, following the end of Mr Bolton's relationship with girlfriend Jo Marney, after she reportedly made racist comments about Meghan Markle.

"Molly McLaren met Joshua Stimpson on dating app Tinder A woman stabbed to death by her ex-boyfriend had at least 75 wounds to her neck, head and body, a jury heard. Molly McLaren, 23, was killed in a ""frenzied"" attack in her car at the Dockside shopping centre in Chatham, Kent, on 29 June. Joshua Stimpson, 26,has admitted manslaughterbut denies murder. Pathologist Dr Olaf Biedrzycki told Maidstone Crown Court Ms McLaren would have lost consciousness ""within seconds"". The jury also heard from a witness who said he tried to disrupt the knife attack by slamming Stimpson's leg in the car door. Benjamin Morton described to the court how he noticed a struggle inside the car and soon became aware ""it wasn't just a fight"" as the man ""seemed to have something in his hand"". He said: ""She was trying to defend herself at that point. He was clearly attacking her and she had her hands up to try to stop him."" After noticing blood in the car he called out across the car park for help and ""banged on the window, on the bonnet"" in a bid to distract Stimpson. The jury was told when the witness saw Stimpson trying to cut Ms McLaren's throat he moved to the driver's side of the car where his leg was sticking out and tried to slam the door on it. ""I grabbed his leg to see if I could pull him. His leg was covered in blood. I stepped back and looked inside the car. ""I could see her throat had been cut. He seemed determined to make sure she was dead."" When he realised Ms McLaren would not survive the attack he tried to prevent Stimpson from getting away. He then got his car and blocked Ms McLaren's car in until the police arrived, the court was told. Stimpson denies murder on the grounds of diminished responsibility. The trial continues.

The interview, held in Davos, will be broadcast on 28 January at 22:00 GMT. The president's sharing of the controversial videos to his 40 million followers sparked aTwitter row with the UK prime minister, who criticised the move. ""I'm very clear that retweeting from Britain First was the wrong thing to do,"" Mrs May said, prompting Mr Trump to instruct the PM to focus on ""terrorism"" in the UK instead. Asked if he regretted the tweets, Mr Trump said, ""it was done because I am a big believer in fighting radical Islamic terror"". But he insisted he knew ""nothing about"" Britain First before sharing posts by the group's deputy leader Jayda Fransen - who isfacing a trial in April, accused of using threatening, abusive or insulting words at a protest in Belfast last year. ""I know nothing about them, I don't want to be involved with people [like that],"" Mr Trump told Morgan. Who has Trump criticised on Twitter? Davos shrugs off President Trump's visit Trump and his social media 'filter bubble' One of the videos retweeted by Mr Trump shows unverified footage of a ""Muslim migrant"" attacking a young Dutch man on crutches, with another showing a man smashing a statue of the Virgin Mary. The third video, originating from riots that took place in Egypt in 2013, shows a man being pushed from the top of a building. Mr Trump told Morgan: ""Here's what's fair - if you're telling me they're horrible people, horrible racist people, I would certainly apologise if you'd like me to do that."" He also said the controversy was not a big story in the US. This video can not be played May: We're not afraid to say when US has got it wrong Britain First, which was set up in 2011 by former members of the far-right British National Party (BNP), uses social media to gain attention for what it calls the ""Islamification of the UK"". Responding to Mr Trump's interview, Ms Fransen said she believed he had been ""railroaded"" into offering to apologise. She said: ""The fact is Donald Trump retweeted those because they are a matter of national and worldwide security. ""Islamic terrorism is affecting us all and he's been railroaded into saying he would offer an apology."" Ms Fransen said if she was really a ""horrible, nasty racist"" the US president ""would condemn me"". But she added: ""It's not true."" Speaking to ITV after the interview, Morgan said it was ""right and proper"" that Mr Trump should apologise, adding: ""I think this is a significant climbdown by the president"". The pair have been amiable since Morgan, who has described the president as a ""good friend"", won the US reality show Celebrity Apprentice in 2008 - which was judged by Mr Trump. Brendan Cox, whose wife Jo Cox was murdered by an extremist who shouted ""Britain First"" as he fired his gun, praised Morgan for pushing for an apology. ""Not many have succeeded in getting one,"" said Mr Cox, who was among those who rebuked Mr Trump for promoting the far-right group. Allow Twitter content?

During the interview, on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum, Mr Trump also told Morgan that he did not want to ""cause any difficulty for your country"". He spoke of his ""love"" for the UK and for Scotland in particular, which he described as a ""very special place"", despitecancelling a planned visit to the UK in February. Asked about whether some people were opposed to a UK visit, Mr Trump said: ""I hadn't heard about banning, I think a lot of the people in your country like what I stand for, [including] tough borders."" Mr Trump added that he had a ""very good relationship"" with the UK prime minister, who he met in Davos shortly before the interview on Thursday. ""A lot of people think we don't,"" he said. In anearlier exchange with the PM in Davos, Switzerland, President Trump told Mrs May: ""We love your country."" He also said the US and UK were ""joined at the hip"" on military matters, while Mrs May said they stood ""shoulder to shoulder"" in facing shared threats.

"This video can not be played What we learned from Donald Trump's Davos speech President Donald Trump has told global finance leaders he will always put the US first when it comes to trade, but ""that does not mean America alone"". ""The US is open for business,"" he said in his inaugural address to the World Economic Forum in Davos on Friday. But he continued to attack ""predatory"" trade practices, warning partners that the US would not tolerate unfair trade. Mr Trump's election campaign centred on America First, aiming to protect local manufacturers from foreign competition. This policy appeared to contradict the Davos conference's goal of promoting globalisation and co-operation. Kamal Ahmed: Trump 2.0 on trade Can Trump claim credit for bonus rush? Davos divided over Trump Davos jargon: A crime against the English language? Mr Trump lauded the economic achievements of his first year in office, including cutting corporation tax and lowering the unemployment rate, and said the US was more attractive than ever to foreign investment. ""I'm here to deliver a simple message - there has never been a better time to hire, to build, to invest and to grow in the United States. America is open for business and we are competitive once again,"" he said. Taking credit for the strong economy in the US, he urged foreign investors to ""bring your money, your jobs, your businesses to America"". As he was speaking,latest figures for US economic growth were released, showing a slowdown in growth from 3.2% to 2.6% in the final quarter of last year.This meant annual growth for 2017 was 2.3%, up from 1.5% in 2016 but below the president's 3% target. By Kamal Ahmed, BBC economics editor ""America First, not America alone."" It was the key line of the speech, and a message echoed by other leading members of the White House power pack here. This is all about trade and the US approach. The fear was that America under Mr Trump would throw up a series of trade barriers, increasing protectionism at a time when most government leaders at Davos - Narendra Modi of India, Justin Trudeau of Canada and Emmanuel Macron of France - were preaching the gospel of globalisation. But today we heard a more nuanced manifesto. America, Mr Trump said, did not want a trade war, it wanted fair trade. Which may come as a surprise to countries like South Korea, smarting this week following the imposition of tariffs on US imports of solar panels and washing machines. Read more from Kamal The US president demanded a reformed international trade system that was ""fair and reciprocal"" and accused unidentified countries of unfair practices, including ""massive intellectual property theft"" and providing state aid to industry. Mr Trump also said he preferred bilateral fair trade agreements with other countries, including those signed up to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) from which he has withdrawn. He said he would consider negotiating with TPP states collectively, if it was in America's interest. He later tweeted that his speech had been well received. Allow Twitter content?

But some attendees booed when he attacked the media and repeated accusations of them reporting ""fake news"" in a question and answer session after his address. ""As a businessman I was always treated really well by the pressâ¦ and it wasn't until I became a politician that I realised how nasty, how mean, how vicious and how fake the press can be,"" he said. The BBC's Katie Hope, who attended the speech, says anticipation was high but the audience's response was rather muted with some expecting a more conciliatory tone. Donald Trump's speech was eagerly anticipated Despite this, Mr Trump has had an overwhelmingly positive reception, with cheers on his arrival on Thursday in the main Congress Centre. In a meeting with UK Prime Minister Theresa May the same day, he said he expected ""a tremendous increase"" in trade between the US and Britain in the coming years. He has also saidhe is prepared to apologise for retweeting posts from a British far-right group last November, a move that sparked a Twitter row with Mrs May. In an interview Mr Trump told ITV's Piers Morgan: ""If you are telling me they're horrible people, horrible, racist people, I would certainly apologise if you'd like me to do that."" President Trump's speech comes days afterthe US announced new tariffs of up to 50% on imported washing machines and solar panels, prompting an outcry from China and South Korea - the primary targets of the measure.

"Theresa May and Donald Trump meeting at the UN General Assembly Donald Trump has told Prime Minister Theresa May to focus on ""terrorism"" in the UK after she criticised his sharing of far-right videos. ""Don't focus on me, focus on the destructive Radical Islamic Terrorism that is taking place within the United Kingdom,"" Mr Trump tweeted. The US president had earlier retweeted three inflammatory videos posted online by a British far-right group. Mrs May's spokesmansaid it was ""wrong for the president to have done this"". The US and the UK are close allies and often described as having a ""special relationship"". Theresa May was the first foreign leader to visit the Trump White House. The speaker of the House of Commons has granted a request for an urgent question on the matter from Labour MP Stephen Doughty. Allow Twitter content?

MPs have been reacting to the tweet, with Work and Pensions Secretary David Gauke backing Mrs May and calling Britain First a ""ghastly, obnoxious organisation"". But while Education Secretary Justine Greening said she disagreed with Mr Trump's actions, they should not be allowed to damage the special relationship between the two countries. The videos shared by Mr Trump, who has more than 40 million followers, were initially posted by Jayda Fransen, the deputy leader of Britain First, a group founded by former members of the far-right British National Party (BNP). Ms Fransen, 31, has been charged in the UK with using ""threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour"" over speeches she made at a rally in Belfast. Several leading UK politicians have criticised the president for retweeting her posts, as has the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, who said it was ""deeply disturbing"" that Mr Trump had ""chosen to amplify the voice of far-right extremists"". What the videos Trump shared actually show Why is Britain First big online? And it has led to renewed calls for Mr Trump's planned state visit to the UK to be cancelled, although Downing Street said on Wednesday that the invitation still stood. London Mayor Sadiq Khan, who has previously called for the ""ill-judged"" trip to be cancelled, said:  ""It beggars belief that the president of our closest ally doesn't see that his support of this extremist group actively undermines the values of tolerance and diversity that makes Britain so great. ""After this latest incident, it is increasingly clear that any official visit at all from President Trump to Britain would not be welcomed."" In hitting out at Mrs May, Mr Trump first tagged the wrong Twitter account, sending his statement to a different user with just six followers. He then deleted the tweet and posted it again, this time directing the message to the UK PM's official account. After already condemning Mr Trump's actions on Wednesday, Brendan Cox - whose wife, MP Jo Cox, was murdered by a right-wing extremist who shouted ""Britain first"" before committing the act - told the US president to focus on problems in his own country.

TV presenter and journalist Piers Morgan, who has supported Mr Trump in the past, said the president ""owes our prime minister an apology, not a lecture"" after he ""publicly endorsed the most extreme bunch of Islamophobe fascists in Britain"". But American conservative commentator Ann Coulter - who is one of the 45 people followed on Twitter by Mr Trump and retweeted the videos first - defended her president's words to Mrs May, saying he had ""only given as good as he gets"". This video can not be played Ann Coulter defends the US president on Today after he hit out at Theresa May over far-right tweets By Anthony Zurcher, North America reporter It's clear at this point that Donald Trump won't let a perceived slight or criticism go unanswered - even if it's from a supposed friend. Even if it's from the leader of the president's closest international ally. So shock isn't exactly the right word to describe the reaction to Mr Trump's initially botched attempt to tell Theresa May to, in effect, mind her own business. This is just another example of the US president's self-described ""modern-day presidential"" use of social media, where Twitter is a cudgel for score-settling no matter the diplomatic cost. When Mr Trump assumed the presidency, one of the first foreign dignitaries he received was Mrs May, and it appeared they formed a quick bond -briefly holding hands as they walked past the White House Rose Garden. Those bonds will now be tested in a spat over a few morning retweets of inflammatory videos. It's a wholly unnecessary controversy, but the international consequences could be all too real. Read more from Anthony The first video purportedly shows a ""Muslim migrant"" attacking a young Dutch man on crutches. However, the claim in this tweet appears to have little substance. A spokesperson from the Dutch Public Prosecution Service told the BBC that the person arrested for the attack ""was born and raised in the Netherlands"" and was not a migrant. The Dutch embassy in Washington DC confirmed this on Twitter. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The second video retweeted by Mr Trump shows a man smashing a statue of the Virgin Mary. This video was uploaded to YouTube in 2013. The man in the clip says: ""No-one but Allah will be worshipped in the land of the Levant,"" which could place him in Syria.

Republican Senator John McCain said he was ""surprised"" at the president's tweets.

"This video can not be played Davis: No difference over Brexit aims David Davis has said there is ""no difference"" between him, the chancellor and prime minister following a Tory row over the terms of a Brexit transition. The Brexit Secretary said all three wanted the UK's exit from the EU in March 2019 to ""serve the British economy... and the British people"". There was a ""diversity of views"" in all parties and EU member states, he said. Backbench Tories had criticised Philip Hammond for saying that changes to UK-EU relations could be ""very modest"". No 10 distanced itself from Mr Hammond's remarks and one Tory MP said he should ""stick to the script"" the PM had laid out. Following a speech outlining some of his ambitions for an ""implementation period"" immediately after the UK leaves the EU in March 2019, Mr Davis was asked about the row. Laura Kuenssberg: Tories' Brexit agonies resurface Rees-Mogg and Hammond at odds over Brexit The key Brexit dates in 2018 He said: ""I'm in politics, people debate and  they have different views and there is a diversity of views on this subject in all parties. That doesn't mean we can't have a coherent and forceful view in the interests of the United Kingdom."" He added: ""There is no difference between the chancellor, and myself - and indeed the prime minister - in terms that we both want a Brexit which serves the British economy and which serves the British people. There will be arguments about the tactics but they will change - the options available to us will change throughout the negotiations. ""We want a good Brexit for British business and a good Brexit for the British people and we will deliver that on a frictionless access to the single market and political and economic freedom for us in the future."" In his speech, Mr Davis said that the UK would be able to sign new trade deals in the ""implementation"" period - thought likely to last up to two years. The UK would still effectively follow the rules of the EU customs union for the period immediately after Brexit and no trade deals could come into force until it ended. But he said: ""As an independent country - no longer a member of the European Union - the United Kingdom will once again have its own trading policy. This video can not be played Hammond: I want maximum access to EU markets ""For the first time in more than 40 years, we will be able to step out and sign new trade deals with old friends, and new allies, around the globe."" He said existing international agreements - which include trade deals with other countries and agreements on aviation and nuclear power - should continue to apply during the period. The ""immediate goal"" in negotiations, he added, would be to secure political agreement on an implementation phase by March's European Council summit. Analysis by BBC Reality Check correspondent Chris Morris This speech comes three days before the other EU member states are due to publish their formal guidelines (their terms and conditions in other words) for negotiations on the nature of a transition period after Brexit. Those negotiations are due to begin shortly, and Mr Davis is getting his response in first, as well as trying to address some of the political heat he's now feeling from Brexiteers. That's why he used the term 'implementation' rather than 'transition' period throughout his speech - it suggests that the UK will be implementing the consequences of Brexit. EU documents though always refer to a transition because other countries are convinced that negotiations on the future EU-UK relationship will not have been completed by the time the UK leaves. As well as smoothing the path for business, they argue that a transition is necessary to allow negotiations on future relations to continue. Failing to reach agreement would mean uncertainty for businesses, resulting in delayed investment and a ""stifling of hard-won economic growth"". Mr Davis also stressed the need for an ""appropriate process"" to allow the UK to resolve any concerns about new EU laws introduced during the implementation phase which were against its interests. The speech comes amida row in his partyover the government's approach to Brexit negotiations, following Mr Hammond's comments at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday. Downing Street distanced itself from his remarks although the prime minister's spokesman said on Friday she had full confidence in the chancellor. Asked whether his comments had been destabilising for the prime minister, Mr Hammond told the BBC: ""I think the context is important. I was speaking about our trade relationship with the EU, and it is the government's policy that we want to maintain the maximum possible access to markets and the minimum friction at our borders because that's good for the British economy."" But Eurosceptic Tory backbencher Bernard Jenkin told the BBC it would be easier for the PM if Mr Hammond and other cabinet ministers ""stuck to her script"" while Jacob Rees-Mogg said Mr Hammond ""must have been affected by high mountain air"" in the Swiss resort. In response to Mr Davis's speech, Hilary Benn, Labour chairman of the Commons Brexit committee, said ""what we really needed to hear is what the government's proposals are for the most important trade negotiation of all - with the European Union... On that, we are none the wiser"" And Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer said nothing Mr Davis had said ""can mask or hide the bitter infighting that is going on in the government about what form Brexit should take"".

"""Nutella arouses your enthusiasm,"" the slogan on the pot reads A discount on Nutella has led to violent scenes in a chain of French supermarkets, as shoppers jostled to grab a bargain on the sweet spread. IntermarchÃ© supermarkets offered a 70% discount on Nutella, bringing the price down from â¬4.50 (Â£3.90) to â¬1.40. But police were called when people began fighting and pushing one another. ""They are like animals. A woman had her hair pulled, an elderly lady took a box on her head, another had a bloody hand,"" one customer told French media. A member of staff at one IntermarchÃ© shop in central France told the regional newspaper Le ProgrÃ¨s: ""We were trying to get in between the customers but they were pushing us.""

"This video can not be played Firefighters tackle the blaze in Miryang At least 37 people have been killed and about 130 injured in a fire at a hospital in South Korea. The blaze is thought to have started in the emergency room at Sejong Hospital in the south-eastern city of Miryang. Nearly 200 patients were inside the building and an adjoining nursing home when the fire broke out in the morning. It is South Korea's deadliest fire in almost a decade and the death toll is expected to rise with several of the injured in critical condition. Firefighters said the victims appeared to have died from smoke inhalation. Three hospital medical staff - a doctor, nurse and nursing assistant - are among the victims. Authorities have given varying death tolls, with police earlier saying 41 had died. But the officials later corrected this, saying some victims were counted twice. The fire completely gutted the hospital's first floor, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reports. Miryang is about 270km (168 miles) south-east of the capital, Seoul. The hospital specialised in caring for elderly people with long-term needs, as well as other patients, reported the daily JoongAng Ilbo - and reports suggest many patients would have been too ill or old to escape alone. The fire completely gutted the hospital's ground floor Many of those inside the burning building were elderly The paper quoted a surviving patient, Jang Yeong-jae, as saying that he was on the second floor when nurses screamed ""Fire!"" in the hallway and urged people to evacuate. ""But when I opened the exit door, the whole stairway was filled with dark smoke and I couldn't see a thing,"" he said. ""Everybody was running around in panic, falling over and screaming as smoke filled the rooms."" Mr Jang said he ripped open window screens and escaped down a ladder put up by firefighters. ""There were so many elderly patients on other floors... I wonder if they escaped safely,"" Mr Jang's wife was quoted as saying. Fire chief Choi Man-woo told reporters the cause of the fire was not yet known. The hospital building did not have any fire sprinklers installed, local media said. Under current laws, the building was not required to have sprinklers, but they were in the process of being fitted in the adjoining nursing home. A new law that is due to come into force on 30 June will make sprinklers compulsory for nursing homes. Most of the casualties were due to smoke inhalation Mr Choi said the fire started around 07:30 local time (22:30 GMT on Thursday) and was put out in about three hours. Ninety-four patients from the adjacent nursing home were safely evacuated. South Korean President Moon Jae-in arranged an emergency meeting to discuss ways of dealing with the fire. Senior officials from both governing and opposition parties travelled to Miryang to offer their condolences and call for a thorough investigation. It is not known what caused the fire Scores of patients were inside the building and a neighbouring nursing home The hospital has been operating since 2008 and about 35 medical staff work there, according to provincial officials. The fire comes just a month after29 people in the South Korean city of Jecheon were killedin a blaze at a public gym. The owner and manager of the building were later arrested over multiple safety lapses, including malfunctioning sprinkler systems.

Shares in Wynn Resorts, a hotel and casino group, have dived 10% after a Wall Street Journal report accused boss Steve Wynn of sexual misconduct. The Journal said a dozen current and former employees ""told of behavior that cumulatively would amount to a decades-long pattern of sexual misconduct"". Some described being pressured into performing sex acts with him, it said. Responding to the claims, Mr Wynn said: ""The idea that I ever assaulted any woman is preposterous."" The UK's aerospace trade body ADS says the Bombardier ruling is positive news for the UK. If the US had won the case, the tariffs imposed could have led to job losses at Bombardier's factory in Belfast, it said. Chief executive Paul Everitt said: âThis judgement from the
US International Trade Commission is positive news that will be warmly welcomed
by Bombardier, its workforce in Belfast and the whole supply chain of companies
in the UK and Ireland. âAerospace is a
competitive and growing sector, and it is important that customers should be
given access to the best technology and the most innovative products. âIt is great to see the commission has upheld the evidence put forward by Bombardier and by governments
in the UK and Canada. âWe look forward to
examining the details of the judgement when they are made available to
understand its full implications."" It was Boeing who brought this case, arguing that Bombardier was not competing on a level playing field. In a statement, it said: ""We are disappointed that the International Trade
Commission did not recognise the harm that Boeing has suffered from the
billions of dollars in illegal government subsidies that the Department of Commerce
found Bombardier received and used to dump aircraft in the US small
single-aisle airplane market. ""Those violations have harmed the US aerospace
industry, and we are feeling the effects of those unfair business practices in
the market every day. âWhile we disagree with the ITCâs conclusion today, we
will review the Commissionâs more detailed opinions in full as they are
released in the coming days."" ""Todayâs decision is a victory for innovation,
competition, and the rule of law. It is also a victory for US airlines and
the US traveling public. The C Series is the most innovative and efficient
new aircraft in a generation. Its development and production represent
thousands of jobs in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. ""We are
extremely proud of our employees, investors and suppliers who have worked
together to bring this remarkable aircraft to the market. With this matter
behind us, we are moving full speed ahead with finalising our partnership with
Airbus. ""Integration planning is going well and we look forward to delivering
the C Series to the US market so that US airlines and the US flying
public can enjoy the many benefits of this remarkable aircraft."" Canada's Bombardier
has won an unexpected trade victory against
US planemaker Boeing, after a US agency rejected
imposing hefty duties on sales of Bombardier's new CSeries jet
to American carriers. The US International Trade Commission voted 4-0 to reject
Boeing's claims that it suffered injury in the case, and
discarded a Commerce Department recommendation to slap a near
300% duty on sales of the 110-to-130-seat CSeries jets
for five years. The ITC had widely been expected to side with Chicago-based
Boeing, the world's largest maker of jetliners, which accused
Bombardier of selling the planes below cost in
the US market. BBC technology of business editor tweets... Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Analysis by BBC Reality Check team Reality Check âThe stock market is
smashing one record after another, and has added more than $7 trillion in new
wealth since my election,â President Trump said at Davos. Last week US media
reported that the US stock market had added $6.9 trillion in value since Mr
Trumpâs election. The figure comes from Bespoke Investment Group, a US-based
market analysis company. They derived it using the
Russell 3000 index, which represents 98% of all US stocks. Mr Trump is right that stock markets have been hitting a
series of record highs recently. In fact, in 2017, the Dow Jones industrial
average broke the record for breaking records, with 71 new highs recorded. Itâs
already hit 10 record highs this January â and it set another when it opened on
Friday after Mr Trumpâs speech. The broader S&P index, which is a 500-stock index, has
performed similarly, hitting 62 highs in 2017. However, the degree to which Mr Trumpâs administration is
responsible for this is disputed. In the US, stock markets have benefited from low interest
rates, as well as excellent performance from individual companies like Boeing. Stock markets have rallied across the world over the last
year, so the US case is part of a global trend. In fact, since Mr Trumpâs
election, Japanese and European markets have rallied more than US ones. Analysis by BBC Reality Check team Reality Check President Trump used the speech at Davos
to highlight the good health of the American economy, and he made several claims about jobs and the stock
market. He said 2.4 million jobs have been created
since he won the election in November 2016, and based onBureau of Labour Statistics,externalfigures, heâs right. Latest figures for February to December
2017 suggest approximately
1.8 million new jobs have been created (not including the 11 days from his inauguration to 31 January). Thatâs fewer
than the same period in the last four years of the Obama
administration. Some people argue this could partly be because the labour market is at or close to so called full employment after consecutive months of growth. The
president also made claims about unemployment, which he said is at its lowest
rate âin so many decadesâ. According to the latest government figures,
unemployment stands at 4%, the lowest since December 2000. Mr Trump noted that unemployment among
African Americans and Hispanic Americans is at a record low. At 6.8%, it is
indeed the lowest for African Americans since 1972 when the Bureau of Labour
Statistics started collected data for different groups. For Hispanic Americans,
the rate was 4.9% in December, which, along with the 4.8% rate recorded the
month before, equals the lowest rate since records started. Low unemployment figures reflect a trend
that started under the Obama administration. Toy-makers are responding to the popularity of slime videos on YouTube with bucket-loads of DIY slime kits. One slime-making manufacturer at Toy Fair 2018 told the BBC's Rory Cellan-Jones that it wanted to get children ""off technology"" and having fun again. Allow Twitter content?

Earlier JD Wetherspoon cancelled its contract with the meat supplier Russell Hume. Chairman Tim Martin apologised to customers after it was forced to remove meat from its menu on Tuesday, leaving customers without rump, sirloin or gammon at the chainâs weekly steak night. He said: ""Our decision to stop serving steak from Tuesday 23 January, despite limited information from the supplier, was the correct one. Steak is one of the most popular dishes on our menu, and we serve around 200,000 per week on average, about half of these on our extremely popular Tuesday night steak club.â Jason Feeney, chief executive of the Food Standards Agency, says he recognises the impact of its investigation on businesses. Russell Hume has supplied pub groups such as Marston's, Hilton Hotels and Jamie's Italian, not to mention care homes and schools. Mr Feeney said: ""We do recognise the potential impact of our decisions on business and peoplesâ livelihoods. âOf course, public health remains our top priority and at no stage in the process has there been any indication that people have become ill from eating meat supplied by Russell Hume.  This remains the case and we continue to assess the situation working with the relevant public health bodies."" The FSA's statement doesn't contain much new news, which will irritate some who have argued it should be more transparent. It says: ""We are unable to provide further details which could potentially jeopardise future enforcement action."" It adds: ""As a result of these further investigations which highlighted the serious issues of non-compliance, Russell Hume have been required to stop all production at the plants and detain all products. ""We then worked with the company so that they could initiate a voluntary recall of all affected products. Until the business can provide assurances that they are complying with the relevant legislation and that they are producing safe food, no meat can leave their sites."" The Food Standards Authority has published a statement on its probe into food hygiene standards at meat supplier Russell Hume. It comes hours after pub group JD Wetherspoon said it had cancelled its contract with the firm. The FSA said its concerns were uncovered as the result of an unannounced audit at one site
which then led to a wider investigation. ""Based
on the evidence gathered we became concerned that there was a more systemic and
widespread problem which was more serious in terms of its scale and nature. ""It
was only at this stage issues of serious non-compliance were uncovered. These
related to a number of issues including concerns about procedures and processes
around use by dates."" French bank BNP Paribas has agreed to plead guilty and pay a $90m criminal fine in the US for conspiring to rig foreign currency markets. The bank's US arm admitted to having conspired to fix prices for Central and Eastern European, Middle Eastern and African currencies from September 2011 to July 2013. The US Justice Department said the conspiracy involved bogus trades, coordinated trading, and agreements on what prices to quote to specific customers. The French bank issued a statement saying: âBNP Paribas USA deeply regrets the past misconduct that led to this settlement, which was a clear breach of the high standards on which it operates.â The London market has closed up after UK GDP figures beat expectations. It ended Friday 0.7% higher at 7,665.54 points, in spite of a continued rally in the pound. Strong performers included BAE Systems which gained 3.8%, Imperial Brands, up 3.4% and Next, up 3%. Earlier official data showed the UK economy expanded by a better-than-expected 0.5% in the last three months of 2017.

Helen CattPolitical editor, BBC South East This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer, shadow Brexit secretary Why is everyone so worried about Dover? It really comes down to speed and space. Over the years, the Port has got more and more efficient so
drivers can arrive, get on a boat and get off in France with minimal
interruption. That means it can get large volumes  of traffic through,
very quickly, in an almost constant flow. The downside is that any interruption to that flow causes
delay and disruption. Which is where space comes in. The physical port is not
large; there's simply nowhere to put backed-up traffic so it spills out onto
surrounding roads. Hemmed in by cliffs, sea and the town itself, the port has
nowhere to expand. For a final problem, its speed means it's a favoured route
for perishable goods (like fruit or medicine) so delays don't have to be long
before they start causing serious issues for freight firms. Kamal AhmedEconomics editor Few people knew what to expect. Would this be belligerent Trump - wagging his finger at the global elite about how divorced they were from reality, from what people really want? Or would this be conciliatory Trump, setting a different tone? We heard the second. The president touched many of the World Economic Forum's erogenous zones.

"This video can not be played What we learned from Donald Trump's Davos speech President Donald Trump has told global finance leaders he will always put the US first when it comes to trade, but ""that does not mean America alone"". ""The US is open for business,"" he said in his inaugural address to the World Economic Forum in Davos on Friday. But he continued to attack ""predatory"" trade practices, warning partners that the US would not tolerate unfair trade. Mr Trump's election campaign centred on America First, aiming to protect local manufacturers from foreign competition. This policy appeared to contradict the Davos conference's goal of promoting globalisation and co-operation. Kamal Ahmed: Trump 2.0 on trade Can Trump claim credit for bonus rush? Davos divided over Trump Davos jargon: A crime against the English language? Mr Trump lauded the economic achievements of his first year in office, including cutting corporation tax and lowering the unemployment rate, and said the US was more attractive than ever to foreign investment. ""I'm here to deliver a simple message - there has never been a better time to hire, to build, to invest and to grow in the United States. America is open for business and we are competitive once again,"" he said. Taking credit for the strong economy in the US, he urged foreign investors to ""bring your money, your jobs, your businesses to America"".

"Left-right: Nicky Campbell, Huw Edwards, Jon Sopel, Jeremy Vine, Nick Robinson and John Humphrys Six of the BBC's leading male presenters have agreed to take pay cuts after revelations over equal salaries. The BBC said Huw Edwards, Nicky Campbell, John Humphrys, Jon Sopel, Nick Robinson and Jeremy Vine had all accepted reduced wages. The move follows Carrie Gracie'sresignation as BBC China editorin protest at unequal pay between male and female international editors. Humphrys said he would be earning ""hugely less"" than the Â£600,000 he was. The move comes after the BBCrevealed the pay of on-air talent earning over Â£150,000in July. Two-thirds of stars on the list, including the top seven earners, were men. This video can not be played John Humphrys says pay cut is 'fair' Humphrys, the presenter on Radio 4's flagship Today programme and Mastermind, was revealed to have earned between Â£600,000 and Â£649,999 in 2016/17. He refused to confirm or deny reports that his pay packet had been halved, to Â£250,000-Â£300,000, but did say his new salary would be ""a lot less than Â£600,000"". He said he had, in fact, taken a total of three pay cuts. ""It seemed fair,"" he told BBC News. ""The BBC used to have, in the good old days, an awful lot of money. ""It no longer has an awful lot of money. I was earning a lot of money and it seemed entirely proper to me that I should take a few pay cuts."" Of the six men, Radio 2 and Eggheads presenter Jeremy Vine was the best-paid of the group, earning between Â£700,000-Â£749,999 in 2016/17. Jon Sopel, the BBC's North America editor, earned the least, in the Â£200,000-Â£249,999 bracket - compared to Carrie Gracie's Â£135,000-a-year salary. The BBC did not comment how much the presenters would now receive. A BBC statement said: ""We are very grateful to Huw Edwards, Nicky Campbell, John Humphrys, Jon Sopel, Nick Robinson and Jeremy Vine, who have agreed that their pay will now be reduced. ""These are great journalists and presenters, who have a real connection with the audience. We are proud to have them working at the BBC. ""The final details of some of these changes are still being discussed, and there are further conversations that the BBC will have with others in due course."" Carrie Gracie published an open letter giving her reasons for resigning as China editor On his way into work at Radio 2 on Friday, Vine was asked by reporters why he had agreed to a lower wage. ""I think it needs to be sorted out and I support my female colleagues who have rightly said they should be paid the same when they're doing the same job,"" he said. ""It's just a no-brainer, so it wasn't a problem for me to accept one [a pay cut]."" An independent audit into equal pay at the BBC will be published next week. When the list of the best-paid BBC presenters that was published last summer, Chris Evans was at the top, earning between Â£2.2m and Â£2.25m in 2016/2017. The highest-paid woman, Claudia Winkleman, earned significantly less - between Â£450,000 and Â£500,000. BBC media editor Amol Rajan said while competition in the entertainment industry had intensified, the opposite had happened in news. ""Many of those now taking pay cuts secured generous deals years ago,"" he said. ""That world has disappeared - and these presenters now accept that a chunk of their salaries will have to disappear with it."" This video can not be played Jeremy Vine: Taking a pay cut is 'a no-brainer' After leaving her post as China editor, Gracie is now returning to the BBC newsroom in London, saying she expects to be ""paid equally"". She is due to appear before a select committee of MPs on Wednesday next week, shortly before director general of the BBC Tony Hall, his deputy Anne Bulford and director of news and current affairs Fran Unsworth. They were called to discuss what action the corporation is taking to address the gender pay gap. Damian Collins MP, chair of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee, said: ""While it is admirable that these BBC presenters want to show solidarity for their female colleagues by taking a pay cut, it doesn't address the fundamental issues of pay inequality that Carrie Gracie and others have raised."" He added that they would hear from Gracie and senior BBC figures at the committee session. There have been three investigations into gender pay at the BBC: A report was published in October, in line with a requirement on all large organisations. Itfound the gender pay gap at the BBC was 9.3%,external, against a national average of 18.1% A judge-led audit of equal pay among rank-and-file staff published at the same time found there was ""no question of any systemic gender discrimination"" A review into the BBC's approach to the pay of on-air presenters, editors and correspondents is due to be published next week Lord Hall pledged to close the gap by 2020, saying the corporation should be ""an exemplar of what can be achieved when it comes to pay, fairness, gender and representation"".

"This video can not be played Pub bombings campaigner Julie Hambleton praises the High Court ruling A coroner was wrong to restrict the scope of inquests into the Birmingham pub bombings, a court has ruled. In July, coroner Sir Peter Thornton QC decided the names of the alleged perpetrators would not be part of the framework of new inquests. But at the High Court on Friday, Mrs Justice Sue Carr said ""we will quash the coroner's decision"". Twenty-one people died whentwo bombs were detonated in the city centre in 1974. Midlands Live: Man 'murdered after trivial altercation'; Nothing found in 1991 missing mum hunt Sir Peter has been ordered to reconsider his decision to restrict the scope of the inquests following a judicial review heard by two High Court judges. In the latest ruling, Mrs Justice Carr and Lord Justice Simon, said: ""We are minded to quash the coroner's decision which excluded the perpetrator issue and remit the case so as to enable him to reconsider the decision."" Twenty-one people died when two bombs were detonated in Birmingham in 1974 Following the hearing, a spokesman for the inquests said: ""The coroner is committed to ensuring that the inquests start as soon as possible but now wishes to take some time to consider carefully the judgment handed by the High Court and its impact on the future progress of the inquests. ""The coroner is grateful for the considerable help and assistance he has had from all interested persons in the inquests to date"" A further pre-inquest review hearing is listed for 22 February. Hearings were held days after the bombings but closed without any evidence being heard Speaking outside Birmingham Civil Justice Centre, Julie Hambleton, whose sister Maxine died in the bombings, said the ruling was ""a very positive move forward"" and called it ""one of common sense"". She said: ""We would like to thank Lord Justice Simon and Mrs Justice Carr for hearing our appeal and for asking the coroner to go away and ask himself another question and that question is 'who murdered our loved ones?' ""We truly hope that the coroner will now reconsider and realise that without the perpetrators in scope, the inquest will make a mockery of our justice system."" BBC Midlands correspondent Phil Mackie, who was at the hearing, said the families of the victims are still angry at having to pay for legal help to get the names released, after being refused legal aid. They have been fundraising to pay for the judicial review, which cost Â£40,000. The families of the victims have fought for years to have inquests reopened Justice4the21, the main campaign group representing many of the relatives, said they would ""no longer participate"" in the hearings following the coroner's decision last year. Relatives had argued the inquests could not take place without naming suspects, while their lawyers said discussing potential perpetrators ""is central to the case"". The victims' families have fought for years to have the inquests reopened. Hearings were held days after the bombings but closed without hearing any evidence. Previously, self-confessed IRA bomb maker Michael Hayes said he was part of the group responsible for the Birmingham pub bombings. He told the BBC he defused a third explosive in Birminghamand accepts ""collective responsibility"" for all of the group's actions.

"The WikiLeaks founder has been living at the Ecuadorean embassy for more than five years Lawyers for Julian Assange are asking a London court to withdraw a UK warrant for his arrest, saying it has ""lost its purpose"". The warrant was issued in 2012 after he allegedly breached bail conditions by seeking asylum in Ecuador's London embassy. He had been facing extradition to Sweden to answer sex assault claims but these have since been dropped. The Crown Prosecution Service says Mr Assange could walk free if he succeeds. Before the start of court proceedings, Mr Assange's lawyer Gareth Pierce told reporters the warrant should have ""no status"" because the proceedings in Sweden had come to an end. Earlier this month the UK government refusedto grant the WikiLeaks founder diplomatic status and called on him to leave the embassy to ""face justice"". The offence of failing to surrender to bail carries a maximum penalty of one year in prison. The UK has refused to guarantee that Mr Assange will not be extradited to the US if he leaves the embassy. In April 2017, US attorney general Jeff Sessions said arresting Julian Assange for releasing classified US information was a ""priority"". A decision on the appeal is expected on 6 February.

"Six men were shot dead as they watched a football match in a pub in Loughinisland in 1994 A legal challenge to a Police Ombudsman's ruling of collusion in the Loughinisland killings will be reheard before a new judge. Six Catholic men were shot dead as they watched a World Cup match in the County Down village in 1994. The move was announced byMr Justice McCloskey, who had previously ruled that the Police Ombudsman's finding of collusion was ""unsustainable in law"". This video can not be played What happened in Loughinisland in June 1994? Lawyers for the ombudsman and victims' families had asked him to withdraw. Loughinisland: A night of terror Who is Mr Justice Bernard McCloskey? Loughinisland case 'unique and unprecedented' They argued there was a potential public perception of bias as he had previously been involved in a similar case against the Ombudsman's office. On Friday, Mr Justice McCloskey said the legal test for him to step aside had not been satisfied but that he would step aside anyway. One of two retired RUC officers who mounted the legal challenge to the ombudsman's finding of collusion said he appreciated the dilemma the judge faced and said he was relaxed about the decision. ""We accept what Judge McCloskey has had to stay, we have no fears in the whole issue being re-run again,"" former assistant chief constable Raymond White said. ""In fact, we are delighted that our issues in relation to the way the ombudsman's office has been operating for over a decade now have been taken seriously."" Emma Rogan, whose father Adrian was one of the six men killed, said she welcomed the announcement of a fresh hearing into the case. ""As the families, we respect the judge's decision to step aside and he is going to do that. This video can not be played Emma Rogan said the Loughinisland families will stick together ""We are delighted that our report still stands in its entirety - the report that we got in 2016 is still the report that's on record."" She added: ""All we ever wanted was the truth - that's it bottom line.  Everybody deserves it, it's human decency for people to know and for people to acknowledge what happened to their loved ones."" The families' solicitor, Niall Murphy, described it as ""the most unprecedented"" outcome to a judicial review he had ever seen. ""What we have now is an opportunity for the police ombudsman and the families, as interested parties, to re-engage in a brand new reflection of the legal issues raised and we look forward to doing that as quickly as possible,"" the lawyer said. This video can not be played Loughinisland solicitor says outcome is 'unprecedented' Mr Murphy added that the new hearing would be ""another stage in the process"" of a case which had raised very serious issues that ""give rise to public confidence in the administration of justice"". In his ruling, Mr Justice McCloskey said that the families of those killed at Loughinisland had ""become engulfed in a maelstrom"" of a legal system that has been ""far from straightforward"". Mr Justice Bernard McCloskey previously ruled in favour of two retired police officers who brought the case against the Ombudsman The judge said that ""our legal system will not have served the families well if they are not given the opportunity of having this case heard by a differently constituted court"". The men who died were Adrian Rogan, 34, Malcolm Jenkinson, 53, Barney Green, 87, Daniel McCreanor 59, Patrick O'Hare, 35, and Eamon Byrne, 39. Five others were wounded. Gunmen burst into the Heights Bar and opened fire Loyalist gunmen burst into the Heights Bar and opened fire on 18 June 1994 as they were watching the Republic of Ireland play Italy in the World Cup. No-one has ever been convicted over the attack. In June 2016,the police ombudsman found there had been collusion between some police officers and the UVF gunmen. No-one has ever been convicted over the attack Two police officers challenged the legal basis of the report and Mr Justice McCloskey found in their favour in December. Mr Justice McCloskey was due to announce if he would quash part or all of the report's findings last week but instead announced he would decide whether or not to step aside over a possible perception of bias. In 2001, when he was a barrister, Bernard McCloskey QC, was involved in an unsuccessful challenge to a report by former Police Ombudsman Nuala O'Loan which found there had been failings by the RUC during the investigation into the 1998 Omagh bombing. It had been previously claimed in court that Judge McCloskey, in his previous life as QC, had represented Raymond White in that legal challenge. The judge said this was not the case.

"Gavin Williamson said Russia could cause 'total chaos' in the UK Russia could cause ""thousands and thousands and thousands of deaths"" by crippling UK infrastructure, the defence secretary has warned. Gavin Williamson told the Daily Telegraph,externalthat Moscow was spying on energy supplies which, if cut, could cause ""total chaos"" in the country. He said it was ""the real threat... the country is facing at the moment."" Head of the British army, Sir Nick Carter, has warned the UK is struggling to keep up with Russian capabilities. UK security chief blames Russia for hacks Russian politicians dismiss May criticism UK 'must prepare for Russia fight' The UK has four undersea connections for electricity linked to the continent and a further four for gas to bring energy into the country. Mr Williamson,who became defence secretary last November, said Russia had been researching these types of connections and would be willing to take action ""any other nation would see as completely unacceptable"". He told the paper: ""The plan for the Russians won't be for landing craft to appear in the South Bay in Scarborough, and off Brighton beach. ""They are going to be thinking, 'how can we just cause so much pain to Britain? ""Damage its economy, rip its infrastructure apart, actually cause thousands and thousands and thousands of deaths, but actually have an element of creating total chaos within the country."" Official representative of the Russian Defence, Ministry Major-General Igor Konashenkov, accused the defence secretary of losing ""his understanding of where the limits of common sense lie long ago"". He added that Mr Williamson's ""morbid fear"" of Russian activities belonged in a children's comic book or an episode of Monty Python's Flying Circus. Allow Twitter content?

The BBC's defence correspondent, Jonathan Beale, said some may see the defence secretary's language as ""alarmist"". But he was backed by former First Sea Lord and security minister Lord West, who told the paper he was ""absolutely certain"" Russia was looking at how to get into the UK's critical infrastructure. The warning comes after the chief of the National Cyber Security Centre, Ciaran Martin, said earlier this week thatRussia had already staged attacksagainst Britain's media, telecommunications and energy sectors over the past year. It comes as the Ministry of Defence is under pressure to avoid cuts that could be coming from the Treasury. Mr Williamson has already been told there could be a Tory revolt over reductions to army numbers and naval capability, and suggested he will be asking the chancellor for more money.

"The Scottish Daily Mail has published an apology to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon over its story about flying the Union flag. It had reported that Ms Sturgeon ""decreed"" that the flag should not be flown over dozens of public buildings to mark royal events. The Mail said it was ""happy"" to clarify that the decision was taken by former First Minister Alex Salmond in 2010. Ms Sturgeon said the original story was ""utterly false"". Fact check: Scotland's Union flag row In its clarifications and corrections section, the Mail said: ""We are happy to clarify that the decision to change the policy on flag flying was taken and implemented by former First Minister Alex Salmond in 2010. ""The Protocol and Honours Team updated operational guidance in December 2017. ""We accept that the policy did not change under Nicola Sturgeon and that she had no involvement in the Protocol and Honours Team updating the operational guidance on flag flying for 2018. ""We apologise to Ms Sturgeon for the contrary impression given."" The first minister has tweeted: ""The Daily Mail has admitted that its ridiculous story about me and flags was utterly false and issued a full apology."" The row follows astory published in three newspapers on Wednesdaythat the flag policy change would see ""dozens of public buildings"" cut the number of days they fly the Union flag from 15 to one - Remembrance Day. The Daily Telegraph also said Ms Sturgeon had ""hauled down the Union flag"", while the Daily Express claimed the move was ""a snub to the Queen"". Ms Sturgeon took the papers to task on Twitter - where she posted more than a dozen tweets calling the story ""simply untrue"" and ""ridiculous"" - while her predecessor Alex Salmond issued a statement attacking those spreading the tale as ""ignoramuses"". However, in a ruling issued in May, the newspaper standards body Ipso ruled theTelegraph,externalandExpress,externalreports had not breached its code on accuracy.

"(L-R) John Anglin, Clarence Anglin and Frank Morris before their escape A mysterious letter has come to light purportedly from one of three inmates who famously escaped Alcatraz in 1962. Someone claiming to be John Anglin wrote to San Francisco police in 2013, but it has only now been made public. ""My name is John Anglin,"" reads the letter. ""I escape from Alcatraz in June 1962. Yes we all made it that night, but barely!"" To this day, the three escapees remain on the most wanted list with photos of what they might look like today. It claims brothers John and Clarence Anglin along with inmate Frank Morris lived into old age after escaping the prison half a century ago. The author says Clarence Anglin died in 2008 and that Morris died in 2005. The writer tries to make a deal with authorities, saying: ""If you announce on TV that I will be promised to just go to jail for no more than a year and get medical attention I will write back to let you know exactly where I am. Letter allegedly sent from prisoner John Anglin ""I am 83 years old and in bad shape. I have cancer."" According to the letter, John Anglin lived in Seattle for most of his life and spent eight years in North Dakota. At the time the letter was sent he was reportedly living in southern California. San Francisco police did not make the letter public despite obtaining it five years ago,according to CBS,external. A prison cell in Alcatraz It was given toSan Francisco television station KPIX,externalfrom an unnamed source. The US Marshals Service, which has been responsible for the case since 1978, submitted the letter to the FBI laboratory for forensic handwriting analysis. ""Handwriting samples of all three escapees, John Anglin, Clarence Anglin and Frank Morris, were compared to the anonymous letter, and the results were deemed 'inconclusive,'"" said a statement from the US Marshals Service. Hidden history found beneath Alcatraz The nephew of John and Clarence Anglin told CBS that his grandmother used to receive roses with John and Clarence's signature on the cards several years after the escape. ""I really haven't come to a conclusion whether I believe that it's John reaching out or not,"" nephew David Widner said. Mr Widner expressed dismay that the letter was not delivered in a timely manner to the family. ""For him to say he had cancer and was dying, I feel like they should have at least reached out to the family and let them know it existed,"" he said. Behind bars for robbing a bank, the three prisoners proved that Alcatraz -a federal penitentiary reserved for the ""worst of the worst"" - was not as ""escape proof"" as once believed. It is believed the three inmates spent months digging a tunnel out of their cells using sharpened spoons. The men made an inflatable raft out of raincoats, set off into the water sometime at night, and were never seen again. A view of Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary in the 1930s when it was America's premier maximum-security prison The former prison is now a popular San Francisco tourist site, with more than a million tourists each year. John Anglin's cell, where he escaped through a vent in the wall, is one of the main attractions on the tour. The prison, built on a rocky outcrop in the middle of the bay, was shut down in 1963, a year after the men's escape. Authorities said at the time there was no way the trio could have swum across the frigid waters of the San Francisco bay, although the span is today tackled by triathletes. The breakout was immortalised in the 1979 movie Escape from Alcatraz, starring Clint Eastwood.

"Casey Affleck pictured with his 2017 Oscar for best actor Oscar-winning actor Casey Affleck has pulled out of this year's Academy Awards, his publicist has confirmed. By tradition, Affleck - who won best actor for Manchester By The Sea in 2017 - would have been expected to present the best actress award this year. The actor, brother of Hollywood star Ben Affleck, was sued by two female crew members for alleged sexual harassment in 2010. He denies the allegations, and the lawsuits were settled out of court. An Oscars spokeswoman confirmed that Affleck would not attend, saying: ""We appreciate the decision to keep the focus on the show and on the great work of this year."" Oscars 2018: The nominees in full Affleck's accusers, producer Amanda White and director of photography Magdalena Gorka, say they were harassed during the making of the mockumentary film I'm Still Here, which Affleck directed. Ms White claimed that Affleck had refused to pay her salary because she would not spend the night in a hotel room with him, and said she endured, ""a nearly daily barrage of sexual comments, innuendo and unwelcome advances by crew members, within the presence and with the active encouragement of Affleck"". Casey Affleck at the premiere for I'm Still Here in September 2010 Ms Gorka alleged that Affleck, who was married at the time, had crawled into bed with her as she slept. The actor's lawyers argued that the allegations were part of a scheme to extort money from Affleck. The claims against Affleck have drawn renewed attention in the months since sexual abuse allegations were levelled against US movie mogul Harvey Weinstein. The Weinstein allegations sparked the rise of the #MeToo hashtag, which inspired a global movement of women and men to share their stories of sexual abuse and harassment. More than 300 actresses, writers and directors responded by launching Time's Up- a project to help fight sexual harassment in the film industry and other workplaces. The initiative was announced via a full-page ad printed in the New York Times. Actresses including Meryl Streep and Natalie Portman brought gender and racial justice activists as their guests to the Golden Globes At the 75th Golden Globe Awards earlier this month, a galaxy of A-list actresses took to the red carpet in black to honour victims of sexual harassment. Many actors signalled their support by wearing a Time's Up pin on their lapels. The event sawpowerful speeches about the sexual abuse scandal, including one from Oprah Winfreywhich received worldwide attention. The stars who did (and didn't) wear black to the Globes Golden Globe winners in call for change Within a fortnight, though, more than one Golden Globes winner had been publicly accused of sexual misconduct. US comedian and actorAziz Ansari, who won the gong for best TV actor in a comedy or musical, was accused of sexual assaultby a woman he had been on a date with. He responded that he had believed the encounter to be completely consensual. Days earlier, James Franco, who took home the best actor in a comedy Globe, was accused of sexual misconduct or inappropriate behaviour by five women, including students from his acting school. Several women have accused James Franco of inappropriate sexual behaviour He told a US TV show: ""I have my own side of this story, but I believe in these people that have been underrepresented getting their stories out enough that I will hold back things that I could say just because I believe in it that much."" Franco was due to appear on the front cover of Vanity Fair's Hollywood issue, alongside the likes of Jessica Chastain, Oprah Winfrey and Tom Hanks but was digitally removed before it was published. He had been photographed by Annie Leibovitz and interviewed,according to The Hollywood Reporter,external, before they made their decision. A spokesperson told THR: ""We made a decision not to include James Franco on the Hollywood cover once we learned of the misconduct allegations against him."" No reshoot was needed because those chosen for the cover are photographed separately in small groups. He also chose not to attend the 2018 Critics' Choice Awards in the second week of January, while the controversy was at its peak. The 2018 Oscars will take place on 4 March in Los Angeles.

"The UK economy expanded by a better-than-expected 0.5% in the last three months of 2017, official figures say. Economists had expected a 0.4% expansion in the three months to December. However, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the broader picture was ""slower and more uneven"" growth. In 2017 as a whole, growth was 1.8% compared with 1.9% in 2016 - the slowest since 2012, the ONS said. The services sector, which accounts for the bulk of the economy, expanded by 0.6% in the fourth quarter - stronger than the 0.4% rise in the three months to September. ""The boost to the economy at the end of the year came from a range of services including recruitment agencies, letting agents and office management,"" said Darren Morgan, head of GDP at the ONS. Carney calls for 'deeper relationship' with Europe Mortgage approvals at five-year low Yet consumer-facing parts of the services sector, which include distribution, hotels, catering, transport and communications, posted much slower growth, he said. Manufacturing also grew strongly, but construction contracted by 1% - its third consecutive fall and worst quarterly performance since the third quarter of 2012. John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, said construction appeared to be the sector most affected by Brexit-related uncertainty, deterring commercial property investment and dampening the housing market, particularly in London. Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Macroeconomics said the ""undeniably strong"" quarterly figures increased the chance of the Monetary Policy Committee raising interest rates again as soon as this summer. However, Hargreaves Lansdown senior economist Ben Brettell described growth as anaemic and doubted there would be more than one rate rise this year, ""probably in the autumn"". Sterling jumped 0.8% to $1.4253 following the release of the GDP figures. Choose your comparator. You might, like Bank of England governor Mark Carney, point out that the economy is about 1% smaller than the Bank predicted it would be before the Brexit vote. But that was in the event of a ""stay"" vote. Pro-Brexit critics might point out the economy is doing a lot better than his own warnings about the risk of a ""technical recession"" if the UK voted to leave. Annual growth of 1.8% may be less than we would like, but so far there is little sign of the Brexit-induced disaster that some predicted.

"This video can not be played Firefighters tackle the blaze in Miryang At least 37 people have been killed and about 130 injured in a fire at a hospital in South Korea. The blaze is thought to have started in the emergency room at Sejong Hospital in the south-eastern city of Miryang. Nearly 200 patients were inside the building and an adjoining nursing home when the fire broke out in the morning. It is South Korea's deadliest fire in almost a decade and the death toll is expected to rise with several of the injured in critical condition. Firefighters said the victims appeared to have died from smoke inhalation. Three hospital medical staff - a doctor, nurse and nursing assistant - are among the victims. Authorities have given varying death tolls, with police earlier saying 41 had died. But the officials later corrected this, saying some victims were counted twice. The fire completely gutted the hospital's first floor, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reports. Miryang is about 270km (168 miles) south-east of the capital, Seoul. The hospital specialised in caring for elderly people with long-term needs, as well as other patients, reported the daily JoongAng Ilbo - and reports suggest many patients would have been too ill or old to escape alone. The fire completely gutted the hospital's ground floor Many of those inside the burning building were elderly The paper quoted a surviving patient, Jang Yeong-jae, as saying that he was on the second floor when nurses screamed ""Fire!"" in the hallway and urged people to evacuate. ""But when I opened the exit door, the whole stairway was filled with dark smoke and I couldn't see a thing,"" he said. ""Everybody was running around in panic, falling over and screaming as smoke filled the rooms."" Mr Jang said he ripped open window screens and escaped down a ladder put up by firefighters. ""There were so many elderly patients on other floors... I wonder if they escaped safely,"" Mr Jang's wife was quoted as saying. Fire chief Choi Man-woo told reporters the cause of the fire was not yet known. The hospital building did not have any fire sprinklers installed, local media said. Under current laws, the building was not required to have sprinklers, but they were in the process of being fitted in the adjoining nursing home. A new law that is due to come into force on 30 June will make sprinklers compulsory for nursing homes. Most of the casualties were due to smoke inhalation Mr Choi said the fire started around 07:30 local time (22:30 GMT on Thursday) and was put out in about three hours. Ninety-four patients from the adjacent nursing home were safely evacuated. South Korean President Moon Jae-in arranged an emergency meeting to discuss ways of dealing with the fire. Senior officials from both governing and opposition parties travelled to Miryang to offer their condolences and call for a thorough investigation. It is not known what caused the fire Scores of patients were inside the building and a neighbouring nursing home The hospital has been operating since 2008 and about 35 medical staff work there, according to provincial officials. The fire comes just a month after29 people in the South Korean city of Jecheon were killedin a blaze at a public gym. The owner and manager of the building were later arrested over multiple safety lapses, including malfunctioning sprinkler systems.

"Doctors should not prescribe ""precious"" antibiotics for most people with sore throats and should recommend drugs like paracetamol, new guidelines say. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence said most sore throats were caused by viral infections, which cannot be treated by antibiotics. Butresearch suggests antibiotics are prescribed in 60% of sore throat cases.,external NICE said it was ""vital"" the medicines were only used when effective because of the rise of antibiotic resistance. The overuse of antibiotics is making infections harder to treat by creating drug-resistant superbugs. Patients 'need rest, not antibiotics' Why is it so difficult to discover new antibiotics? Acute sore throat, including pharyngitis and tonsillitis, can be caused by a bacterial or viral infection, with symptoms usually improving by themselves within a week. New guidelines from NICE and Public Health England, which aim to limit the use of antibiotics, said doctors should only be prescribing the medicines for more severe cases that are likely to have been caused by a bacterial infection. Most people should instead use pain relief drugs, which also include aspirin and ibuprofen, and certain throat lozenges, as well as drinking plenty of water and resting. Prof Cliodna McNulty, head of PHE's primary care unit, said: ""Antibiotics are a precious resource and it's important that they are only used when they are really needed. ""For a sore throat, evidence shows that antibiotics make little difference to length or severity of illness, unless symptoms are much more severe. While a sore throat can be painful, there are other ways to control the symptoms including taking paracetamol and medicated lozenges."" NICE and PHE also said doctors should use set criteria to judge how likely it is that people have sore throats caused by bacterial infections. This works by checking people for scores across a range of symptoms, which include fever, pus on tonsils, severely inflamed tonsils and the absence of a cough. England's chief medical officer, Dame Prof Sally Davies, has previously warned of a ""post-antibiotic apocalypse"" where infections would become harder to treat and common medical procedures such as cancer treatments could become too risky. In some casespeople have died from bugs that are resistantto all antibiotics. In October, PHE said patients had ""a part to play"" in stopping the rise of infections and that more of them should be told to go home and rest rather than be given antibiotics. In some cases people have died from bugs that are resistant to all antibiotics Prof Gillian Leng, deputy chief executive at NICE, said people who needed antibiotics should be given them. ""But it is clear that routine prescribing in all cases isn't appropriate,"" she said. ""We are living in a world where bacteria are becoming resistant to antibiotics. It is vital these medicines are protected, and only used when they are effective."" The Royal College of General Practitioners, which supports the new guidelines, said patients needed to understand that antibiotics are ""not a cure for every ill"".

"Everything looked fine as the rocket climbed away from the Kourou spaceport in French Guiana Europe's normally highly dependable rocket, the Ariane 5, experienced an anomaly during its latest launch. Telemetry from the vehicle was lost about nine minutes into its flight from French Guiana, shortly after its upper-stage began the final push for orbit. Uncertainty then followed as controllers tried to determine the status of the Ariane and the satellites it was carrying. Eventually, though, radio signals from the spacecraft were picked up. It seems the rocket did do its job - but beyond the sight of controllers on the ground. The explanation for the anomaly has been put down to the rocket deviating from its planned flight trajectory. However, it is also clear this left the satellites in a less than perfect orbit. Arianespace, the company that operates the rocket from the Kourou spaceport, said communications with the launcher were dropped just after second-stage ignition. ""Lift-off occurred as planned at 19:20 local time in Kourou,"" a statement read. ""At [lift-off] plus nine minutes, 26 seconds, ground tracking stations lost contact with the Ariane 5 launcher. ""Initial investigations show that the situation results from a trajectory deviation. At the end of the mission, the launcher separated both satellites on a stable orbit."" The circumstances will be investigated by an independent enquiry commission in conjunction with the European Space Agency. Arianespace CEO StÃ©phane IsraÃ«l and his team lost contact nine minutes into the flight One of the satellites that was onboard is owned by Luxembourg-based operator SES; the other belongs to UAE, Abu Dhabi-based Yahsat. They are both telecommunications platforms. The SES satellite, called SES-14, was manufactured by Airbus in the UK, at its Portsmouth and Stevenage plants, and at its Toulouse facility in France. SES has confirmed the platform is in good health but reveals also that it did not separate from the Ariane in the right place. Spacecraft are normally dropped off into a large ellipse around the planet which they must then first circularise and raise slightly before starting service. A platform will use its own thrusters to do this. SES said that, as a consequence of Thursday's anomaly, SES-14 would need an additional four weeks to reach the allocated orbital slot at 47.5 degrees West, 36,000km above the coast of northern South America. SES-14 has an electric propulsion system that raises its orbit slowly but with great fuel efficiency. It was originally due to be on-station in July. The delay means August is now the expected arrival time. The operator said the 15-year lifetime of SES-14 had not been compromised. Likewise, Yahsat said its platform, Al Yah-3, had been ""inserted into an orbit that differed from the flight plan"". Al Yah-3, built by Orbital ATK in the US, carries a conventional chemical propulsion system. And although this does not have the fuel efficiency of electric thrusters, Yahsat seems confident the spacecraft will eventually reach the desired position in the sky. ""We are pleased to know that the satellite is healthy, and that the necessary steps are being taken to ensure the original mission is fulfilled,"" Masood M Sharif Mahmood, CEO at Yahsat, said in a statement. The Ariane 5 has had an unblemished record since 2003 What happened during Thursday's flight was highly unusual. After a difficult introduction in the late 1990s, the Ariane 5 has since set a benchmark for reliability in the launcher business. Before this mission, it had gone to space 82 times on the trot without mishap. The inquiry will try to determine what exactly went wrong and will assess whether any changes are required to the vehicle's design or operation to ensure there is no repeat telemetry loss in future. In the meantime, preparations for further launches from Kourou will ""proceed as scheduled"", Arianespace said. On the current calendar, the rocket is due to make up to six more flights this year.

"The number of drivers breaking down after hitting potholes has seen a ""concerning"" rise, according to the RAC. The RAC saw an 11% jump in breakdowns caused by poor quality roads in the last three months of 2017. The firm blamed snow and icy conditions, and warned many roads are ""hanging in the balance"" if conditions are particularly cold or wet in spring. Drivers can face a bill of hundreds of pounds if their cars hit a pothole. The Department for Transport said it was investing Â£23bn to increase capacity and improve road journeys. The RAC was called to 2,830 pothole-related breakdowns between October and December, compared with 2,547 in the period a year before. RAC chief engineer David Bizley said the figures would be ""met with concern"" among drivers because potholes represent a ""serious road safety risk"". Driving into potholes can cause broken suspension springs, damaged shock absorbers and distorted wheels. After several years of improvements to road quality, the latest analysis suggests it has gone backwards for the third successive quarter, he said. Call for road pricing tailored to drivers Most potholes develop on local roads which councils are responsible for, rather than motorways and trunk roads. Local councils warned on Thursday they would need to spend Â£12bn to address the current backlog of road repair work, including fixing potholes. The Local Government Association called for extra government funding, saying that motorways and major trunk roads receive 52 times more funding than local roads. Three councils are now trialling the use of cameras mounted on bin lorries, buses and electric bikes to capture images of potholes and detect weak spots. Eddie is the first driver in Britain to have a pothole camera installed on his bin lorry. He is part of a trial, funded by the Department for Transport, that gathers real-time data on the quality of the road network in Thurrock, Essex. All Eddie has to do is keep the camera clean and go about his usual route, covering up to 60 miles a day, 5 days a week. The images are then relayed back to engineers to examine not only where existing potholes are, but where they are likely to develop in future. Most councils use an on-board camera system on bin lorries for health and safety purposes. It is hoped that in the future these fleets could become the frontline in the war against potholes.

"This video can not be played Trump: We're on the same wavelength President Donald Trump has predicted a ""tremendous increase"" in UK-US trade, after talks with Theresa May. He also said the US and UK were ""joined at the hip"" on military matters, while Mrs May said they stood ""shoulder to shoulder"" in facing shared threats. In a series of warm exchanges in Davos, Switzerland, President Trump also told the UK PM:  ""We love your country."" He also rejected ""false rumours"" of differences, saying that the two leaders ""like each other a lot"". And Downing Street said later that they had asked officials to work on ""finalising the details of a visit by the president to the UK later this year"". It was their first meeting since clashing over the US president's retweets of far-right videos in November. And earlier this month Mr Trump cancelled a visit to the UK, criticising the location of the new US embassy in London. But after their meeting, Mr Trump told Mrs May at their news conference: ""I have great respect for everything you are doing, we love your country, I think it's really great."" Pay attention to UK-US rapport, says Tillerson US revives post-Brexit trade deal hopes May calls for online terror crackdown Trump casts doubt on Middle East peace talks The two leaders met in Davos, at the World Economic Forum, with post-Brexit trade relations between the two countries high on the agenda. Mr Trump said: ""One thing that will be taking place over a number of years will be trade. Trade is going to increase many times. ""I look forward to that... the discussions... that will be taking place are going to lead to tremendous increases in trade between our two countries which is great for both in terms of jobs. We look forward to that and we are starting that process, pretty much as we speak."" He added the US would be ""there to fight for you - you know that"" and the two were ""joined at the hip when it comes to the military"". Mrs May replied that the ""really special relationship"" between the UK and US continued and they stood ""shoulder to shoulder because we are facing the same challenges across the world"". ""Alongside that working for a good trade relationship for the future which will be for both our benefits, so the UK and the US both do well out of this - and it's been great to see you today."" In response to reporters' questions, both leaders said they would ""talk about"" his state visit to the UK - offered by Mrs May when she visited him in Washington shortly after he became US president. No date has been set. Downing Street later confirmed that the visit officials were discussing this year would be a working, not a state, visit. But BBC North America editor Jon Sopel said the British would be pleased with the press call. The mood music had been good and the Americans were talking positively about a trade deal. The UK prime minister also spoke about the need to put more pressure on tech giants to deal with extremist content A Downing Street spokesman said the two leaders had also discussed the Bombardier trade dispute and that Mrs May had ""reiterated"" the importance of the firm to Northern Ireland, Iran, Syria and Brexit negotiations. The UK prime minister had earlier addressed the World Economic Forum about the need to put more pressure on tech giants to deal with extremist content and tackle child abuse and modern slavery on social networks. She said shareholders should use their influence to ""ensure these issues are taken seriously"". ""No-one wants to be known as the terrorist platform, or the first-choice app for paedophiles,"" she said. She said some progress had been made but more must be done ""so that ultimately this content is removed automatically"". She acknowledged people's concerns about the impact of technology on jobs - pointing to Uber as an example of a company that had ""got things wrong along the way"". The ride-hailing firm should not be shut down but should address concerns about safety and workers' rights and enforce standards ""that can make this technology work for customers and employees alike"", she said. Mrs May said that employment law must keep pace with the way technology is changing jobs and while it must protect the ""flexibility"" companies valued, it must not be ""a one way street deal that can become exploitative."" The UK is in the process of leaving the European Union - the day set for Brexit is 29 March, 2019, so is expected to negotiate its own trade deals in future, rather than being part of the deals drawn up on behalf of  all EU member states.

"It's the first time in almost 20 years a sitting US president has come to Davos Donald Trump's visit to the World Economic Forum in Davos was billed as a showdown between the sophisticated ""global elites"" who attend in droves, and the baseball-cap wearing president's brash ""America First"" rhetoric. Yet mention his name in the bustling foyer of the Congress Centre, and the reaction is surprisingly benign. Many attendees shrug indifferently, rather than launch into an angry rant. Gabrielle Bacon says she is more interested in Europe's politicians' statements Gabrielle Bacon, who lives in the US, says she gets to listen to President Trump a lot at home, and is not remotely excited about his Davos appearance. Her main interest is in the European leaders who have spoken here, such as French President Emmanuel Macron and Italy's Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni. More from the BBC's Davos coverage She predicts, however, that his speech may not go down well, saying that President Trump is sometimes misunderstood in Europe. ""He doesn't talk in the same way as the European leaders and I think that's very confusing to people,"" she explains. Keen to clarify that she's not defending Donald Trump, Mrs Bacon says that his much-touted ""America First"" message is seen by some in the US as wanting the best for citizens there, but it doesn't mean that he doesn't want good things for other countries too. Nonetheless, she's glad he's come: ""Every leader should have their shot up there"". Hindou Oumarou Ibrahim says she won't '""waste my time"" thinking about President Trump Hindou Oumarou Ibrahim, co-ordinator for the Association for Indigenous Women and Peoples of Chad, thinks the president's visit is drawing attention away from more respected attendees. ""Personally, I'm not a fan, I am not going to be here to listen to what he is going to say,"" she says. ""What Justin [Trudeau] and Macron and the president of WEF said, those are the words of politicians who resonated in my head, and who are are calling on people to collaborate, to come together, to respect women's rights, to change the economy, to respect the environment - what is [Trump] going to say that is better than what they said?"" Ms Ibrahim, who first came to Davos a year ago, says Donald Trump's profanity-laden comments about immigrants from countries like hers have not been forgotten. ""I am still shocked by what he said last week about African and Caribbean countries,"" she says. ""I don't want to waste my time or energy thinking about [Trump]"" Some delegates are reluctant to put their views of Trump's visit on record, and privately have reservations about whether his arrival, along with the biggest ever US government delegation in WEF's 48-year history, will achieve much beyond generating headlines. ""I think it's very good that he's coming, because he has to be exposed to what is going on in the world,"" says one Israeli financier. Not that the exposure will mean much, he adds. ""He's driven by something else,"" the man, on his fourth trip to WEF, says. ""He's coming to calm down the world, but then somebody will [annoy] him the day after tomorrow, and he will tweet it all around the world, and that's it."" Donald Trump has extended a hand to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whom he met at Davos, by promising to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, recognising the latter as Israel's capital. But the Israeli delegate we spoke to thinks this move is counter-productive, especially for those representing his country on the ""Magic Mountain"". ""It will not help in our relations with the Palestinians, and we are coming here to build it up, we want to talk, we want to get a solution."" Layla Dong says Davos is open to everyone, whether Donald Trump or Kim Jong-un Chinese delegate Layla Dong, is adamant that inviting Donald Trump to Davos was the right thing to do. ""It's an open platform, we will welcome him because he's the president of the United States,"" she explains. ""The Forum is all about being a platform for people to communicate, so we are open to everybody, and if one day, the leader of North Korea wants to come to the Forum, they should also be welcomed"". Yet Ms Dong, who has been coming to Davos for three years, is sceptical about whether Mr Trump will say much worthy of note. On her phone, she points to a response to Trump's tweet on Thursday, announcing that he was heading to Davos to ""tell the world how great America is and is doing."" The riposte reads: ""It's only a few days after your first government shutdown, and you're going to Switzerland to lecture other countries on how they run their governments. You're funny."" ""I agree with this guy,"" she says. Andrea Bandelli hopes Mr Trump's visit will be ""constructive rather than destructive"" Andrea Bandelli is chief executive of Science Gallery International, a group which works to engage young people with science. He isn't planning to listen to President Trump due to other meetings that clash with the speech. But he's still glad that Mr Trump decided to come, saying the whole point of the World Economic Forum is that everybody should be invited. For all attendees here, he says, how much they get out of it depends on how well they listen and how much empathy they have. His hope is that President Trump's visit will be ""a constructive one rather than a destructive one"". Mr Bandelli notes that the point of the Forum is to bring everyone together, and that ""no one comes here with a reason that is higher than anybody else's"". ""We're all equal here and that's how we are treated,"" he says. But might President Trump, who is not known for his humility, find that rather difficult? ""There is always a chance that everybody is changed for the better after attending the annual meeting,"" he quips.

"This video can not be played Where does Northern Ireland's electricity come from? Kilroot power station in County Antrim is facing closure within months with the loss of up to 240 jobs. A further 30 jobs are under threat at Ballylumford power station. Kilroot failed to win a major generation contract in an auction process to supply the all-island Single Electricity Market (SEM). Kilroot power station, near Carrickfergus, failed to win a major contract Reforms to the SEM take effect later this year with a series of new one-year contracts intended to increase competition and lower prices. It is understood that maintenance costs were a significant factor in the Kilroot bid. East Antrim MP Sammy Wilson said the effect of the job losses at Kilroot and Ballylumford ""cannot be underestimated"". This video can not be played 'Without Kilroot we would not have been able to keep the lights on in NI' - Sammy Wilson Kilroot, near Carrickfergus, is one of Northern Ireland's main power plants and uses relatively old and inefficient coal-fired generation. It was always likely to face closure in 2024 as the coal-burning technology would not meet environmental standards. Kilroot's owner, AES, said that without a new contract the power station cannot cover its costs so is now expected to close when the new market begins operating at the end of May. Richard Morgan, BBC News NI reporter It's understood management is due to meet staff to discuss what happens next. We've been told by one representative that it's thought a 90-day notice for redundancies could be issued as early as today. It's going to be an anxious wait for staff - they're facing the prospect of closure in May this year, which is much sooner than they had anticipated. Kilroot power station on Friday morning, after news broke that it would be closing AES UK & Ireland president Ian Luney said that over the last three years Kilroot met 22% of local electricity demand and he was ""surprised"" at the decision not to award the contract. A contract relating to part of the Ballylumford power station, near Islandmagee, has also not been renewed, threatening 30 jobs there. Of the other jobs, 120 are staff at Kilroot and the other 120 relate to contractors. The chief executive of the Utility Regulator, Jenny Pyper, said it was important to note that the SEM auction only allocates capacity for the next year. ""There will continue to be commercial opportunities for new and existing generators to participate in the market in further auctions later this year,"" she said. She said the decision to close the Kilroot plant has now triggered the Plant Closure Process which is designed to ensure security of supply and the needs of the system continue to be met. Robin McCormick, general manager of SONI - the System Operator for Northern Ireland - said: ""We are confident that the generators who have been successful in that auction process will provide sufficient and secure generation for NI at the lowest possible cost."" Kilroot was likely to close by 2024 because its coal-fired technology would not meet environmental standards Mr Luney, of Kilroot's owner AES  said he was concerned that the closure could lead to supply problems. ""With the likely absence of any significant and reliable new generation in the next four years and a North-South interconnector that isn't expected to come online until 2021, we are concerned that the removal of capacity at Kilroot and Ballylumford could contribute to a significant risk to the security and stability of supply in Northern Ireland,"" he said. Kilroot is one of Northern Ireland's main power stations Mr Wilson, a DUP MP, also raised concerns over the ""continuity of electricity supply and the price of electricity"". He said that an explanation must be given as to how ""energy delivered by Kilroot in the past three years is now going to be delivered efficiently and without disruption"". ""I don't believe that the assurances sought will be given and, if that is the case, then immediate steps must be taken to arrange a contract with AES which will keep electricity flowing into the system,"" he said. Alliance Party MLA Stewart Dickson said the decision not to award Kilroot a contract seemed ""premature and potentially counter-productive"". He said he was ""deeply concerned"" about the impact job losses will have on the local area as well as the security of Northern Ireland's electricity supply. TUV leader Jim Allister said the closure was the consequence of the ""dash"" to establish an all-island single energy market. Kilroot uses coal to generate power ""As we lose generating capacity and control, Northern Ireland may well be at the painful end of the ROI-orientated change, which is being rushed in with no proper transition period or protections on security or supply."" Joanne McWilliams, regional officer for trade union Unite, said the closure ""effectively shuts down 36% of Northern Ireland's electrical generation capacity"" and was a ""disaster for local jobs and security of supply"". The new market has been designed by the utility regulators on both sides of the border and the auction process was run by the Eirgrid group, which operates the electricity gird. It is understood that Eirgrid assesses that supply issues will not arise before 2021 and thereafter will be dealt with by the new Interconnector. Rodney Doyle, Director of Market Operations at EirGrid Group, said the auction had been ""a major milestone"" as the industry transitions to the new market arrangements. ""The auction successfully ran in accordance with the approved capacity market code,"" he said. ""There were 100 bidders in the auction, of which 93 were successful.""

"The Scottish Daily Mail has published an apology to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon over its story about flying the Union flag. It had reported that Ms Sturgeon ""decreed"" that the flag should not be flown over dozens of public buildings to mark royal events. The Mail said it was ""happy"" to clarify that the decision was taken by former First Minister Alex Salmond in 2010. Ms Sturgeon said the original story was ""utterly false"". Fact check: Scotland's Union flag row In its clarifications and corrections section, the Mail said: ""We are happy to clarify that the decision to change the policy on flag flying was taken and implemented by former First Minister Alex Salmond in 2010. ""The Protocol and Honours Team updated operational guidance in December 2017. ""We accept that the policy did not change under Nicola Sturgeon and that she had no involvement in the Protocol and Honours Team updating the operational guidance on flag flying for 2018. ""We apologise to Ms Sturgeon for the contrary impression given."" The first minister has tweeted: ""The Daily Mail has admitted that its ridiculous story about me and flags was utterly false and issued a full apology."" The row follows astory published in three newspapers on Wednesdaythat the flag policy change would see ""dozens of public buildings"" cut the number of days they fly the Union flag from 15 to one - Remembrance Day. The Daily Telegraph also said Ms Sturgeon had ""hauled down the Union flag"", while the Daily Express claimed the move was ""a snub to the Queen"".

"It's the first time in almost 20 years a sitting US president has come to Davos Donald Trump's visit to the World Economic Forum in Davos was billed as a showdown between the sophisticated ""global elites"" who attend in droves, and the baseball-cap wearing president's brash ""America First"" rhetoric. Yet mention his name in the bustling foyer of the Congress Centre, and the reaction is surprisingly benign. Many attendees shrug indifferently, rather than launch into an angry rant. Gabrielle Bacon says she is more interested in Europe's politicians' statements Gabrielle Bacon, who lives in the US, says she gets to listen to President Trump a lot at home, and is not remotely excited about his Davos appearance. Her main interest is in the European leaders who have spoken here, such as French President Emmanuel Macron and Italy's Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni. More from the BBC's Davos coverage She predicts, however, that his speech may not go down well, saying that President Trump is sometimes misunderstood in Europe. ""He doesn't talk in the same way as the European leaders and I think that's very confusing to people,"" she explains. Keen to clarify that she's not defending Donald Trump, Mrs Bacon says that his much-touted ""America First"" message is seen by some in the US as wanting the best for citizens there, but it doesn't mean that he doesn't want good things for other countries too. Nonetheless, she's glad he's come: ""Every leader should have their shot up there"". Hindou Oumarou Ibrahim says she won't '""waste my time"" thinking about President Trump Hindou Oumarou Ibrahim, co-ordinator for the Association for Indigenous Women and Peoples of Chad, thinks the president's visit is drawing attention away from more respected attendees. ""Personally, I'm not a fan, I am not going to be here to listen to what he is going to say,"" she says. ""What Justin [Trudeau] and Macron and the president of WEF said, those are the words of politicians who resonated in my head, and who are are calling on people to collaborate, to come together, to respect women's rights, to change the economy, to respect the environment - what is [Trump] going to say that is better than what they said?"" Ms Ibrahim, who first came to Davos a year ago, says Donald Trump's profanity-laden comments about immigrants from countries like hers have not been forgotten. ""I am still shocked by what he said last week about African and Caribbean countries,"" she says. ""I don't want to waste my time or energy thinking about [Trump]"" Some delegates are reluctant to put their views of Trump's visit on record, and privately have reservations about whether his arrival, along with the biggest ever US government delegation in WEF's 48-year history, will achieve much beyond generating headlines. ""I think it's very good that he's coming, because he has to be exposed to what is going on in the world,"" says one Israeli financier. Not that the exposure will mean much, he adds. ""He's driven by something else,"" the man, on his fourth trip to WEF, says. ""He's coming to calm down the world, but then somebody will [annoy] him the day after tomorrow, and he will tweet it all around the world, and that's it."" Donald Trump has extended a hand to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whom he met at Davos, by promising to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, recognising the latter as Israel's capital. But the Israeli delegate we spoke to thinks this move is counter-productive, especially for those representing his country on the ""Magic Mountain"". ""It will not help in our relations with the Palestinians, and we are coming here to build it up, we want to talk, we want to get a solution."" Layla Dong says Davos is open to everyone, whether Donald Trump or Kim Jong-un Chinese delegate Layla Dong, is adamant that inviting Donald Trump to Davos was the right thing to do. ""It's an open platform, we will welcome him because he's the president of the United States,"" she explains. ""The Forum is all about being a platform for people to communicate, so we are open to everybody, and if one day, the leader of North Korea wants to come to the Forum, they should also be welcomed"". Yet Ms Dong, who has been coming to Davos for three years, is sceptical about whether Mr Trump will say much worthy of note. On her phone, she points to a response to Trump's tweet on Thursday, announcing that he was heading to Davos to ""tell the world how great America is and is doing."" The riposte reads: ""It's only a few days after your first government shutdown, and you're going to Switzerland to lecture other countries on how they run their governments. You're funny."" ""I agree with this guy,"" she says. Andrea Bandelli hopes Mr Trump's visit will be ""constructive rather than destructive"" Andrea Bandelli is chief executive of Science Gallery International, a group which works to engage young people with science. He isn't planning to listen to President Trump due to other meetings that clash with the speech. But he's still glad that Mr Trump decided to come, saying the whole point of the World Economic Forum is that everybody should be invited. For all attendees here, he says, how much they get out of it depends on how well they listen and how much empathy they have. His hope is that President Trump's visit will be ""a constructive one rather than a destructive one"". Mr Bandelli notes that the point of the Forum is to bring everyone together, and that ""no one comes here with a reason that is higher than anybody else's"". ""We're all equal here and that's how we are treated,"" he says. But might President Trump, who is not known for his humility, find that rather difficult? ""There is always a chance that everybody is changed for the better after attending the annual meeting,"" he quips.

"This video can not be played Undocumented immigrants: ""Life in the US is like a rollercoaster"" The White House has outlined an immigration plan for nearly two million people to become US citizens in exchange for funding for a controversial border wall with Mexico. The framework was suggested by a senior Trump aide, ahead of legislative negotiations with Democrats. The proposed bill, to be unveiled on Monday, requests $25bn (Â£17.6bn) in funds for a wall on the Mexican border. The Democrats, who oppose funding for the wall, have criticised the plan. The details emerged in a conference call on Thursday between White House policy chief Stephen Miller and Republican congressional aides, according to US media. Mr Miller reportedly described the White House plan as a ""dramatic concession"". The blueprint sets out a 10-12-year path to citizenship for 1.8 million people. This video can not be played Can US border agents lawfully search you? This includes some 700,000 so-called Dreamers, immigrants who illegally entered the US as children and were protected from deportation under an Obama-era programme, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca). The other 1.1 million would be immigrants who did not apply for Daca but are eligible for the scheme. The White House framework also seeks to end two other initiatives often criticised by President Donald Trump. It proposes to curtail so-called chain migration, permitting US residents only to get visas for their spouse and children, not for extended family members. The White House also wants to scrap the diversity visa lottery, under which 50,000 people from around the world every year win Green Cards at random. What is the diversity green card lottery? This video can not be played Am I American yet? Republican US Senator Tom Cotton, one of the most conservative voices on immigration policy, welcomed Mr Trump's plan. ""The president's framework is generous and humane, while also being responsible,"" the Arkansas senator said in a statement. Democrats were less impressed. ""Dreamers should not be held hostage to President Trump's crusade to tear families apart and waste billions of American tax dollars on an ineffective wall,"" Senate Democratic whip Dick Durbin said in a statement. New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez was among those tweeting their frustration. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

United We Dream, a young immigrants' organisation, called the White House plan ""a white supremacist ransom note"". Mr Trump cancelled the programme in September and gave Congress a March deadline to come up with a new plan. The president has so far rejected bipartisan proposals that have been presented to him. Congress' failure to secure a deal on immigration triggered a brief shutdown of the federal government over the weekend. This video can not be played The missing - consequences of Trump's immigration crackdown On Wednesday, Mr Trump said he was optimistic that a deal on immigration would be reached that included keeping the so-called Dreamers in the country. He added that it was an ""incentive"" for so-called Dreamers to work hard and ""do a great job"". The Republican president has made it clear that in exchange for making a concession to help accomplish a Democratic priority, he wants the party's backing for his signature campaign promise to deliver a border wall. However, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer this week withdrew an offer of funding for Mr Trump's proposed border barrier. The other 'Dreamers' facing uncertain future Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington There's a quote from Mark Twain that if you don't like the weather in New England, just wait five minutes. The same could be said of Donald Trump's position on immigration. One day he'll accept - and take the heat for - any bipartisan deal Congress might strike. Later, he insists any agreement must include funding for his border wall and sweeping changes to legal immigration. During the shutdown, he painted Democratic efforts to get a Daca vote as support for ""unchecked illegal immigration"". On Wednesday, he expressed an openness to giving Daca recipients a path to citizenship - something many of his supporters deride as amnesty for lawbreakers. This could be part of some grand ""art of the deal"" presidential strategy, which will only be revealed in hindsight. Or perhaps congressional parties should focus on people like chief of staff John Kelly, who stayed in Washington to negotiate while the president hob-nobs with the global elite in Davos.

"Left-right: Nicky Campbell, Huw Edwards, Jon Sopel, Jeremy Vine, Nick Robinson and John Humphrys Six of the BBC's leading male presenters have agreed to take pay cuts after revelations over equal salaries. The BBC said Huw Edwards, Nicky Campbell, John Humphrys, Jon Sopel, Nick Robinson and Jeremy Vine had all accepted reduced wages. The move follows Carrie Gracie'sresignation as BBC China editorin protest at unequal pay between male and female international editors. Humphrys said he would be earning ""hugely less"" than the Â£600,000 he was. The move comes after the BBCrevealed the pay of on-air talent earning over Â£150,000in July. Two-thirds of stars on the list, including the top seven earners, were men. This video can not be played John Humphrys says pay cut is 'fair' Humphrys, the presenter on Radio 4's flagship Today programme and Mastermind, was revealed to have earned between Â£600,000 and Â£649,999 in 2016/17. He refused to confirm or deny reports that his pay packet had been halved, to Â£250,000-Â£300,000, but did say his new salary would be ""a lot less than Â£600,000"". He said he had, in fact, taken a total of three pay cuts. ""It seemed fair,"" he told BBC News. ""The BBC used to have, in the good old days, an awful lot of money. ""It no longer has an awful lot of money. I was earning a lot of money and it seemed entirely proper to me that I should take a few pay cuts."" Of the six men, Radio 2 and Eggheads presenter Jeremy Vine was the best-paid of the group, earning between Â£700,000-Â£749,999 in 2016/17. Jon Sopel, the BBC's North America editor, earned the least, in the Â£200,000-Â£249,999 bracket - compared to Carrie Gracie's Â£135,000-a-year salary. The BBC did not comment how much the presenters would now receive. A BBC statement said: ""We are very grateful to Huw Edwards, Nicky Campbell, John Humphrys, Jon Sopel, Nick Robinson and Jeremy Vine, who have agreed that their pay will now be reduced. ""These are great journalists and presenters, who have a real connection with the audience. We are proud to have them working at the BBC. ""The final details of some of these changes are still being discussed, and there are further conversations that the BBC will have with others in due course."" Carrie Gracie published an open letter giving her reasons for resigning as China editor On his way into work at Radio 2 on Friday, Vine was asked by reporters why he had agreed to a lower wage. ""I think it needs to be sorted out and I support my female colleagues who have rightly said they should be paid the same when they're doing the same job,"" he said. ""It's just a no-brainer, so it wasn't a problem for me to accept one [a pay cut]."" An independent audit into equal pay at the BBC will be published next week. When the list of the best-paid BBC presenters that was published last summer, Chris Evans was at the top, earning between Â£2.2m and Â£2.25m in 2016/2017. The highest-paid woman, Claudia Winkleman, earned significantly less - between Â£450,000 and Â£500,000. BBC media editor Amol Rajan said while competition in the entertainment industry had intensified, the opposite had happened in news. ""Many of those now taking pay cuts secured generous deals years ago,"" he said. ""That world has disappeared - and these presenters now accept that a chunk of their salaries will have to disappear with it."" This video can not be played Jeremy Vine: Taking a pay cut is 'a no-brainer' After leaving her post as China editor, Gracie is now returning to the BBC newsroom in London, saying she expects to be ""paid equally"". She is due to appear before a select committee of MPs on Wednesday next week, shortly before director general of the BBC Tony Hall, his deputy Anne Bulford and director of news and current affairs Fran Unsworth. They were called to discuss what action the corporation is taking to address the gender pay gap. Damian Collins MP, chair of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee, said: ""While it is admirable that these BBC presenters want to show solidarity for their female colleagues by taking a pay cut, it doesn't address the fundamental issues of pay inequality that Carrie Gracie and others have raised."" He added that they would hear from Gracie and senior BBC figures at the committee session. There have been three investigations into gender pay at the BBC: A report was published in October, in line with a requirement on all large organisations. Itfound the gender pay gap at the BBC was 9.3%,external, against a national average of 18.1% A judge-led audit of equal pay among rank-and-file staff published at the same time found there was ""no question of any systemic gender discrimination"" A review into the BBC's approach to the pay of on-air presenters, editors and correspondents is due to be published next week Lord Hall pledged to close the gap by 2020, saying the corporation should be ""an exemplar of what can be achieved when it comes to pay, fairness, gender and representation"".

"This video can not be played Trump: I would certainly apologise if you would like me to do that US President Donald Trump has said he is prepared to apologise for retweeting posts from a British far-right group. In an interview with ITV's Piers Morgan, Mr Trump said he knew ""nothing"" about Britain First beforesharing three of its videos in November. ""If you are telling me they're horrible people, horrible, racist people, I would certainly apologise if you'd like me to do that,"" he told Morgan. The interview, held in Davos, will be broadcast on 28 January at 22:00 GMT. The president's sharing of the controversial videos to his 40 million followers sparked aTwitter row with the UK prime minister, who criticised the move. ""I'm very clear that retweeting from Britain First was the wrong thing to do,"" Mrs May said, prompting Mr Trump to instruct the PM to focus on ""terrorism"" in the UK instead. Asked if he regretted the tweets, Mr Trump said, ""it was done because I am a big believer in fighting radical Islamic terror"". But he insisted he knew ""nothing about"" Britain First before sharing posts by the group's deputy leader Jayda Fransen - who isfacing a trial in April, accused of using threatening, abusive or insulting words at a protest in Belfast last year. ""I know nothing about them, I don't want to be involved with people [like that],"" Mr Trump told Morgan. Who has Trump criticised on Twitter? Davos shrugs off President Trump's visit Trump and his social media 'filter bubble' One of the videos retweeted by Mr Trump shows unverified footage of a ""Muslim migrant"" attacking a young Dutch man on crutches, with another showing a man smashing a statue of the Virgin Mary. The third video, originating from riots that took place in Egypt in 2013, shows a man being pushed from the top of a building. Mr Trump told Morgan: ""Here's what's fair - if you're telling me they're horrible people, horrible racist people, I would certainly apologise if you'd like me to do that."" He also said the controversy was not a big story in the US. This video can not be played May: We're not afraid to say when US has got it wrong Britain First, which was set up in 2011 by former members of the far-right British National Party (BNP), uses social media to gain attention for what it calls the ""Islamification of the UK"". Responding to Mr Trump's interview, Ms Fransen said she believed he had been ""railroaded"" into offering to apologise. She said: ""The fact is Donald Trump retweeted those because they are a matter of national and worldwide security. ""Islamic terrorism is affecting us all and he's been railroaded into saying he would offer an apology."" Ms Fransen said if she was really a ""horrible, nasty racist"" the US president ""would condemn me"". But she added: ""It's not true."" Speaking to ITV after the interview, Morgan said it was ""right and proper"" that Mr Trump should apologise, adding: ""I think this is a significant climbdown by the president"". The pair have been amiable since Morgan, who has described the president as a ""good friend"", won the US reality show Celebrity Apprentice in 2008 - which was judged by Mr Trump. Brendan Cox, whose wife Jo Cox was murdered by an extremist who shouted ""Britain First"" as he fired his gun, praised Morgan for pushing for an apology. ""Not many have succeeded in getting one,"" said Mr Cox, who was among those who rebuked Mr Trump for promoting the far-right group. Allow Twitter content?

He spoke of his ""love"" for the UK and for Scotland in particular, which he described as a ""very special place"", despitecancelling a planned visit to the UK in February. Asked about whether some people were opposed to a UK visit, Mr Trump said: ""I hadn't heard about banning, I think a lot of the people in your country like what I stand for, [including] tough borders."" Mr Trump added that he had a ""very good relationship"" with the UK prime minister, who he met in Davos shortly before the interview on Thursday. ""A lot of people think we don't,"" he said. In anearlier exchange with the PM in Davos, Switzerland, President Trump told Mrs May: ""We love your country.""

"The BBC's China editor Carrie Gracie has resigned from her post, citing pay inequality with male colleagues. In an open letter, Ms Gracie - who has been at the BBC for more than 30 years - accused the corporation of having a ""secretive and illegal pay culture"". She said the BBC was facing a ""crisis of trust"", after it was revealed two-thirds of its stars earning more than Â£150,000 were male. The BBC said there was ""no systemic discrimination against women"". Ms Gracie said she left her role as editor of the corporation's Beijing bureau last week, but would remain with the BBC. She said she would return to her former post in the TV newsroom ""where I expect to be paid equally"". Ms Gracie is co-presenting BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Monday. In the letter, posted on her blog,,externalMs Gracie - a China specialist who is fluent in Mandarin - said ""the BBC belongs to you, the licence fee payer. ""I believe you have a right to know that it is breaking equality law and resisting pressure for a fair and transparent pay structure."" How much do BBC stars earn? BBC pay: What else did we learn? In July last year, the BBC was forced to reveal the salaries of all employees earning more than Â£150,000 a year. Ms Gracie said she was dismayed to discover the BBC's two male international editors earned ""at least 50% more"" than its two female counterparts. US editor Jon Sopel earned Â£200,000-Â£249,999, it was revealed, while Middle East editor Jeremy Bowen earned Â£150,000-Â£199,999. Ms Gracie was not on the list, meaning her salary was less than Â£150,000. A letter calling for equal pay -published in the Telegraph,external- was later signed by both Ms Gracie and BBC Europe editor, Katya Adler. In her open letter, Ms Gracie said: ""The Equality Act 2010 states that men and women doing equal work must receive equal pay. ""But last July I learned that in the previous financial year, the two men earned at least 50% more than the two women. ""Despite the BBC's public insistence that my appointment demonstrated its commitment to gender equality, and despite my own insistence that equality was a condition of taking up the post, my managers had yet again judged that women's work was worth much less than men's."" This video can not be played Carrie Gracie returns to Beijing Ms Gracie said she asked for the four international editors to be paid equally. ""Instead the BBC offered me a big pay rise which remained far short of equality,"" she added. ""I believe I am very well paid already - especially as someone working for a publicly funded organisation. ""I simply want the BBC to abide by the law and value men and women equally."" She said ""patience and good will are running out"" among female staff. BBC media editor Amol Rajan said Ms Gracie's resignation was a ""big, big headache"" for the corporation. Michelle Stanistreet, general secretary of the National Union of Journalists, said it was ""no surprise"" that Ms Gracie was not prepared to stay silent about the ""scourge of unequal pay"" at the BBC. ""[The letter] makes it clear what a difficult decision it has been to speak out about what she calls a crisis of trust at the BBC, but why it is vital that the British public are clear about why she has been forced to resign her post."" On Twitter, many people, including BBC journalists, have expressed support for Ms Gracie using the hashtag#IStandWithCarrie,external, echoing the #BBCWomen hashtag that was prominent last summer.

"This video can not be played Trump: I would certainly apologise if you would like me to do that US President Donald Trump has said he is prepared to apologise for retweeting posts from a British far-right group. In an interview with ITV's Piers Morgan, Mr Trump said he knew ""nothing"" about Britain First beforesharing three of its videos in November. ""If you are telling me they're horrible people, horrible, racist people, I would certainly apologise if you'd like me to do that,"" he told Morgan. The interview, held in Davos, will be broadcast on 28 January at 22:00 GMT. The president's sharing of the controversial videos to his 40 million followers sparked aTwitter row with the UK prime minister, who criticised the move. ""I'm very clear that retweeting from Britain First was the wrong thing to do,"" Mrs May said, prompting Mr Trump to instruct the PM to focus on ""terrorism"" in the UK instead. Asked if he regretted the tweets, Mr Trump said, ""it was done because I am a big believer in fighting radical Islamic terror"". But he insisted he knew ""nothing about"" Britain First before sharing posts by the group's deputy leader Jayda Fransen - who isfacing a trial in April, accused of using threatening, abusive or insulting words at a protest in Belfast last year. ""I know nothing about them, I don't want to be involved with people [like that],"" Mr Trump told Morgan. Who has Trump criticised on Twitter? Davos shrugs off President Trump's visit Trump and his social media 'filter bubble' One of the videos retweeted by Mr Trump shows unverified footage of a ""Muslim migrant"" attacking a young Dutch man on crutches, with another showing a man smashing a statue of the Virgin Mary. The third video, originating from riots that took place in Egypt in 2013, shows a man being pushed from the top of a building. Mr Trump told Morgan: ""Here's what's fair - if you're telling me they're horrible people, horrible racist people, I would certainly apologise if you'd like me to do that."" He also said the controversy was not a big story in the US. This video can not be played May: We're not afraid to say when US has got it wrong Britain First, which was set up in 2011 by former members of the far-right British National Party (BNP), uses social media to gain attention for what it calls the ""Islamification of the UK"". Responding to Mr Trump's interview, Ms Fransen said she believed he had been ""railroaded"" into offering to apologise. She said: ""The fact is Donald Trump retweeted those because they are a matter of national and worldwide security. ""Islamic terrorism is affecting us all and he's been railroaded into saying he would offer an apology."" Ms Fransen said if she was really a ""horrible, nasty racist"" the US president ""would condemn me"". But she added: ""It's not true."" Speaking to ITV after the interview, Morgan said it was ""right and proper"" that Mr Trump should apologise, adding: ""I think this is a significant climbdown by the president"". The pair have been amiable since Morgan, who has described the president as a ""good friend"", won the US reality show Celebrity Apprentice in 2008 - which was judged by Mr Trump. Brendan Cox, whose wife Jo Cox was murdered by an extremist who shouted ""Britain First"" as he fired his gun, praised Morgan for pushing for an apology. ""Not many have succeeded in getting one,"" said Mr Cox, who was among those who rebuked Mr Trump for promoting the far-right group. Allow Twitter content?

He spoke of his ""love"" for the UK and for Scotland in particular, which he described as a ""very special place"", despitecancelling a planned visit to the UK in February. Asked about whether some people were opposed to a UK visit, Mr Trump said: ""I hadn't heard about banning, I think a lot of the people in your country like what I stand for, [including] tough borders."" Mr Trump added that he had a ""very good relationship"" with the UK prime minister, who he met in Davos shortly before the interview on Thursday. ""A lot of people think we don't,"" he said. In anearlier exchange with the PM in Davos, Switzerland, President Trump told Mrs May: ""We love your country."" He also said the US and UK were ""joined at the hip"" on military matters, while Mrs May said they stood ""shoulder to shoulder"" in facing shared threats.

"Plastic bottle wedged in the coral reef Plastic is one of the biggest threats to the future of coral reefs after ocean warming, say scientists. More than 11 billion items of plastic were found on a third of coral reefs surveyed in the Asia-Pacific region. This figure is predicted to increase to more than 15 billion by 2025. Plastic raises by 20-fold the risk of disease outbreaks on coral reefs, according to research. Plastic bags, bottles and rice sacks were among the items found. ""Plastic is one of the biggest threats in the ocean at the moment, I would say, apart from climate change,"" said Dr Joleah Lamb of Cornell University in Ithaca, US. ""It's sad how many pieces of plastic there are in the coral reefs ...if we can start targeting those big polluters of plastic, hopefully we can start reducing the amount that is going on to these reefs."" More than 275 million people rely on coral reefs for food, coastal protection, tourism income, and cultural importance. Infected coral snagged in plastic It's thought that plastic allows diseases that prey on the marine invertebrates that make-up coral reefs to flourish. Branching or finger-like forms of corals are most likely to get entangled in plastic debris. These are important habitats for fish and fisheries, the scientists say. ""A lot of times we come across big rice sacks or draping plastic bags,"" said Dr Lamb, who led the study. ""What we do find is these corals with a lot of complexity like branches and finger-like corals will become eight times more likely to be entangled in these types of plastics."" In the study, published in the journalScience,external, international researchers surveyed more than 150 reefs from four countries in the Asia-Pacific region between 2011 and 2014. Plastic debris on the beach in Sulawesi, Indonesia Plastic was found on one-third of the coral reefs surveyed. Reefs near Indonesia were loaded with most plastic, while Australian reefs showed the lowest concentration. Thailand and Myanmar were in the middle. ""The country's estimated amount of mismanaged plastics - so the way they deal with their plastic waste - was a strong predictor of how much we would see on the reef,"" said Dr Lamb. Coral reefs face many threats. Coral bleaching is caused by unusually warm water. Coral polyps loose algae from their tissues, which drains them of their colour. They may recover if temperature changes are reversed in a reasonably short time, but this process can take many years. In the case of diseases, organisms attack coral, leading to likely death. Previous research has found that plastic debris can stress coral through blocking out light and oxygen, thereby giving pathogens a chance to take hold. Plastic floating over corals Based on projections of plastic waste going into the ocean, the researchers suggest that the number of plastic items snagged on Asia-Pacific corals may increase from 11.1 billion to 15.7 billion plastic items by 2025. An estimated 4.8 to 12.7 million tonnes of plastic waste enter the ocean in a single year. More than three-quarters of this plastic is thought to originate on land. Follow Helenon Twitter,external.

"Jacob Rees-Mogg is attacking the government over Brexit Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg has called for a fundamental change in ministers' tone on Brexit, accusing UK negotiators of being ""cowed by the EU"". The Eurosceptic backbencher said in a speech that ""close alignment"" with the EU after Brexit would be unacceptable. Chancellor Philip Hammond, meanwhile, has said he hopes the UK and EU economies will only move ""very modestly"" apart after Brexit. He said they were already ""completely interconnected and aligned"". Laura kuenssberg: Tories' Brexit agonies resurface David Davis to set out his transition deal aims Brexit transition not a deferral - Davis BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the war of words went right to the heart of Mrs May's struggle to keep her party together over its biggest project - how the UK will leave the EU. While the majority of ministers thought she was the only person able to do it, the mood in the party had turned sour in recent weeks with one senior Conservative MP saying they were ""in the mood for regime change"". The UK is due to leave the European Union in March 2019, and negotiations are taking place between the two sides. One of the key questions is how close their trading relationship will be once the UK has left. Mr Rees-Mogg, one of the leading Eurosceptic voices on the Conservative benches, has recently become the chairman of the European Research Group of Tory MPs. In his speech, he warned against Brexit being treated like a ""damage limitation exercise"". People ""did not vote for the management of decline"", he said. ""They voted for hope and opportunity and politicians must now deliver it."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The North East Somerset MP said some of the ""really obvious opportunities"" to improve people's lives from Brexit were at risk, if a model similar to the EU's single market and customs union was adopted. This would leave the UK ""divested of even the limited influence we currently have"". Mr Rees-Mogg also said businesses will suffer unless the UK can set its own regulations, independent of the EU. And he criticised the UK negotiators, who are led by Brexit Secretary David Davis. This video can not be played David Davis v Jacob Rees-Mogg on Brexit transition ""For too long our negotiators seemed to have been cowed by the EU,"" he argued. ""Their approach seems to be that we must accept what the EU will allow us to do and build from there. This is no way to negotiate and it is no way for this country to behave."" Mr Rees-Mogg toldBBC Radio 5live's Brexitcastthat his aim in criticising the government's approach to Brexit was to ""support the prime minister against naysayers"". Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Mr Hammond said the UK was not seeking an ""off-the-shelf"" model to replace its membership of the EU single market and customs union. The starting point is a position of ""high levels of bilateral trade in goods and services,"" he said. ""So instead of doing what we're normally doing in the trade negotiations - taking two divergent economies with low levels of trade and trying to bring them closer together to enhance that trade - we are taking two completely interconnected and aligned economies with high levels of trade between them, and selectively, moving them, hopefully very modestly, apart. ""And so we should be confident of reaching something much more ambitious than any free trade agreement has ever achieved."" A Cabinet source told the BBC: ""The UK is leaving the EU, the sooner Hammond realises that the better. Very modest changes are not what the 52% voted for."" Eurosceptic Tory backbencher Bernard Jenkin told the BBC: ""Either the chancellor's been just a little careless in the ambiguity of his remarks or, rather as we suspect, the Treasury's got rather a different agenda. But I think it would be much easier for the prime minister to do her job if everyone just stuck to her script and I think that is what he should do."" He added that while he didn't want one ""maybe [the prime minister] needs another reshuffle in order to give herself more ministers who support her policy"" but denied he was suggesting Mr Hammond be sacked.

Former Conservative MP and Scottish secretary Lord Forsyth told the BBC's Question Time that the prime minister ""needs to get a grip on the cabinet and the cabinet needs to get behind her"". He added that Mr Hammond seems to be saying ""something that's completely at odds with what the prime minister said in her Lancaster House speech."" Downing Street said Theresa May had used major speeches to talk about the ""opportunities that Brexit will provide for the country"", and that the government was confident of securing these opportunities in the next phase of negotiations. Asked whether she agreed with Mr Hammond's comments, the spokesman said: ""The cabinet has signed up to the vision the PM has set out in her speeches.""

"This video can not be played Firefighters tackle the blaze in Miryang At least 37 people have been killed and about 130 injured in a fire at a hospital in South Korea. The blaze is thought to have started in the emergency room at Sejong Hospital in the south-eastern city of Miryang. Nearly 200 patients were inside the building and an adjoining nursing home when the fire broke out in the morning. It is South Korea's deadliest fire in almost a decade and the death toll is expected to rise with several of the injured in critical condition. Firefighters said the victims appeared to have died from smoke inhalation. Three hospital medical staff - a doctor, nurse and nursing assistant - are among the victims. Authorities have given varying death tolls, with police earlier saying 41 had died. But the officials later corrected this, saying some victims were counted twice. The fire completely gutted the hospital's first floor, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reports. Miryang is about 270km (168 miles) south-east of the capital, Seoul. The hospital specialised in caring for elderly people with long-term needs, as well as other patients, reported the daily JoongAng Ilbo - and reports suggest many patients would have been too ill or old to escape alone. The fire completely gutted the hospital's ground floor Many of those inside the burning building were elderly The paper quoted a surviving patient, Jang Yeong-jae, as saying that he was on the second floor when nurses screamed ""Fire!"" in the hallway and urged people to evacuate. ""But when I opened the exit door, the whole stairway was filled with dark smoke and I couldn't see a thing,"" he said. ""Everybody was running around in panic, falling over and screaming as smoke filled the rooms."" Mr Jang said he ripped open window screens and escaped down a ladder put up by firefighters. ""There were so many elderly patients on other floors... I wonder if they escaped safely,"" Mr Jang's wife was quoted as saying. Fire chief Choi Man-woo told reporters the cause of the fire was not yet known. The hospital building did not have any fire sprinklers installed, local media said. Under current laws, the building was not required to have sprinklers, but they were in the process of being fitted in the adjoining nursing home. A new law that is due to come into force on 30 June will make sprinklers compulsory for nursing homes. Most of the casualties were due to smoke inhalation Mr Choi said the fire started around 07:30 local time (22:30 GMT on Thursday) and was put out in about three hours. Ninety-four patients from the adjacent nursing home were safely evacuated. South Korean President Moon Jae-in arranged an emergency meeting to discuss ways of dealing with the fire. Senior officials from both governing and opposition parties travelled to Miryang to offer their condolences and call for a thorough investigation. It is not known what caused the fire Scores of patients were inside the building and a neighbouring nursing home The hospital has been operating since 2008 and about 35 medical staff work there, according to provincial officials. The fire comes just a month after29 people in the South Korean city of Jecheon were killedin a blaze at a public gym. The owner and manager of the building were later arrested over multiple safety lapses, including malfunctioning sprinkler systems.

"This video can not be played Trump: ""I don't know that [peace talks] will ever take place"" US President Donald Trump has threatened to halt aid to the Palestinians if they do not agree to take part in peace talks. The state department confirmed he was talking about aid for economic and security assistance. Mr Trump accused the Palestinians of ""disrespecting"" the US, and said: ""Why should we do something for them when they do nothing for us?"" The Palestinians have rejected the US as a neutral broker in peace talks. They are furious at Washington's controversial decision in December to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Former Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said of the US president's latest comments: ""Trump could buy many things with his money, but he won't be able to buy the dignity of our nation."" Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos in Switzerland, Mr Trump said the US gives the Palestinians ""hundreds of millions of dollars in aid and support"" a year. He chastised the Palestinian leadership for ""disrespecting... our great Vice-President""Mike Pence by refusing to meet with him in the region earlier in the week. And he said he was the first US president to link the issue of aid funding to the peace process. ""That money is on the table and it's not going to them unless they sit down and negotiate peace,"" he said, sitting beside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. ""I can tell you that Israel does want to make peace and they're [the Palestinians] going to have to want to make peace too or we're going to have nothing to do with it any longer."" Mr Trump accused Palestinian leaders of ""disrespecting"" US Vice-President Mike Pence The US announced earlier this month that it was withholding more than half of a tranche of funding for the UN agency supporting Palestinian refugees, amounting to about $65m (Â£46m). But the US state department later confirmed this was not the aid Mr Trump was referring too. He was instead talking about bilateral funding for economic support and some security training. US bilateral aid to the Palestinians amounted to $260m in 2016. By contrast, Israel receives more than $3bn in military aid per year from the US. Barbara Plett Usher, BBC News, State Department Correspondent This seems to be the first time the White House has used aid as a bargaining chip to try to force the Palestinians to negotiate peace. It's one way to ""shake things up"" in hopes of getting people ""back to the table,"" according to the state department spokesperson Heather Nauert. There would be at least a tremor if the US withheld the bilateral aid. Most of it goes to economic development projects, though some is also used to train security forces. But the practical outcome of Mr Trump's statement might be limited. Israel needs the PA to run the occupied territories and may counsel against weakening it. Politically this has made the Palestinians even more adamant about rejecting sole US leadership of any peace talks. Mr Trump's manoeuvre has also underscored the failure of President Mahmoud Abbas, who staked everything on the US-led process and now might have less than nothing to show for it. Perhaps this will be what it takes to ""shake up"" the ossified Palestinian leadership. The US president said his administration had a ""proposal for peace"" that was ""a great proposal for the Palestinians"" and suggested Israel was prepared to make some concessions. ""You won one point,"" he said to Mr Netanyahu, referring to Jerusalem, ""and you'll give up some points later on in the negotiation, if it ever takes place."" But he added: ""I don't know that they [peace talks] will ever take place."" The last round of on-off peace talks between the two sides collapsed amid acrimony in April 2014. Mr Trump stood by his decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital - a move that broke with decades of a US policy of neutrality on the issue and put it out of step with the rest of the international community. He told Mr Netanyahu: ""Israel has always supported the United States so what I did with Jerusalem was my honour."" And he reiterated his view that by taking ""Jerusalem off the [negotiating] table... we don't have to talk about it any more"" - suggesting it could move forward the peace process. ""They [the Palestinians] never got past Jerusalem,"" he said. This video can not be played Why the ancient city of Jerusalem is so important The status of Jerusalem goes to the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Israel regards Jerusalem as its ""eternal and undivided"" capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem - occupied by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war - as the capital of a future state. The Palestinian ambassador to the US said they were not being ""disrespectful of anybody... we were just respectful of our rights and defending our internationally endorsed rights"". Dr Husam Zomlot admitted that the lack of US aid would ""directly affect hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of innocent, vulnerable people all over the region"". But, he told the BBC, ""financial pressure for coercive political agendas does not work.. especially when our position is supported by the international community"". He said Mr Trump had not just ""taken Jerusalem off the table, he has taken the table altogether"". He called for an international table ""that can actually deliver us where we want to go"". Mr Abbas has dismissed previous threats by Mr Trump to cut US aid as ""blackmail"".He has also saidhe would not accept any peace plan proposed by the US. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has accused Donald Trump of ""blackmail"" over past threats to cut US aid Prime Minister Netanyahu was effusive in his praise of Mr Trump over his decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital. ""By recognising history, you've made history, and we will always remember that,"" he told the US president. He later told a meeting at Davos that ""under any peace agreement the capital of Israel will continue to be in Jerusalem"". He also said that ""the Palestinians should have all the power to govern themselves but none of the power to threaten us"". ""In any political arrangement the Jews must retain security control in the area, because otherwise you'll have [the Islamic State group] ... We have a mosaic of failed states in the Middle East, and we don't want another one,"" he continued.

"The BBC's China editor Carrie Gracie has resigned from her post, citing pay inequality with male colleagues. In an open letter, Ms Gracie - who has been at the BBC for more than 30 years - accused the corporation of having a ""secretive and illegal pay culture"". She said the BBC was facing a ""crisis of trust"", after it was revealed two-thirds of its stars earning more than Â£150,000 were male. The BBC said there was ""no systemic discrimination against women"". Ms Gracie said she left her role as editor of the corporation's Beijing bureau last week, but would remain with the BBC. She said she would return to her former post in the TV newsroom ""where I expect to be paid equally"". Ms Gracie is co-presenting BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Monday. In the letter, posted on her blog,,externalMs Gracie - a China specialist who is fluent in Mandarin - said ""the BBC belongs to you, the licence fee payer. ""I believe you have a right to know that it is breaking equality law and resisting pressure for a fair and transparent pay structure."" How much do BBC stars earn? BBC pay: What else did we learn? In July last year, the BBC was forced to reveal the salaries of all employees earning more than Â£150,000 a year. Ms Gracie said she was dismayed to discover the BBC's two male international editors earned ""at least 50% more"" than its two female counterparts. US editor Jon Sopel earned Â£200,000-Â£249,999, it was revealed, while Middle East editor Jeremy Bowen earned Â£150,000-Â£199,999. Ms Gracie was not on the list, meaning her salary was less than Â£150,000. A letter calling for equal pay -published in the Telegraph,external- was later signed by both Ms Gracie and BBC Europe editor, Katya Adler. In her open letter, Ms Gracie said: ""The Equality Act 2010 states that men and women doing equal work must receive equal pay. ""But last July I learned that in the previous financial year, the two men earned at least 50% more than the two women. ""Despite the BBC's public insistence that my appointment demonstrated its commitment to gender equality, and despite my own insistence that equality was a condition of taking up the post, my managers had yet again judged that women's work was worth much less than men's."" This video can not be played Carrie Gracie returns to Beijing Ms Gracie said she asked for the four international editors to be paid equally. ""Instead the BBC offered me a big pay rise which remained far short of equality,"" she added. ""I believe I am very well paid already - especially as someone working for a publicly funded organisation. ""I simply want the BBC to abide by the law and value men and women equally."" She said ""patience and good will are running out"" among female staff. BBC media editor Amol Rajan said Ms Gracie's resignation was a ""big, big headache"" for the corporation. Michelle Stanistreet, general secretary of the National Union of Journalists, said it was ""no surprise"" that Ms Gracie was not prepared to stay silent about the ""scourge of unequal pay"" at the BBC. ""[The letter] makes it clear what a difficult decision it has been to speak out about what she calls a crisis of trust at the BBC, but why it is vital that the British public are clear about why she has been forced to resign her post."" On Twitter, many people, including BBC journalists, have expressed support for Ms Gracie using the hashtag#IStandWithCarrie,external, echoing the #BBCWomen hashtag that was prominent last summer.

"Jacob Rees-Mogg is attacking the government over Brexit Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg has called for a fundamental change in ministers' tone on Brexit, accusing UK negotiators of being ""cowed by the EU"". The Eurosceptic backbencher said in a speech that ""close alignment"" with the EU after Brexit would be unacceptable. Chancellor Philip Hammond, meanwhile, has said he hopes the UK and EU economies will only move ""very modestly"" apart after Brexit. He said they were already ""completely interconnected and aligned"". Laura kuenssberg: Tories' Brexit agonies resurface David Davis to set out his transition deal aims Brexit transition not a deferral - Davis BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the war of words went right to the heart of Mrs May's struggle to keep her party together over its biggest project - how the UK will leave the EU. While the majority of ministers thought she was the only person able to do it, the mood in the party had turned sour in recent weeks with one senior Conservative MP saying they were ""in the mood for regime change"". The UK is due to leave the European Union in March 2019, and negotiations are taking place between the two sides. One of the key questions is how close their trading relationship will be once the UK has left. Mr Rees-Mogg, one of the leading Eurosceptic voices on the Conservative benches, has recently become the chairman of the European Research Group of Tory MPs. In his speech, he warned against Brexit being treated like a ""damage limitation exercise"". People ""did not vote for the management of decline"", he said. ""They voted for hope and opportunity and politicians must now deliver it."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The North East Somerset MP said some of the ""really obvious opportunities"" to improve people's lives from Brexit were at risk, if a model similar to the EU's single market and customs union was adopted. This would leave the UK ""divested of even the limited influence we currently have"". Mr Rees-Mogg also said businesses will suffer unless the UK can set its own regulations, independent of the EU. And he criticised the UK negotiators, who are led by Brexit Secretary David Davis. This video can not be played David Davis v Jacob Rees-Mogg on Brexit transition ""For too long our negotiators seemed to have been cowed by the EU,"" he argued. ""Their approach seems to be that we must accept what the EU will allow us to do and build from there. This is no way to negotiate and it is no way for this country to behave."" Mr Rees-Mogg toldBBC Radio 5live's Brexitcastthat his aim in criticising the government's approach to Brexit was to ""support the prime minister against naysayers"". Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Mr Hammond said the UK was not seeking an ""off-the-shelf"" model to replace its membership of the EU single market and customs union. The starting point is a position of ""high levels of bilateral trade in goods and services,"" he said. ""So instead of doing what we're normally doing in the trade negotiations - taking two divergent economies with low levels of trade and trying to bring them closer together to enhance that trade - we are taking two completely interconnected and aligned economies with high levels of trade between them, and selectively, moving them, hopefully very modestly, apart. ""And so we should be confident of reaching something much more ambitious than any free trade agreement has ever achieved."" A Cabinet source told the BBC: ""The UK is leaving the EU, the sooner Hammond realises that the better. Very modest changes are not what the 52% voted for."" Eurosceptic Tory backbencher Bernard Jenkin told the BBC: ""Either the chancellor's been just a little careless in the ambiguity of his remarks or, rather as we suspect, the Treasury's got rather a different agenda. But I think it would be much easier for the prime minister to do her job if everyone just stuck to her script and I think that is what he should do."" He added that while he didn't want one ""maybe [the prime minister] needs another reshuffle in order to give herself more ministers who support her policy"" but denied he was suggesting Mr Hammond be sacked.

"Ambassador JesÃºs Silva has been in Caracas for less than a year Venezuela has expelled the Spanish ambassador to Caracas, JesÃºs Silva FernÃ¡ndez, accusing him of interfering in its internal affairs. Spain has rejected the allegations and said it would reciprocate. The announcement comes after the European Union imposed a travel ban and froze the assets of seven senior Venezuelan officials. President NicolÃ¡s Maduro has accused Spain of pushing for the EU sanctions and plotting to oust him. The EU has expressed concern over human rights violations during anti-government protests in which more than 120 people were killed last year. On TuesdayVenezuela's Constituent Assembly announced that it was calling early presidential elections. Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza said the move was in reaction to the EU sanctions. The vote, which is traditionally held in December, will take place by the end of April. Mr Maduro told supporters that the US and Spain were trying to bring down his government Mr Maduro, who will stand for another six-year term, said it was time ""to put an end to the imperialist threat"". Venezuela has the world's highest inflation rate and has for years struggled with the shortage of basic goods, including medicines. Mr Maduro blames ""international economic sabotage"" - which he said was led by Spain and the US - for the situation. ""Donald Trump won't make decisions in Venezuela, [Spanish Prime Minister] Mariano Rajoy won't make decisions in Venezuela. The people of Venezuela will,"" he told thousands of his supporters at a rally in Caracas on Tuesday. Last monthVenezuela expelled the Brazilian and the Canadian ambassadors to Caracas, also accusing them of interference.

"The billionaire investor George Soros has criticised tech ""monopolies"" such as Facebook and Google, calling them a threat to democracy. At his annual dinner at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Mr Soros warned that social media platforms were ""obstacles to innovation"". He raised concerns about their power to shape people's attentions. However, he predicted their days were numbered because tax policy and regulation would catch up with them. Mr Soros also called the Trump administration a ""danger to the world"", adding that he believed the president would be gone by 2020 ""or sooner"". But the outspoken financier reserved his strongest criticism for what he called the ""unprecedented and transformative"" effects of large internet firms. ""The power to shape people's attention is increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few companies,"" Mr Soros told assembled guests. Referencing Google and Facebook several times during his speech, he said: ""It takes a real effort to assert and defend what John Stuart Mill called 'the freedom of mind'. ""There is a possibility that once lost, people who grow up in the digital age will have difficulty in regaining it."" More from Davos on the BBC He cautioned that this would have ""far-reaching political consequences"", and had already played a large role in the election of Donald Trump. Facebook declined to comment, while Google did not immediately return a request for comment. The 87-year-old repeatedly praised EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager, whom he said would be the social media companies' ""nemesis"". Mr Soros referenced Google and Facebook several times during his speech Ms Vestager has become best known for going after US tech giants, slapping charges on Google, Amazon and Apple. Mr Soros said the EU, which has no internet giants of its own, was best placed to ""protect society against them"", whereas US regulators, he maintained, were too weak. ""Internet monopolies have neither the will nor the inclination to protect society against the consequences of their actions,"" he emphasised. The Hungary-born hedge fund manager, who initially became famous for having made $1bn by betting on the devaluation of the pound in 1992, heads several foundations devoted to ""defending open societies from their enemies"". Mr Soros, a Holocaust survivor, opened his speech by disclosing that he found the current moment in history ""rather painful"". ""Open societies are in crisis, and various forms of dictatorships and mafia states, exemplified by Putin's Russia, are on the rise."" But he predicted that Donald Trump, whom he previously branded a ""would-be dictator,"" might not last to the end of his term. ""I expect a Democratic landslide in 2018,"" Mr Soros asserted.

"This video can not be played Special correspondent Ed Thomas has witnessed the reality of knife crime The number of violent crimes and sex offences recorded by police in England and Wales has risen sharply over the past year, figures suggest. Knife crime and robbery also increased in the 12 months to September 2017 compared with the previous year, theOffice for National Statistics said.,external About 5.3 million crimes were recorded in all in that 12-month period, up 14%. However, the separate Crime Survey, based on people's experiences, suggests crime continues to fall. This survey, based on interviews with 35,000 households in England and Wales, includes crimes that people do not report to police. Nine charts on rising knife crime in England and Wales Crime survey v police statistics - how do they compare? Can Scotland help London stop violent deaths? On a knife edge: Rising violence in London The latest police figures for the 12 months to September from 44 forces show: 68,968 robbery offences, up29% 138,045 sex offences, up23% 37,443 knife crime offences, up21% 1,291,405 violent crime offences, up20% There were 37,443 knife crimes and 6,694 gun crime offences recorded in the year to September. The number of offences involving a knife or a sharp instrument had been falling since 2011 but started rising again over the past three years, the ONS said. This contrasts with the Crime Survey which found that most crimes either fell or were at a similar level. However the ONS says higher-harm violent offences, such as knife crime occur in relatively low volumes, and also tend to be concentrated in cities and are therefore not ""well-measured"" by the Crime Survey. Excluding the Hillsborough stadium deaths and last year's terror attacks from the data, 57 more people were killed or murdered than the previous year - the highest total since 2008-9. The 96 cases of manslaughter from Hillsborough stadium in 1989 were only included in crime figures in 2016, after an inquest ruled that the football fans had been unlawfully killed. By BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw Although there's likely to be a dispute about the accuracy of the police crime figures because they hinge, to some extent, on the way forces log offences, how pro-active they are and the willingness of victims to come forward, they clearly demonstrate a rapidly rising caseload. For example, recorded sexual offences and violent crimes have more than doubled in three years. At the same time, the number of police officers has continued to fall: in the 12 months to last September, down 930 to 121,929. The Home Office says that's the lowest figure since comparable records began in 1996. That combination - rising crime, declining police numbers - is creating enormous strain for forces. But it's unclear whether the smaller police workforce is contributing to the growth in violent crime, particularly what the ONS says are the ""genuine"" increases in knife crime and firearm offences. This video can not be played Knife crime was up by 26% year-on-year - an increasing number of teenagers in London are being injured by knives There were also increases in vehicle-related theft offences, which were up 18% to 443,577, and burglary, which rose by 8% to 433,110, police data showed. Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said the figures were ""truly shocking"" and should ""put an end to government complacency on crime"". ""The Tories are failing in a basic duty to protect the public,"" she added. The Police and Crime Commissioner for the West Midlands, David Jamieson, said his force had lost more than 2,000 uniformed officers since 2010 and his budget had been cut by 25%. ""Any sensible person can see if you take away a quarter of the budget, you can't carry on protecting the public in the same way,"" he told BBC News. He anticipates having to lose a further 150 officers this year. Police Federation of England and Wales General Secretary Andy Fittes said:  ""The reality is there are around 21,000 fewer officers than there were in 2010 and they are having to deal with an ever-increasing number of crimes."" ""To say crime has fallen is smoke and mirrors,"" he added. He added that police officers have ""numerous other roles"" not covered in today's statistics - such as counter-terrorism, sex offender management, policing football matches and missing person searches.

"This video can not be played Undocumented immigrants: ""Life in the US is like a rollercoaster"" The White House has outlined an immigration plan for nearly two million people to become US citizens in exchange for funding for a controversial border wall with Mexico. The framework was suggested by a senior Trump aide, ahead of legislative negotiations with Democrats. The proposed bill, to be unveiled on Monday, requests $25bn (Â£17.6bn) in funds for a wall on the Mexican border. The Democrats, who oppose funding for the wall, have criticised the plan. The details emerged in a conference call on Thursday between White House policy chief Stephen Miller and Republican congressional aides, according to US media. Mr Miller reportedly described the White House plan as a ""dramatic concession"". The blueprint sets out a 10-12-year path to citizenship for 1.8 million people. This video can not be played Can US border agents lawfully search you? This includes some 700,000 so-called Dreamers, immigrants who illegally entered the US as children and were protected from deportation under an Obama-era programme, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca). The other 1.1 million would be immigrants who did not apply for Daca but are eligible for the scheme. The White House framework also seeks to end two other initiatives often criticised by President Donald Trump. It proposes to curtail so-called chain migration, permitting US residents only to get visas for their spouse and children, not for extended family members. The White House also wants to scrap the diversity visa lottery, under which 50,000 people from around the world every year win Green Cards at random. What is the diversity green card lottery? This video can not be played Am I American yet? Republican US Senator Tom Cotton, one of the most conservative voices on immigration policy, welcomed Mr Trump's plan. ""The president's framework is generous and humane, while also being responsible,"" the Arkansas senator said in a statement. Democrats were less impressed. ""Dreamers should not be held hostage to President Trump's crusade to tear families apart and waste billions of American tax dollars on an ineffective wall,"" Senate Democratic whip Dick Durbin said in a statement. New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez was among those tweeting their frustration. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

United We Dream, a young immigrants' organisation, called the White House plan ""a white supremacist ransom note"". Mr Trump cancelled the programme in September and gave Congress a March deadline to come up with a new plan. The president has so far rejected bipartisan proposals that have been presented to him. Congress' failure to secure a deal on immigration triggered a brief shutdown of the federal government over the weekend. This video can not be played The missing - consequences of Trump's immigration crackdown On Wednesday, Mr Trump said he was optimistic that a deal on immigration would be reached that included keeping the so-called Dreamers in the country. He added that it was an ""incentive"" for so-called Dreamers to work hard and ""do a great job"". The Republican president has made it clear that in exchange for making a concession to help accomplish a Democratic priority, he wants the party's backing for his signature campaign promise to deliver a border wall. However, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer this week withdrew an offer of funding for Mr Trump's proposed border barrier. The other 'Dreamers' facing uncertain future Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington There's a quote from Mark Twain that if you don't like the weather in New England, just wait five minutes. The same could be said of Donald Trump's position on immigration. One day he'll accept - and take the heat for - any bipartisan deal Congress might strike. Later, he insists any agreement must include funding for his border wall and sweeping changes to legal immigration. During the shutdown, he painted Democratic efforts to get a Daca vote as support for ""unchecked illegal immigration"". On Wednesday, he expressed an openness to giving Daca recipients a path to citizenship - something many of his supporters deride as amnesty for lawbreakers. This could be part of some grand ""art of the deal"" presidential strategy, which will only be revealed in hindsight. Or perhaps congressional parties should focus on people like chief of staff John Kelly, who stayed in Washington to negotiate while the president hob-nobs with the global elite in Davos.

"Sky plans to make all its channels and content available online, giving customers the option of doing away with a satellite dish. The pay TV company already offers some programming online on its Sky Go and Now TV services and through Sky boxes. Sky said offering the option was a ""major development"" that would let it enter new markets. It hopes that making its hundreds of channels more widely available will increase both revenue and profits. Italy will be its first market to get all Sky channels online, followed by Austria, with the UK expected to follow later this year or in 2019. Sky is not proposing to stop broadcasting by satellite. The move will allow customers who cannot have a dish or do not want one to get Sky, a spokesperson said. A Sky box will still be required. The company's move is a response to greater competition from the likes of streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon. Jeremy Darroch, Sky chief executive, said the consumer environment was expected to remain ""challenging"". Sky-Fox deal 'not in public interest' What are the issues in Fox's Sky deal? Reporting itsresults for the six months to 31 December,external, Sky said average revenue per user in the UK and Ireland - by far its biggest market - fell Â£1 to Â£46 a month. However, the number of customers leaving - the ""churn"" rate - decreased from 11.6% at the end of 2016 to 11.2%. Sky said the fall was a result of more customers taking its premium Sky Q box and a ""more disciplined and targeted approach to discounting"". Julia Stiles stars in the Sky Atlantic drama Riviera Mr Darroch said there was good growth at both the top end of the market, with its premium Sky Q box now in 2 million homes in the UK and Ireland, and the bottom end with Now TV. Now TV offers sports, movies and entertainment channels over the internet more flexibly and cheaply than through a Sky subscription. A new USB stick will allow customers to watch Now TV content on any television - including EU countries when an expected change to ""geoblocking"" rules comes into effect this summer. The number of Sky retail customers in the UK and Ireland rose by 255,000 to 12.9 million, while Sky added 365,000 new customers to bring the total to 22.9 million. Like-for-like revenues rose 5% to Â£6.7bn in the half-year and pre-tax profit jumped by Â£106m to Â£448m compared with the same period in the previous year. Last year 21st Century Fox made a bid to buy the 61% of Sky that it does not own. Both companies are controlled by media mogul Rupert Murdoch. This week the the UK's Competition and Markets Authority ruled that the proposed takeover wasnot in the public interest on grounds of media plurality. Since Fox made the bid it has agreed to be taken over by Disney, so the US media giant could end up owning Sky. Sky shares rose 1.1% to Â£10.35 in afternoon trading in London, valuing the company at Â£17.7bn. Sky-Fox deal 'not in public interest' What are the issues in Fox's Sky deal?

"Police and guards have been deployed to keep order Hardline Hindus angered by a Bollywood film have threatened cinema-goers and clashed with police in northern India. Reports say a cinema owner in Uttar Pradesh was attacked. Several other theatres in the state and in neighbouring Bihar were also targeted. Hardline Hindu groups allege the film Padmaavat is disrespectful of their culture by depicting a romance between a Hindu queen and a Muslim king. The producers deny this. The release was delayed for two months by protests. Many theatres across India have said that they will not screen the film, fearing further violence. But despite the threats, the film still opened in 5,000 cinemas in many parts of the country. Some cinema-goers in Delhi said there was nothing controversial in the movie. ""All the ruckus that is going on is uncalled for,"" one viewer told the BBC after watching the film. This video can not be played Deepika Padukone plays Queen Padmavati in the film The Supreme Court rejected a bid by four states that wanted the film banned for security reasons, saying it was their responsibility to ensure law and order. On Wednesday, footage of mobs attacking a bus carrying students in Gurgaon, near Delhi, caused outrage. It is unclear why the mob attacked the vehicle, which was clearly marked as a school bus.A video of the attack,externalshowed scared students ducking under the seat as the bus was pelted with stones. No children were injured in the incident, but protesters burned a number of other buses, and have also vandalised cinemas over the last few days. Bollywood stars Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh play the lead roles. The film tells the story of 14th Century Muslim emperor Alauddin Khilji's attack on a kingdom after he was smitten by the beauty of its queen, Padmavati, who belonged to the Hindu Rajput caste. Bollywood memoir kicks up storm about being gay in India Bollywood film accused of distorting history Why is Bollywood film PK controversial? Hindu groups and a Rajput caste organisation allege that the movie includes a scene in which the Muslim king dreams of becoming intimate with the Hindu queen. But director Sanjay Leela Bhansali has saidthe film does not feature such a ""dream sequence"" at all,external. But rumours of such a scene were enough to enrage right-wing Hindu groups. Divya Arya, Women Affairs, BBC World service, Delhi The film Padmaavat does not depict a romance between a Hindu queen and a Muslim king, as has been alleged by protesters over the last few months. Neither is there a dream sequence between the two, nor does the Hindu queen Padmavati dance in front of strangers or wear outfits that are revealing. In fact, the outrage against the film should be directed at the glamorised portrayal of mass self-immolation, or ""jauhar"", led by Padmavati. She and hundreds of women take their lives by jumping into a fire to escape being captured by the Muslim king. The women's desperate end is celebrated and glorified in a violent build-up to the film's climax, again emphasising the importance of the community and a husband's honour over the life of a woman. While Khilji is a historical figure, historians believe that Padmavati is fictional. The name of the queen, and the plot of the film, are believed to be based on an epic poem, Padmaavat, by 16th Century poet Malik Muhammad Jayasi. Some cinema owners are not screening the film as they fear more violence The film has sparked angry protests for months The poem extols the virtue of Padmavati who committed jauhar to protect her honour from Khilji who had killed her husband, the Rajput king, in a battle. Jauhar, the mass self-immolation by women to avoid enslavement and rape by foreign invaders, is believed to have originated some 700 years ago among the ruling class or Rajputs in India. Women in the community set themselves alight after their men were defeated in battles to avoid being taken by the victors. But it came to be seen as a measure of wifely devotion in later years.

"This video can not be played Former hostess: ""There were girls sat on people's laps being fondled and groped"" Theresa May has said she was ""appalled"" by reports women were groped at a men-only gala and was ""not happy"" that an event like that took place. The Prime Minister said she would continue to work to ensure women were ""accepted and respected as equals"". Mrs May will also consider whether any changes were needed to non-disclosure agreements, Downing Street said. The legal documents were signed by the hostesses who worked at last Thursday's Presidents Club event, it was reported. Non-disclosure agreements are legal documents signed between two parties to share confidential information. The Presidents Club said it was closing and would no longer hold eventsafter an undercover reporter for the Financial Times,externalrevealed hostesses were subject to groping and lewd comments at the dinner in London. Time up on men-only networking events? RAre charities allowed to return money? Scandal-hit club shuts amid groping claims 'Flirtatious and handsy': More women speak out Mrs May said that it wasn't just the event that worried her, but ""what it says about the wider issue in society - about attitudes to women"". ""I thought that sort of approach to women - that objectification of women - was something we were leaving behind,"" she said. ""We've made progress, but it's very clear that there's a lot more for us to do."" Meanwhile, the University of Bolton said its vice-chancellor George Holmes, who was a first-time guest at the dinner, ""was uncomfortable with the totally unexpected influx of hostess staff and certain auction lots"". After speaking to hostesses, Prof Holmes raised concerns with a staff team leader that some of her staff were uncomfortable, the university said. ""Although Prof Holmes did not witness any of the assaults subsequently alleged in the press, he chose to leave as soon as was politely possible at the end of the charity auction,"" a statement said. This video can not be played Theresa May said more work needed to be done for women ""to be accepted and respected as equals"". Earlier, children and families minister Nadhim Zahawi was reprimanded by No 10 for attending the event. The BBC understands Mr Zahawi was called to Downing Street on Wednesday to meet chief whip Julian Smith. He said he went to the fundraiser but left early. Mrs May said she accepted Mr Zahawi's explanation. The Metropolitan Police said it had not received any complaints about last Thursday's dinner. The dinner and auction - which has taken place annually for more than 30 years and raised Â£20m for children's charities - was held at the Dorchester Hotel in central London and attended by senior figures in business and finance. This video can not be played How The Presidents Club scandal unfolded The FT revealed the 130 hostesses were told to wear skimpy black outfits with matching underwear and high heels, and made to sign a non-disclosure agreement before starting work. Auction prizes included lunch with Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, a trip to a London strip club and plastic surgery ""to spice up your wife"". It is understood that Mr Johnson did not agree to support the event and will not take part in the lunch. The Presidents Club said it would distribute its remaining funds to children's charities, although some - including Great Ormond Street children's hospital - have said they will return any donations they have already received. The Charity Commission also said it was investigating the claims ""as a matter of urgency"". On Wednesday, Mr Zahawi, MP for Stratford-on-Avon, tweeted that he arrived at the event at 20:00 GMT and left at 21:35 GMT as he ""felt uncomfortable"", but said he did not see any of the ""horrific"" events reported. He also tweeted that he would never attend a men-only function again. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said Mr Zahawi should ""consider his position"" after attending a ""clearly horrible event"". ""It's very surprising to me that he didn't report back on what happened,"" she said. Environment Secretary Michael Gove defended Mr Zahawi on Twitter. Allow Twitter content?

The minister for digital and the creative industries, Margot James, told Newsnight that the event represented ""the very worst form of sexism with a smile on its face"". But she stood by Mr Zahawi and his claim of an early exit. This video can not be played Labour MP Jess Philips: 'Lads' culture has no place in country' But Labour's Sarah Jones said Mr Zahawi should resign if he did not report his concerns and had attended on previous occasions. Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner also called for an investigation into his attendance. Earlier on Wednesday, a Downing Street spokesman said the prime minister had confidence in Mr Zahawi and he was not being referred for investigation. Mrs May has said she accepted Mr Zahawi's explanation. Labour peer Lord Mendelsohn - whose spokesman said he attended ""part of the dinner"" as a president of a charity - said leader Jeremy Corbyn has asked him ""to step back from the front bench"". His spokesman added Lord Mendelsohn did not witness any ""appalling incidents described in reports"" and ""unreservedly condemned such behaviour"". Mr Corbyn's spokesman said: ""The reports about this appalling event were deeply shocking and there can be no excuse for anyone's attendance."" One of the organisers, David Meller, quit his non-executive role on the Department for Education board following the reports. On Thursday,the Meller Educational Trust said,externalMr Meller had also taken a leave of absence as one of it's trustees. ""We, as trustees, wish to express our sympathy to those women who have been so badly treated,"" a statement said. This video can not be played Financial Times journalist Madison Marriage: âI was groped several timesâ Madison Marriage, the reporter who worked at the event, said she and ""numerous other hostesses"" were groped at the dinner. She told BBC Newsnight: ""It's a hands up skirts, hands on bums but also hands on hips, hands on stomachs, arms going round your waist unexpectedly."" She said there were other women there ""who had absolutely no idea that was the kind of event it would be"". Before the fundraiser announced it was closing, a number of businesses said they would cut ties with the event - including WPP, the world's biggest advertising agency, and real estate investment business Frogmore. Comedian and children's author David Walliams, who is not the subject of any allegations, was the compere for the evening. He said he ""did not witness any of the kind of behaviour that allegedly occurred"", but added that he was ""absolutely appalled"" by the reports and he would be donating his fee to the Children's Trust. Channel 5 baseball show presenter Jonny Gould, who was the auctioneer at the dinner, said he had ""never witnessed any of the alleged behaviour of guests at this event nor in previous years"". He added: ""If I had, I would not have continued to work at the event."" The Dorchester said it was ""deeply concerned"" and was looking into the claims. A spokesman for the Artista agency, which recruited the hostesses, said: ""I was not aware of any claims of sexual harassment but the kind of behaviour alleged is completely unacceptable. ""I am checking with the staff and any complaints will be dealt with promptly and fairly."" Have you ever worked as a hostess at an event like this?
