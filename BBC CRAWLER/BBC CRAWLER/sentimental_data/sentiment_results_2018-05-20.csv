"This video can not be played The inquiry has opened with tributes paid to those who died The father of a baby stillborn after his parents escaped the Grenfell Tower fire has spoken of his loss on the opening day of the public inquiry. Marcio Gomes was in tears as he recalled holding his son Logan, hoping it was a bad dream. The child was stillborn in hospital on 14 June 2017, hours after his parents fled the blaze. Relatives of all 72 victims will be given the chance to commemorate loved ones during the inquiry. The inquiry will look into all the deaths - including one victim who died in January, having been in hospital since the blaze. Five others were remembered on the inquiry's first day, which began with a 72-second silence in memory of those who died. They include artist Khadija Saye and her mother Mary Mendy, Denis Murphy, Joseph Daniels and Mohamed Neda. Families are being given as long as they want to tell the inquiry about their loved ones through a mixture of words, pictures and videos. The father described his son as the inquiry was shown this image of Logan Gomes Mr Gomes said ""everything was ready"" for his baby's arrival, including a message that had been painted on the nursery wall.  The inquiry was shown an ultrasound picture of Logan, who was due on 14 August but was born two months earlier. Listen: The Grenfell Tower inquiry podcast With his wife, Andreia, sat beside him, he said it had ""felt like our hearts had broken"". ""He was going to be my superstar,"" he added. One of Denis Murphy's ""proudest days"" was his son Peter's graduation form university, the inquiry was told The family of Denis Murphy told the inquiry ""the day he died a part of all of us died"". Joined by Mr Murphy's son, brother, and ex-wife, his sister Anne Marie said the last time they had spoken was at 02.32 during the fire, when she had told him they were on their way. She described her brother as ""our hero"" and the ""linchpin to our family"". Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? What can we expect from the inquiry? What happened at the tower block? Solicitors representing the family of Mohamed Neda read tributes from his brother, son, and wife. Farhad Neda said his father was his ""best friend and the man I admire most"". Both Farhad and his mother Flora were in a coma after the fire. ""My father and I were a great team together,"" he said. Mohamed Neda would get on with anybody, his family said ""Regardless of working a night shift he would not hesitate in coming home in the morning, picking me up, and driving me to (Taekwondo) competitions."" All the medals and photographs from these competitions were lost in the blaze, Farhad added. He described the ""deep pain"" at knowing his father would not be at his wedding or ever hold his grandchildren. ""He has left everyone with very happy memories. I have missed him so very much,"" he said. Mr Neda's wife of more than 27 years, Flora, said it had been ""love at first sight"". This video can not be played The inquiry heard the last phone message of fire victim Mohamed 'Saber' Neda The pair had arrived in the UK in 1998 after fleeing persecution in Afghanistan. ""Our hopes and our dreams have been shattered,"" she said. ""There is a heavy sense of loss within our hearts that will never, ever go away. He was my husband, my best friend. I miss him so much. He will always be the love of my life."" The inquiry was played an audio recording of the last call from Mr Neda from the night of the fire. In it, he said: ""We are now leaving this world, goodbye. I hope I haven't disappointed you."" Meanwhile,a BBC Panorama investigation has discovered that the insulation that burned out of control on the Grenfell Towerhad never passed the required safety test and should never have been on the building. The programme also accused the firm of mis-selling the insulation. Panorama has been advised that the way Celotex tested and sold the insulation could amount to corporate manslaughter. Celotex said it could not comment because it was co-operating with the police investigation and public inquiry. Grenfell insulation 'never passed fire test' ByBBC reporter Emma Harrison Barrister Kieran Mitchell said ""this horrific event has obliterated so many lives"" A respectful silence descended on the conference room as the tributes to those who lost their lives in Grenfell began. The first, father Marcio Gomes, grieving for his baby son Logan, wept as he recalled the excitement his wife's pregnancy had brought to his family. The family of Denis Murphy bowed their heads on stage as a tribute was read in honour of their ""hero"" father and brother. Around them in the audience - the bereaved, friends and family - showed their support with loud applause after the tributes. Some gave a standing ovation. Others were in tears. In the short breaks between tributes, those in the room hugged and consoled each other. Above all else there is a sense that the room of survivors and bereaved need answers. Answers they hope this inquiry will give them. The family of photographer Khadija Saye and her mother Mary Mendy were joined on stage by Labour MP David Lammy. A statement from Khadija's cousin Marion, was read by the family solicitor. ""The pain is unbearable. There are no words to describe the emptiness in our hearts,"" she said. ""There will be two empty chairs at every birthday, Christmas and new year, but they will forever own a position in our hearts. We will carry their memories throughout our lives."" Marion described her aunt Mary as her ""hero"", the ""strong one, the fighter and protector"". A statement read on behalf of Khadija's father, Mohammadou Saye, talked about his daughter's passion for photography. ""Khadija said to me one day: 'Daddy, I'm in love with images.' It was this passion Khadija pursued to the end because it gave her great satisfaction and brought her some joy and some happiness."" A piece of film - part of a documentary filmed by the BBC about Khadija's work for an international art exhibition in Venice - was also shown to the inquiry. It included interviews filmed inside the Grenfell Tower flat where she lived. This video can not be played Grenfell Tower: BBC Three documentary of Khadija Saye shown at inquiry Joseph Daniels' son Sam asked for no applause after his short commemoration. ""My father moved to London in 1982 and Grenfell Tower was his only home since then,"" he said. ""The events of that night took his life and all trace of his existence from this world. He never stood a chance of getting out, it should never have happened."" Inside the 21st floor of the Grenfell Tower fire Campaigners 'won the argument' Opening the inquiry, chairman Sir Martin Moore-Bick said the fire was the ""greatest tragedy to befall this city"" since World War Two. He said the sight of the 24-storey tower ""engulfed in flames"" is ""indelibly imprinted"" on all who saw it. The retired judge said it was ""fitting"" the opening of the inquiry should be dedicated to those who died. All the victims' names will be read out at the hearings, taking place at the Millennium Gloucester Hotel in South Kensington, west London, but it is understood that not all families will give a tribute. Lead counsel to the inquiry, Richard Millett, said beginning the proceedings in this way will mean ""we will never lose sight of who our work is for and why we are doing it"".

This will take place at Holborn Bars in central London, where several procedural hearings have already taken place.

"From Charles taking Doria's hand, to ""thank you Pa"", here are some moments to remember... This video can not be played The moment Prince Charles takes Doria Ragland's hand It's been a tumultuous week for the Markles and the Raglands. Had all gone to plan, Doria Ragland's former husband, Thomas Markle, would have walked their daughter down the aisle. But he underwent heart surgery this week, putting him out of the picture, while Ms Markle's half-siblings never received an invitation. The bride's side of St George's Chapel seemed a very lonely place - Doria Ragland was the only member of the family there. Dressed in a pale green Oscar de la Renta outfit, side-set hat and delicate nose stud, she looked emotional, deep in thought and, at times, a little lost. So, at the signing of the register, she appeared relieved to take the guiding hand of Prince Charles - on what must have been a daunting and surreal occasion. This video can not be played 'Thank you Pa' The first glimpse of the groom suggested Prince Harry, in full military regalia, was in typical buoyant spirits, smiling and laughing as he waved to the crowds of well-wishers on his arrival. But the smile faded, and the emotion of the occasion was etched on his face, as he waited at the altar for his bride to arrive. As she entered on the arm of his father, Prince Charles, Harry looked close to tears. He mouthed ""thank you Pa"" to his dad as he took his seat. During the service, the prince couldn't seem to relax. In contrast, Ms Markle cut a much calmer figure, smiling often and looking into the eyes of her husband-to-be. It was only once out of the chapel and onto the streets in the carriage procession that Prince Harry seemed to breathe again - and relax. The big reveal came as a burgundy Rolls Royce Phantom pulled up at the foot of the chapel steps. Out stepped pageboys - Brian and John Mulroney - and then came the bride, trailing a five-metre fine silk veil, embroidered with the flowers of each country in the Commonwealth. The gap-toothed twins rushed around to lift the veil off the ground as Ms Markle walked alone into the chapel. To fashion expert Jo Elvin, the sculpted white boat-neck gown by British designer Clare Waight Keller for French fashion house Givenchy, was a stroke of genius. ""It compliments her style that she's known for,"" she said. David Emanuel, who designed Princess Diana's dress, said it was ""very clever"" to include the Commonwealth flowers in the veil. ""I think Diana would have approved."" Read more about the dress This video can not be played US bishop wows with his wedding address The American bishop Michael Curry, invited by Ms Markle, got the guests smiling and giggling in their pews. Bishop Curry's theme was the power of love, and he soon had his audience falling a little bit in love with him. Gesticulating in a style far removed from any other royal wedding ceremony, he addressed the audience as ""brothers and sisters"" and told them: ""There's power in love, don't underestimate it."" The bride and groom sat near the preacher, holding hands as he spoke. And when he went on for too long, carried away by the moment, he told them: ""We gotta get you all married!"" Read more about Michael Curry This video can not be played Prince Harry and Meghan share their first kiss on the steps outside St George's Chapel It's always The Moment in every royal wedding. Usually on the balcony at Buckingham Palace, this kiss had a rather more low-key, down-to-earth feel about it. The bride, looking demure, and the prince held hands as they walked out of St George's Chapel and on to the West Steps. One lip reader says Ms Markle discreetly asked her new husband: ""Do we kiss?"" To which the prince quietly replied: ""Yeah"". A jubilant crowd, ready with their mobile phones, zoomed in. One for the album.

"China's exports to the US far outweigh what it imports China and the US say they will halt imposing punitive import tariffs, putting a possible trade war ""on hold"". The deal came after talks in the US aimed at persuading China to buy $200bn (Â£148bn) of US goods and services and thereby reduce the trade imbalance. USTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin did not give figures,external, but said the US would impose tariffs worth $150bn if China did not implement the agreement. ChineseVice-Premier Liu He described the deal as a ""win-win choice"",external. He said dialogue was the way to resolve such issues and ""treat them calmly"" in the future. The US has a $335bn annual trade deficit with Beijing. Before being elected, President Donald Trump had spoken of China ""raping"" the US, and promised to label it a currency manipulator on his first day in office. This did not happen, but he ordered a review of the trade imbalance last August. It found a range of ""unfair"" practices in China, including restrictions on foreign ownership that pressured foreign companies into transferring technology, unfair terms on US companies, Chinese investments in US strategic industries and Chinese cyber-attacks. Why history drives China's tough trade stance Why WTO worried about a trade war In March this year, Mr Trump announced plans to impose tariffs on Chinese imports - mainly steel and aluminium. Beijing threatened equal retaliation, including tariffs on a number of US imports - among them aircraft, soybeans, cars, pork, wine, fruit and nuts. Two days of talks ended in Washington DC on Friday with a framework agreement. Mr Mnuchin told Fox News Sunday that China would buy more US goods ""to substantially reduce the trade deficit"". Concrete numbers had been agreed, he said, although he refused to disclose if this meant China was buying $200bn in return for the US threat to be lifted. US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross would travel to China soon, he said, to work on details, which would involve industries - not just the two governments. ""We are putting the trade war on hold. Right now we have agreed to put the tariffs on hold while we try to execute the framework"" of the agreement, Mr Mnuchin said. But he warned that failure to implement it would result in the imposition of the threatened US tariffs. The Chinese vice-premier Mr Liu said his visit to the US had been ""positive, pragmatic, constructive and productive"". He described a ""healthy development of China-US economic and trade relations"" which would result in enhanced co-operation in areas such as energy, agriculture products, healthcare, high-tech products and finance. ""Such co-operation is a win-win choice as it can promote the high-quality development of the Chinese economy, meet the people's needs, and contribute to the US effort to reduce its trade deficit,"" he added. Mr Mnuchin said the new framework agreement included structural changes to Chinese economy to enable fair competition for US companies, but this would take time, China's vice-premier said. And, perhaps because of that, he said the two countries ""should properly handle their differences through dialogue and treat them calmly in the future"".

"The Duchess of Sussex has followed tradition by having her bridal bouquet placed on the tomb of the unknown warrior at Westminster Abbey. The royal tradition, started by the Queen Mother, usually takes place the day after the wedding. Meghan paid tribute to Prince Harry's mother, Princess Diana, at their wedding by including forget-me-nots, her favourite flowers, in the bouquet. It also contained flowers handpicked by the prince at Kensington Palace. Royal Family thanks public after wedding Five moments to remember from the royal wedding Meghan Markle's Givenchy dress in detail It was designed by London-based florist Philippa Craddock, who also created the floral displays for St George's Chapel and St George's Hall using locally sourced foliage. Myrtle sprigs from stems planted by Queen Victoria at Osborne House, on the Isle of Wight, in 1845 were included, as well as sprigs taken from a plant grown from the myrtle used in the Queen's wedding bouquet in 1947. The plant became a family favourite after Queen Victoria was given myrtle by Prince Albert's grandmother during a visit to Gotha in Germany. Later that year, the couple bought Osborne House as a family retreat and they planted the sprig against the terrace walls, where it continues to bloom. It then became tradition for royal brides to carry the plant after Queen Victoria's eldest daughter, Princess Victoria, used it in her bouquet in 1858 - including the Duchess of Cambridge and Princess Diana. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on their wedding day (l) alongside Prince Harry and Meghan Markle (r) The petite bouquet carried by Meghan also contained scented sweet peas, lily of the valley, astilbe, jasmine and astrantia. Lily of the valley - the birth flower for May - is said to represent love and appreciation, the astilbe is said to symbolise patience and dedication, and astrantia means strength and courage. The flowers were then bound with a naturally dyed, raw silk ribbon. The Queen Mother began the tradition of leaving the flowers on the grave in Westminster Abbey in 1923 after her wedding to the Duke of York - who later became King George VI. The Duke of York and Lady Elizabeth Bowes Lyon on their wedding day in 1923 She is said to have left the flowers there in tribute to her brother Fergus, who was killed in 1915 during World War One. The Duchess of Cambridge also followed the tradition by having her bouquet left on the grave in 2011. The grave - which is at the west of the Nave of the Abbey - contains the body of a soldier brought back from France after World War One. He was buried on Remembrance Day, 11 November, in 1920, along with soil from the country. The idea is thought to have come from a chaplain, the Reverend David Railton, who served at the front during the war, after he saw a grave in a back garden in France with the words ""an unknown British soldier"" pencilled on. A large public ceremony took place for the burial, which included King George V laying a wreath of red roses and bay leaves on the coffin. The grave is covered by a slab of black Belgian marble and contains a long inscription, including the words: ""They buried him among the kings because he had done good toward God and toward his house.""

"The diagnosis of cancer and other diseases in the UK can be transformed by using artificial intelligence, Theresa May is to say. The NHS and technology companies should use AI as a ""new weapon"" in research, the PM will urge in a speech later. Experts say it can be used to help prevent 22,000 cancer deaths a year by 2033 while aiding the fight against heart disease, diabetes and dementia. High-skilled science jobs will also be created, Mrs May is to pledge. Speaking in Macclesfield, Mrs May will say: ""Late diagnosis of otherwise treatable illnesses is one of the biggest causes of avoidable deaths. ""And the development of smart technologies to analyse great quantities of data quickly and with a higher degree of accuracy than is possible by human beings opens up a whole new field of medical research."" Eight ways intelligent machines are already in your life Artificial intelligence 'as good as cancer doctors' The prime minister wants to see computer algorithms sifting through patients' medical records, genetic data and lifestyle habits to spot cancer. BBC health and science correspondent James Gallagher says Mrs May's plans dochime with excitement within medical scienceabout the potential of using data and AI. But our correspondent added there are many challenges ahead including creating the right infrastructure within the health service, separating hype and genuine innovation and ensuring the public's highly personal data is used responsibly. Cancer Research UK says halving the number of lung, bowel, prostate and ovarian cancers diagnosed at an advanced stage could prevent thousands of deaths a year. The prime minister will also unveil a new strategy to help older people remain healthy Sir Harpal Kumar, chief executive officer of Cancer Research, described the government's plans as pioneering but added: ""We need to ensure we have the right infrastructure, embedded in our health system, to make this possible."" Simon Gillespie, chief executive at the British Heart Foundation, said: ""Using artificial intelligence to analyse MRI scans could spot early signs of heart disease which may be missed by current techniques. ""This could lead to a quicker diagnosis with more personalised treatment that could ultimately save lives."" Mrs May will also use her speech to announce a new target to ensure that five more years of people's lives will be healthy, independent and active by 2035.

"Passengers had been urged to plan ahead and check revised timetables A rail firm cancelled dozens of trains - hours after its new timetable began. Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) rescheduled every service on its Great Northern, Thameslink and Southern franchise aspart of an overhaul billed as the biggest in the UK. It said introducing the new timetable was a ""significant logistical challenge"" and apologised for ""any inconvenience caused"" to passengers. It was unable to confirm how many trains had been cancelled on Sunday. A GTR spokesman added: ""We are introducing the biggest change to rail timetables in a generation and, as we have been informing passengers, we expect some disruption to services in the initial stages. ""This is a significant logistical challenge as we make rolling incremental changes across more than 3,000 daily services."" He added the timetable changes would mean a 13% increase in services across the GTR network. The RMT and Aslef unions said they understood the disruption was because there were not enough fully-trained drivers. The changes affect Great Northern, Southern and Thameslink trains An RMT spokesman said: ""The union is still talking to members about the impact on the new timetable and plans to release further information on Monday."" The Thameslink, Southern and Great Northern rail franchise includes services to Bedford, Luton, Peterborough, King's Lynn, Cambridge, London King's Cross, London Moorgate, Wimbledon and Brighton. No entire routes were cancelled on Sunday but ""occasional trains"" were not running, said a spokesman. Frustrated passengers tweeted to complain about disruption on Great Northern services, with one asking ""Any clue as to the reason? No drivers by any chance? Or explain the operational incident please."" The company replied: ""Unfortunately we are not privy to this information"". Another stranded passenger wrote: ""You've cancelled 5 (FIVE!!!) trains in a ROW between London and Stevenage, what an absolute joke"" while another asked: ""Surely you have had more than a year to plan your new timetable?""

From Sunday,every schedule for Thameslink, Southern, Gatwick Express and Great Northern trains has been changed, in an attempt to improve rail efficiency in the South East. It will mean 400 extra trains a day and new direct services from 80 stations into central London. But passengers in a number of smaller locations complain they will be served with fewer or slower services. Steve Chambers, from the Campaign For Better Transport, said he was concerned about the disruption seen on Sunday. ""The changes have been brought in on a day when there are usually less passengers and less trains and still there have been problems,"" he said. ""It doesn't bode well for tomorrow. But the biggest issue altogether will be people turning up to get their usual train and finding it no longer exists. ""The way customers have been informed just has not been good enough."" The RMT also claims passengers with reduced mobility may be left behind if a train is at risk of delay. GTR said it placed high priority on making its services accessible to all.

"Ms Valdez's suspected abductor Mark Hennessy was shot in Cherrywood in south Dublin by GardaÃ­ (Irish police) The woman abducted near her home in County Wicklow died by strangulation, Irish police have confirmed. A post mortem examination took place on Tuesday to establish how 24-year-old Jastine Valdez died. GardaÃ­ (Irish police) had been searching for Ms Valdez after witnesses saw the student being bundled into a car near Enniskerry on Saturday. Her body was found in the Puck's Castle area of County Dublin on Monday. According to Irish national broadcaster RTE,external, detectives believe she was killed within 45 minutes of being abducted. A blood-stained note found in the car driven by her suspected killer Mark Hennessy is to be forensically analysed. Mr Hennessy, 40, was shot dead by police in Cherrywood in south Dublin on Sunday night. Police are investigating Mr Hennessy's background. The Wicklow father of two had a previous conviction for assault a number of years ago, but he was also facing a drink-driving charge after he had been arrested last year, RTE reports. Officers thanked the public for their help with the investigation and appealed for privacy for the Valdez family. It was reported that Ms Valdez's purse was found by GardaÃ­ in the Rathmichael area of County Dublin on Monday morning. Jastine Valdez was last seen alive on Saturday afternoon Search teams were in Rathmichael and also searched an area known as the 'Scalp', while a walk on Killiney Hill was cordoned off. The Garda helicopter conducted an aerial search of the area while members of the Irish Defence Forces and Civil Defence were called in to help. It is understood Mr Hennessy was armed with a knife when he was shot. A Garda statement said officers had ""interacted with the driver"" of a black Nissan Qashqai in Cherrywood at about 20:00 local time on Sunday. It added that an ""official Garda firearm was discharged"" during the incident. The shooting has since been referred to the Republic of Ireland's police watchdog for an independent investigation. Officers searching for Ms Valdez had appealed for information about the suspected abduction of a woman on the R760 road out of Enniskerry, around the same time she disappeared. Mr Hennessy was a father of two from County Wicklow A woman walking along the road was reportedly forced into a black Nissan Qashqai, registration 171 D 20419, at about 18:15 local time on Saturday. A phone belonging to Ms Valdez was later found near the Powerscourt Estate in Enniskerry and the area was cordoned off for investigation. Police traced a vehicle to the man who was later shot An incident room has been established at Bray Garda Station. Sunday Times journalist John Mooney said that after the abduction reports, police viewed CCTV footage and traced a vehicle to Mr Hennessy. They visited his home in Bray, County Wicklow, but his partner said he was not there. Mr Mooney said there was no known link between Mr Hennessy and Ms Valdez. ""The words abduction and ransom have been mentioned to me, but some of the more established detectives working on this case are stating that maybe there's some connection that hasn't been established just yet,"" he said. ""But at the moment there is no clear link between the two.""

"This video can not be played Eruptions could block escape routes for residents on south-eastern corner of Big Island The first serious injury has been reported as Hawaii continues to grapple with weeks of volcanic eruptions and lava flow. The injured man was sitting on a balcony at his home when ""lava spatter"" - projectile molten rock - landed on him. ""It hit him on the shin and shattered everything there down on his leg,"" a spokeswoman for the county mayor said. Lava spatters can weigh ""as much as a refrigerator"", she told Reuters. The Kilauea volcano on Hawaii's Big Island erupted at the beginning of May, and the situation for residents has steadily been worsening. On Saturday, a key coastal road used as the main escape route for residents was in danger of being cut off, which could hamper evacuations. Volcano's dramatic images explained Hawaii volcano spews 'ballistic blocks' Reality Check: What stops eruptions of lava? The possibility of the lava flows reaching the ocean, meanwhile, threatens to release toxic gases in a plume called a ""laze"". When molten lava hits sea water, the chemical reaction can create ""hazy and noxious conditions"" laced with hydrochloric acid and tiny particles of glass, the US Geological Survey (USGS) says. ""Even the wispy edges of it can cause skin and eye irritation and breathing difficulties,"" USGS warned. Some of the lava flows have increased over the weekend. The Hawaiian Volcano Observatory said that the rate of eruptions increased in the area known as the lower east rift zone, where four fissures have merged together. The result is ""a continuous line of spatter and fountaining"". Two different lava flows from the combined fissures have now merged less than a mile from the coast. Geologists are warning that the behaviour of the lava flows remains unpredictable, and are urging residents to obey all warnings from Hawaii's civil defence. This fast-moving flow in the Pahoe area consumed a home, seen here burning in the top left At the summit, a large explosion happened at around midnight on Friday night into Saturday, sending a plume of volcanic gas some 10,000 ft (two miles, or 3km) into the air. Thousands of people have already left their homes in some areas of the island. Bush fires have also broken out in several areas. ""It is a very dynamic situation,"" geologist Carolyn Parcheta from the observatory told a news conference, while warning of the risk to one of the main residential areas. Lava ""flooded around the east side of Lanipuna Gardens, and to me that is a very scary scenario,"" she said. ""That's what concerns me most - is that people might be trapped by something like that."" Despite safety concerns in some residential areas - and worries that volcanic ash could interfere with air travel - Hawaii's business community has stressed that many tourist activities remain open, as do the island's airports.

"Paul Austin found the device about 500 yards from his front door A live German sea mine from World War Two washed up on the Sussex coast has been towed out to sea and blown up. The large metal device measuring about 6ft (1.8m) and thought to weigh about 1,000kg was found on Saturday. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) said the mine was ""safely detonated"" at about 17:10 BST. Earlier, residents were alerted as a precaution and vessels were told to steer clear of the mine off Elmer Beach, near Bognor Regis. A mile-wide maritime and air exclusion zone was in force, with coastguards broadcasting to vessels in the area. Operations have been taking place through the night Sussex Police said bomb disposal teams were called in after the device was found in the water by someone living nearby. Explosives teams inspected the device and work took place to make it safe while the tides allowed access, officers said. Paul Austin, who found the device and alerted emergency services, said when he looked at it closely, it was ""quite clearly a weapon"". He had been walking on the beach with a friend when he saw the object and noticed it had a propeller, or a fin, and a cone nose. ""At first it looked like a big oil drum. I didn't think it was a bomb,"" he said. ""We were almost standing on it, but then we stepped away. ""I said 'let's throw stones at it' as a joke. But then I thought - actually, that's a torpedo or a bomb."" Police are working with bomb disposal experts He said he had since talked to emergency teams and learned it was one of the biggest bombs the Nazis ever produced. The device was about 500 yards from his front door, he added. Mr Austin said he was struck by how the bomb would have been used in the war, adding: ""If that went up, and it's full of TNT, it would have taken a lot of people with it."" Coastguards said the device could be detonated at sea No homes had to be evacuated. Ch Supt Jane Derrick said the force had followed advice from military ordnance teams about safe areas. Other members of the public were earlier asked to avoid the Elmer Beach area, whether for using the beach, swimming or sailing.

"President Trump often starts his attacks - and announces political initiatives - on Twitter The US Department of Justice says it is expanding an internal inquiry after President Donald Trump suggested the FBI ""infiltrated"" his 2016 campaign. The department said on Monday it will look for any ""political motivation"" in its own inquiry into alleged Russian election meddling in the US. Mr Trump later backed the move after meeting top justice and FBI officials at the White House. He is angry that a confidential source was used during the investigation. And he has saidhe wants to know whether a member of the Obama team ordered such a move,external. But Democrats and members of the intelligence community have warned against unmasking a source because they say this puts lives at risk. Department of Justice spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores said on Monday the agency's inspector general would ""expand the ongoing review"" of its applications to snoop on former Trump election campaign adviser Carter Page. The inspector general is being asked to determine ""whether there was any impropriety or political motivation"" on the part of US agents who conducted counter-intelligence operations of ""persons suspected of involvement with the Russian agents who interfered in the 2016 presidential election"". The announcement comes after US media reports suggesting the FBI had an informant meeting campaign aides. The deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein said action would be taken if any infiltration was found. ""If anyone did infiltrate or surveil participants in a presidential campaign for inappropriate purposes, we need to know about it and take appropriate action,"" Mr Rosenstein said in a statement. The president met FBI Director Christopher Wray and Mr Rosenstein at the White House on Monday afternoon. Director of National Intelligence Dan Coates was also present. After that meeting, the White House said in a statement the Department of Justice (DoJ) had asked its inspector general to expand the investigation. And White House Chief of Staff Kelly will set up a meeting with the FBI, DoJ, the Department of National Intelligence and congressional leaders to review ""highly classified and other information they have requested"". Analysis: Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America correspondent After meeting the president, the DoJ and FBI agreed toâ¦ exactly what they had already said they would do the previous night. The inspector general will expand his probe into the handling of investigations during 2016 election season to include any ""irregularities"" involving FBI or Justice Department ""tactics"" - language vague enough to be essentially meaningless. The ongoing internal review was already broadly defined, and the White House statement does not detail any of the specific allegations of misdeeds, such as ""implanted"" spies and FBI ""infiltration"", that populated the presidential Twitter feed over the past few days. Mr Trump's Sunday outburst on Twitter threatened to breach the longstanding firewall between the White House and the Department of Justice's investigatory operations. That particular bomb appears to have been defused - at least for now. Mr Trump's weekend outburst will probably be viewed by government officials as only the latest example of presidential frustration-venting. Congressional representatives, with the assistance of top intelligence agency officials, will gain access to sensitive details of the FBI's investigation into Russian election meddling. In the past, secrets in the hands of Congress haven't stayed that way for long. This time may be no different. Mr Trump first made the accusation that the FBI had sent a spy into his campaign team on Friday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""It took place very early on, and long before the phony Russia Hoax became a 'hot' Fake News story,"" Mr Trump tweeted, adding: ""If true - all time biggest political scandal!"" The New York Times followed with an article that suggested there was, indeed, an FBI informant,external-  whose identity it did not reveal - who had been sent to speak to campaign aides but only after the FBI had received reports of ""suspicious contacts linked to Russia"". The informant - an American academic working in the UK - had made contact with George Papadopoulos and Carter Page. The Washington Post reported a similar account. Law enforcement officials have refused to provide evidence to congressional leaders over the issue. They have argued that doing so would put the alleged informant's life - or that of his contacts - in danger. Mr Trump could order the US Department of Justice - which has oversight over the FBI - to release the documents. Some Democrats are deeply unhappy. Senator Mark Warner, who is the ranking member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said: ""Publicly outing a source risks not only their life, but the lives of every American, because when sources are burned it makes it that much harder for every part of the intelligence community to gather intelligence on those who wish to do us harm."" Special Counsel Robert Mueller is looking into Russia's efforts to interfere in the 2016 US election, whether there was any collusion between the Kremlin and the Trump team and whether the president tried unlawfully to obstruct the inquiry. All you need to know about Trump Russia story Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? According to the Washington Post, the informant has been aiding the Russia investigation since before Mr Mueller's appointment a year ago. The FBI opened the inquiry in the middle of the election campaign in July 2016. But it remains unclear how the informant first came by the information that led to his meetings with Mr Papadopoulos and Mr Page - and his wider role as an FBI informant. Robert Mueller has admirers on all sides of US politics As for Mr Mueller, the former FBI head has so far charged 19 people. Mr Papadopoulos has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about the timing of meetings with alleged go-betweens for Russia. But Mr Trump and his supporters have multiplied their attacks on the special counsel's work. Without providing any evidence on Sunday, Mr Trump demanded a stop to the inquiry - that he said was nearing $20m in costs and was composed of 13 ""angry and heavily conflicted Democrats"". Mr Mueller is a Republican. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

About 30 firefighters using backpacks tackled the flames for several hours after the fire was reported at about 13:40 on Sunday. Crews left the scene at about 23:30, but one appliance returned at about 11:00. One casualty was taken into the care of paramedics with a suspected leg injury. Firefighters are currently beating out smouldering patches on the extinct volcano. Fire chiefs in Scotland have warned of an increased risk of wildfires, following a series of blazes across the country. On Saturday crews tackled a large heather fire in Caithness. Park Rangers were trying to stop people climbing Arthur's Seat Nine fire engines were sent to the blaze at Mobster Croft in the Spittal area after the alarm was raised shortly before midday. Firefighters spent more than six hours tackling the wildfire. Crew from Balintore fire station were among firefighters called to tackle a wildfire near Mey in Caithness on Friday. And in Argyll on Saturday the A85 near Dalmally was closed by a wildfire for several hours. The fire was on both sides of the road at Glenlochy. The previous day crews had been called to a wildfire near Mey village in Caithness. Fire chiefs warned that discarded cigarettes and unattended barbecues or campfires can start fires which burn for days and devastate vast areas of land Bruce Farquharson, an area manager with the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, urged the public to play their part in preventing further fires. ""Right now, many firefighters across Scotland are actively tackling wildfires, working to protect our communities and their efforts have to be commended,"" he said. ""However, many of these fires are preventable, and we again urge people to read our safety advice, and enjoy the weather responsibly."" The Balintore fire crew were also called out to help at the wildfire in Caithness on Saturday. Mr Farquharson, who is also the chairman of the Scottish Wildfire Forum, urged people to follow theScottish Outdoor Access Code,external. He added: ""Wild and grass fires can start by the careless disposal of cigarettes and barbecues or campfires left unattended. ""They then have the potential to burn for days and devastate vast areas of land, wildlife and threaten the welfare of nearby communities. ""Many rural and remote communities, such as those in the Highland area, are hugely impacted by wildfires, which can cause significant environmental and economic damage. ""Livestock, farmland, wildlife, protected woodland and sites of special scientific interest can all be devastated by these fires - as can the lives of people living and working in rural communities. ""Just one heat source like a campfire ember can cause it to ignite and if the wind changes direction even the smallest fire can spread uncontrollably and devastate entire hillsides."" Crews from across Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross have been mobilised to tackle wildfires over the last two days Scottish Natural Heritage said there was a danger of fires in the north east, south east and central Scotland, especially between 16 and 24 May. Its recreation and tourism manager, Mark Wrightham, said: ""In this weather, we advise people to be careful when lighting fires, or consider using a camping stove instead. Be particularly cautious when disposing of cigarettes - even a cigarette butt can easily start a wildfire. ""One of the biggest risks is disposable barbecues. These should be taken away and disposed of safely in a bin. You may think the barbecue's no longer a risk, but the lingering heat could cause vegetation to smoulder and catch fire. ""A few simple tips can make all the difference in making sure as many people as possible can enjoy our countryside safely.""

"Fernando de Noronha has one of the world's best beaches A remote Brazilian island with a ban on childbirth is nonetheless celebrating the first baby born there in 12 years. Fernando de Noronha island, 370km (230 miles) from the city of Natal, has about 3,000 residents but no maternity wards. Expectant mothers are requested to travel to the mainland. A woman who does not want to be named had a baby girl on Saturday on the island - she says she was unaware she was pregnant and is ""dumbstruck"". Brazilian island overrun by invasion of blind toads The woman is believed to be aged 22. ""On Friday night I had pains and when I went to the bathroom I saw something coming down between my legs,"" she was quoted as saying by O Globo website. ""That's when the child's father came and picked it up. It was a baby, a girl. I was dumbstruck."" The baby was later taken to the local hospital. In a statement, the local administration confirmed the birth. ""The mother, who does not wish to be identified, went into labour at her home,"" the statement says, according to O Globo. ""The family says they were not aware of the pregnancy."" To celebrate the rare birth, local residents are now helping the family, with some donating clothes for the baby girl, reports say. Fernando de Noronha boasts some of the world's best beaches and is famous for its wildlife reserve in Brazil's national maritime park. Sea turtles, dolphins, whales and rare birds are frequently observed there. Because of the reserve's vulnerability, strict population controls are in place on the island.

"Ed Sheeran says he has not given permission for his song Small Bump to be used by anti-abortion campaigners. The singer told his Instagram followers it was ""important"" that he let them know ""it does not reflect what the song is about"". He said he's been told that the song, released in 2012, has been used to promote an anti-abortion campaign. It comes just days before a referendum on whether tochange Ireland's strict abortion lawstakes place on 25 May. This video can not be played Why Ireland is having a referendum on abortion Small Bump, which comes from his debut album + (Plus), includes the lyrics: ""You were just a small bump unborn, just four months then torn from life. ""Maybe you were needed up there, but we're still unaware as why."" Writing on Instagram on Friday, Ed said: ""I've been informed that my song Small Bump is being used to promote the pro-life campaign, and I feel it's important to let you know I have not given approval for this use, and it does not reflect what the song is about."" Voters in Ireland are to decide on whether to change the country's constitution - which only allows for abortions if the life of the mother is in danger. If passed, the law would allow for abortions to take place up to 12 weeks of pregnancy without restriction. At the moment, a woman convicted of having an illegal abortion faces up to 14 years in jail. But they are allowed to travel abroad for terminations.

"This video can not be played Doctor Jose Luis Castellano described the crash site as ""very painful"" to behold The Mexican charter company whose plane crashed in Cuba on Friday, killing 110 people on board, had received prior safety complaints, two-ex pilots say. One of the pilots described how a plane rented from Damojh airlines had dropped off radar completely some eight years ago. Another alleged poor maintenance. Mexican authorities say they will carry out a safety audit of the company. Three women survived the crash near Havana airport - Cuba's deadliest air disaster in more than 30 years. Separately, it was revealed that 10 Protestant evangelical priests and their wives were among the crash victims. Miraculous plane crash survivors Cuba country profile Major air disasters timeline Cuban authorities have launched an investigation into the crash, as rescuers continue to comb through the wreckage site some 20km (12 miles) south of the Cuban capital. One of two ""black boxes"" that hold key flight data and information about what happened to the plane has been recovered and is said to be in good condition. Allegations of previous safety complaints have emerged against the Mexican-based Damojh company, which leased both the Boeing 737 and its crew to Cuba's flagship state Cubana airline. The head of Guyana's civil aviation body, Cpt Egbert Field, told the Associated Press news agency the same plane - which was nearly 40 years old - had been barred from using Guyanese airspace last year after authorities found its crew were overloading luggage on flights in Cuba. In one instance, the news agency reports,Guyanese authorities had discovered suitcases stored in the plane's toilets.,external The plane crashed in a field near Havana international airport Meanwhile, a retired pilot for Cubana wrote on Facebook that another plane rented by his airline from the same company had briefly dropped off radar for unspecified reasons while over the central Cuban city of Santa Clara in 2010 or 2011. The captain and co-pilot of that flight were later suspended for ""problems and serious lack of technical knowledge,"" said Ovidio Martinez Lopez, who worked for Cubana for more than 40 years. He said ""many flight attendants, flight attendants and flight safety personnel"" had refused to fly on certain Cubana planes over the years. Another pilot who used to work for Damojh told Mexican newspaper Milenio he had complained about a lack of adequate maintenance of planes. ""I experienced several incidents at this company, like engine failure or the electrical system went when we took off from Mexico on one occasion"", Marco Aurelio Hernandez was quoted as saying. The company has yet to comment on the allegations. Cuba's transport minister said on Saturday that five children were among the victims. Adel Yzquierdo also updated the official death toll to 110, andlisted the nationalities of the victims:,external 99 Cubans Six Mexican crew members One Mexican tourist An Argentine couple Two passengers from the Western Sahara (a disputed territory annexed by Morocco after Spain withdrew in 1975) Also among the dead were 10 evangelical priests and their spouses who had been meeting in Havana for several days and were returning to their homes in Holguin province, where the flight was destined to land. ""On that plane were 10 couples of pastors. Twenty people. All of the Nazarene Church in the eastern region,"" confirmed Maite Quesada, a member of the Cuban Council of Churches. Victims' relatives have been helping authorities in Havana to identify their loved ones The Argentine couple have been named by their government as Dora Beatriz Cifuentes and Oscar Hugo Almaras, both in their 60s. Several victims' relatives have travelled to Havana to help identify the deceased. Meanwhile, the three survivors remain in critical condition with serious burns.

"China's exports to the US far outweigh what it imports China and the US say they will halt imposing punitive import tariffs, putting a possible trade war ""on hold"". The deal came after talks in the US aimed at persuading China to buy $200bn (Â£148bn) of US goods and services and thereby reduce the trade imbalance. USTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin did not give figures,external, but said the US would impose tariffs worth $150bn if China did not implement the agreement. ChineseVice-Premier Liu He described the deal as a ""win-win choice"",external. He said dialogue was the way to resolve such issues and ""treat them calmly"" in the future. The US has a $335bn annual trade deficit with Beijing. Before being elected, President Donald Trump had spoken of China ""raping"" the US, and promised to label it a currency manipulator on his first day in office. This did not happen, but he ordered a review of the trade imbalance last August. It found a range of ""unfair"" practices in China, including restrictions on foreign ownership that pressured foreign companies into transferring technology, unfair terms on US companies, Chinese investments in US strategic industries and Chinese cyber-attacks. Why history drives China's tough trade stance Why WTO worried about a trade war In March this year, Mr Trump announced plans to impose tariffs on Chinese imports - mainly steel and aluminium. Beijing threatened equal retaliation, including tariffs on a number of US imports - among them aircraft, soybeans, cars, pork, wine, fruit and nuts. Two days of talks ended in Washington DC on Friday with a framework agreement. Mr Mnuchin told Fox News Sunday that China would buy more US goods ""to substantially reduce the trade deficit"". Concrete numbers had been agreed, he said, although he refused to disclose if this meant China was buying $200bn in return for the US threat to be lifted. US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross would travel to China soon, he said, to work on details, which would involve industries - not just the two governments. ""We are putting the trade war on hold. Right now we have agreed to put the tariffs on hold while we try to execute the framework"" of the agreement, Mr Mnuchin said. But he warned that failure to implement it would result in the imposition of the threatened US tariffs. The Chinese vice-premier Mr Liu said his visit to the US had been ""positive, pragmatic, constructive and productive"". He described a ""healthy development of China-US economic and trade relations"" which would result in enhanced co-operation in areas such as energy, agriculture products, healthcare, high-tech products and finance. ""Such co-operation is a win-win choice as it can promote the high-quality development of the Chinese economy, meet the people's needs, and contribute to the US effort to reduce its trade deficit,"" he added. Mr Mnuchin said the new framework agreement included structural changes to Chinese economy to enable fair competition for US companies, but this would take time, China's vice-premier said. And, perhaps because of that, he said the two countries ""should properly handle their differences through dialogue and treat them calmly in the future"".

"This video can not be played Tech companies ignored invite to government meeting about online behaviour, says Matt Hancock The culture secretary has agreed he does not have enough power to police social media firms after admitting only four of 14 invited to talks showed up. Matt Hancock told the BBC it had given him ""a big impetus"" to introduce new laws to tackle what he has called the internet's ""Wild West"" culture. He admitted self-policing had not worked and legislation was needed. But Labour's Tom Watson said the government had ""squandered"" chances to ""get tough on the tech giants"". Mr Hancock told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show, presented by Emma Barnett, that the government ""just don't know"" how many children of the millions using using social media were not old enough for an account and he was ""very worried"" about age verification. Four of the biggest hazards of social media Facebook's Zuckerberg faces formal summons from MPs Germany starts enforcing hate speech law He said that as part of the Data Protection Bill currently going through Parliament, firms could be fined up to 4% of their global turnover - which could run to more than Â£1bn for the biggest firms. Asked what the threshold would be for firms to be hit with fines, in terms of underage children on certain platforms, he said: ""I'm not going to give a figure because we are going to consult on it."" He told the programme he hopes ""we get to a position"" where all users of social media have to get their age verified. Codes of conduct would be examined he said as existing ""terms of reference"" were often not enforced properly. Asked how many of the 14 firms invited to attend government talks had showed up, he replied: ""Four."" By BBC political correspondent Jonathan Blake Governments love to talk tough, but sooner or later they have to back it up with action. The culture secretary has admitted that calling on technology companies to ""step up"" and ""do more"" has only got ministers so far. But efforts to regulate the internet have had limited success. A plan to introduce age verification for all porn sites was due to come into force in April, but has been delayed with no details given about how it might work. An ""opt in"" system where internet service providers ask people if they want to access adult content has seen sex education and suicide prevention advice inadvertently blocked. A new law in Germany forcing social networks to remove hate speech within 24 hours is being revised after complaints that too much content was being blocked. Two government departments are working on the new laws aimed at holding technology companies to account. They have a difficult, if not impossible, task. He said: ""One of the problems we have got is that we engage with Facebook, Google and Twitter and they get all of the press, they get all of the complaints in the public debate but there's now actually a far greater number of social media platforms like musical.ly. ""They didn't show up and the companies, they have now got over a million on their site."" He said that this, and the difficulties getting Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg to answer MPs' questions showed Britain did not have the power needed: ""That's one of the reasons we are legislating. ""The fact that only four companies turned up when I invited the 14 biggest in gave me a big impetus to drive this proposal to legislate through."" Pushed for details of how quickly social media firms would have to remove terrorist content to avoid a fine, he said: ""We should be very ambitious,"" but said a set timescale could mean companies ""work up to that timescale"", while he would prefer them to do so ""as quickly as possible"". According to a consultation carried out last year, following the Internet Safety Green Paper, four out of 10 people had experienced abuse online and 60% had seen inappropriate content. Digital Minister Margot James told Sky's Ridge on Sunday she had received abuse and reported it to the police. She added: ""It's not just of parliamentarians, it's any woman in public life, and some of our famous broadcasters have had the most terrible abuse online which is completely unacceptable - if it's not illegal it should be and I think some of it is."" Two government departments are working on a White Paper expected to be brought forward later this year. Asked about the same issue on ITV's Peston on Sunday, Mr Hancock said the government would be legislating ""in the next couple of years"" because ""we want to get the details right"". Barnardo's chief executive officer Javed Khan urged the government to consider legislation ""that ends the era of technology self-regulation and puts children's safety at the heart of the online world"". But shadow culture secretary Tom Watson said: ""It's embarrassing that the social media companies don't even take Matt Hancock seriously enough to show up to meet him. ""The data protection bill was the opportunity to get tough on the tech giants and the government has squandered that. ""They voted down Labour's proposal for a digital bill of rights that would have given adults and children stronger statutory protections online."" There have been a number of efforts by politicians to curb intimidation and abuse on social media. In February Theresa May announced a crackdown on the intimidation of political candidates and highlighted the ""coarsening and toxifying of our public debate"" on social media. Mr Hancock's predecessor, Karen Bradley, said that Facebook and Twitter could be asked to help fund campaigns against abuse while the European Commission flagged up delays by social networks in preventing and removing hate speech. Former Home Secretary Amber Rudd last year accused technology experts of ""sneering"" at politicians who tried to regulate their industry.

From Sunday,every schedule for Thameslink, Southern, Gatwick Express and Great Northern trains has been changed, in an attempt to improve rail efficiency in the South East. It will mean 400 extra trains a day and new direct services from 80 stations into central London. But passengers in a number of smaller locations complain they will be served with fewer or slower services. Steve Chambers, from the Campaign For Better Transport, said he was concerned about the disruption seen on Sunday. ""The changes have been brought in on a day when there are usually less passengers and less trains and still there have been problems,"" he said. ""It doesn't bode well for tomorrow. But the biggest issue altogether will be people turning up to get their usual train and finding it no longer exists. ""The way customers have been informed just has not been good enough."" The RMT also claims passengers with reduced mobility may be left behind if a train is at risk of delay. GTR said it placed high priority on making its services accessible to all.

From Sunday,every schedule for Thameslink, Southern, Gatwick Express and Great Northern trains has been changed, in an attempt to improve rail efficiency in the South East. It will mean 400 extra trains a day and new direct services from 80 stations into central London. But passengers in a number of smaller locations complain they will be served with fewer or slower services. Steve Chambers, from the Campaign For Better Transport, said he was concerned about the disruption seen on Sunday. ""The changes have been brought in on a day when there are usually less passengers and less trains and still there have been problems,"" he said. ""It doesn't bode well for tomorrow. But the biggest issue altogether will be people turning up to get their usual train and finding it no longer exists. ""The way customers have been informed just has not been good enough."" The RMT also claims passengers with reduced mobility may be left behind if a train is at risk of delay. GTR said it placed high priority on making its services accessible to all.

"Paul Austin found the device about 500 yards from his front door A live German sea mine from World War Two washed up on the Sussex coast has been towed out to sea and blown up. The large metal device measuring about 6ft (1.8m) and thought to weigh about 1,000kg was found on Saturday. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) said the mine was ""safely detonated"" at about 17:10 BST. Earlier, residents were alerted as a precaution and vessels were told to steer clear of the mine off Elmer Beach, near Bognor Regis. A mile-wide maritime and air exclusion zone was in force, with coastguards broadcasting to vessels in the area. Operations have been taking place through the night Sussex Police said bomb disposal teams were called in after the device was found in the water by someone living nearby. Explosives teams inspected the device and work took place to make it safe while the tides allowed access, officers said. Paul Austin, who found the device and alerted emergency services, said when he looked at it closely, it was ""quite clearly a weapon"". He had been walking on the beach with a friend when he saw the object and noticed it had a propeller, or a fin, and a cone nose. ""At first it looked like a big oil drum. I didn't think it was a bomb,"" he said. ""We were almost standing on it, but then we stepped away. ""I said 'let's throw stones at it' as a joke. But then I thought - actually, that's a torpedo or a bomb."" Police are working with bomb disposal experts He said he had since talked to emergency teams and learned it was one of the biggest bombs the Nazis ever produced. The device was about 500 yards from his front door, he added. Mr Austin said he was struck by how the bomb would have been used in the war, adding: ""If that went up, and it's full of TNT, it would have taken a lot of people with it."" Coastguards said the device could be detonated at sea No homes had to be evacuated. Ch Supt Jane Derrick said the force had followed advice from military ordnance teams about safe areas.

"This video can not be played Doctor Jose Luis Castellano described the crash site as ""very painful"" to behold The Mexican charter company whose plane crashed in Cuba on Friday, killing 110 people on board, had received prior safety complaints, two-ex pilots say. One of the pilots described how a plane rented from Damojh airlines had dropped off radar completely some eight years ago. Another alleged poor maintenance. Mexican authorities say they will carry out a safety audit of the company. Three women survived the crash near Havana airport - Cuba's deadliest air disaster in more than 30 years. Separately, it was revealed that 10 Protestant evangelical priests and their wives were among the crash victims. Miraculous plane crash survivors Cuba country profile Major air disasters timeline Cuban authorities have launched an investigation into the crash, as rescuers continue to comb through the wreckage site some 20km (12 miles) south of the Cuban capital. One of two ""black boxes"" that hold key flight data and information about what happened to the plane has been recovered and is said to be in good condition. Allegations of previous safety complaints have emerged against the Mexican-based Damojh company, which leased both the Boeing 737 and its crew to Cuba's flagship state Cubana airline. The head of Guyana's civil aviation body, Cpt Egbert Field, told the Associated Press news agency the same plane - which was nearly 40 years old - had been barred from using Guyanese airspace last year after authorities found its crew were overloading luggage on flights in Cuba. In one instance, the news agency reports,Guyanese authorities had discovered suitcases stored in the plane's toilets.,external The plane crashed in a field near Havana international airport Meanwhile, a retired pilot for Cubana wrote on Facebook that another plane rented by his airline from the same company had briefly dropped off radar for unspecified reasons while over the central Cuban city of Santa Clara in 2010 or 2011. The captain and co-pilot of that flight were later suspended for ""problems and serious lack of technical knowledge,"" said Ovidio Martinez Lopez, who worked for Cubana for more than 40 years. He said ""many flight attendants, flight attendants and flight safety personnel"" had refused to fly on certain Cubana planes over the years. Another pilot who used to work for Damojh told Mexican newspaper Milenio he had complained about a lack of adequate maintenance of planes. ""I experienced several incidents at this company, like engine failure or the electrical system went when we took off from Mexico on one occasion"", Marco Aurelio Hernandez was quoted as saying. The company has yet to comment on the allegations. Cuba's transport minister said on Saturday that five children were among the victims. Adel Yzquierdo also updated the official death toll to 110, andlisted the nationalities of the victims:,external 99 Cubans Six Mexican crew members One Mexican tourist An Argentine couple Two passengers from the Western Sahara (a disputed territory annexed by Morocco after Spain withdrew in 1975) Also among the dead were 10 evangelical priests and their spouses who had been meeting in Havana for several days and were returning to their homes in Holguin province, where the flight was destined to land. ""On that plane were 10 couples of pastors. Twenty people. All of the Nazarene Church in the eastern region,"" confirmed Maite Quesada, a member of the Cuban Council of Churches. Victims' relatives have been helping authorities in Havana to identify their loved ones The Argentine couple have been named by their government as Dora Beatriz Cifuentes and Oscar Hugo Almaras, both in their 60s. Several victims' relatives have travelled to Havana to help identify the deceased. Meanwhile, the three survivors remain in critical condition with serious burns.

"Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich has faced delays in renewing his UK visa, the BBC understands. The Russian billionaire did not attend Saturday's FA Cup final at Wembley when the Blues beat Manchester United 1-0. A source close to the 51-year-old suggested he was in the process of renewing his visa, and said it was taking a little longer than usual. Asked about the visa, Security Minister Ben Wallace said: ""We do not routinely comment on individual cases."" Mr Abramovich's office said it does not discuss personal matters with the media. Reality Check: What's an investor visa? Reports suggest his investor visa expired three weeks ago. The delay comes amid increased diplomatic tensions between London and Moscow after the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal in Salisbury. BBC home affairs correspondent, Daniel Sandford said Mr Abramovich appears to be able to run his businesses in Russia without significant interference from the Kremlin, suggesting that he is reasonably close to President Vladimir Putin. But he said it was not clear if the delay in renewing his visa is in any way linked to the deterioration in relations between the two countries. This video can not be played The Chelsea football club owner's visa expired three weeks ago Mr Abramovich, who made his fortune in oil and gas in the 1990s, became owner of the companies that control Chelsea in 2003. According to the Sunday Times Rich List, he is Britain's 13th-richest man, with a net worth of Â£9.3bn. He owns a mansion on Kensington Palace Gardens, the most expensive street in London. Mr Abramovich is also the former governor of the remote Chukotka region in Russia's Far East. He has been a regular visitor to the UK since buying Chelsea, attending many of the home matches, and has been to Wembley for previous cup finals. His private Boeing 767 left the UK on 1 April. It has since travelled to Moscow, New York, Monaco and Switzerland but does not seem to have returned to Britain. Mr Abramovich (right) has often been spotted at Chelsea's Stamford Bridge ground The 51-year-old is one of Russia's richest billionaires He reportedly sold dolls before making his fortune in oil in the 1990s after the collapse of the former Soviet Union Mr Abramovich was a one-time business partner of the late tycoon Boris Berezovky, an associate of former Russian President Boris Yeltsin Critics say the two businessmen used their Kremlin ""family"" ties to acquire key state companies for below market value Abramovich served as governor of Russia's Chukotka region He is believed to be close to current Russian President Vladimir Putin Death toll rises amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

"Twenty-two people were killed in the Manchester Arena attack on 22 May last year The public must do more to tackle terrorism by standing up to hate, a group of terror attack survivors and relatives has said. In an open letter released ahead of the Manchester bombing anniversary on Tuesday, they set out a five-point plan to help stop future plots. Among the 41 signatories is the widow of murdered Fusilier Lee Rigby. Others are survivors and relatives of those killed in attacks in London, Manchester, Paris, Tunisia and Bali. Brendan Cox, whose wife Jo Cox was murdered in 2016, helped co-ordinate the letter, while Bethany Haines, the daughter of the British aid worker David Haines who was killed by the Islamic State group, has also signed it. Dan Hett, whose brother Martyn was one of 22 victims to die in the Manchester Arena attack on 22 May last year, said terrorists hoped to ""turn our communities against each other"" by spreading fear. ""That's why we're asking people to join the fight against terror, by all playing our part,"" he said. ""Most importantly we're asking people to take on the hatred that leads to terror - no matter where it comes from, or who it's directed towards."" Manchester Arena attack: Tree trail to mark first anniversary Minute's silence to be held at Great Manchester Run Manchester bomb 'injured more than 800' Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Sunday programme, Mr Hett added that the group behind the letter - Survivors Against Terror - wanted to reach people earlier on in their lives. ""This is much more about being pro-active versus responsive once things happen,"" he said. Survivors Against Terror'splan to tackle terrorism Please keep your focus on honouring the memory of those who have been killed. Terrorists often attack partly to gain notoriety. We should deny them it; their names don't deserve to be remembered. Give to appeals to help the victims of attacks and demand government provide the high quality services that survivors need. Ask media and social media organisations to do far more to take on and shut down those driving hate. Support our emergency and security services to do their job. If you know something or suspect something, tell them. Take on hatred wherever you find it. Very few of us will ever meet a terrorist, but lots of us will experience those driving hatred. Hatred is the sea that terrorists need to swim in, if we take on that hatred, we dry up that sea. In addition to asking the public to address everyday prejudice and hatred, the letter said people should deny terrorists any ""notoriety"", support emergency and security services and donate to survivor advocacy and support groups. Social and traditional media also needed to ""do far more"" to ""shut down those driving hate"", the letter said. It continued: ""Hatred is the sea that terrorists need to swim in, if we take on that hatred, we dry up that sea.""

"Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich has faced delays in renewing his UK visa, the BBC understands. The Russian billionaire did not attend Saturday's FA Cup final at Wembley when the Blues beat Manchester United 1-0. A source close to the 51-year-old suggested he was in the process of renewing his visa, and said it was taking a little longer than usual. Asked about the visa, Security Minister Ben Wallace said: ""We do not routinely comment on individual cases."" Mr Abramovich's office said it does not discuss personal matters with the media. Reality Check: What's an investor visa? Reports suggest his investor visa expired three weeks ago. The delay comes amid increased diplomatic tensions between London and Moscow after the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal in Salisbury. BBC home affairs correspondent, Daniel Sandford said Mr Abramovich appears to be able to run his businesses in Russia without significant interference from the Kremlin, suggesting that he is reasonably close to President Vladimir Putin. But he said it was not clear if the delay in renewing his visa is in any way linked to the deterioration in relations between the two countries. This video can not be played The Chelsea football club owner's visa expired three weeks ago Mr Abramovich, who made his fortune in oil and gas in the 1990s, became owner of the companies that control Chelsea in 2003. According to the Sunday Times Rich List, he is Britain's 13th-richest man, with a net worth of Â£9.3bn. He owns a mansion on Kensington Palace Gardens, the most expensive street in London. Mr Abramovich is also the former governor of the remote Chukotka region in Russia's Far East. He has been a regular visitor to the UK since buying Chelsea, attending many of the home matches, and has been to Wembley for previous cup finals. His private Boeing 767 left the UK on 1 April. It has since travelled to Moscow, New York, Monaco and Switzerland but does not seem to have returned to Britain. Mr Abramovich (right) has often been spotted at Chelsea's Stamford Bridge ground The 51-year-old is one of Russia's richest billionaires He reportedly sold dolls before making his fortune in oil in the 1990s after the collapse of the former Soviet Union Mr Abramovich was a one-time business partner of the late tycoon Boris Berezovky, an associate of former Russian President Boris Yeltsin Critics say the two businessmen used their Kremlin ""family"" ties to acquire key state companies for below market value Abramovich served as governor of Russia's Chukotka region He is believed to be close to current Russian President Vladimir Putin Death toll rises amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

"Passengers have been urged to plan ahead and check revised timetables A rail timetable overhaul billed as the biggest in the UK has begun - but it may leave some users behind. Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) is rescheduling every train in its franchise, which includes Southern, Thameslink and Great Northern services. But passengers in a number of smaller locations complain they will be served with fewer or slower services. And the RMT union claims passengers with reduced mobility may be left behind if a train is at risk of delay. GTR said it placed high priority on making its services accessible to all. From Sunday every schedule for Thameslink, Southern, Gatwick Express and Great Northern trains will be different in an attempt to improve rail efficiency in the South East. It will mean 400 extra trains a day and new direct services from 80 stations into central London. Travel journalist Simon Calder said the overhaul would benefit some passengers, such as those travelling from Brighton to London where some rush hour services will be 15 minutes faster. But he said those journey times are faster because they miss out stops, adding: ""If you're one of the people who's waiting on the platform when the train goes through at 90 miles an hour instead of stopping - you're going to be a bit miffed."" And there appear to have been some teething problems,with cancellations and delays on trains run by Great Northern, Southern and Thameslink. GTR told the BBC that, ""as part of the huge logistical challenge of introducing this new timetable, some services are not initially running. We are working hard to minimise the impact this will have on our busiest trains. This situation will improve."" On Great Northern the new timetable has been scrapped and a short-term one is in place. New train timetable suspended on day one 'Disbelief and discontent' over timetable delays Network Rail puts new projects on hold Commuters 'priced off' UK trains - union GTR has for weeks reminded passengers to plan ahead, check revised timetables and expect their usual services to run at new times. The train operator does still anticipate delays and minor issues with services as staff and commuters adjust and trains and crew are redeployed. It has called the shake-up ""the biggest-ever change to rail timetables to significantly boost capacity on the UK's most congested network"". Ahead of the new timetable, the RMT said GTR staff had been given the instructions ""Do not attempt to place PRM [Persons of Reduced Mobility] on train if there is a possibility of delaying the service"" in a booklet outlining strategies for managing the time trains spend stopped at a station. 'I was stranded on a train in a wheelchair' RMT general secretary Mick Cash said: ""I cannot believe in this day and age we are telling staff to ignore the needs of disabled people if the time it will take to deploy a ramp and assist them onto the train will cause a delay."" Although the rail company did not deny the existence of such instructions, it said: "" Our policy remains the same which is to offer assistance to all passengers to help them with their journeys. ""We have a responsibility to make sure each service leaves on time to avoid knock-on delays, skipped station stops and cancellations to other services which would affect thousands of other passengers, many of whom may also be disabled,"" a GTR spokesperson said. Southern Rail services into London Bridge will have new timetables from Sunday The timetable changes mean some of the services will be faster and more frequent, while those that that typically suffer chronic delays will be deliberately slowed down to make arrival times more realistic. GTR is the largest rail franchise in the UK and its commuter services call into London stations such as St Pancras, London Bridge and London Victoria. It has said the schedule revamp will mean some services to and from commuter towns will be reduced, although total network capacity will increase. Emily Ketchin, founder of the campaign group Harpenden Thameslink Commuters' Group, says she and others commuting between Harpenden, Hertfordshire, and London, will be adversely affected. ""We are actually losing a third of key services in the morning, and also getting longer journey times, in the morning and in the evening,"" she told BBC Radio Five live. ""We currently have nine fast services and that is going down to six and it is totally unacceptable.  Even before these cuts it was a very overcrowded service. ""It is very difficult to get on a train and it is going to get a lot worse. And we pay Â£4,000 a year for that service."" Train company GTR said Harpenden services were being temporarily reduced because of upgrade works on the neighbouring Midland Mainline, which is being electrified from Bedford to Kettering and Corby. It said that planned extra train seats for Harpenden commuters would not now come into effect until 2020, when the route modernisation programme north of Bedford was completed.

"Dan Patrick believes gun control would endanger more people Arming more teachers could help tackle gunmen targeting students if there were ""four to five guns to one"", a senior Texan official has said. Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick was speaking two days after 10 people were killed at the Santa Fe High School, which had an armed guard. He had previously said schools had ""too many entrances and too many exits"" and their design should be reconsidered. The proposal to arm teachers is not a new idea. After a 14 February school shooting in Florida,US President Donald Trump suggested giving teachers a bonus if they carried guns. But he clarified via Twitter that ""only the best 20% of teachers"" - those with military backgrounds or special training - should be allowed guns. In depth: Is it time for US teachers to carry guns? Mr Patrick, a Republican, said the best way to stop a gunman was with a gun. ""But even better than that is four to five guns to one,"" he told CNN. Hours earlier, the police chief of neighbouring Houston said he had hit ""rock bottom"" over failure to enact gun reforms. Chief Art Acevedo wrote on Facebook that he had ""shed tears of sadness, pain and anger"" over the shooting. The shooting was the latest in a series of deadly incidents across the US that have reignited debate about gun control. Who are the victims? What we know about Texas shooting suspect America's gun culture in 10 charts Police now say eight students and two teachers were killed when another student opened fire in an art class shortly before 08:00 (13:00 GMT) on Friday at the Santa Fe High School. Thirteen others were wounded in the attack, with two in critical condition. Among the dead are a Pakistani exchange student and a substitute teacher. Dimitrios Pagourtzis, 17, has been charged with murder after surrendering to police. He later admitted ""to shooting multiple people"". He allegedly used a shotgun and a revolver taken from his father, who legally owned the weapons. This video can not be played ""It broke my heart to see what was going on"" - students at a vigil for the victims It was the fourth deadliest shooting at a US school in modern history, and the deadliest since a student opened fire in February at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, killing 17 people. The Florida attack spawned a nationwide youth-led campaign for gun control, and a series of proposed changes, including moves to ban so-called bump stocks used in last year's Las Vegas shooting that killed 58 concert-goers. Dan Patrick is a well-known proponent of gun ownership. He has advocated carrying weapons openly and concealed in Texas - and reiterated some of his views on Sunday, too. He told CNN's State of the Union programme that restricting school entrances and arming more teachers could reduce such incidents. ""When you're facing someone who's an active shooter, the best way to take that shooter down is with a gun. But even better than that is four to five guns to one,"" Mr Patrick said. ON ABC's This Week, he blamed a culture of violence. ""We have devalued life, whether it's through abortion, whether it's the breakup of families, through violent movies, and particularly violent video games."" Challenged over gun ownership that made it so deadly in the US - unlike in other countries that had the same social challenge - Mr Patrick said: ""Guns stop crimes."" Chief Acevedo runs the police department of America's fourth most populous city, Houston, which lies nearly 40 miles (64 km) north-west of Santa Fe. Houston police chief Art Acevedo (second left) joined the March for Our Lives in Texas two months ago demanding an end to gun violence ""I know some have strong feelings about gun rights but I want you to know I've hit rock bottom and I am not interested in your views as it pertains to this issue. Please do not post anything about guns aren't the problem and there's little we can do,""Chief Acevedo said in his Facebook post.,external ""This isn't a time for prayers, and study and inaction, it's a time for prayers, action and the asking of God's forgiveness for our inaction (especially the elected officials that ran to the cameras today, acted in a solemn manner, called for prayers, and will once again do absolutely nothing),"" he added. Is it time for US teachers to carry guns? Six radical ways to tackle US school shootings In just a few hours, his post had received more than 29,000 reactions and 15,590 shares. Chief Acevedo first spoke out about gun control in the aftermath of the Las Vegas shooting last October, and was a prominent figure in Texas's March for Our Lives demonstration following the Florida attack earlier this year. None of the victims has yet been identified by US authorities, but family members of the victims have spoken to media outlets. The embassy of Pakistan in Washington DC confirmed that exchange student Sabika Sheikh, 17, was among the dead. She had been on a special study abroad programme set up by the state department in the aftermath of the 11 September 2001 attacks to bring students from Muslim-majority nations to the US on a cultural exchange. Pakistani exchange student Sabika Sheikh, 17, was among the dead Substitute teacher Cynthia Tisdale was also killed in the attack, her family told US media outlets. Ms Tisdale's brother-in-law John Tisdale described her on Facebook as an ""amazing person"". The LA Times says it has spoken to the mother of another victim, 16-year-old Shana Fisher,external, who she said had ""had four months of problems from this boy"" - referring to the gunman. ""He kept making advances on her and she repeatedly told him no,"" the mother Sadie Rodriguez said, adding that her daughter finally stood up to him and embarrassed him in class a week before the shooting. The other victims who have been named by US media are: Jared Black, 17 - student Christian Garcia, 15 - student Aaron McLeod, 15 - student Ann Perkins, 64 - substitute teacher Angelique Ramirez, 15 - student Chris Stone, 17- student Kimberly Vaughan, no age given - student The 17-year-old suspect has been charged with capital murder and aggravated assault of a public servant. Court documents revealed on Saturday that the suspect - who waived his right to remain silent and admitted to the shooting - told police he had spared certain students he liked ""so he could have his story told"". This video can not be played Dimitrios Pagourtzis was read his rights after his arrest on Friday One of his two lawyers, Nicholas Poehl, told Reuters news agency his client was ""very emotional and weirdly nonemotional"".

"Cougar attacks on humans are extremely rare US wildlife officers in Washington state have shot dead a cougar that killed a cyclist and mauled another.

"This video can not be played Doctor Jose Luis Castellano described the crash site as ""very painful"" to behold The Mexican charter company whose plane crashed in Cuba on Friday, killing 110 people on board, had received prior safety complaints, two-ex pilots say. One of the pilots described how a plane rented from Damojh airlines had dropped off radar completely some eight years ago. Another alleged poor maintenance. Mexican authorities say they will carry out a safety audit of the company. Three women survived the crash near Havana airport - Cuba's deadliest air disaster in more than 30 years. Separately, it was revealed that 10 Protestant evangelical priests and their wives were among the crash victims. Miraculous plane crash survivors Cuba country profile Major air disasters timeline Cuban authorities have launched an investigation into the crash, as rescuers continue to comb through the wreckage site some 20km (12 miles) south of the Cuban capital. One of two ""black boxes"" that hold key flight data and information about what happened to the plane has been recovered and is said to be in good condition. Allegations of previous safety complaints have emerged against the Mexican-based Damojh company, which leased both the Boeing 737 and its crew to Cuba's flagship state Cubana airline. The head of Guyana's civil aviation body, Cpt Egbert Field, told the Associated Press news agency the same plane - which was nearly 40 years old - had been barred from using Guyanese airspace last year after authorities found its crew were overloading luggage on flights in Cuba. In one instance, the news agency reports,Guyanese authorities had discovered suitcases stored in the plane's toilets.,external The plane crashed in a field near Havana international airport Meanwhile, a retired pilot for Cubana wrote on Facebook that another plane rented by his airline from the same company had briefly dropped off radar for unspecified reasons while over the central Cuban city of Santa Clara in 2010 or 2011. The captain and co-pilot of that flight were later suspended for ""problems and serious lack of technical knowledge,"" said Ovidio Martinez Lopez, who worked for Cubana for more than 40 years. He said ""many flight attendants, flight attendants and flight safety personnel"" had refused to fly on certain Cubana planes over the years. Another pilot who used to work for Damojh told Mexican newspaper Milenio he had complained about a lack of adequate maintenance of planes. ""I experienced several incidents at this company, like engine failure or the electrical system went when we took off from Mexico on one occasion"", Marco Aurelio Hernandez was quoted as saying. The company has yet to comment on the allegations. Cuba's transport minister said on Saturday that five children were among the victims.

"This video can not be played Mr Gill was speaking with Vaughan Roderick on BBC Radio Wales' Sunday Supplement UKIP has no future and should fold if the right Brexit deal is done, the party's former leader in Wales has said. MEP Nathan Gill said the party ""could have been amazing"" in Wales but had achieved nothing - due to internal rows. Mr Gill, whoquit the assembly after infighting, said if Brexit was done properly UKIP would be ""dead"". UKIP said Mr Gill did not speak for the party which would continue post Brexit. Mr Gill's comments come after former Tory MP Neil Hamilton was ousted as leader ofUKIP's assembly group on Thursday, and replaced by AM Caroline Jones. Mr Gill, who quit hisassembly job in January amid pressure about ""double-jobbing""as an AM and MEP, said there was no future for UKIP if the UK Conservative government delivered the right Brexit deal.

"This video can not be played Mr Gill was speaking with Vaughan Roderick on BBC Radio Wales' Sunday Supplement UKIP has no future and should fold if the right Brexit deal is done, the party's former leader in Wales has said. MEP Nathan Gill said the party ""could have been amazing"" in Wales but had achieved nothing - due to internal rows. Mr Gill, whoquit the assembly after infighting, said if Brexit was done properly UKIP would be ""dead"". UKIP said Mr Gill did not speak for the party which would continue post Brexit. Mr Gill's comments come after former Tory MP Neil Hamilton was ousted as leader ofUKIP's assembly group on Thursday, and replaced by AM Caroline Jones. Mr Gill, who quit hisassembly job in January amid pressure about ""double-jobbing""as an AM and MEP, said there was no future for UKIP if the UK Conservative government delivered the right Brexit deal. He told BBC Radio Wales'Sunday Supplement: ""It is all up to the Tories...if they fail to deliver that, UKIP can revive from the ashes, but they can kill us dead by delivering a good, solid, decent Brexit.

"This video can not be played Tech companies ignored invite to government meeting about online behaviour, says Matt Hancock The culture secretary has agreed he does not have enough power to police social media firms after admitting only four of 14 invited to talks showed up. Matt Hancock told the BBC it had given him ""a big impetus"" to introduce new laws to tackle what he has called the internet's ""Wild West"" culture. He admitted self-policing had not worked and legislation was needed. But Labour's Tom Watson said the government had ""squandered"" chances to ""get tough on the tech giants"". Mr Hancock told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show, presented by Emma Barnett, that the government ""just don't know"" how many children of the millions using using social media were not old enough for an account and he was ""very worried"" about age verification. Four of the biggest hazards of social media Facebook's Zuckerberg faces formal summons from MPs Germany starts enforcing hate speech law He said that as part of the Data Protection Bill currently going through Parliament, firms could be fined up to 4% of their global turnover - which could run to more than Â£1bn for the biggest firms. Asked what the threshold would be for firms to be hit with fines, in terms of underage children on certain platforms, he said: ""I'm not going to give a figure because we are going to consult on it."" He told the programme he hopes ""we get to a position"" where all users of social media have to get their age verified. Codes of conduct would be examined he said as existing ""terms of reference"" were often not enforced properly. Asked how many of the 14 firms invited to attend government talks had showed up, he replied: ""Four."" By BBC political correspondent Jonathan Blake Governments love to talk tough, but sooner or later they have to back it up with action. The culture secretary has admitted that calling on technology companies to ""step up"" and ""do more"" has only got ministers so far. But efforts to regulate the internet have had limited success. A plan to introduce age verification for all porn sites was due to come into force in April, but has been delayed with no details given about how it might work. An ""opt in"" system where internet service providers ask people if they want to access adult content has seen sex education and suicide prevention advice inadvertently blocked. A new law in Germany forcing social networks to remove hate speech within 24 hours is being revised after complaints that too much content was being blocked. Two government departments are working on the new laws aimed at holding technology companies to account. They have a difficult, if not impossible, task. He said: ""One of the problems we have got is that we engage with Facebook, Google and Twitter and they get all of the press, they get all of the complaints in the public debate but there's now actually a far greater number of social media platforms like musical.ly. ""They didn't show up and the companies, they have now got over a million on their site."" He said that this, and the difficulties getting Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg to answer MPs' questions showed Britain did not have the power needed: ""That's one of the reasons we are legislating. ""The fact that only four companies turned up when I invited the 14 biggest in gave me a big impetus to drive this proposal to legislate through."" Pushed for details of how quickly social media firms would have to remove terrorist content to avoid a fine, he said: ""We should be very ambitious,"" but said a set timescale could mean companies ""work up to that timescale"", while he would prefer them to do so ""as quickly as possible"". According to a consultation carried out last year, following the Internet Safety Green Paper, four out of 10 people had experienced abuse online and 60% had seen inappropriate content. Digital Minister Margot James told Sky's Ridge on Sunday she had received abuse and reported it to the police. She added: ""It's not just of parliamentarians, it's any woman in public life, and some of our famous broadcasters have had the most terrible abuse online which is completely unacceptable - if it's not illegal it should be and I think some of it is."" Two government departments are working on a White Paper expected to be brought forward later this year. Asked about the same issue on ITV's Peston on Sunday, Mr Hancock said the government would be legislating ""in the next couple of years"" because ""we want to get the details right"". Barnardo's chief executive officer Javed Khan urged the government to consider legislation ""that ends the era of technology self-regulation and puts children's safety at the heart of the online world"". But shadow culture secretary Tom Watson said: ""It's embarrassing that the social media companies don't even take Matt Hancock seriously enough to show up to meet him. ""The data protection bill was the opportunity to get tough on the tech giants and the government has squandered that. ""They voted down Labour's proposal for a digital bill of rights that would have given adults and children stronger statutory protections online."" There have been a number of efforts by politicians to curb intimidation and abuse on social media. In February Theresa May announced a crackdown on the intimidation of political candidates and highlighted the ""coarsening and toxifying of our public debate"" on social media. Mr Hancock's predecessor, Karen Bradley, said that Facebook and Twitter could be asked to help fund campaigns against abuse while the European Commission flagged up delays by social networks in preventing and removing hate speech. Former Home Secretary Amber Rudd last year accused technology experts of ""sneering"" at politicians who tried to regulate their industry.

"Cougar attacks on humans are extremely rare US wildlife officers in Washington state have shot dead a cougar that killed a cyclist and mauled another. The two cyclists were in North Bend, about 30 miles (50km) from Seattle, when the attack occurred. The injured man used his mobile phone to seek help. The rider who died was dragged away by the cougar to its den, said King County sheriff spokesman Sergeant Ryan Abbot. Wildlife officials said it was only the second fatal cougar attack in Washington state in the past 100 years. Tracker dogs were used to locate the animal, hours after the attack. Cougars - also known as mountain lions - are the fourth largest cat species in the world, but they rarely attack humans. Wildlife officials however say more cougar attacks have been reported in the western US and Canada over the past 20 years than in the previous 80.

"GÃ¼ndogan (left) and Ãzil met the German president in Berlin Two German footballers of Turkish origin have met President Frank-Walter Steinmeier after criticism of photos showing them with Turkey's president. Turkey's governing AK Party released the photos of them with Recep Tayyip Erdogan ahead of elections there. Some German politicians said it seemed Mesut Ãzil and Ilkay GÃ¼ndogan were endorsing Mr Erdogan - which they deny. Germany has criticised the Turkish leader's crackdown on political dissent following a failed coup. Ãzil, who plays for Arsenal, and Manchester City player GÃ¼ndogan gave Mr Erdogan signed shirts at an event in London last week. Both players are preparing to play in next month's Fifa World Cup in Russia, where Germany is among the favourites. Turkey did not qualify. The German football federation (DFB) had also criticised the pair. ""The two players contacted us and the DFB and wanted to clear this issue up,"" Germany coach Joachim Loew told reporters. They met President Frank-Walter Steinmeier at the presidential palace in Berlin. ""It was important to both of them to clear up the misunderstandings,""  said President Steinmeier. He said that Ãzil had told him he stood by Germany, while GÃ¼ndogan affirmed that ""Germany is clearly my country and my team"". ""Both assured us that they had not wanted to send any political signal with that action,"" DFB President Reinhard Grindel said. ""They also stated that they stand for our values on and off the pitch and that they identify with them."" Turkey's pugnacious president Erdogan's Turkey - the full story Mesut Ãzil (L) presented President Erdogan with his Arsenal shirt last week Mr Erdogan, in power for the past 15 years, is seeking re-election in a snap poll on 24 June. His Islamist-rooted AK Party has cracked down hard on opponents, especially since the July 2016 coup attempt by military officers. Turkish police have arrested more than 50,000 people accused of links to US-based Islamic cleric Fethullah Gulen or to Kurdish separatists. They include opposition activists, journalists, teachers, lawyers and other public servants. Mr Erdogan has also purged the military, police and judiciary, putting many state officials on trial. After the criticism of last week's meeting, GÃ¼ndogan issued a statement defending himself, Ãzil and a third player of Turkish origin Cenk Tosun over their meeting with Mr Erdogan. They met on the sidelines of an event at a Turkish foundation that helps Turkish students, he explained. ""Are we supposed to be impolite to the president of our families' homeland?"" he asked. ""Whatever justified criticism there might be, we decided on a gesture of politeness, out of respect for the office of president and for our Turkish roots.""

"The Duchess of Sussex has followed tradition by having her bridal bouquet placed on the tomb of the unknown warrior at Westminster Abbey. The royal tradition, started by the Queen Mother, usually takes place the day after the wedding. Meghan paid tribute to Prince Harry's mother, Princess Diana, at their wedding by including forget-me-nots, her favourite flowers, in the bouquet. It also contained flowers handpicked by the prince at Kensington Palace. Royal Family thanks public after wedding Five moments to remember from the royal wedding Meghan Markle's Givenchy dress in detail It was designed by London-based florist Philippa Craddock, who also created the floral displays for St George's Chapel and St George's Hall using locally sourced foliage. Myrtle sprigs from stems planted by Queen Victoria at Osborne House, on the Isle of Wight, in 1845 were included, as well as sprigs taken from a plant grown from the myrtle used in the Queen's wedding bouquet in 1947. The plant became a family favourite after Queen Victoria was given myrtle by Prince Albert's grandmother during a visit to Gotha in Germany. Later that year, the couple bought Osborne House as a family retreat and they planted the sprig against the terrace walls, where it continues to bloom. It then became tradition for royal brides to carry the plant after Queen Victoria's eldest daughter, Princess Victoria, used it in her bouquet in 1858 - including the Duchess of Cambridge and Princess Diana. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on their wedding day (l) alongside Prince Harry and Meghan Markle (r) The petite bouquet carried by Meghan also contained scented sweet peas, lily of the valley, astilbe, jasmine and astrantia. Lily of the valley - the birth flower for May - is said to represent love and appreciation, the astilbe is said to symbolise patience and dedication, and astrantia means strength and courage. The flowers were then bound with a naturally dyed, raw silk ribbon. The Queen Mother began the tradition of leaving the flowers on the grave in Westminster Abbey in 1923 after her wedding to the Duke of York - who later became King George VI. The Duke of York and Lady Elizabeth Bowes Lyon on their wedding day in 1923 She is said to have left the flowers there in tribute to her brother Fergus, who was killed in 1915 during World War One. The Duchess of Cambridge also followed the tradition by having her bouquet left on the grave in 2011. The grave - which is at the west of the Nave of the Abbey - contains the body of a soldier brought back from France after World War One. He was buried on Remembrance Day, 11 November, in 1920, along with soil from the country. The idea is thought to have come from a chaplain, the Reverend David Railton, who served at the front during the war, after he saw a grave in a back garden in France with the words ""an unknown British soldier"" pencilled on. A large public ceremony took place for the burial, which included King George V laying a wreath of red roses and bay leaves on the coffin. The grave is covered by a slab of black Belgian marble and contains a long inscription, including the words: ""They buried him among the kings because he had done good toward God and toward his house.""

"Twenty-two people were killed in the Manchester Arena attack on 22 May last year The public must do more to tackle terrorism by standing up to hate, a group of terror attack survivors and relatives has said. In an open letter released ahead of the Manchester bombing anniversary on Tuesday, they set out a five-point plan to help stop future plots. Among the 41 signatories is the widow of murdered Fusilier Lee Rigby. Others are survivors and relatives of those killed in attacks in London, Manchester, Paris, Tunisia and Bali. Brendan Cox, whose wife Jo Cox was murdered in 2016, helped co-ordinate the letter, while Bethany Haines, the daughter of the British aid worker David Haines who was killed by the Islamic State group, has also signed it. Dan Hett, whose brother Martyn was one of 22 victims to die in the Manchester Arena attack on 22 May last year, said terrorists hoped to ""turn our communities against each other"" by spreading fear. ""That's why we're asking people to join the fight against terror, by all playing our part,"" he said. ""Most importantly we're asking people to take on the hatred that leads to terror - no matter where it comes from, or who it's directed towards."" Manchester Arena attack: Tree trail to mark first anniversary Minute's silence to be held at Great Manchester Run Manchester bomb 'injured more than 800' Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Sunday programme, Mr Hett added that the group behind the letter - Survivors Against Terror - wanted to reach people earlier on in their lives. ""This is much more about being pro-active versus responsive once things happen,"" he said. Survivors Against Terror'splan to tackle terrorism Please keep your focus on honouring the memory of those who have been killed. Terrorists often attack partly to gain notoriety. We should deny them it; their names don't deserve to be remembered. Give to appeals to help the victims of attacks and demand government provide the high quality services that survivors need. Ask media and social media organisations to do far more to take on and shut down those driving hate. Support our emergency and security services to do their job. If you know something or suspect something, tell them. Take on hatred wherever you find it. Very few of us will ever meet a terrorist, but lots of us will experience those driving hatred. Hatred is the sea that terrorists need to swim in, if we take on that hatred, we dry up that sea. In addition to asking the public to address everyday prejudice and hatred, the letter said people should deny terrorists any ""notoriety"", support emergency and security services and donate to survivor advocacy and support groups. Social and traditional media also needed to ""do far more"" to ""shut down those driving hate"", the letter said. It continued: ""Hatred is the sea that terrorists need to swim in, if we take on that hatred, we dry up that sea.""

"Twenty-two people were killed in the Manchester Arena attack on 22 May last year The public must do more to tackle terrorism by standing up to hate, a group of terror attack survivors and relatives has said. In an open letter released ahead of the Manchester bombing anniversary on Tuesday, they set out a five-point plan to help stop future plots. Among the 41 signatories is the widow of murdered Fusilier Lee Rigby. Others are survivors and relatives of those killed in attacks in London, Manchester, Paris, Tunisia and Bali. Brendan Cox, whose wife Jo Cox was murdered in 2016, helped co-ordinate the letter, while Bethany Haines, the daughter of the British aid worker David Haines who was killed by the Islamic State group, has also signed it. Dan Hett, whose brother Martyn was one of 22 victims to die in the Manchester Arena attack on 22 May last year, said terrorists hoped to ""turn our communities against each other"" by spreading fear. ""That's why we're asking people to join the fight against terror, by all playing our part,"" he said. ""Most importantly we're asking people to take on the hatred that leads to terror - no matter where it comes from, or who it's directed towards."" Manchester Arena attack: Tree trail to mark first anniversary Minute's silence to be held at Great Manchester Run Manchester bomb 'injured more than 800' Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Sunday programme, Mr Hett added that the group behind the letter - Survivors Against Terror - wanted to reach people earlier on in their lives. ""This is much more about being pro-active versus responsive once things happen,"" he said. Survivors Against Terror'splan to tackle terrorism Please keep your focus on honouring the memory of those who have been killed. Terrorists often attack partly to gain notoriety. We should deny them it; their names don't deserve to be remembered. Give to appeals to help the victims of attacks and demand government provide the high quality services that survivors need. Ask media and social media organisations to do far more to take on and shut down those driving hate. Support our emergency and security services to do their job. If you know something or suspect something, tell them. Take on hatred wherever you find it. Very few of us will ever meet a terrorist, but lots of us will experience those driving hatred. Hatred is the sea that terrorists need to swim in, if we take on that hatred, we dry up that sea. In addition to asking the public to address everyday prejudice and hatred, the letter said people should deny terrorists any ""notoriety"", support emergency and security services and donate to survivor advocacy and support groups. Social and traditional media also needed to ""do far more"" to ""shut down those driving hate"", the letter said. It continued: ""Hatred is the sea that terrorists need to swim in, if we take on that hatred, we dry up that sea."" Bishop of Manchester David Walker added: ""The way we defy terrorism is by not going down that path of hate.""

"This video can not be played Freya Lewis, 15, was the honorary starter in the 2.5k junior race, in which she also took part A minute's silence has been held at the Great Manchester Run in tribute to those who died in last year's terror attack in the city. Twenty-two people were killed by a suicide bomber at an Ariana Grande concert on 22 May. Some of the survivors took part in the race, including Martin Hibbert who was paralysed from the waist down. Sir Mo Farah won the men's 10K run while Ethiopia's Tirunesh Dibaba came first in the women's event. David Weir triumphed in the men's wheelchair race and Liz McTernan won the women's contest. Martin Hibbert (right) competed after surviving the arena attack Participants and spectators sang along to Don't Look Back in Anger by Oasis after the silence. About 30,000 people took part in the races, making it the third largest running event in the UK Luthfur Rahman, from Manchester City Council, said: ""It will have real resonance, after last year's event epitomised Manchester's spirit of togetherness following the heinous attack on our city."" The 2017 run took place six days after the attack, which left more than 800 people with physical and psychological injuries. Tirunesh Dibaba (right) won the women's event Last year, the Great Manchester Run became a symbol of solidarity after the attack at the arena just a few days before. So it felt fitting for a silence to take place before the runners began their 10k event this time round. There was applause when survivor and race participant Martin Hibbert was introduced, while signs commemorating the victims were held up by some members of the crowd. After the silence, the crowd broke into applause before Don't Look Back In Anger was played over the loudspeakers. It was an emotional moment for all those present. Mr Hibbert, who took part in the 10k in a wheelchair, is fundraising for the three hospitals that treated him and his daughter. He hopes to raise a total of Â£1m by competing in various races during the next 12 months, including the Boston Marathon. He said deciding to participate ""felt right"", adding: ""I didn't think about how tough it would be, if I could even do it."" Sir Mo Farah celebrated his win with his family Freya Lewis, 15, who was seriously injured, said she was ""overwhelmed"" after being the honorary starter in the junior event, in which she also took part. Along with her father Nick, she is raising money for the hospital that treated her. ""I wanted to give something back because they gave so much to me,"" she said.

"This video can not be played Dimitrios Pagourtzis is read his rights after his arrest The Santa Fe High School shooting suspect told police he spared certain students he liked ""so he could have his story told"", a court document shows. Dimitrios Pagourtzis has been charged with murder after 10 people were shot dead on Friday in the Texas town. According to an affidavit filed in court, Mr Pagourtzis, 17, waived his right to remain silent and admitted ""to shooting multiple people"". Authorities said he exchanged gunfire with police before surrendering. The gun battle went on for about 15 minutes before Mr Pagourtzis gave himself up, abandoning a plan to take his own life, the New York Times reported. Police now say that eight students and two teachers were killed, with 13 people wounded in the attack, including one of the school's policemen who is in critical condition. The 17-year-old suspect, Dimitrios Pagourtzis The details in the affidavit, released by the Galveston County District Attorney's Office, appeared to shed some new light on Mr Pagourtzis's arrest inside the school building. The documents said he emerged from the school's Art Lab 2 classroom at 08:02 on Friday, about 30 minutes after the first reports of a shooting, and surrendered. Authorities said two apparent improvised explosive devices he brought to the scene turned out to be harmless. The affidavit also said Mr Pagourtzis was wearing a trench coat and had a Remington 870 shotgun and a .38 calibre pistol. Previous testimony from students described him as wearing a long black trench coat. One student, Breanna Quintanilla, told the Associated Press that Mr Pagourtzis walked into the classroom she was in, pointed at someone, and said: ""I'm going to kill you."" Ms Quintanilla was wounded in her leg as she fled. This video can not be played ""It broke my heart to see what was going on"" Mr Pagourtzis has been charged with capital murder and aggravated assault of a public servant. The first charge means he could face the death penalty. He appeared ""weirdly non-emotional"" on the morning after the shooting, one of his lawyers said on Saturday. Nicholas Poehl, one of two lawyers hired by the suspect's parents, told Reuters news agency he had spent an hour with the suspect on Friday night and Saturday morning. ""He's very emotional and weirdly nonemotional,"" the attorney said. ""There are aspects of it he understands and there are aspects he doesn't understand."" Santa Fe High School shooting as it happened What we know about Texas shooting suspect America's gun culture in 10 charts Mr Pagourtzis's family said in a statement they were ""saddened and dismayed"" by the shooting and ""as shocked as anyone else"" by the events. They said they were co-operating with investigators. Authorities said there were few if any outward signs that Mr Pagourtzis was planning an attack. ""Unlike Parkland, unlike Sutherland Springs, there were not those types of warning signs,"" said Texas Governor Greg Abbott. ""We have what are often categorized as red-flag warnings, and here, the red-flag warnings were either nonexistent or very imperceptible."" Mr Pagourtzis suggested in social media posts that he was an atheist and said: ""I hate politics"". On 30 April he posted a photograph of a T-shirt bearing the slogan ""Born to Kill"". Pakistani exchange student Sabika Sheikh, 17, was among the dead None of the victims has yet been identified by US authorities, but some have been named separately. The embassy of Pakistan in Washington DC confirmed that exchange student Sabika Sheikh, 17, was among the dead. Substitute teacher Cynthia Tisdale was also killed in the attack, her family told US media outlets. Ms Tisdale's niece and brother-in-law both confirmed the news. Writing on Facebook, John Tisdale said his sister-in-law was an ""amazing person"". Is it time for US teachers to carry guns? Six radical ways to tackle US school shootings Ms Sheikh was on the Kennedy-Lugar Youth Exchange & Study Abroad programme (YES). The programme is run by the US state department, and was set up in the aftermath of the 11 September 2001 attacks to bring students from Muslim-majority nations to the US on a cultural exchange. A vigil was held on Friday night for the victims. A professional athlete from the state - JJ Watt, of the Houston Texans NFL team - offered to pay the funeral expenses of the victims.

"This video can not be played The plane came down in a field near Havana's main airport Cuban officials say they have found one of the two black boxes from a plane that crashed near Havana airport, killing more than 100 people, in ""good condition"". Transport Minister Adel Yzquierdo says he hopes the second device will be recovered soon. He revised the official death toll up to 110 people, including 11 foreigners. Three women survived the crash, but are said to be in a critical condition with serious burns. The incident is Cuba's worst air disaster in decades, and two days of national mourning began on Saturday. Officials said investigators are combing through the wreckage of the plane, a Boeing 737 which was nearly 40 years old, at the field where it crashed some 20km (12 miles) south of the Cuban capital. The black box which has already been recovered will hold key flight data and information about what happened to the plane. Cuba country profile Major air disasters timeline Mr Yzquierdo told journalists that the 110 dead included 99 Cubans, six Mexican crew members, two tourists from Argentina, one from Mexico, and two passengers from Western Sahara. The Argentine couple were named by their government as Dora Beatriz Cifuentes and Oscar Hugo Almaras, both in their sixties. Several victims' relatives have travelled to Havana to help identify the deceased. The first secretary of Communist Party in HolguÃ­n comforts relatives of the crash victims Those coming from HolguÃ­n - the plane's intended destination - and other eastern parts of Cuba made the 700km (435-mile) trip on buses, escorted by the National Revolutionary Police, EFE news agency reported. President Miguel Diaz-Canel has visited the morgue where the victims are being identified. Cuban authorities do not plan to release the full list of the dead until all victims' families have been informed. The Boeing 737-201 crashed at 12:08 (16:08 GMT) on Friday, shortly after taking off from Havana on an internal flight to HolguÃ­n. It's too early to say what caused the crash, but eyewitnesses on the ground described seeing the jet burst into flames before crashing into a field close to a wooded area near the airport. Wreckage was spread over a large area ""I saw it taking off,"" supermarket worker Jose Luis told the AFP news agency. ""All of a sudden, it made a turn, and went down. We were all amazed."" ""We heard an explosion and then saw a big cloud of smoke go up,"" Gilberto Menendez, who runs a restaurant near the crash site, told Reuters. Mexico's transport department said on its website that ""during take-off (the plane) apparently suffered a problem and dived to the ground"". Boeing said that it was ready to send a technical team to Cuba, ""as permitted under US law and at the direction of the US National Transportation Safety Board and Cuban authorities"". A US trade embargo has been in force against Cuba for many decades. Four people initially survived the crash but one died after being taken to hospital, the director of Havana's Calixto Garcia hospital, Carlos Alberto Martinez, told Reuters. The three survivors are all women, according to Cuban Communist Party newspaper Granma: one aged between 18 and 25, one in her thirties and the third aged 39. A survivor of the plane crash attended by emergency workers ""She is alive but very burnt and swollen,"" one of the women's relatives at the hospital told Reuters. By Will Grant, BBC Cuba Correspondent Two days of national mourning have begun, with the entire island sharing a little of the pain of the many families affected by the disaster. But in their grief, people also want answers. They are demanding an explanation as to why a routine flight from Havana came crashing down in a field barely a minute after it took off, with over 100 passengers and crew on board. The country's new President, Miguel Diaz-Canel, faces his first real test in providing those answers. He visited the crash site to thank the emergency services and announced an investigation was already under way. Flags are flying at half-mast in Cuba as the island grieves the disaster It emerged that the previous President, RaÃºl Castro, was recuperating from minor surgery on a hernia, and he too expressed his condolences to the victims' families. The families of the survivors face an anxious wait to see if they will pull through, and their countrymen are praying that at least some will have survived this catastrophe. The plane had been leased to state airline Cubana de AviaciÃ³n by the Mexican company Aerolineas Damojh. The Mexican authorities said the plane was built in 1979 and had been successfully inspected last November. Mexico earlier said it was sending two civil aviation specialists to join the investigation. Aerolineas Damojh, also known as Global Air, has three planes in operation. Crowds of shocked onlookers gathered at the crash site According to industry research,last year was the safest in history for commercial airline travelwith no passenger jet crashes. But there have been several serious air disasters this year. Last month, a military plane crashed shortly after take-off in Algeria, killing more than 250 people In February, a Saratov Airlines plane crashed near Moscow, killing 71 people In March, a US-Bangla Airlines flight crashed in Kathmandu, Nepal; 51 people died Cuba's deadliest air crash was in 1989, when a Soviet-made Ilyushin-62M passenger plane crashed near Havana, killing 126 people on board and another 24 people on the ground.

"The Church of Scotland has moved a step closer to allowing ministers to conduct same-sex marriages. The Kirk's General Assembly backed a motion which tasked a committee with drafting church law on the issue. Its legal questions committee was asked to report back to the annual meeting of the decision-making body in 2020. Under the plans outlined in the motion, ministers and deacons would be allowed to conduct same-sex weddings ""if they wish"". The motion was carried by 345 votes to 170 and the result was announced on the Church of Scotland's official Twitter feed. The move comes almost a year after theScottish Episcopal Church voted to allow gay couples to marry in church. It became the first major Christian church in the UK to allow same-sex marriage.

A minister of Dornoch Cathedral in the Highlands,she was previously known for presiding over the wedding of Madonna and Guy Ritchiein 2000. Her appointment came in the year the Church marks the 50th anniversary of the ordination of women. The 59-year-old is the fourth woman to hold the title. Speaking before the ceremony, Mrs Brown said: ""The prospect of becoming Moderator of the General Assembly is slightly scary but incredibly exciting. ""It will be a challenging year but I am really up for it. ""As the ambassador for the Church, I am really looking forward to meeting people and hearing their stories as my theme is 'walking with'. ""I also want to highlight how important walking, which is an ancient spiritual tradition, is for our physical and mental health, an issue that I plan to raise with political leaders."" The Right Rev Susan Brown was installed as Moderator in a ceremony at the beginning of the General Assembly. Nicola Sturgeon and the Duke of Buccleuch, who represented the Queen as Lord High Commissioner to the Assembly, were at the ceremony. During the ceremony her predecessor, the Very Rev Dr Derek Browning, welcomed the new Moderator saying, ""full-blooded, soul-warming, kind-hearted parish ministry,"" has been the centre of her work. ""On this year when we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the ordination of women to the Ministry of Word and Sacrament it is particularly special that you as a committed parish minister will be our Moderator,"" Dr Browning added, ""It is also a delight that having served in two Highland parishes that you will also represent that important part of our country for the first time in a number of years."" About 730 commissioners from Scotland and beyond are attending the General Assembly on The Mound to make decisions on matters of Kirk policy and governance. The Duke of Buccleuch was given an official welcome to Holyrood Palace in Edinburgh on Friday During the Church of Scotland's Assembly on Tuesday, a public procession will take place to mark 50 years of the ordination of women within the Kirk. Nearly 300 people are expected to take part in the event in central Edinburgh, exactly half a century on from the Assembly's decision in 1968 to permit women to become ministers. Wednesday brings discussion of a report from the Church and Society Council, which proposes the Kirk ""should, over the next two years, divest from fossil fuel companies unless there is clear evidence that these companies are themselves modifying their policy and practice"". The General Assembly meets for a week every year in May. It has the authority to make laws determining how the Church operates and can also act as the Kirk's highest court.

Santa Fe High School shooting as it happened What we know about Texas shooting suspect America's gun culture in 10 charts Mr Pagourtzis's family said in a statement they were ""saddened and dismayed"" by the shooting and ""as shocked as anyone else"" by the events. They said they were co-operating with investigators. Authorities said there were few if any outward signs that Mr Pagourtzis was planning an attack. ""Unlike Parkland, unlike Sutherland Springs, there were not those types of warning signs,"" said Texas Governor Greg Abbott. ""We have what are often categorized as red-flag warnings, and here, the red-flag warnings were either nonexistent or very imperceptible."" Mr Pagourtzis suggested in social media posts that he was an atheist and said: ""I hate politics"". On 30 April he posted a photograph of a T-shirt bearing the slogan ""Born to Kill"". Pakistani exchange student Sabika Sheikh, 17, was among the dead None of the victims has yet been identified by US authorities, but some have been named separately. The embassy of Pakistan in Washington DC confirmed that exchange student Sabika Sheikh, 17, was among the dead. Substitute teacher Cynthia Tisdale was also killed in the attack, her family told US media outlets. Ms Tisdale's niece and brother-in-law both confirmed the news.

The programme is run by the US state department, and was set up in the aftermath of the 11 September 2001 attacks to bring students from Muslim-majority nations to the US on a cultural exchange. A vigil was held on Friday night for the victims. A professional athlete from the state - JJ Watt, of the Houston Texans NFL team - offered to pay the funeral expenses of the victims.

"The suspect has been booked into the Galveston County Jail He was in a church dance club. He played on the school football team. He was a high-achieving student. And yet he allegedly opened fire on classmates, killing 10 people. Officials say there were few red flags from Dimitrios Pagourtzis, the 17-year-old facing capital murder charges over Friday's Santa Fe High School shooting in Texas. Texas Governor Greg Abbott said a photo on the suspect's now-deleted Facebook page showing a T-shirt with the phrase Born to Kill may be the only warning sign. ""But as far as investigations by law enforcement agencies, as far as arrests or confrontation with law enforcement, as far as having a criminal history, he has none,"" he told a news conference. Ten dead in Texas high school shooting ""His slate is pretty clean. There simply were not the same type of warning signs that we've seen in so many other shootings."" The 17-year-old suspect, Dimitrios Pagourtzis However, hours before he allegedly stormed into an art class armed with a shotgun and revolver the teenager made a weird post on social media, a law enforcement source told CBS News. Accompanied by an occult symbol, it said simply, ""Dangerous Days"". He had also previously posted an image of a trench coat pinned with various insignia, including the Iron Cross used by the Nazis, which the teen wrote represented ""bravery"". This video can not be played How the Texas school shooting unfolded The Communist hammer and sickle pin, he said, stood for ""rebellion"", and a depiction of the idol Baphomet symbolised ""Evil"". Student Dustin Severin told KPRC-TV that he saw the teen in the hall before the shooting wearing his usual outfit of black boots and a trench coat. He said the suspect had been picked on by school coaches ""for smelling bad"", and had mostly kept to himself. One of his teachers told the New York Times: ""He was quiet, but he wasn't quiet in a creepy way."" Police say the teenager detailed his plans to carry out the school shooting in a diary, on his computer and on a mobile phone. The suspect had planned to take his own life, say investigators, but he ultimately gave himself up. And yet there were many other signs that Dimitrios Pagourtzis was a regular, outgoing teenager full of promise. School officials say he was previously on the school's ""honour roll"" of high-achievers, and was expected to graduate in 2019. According to local media, he was a member of a dance squad with a local Greek Orthodox church. He had also played for the Santa Fe High School Indians American football team for the 2015-16 season.

"Data shows gun ownership in the US has grown over the last several years Gun violence is a fixture in American life - but the issue is a highly political one, pitting gun control advocates against people who are fiercely protective of their right to bear arms. We've looked into some of the numbers behind firearms in the US. There have been more than 488 mass shootings across the US so far in 2024,according to the Gun Violence Archive,external, which defines a mass shooting as an incident in which four or more people are injured or killed. Their figures include shootings that happen in homes and in public places. For each of the last four years there have been more than 600 mass shootings - almost two a day on average. He counts US shootings. He no longer remembers names The deadliest such attack, in Las Vegas in 2017, killed more than 50 people and left 500 wounded. The vast majority of mass shootings, however, leave fewer than 10 people dead. 48,830 people died from gun-related injuries in the US during 2021, according to data fromthe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),external. That was nearly an 8% increase from 2020, which was a record-breaking year for firearm deaths. While mass shootings and gun murders (homicides) generally garner much media attention, more than half of the total in 2021 were suicides. That year, more than 20,000 of the deaths were homicides,according to the CDC,external. Data shows more than 50 people are killed each day by a firearm in the US. That's a significantly larger proportion of homicides than is the case in Canada, Australia, England and Wales, and many other countries. While calculating the number of guns in private hands around the world is difficult, the latest figures from the Small Arms Survey - a Swiss-based research project - estimated that there were 390 million guns in circulation in the US in 2018. The US ratio of 120.5 firearms per 100 residents, up from 88 per 100 in 2011, far surpasses that of other countries around the world. Data from the US has suggested that gun ownership has grown significantly in recent years. A study, published bythe Annals of Internal Medicine in 2021,external, found that 7.5 million US adults became new gun owners between January 2019 and April 2021. That, in turn, exposed 11 million people to firearms in their homes, including 5 million children. About half of new gun owners in that time period were women, while 40% were either black or Hispanic. A majority of Americans are in favour of gun control. 57% of Americans surveyed said they wanted stricter gun lawsaccording to polling by Gallup,externalin November 2022. 32% said the laws should remain the same, while 10% of people surveyed said they should be ""made less strict"". The issue is extremely divisive, falling largely along party lines. ""Democrats are nearly unanimous in their support for stricter gun laws,""another Gallup study noted,externalin 2021, with nearly 91% in favour of stricter gun laws. Only 24% Republicans, on the other hand, agreed with the same statement, along with 45% of Independent voters. Some states have taken steps to ban or strictly regulate ownership of assault weapons. Laws vary by state but California, for example, has banned ownership of assault weapons with limited exceptions. Some controls are widely supported by people across the political divide - such as restrictions governing the sale of guns to people who are mentally ill or on ""watch"" lists. Despite years of financial woes and internal strife, the National Rifle Association (NRA) remains the most powerful gun lobby in the United States, with a substantial budget to influence members of Congress on gun policy. Over the last several election cycles, it, and other organisations, have consistently spent more on pro-gun rights messaging than their rivals in the gun control lobby. A number of states have also gone as far as to largely eliminate restrictions on who can carry a gun. In June 2021, for example, Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed into law a ""permitless carry bill"" that allows the state's residents to carry handguns without a licence or training. Similarly, in 2022, Georgia became the 25th in the nation to eliminate the need for a permit to conceal or openly carry a firearm. The law means any citizen of that state has the right to carry a firearm without a licence or a permit. The law was backed by the NRA, and leaders within the organisation called the move ""a monumental moment for the Second Amendment"". He counts US shootings.

"This video can not be played Meghan reveals her halter-neck evening dress before driving into the sunset Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have become husband and wife in a moving ceremony at Windsor Castle. An emotional-looking prince and his smiling bride exchanged vows and rings before the Queen and 600 guests at St George's Chapel. Ms Markle, wearing a white boat-neck dress by British designer Clare Waight Keller, was walked down the aisle by Prince Charles. At the altar, Prince Harry told her: ""You look amazing."" After the service the couple - who will now be known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex - kissed in front of cheering well-wishers on the steps of the chapel. Thousands of members of the public turned out in bright sunshine to see them driven around Windsor in a horse-drawn carriage. Later, Prince Harry drove the couple to their reception in a 1968 silver blue Jaguar that has been converted to run on electric power, with a registration plate that referenced the date - E190518. This video can not be played Highlights from the wedding ceremony Guests at the wedding included Oprah Winfrey, George and Amal Clooney, David and Victoria Beckham and Sir Elton John, who later performed at the wedding reception. Ms Markle's sculpted dress was designed by Ms Waight Keller for French fashion house Givenchy. Most striking was a diamond bandeau tiara, loaned to her by the Queen, and a trailing five-metre silk veil embroidered with the flowers of each country in the Commonwealth. Prince Harry, 33, and his brother and best man, the Duke of Cambridge, wore the frockcoat uniform of the Blues and Royals. He was given special permission from the Queen to keep his short beard as it is customary to be clean-shaven when dressed in Army uniform. Their 10 young bridesmaids and pageboys - including Prince George and Princess Charlotte - rose to the occasion. However, the excitement became too much for one of the younger ones who started crying just before Ms Markle, 36, entered the chapel. Five moments from the royal wedding Meghan's dress in detail In pictures: The bridesmaids and page boys Viewpoint: 'Landmark' for African Americans Prince Charles walked Ms Markle down the aisle,after her father, Thomas, was unable to attend for health reasons. Mr Markle, 73, reportedly watched the ceremony from California. He told theUS celebrity website, TMZ,external: ""My baby looks beautiful and she looks very happy."" Ms Markle's mother, Doria Ragland, stayed with her daughter overnight before accompanying her to the chapel. Dressed in a pale green Oscar de la Renta dress, with a neat hat, an emotional-looking Ms Ragland sat alone on the bride's side of the chapel for some time. As the witnesses were called to sign the register, Ms Ragland appeared to accept an outstretched hand from Prince Charles with some relief. This video can not be played The couple gazed into each other's eyes as they exchanged vows In her vows, Ms Markle did not promise to ""obey"" her husband, while the prince has broken with royal tradition by choosing to wear a wedding ring. Prince Harry's ring is a platinum band with a textured finish and Ms Markle's has been made from a piece of Welsh gold. The wedding service combined British tradition with modernity and the bride's African-American heritage. The Most Rev Bishop Michael Curry, the president of the US Episcopal Church, gave an address, the Rt Rev David Conner, Dean of Windsor, conducted the service and the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev Justin Welby, officiated. ""There's power, power in love,"" said Bishop Curry, who was invited to speak by Ms Markle. ""If you don't believe me think about a time when you first fell in love. The whole world seemed to centre around you and your beloved."" In a fiery, passionate speech, he also referenced the African-American spiritual song Down by the Riverside, which was sung by slaves, and when he realised he had gone on too long, he told his audience he had better wrap up as ""we gotta get you all married!"" Speaking afterwards, Bishop Curry said it was ""a joyful thing"" to see diversity in the ceremony, adding: ""That happened today, in different ways, different songs, different perspectives, different worlds and all of it came together and gave God thanks."" In pictures: Pomp and ceremony in Windsor In pictures: The A-list guests Lady Jane Fellowes, the sister of Prince Harry's late mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, gave a reading from the Song of Solomon. Karen Gibson and The Kingdom Choir performed Ben E King's soul classic Stand By Me during the service.

He was accompanied by musicians from the BBC National Orchestra of Wales, the English Chamber Orchestra and the Philharmonia. The gospel choir also performed Etta James' uplifting version of Amen/This Little Light of Mine as the newlyweds left the chapel. Prince Charles accompanied Ms Markle's mother, Doria, after the service finished After the service, the duke and duchess travelled through Windsor along a route lined by tens of thousands of well-wishers. The Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead said more than 100,000 people visited the town on Saturday. It was a traditional wedding - the dress, the bridesmaids, the vows, the hymns. And it was very, very different. The Palace made it clear in a stream of announcements that they wanted a different kind of wedding. But it was the service that marked this out as a modern, diverse wedding for a modern, diverse couple: the Kingdom Gospel choir setting toes tapping, a young black cellist, and a breathtaking address from Bishop Curry, the President of the Episcopal Church. Every royal wedding is a chance for the Royal Family to relaunch and reinvent. There may have been trouble in the week before the wedding. But that is in the past. This wedding was about the future, a different future for the Royal Family. Read more from Jonny Dymond Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"This video can not be played Highlights: Eden Hazard's first-half penalty helps Chelsea beat Man Utd to win FA Cup Eden Hazard's first-half penalty decided the FA Cup final in Chelsea's favour at Wembley to leave Jose Mourinho and Manchester United empty-handed this season. Hazard - in a moment which did not bode well for the World Cup meeting between England and Belgium in Russia in June - twisted and tore past Phil Jones before drawing a clumsy foul from the United defender after 22 minutes. He calmly dispatched the penalty which was to prove to be the decisive moment in a final that was hard fought rather than distinguished. United, with striker Romelu Lukaku only fit enough for a place on the bench, raised their game after the break. Alexis Sanchez had a goal ruled out for straying just offside, with referee Michael Oliver using the video assistant referee (VAR) to confirm the call, Chelsea keeper Thibaut Courtois excelled with a succession of fine saves, and Paul Pogba wasted their best chance late on when he missed the target with a free header. This may well be Antonio Conte's last game as Blues manager and if he leaves, he does so after delivering the FA Cup to follow last season's Premier League title. If it is to be goodbye for Conte, his team delivered the famous old trophy in a manner that has become the Italian's trademark. His side grabbed the initiative to take advantage of United's tentative first 45 minutes, securing a precious lead that they defended with great resilience and organisation for the rest of an attritional final. And it was a tribute to Conte that he inspired this performance following a flat end to their Premier League campaign, when a home draw with Huddersfield and a lame defeat at Newcastle left them fifth, out of the Champions League qualification spots. This has been a season in sharp contrast to Conte's title-winning campaign. The 48-year-old has appeared at odds with the club's hierarchy, often detached and not quite the driven figure who arrived at Stamford Bridge in the summer of 2016. And yet he has delivered silverware, which has escaped Mourinho and Mauricio Pochettino at Tottenham this season - although the failure to finish in the top four is painful and likely to be the point at which Conte and Chelsea part company. One fact is beyond dispute. The manager remains a hugely popular figure with Chelsea's supporters as they chanted his name. If he is leaving, he has given them another happy memory. 'I am committed to this club but I can't change' - Chelsea boss Conte The sight of thousands of empty seats as Manchester United's players went up to receive their losers' medals summed up a bitterly disappointing day for Mourinho and his side. United's Premier League points tally of 81 was very respectable but it was still 19 behind champions Manchester City and this loss leaves a taste of anti-climax to their season. They deserve credit for finishing second and reaching the FA Cup final but too often the style of play has been stodgy and even the resilience United have demonstrated this season could not spark a recover at Wembley. As United stumbled through the first half, they will have been desperately hoping they could dig deep in the fashion that saw them beat Spurs here in the semi-final. It was not to be, despite an improved second-half performance. United were thwarted by Courtois when they did break through, but this was a day when Mourinho and many of his players came up short. Mourinho will feel the failure to win a trophy as acutely as anyone - especially as it came against the club where he enjoyed so much success. Now he must act to add an extra touch of stardust to this United team as they are functional rather than exciting, as proved in this final. The big games are often decided by the big players and this is exactly why Chelsea were able to close out this win and salvage success from a season of underachievement. And, in contrast, so many of those Mourinho and Manchester United would have been counting on to make the difference did not make the expected contribution. N'Golo Kante was magnificent in midfield - tireless and effective, a superb defensive buffer when United did finally exert pressure, while keeper Courtois was also outstanding. In defence, Antonio Rudiger was a rock and Gary Cahill delivered a performance that was a timely reminder of why England manager Gareth Southgate included him in his World Cup squad. Match-winner Hazard was always a threat and Southgate might have had an ominous feeling as he watched him go past Jones before drawing a clumsy foul from the man he may face when England meet Belgium in Russia next month. For United, Jones had a nightmare, Sanchez was truly dismal and Pogba only raised a gallop after half-time. The Frenchman also missed arguably their best chance when he headed wide at a corner when unmarked and only eight yards out. For all Mourinho's complaints about injustice, a clear penalty decided the fate of this final. Listen: 5 live Football Daily podcast This video can not be played Hazard penalty puts Chelsea ahead in FA Cup final There was plenty of debate on social media after Oliver's decision to show a yellow card to Jones for conceding the spot-kick. The referee's decision was dictated by a law change in 2016 intended to abolish ""triple punishment"" in such circumstances. Before the change, any denial of a clear goalscoring opportunity inside the area resulted in the offender receiving a red card and a suspension, as well as conceding a penalty. Under the amended Law 12, which relates to fouls and misconduct, a player judged to have made a genuine attempt to win the ball is shown a yellow card instead. The law states:,external""Where a player commits an offence against an opponent within their own penalty area which denies an opponent an obvious goalscoring opportunity and the referee awards a penalty kick, the offending player is cautioned if the offence was an attempt to play the ball. ""In all other circumstances (e.g. holding, pulling, pushing, no possibility to play the ball etc.) the offending player must be sent off."" The Chelsea midfielder made six tackles during the final - more than any other player on the pitch Chelsea boss Antonio Conte:""I'm very satisfied because today was very difficult. ""To win the FA Cup against a really strong team - a really great team like Manchester United - we must be pleased. ""It wasn't easy, but I'm very happy for our fans, for my players. ""I predicted at the start of the season the difficulty of this season. Despite this we finished fifth and have won the FA Cup. ""To miss a place in Champions League is not good. We must be honest to say this - but at the same time I think you have to know the real situation, to understand if this group of players did their best this season. ""An important trophy like this shows the great commitment of my players. It showed great desire to finish the season in the right way despite the great difficulty we have had."" This video can not be played FA Cup: I'll respect Chelsea's decision on my future - Antonio Conte Manchester United boss Jose Mourinho:""Every defeat hurts, but for me personally the ones that hurt less are when you give everything and you go without any regrets. ""I prefer to lose like today than lose like we did at, for example, Newcastle. I leave my players happy with them. For me, that's really important. ""I knew the opponent I was going to play against. I knew they have a compact low block with lots of physicality where they try to close everything. ""I knew without a target man it would be difficult for us."" This video can not be played Manchester United were the best team - Jose Mourinho Mourinho has lost his first cup final in charge of an English club, after winning each of the previous six (four League Cups, one FA Cup, one Europa League). Chelsea won their eighth FA Cup, taking them level with Tottenham - only Manchester United (12) and Arsenal (13) have won more. Seven of the past 10 FA Cup winners have been London clubs (Chelsea winning four, Arsenal three). Conte won a domestic cup final for the first time as a manager, after losing with Juventus against Napoli in the 2012 Coppa Italia, and the 2017 FA Cup with Chelsea against Arsenal. United's have won only one of their past four FA Cup final appearances. Mourinho's side had 18 shots in the game; they last attempted more shots without scoring in a match in October 2016 (38 in a 0-0 Premier League draw against Burnley). Hazard's penalty was the first scored in an FA Cup final (excluding shootouts) since Ruud van Nistelrooy for Manchester United against Millwall in 2004.

"Passengers have been urged to plan ahead and check revised timetables A rail timetable overhaul billed as the biggest in the UK has begun - but it may leave some users behind. Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) is rescheduling every train in its franchise, which includes Southern, Thameslink and Great Northern services. But passengers in a number of smaller locations complain they will be served with fewer or slower services. And the RMT union claims passengers with reduced mobility may be left behind if a train is at risk of delay. GTR said it placed high priority on making its services accessible to all. From Sunday every schedule for Thameslink, Southern, Gatwick Express and Great Northern trains will be different in an attempt to improve rail efficiency in the South East. It will mean 400 extra trains a day and new direct services from 80 stations into central London. Travel journalist Simon Calder said the overhaul would benefit some passengers, such as those travelling from Brighton to London where some rush hour services will be 15 minutes faster. But he said those journey times are faster because they miss out stops, adding: ""If you're one of the people who's waiting on the platform when the train goes through at 90 miles an hour instead of stopping - you're going to be a bit miffed."" And there appear to have been some teething problems,with cancellations and delays on trains run by Great Northern, Southern and Thameslink. GTR told the BBC that, ""as part of the huge logistical challenge of introducing this new timetable, some services are not initially running. We are working hard to minimise the impact this will have on our busiest trains. This situation will improve."" On Great Northern the new timetable has been scrapped and a short-term one is in place. New train timetable suspended on day one 'Disbelief and discontent' over timetable delays Network Rail puts new projects on hold Commuters 'priced off' UK trains - union GTR has for weeks reminded passengers to plan ahead, check revised timetables and expect their usual services to run at new times. The train operator does still anticipate delays and minor issues with services as staff and commuters adjust and trains and crew are redeployed. It has called the shake-up ""the biggest-ever change to rail timetables to significantly boost capacity on the UK's most congested network"". Ahead of the new timetable, the RMT said GTR staff had been given the instructions ""Do not attempt to place PRM [Persons of Reduced Mobility] on train if there is a possibility of delaying the service"" in a booklet outlining strategies for managing the time trains spend stopped at a station. 'I was stranded on a train in a wheelchair' RMT general secretary Mick Cash said: ""I cannot believe in this day and age we are telling staff to ignore the needs of disabled people if the time it will take to deploy a ramp and assist them onto the train will cause a delay."" Although the rail company did not deny the existence of such instructions, it said: "" Our policy remains the same which is to offer assistance to all passengers to help them with their journeys. ""We have a responsibility to make sure each service leaves on time to avoid knock-on delays, skipped station stops and cancellations to other services which would affect thousands of other passengers, many of whom may also be disabled,"" a GTR spokesperson said. Southern Rail services into London Bridge will have new timetables from Sunday The timetable changes mean some of the services will be faster and more frequent, while those that that typically suffer chronic delays will be deliberately slowed down to make arrival times more realistic. GTR is the largest rail franchise in the UK and its commuter services call into London stations such as St Pancras, London Bridge and London Victoria. It has said the schedule revamp will mean some services to and from commuter towns will be reduced, although total network capacity will increase. Emily Ketchin, founder of the campaign group Harpenden Thameslink Commuters' Group, says she and others commuting between Harpenden, Hertfordshire, and London, will be adversely affected. ""We are actually losing a third of key services in the morning, and also getting longer journey times, in the morning and in the evening,"" she told BBC Radio Five live. ""We currently have nine fast services and that is going down to six and it is totally unacceptable.  Even before these cuts it was a very overcrowded service. ""It is very difficult to get on a train and it is going to get a lot worse. And we pay Â£4,000 a year for that service."" Train company GTR said Harpenden services were being temporarily reduced because of upgrade works on the neighbouring Midland Mainline, which is being electrified from Bedford to Kettering and Corby. It said that planned extra train seats for Harpenden commuters would not now come into effect until 2020, when the route modernisation programme north of Bedford was completed.

"This video can not be played Princess Charlotte and Prince George arrive at the royal wedding Six bridesmaids and four pageboys played a major supporting role as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle tied the knot. Prince George and Princess Charlotte - Prince Harry's niece and nephew - were among the children, all aged between two and seven, under the spotlight of the world's media at St George's Chapel, Windsor. Princess Charlotte was joined as a bridesmaid by Prince Harry's god-daughters - Zalie Warren, two, and three-year-old Florence van Cutsem - and Meghan's Markle's goddaughters. Sisters Remi and Rylan Litt, aged six and seven respectively, and four-year-old Ivy Mulroney are the daughters of Ms Markle's friends Benita Litt and Jessica Mulroney. As a pageboy, Prince George wore a miniature version of the Blues and Royals frockcoats worn by Prince Harry and his brother and best man Prince William. The other pageboys were seven-year-old twins John and Brian Mulroney and Jasper Dyer, six, another of Prince Harry's godsons. The Duchess of Cambridge arrived with Prince George (l), Jasper Dyer, Princess Charlotte (r) and Florence van Cutsem. The bridesmaids had to be given a helping hand as they walked up the steps of St George's Chapel. Princess Charlotte turned to give a wave. The designer of the wedding dress, Clare Waight Keller, was also behind the bridesmaids' dresses. Made of ivory silk radzimir, the high-waisted outfits with short puff sleeves and pleated skirt were hand finished with a double silk ribbon detail tied at the back in a bow. The girls also wore a flower crown chosen by Prince Harry and Meghan, which replicated the blooms used in the bridal bouquet. Pageboys John and Brian Mulroney accompanied Meghan Markle on the journey from her hotel to Windsor in a vintage Rolls-Royce. Meghan's pageboys and Toronto 'royalty' They held the train of Ms Markle's dress as she walked up the steps of St George's Chapel. Just before Ms Markle arrived, the Duchess of Cambridge helped coax the children into position.  They were handed flowers, ready for their big moment. And they walked back down the aisle with the newlyweds at the end of the service. A wave goodbye from Princess Charlotte after the service as the new Duke and Duchess of Sussex boarded a horse-drawn landau for the procession in front of cheering crowds.

"This video can not be played The plane came down in a field near Havana's main airport Cuban officials say they have found one of the two black boxes from a plane that crashed near Havana airport, killing more than 100 people, in ""good condition"". Transport Minister Adel Yzquierdo says he hopes the second device will be recovered soon. He revised the official death toll up to 110 people, including 11 foreigners. Three women survived the crash, but are said to be in a critical condition with serious burns. The incident is Cuba's worst air disaster in decades, and two days of national mourning began on Saturday. Officials said investigators are combing through the wreckage of the plane, a Boeing 737 which was nearly 40 years old, at the field where it crashed some 20km (12 miles) south of the Cuban capital. The black box which has already been recovered will hold key flight data and information about what happened to the plane. Cuba country profile Major air disasters timeline Mr Yzquierdo told journalists that the 110 dead included 99 Cubans, six Mexican crew members, two tourists from Argentina, one from Mexico, and two passengers from Western Sahara. The Argentine couple were named by their government as Dora Beatriz Cifuentes and Oscar Hugo Almaras, both in their sixties. Several victims' relatives have travelled to Havana to help identify the deceased. The first secretary of Communist Party in HolguÃ­n comforts relatives of the crash victims Those coming from HolguÃ­n - the plane's intended destination - and other eastern parts of Cuba made the 700km (435-mile) trip on buses, escorted by the National Revolutionary Police, EFE news agency reported. President Miguel Diaz-Canel has visited the morgue where the victims are being identified. Cuban authorities do not plan to release the full list of the dead until all victims' families have been informed. The Boeing 737-201 crashed at 12:08 (16:08 GMT) on Friday, shortly after taking off from Havana on an internal flight to HolguÃ­n. It's too early to say what caused the crash, but eyewitnesses on the ground described seeing the jet burst into flames before crashing into a field close to a wooded area near the airport. Wreckage was spread over a large area ""I saw it taking off,"" supermarket worker Jose Luis told the AFP news agency. ""All of a sudden, it made a turn, and went down. We were all amazed."" ""We heard an explosion and then saw a big cloud of smoke go up,"" Gilberto Menendez, who runs a restaurant near the crash site, told Reuters. Mexico's transport department said on its website that ""during take-off (the plane) apparently suffered a problem and dived to the ground"". Boeing said that it was ready to send a technical team to Cuba, ""as permitted under US law and at the direction of the US National Transportation Safety Board and Cuban authorities"". A US trade embargo has been in force against Cuba for many decades. Four people initially survived the crash but one died after being taken to hospital, the director of Havana's Calixto Garcia hospital, Carlos Alberto Martinez, told Reuters. The three survivors are all women, according to Cuban Communist Party newspaper Granma: one aged between 18 and 25, one in her thirties and the third aged 39. A survivor of the plane crash attended by emergency workers ""She is alive but very burnt and swollen,"" one of the women's relatives at the hospital told Reuters. By Will Grant, BBC Cuba Correspondent Two days of national mourning have begun, with the entire island sharing a little of the pain of the many families affected by the disaster. But in their grief, people also want answers. They are demanding an explanation as to why a routine flight from Havana came crashing down in a field barely a minute after it took off, with over 100 passengers and crew on board. The country's new President, Miguel Diaz-Canel, faces his first real test in providing those answers. He visited the crash site to thank the emergency services and announced an investigation was already under way. Flags are flying at half-mast in Cuba as the island grieves the disaster It emerged that the previous President, RaÃºl Castro, was recuperating from minor surgery on a hernia, and he too expressed his condolences to the victims' families. The families of the survivors face an anxious wait to see if they will pull through, and their countrymen are praying that at least some will have survived this catastrophe. The plane had been leased to state airline Cubana de AviaciÃ³n by the Mexican company Aerolineas Damojh. The Mexican authorities said the plane was built in 1979 and had been successfully inspected last November. Mexico earlier said it was sending two civil aviation specialists to join the investigation. Aerolineas Damojh, also known as Global Air, has three planes in operation. Crowds of shocked onlookers gathered at the crash site According to industry research,last year was the safest in history for commercial airline travelwith no passenger jet crashes. But there have been several serious air disasters this year. Last month, a military plane crashed shortly after take-off in Algeria, killing more than 250 people In February, a Saratov Airlines plane crashed near Moscow, killing 71 people In March, a US-Bangla Airlines flight crashed in Kathmandu, Nepal; 51 people died Cuba's deadliest air crash was in 1989, when a Soviet-made Ilyushin-62M passenger plane crashed near Havana, killing 126 people on board and another 24 people on the ground.

"This video can not be played Highlights: Eden Hazard's first-half penalty helps Chelsea beat Man Utd to win FA Cup Eden Hazard's first-half penalty decided the FA Cup final in Chelsea's favour at Wembley to leave Jose Mourinho and Manchester United empty-handed this season. Hazard - in a moment which did not bode well for the World Cup meeting between England and Belgium in Russia in June - twisted and tore past Phil Jones before drawing a clumsy foul from the United defender after 22 minutes. He calmly dispatched the penalty which was to prove to be the decisive moment in a final that was hard fought rather than distinguished. United, with striker Romelu Lukaku only fit enough for a place on the bench, raised their game after the break. Alexis Sanchez had a goal ruled out for straying just offside, with referee Michael Oliver using the video assistant referee (VAR) to confirm the call, Chelsea keeper Thibaut Courtois excelled with a succession of fine saves, and Paul Pogba wasted their best chance late on when he missed the target with a free header. This may well be Antonio Conte's last game as Blues manager and if he leaves, he does so after delivering the FA Cup to follow last season's Premier League title. If it is to be goodbye for Conte, his team delivered the famous old trophy in a manner that has become the Italian's trademark. His side grabbed the initiative to take advantage of United's tentative first 45 minutes, securing a precious lead that they defended with great resilience and organisation for the rest of an attritional final. And it was a tribute to Conte that he inspired this performance following a flat end to their Premier League campaign, when a home draw with Huddersfield and a lame defeat at Newcastle left them fifth, out of the Champions League qualification spots. This has been a season in sharp contrast to Conte's title-winning campaign. The 48-year-old has appeared at odds with the club's hierarchy, often detached and not quite the driven figure who arrived at Stamford Bridge in the summer of 2016. And yet he has delivered silverware, which has escaped Mourinho and Mauricio Pochettino at Tottenham this season - although the failure to finish in the top four is painful and likely to be the point at which Conte and Chelsea part company. One fact is beyond dispute. The manager remains a hugely popular figure with Chelsea's supporters as they chanted his name. If he is leaving, he has given them another happy memory. 'I am committed to this club but I can't change' - Chelsea boss Conte The sight of thousands of empty seats as Manchester United's players went up to receive their losers' medals summed up a bitterly disappointing day for Mourinho and his side. United's Premier League points tally of 81 was very respectable but it was still 19 behind champions Manchester City and this loss leaves a taste of anti-climax to their season. They deserve credit for finishing second and reaching the FA Cup final but too often the style of play has been stodgy and even the resilience United have demonstrated this season could not spark a recover at Wembley. As United stumbled through the first half, they will have been desperately hoping they could dig deep in the fashion that saw them beat Spurs here in the semi-final. It was not to be, despite an improved second-half performance. United were thwarted by Courtois when they did break through, but this was a day when Mourinho and many of his players came up short. Mourinho will feel the failure to win a trophy as acutely as anyone - especially as it came against the club where he enjoyed so much success. Now he must act to add an extra touch of stardust to this United team as they are functional rather than exciting, as proved in this final. The big games are often decided by the big players and this is exactly why Chelsea were able to close out this win and salvage success from a season of underachievement. And, in contrast, so many of those Mourinho and Manchester United would have been counting on to make the difference did not make the expected contribution. N'Golo Kante was magnificent in midfield - tireless and effective, a superb defensive buffer when United did finally exert pressure, while keeper Courtois was also outstanding. In defence, Antonio Rudiger was a rock and Gary Cahill delivered a performance that was a timely reminder of why England manager Gareth Southgate included him in his World Cup squad. Match-winner Hazard was always a threat and Southgate might have had an ominous feeling as he watched him go past Jones before drawing a clumsy foul from the man he may face when England meet Belgium in Russia next month. For United, Jones had a nightmare, Sanchez was truly dismal and Pogba only raised a gallop after half-time. The Frenchman also missed arguably their best chance when he headed wide at a corner when unmarked and only eight yards out. For all Mourinho's complaints about injustice, a clear penalty decided the fate of this final. Listen: 5 live Football Daily podcast This video can not be played Hazard penalty puts Chelsea ahead in FA Cup final There was plenty of debate on social media after Oliver's decision to show a yellow card to Jones for conceding the spot-kick. The referee's decision was dictated by a law change in 2016 intended to abolish ""triple punishment"" in such circumstances. Before the change, any denial of a clear goalscoring opportunity inside the area resulted in the offender receiving a red card and a suspension, as well as conceding a penalty. Under the amended Law 12, which relates to fouls and misconduct, a player judged to have made a genuine attempt to win the ball is shown a yellow card instead. The law states:,external""Where a player commits an offence against an opponent within their own penalty area which denies an opponent an obvious goalscoring opportunity and the referee awards a penalty kick, the offending player is cautioned if the offence was an attempt to play the ball.

This video can not be played Manchester United were the best team - Jose Mourinho Mourinho has lost his first cup final in charge of an English club, after winning each of the previous six (four League Cups, one FA Cup, one Europa League). Chelsea won their eighth FA Cup, taking them level with Tottenham - only Manchester United (12) and Arsenal (13) have won more. Seven of the past 10 FA Cup winners have been London clubs (Chelsea winning four, Arsenal three). Conte won a domestic cup final for the first time as a manager, after losing with Juventus against Napoli in the 2012 Coppa Italia, and the 2017 FA Cup with Chelsea against Arsenal. United's have won only one of their past four FA Cup final appearances. Mourinho's side had 18 shots in the game; they last attempted more shots without scoring in a match in October 2016 (38 in a 0-0 Premier League draw against Burnley). Hazard's penalty was the first scored in an FA Cup final (excluding shootouts) since Ruud van Nistelrooy for Manchester United against Millwall in 2004.

"Passengers have been urged to plan ahead and check revised timetables A rail timetable overhaul billed as the biggest in the UK has begun - but it may leave some users behind. Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) is rescheduling every train in its franchise, which includes Southern, Thameslink and Great Northern services. But passengers in a number of smaller locations complain they will be served with fewer or slower services. And the RMT union claims passengers with reduced mobility may be left behind if a train is at risk of delay. GTR said it placed high priority on making its services accessible to all. From Sunday every schedule for Thameslink, Southern, Gatwick Express and Great Northern trains will be different in an attempt to improve rail efficiency in the South East. It will mean 400 extra trains a day and new direct services from 80 stations into central London. Travel journalist Simon Calder said the overhaul would benefit some passengers, such as those travelling from Brighton to London where some rush hour services will be 15 minutes faster. But he said those journey times are faster because they miss out stops, adding: ""If you're one of the people who's waiting on the platform when the train goes through at 90 miles an hour instead of stopping - you're going to be a bit miffed."" And there appear to have been some teething problems,with cancellations and delays on trains run by Great Northern, Southern and Thameslink. GTR told the BBC that, ""as part of the huge logistical challenge of introducing this new timetable, some services are not initially running. We are working hard to minimise the impact this will have on our busiest trains. This situation will improve."" On Great Northern the new timetable has been scrapped and a short-term one is in place. New train timetable suspended on day one 'Disbelief and discontent' over timetable delays Network Rail puts new projects on hold Commuters 'priced off' UK trains - union GTR has for weeks reminded passengers to plan ahead, check revised timetables and expect their usual services to run at new times. The train operator does still anticipate delays and minor issues with services as staff and commuters adjust and trains and crew are redeployed. It has called the shake-up ""the biggest-ever change to rail timetables to significantly boost capacity on the UK's most congested network"". Ahead of the new timetable, the RMT said GTR staff had been given the instructions ""Do not attempt to place PRM [Persons of Reduced Mobility] on train if there is a possibility of delaying the service"" in a booklet outlining strategies for managing the time trains spend stopped at a station. 'I was stranded on a train in a wheelchair' RMT general secretary Mick Cash said: ""I cannot believe in this day and age we are telling staff to ignore the needs of disabled people if the time it will take to deploy a ramp and assist them onto the train will cause a delay."" Although the rail company did not deny the existence of such instructions, it said: "" Our policy remains the same which is to offer assistance to all passengers to help them with their journeys. ""We have a responsibility to make sure each service leaves on time to avoid knock-on delays, skipped station stops and cancellations to other services which would affect thousands of other passengers, many of whom may also be disabled,"" a GTR spokesperson said. Southern Rail services into London Bridge will have new timetables from Sunday The timetable changes mean some of the services will be faster and more frequent, while those that that typically suffer chronic delays will be deliberately slowed down to make arrival times more realistic. GTR is the largest rail franchise in the UK and its commuter services call into London stations such as St Pancras, London Bridge and London Victoria. It has said the schedule revamp will mean some services to and from commuter towns will be reduced, although total network capacity will increase. Emily Ketchin, founder of the campaign group Harpenden Thameslink Commuters' Group, says she and others commuting between Harpenden, Hertfordshire, and London, will be adversely affected. ""We are actually losing a third of key services in the morning, and also getting longer journey times, in the morning and in the evening,"" she told BBC Radio Five live. ""We currently have nine fast services and that is going down to six and it is totally unacceptable.  Even before these cuts it was a very overcrowded service. ""It is very difficult to get on a train and it is going to get a lot worse. And we pay Â£4,000 a year for that service."" Train company GTR said Harpenden services were being temporarily reduced because of upgrade works on the neighbouring Midland Mainline, which is being electrified from Bedford to Kettering and Corby. It said that planned extra train seats for Harpenden commuters would not now come into effect until 2020, when the route modernisation programme north of Bedford was completed.

"Janet Daby was chosen from a shortlist made up of only black and ethnic minority women Members of the Labour Party have selected Janet Daby to stand in the Lewisham East by-election. Ms Daby was chosen after hustings in south-east London on Saturday froma shortlist made up of only black and ethnic minority women. She beat Sakina Sheikh and Claudia Webbe to run as the party's candidate for the by-election on 14 June. Brenda Dacres pulled out of the contest on Friday because of health reasons. Ms Daby said it was an ""honour"" to be put forward to run for Parliament. Jeremy Corbyn congratulated Ms Daby and said she would make a ""great advocate"" for people in Lewisham. Heidi Alexander is Sadiq Khan's new deputy mayor for transport The by-election was sparked by the resignation of Heidi Alexander, who is going to work for London Mayor Sadiq Khan. Ms Alexander won the south-east London constituency by more than 21,000 votes in last year's general election, with the Conservatives second and Liberal Democrats third. She is to become London's new deputy mayor for transport. Janet Daby's selection will be seen as a boost for the Labour Party's centrists. Her views on Brexit put her at odds with party leader Jeremy Corbyn. He has ruled out remaining in the single market - but Ms Daby was cheered by Labour members as she told them she was ""pro-EU"" and wanted to ""stay in the single market and customs union"". Heidi Alexander claimed Jeremy Corbyn's shadow cabinet was dysfunctional when she quit it. So there had been speculation that she might be replaced with a more left-wing candidate. But Sakina Sheikh, who was backed by Momentum and is thought to be a favourite of Corbyn's, along with Claudia Webbe - who had the support of several unions - both lost by a long way. Ms Daby received more than 60% of the vote.
