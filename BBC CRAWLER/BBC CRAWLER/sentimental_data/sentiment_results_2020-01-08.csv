"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will not return as working members of the Royal Family, Buckingham Palace has said. The couple said last year that they would step back as ""senior"" royals, and work to become financially independent. In 2016, Kensington Palace released a statement confirming Harry had been dating US actress Meghan Markle ""for a few months"". They were pictured in public for the first time in Toronto, attending a wheelchair tennis match during the 2017 Invictus Games. They announced their engagement a few weeks after being first pictured together. Meghan told BBC News that Harry's proposal was ""just an amazing surprise, it was so sweet and natural and very romantic"". In February 2018, the couple took part in their first joint engagement with Prince Harry's brother and sister-in-law, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. As Meghan joined their Royal Foundation charity, Harry joked the foursome were now ""stuck together"". The couple were married at Windsor Castle, on 19 May 2018, with 1,200 public invitations to the grounds of the castle. They travelled through the town in a horse-drawn carriage. Up to 100,000 well-wishers lined the route as the duke and duchess travelled through Windsor. The couple exchanged vows and rings before the Queen and 600 guests at St George's Chapel. The couple kissed on the steps of St George's Chapel. The Queen, Duke of Edinburgh and other members of the Royal Family attended the wedding. The newlyweds held hands after the ceremony. In June 2018, the Queen and the duchess were seen at their first royal engagement together, as they officially opened the Mersey Gateway Bridge and Chester's Storyhouse Theatre. That autumn, Kensington Palace revealed the duchess was pregnant and the couple's baby was due in the spring. Shortly after the announcement, they embarked on their first official overseas tour, visiting Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga. On one of their engagements, the couple posed with OneWave, a surfing community group that raises awareness of mental health and wellbeing, at Bondi Beach, in Sydney, Australia On 6 May, 2019, Meghan gave birth to a boy, Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, who became seventh in line to the throne. Harry told reporters: ""It's been the most amazing experience I could ever possibly imagine"". In June 2019, the couple announced they were splitting from the charity they shared with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, to set up their own foundation. Last autumn, Archie travelled with the couple to southern Africa on their first royal tour as a family, and was a big hit with Archbishop Desmond Tutu. An image of a beaming Prince Harry holding his son while on an extended stay in Canada was released by the couple as part of an Instagram compilation summing up their year. Following their trip, the couple were pictured in January on a visit to Canada House. In February, the couple announced that they are expecting their second child.

"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are stepping back from royal duties and will divide their time between the UK and North America, Buckingham Palace has announced. They will no longer use their HRH titles and will stop receiving public funds for royal duties under the ""new arrangement"". The couple, who have a baby son, Archie, had previously said they planned to carve out a ""progressive new role"" in the Royal Family and intended to ""work to become financially independent"". Following the announcement from the Queen, a separate statement from Buckingham Palace said the couple were grateful to the monarch and the Royal Family for their support as they ""embark on the next chapter of their lives"". It said they understood they are ""required to step back from royal duties, including official military appointments"". The couple will continue to maintain their private patronages and associations ""with the Queen's blessing"", the statement said. Prince Harry and Meghan said previously they plan to launch a new ""charitable entity"". Exactly where and exactly what are unclear as the couple have not yet elaborated on how they see their new role. However, their new charity is expected to be global in reach, with some of the focus likely to be on the US and Africa. On the pair's first official overseas tour last year with their son, Archie, the Duchess of Sussex told teenage girls in a deprived part of South Africa that she was with them""as a woman of colour and as your sister"". Prince Harry has spoken ofhis personal love for Africa, describing the continent as a place ""where I feel more like myself than anywhere else in the world"". The couple's charity work is also likely to have a commitment to female empowerment, an issue on whichMeghan has publicly pledged to ""shine a light"". The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will not receive public funds for royal duties. They have said their ambition is to ""work to become financially independent"". This video can not be played ""Nothing like this has ever happened before"" â royal correspondent Daniela Relph explains David McClure, author of a book on how royals have made and spent their wealth, said they already have their own money and could make more from TV in future. Meghan was reportedly paid $50,000 (Â£38,400) per episode of the TV show Suits. While she is no longer a working actress she will receive some payments whenever the show is rebroadcast. Currently, the duke and duchess's expenses - such as living costs, travel, clothing - are covered by Harry's father for their role as working royals, representing the Queen. The Prince of Wales funds his sons and their families with income from the Duchy of Cornwall. Queen's statement on Harry and Meghan in full Harry and Meghan to step back as senior royals Where do the couple get their money? Historian and royal author Hugo Vickers previously told the BBC he was unconvinced by the couple's plans. He said: ""They think they can do all sorts of things together but the fact is that they're very likely, if they're not careful, to end up as slightly tarnished celebrities, perhaps"". They plan to divide their time between the UK and North America, but BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell said: ""It is expected that they will spend the majority of their time in North America now."" They only moved into their new home - Frogmore Cottage in Windsor, Berkshire - last April ahead of the birth of their son. The estimated cost to the taxpayer of renovations to it is about Â£2.4m. Buckingham Palace said in a statement the couple have ""shared their wish to repay Sovereign Grant expenditure"" for the refurbishment of Frogmore Cottage. It will remain their UK family home, the palace added. Ben and Jessica Mulroney, pictured in 2009 Harry and Meghan took an extended break from royal duties over Christmas, including time spent in the Canadian province of British Columbia. While acting in the US drama Suits, Toronto became an adopted city for Meghan. It is home to her friends, Jessica and Ben Mulroney, the city's ""most polished power couple"", according to Toronto Life magazine. It is likely that the family would spend time in Meghan's US homeland too - her mother, Doria Ragland, lives in California. Her father, Thomas Markle, with whom Meghan has little contact, lives in Mexico. Meghan's mother, Doria Ragland, lives in California Many months of reflection and internal discussions, they said. In October, the public got a glimpse into the couple's mindset in an ITV documentary filmed during a tour of Africa. The Duchess of Sussex admitted adjusting to royal life had been ""hard"" and she had not been prepared for the intensity of the media scrutiny, despite warnings from her British friends that the tabloids could ""destroy"" her life. Asked whether she was coping, Meghan, a new mother, said: ""I have said for a long time to H - that is what I call him - it's not enough to just survive something, that's not the point of life. You have got to thrive."" Prince Harry also described his mental health and the way he deals with the pressures of his life as a matter of ""constant management"". Following their decision to step back as senior royals, BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond said there were ""great chunks"" of the job that the couple ""simply could not stand"", while Harry ""hated the cameras and was visibly bored by the ceremonial"". Towards the end of last year, Prince Harry said he and Meghan were to take legal action against the Mail on Sunday over a claim it unlawfully published one of her private letters. The paper stands by its story. At the time, an unrestrained Harry said: ""I lost my mother and now I watch my wife falling victim to the same powerful forces."" Referring to his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales' sudden death in 1997, he said: ""I've seen what happens when someone I love is commoditised to the point that they are no longer treated or seen as a real person."" In full: Sussexes' statements and palace response This video can not be played Meghan spoke to ITV as part of a documentary last year Speaking at an event on Sunday evening, Prince Harry said he is ""taking a leap of faith"" in stepping back from being a senior royal, adding that""there really was no other option"". The duke insisted he and Meghan had hoped to continue serving the Queen, but without public funding. ""Unfortunately, that wasn't possible,"" he said. In his speech,posted on the couple's Instagram account,external, Prince Harry also spoke of his ""great sadness"" over his and Meghan's new relationship with the Royal Family. ""The decision that I have made for my wife and I to step back is not one I made lightly,"" he said. The BBC's royal correspondent Jonny Dymond said there were ""two big messages"" to take from the speech: including Harry stressing that the move was his call; and that the prince wanted to continue in some sort of royal role. Following the announcement from the Queen that the couple were stepping back from royal duties and can no longer formally represent the Queen, Buckingham Palace said the Sussexes have made clear that everything they do will ""continue to uphold the values of Her Majesty"". While no details have been given about security arrangements for the couple, the statement said ""there are well-established and independent processes to determine the need for publicly-funded security"". The Royal Family faces intense media scrutiny Harry and Meghan had also updatedthe section of their website,externalwhich outlines their attitude to the media. The duke and duchess said they would be adopting a ""revised media approach to ensure diverse and open access of their work"" in 2020. Included in this new strategy, Harry and Meghan said they would ""engage with grassroots media organisations and young, up-and-coming journalists"". They will also pull out of the so-called royal rota system, where journalists and media representatives are given exclusive passes to cover royal engagements on the understanding they share all the material they gather. ""The current system predates the dramatic transformation of news reporting in the digital age,"" the couple said in a statement on their website. Under a heading asking what Harry and Meghan's stance is on the media in general, the couple said they believe in a ""free, strong and open media"" which ""upholds accuracy and fosters inclusivity, diversity and tolerance"". ""Their Royal Highnesses recognise that their roles as members of the Royal Family are subject to interest, and they welcome accurate and honest media reporting as well as being held to account if appropriate. Equally, like every member of society, they also value privacy as individuals and as a family."" The couple said they would continue to use social media, including their Instagram account which has 10.1m followers, to ""personally share moments in their lives directly with members of the public"".

"Veteran Labour MP Barry Gardiner has said he is considering running for the party's leadership. Speaking to the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire, the shadow energy minister said colleagues had told him he could bring ""dynamism to the debate"".

The party's new leader and deputy will be announced on 4 April. Mr Gardiner, who is at a climate change conference in Abu Dhabi, has been MP for Brent North since 1997. He has served in Mr Corbyn's frontbench team since 2016. He said he would run if he believed he had ""the best chance of winning a general election"". Unite union boss Len McCluskey dismissed claims he had approached Mr Gardiner about running because of his concerns about the chances of Mrs Long Bailey, who is regarded as the standard bearer for the left of the party.

"This video can not be played 'I did not escape justice, I fled injustice' The former Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn has said the decision to flee Japan, where he was charged with financial misconduct, was the most difficult of his life. Speaking at a highly anticipated news conference, Mr Ghosn described himself as a ""hostage"" in the country with a choice between dying there or running. He claimed prosecutors had tried to break his spirit by barring any contact with his wife, Carole. He fled to Lebanon on 29 December. The former Nissan and Renault executive told the room packed with journalists from across the globe, that his treatment in Japan failed to meet international standards of justice. In prison, Mr Ghosn said he was kept in a cell with a small window and only allowed to shower twice a week. He also claimed to have spent 130 days in a windowless cell while in solitary confinement. Mr Ghosn said he was interrogated for up to eight hours a day without having any lawyers present and described his ""feeling of hopelessness"" as ""profound"". ""I was brutally taken from my work as I knew it, ripped from my work, my family and my friends,"" he said. Arrest warrant issued for Carlos Ghosn's wife Carlos Ghosn: Renault-Nissan's relentless 'cost killer' How did Carlos Ghosn escape Japan? Carlos Ghosn and Japan's 'hostage justice' system It is the first time Mr Ghosn has spoken publicly since he fled house arrest in Japan. He did not give details of his dramatic escape, despite widespread speculation over how he managed to leave the country undetected and reports that it involved hiding in a musical instrument case. He said providing more information would compromise people who had helped him. Instead he expressed his ""profound appreciation to be able to be reunited with my family and loved ones."" In a statement released after the press conference, prosecutors in Japan said: ""Ghosn's allegations completely ignore his own conduct, and his one-sided criticism of the Japanese criminal justice system is totally unacceptable,"" the statement said. Mr Ghosn ""only has himself to blame for being arrested and detained"" it said. Prosecutors allege that Mr Ghosn made a multi-million-dollar payment to a Nissan distributor in Oman. Nissan, meanwhile, has filed its own criminal complaint against Mr Ghosn, accusing him of diverting money from the company for his own personal enrichment. He is also accused of under-reporting his own salary. Mr Ghosn insists that he is innocent of all charges made against him. It was a bravura performance. Mr Ghosn is no longer the star of the auto industry, but whatever the truth or otherwise of the charges against him, he clearly still knows how to work a room. He railed against the Japanese justice system, which he said violated the basic principles of humanity. He condemned the ""vindictive, inglorious individuals"" he claimed were conspiring against him. He offered a detailed defence to counter the claims Japanese prosecutors have filed against him, and still found time to tear into the way he claims Nissan and Renault are now being mismanaged. We can now expect his arguments to be scrutinised closely - and no doubt both Nissan and the Japanese government will respond. But he has certainly seized the agenda - and combined with his dramatic escape, has done so in style. Mr Ghosn's lawyers had told him it would be five years before he could expect a judgement in the case, he said. He came under pressure to admit to the alleged crimes, he said, to bring the matter to a close. ""'It will get worse for you if you don't just confess,' the prosecutor told me repeatedly,"" he said at the news conference. Reporters have been camped outside the house where Carlos Ghosn is living in Beirut He said the conviction rate in Japan, which is over 99%, had led him to believe he would not get a fair trial. As a result, he claimed it was not hard to come to the decision that he would either have to ""die in Japan or ... get out"". Mr Ghosn believes he is the victim of a plot between Nissan and the Japanese judiciary. He alleges they wished to oust him from his role at the top of Nissan over concerns about Renault's growing influence. In 1999, he helped mastermind a deal that saw Renault rescue Nissan from the brink of bankruptcy. Now, the French carmaker has a 43% stake in its Japanese partner, while Nissan has a 15% stake in Renault. ""Some of my Japanese friends thought that the only way to get rid of the influence of Renault on Nissan, was to get rid of me,"" he said. But, responding to a question from the BBC, Mr Ghosn said he did not believe the plot went as high as Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe. On Tuesday, Japanese authorities issued a warrant for the arrest of Mr Ghosn's wife Carole, who was accused of giving false testimony. Mr Ghosn was arrested initially in November 2018. He was subsequently released on bail and put under house arrest, but he was banned from seeing his wife. Then, in the final days of 2019, he skipped bail to board a private jet that took him to Turkey before he travelled on to Lebanon, where he is a citizen, and where his wife was waiting.

"This video can not be played 'Iran appears to be standing down' - Trump delivers a statement at the White House Last night, shortly after Iran launched more than a dozen ballistic missiles toward US forces in retribution for the US assassination of Iranian General Qassem Suleimani, Donald Trump tweeted that ""all is well"". The following morning, he attempted to explain why he sees it this way. Here are five key passages from a 10-minute speech that suggests, for the moment, a tense situation may be easing somewhat. ""Iran appears to be standing down, which is a good thing for all parties concerned and a very good thing for the world."" The big question after last night's missile attack was whether the president would view the Iranian response as a reason to escalate the situation or, in the now popular phrase, ""to look for an exit ramp"". On Tuesday morning, he chose the latter. He heralded the lack of casualties and ""minimal damage"" from the Iranian strike. He praised the US military and promised ""more punishing economic sanctions"" - not, as some feared (and he hinted at earlier this week) a disproportionately overwhelming military response. That Trump opted not to strike back may give the Iranians an opportunity to claim he was the one who backed down. Make no mistake, however, Trump's was a victory speech - a reassertion of American dominance in the region - and it was just getting started. This video can not be played This footage, reportedly of the missile attack, was shown on Iranian state TV ""By removing Soleimani, we have sent a powerful message to terrorists: If you value your own life, you will not threaten the lives of our people."" Much of Trump's morning touted what had already been accomplished, not what was to come. He focused on establishing why Soleimani - the ""world's top terrorist"", he claimed - was a nefarious character who had long deserved the punishment Americans delivered. ""Soleimani's hands were drenched in both American and Iranian blood,"" he said, listing his support for militant armies, instigation of regional civil wars and targeting of US troops as evidence. He warned that Soleimani was planning further attacks on Americans - echoing previous, but so far unsubstantiated, US assertions that Soleimani's assassination prompted by an imminent threat to US interests. By focusing on Soleimani's death - and the message it sent - instead of Monday night's Iranian strikes, the president was in effect saying the outcome of this recent crisis was worth the drama and unrest it may have caused. The US drew its line, took out a malign actor and emerged mostly unscathed. But some commentators have warned against Trump gloating, because Iran's response could be ongoing. Latest updates on Iran missile strike The US, Iran and Soleimani story explained ""The missiles fired last night at us and our allies were paid for with the funds made available by the last administration."" If there's been one common, uniting theme to Trump's presidency so far, it's been a concerted effort to undo the legacy of his predecessor, Barack Obama. On healthcare, the environment, the economy, immigration and - in particular - the Iran nuclear deal, Trump has turned campaign criticisms into policy action. The funeral of an Iraqi paramilitary chief and friend of Soleimani also killed in the US drone strike It's not particularly surprising, then, that Trump would take the opportunity of a nationally televised address to swipe again at Obama. The Iran nuclear deal, negotiated during the Obama administration, released tens of billions of dollars of Iranian assets frozen in US banks after the 1979 Iranian revolution. There's no evidence these funds were used for Iran's missile programme - which was operational long before the multinational Iranian agreement was signed - but Trump's core contention, that the deal gave Iran political and financial breathing room to be more aggressive in the region, doesn't require receipts. Obama's Iran deal is gone, Trump effectively told the other signatory nations in his speech, and it's time to negotiate a new deal - a Trump deal - that makes the world ""a safer and more peaceful place"". ""Today, I am going to ask NATO to become much more involved in the Middle East process."" Trump's message to other nations didn't end with negotiating a new Iran deal, either. He wants Nato, the military alliance he has frequently belittled, to step up, too. It's been a contradiction of Trump's foreign policy that while he frequently speaks of disentangling the US from foreign commitments, he often takes actions that seem to risk miring the US in a wider Middle East conflict. Now, after ordering a strike against a senior Iranian military official that could have prompted a direct clash with Iranian forces, the president is again talking of scaling back. The US's economy is booming and is now energy independent, he said, perhaps suggesting - or warning - that it's time for US allies to shoulder more of the Middle East burden. Of course, Middle East instability can affect the global energy market, raising prices in the US no matter whether that oil and gas comes from North Dakota shale deposits or a Persian Gulf oil well. A US exit from the Middle East would be neither clean nor easy. Is there more to come from Iran? US presidents and the fuzzy legality of war ""As long as I am president of the United States, Iran will never be allowed to have a nuclear weapon."" The president started his speech with a teaser, as it's called in the news business. Before even saying good morning, he started with a guarantee - a show of strength and a promise of security. There were a lot of theatrical touches to the president's Tuesday morning appearance. He stood before a phalanx of stern-looking, award draped military leaders, flanked by senior members of his administration. Trump surrounded by generals The imagery of his entry into the room, his figure silhouetted against a blaze of light from an open window, bordered on the messianic. While his delivery was muted and short-of-breath - and the speech itself was a hodgepodge - pictures still carry punch in American politics. There's no telling whether this recent Iranian crisis will have any long-term political benefit for the president - and even less certainty of whether it will be a positive development for the security of the US and the world as a whole. But expect the image of Donald Trump as commander in chief, surrounded by the trappings of power and authority, taking credit for the deaths of Soleimani's and Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, to be a common theme in his upcoming re-election campaign.

"This video can not be played The PM said the government would work to prevent an escalation of violence Boris Johnson has said General Qasem Soleimani, killed by a US drone strike last week, had ""the blood of British troops on his hands"". He told the Commons the Iranian general was also responsible for a string of attacks on innocent civilians but called for ""urgent de-escalation"". He warned Iran not to repeat ""reckless"" attacks after ballistic missiles were fired at Iraqi air bases earlier. Iran's Revolutionary Guard said they were in response to Soleimani's death. It came as President Trump on Wednesdayurged countries including the UK- to send a ""clear and united message"" to Iran that its ""campaign of terror"" will no longer be tolerated. Mr Trump also called on the UK and its other European allies to abandon the nuclear deal it signed with Iran nuclear deal with in 2015. But, at Prime Minister's Questions earlier, Mr Johnson defended the deal, saying it remains the ""best way of preventing nuclear proliferation in Iran"". How much influence does UK have in Iran crisis? Iran nuclear deal crisis in 300 words Is the Iran nuclear deal dead and buried? In his first PMQs since Parliament returned from its Christmas break, Mr Johnson said there were no UK casualties in the attacks on Iraqi air bases ""as far as we can tell"". ""We, of course, condemn the attack on Iraqi military bases hosting coalition forces,"" Mr Johnson said. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn questioned the legality of the drone strike ordered by US President Donald Trump thatkilled Soleimani outside Baghdad airport on Friday. The PM said it was not up the UK to determine whether the strike was legal ""since it was not our operation"", but added: ""I think most reasonable people would accept that the United States has the right to protect its bases and its personnel."" How much influence does UK have in Iran crisis? Iran targets US troops with missile strikes His comments come after Foreign Secretary Dominic Raabrejected the idea that the killing was an act of war. Mr Johnson and President Trump have discussed the air strike on Iraqi bases over the phone. A Downing Street spokesman said the prime minister stressed the need for ""urgent de-escalation to avoid further conflict"". This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn asks Boris Johnson if the killing of General Qasem Soleimani was illegal Mr Johnson told MPs that Soleimani had supplied ""improvised explosive devices to terrorists"" which ""killed and maimed British troops"", adding: ""That man had the blood of British troops on his hands."" Mr Corbyn's spokesman later said it was ""hard to see"" how Soleimani's assassination could be justified as a legal action. ""Since the assassination of senior officials, generals, or ministers of internationally recognised governments is, on the face of it, entirely illegal in international law, that defence - the defence of an imminent threat - has to be made public for there to be any question of there being legality around it,"" the spokesman told a Westminster briefing. He added: ""No such evidence has been forthcoming and, on the face of it, it's hard to see how that would be the case."" It has taken a while to hear from Boris Johnson directly and I suspect that will surprise a lot of people. It's been five days since this crisis erupted and this is the first we've heard from him. He's only talking about it today, frankly, because he has to at PMQs. This is because of a new approach from No 10. They want to delegate more responsibility to other cabinet ministers and not have the PM responding to every event and crisis. But it also reflects the fact that in this post-Brexit world, Mr Johnson is having to perform a very delicate balancing act. On the one hand, he wants to stay close to the Europeans, who we want good relations and a speedy trade deal with. On the other, he doesn't want to antagonise the US, with whom we want similar things. That's why you heard him talking about working solidly with the EU to dial down the conflict but at the same time defending President Trump's right to act as he did. The bottom line is that as Brexit unfolds, Mr Johnson is going to have to get pretty good at this diplomatic high-wire act. Mr Corbyn said US-Iran tensions were in ""real risk"" of developing into ""full-scale war"" and asked the prime minister whether British personnel in the area were safe. Mr Johnson said: ""As far as we can tell there were no casualties last night sustained by the US and no British personnel were injured in the attacks. ""We are doing everything we can to protect UK interests in the region, with HMS Defender and HMS Montrose operating in an enhanced state of readiness to protect shipping in the Gulf."" Mr Johnson will later discuss the situation at a meeting with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Which bases were targeted? Analysis: Is there more to come from Iran? This video can not be played This footage, reportedly of the missile attack, was shown on Iranian state TV Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei describedthe missile attackas ""a slap in the face"" for the US. The strike showed just a ""small part"" of the capabilities of the Iranian armed forces, the chief of staff for the military said. But Iran's ambassador to the UK, Hamid Baeidinejad,said the attack was an act of self-defence,externaland the country ""does not seek escalation or war"". More than a dozen missiles were fired from Iranian territories into Iraq at about 02:00 local time on Wednesday (22:30 GMT on Tuesday). The al Asad airbase - located in the Anbar province of western Iraq - was hit by at least six missiles. Lydia Wilson of the University of Oxford's Centre for the Resolution of Intractable Conflict, called it a ""symbolic"" attack that was not designed to ""really damage"" US or Iraqi military capabilities. Noting that Iran used ballistic missiles rather than more sophisticated cruise missiles, she said: ""Iran was not going to risk a major escalation in this climate. They're very overstretched in the region... they're not going to easily take on the biggest military in the world."" There are about 400 UK troops stationed in Iraq, primarily to assist Iraqi troops in defeating the Islamic State group. A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: ""We are urgently working to establish the facts on the ground. Our first priority continues to be the security of British personnel."" Defence Secretary Ben Wallace added that further ""volatility"" would only benefit terrorist groups ""who will seek to capitalise on instability"". Iraqi security forces gathered pieces of the missiles In the UK, police were ""extremely alert"" to any impact the crisis in Iran may have in Britain, the Metropolitan Police commissioner Cressida Dick has said. On Tuesday, theRoyal Navy and military helicopters were put on standbyin the Gulf amid the rising tensions in the Middle East. The government said non-essential UK personnel had also been moved out of the Iraqi capital Baghdad. Iran had vowed ""severe revenge"" following the assassination of Soleimani. The general - who controlled Iran's proxy forces across the Middle East - was regarded as a terrorist by the US government. How much influence does UK have in Iran crisis?

"Kim says it's always been difficult to visit Iran, but the current situation makes things more unsafe ""I will probably never see my grandparents again."" Kim, 27, is a British Iranian living in the UK. Her parents came to the UK in their 20s, but she still has a lot of family still living there. The escalating tensions between Iran and the US have been causing Kim a lot of concern for her family. With the Americanassassination of top Iranian militarycommander General Qasem Soleimani and Iran'sretaliation missile strikeon a US military base - relations between the two countries are on a knife edge. Outside the region, British Iranians are concerned by what is happening in a country they consider to be a homeland. Radio 1 Newsbeat has been finding out what they feel about the situation. ""It's close to my heart and I'm worried about the family. We're all worried about them, their safety, their future,"" Kim tells Newsbeat. ""I don't think it's safe for any British dual national to go to Iran at the moment. I wouldn't feel comfortable if my parents went."" Millions of people have turned out to mourn General Qasem Soleimani in Iran Parsa Shahab is a British-Iranian finance student raised in Tehran, studying in the UK. He agrees with Kim that the current situation is scary for Iranians outside Iran. Parsa says his sister was in Iran when General Soleimani was assassinated, and he told her to return to the UK for her safety. ""Many of my friends at university had plans to go back to Iran after exams finish. But they've cancelled because they're too frightened about what's going to happen, and fears over airstrikes and attacks in Iran."" Franz Ferdinand and #WWIII: Why are these words trending? The US, Iran and Qasem Soleimani story explained in 400 words He also says there's been an impact on Iranian students who are relying on money from back home. ""Iranian currency has been hit. So students who are receiving funds from their parents are facing financial difficulties because the money has lower value."" ""So there's a lot of uncertainty for those of us outside the country too."" Parsa thinks any type of major conflict could lead to serious security problems in Iran Parsa, 21, stayed in Iran until he was 16, returning regularly to visit his family. He says General Soleimani and Iranian forces have been fighting IS and protecting Iran from terrorist attacks. ""So if there's going to be attacks and we have weak borders, I'm frightened."" Kim blames the decision by President Trump to kill General Soleimani for sparking more dangerous times in the region. ""I'm not a Soleimani sympathiser or supporter at all. But that act has made the world a much more dangerous place. So you have to also think about the innocent people that are going to suffer the consequences of his careless actions."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson said today that the General had ""the blood of British troops on his hands"". This video can not be played This footage, reportedly of the missile attack, was shown on Iranian state TV After Iran's response, some such as 23-year-old Ali Reza Shahrestani are worried about the effect on the country's economy. Ali is an entrepreneur working with businesses in the UK and Iran. ""Nobody wants to invest in areas where there's war. It's too risky. So you need to have a backup option. And as someone in business, people are looking elsewhere."" Ali says the heightened military tensions will have a major effect on investment and jobs. He says theinternet blackoutsin Iran create uncertainty. ""It happens a lot ... sometimes 12 days in a row. So there are threats to businesses because they work with tech and there's such a reliance on the internet now."" ""If people stop investing in the country, jobs are at risk."" Parsa agrees: ""What will happen to the many young Iranians who are educated, have startups, and want a better relationship with the West? With everything that's happening, they cannot have that. They can't progress."" Kim says being Iranian in the West, particularly in a time of tension, means people sometimes look at her differently. ""It's because of the perception of the Middle East. People have joked before 'oh you must be a bomber' when they've found out I'm Iranian."" And Ali has faced something similar in business. ""I have problems in meetings with investors simply because I am Iranian by blood. Even though I have a British passport, I am criticised because of my origin."" Ali says that the current tensions between Iran and the US have created unity amongst Iranians.

"Iran's missile capabilities are a key part of its military prowess Iran has launched more than a dozen missiles at two bases in Iraq housing US forces. It had vowed to retaliate after its most powerful military commander, General Qasem Soleimani, was killed by a US drone strike at Baghdad airport. So what do we know about Iran's military capabilities? Iran's missile systems are a key part of its military arsenal given its relative lack of air power. Regional rivals such as Israel and Saudi Arabia have the technology to carry out precision air strikes. Iran largely lacks this capability and so relies on launching missiles. A US Defense Department report describes the country's missile forces as the largest in the Middle East. It's not possible to give precise figures but the US-based Centre for Strategic and International Studies says Iran has thousands of missiles of more than a dozen different types. An Iranian media outlet reported that Fateh and Qiam missiles were used in the attack on the US base. Military analysts have also pointed to the use of these types based on images of the attack sites. The Qiam-1 missile has been widely produced since 2011, has a range of up 700km and a payload (an indication of how much explosive material it can carry) of 750kg.  It was used by Iran against IS fighters in June 2017. The Fateh class of missiles, which first went into service in the early 2000s, have a slightly lower payload. The variations of theShahab-3,externalintermediate range ballistic missile have payloads of more than 750kg and ranges upwards of 1,500km. For comparison, a US-built F35 fighter jet has a payload of up to 10,000kg. Iran has up to 50 medium range ballistic missile launchers and up to 100 short range ballistic missile launchers, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a UK-based think tank. Iran is also testing space technology to allow it to develop longer range inter-continental missiles, according to the US report. ""Iran has a highly developed missile force with weapons of a variety of ranges"" says Jonathan Marcus, the BBC's Defence and diplomatic correspondent. ""They are reasonably accurate - but not as accurate or as reliable as advanced western systems."" What is the Patriot missile defence system? The long-range missile programme was put on hold by Iran following the 2015 nuclear deal, according to the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), but this may now have resumedgiven the uncertainty surrounding that deal. In any case, many targets in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf would be within range of Iran's current short and medium-range missiles, and possibly targets in Israel as well. In May last year, the US deployed a Patriot anti-missile defence system to the Middle East as tensions with Iran increased. This is meant to counter ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and advanced aircraft. There are an estimated 523,000 active Iranian personnel, according to the IISS. This includes 350,000 in the regular army, and at least 150,000 in the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC). There are a further 20,000 service personnel in the IRGC's naval forces. This group operates a number of armed patrol boats in the Strait of Hormuz, the site of several confrontations involving foreign-flagged tankers in 2019. Seized British-flagged tanker leaves Iran The IRGC also controls the Basij unit, a volunteer force which has helped suppress internal dissent. This unit can potentially mobilise many hundreds of thousands of personnel. The IRGC has its own navy and air force, and oversees Iran's strategic weapons The IRGC was set up 40 years ago to defend the Islamic system in Iran and has become a major military, political and economic force in its own right. Profile: Iran's Revolutionary Guards Top Iranian general killed by US in Iraq Despite having fewer troops than the regular army, it is considered the most authoritative military force in Iran. The Quds Force, which was led by General Soleimani, conducts secret operations abroad for the IRGC and reports directly to the Supreme Leader of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. It's believed to be about 5,000 strong. The unit has been deployed to Syria, where it advised military elements loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and armed Shia militias fighting with them. In Iraq, it has supported a Shia-dominated paramilitary force which assisted in the defeat of IS. However, the US says the Quds force has a wider role by providing funding, training, weapons and equipment to organisations that Washington has designated as terrorist groups in the Middle East. These include Lebanon's Hezbollah movement and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Iran's IRGC detained the British-flagged tanker the Stena Impero in the Strait of Hormuz in 2019 Economic problems and sanctions have hampered Iran's arms imports, which are relatively small compared to those of other countries in the region. The value of Iran's defence imports between 2009 and 2018 was equivalent to just 3.5% of Saudi Arabia's imports over the same period, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. Most Iranian imports come from Russia, and the rest from China. Iran does not currently have a nuclear weapons programme, and has previously said it does not want one. But it does have many of the elements required and the knowledge to create a military nuclear capability. In 2015, the US government under President Obama estimated that Iran only needed two to three months to produce enough nuclear material to make a weapon. Iran nuclear deal: Key details Why do uranium enrichment limits matter? Is the Iran nuclear deal dead? The nuclear agreement that year between Tehran and six world powers - from which President Trump withdrew in 2018 -  introduced limits and international checks on Iran's nuclear activities. It aimed to make it more difficult and time consuming to develop weapons-grade material. Following the killing of General Soleimani by US forces, Iran has said it will not be bound by these restrictions. But it also says it will continue to co-operate with the UN's nuclear watchdog, the IAEA. The US has accused Iran of supplying Houthi rebels with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Despite years of sanctions, Iran has also been able to develop drone capabilities. In Iraq, Iranian drones have been used since 2016 in the fight against IS. Iran has also entered Israeli airspace with armed drones operated from bases in Syria, according to Rusi. In June 2019, Iran shot down a US surveillance drone, claiming it had violated Iranian airspace over the Strait of Hormuz. The other aspect of Iran's drone programme is its willingness to sell or transfer its drone technology to its allies and proxies in the region, says Jonathan Marcus,the BBC's Defence and diplomatic correspondent. In 2019, drone and missile attacks damaged two key Saudi oil facilities. Both the US and Saudi Arabia linked these attacks to Iran, although Tehran denied any involvement and pointed to a claim of responsibility by rebels in Yemen. Following a major cyber-attack in 2010 on Iranian nuclear facilities, Iran ramped up its own cyber-space capability. The Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) is believed to have its own cyber-command, working on commercial and military espionage. In 2012, US officials blamed Iran for a series of cyber attacks on US banks intended to disrupt traffic to their websites. A US military report in 2019 said Iran had also targeted aerospace companies, defence contractors, energy and natural resource companies and telecommunications firms for cyber-espionage operations around the world. Also in 2019, Microsoft said a hacker group that ""originates from Iran and is linked to the Iranian government""targeted a US presidential campaign and tried to break into the accounts of American government officials.,external Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions Follow us on Twitter,external LA mayor says winds and drought created 'perfect storm', while officials hit out at looters Climate 'whiplash' linked to raging LA fires Watch: The moment five US presidents gather at Jimmy Carter's funeral The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

"This video can not be played 'Iran appears to be standing down' - Trump delivers a statement at the White House US President Donald Trump has said Iran ""appears to be standing down"" after it fired missiles at air bases housing US forces in Iraq. Mr Trump, in a televised address from the White House, said no US or Iraqi lives were lost in the attacks and the bases suffered only minimal damage. The Irbil and Al Asad bases were attacked early on Wednesday local time. Iran said it acted in retaliation after the assassination of top Iranian General Qasem Soleimani last week. The US drone strike targeting him and Iran-backed militia figures in the Iraqi capital Baghdad was a major escalation amid already deteriorating relations between Iran and the US. How the day unfolded Five things to note from Trump's Iran speech ANALYSIS: Is there more to come from Iran? EXPLAINED: A quick guide to the story so far Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei described the missile attacks as a ""slap in the face"" for the US and called for an end to the American presence in the Middle East. On Wednesday evening at least two rockets fell in Baghdad's heavily fortified Green Zone, where the US embassy is located. There were no reports of any damage or casualties. The US attack on Soleimani killed members of pro-Iranian Iraqi militias, who have also said they would seek revenge. However, US Vice President Mike Pence told CBS News that ""intelligence"" indicated that Iran had asked its allied militias not to attack US targets. ""We're receiving some encouraging intelligence that Iran is sending messages to those very same militias not to move against American targets or civilians, and we hope that that message continues to echo,"" Mr Pence told the news channel. The president has previously threatened military action against Iran if it were to target US personnel and bases, but he did not announce any military action, saying Iran's attack had caused no casualties. ""No Americans were harmed in last night's attack by the Iranian regime,"" he said. This video can not be played This footage, reportedly of the missile attack, was shown on Iranian state TV ""Iran appears to be standing down, which is a good thing for all parties concerned,"" he added. He also said that ""American strength, both military and economic, is the best deterrent"". ""The fact that we have this great military and equipment, however, does not mean we have to use it."" Several missiles landed away from the bases Mr Trump also said the US would immediately impose additional financial and economic sanctions on Iran, which would remain until it ""changed its behaviour"". ""Iran must abandon its nuclear ambitions and end its support for terrorism,"" he said. ""The civilised world must send a clear and unified message to the Iranian regime. Your campaign of terror, murder and mayhem will not be tolerated any more. It will not be allowed to go forward."" President Trump's speech was a curious amalgam of threats, bluster - a touch of de-escalation. Nonetheless he still slapped on more economic sanctions against Tehran. He triumphed in the killing  of Gen Soleimani, whom he described as ""the world's top terrorist"". But there were essentially three key messages. First, de-escalation. There were no US casualties caused by the Iranian missile strikes. He said that Iran was ""standing down"", presumably returning its deployed missile forces to their bases. He did not threaten an immediate US response. Secondly - the nuclear deal.  He called upon the other signatories to the 2015 nuclear agreement - the JCPOA - which the US long ago abandoned, to similarly give it up as a bad job. Thirdly, stressing US energy independence, he called upon Nato countries ""to become much more involved in the Middle East process"". This will inevitably be seen as another signal that the US is tiring of its role in the region and THAT will not be welcomed by his allies either in the Middle East or in Nato. So this was a speech full of Trumpian contradiction and the few references to a brighter future for the Iranian people provided little tangible hope of any new diplomatic initiative. So in the wake of the US drone attack and Iran's missile strikes it appears to be back to business as usual. A total of 16 missiles were launched from at least three sites in Iran, Defence Secretary Mark Esper said. At least 11 of them struck the air base in Al Asad, west of Baghdad, and at least one more hit the Irbil base, he said. Did Iranian strike deliberately avoid US troops? Which bases were targeted? US sanctions on Iran: Six charts Several other missiles landed at some distance from the targets. The attacks happened at about 02:00 local time on Wednesday (22:30 GMT on Tuesday). Joint Chiefs Chairman Mark Milley said he believed early warning systems had prevented casualties. ""[What] I believe, based on what I saw and what I know, is that they were intended to cause structural damage, destroy vehicles and equipment and aircraft, and to kill personnel,"" he said. The attacks came just hours after the burial of Soleimani, who controlled Iran's proxy forces across the Middle East. It was the most direct assault by Iran on the US since the seizing of the US embassy in Tehran in 1979. Just hours after the missile strikesa Ukrainian airliner crashed in Iran shortly after take-off. There is no evidence that the two incidents are linked. Several airlines have announced they are avoiding both Iranian and Iraqi airspace amid the rising tension. The assassination of Soleimani - head of the Revolutionary Guards' elite Quds Force and architect of Iranian policy in the region - took place on 3 January. What British Iranians think about the rising tension UK foreign secretary condemns Iran missile strikes The general was regarded as a terrorist by the US government, which says he was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American troops and was plotting ""imminent"" attacks. This video can not be played Feeling the squeeze: Iran sanctions explained Iran vowed ""severe revenge"" for his death. Mr Trump, meanwhile, warned the US would respond in the event of retaliation ""perhaps in a disproportionate manner"". Millions of Iranians turned out for the commander's funeral, with mourners chanting ""death to America"" and ""death to Trump"". Why huge crowds turned out for Soleimani's funeral Voices from Iran: 'Qasem Soleimani did not deserve such a fate' A stampede at the burial in Soleimani's hometown Kerman killed 50 people and injured 200 more on Tuesday. Iran says the attack was in retaliation for killing the country's top commander Qasem Soleimani Is there more to come from Iran? Which bases were targeted?

"This video can not be played Royal correspondent Jonny Dymond: ""It is very clear the palace is very upset about what has happened"" The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have announced they will step back as ""senior"" royals and work to become financially independent. In a statement, Prince Harry and Meghan also said they plan to split their time between the UK and North America. The BBC understands no other royal - including the Queen or Prince William - was consulted before the statement and Buckingham Palace is ""disappointed"". Senior royals are understood to be ""hurt"" by the announcement. Last October, Prince Harry and Meghanpublicly revealed their strugglesunder the media spotlight. In their unexpected statement on Wednesday, alsoposted on their Instagram page,,externalthe couple said they made the decision ""after many months of reflection and internal discussions"". ""We intend to step back as 'senior' members of the Royal Family and work to become financially independent, while continuing to fully support Her Majesty The Queen."" In full: Buckingham Palace statement Harry and Meghan step back: What we know so far In pictures: Harry and Meghan's life together They said they plan to balance their time between the UK and North America while ""continuing to honour our duty to the Queen, the Commonwealth, and our patronages"". ""This geographic balance will enable us to raise our son with an appreciation for the royal tradition into which he was born, while also providing our family with the space to focus on the next chapter, including the launch of our new charitable entity."" BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond said the fact palace officials said they were ""disappointed"" is ""pretty strong"". ""I think it indicates a real strength of feeling in the palace tonight - maybe not so much about what has been done but about how it has been done - and the lack of consultation I think will sting. ""This is clearly a major rift between Harry and Meghan on one part, and the rest of the Royal Family on the other."" A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman said discussions with the duke and duchess on their decision to step back were ""at an early stage"", adding: ""We understand their desire to take a different approach, but these are complicated issues that will take time to work through."" Over Christmas, the couple took a six-week break from royal duties to spend some time in Canada with their son, Archie, who was born in May. After returning to the UK on Tuesday, Harry, 35, and Meghan, 38, visited Canada's High Commission in London to thank the country for hosting them and said the warmth and hospitality they received was ""unbelievable"". The couple, together with their son Archie, recently spent time in Canada During the visit, Meghan said it was an ""incredible time"" to enjoy the ""beauty of Canada"". ""To see Archie go 'ah' when you walk by, and just see how stunning it is - so it meant a lot to us."" Former actress Meghan lived and worked in Toronto during her time starring in the popular US drama Suits, and she hasseveral Canadian friends. Close up, it was painfully clear that there were great chunks of the job they simply could not stand. Both of them appeared to come alive with the crowds. But Harry hated the cameras and was visibly bored by the ceremonial. And though Meghan was often the consummate professional, at times her impatience with the everyday slog of the role sometimes broke through. She said she didn't want to become a voiceless figurehead; but when she raised her voice, she found criticism waiting for her. They both made their feelings known in the2019 interviewwith ITV's Tom Bradby. But beyond the detail, what was so shocking was how unhappy they both seemed. The sun-drenched wedding of the year before seemed like a dream; here were two people visibly struggling with their lives and positions. There are far more questions than answers; what will their new role be? Where will they live, and who will pay for it? What relationship will they have with the rest of the Royal Family? And there's the institutional question. What does this mean for the Royal Family? It comes just a few months after Prince Andrew stepped back from his duties. Some might see this as the slimmed-down monarchy that the 21st century needs. But Harry and Meghan reached people that other royals didn't. They were part of the reinvention and refreshing of the institution. This was not the way anyone would have planned its future. Former Buckingham Palace press officer Dickie Arbiter suggested the decision showed Prince Harry's ""heart ruling his head"". He told the BBC the ""massive press onslaught"" when their son Archie was born may have played a part in the decision. And he compared the move to Edward VIII's abdication in 1936 in order to marry twice-divorced American Wallis Simpson. ""That is the only other precedent, but there's been nothing like this in modern times,"" Mr Arbiter said. Meghan and Prince Harry married in May 2018 Asked how being a ""part-time"" member of the Royal Family might work, Mr Arbiter said he did not know. ""If they're going to be based in the UK, it means they are going to be doing a lot of flying [with] a big carbon footprint,"" he said, adding that this may ""raise eyebrows"". He also questioned how the couple would become financially independent. ""I mean, Harry is not a poor man, but to settle yourself in two different continents, to raise a family, to continue to do your work - how's the work going to be funded? ""How is their security going to be funded? ""Because they're still going to have to have security - who's going to have to pay for this? Where's the security coming from? Is the Metropolitan Police going to be providing it and if so whether there's going to be any contribution in covering the security cost?"" Mr Arbiter also suggested questions would be raised over why Â£2.4m of taxpayer's money was spent onrenovating the couple's home, Frogmore Cottagein Windsor, if they will now be living elsewhere for some of the year. Harry and Meghan met senior Canadian diplomats in London earlier this week BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond said the couple have ""considerable savings"", including Harry's inheritance from Princess Diana's estate and the money Meghan earned as an actress. But, asked about whether they might get jobs, he added: ""There is a problem for members of the Royal Family - relatively senior ones, even if they say they're no longer senior - getting jobs, because they are seen to monetise their brand and you run into a whole host of questions about conflict of interest"". He added that we are now in ""wait and see mode"" as to whether this new model of being a royal can work - ""or if this is really a staging post for them to leave the Royal Family"". The Prince of Walespays for the public dutiesof Harry, Meghan, William and Kate and some of their private costs, out of his Duchy of Cornwall income, which was Â£21.6m last year. Accounts from Clarence House show this funding - in the year Meghan officially joined the Royal Family - stood at just over Â£5m, up 1.8% on 2017-18. Royal author Penny Junor said she ""can't quite see how it's going to work"", adding: ""I don't think it's been properly thought through."" ""I think it's extraordinary but also I think it's rather sad,"" she said. ""They may not feel they are particularly loved but actually they are very much loved."" This video can not be played In a 2019 interview Meghan said it was a âstruggleâ becoming a mother amid intense media scrutiny Harry issixth in line to the throne- behind Prince Charles, Prince William and his three children. In an ITV documentary last year, Meghan admitted motherhood was a ""struggle"" due to intense interest from newspapers. Prince Harry also responded to reports of a rift between him and his brother William, the Duke of Cambridge, by saying they were on ""different paths"". In October, the duchessbegan legal actionagainst the Mail on Sunday over a claim that it unlawfully published one of her private letters. And the dukealso began legal actionagainst the owners of the Sun, the defunct News of the World, and the Daily Mirror, in relation to alleged phone-hacking. This video can not be played Prince Harry on his brother, William in 2019: ""We are certainly on different paths at the moment"" Prince Harry also released a statement, saying: ""I lost my mother and now I watch my wife falling victim to the same powerful forces."" The duke and duchessmoved out of Kensington Palace,where the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge live, in 2018 to set up their family home in Windsor. Then last summer,they split from the charitythey shared with Prince William and Kate to set up their own charitable projects.

The Iraqi military said Iran fired five missiles towards Irbil air base, in the northern Kurdistan region. It did not say how many hit the base, but state TV reported that two missiles landed in the village of Sidan, 16km (10 miles) north-west of the city of Irbil, and that a third missile came down in the Bardah Rashsh area, about 47km north-west of Irbil. Journalists meanwhile photographed residents standing beside what they believed was the crater caused by the missile that hit Bardah Rashsh. Iranâs Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) said it
launched attacks on Iraqi bases housing US forces in retaliation for the US

terrorist and aggressor army of the US in Al Asadâ, the hub for American
military operations in western Iraq. Iranâs Tasnim news agency, which is close to the IRGC,
reported that Fateh-313 and Qiam missiles were used in the attack ,
and that US forces failed to intercept them because they were equipped with

Iranâs Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, called the attack a âslap in the faceâ for the Americans. But he said it was more important to end the US military presence in the region. President Donald Trump said US forces suffered no casualties as a result of the Iranian missile attacks and the bases sustained âonly minimal damageâ. He credited âthe precautions taken, the dispersal of forces, and an early warning system that worked very wellâ, and declared that âIran appears to be standing downâ. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said he was ""shocked and saddened"" by the news of the plane crash thought to have killed 176 people in Iran. Officials have said 63 Canadians and 82 Iranians - some of whom held dual nationalities - were on board the Ukraine International Airlines flight PS752 which crashed in Tehran earlier. Mr Trudeau offered his ""deepest condolence"" to the families of those killed in the crash, which happened just hours after the Iranian missile strikes. The two are not thought to be linked. ""Today, I assure all Canadians that their safety and security is our top priority,""he said in a statement.,external ""We also join with the other countries who are mourning the loss of citizens.""

Eleven Ukrainians, including all nine crew, died on the Ukraine International Airlines flight from Tehran to Kyiv, Ukrainian officials said. The county's foreign minister, Vadym Prystaiko, thanked Canada, which lost 63 citizens in the disaster, some with dual nationality. The crash came just hours after the Iranian missile strike on Iraq military bases used by the US.There was no evidence that the two incidents were linked. Officials have confirmed that 63 Canadians were on board the passenger jet that crashed early on Wednesday on its way to Ukraine from Tehran. The crash is thought to have killed all 176 people on board. A Toronto realtor on holiday with his wife, and at least 10 students from four Ontario universities were among those killed, Canadian media reported. And at least 30 of the Canadian victims hailed from Edmonton, Alberta, local media said, most with ties to the University of Alberta, including two University of Alberta professors travelling with their two young daughters. Reza Akbari, the president of the city's Iranian Heritage Societytold the Edmonton Journal,externalthat he was in ""shock"" at the news. ""I can tell you pretty much every Iranian in Edmonton knew some of them, so itâs very devastating,"" Akbari said. Online tributes poured in for the victims, identified as university students, professors and professionals coming back to Canada after the winter holiday. President Trump has received praise for his measured speech this morning, appearing to de-escalate tensions with Iran. But has it helped his popularity? According to FiveThirtyEight - a statistics-based news website - the answer is not much. Throughout the US-Iranian conflict of the past week, FiveThirtyEight has found Trump's approval sitting steady - at around 41.9%, while his disapproval rating remains at around 53.3%. A look at the headlines across major US outlets. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson spoke with President Trump today, the White House has confirmed. It said the two leaders discussed ""the current situation in the Middle East and agreed to continue close coordination in support of shared national security interests."" UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab is set to meet with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo this evening. The meeting had originally been expected to take place on Thursday. In his speech, Mr Trump called for the UK and other countries to ""break away from the remnants of the Iran deal"". ""We must all work together toward making a deal with Iran that makes the world a safer and more peaceful place,â he said.  The US president has been accused of breaking international law with the US strike on Qasem Soleimani. Did he do anything illegal? And what other US presidents have faced similar accusations?

Jonathan MarcusBBC Diplomatic and defence correspondent President
Trumpâs speech was a curious amalgam of threats, bluster â and a touch of
de-escalation. Nonetheless he still slapped-on more economic sanctions against
Tehran. He triumphed in the killing of General Suleimani, who he
described as âthe worldâs top terrorist.â But there were essentially three key
messages. First, de-escalation. There were no US casualties caused by the
Iranian missile strikes. He said that Iran was âstanding downâ, presumably
returning its deployed missile forces to their bases. He did not threaten an
immediate US response. Second, the nuclear deal. He called upon the
other parties to the nuclear agreement - the JCPOA - which the US long-ago
abandoned, to similarly give it up as a bad job. Third, stressing US energy
independence, he called upon Nato countries âto become much more involved in
the Middle East processâ. This will inevitably be seen as another signal that
the US is tiring of its role in the region and that will not be welcomed by his allies either in the Middle East or in Nato. So
this was a speech full of Trumpian contradiction and the few references to a
brighter future for the Iranian people provided little tangible hope of any new
diplomatic initiative. In the wake of the US drone attack and Iranâs missile
strikes, it appears to be back to business as usual. Senior US Democrats have told reporters that no schedule has been set yet for voting on a war powers resolution to limit President Trump's military actions regarding Iran. The officials said the legislation was still being drafted. Democratic lawmakers want to put a check on the president's powers after he failed to inform Congress ahead of the US drone strike that killed Soleimani. Top DemocratNancy Pelosi has said the resolution will be introduced this week.,external  Sir Simon Fraser, a former senior foreign office diplomat, spoke to the BBC ahead of Mr Tump's speech about the consequences of the killing of Qasem Soleimani.

This video can not be played Trump: 'Iran appears to be standing down' The BBC spoke to people inside Iran about what they thought of the missile attack. Here are a few of the responses. ""This attack had to be done. War is not good but the USA
has been a big bully lately. It had to be stopped. I am sure that Iran wonât
take further steps."" - Ramis ""Iranâs attack was pathetic. One of the countryâs biggest
commanders was killed and in revenge, they [launch an] attack with no
significant damage or casualties ...This was like a failed test
for Iran and from now, Israel and the US can do anything."" - Afshin ""It was just some action to show the Iranian people that
we took revenge. Both Iran and the US know the regionâs current situation and
neither wants to go to war. It was just a political act to start negotiations."" - Nazanin ""This attack was necessary. The US should know that if
they want to harm us it wonât be without an answer."" - Mohammad UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has landed in Washington DC for a talks with senior members of Congress and a meeting with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. ""A chance to discuss the importance of the UK/US security partnership and the need to de-escalate the situation in Iraq,"" he wrote on Twitter. Aleem MaqboolBBC North America correspondent The missile launch may have been the most direct assault by Iran on the US for decades, but the apparent lack of casualties gave Donald Trump an opportunity to de-escalate tensions â one that he appears to have taken. The US President had previously promised to respond to an attack on any American target âquickly and fullyâ and in his words âperhaps in a disproportionate mannerâ. But â in a statement at the White House, surrounded by top officials â he said the attacks in Irbil and close to Baghdad constituted Iran âstanding downâ. He even talked of the US and Iran working together to counter the Islamic State group. Of course, there may be more retaliation to come from Tehran for the killing of its top general Qasem Soleimani, but the threat of all out war appears have diminished a little. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Ms Trump was interviewed on stage in a packed auditorium Ivanka Trump's appearance at the CES tech show went smoothly, despite controversy surrounding her invitation. Somehad criticised a decision to give her a ""keynote"" slot, saying other women had more expertise in the field. On stage, the US president's daughter suggested Americans' CV data should be stored and updated on their phones as a matter of course, to make it easier for them to apply for jobs. She seemed not to want to ""ruffle feathers"", one attendee told the BBC. Ms Trump was interviewed in front of an audience of trade show delegates in Las Vegas by Gary Shapiro, chief of the Consumer Technology Association (CTA), which organises CES. ""Why can't you have your high school degree verified and in your phone, so an employer doesn't need to call your high school?"" she asked him rhetorically. Skills obtained on health and safety courses, or in manufacturing roles, she suggested, could be logged. ""All of that should be catalogued and tracked and available and accessible,"" Ms Trump added. CES chief defends invite for Ivanka Trump 'Reverse microwave oven' cools drinks in seconds The foldable computer of the future Last year,a white paper published by the US government,externaldescribed the concept - known as interoperable learning records - in detail. Ms Trump also said that more could be done to help those without college degrees enter the workforce. And she gained a round of applause for praising the introduction of paid parental leave for US government workers. Critics had called for the event to be boycotted. But a large audience packed into a hotel conference centre to see and hear Ms Trump. ""It seemed clear as a member of the administration that she didn't want to ruffle any feathers,"" said Adam Smith, contributing UK editor for PCMag. He added that the atmosphere had been ""accommodating"" to Ms Trump. ""A debate may be worthwhile on whether her presence took the place of a more experienced woman in the tech sector or the merits of her political views, but it would be difficult to fault her on the delivery of her message,"" he added. Ms Trump and her husband Jared Kushner will next attend the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland as part of the White House delegation later this month. Attendees of Ms Trump's keynote had to abide by certain rules I wasn't sure what to expect from Ivanka Trump's much-hyped CES keynote. Would the grand Venetian Ballroom auditorium be full, or would the threatened boycott keep the crowds away? Would she be booed or cheered? It was no doubt a lucrative day to be a security guard here in Las Vegas. Men in black wearing silver ""cop security"" badges  were everywhere, and long queues of CES delegates snaked across the floors. ""No selfie sticks, no signs, no oversized bags,"" we were instructed. The hall was soon packed out. Ivanka Trump and Gary Shapiro emerged, a few minutes late, to enthusiastic applause. This audience was clearly not going to heckle, and it was also apparent that Mr Shapiro had no intention of giving Ms Trump what we journalists would call a grilling. Ms Trump was articulate and on-message about her father's government's strategies in tackling unemployment in the US. She spoke passionately about the high price of childcare, her diamond rings sparkling under the stage lights. Critics had questioned whether Ms Trump was ""qualified"" to speak at the tech show It was a very smooth performance - but it lacked any drama. Our camerawoman Cody was at the back of the hall. She told me that a small but steady trickle of people walked out discreetly before the end. About 12 minutes in, I noticed the head of the gentleman on my left in the press seats slowly sink towards his chest. He closed his eyes, appearing to snooze. I wondered briefly whether to give him a collegiate nudge, but decided ultimately he probably wasn't going to miss any excitement. And he didn't.

"London MP Sir Keir Starmer is a former director of public prosecutions Sir Keir Starmer has won the backing of the UK's largest trade union, Unison, to become the next Labour leader. Unison, which has 1.3 million members, said the shadow Brexit secretary was best placed of the candidates to unite the party and regain public trust. Unite, Labour's largest financial backer, will decide later this month who to back in the contest. Sir Keir has also become the first to secure enough nominations from MPs,externaland MEPs to get on the ballot paper. The Holborn and St Pancras MP has, so far, secured the backing of 41 colleagues - well above the minimum of 22 required. Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long Bailey is his closest competitor, followed by Jess Phillips. Nominations close on 13 January and the winner will be announced on 4 April following a ballot of party members, trade union and other affiliates and registered supporters. Who will be Labour's next leader? New Labour leader to be announced on 4 April Corbyn won't endorse any leadership contenders As the contest gathers pace, BBC Newsnight correspondent Lewis Goodall reported that Barry Gardiner, the party's international trade spokesman, could become a candidate. The Brent North MP has yet to confirm this. Unison's endorsement, which was agreed by a committee of ""working people from across the country"", is a major boost for Sir Keir's campaign. Announcing its decision, the union said it believed the former director of public prosecutions was capable of taking Labour back into government. General Secretary Dave Prentis said working people depended on Labour being in power to change their lives. ""We believe - if elected by the membership - Keir Starmer would be a leader to bring the party together and win back the trust of the thousands of voters who deserted Labour last month,"" he said. ""Keir has a clear vision to get Labour back to the winning ways of the past. He is best placed to take on Boris Johnson, hold his government to account and ensure Labour can return to power."" The union, which represents workers across the NHS, schools and other public services, backed Jeremy Corbyn in 2015 and 2016. The BBC's political correspondent Iain Watson said Sir Keir was the overwhelming choice of the union's Link Committee, having won more support than all of the other candidates combined. This video can not be played Who decides on the next Labour leader? He has also recruited Simon Fletcher to his campaign team - Jeremy Corbyn's former chief of staff who ran his successful leadership bid in 2015. Mrs Long Bailey has Momentum founder Jon Lansman as her campaign director and former spokesman for Mr Corbyn, Matt Zarb-Cousin, as her director of communications. Sir Keir told the BBC he was ""delighted"" by the endorsement but played down talk of him now being the frontrunner, telling the BBC ""there was a long way to go"" in the contest. ""What I want to do is lead a united Labour Party that works with trade unions to bring them together to face the future,"" he said. It caps a good day for the shadow Brexit secretary, whose growing number of parliamentary backers include former foreign secretary Margaret Beckett, the new shadow culture secretary Tracy Brabin and Tottenham MP David Lammy. Mrs Long Bailey's 17 backers include shadow home secretary Diane Abbott, while Birmingham Yardley MP Jess Phillips has the support of 16 colleagues, including Wes Streeting and Margaret Hodge - outspoken critics of Mr Corbyn over his handling of anti-Semitism allegations. Wigan MP Lisa Nandy has 11 nominations, while shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry has three. Shadow Treasury minister Clive Lewis has secured his first nomination from Rachael Maskell. Earlier, Mr Lewis rated Mr Corbyn ""six out of 10"" as leader of the Labour Party. Speaking to the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme, he criticised the outgoing leader for making mistakes on Brexit and dealing with anti-Semitism. ""But some things he got right,"" Mr Lewis added, ""so in many ways he's renewed our party.""The comments follow those of Mrs Long Bailey, who rated Mr Corbyn 10 out of 10 for his performance as leader, despite Labour's electoral defeat. This video can not be played Clive Lewis, who wants to replace Jeremy Corbyn, said Labour must build alliances to win back power In the race to become Labour's next deputy leader,external, shadow education secretary Ms Rayner way out in front so far in terms of nominations with 45 and has also won Unison's backing. Before entering Parliament, Ms Rayner was a local Unison representative while employed as a care worker in Greater Manchester. Ian Murray, Scotland's only remaining Labour MP, is second in the list of declared backers so far while shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon is third. As of Wednesday evening, shadow women and equalities minister Dawn Butler and Tooting MP Rosena Allin-Khan both had seven nominations.

"The Commons has rejected an attempt by Labour to reinstate child refugee protection rights in the Brexit bill. MPs voted 348 to 252 against the amendment, which would have guaranteed the right of unaccompanied child refugees to be reunited with family living in the UK after Brexit. The pledge was included in a previous version of the Brexit bill, but was removed after the Tories' election win. The government said it had ""a proud record of helping vulnerable children."" MPs voted on the Labour amendment during a second day of scrutiny of the Brexit bill - or EU Withdrawal Agreement Bill as it is officially known. That's the legislation implementing Boris Johnson's Brexit deal and it must be passed by both the Commons and Lords if the UK is to leave the EU on 31 January - the current deadline. EU 'must avoid lost generation' of young refugees MPs resume scrutiny of PM's Brexit bill What is the Withdrawal Agreement Bill? Labour's Lord Dubs - who came to the UK as a child to escape the Nazis - had campaigned for the commitment to be included in the bill. It was included in Theresa May's Brexit bill, but was removed in Boris Johnson's version, something he called ""appalling and deeply distressing"". The newly-worded bill replaced the commitment to negotiate with the EU a continuation of the rights of child refugees with a reduced obligation to make statements to Parliament on the government's child refugee policy after Brexit. In the Commons, shadow Brexit minister Thangam Debbonaire made the case for the Labour amendment, arguing that removing it from the bill was an ""astonishing breach of faith with some of the most vulnerable children in the world"". Backing its return was ""about who we want to be as a country"". ""It is deeply wrong for the government to seek to remove this provision... just because they can,"" she went on. ""Family reunion should not need explaining, but it appears it does. Families belong together."" Lord Dubs came to the UK on the Kindertransport aged six and later became a Labour MP Lord Dubs and shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer earlier wrote to Conservative MPs urging them to support Labour's amendment to reinstate the pledge. They said: ""We know that there are many Conservative MPs, including some sat around the cabinet table, who know that this decision was wrong. ""Boris Johnson may have won a majority in Parliament, but he did not win the moral argument to absolve himself of responsibility to some of the most vulnerable people in the world. ""With the numbers in Parliament being what they are, it's up to you - Conservative MPs - to take a moral stance and force the government to rethink its approach on this vital issue."" The Liberal Democrats have also called for the government to rethink what they call an ""inhumane"" position. Northern Ireland minister Robin Walker told MPs the government was ""fully committed"" to the principle of family reunion and its policy ""has not changed"". However, they will not be backing the amendment to see it guaranteed in law. Mr Walker said the policy of reuniting families would continue during the transition period while a deal is being negotiated with the EU on the future trading relationship with the UK. He said Home Secretary Priti Patel had written to the European Commission in October to start negotiations on what would happen after that period's end in December 2020. ""We give very strong support for the principle of family reunion,"" Mr Walker added. ""But the right place to do that is not in this legislation and we do not need further reporting requirements or legally binding negotiating objectives, as these amendments set out."" MPs gave their initial approval for Boris Johnson's Brexit bill in December, but it is now undergoing more detailed Commons scrutiny. The bill covers ""divorce"" payments to the EU, citizens' rights, customs arrangements for Northern Ireland and the proposed 11-month transition period lasting from 1 February to 31 December. The bill is expected to comfortably pass its remaining stages in the Commons by Thursday before moving to the Lords. Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay said the bill would deliver on the ""overwhelming mandate"" his party had been given by the voters to take the UK out of the EU on 31 January. While shadow Brexit minister Paul Blomfield said Labour accepted their opponents' decisive election victory had changed the political landscape he said he still believed this was a ""bad deal"" for the UK and urged the government to proceed ""with caution"".

"Legal action is being launched against the NHS over the prescribing of drugs to delay puberty. Papers have been lodged at the High Court by a mother and a nurse against the Tavistock and Portman NHS Trust, which runs the UK's only gender-identity development service (Gids). Lawyers will argue it is illegal to prescribe the drugs, as children cannot give informed consent to the treatment. The Tavistock said it had a ""cautious and considered"" approach to treatment. Papers were formally lodged on Wednesday by the lawyers for the complainants. The Tavistock will have three weeks to submit its response, after which a judge will consider the case and decide on the timings of any hearings. The nurse, Sue Evans, left the Gids more than a decade ago after becoming increasingly concerned teenagers who wanted to transition to a different gender were being given the puberty blockers without adequate assessments and psychological work. Since then, she says, even younger children are being given the drugs, which block the hormones that lead to puberty-related changes including periods and facial hair. The number of young people referred to the Gids rose from 678 in 2014-15 to 2,590 in the past year. Of these 2,590: more than 1,700 wanted to transition to male 624 wanted to transition to female most were in their early to mid-teens 171 were under 10 Ms Evans said: ""I used to feel concerned it was being given to 16-year-olds. ""But now, the age limit has been lowered - and children as young as perhaps nine or 10 are being asked to give informed consent to a completely experimental treatment for which the long-term consequences are not known."" The mother, known only as Mrs A, has a 15-year-old with autism who is on the waiting list for treatment at the Gids. She told BBC News her child presents to the outside world as a boy but, while she is happy to allow that, she is extremely concerned about the possibility of drugs that are not fully understood being prescribed. ""I'm worried that they will look at her age and say, 'Well, she still says this is what she wants and therefore we will put her on to a medical pathway,'"" Mrs A told BBC News. ""And given her communication of what she feels internally is slightly different because of her autism spectrum, I worry that what she says and what she means are often two different things."" What are puberty blockers? They are drugs which can pause the development of things like breasts, periods, facial hair and voice breaking They can be prescribed to children with gender dysphoria who feel their sex at birth doesn't match up with their gender. This is meant to give them more time to weigh up their options before they go through the physical changes of puberty. Although puberty blockers are described by the NHS as reversible, Gids acknowledgesthat their impact on brain development and psychological health is not fully known,external. Read more:What are puberty blockers? Mrs A said her child was too young to really assess the potential impact of puberty blockers on the rest of their life, including such things as fertility. ""As an adolescent, what we think will make us happy is not necessarily what will make us happy,"" she told BBC News. ""It might help us in the short term - but it might not help us in the long term."" A Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust official said: ""It is not appropriate for us to comment in detail in advance of any proposed legal proceedings.

"Kim says it's always been difficult to visit Iran, but the current situation makes things more unsafe ""I will probably never see my grandparents again."" Kim, 27, is a British Iranian living in the UK. Her parents came to the UK in their 20s, but she still has a lot of family still living there. The escalating tensions between Iran and the US have been causing Kim a lot of concern for her family. With the Americanassassination of top Iranian militarycommander General Qasem Soleimani and Iran'sretaliation missile strikeon a US military base - relations between the two countries are on a knife edge. Outside the region, British Iranians are concerned by what is happening in a country they consider to be a homeland. Radio 1 Newsbeat has been finding out what they feel about the situation. ""It's close to my heart and I'm worried about the family. We're all worried about them, their safety, their future,"" Kim tells Newsbeat. ""I don't think it's safe for any British dual national to go to Iran at the moment. I wouldn't feel comfortable if my parents went."" Millions of people have turned out to mourn General Qasem Soleimani in Iran Parsa Shahab is a British-Iranian finance student raised in Tehran, studying in the UK. He agrees with Kim that the current situation is scary for Iranians outside Iran. Parsa says his sister was in Iran when General Soleimani was assassinated, and he told her to return to the UK for her safety. ""Many of my friends at university had plans to go back to Iran after exams finish. But they've cancelled because they're too frightened about what's going to happen, and fears over airstrikes and attacks in Iran."" Franz Ferdinand and #WWIII: Why are these words trending? The US, Iran and Qasem Soleimani story explained in 400 words He also says there's been an impact on Iranian students who are relying on money from back home. ""Iranian currency has been hit. So students who are receiving funds from their parents are facing financial difficulties because the money has lower value."" ""So there's a lot of uncertainty for those of us outside the country too."" Parsa thinks any type of major conflict could lead to serious security problems in Iran Parsa, 21, stayed in Iran until he was 16, returning regularly to visit his family. He says General Soleimani and Iranian forces have been fighting IS and protecting Iran from terrorist attacks. ""So if there's going to be attacks and we have weak borders, I'm frightened."" Kim blames the decision by President Trump to kill General Soleimani for sparking more dangerous times in the region. ""I'm not a Soleimani sympathiser or supporter at all. But that act has made the world a much more dangerous place. So you have to also think about the innocent people that are going to suffer the consequences of his careless actions."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson said today that the General had ""the blood of British troops on his hands"". This video can not be played This footage, reportedly of the missile attack, was shown on Iranian state TV After Iran's response, some such as 23-year-old Ali Reza Shahrestani are worried about the effect on the country's economy. Ali is an entrepreneur working with businesses in the UK and Iran. ""Nobody wants to invest in areas where there's war. It's too risky. So you need to have a backup option. And as someone in business, people are looking elsewhere."" Ali says the heightened military tensions will have a major effect on investment and jobs. He says theinternet blackoutsin Iran create uncertainty. ""It happens a lot ... sometimes 12 days in a row. So there are threats to businesses because they work with tech and there's such a reliance on the internet now."" ""If people stop investing in the country, jobs are at risk."" Parsa agrees: ""What will happen to the many young Iranians who are educated, have startups, and want a better relationship with the West? With everything that's happening, they cannot have that. They can't progress."" Kim says being Iranian in the West, particularly in a time of tension, means people sometimes look at her differently. ""It's because of the perception of the Middle East. People have joked before 'oh you must be a bomber' when they've found out I'm Iranian."" And Ali has faced something similar in business. ""I have problems in meetings with investors simply because I am Iranian by blood. Even though I have a British passport, I am criticised because of my origin."" Ali says that the current tensions between Iran and the US have created unity amongst Iranians. ""Even if people are against the regime and didn't like the general, when someone attacks us, everyone in Iran tries to unite and come together. And you can see that on the streets."" He's not surprised by Iran's response because ""they'll always protect"" Iranians. This video can not be played Is expecting Iran to de-escalate realistic? Some commentators think Iran's retaliatory strike could actually lead to a de-escalation in tensions. And Parsa, Kim and Ali all want the same thing. ""We were taking steps forward before Trump was elected, I hope we can return to that. But it's just so hard to know what's going to happen,"" says Kim. Parsa adds: ""Iran and the US haven't had peace for a long time. So assuming there's not going to be any tension is unrealistic. ""But I'm hoping we can see stability in the relationship with the US and Europe. That would be good for everyone.""

"Oil prices have receded, after rising following an Iranian attack on two bases hosting US troops in Iraq. Financial markets were also relatively calm despite the conflict, amid investor hopes that the two sides would avoid further escalation. US President Donald Trump said he would seek additional economic sanctions, but he stopped short of calling for military action. The three main share indexes in the US closed the day up about 0.5% or more. While oil prices had jumped to an almost four-month high overnight, they fell back during trade on Wednesday. Brent Crude was down more than 3% to about $65.78 per barrel by mid-day in New York and West Texas International fell more than 4%. Despite that pullback, oil prices remain nearly 25% higher over the last 12 months, due in part to rising tensions in the Middle East. Iranian state television saidthe attack was a retaliation for the killing of the country's top commander Qasem Soleimani. US airbases in Iraq hit by ballistic missiles The US, Iran and Soleimani story explained What is Trump's strategy on Iran? The attack happened just hours after the funeral service for Soleimani, who was killed by a US drone strike on Friday. His death had raised concerns that the conflict between the US and Iran could escalate further. That could disrupt shipping in the world's busiest sea route for oil,the Strait of Hormuz. Around a fifth of global oil supply passes through the strait which connects the Gulf with the Arabian Sea. The Strait of Hormuz is vital for the main oil exporters in the Gulf region - Saudi Arabia, Iraq, the UAE, and Kuwait - whose economies are built around oil and gas production. Iran also relies heavily on this route for its oil exports. Qatar, the world's biggest producer of liquefied natural gas (LNG), exports nearly all its gas through the strait. After the latest attacks, the US aviation regulator banned American airlines from flying over Iraq, Iran and neighbouring countries. The ban includes the Gulf of Oman and the waters between Iran and Saudi Arabia. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said the decision was in response to heightened military activity, and increased political tension in the region. Before the latest guidance, the FAA had already prohibited US airlines from flying below 26,000 feet (7,925 metres) over Iraq and from flying over an area of Iranian airspace above the Gulf of Oman since Iran shot down an American drone in June 2019. At the same time Singapore Airlines has said that all of its flights would now be diverted from Iranian airspace.

"McDonald's boss Chris Kempczinski in 2018 Two senior McDonald's executives have filed a lawsuit against the company, accusing it of discriminating against African-American customers and staff. They say the climate grew especially hostile after UK-born Steve Easterbrook became chief executive in 2015. Under his leadership, they say the firm ""conducted a ruthless purge"" of high-ranked African-Americans and shifted advertising away from black customers. McDonald's said: ""We disagree with characterisations in the complaint"". The firm said it has reduced the number of ""officer level"" positions over the last five years but that people of colour account for 45% of the firm's corporate officers - an increase since 2013 - and all of its 10 field vice-presidents in the US. Last year, it launcheda marketing campaign aimed at African Americans,externalthat was its largest in 16 years, it added. ""At McDonald's our actions are rooted in our belief that a diverse, vibrant, inclusive and respectful company makes us stronger,"" the company said. Mr Easterbrook, who is named in the complaint, was fired last yearfor a mutual romantic relationship with a colleague in violation of company rules. He could not be reached for comment. Mr Easterbrook was replaced by Chris Kempczinski, who previously headed McDonald's US division and is also named in the complaint. McDonald's boss Steve Easterbrook fired after dating employee McDonald's sacks Australian franchisee over race row video Racism in football: Reporting process is 'broken' The lawsuit was filed on Tuesday in federal court in Illinois by Vicki Guster-Hines and Domineca Neal. The two women have worked at McDonald's since 1987 and 2012 respectively and are both vice presidents for franchising and operations. They say McDonald's practised ""systematic but covert"" racial discrimination  ""over the years"" but it became ""overt, unmistakable, non-coincidental and highly damaging"" after the 2015 leadership change. In the complaint, they cite the shelving of training programmes for African Americans, the exclusion of African Americans from the ranks of senior advisors, and descriptions of colleagues as ""Angry Black Women"". They say that the number of black-owned franchises also declined disproportionately - departures they argue were either ""intentional"" or due to the company's ""reckless disregard"" for the cost of some of the investments it demanded of franchise owners. They also accuse the firm, which has been pursuing a broader campaign to refurbish stores and upgrade its image, of shifting advertising away from black customers, historically some of the company's strongest patrons. ""As a consumer block, African Americans were singled out as less desired by McDonald's,"" they say. The two women are seeking damages from the firm, which they say retaliated against them for voicing their concerns about the treatment of African Americans.

"This video can not be played Figen Murray says she is ""over the moon"" Manchester will be the first to adopt tougher security checks Clubs and venues in Manchester will be asked to adopt new anti-terror measures following a campaign by the mother of arena bomb victim Martyn Hett. The 29-year-old was one of 22 people killed in the suicide bombing in 2017. His mother Figen Murray has been lobbying the government to bring in Martyn's Law, which would see venues make tougher security checks. Manchester City Council is aiming to be the first to bring in the changes by adopting new licensing rules. Ms Murray said: ""I am absolutely over the moon with [the council] because obviously it is not a legal requirement yet - they have said voluntarily they are going to kick-start it. ""To me it's massive because I have been working so hard with a lot of other wonderful people on this."" Martyn Hett was one of 22 people killed in the attack on 22 May 2017 Ms Murray said she hoped other cities would follow suit. She said: ""Across the road from my house I have a tree planted in Martyn's memory. ""I went there on 1 January at 8am while everybody was asleep and I said to Martyn, 'this is the year I am going to try and implement Martyn's Law. I will do my best for you Martyn'. ""As a mother what else can I do?"" Councillors will be asked on Wednesday to approve a review of the way the council licenses premises, although initially its implementation would be voluntary. The existing range of licensing conditions would be revised to incorporate specific counter-terrorism measures such as ensuring venues have a plan in place and staff training. Without legislation, licensed venues cannot be compelled to implement Martyn's Law but the council said it may impose counter-terrorism conditions on new licences or where a licence is being varied. It said any revised conditions could be introduced this year following a short public consultation. However, to include anti-terrorism measures into the formal Licensing Policy could not happen until January 2021. Council deputy leader Nigel Murphy said: ""We are proud to work with Figen to lead the way on bringing in an improved culture of safety in this country, but we need the government to take action. ""Only they have the power to get Martyn's Law onto the statute books and we hope it treats her campaign as a priority."" A Home Office spokesman said: ""Following the horrendous attacks in 2017 the government is working to make venues and public spaces safer. ""This includes reviewing the law around protective security and preparedness arrangements and whether owners should be legally required to put in place counter-terror measures. ""We welcome the contribution made by Figen Murray and the Martyn's Law campaign to this work."" Mr Hett was killed along with 21 others when a bomb exploded at the end of an Ariana Grande concert at Manchester Arena on 22 May 2017, which also left hundreds injured.

"Thousands of camels in South Australia will be shot dead from helicopters as a result of extreme heat and drought. A five-day cull started on Wednesday, as Aboriginal communities in the region have reported large groups of camels damaging towns and buildings. ""They are roaming the streets looking for water. We are worried about the safety of the young children"", says Marita Baker, who lives in the community of Kanypi. Some feral horses will also be killed. Camels were brought to Australia in the 19th century and have since become feral The marksmen who will shoot the animals come from Australia's department for environment and water. Hot and dry conditions have led to huge bush fires across Australia in the last few months, but the country's drought has lasted for years. The camel cull is not directly linked to the fires crisis. The slaughter will take place in the area of Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara (APY) - a sparsely-populated part of South Australia which is home to a number of indigenous groups. Australia bushfires: A very simple guide ""There is extreme pressure on remote Aboirignal communities in the APY lands and their pastoral [livestock] operations as the camels search for water,"" says APY's general manager Richard King in astatement.,external ""Given ongoing dry conditions and the large camel congregations threatening all of the main APY communities and infrastructure, immediate camel control is needed,"" he adds. ""We have been stuck in stinking hot and uncomfortable conditions, feeling unwell, because all the camels are coming in and knocking down fences, getting in around the houses and trying to get water through air-conditioners,"" says APY Executive Board Member Marita Baker. This video can not be played Australia fires: ""Nothing left"" for animals that survive Camels aren't native to Australia - they were brought over by British settlers from India, Afghanistan and the Middle East in the 19th century. Estimates of numbers of camels vary but there are thought to be hundreds of thousands of them across the central parts of the country. They can damage fences, farm equipment and settlements, and also drink water which is needed by people who live there. They also emit methane, a greenhouse gas which contributes to climate change. The strange story of Australia's camel Firefighters tackle blazes in New South Wales Australian bushfires have left at least 25 people dead since September. About 2,000 homes havebeen destroyed.  The eastern and southern sides of the country have been the worst-affected - and many animals have also been killed in the fires. Australia always has fires at this time of year, but they are a lot worse than normal this season. The country has been getting hotter over recent decades and is expected to continue doing so. Scientists have long warned that this hotter, drier climate will contribute to fires becoming more frequent and more intense. Is climate change to blame for Australia's bushfires?

"Ukraine International Airlines (UIA) has named victims of Wednesday's crash A Ukrainian Boeing 737-800 crashed shortly after take-off in Iran on Wednesday, killing all 176 people on board. In total, 82 Iranians and 63 Canadians were on board the Kyiv-bound Ukraine International Airlines (UIA) Flight PS752, Ukraine's Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko said. There were also 11 victims - including nine crew members - from Ukraine, four Afghans, four Britons and three Germans. Iran's head of emergency operations said 147 of the victims were Iranian, which suggests many of the foreign nationals held dual nationality. A list of passengers was released by the airline, but the BBC is awaiting confirmation from people known to the victims.

"This video can not be played The PM said the government would work to prevent an escalation of violence Boris Johnson has said General Qasem Soleimani, killed by a US drone strike last week, had ""the blood of British troops on his hands"". He told the Commons the Iranian general was also responsible for a string of attacks on innocent civilians but called for ""urgent de-escalation"". He warned Iran not to repeat ""reckless"" attacks after ballistic missiles were fired at Iraqi air bases earlier. Iran's Revolutionary Guard said they were in response to Soleimani's death. It came as President Trump on Wednesdayurged countries including the UK- to send a ""clear and united message"" to Iran that its ""campaign of terror"" will no longer be tolerated. Mr Trump also called on the UK and its other European allies to abandon the nuclear deal it signed with Iran nuclear deal with in 2015. But, at Prime Minister's Questions earlier, Mr Johnson defended the deal, saying it remains the ""best way of preventing nuclear proliferation in Iran"". How much influence does UK have in Iran crisis? Iran nuclear deal crisis in 300 words Is the Iran nuclear deal dead and buried? In his first PMQs since Parliament returned from its Christmas break, Mr Johnson said there were no UK casualties in the attacks on Iraqi air bases ""as far as we can tell"". ""We, of course, condemn the attack on Iraqi military bases hosting coalition forces,"" Mr Johnson said. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn questioned the legality of the drone strike ordered by US President Donald Trump thatkilled Soleimani outside Baghdad airport on Friday. The PM said it was not up the UK to determine whether the strike was legal ""since it was not our operation"", but added: ""I think most reasonable people would accept that the United States has the right to protect its bases and its personnel."" How much influence does UK have in Iran crisis? Iran targets US troops with missile strikes His comments come after Foreign Secretary Dominic Raabrejected the idea that the killing was an act of war. Mr Johnson and President Trump have discussed the air strike on Iraqi bases over the phone. A Downing Street spokesman said the prime minister stressed the need for ""urgent de-escalation to avoid further conflict"". This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn asks Boris Johnson if the killing of General Qasem Soleimani was illegal Mr Johnson told MPs that Soleimani had supplied ""improvised explosive devices to terrorists"" which ""killed and maimed British troops"", adding: ""That man had the blood of British troops on his hands."" Mr Corbyn's spokesman later said it was ""hard to see"" how Soleimani's assassination could be justified as a legal action. ""Since the assassination of senior officials, generals, or ministers of internationally recognised governments is, on the face of it, entirely illegal in international law, that defence - the defence of an imminent threat - has to be made public for there to be any question of there being legality around it,"" the spokesman told a Westminster briefing. He added: ""No such evidence has been forthcoming and, on the face of it, it's hard to see how that would be the case."" It has taken a while to hear from Boris Johnson directly and I suspect that will surprise a lot of people. It's been five days since this crisis erupted and this is the first we've heard from him. He's only talking about it today, frankly, because he has to at PMQs. This is because of a new approach from No 10. They want to delegate more responsibility to other cabinet ministers and not have the PM responding to every event and crisis. But it also reflects the fact that in this post-Brexit world, Mr Johnson is having to perform a very delicate balancing act. On the one hand, he wants to stay close to the Europeans, who we want good relations and a speedy trade deal with. On the other, he doesn't want to antagonise the US, with whom we want similar things. That's why you heard him talking about working solidly with the EU to dial down the conflict but at the same time defending President Trump's right to act as he did. The bottom line is that as Brexit unfolds, Mr Johnson is going to have to get pretty good at this diplomatic high-wire act. Mr Corbyn said US-Iran tensions were in ""real risk"" of developing into ""full-scale war"" and asked the prime minister whether British personnel in the area were safe. Mr Johnson said: ""As far as we can tell there were no casualties last night sustained by the US and no British personnel were injured in the attacks. ""We are doing everything we can to protect UK interests in the region, with HMS Defender and HMS Montrose operating in an enhanced state of readiness to protect shipping in the Gulf."" Mr Johnson will later discuss the situation at a meeting with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Which bases were targeted? Analysis: Is there more to come from Iran? This video can not be played This footage, reportedly of the missile attack, was shown on Iranian state TV Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei describedthe missile attackas ""a slap in the face"" for the US. The strike showed just a ""small part"" of the capabilities of the Iranian armed forces, the chief of staff for the military said. But Iran's ambassador to the UK, Hamid Baeidinejad,said the attack was an act of self-defence,externaland the country ""does not seek escalation or war"". More than a dozen missiles were fired from Iranian territories into Iraq at about 02:00 local time on Wednesday (22:30 GMT on Tuesday). The al Asad airbase - located in the Anbar province of western Iraq - was hit by at least six missiles. Lydia Wilson of the University of Oxford's Centre for the Resolution of Intractable Conflict, called it a ""symbolic"" attack that was not designed to ""really damage"" US or Iraqi military capabilities. Noting that Iran used ballistic missiles rather than more sophisticated cruise missiles, she said: ""Iran was not going to risk a major escalation in this climate. They're very overstretched in the region... they're not going to easily take on the biggest military in the world."" There are about 400 UK troops stationed in Iraq, primarily to assist Iraqi troops in defeating the Islamic State group. A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: ""We are urgently working to establish the facts on the ground. Our first priority continues to be the security of British personnel."" Defence Secretary Ben Wallace added that further ""volatility"" would only benefit terrorist groups ""who will seek to capitalise on instability"". Iraqi security forces gathered pieces of the missiles In the UK, police were ""extremely alert"" to any impact the crisis in Iran may have in Britain, the Metropolitan Police commissioner Cressida Dick has said. On Tuesday, theRoyal Navy and military helicopters were put on standbyin the Gulf amid the rising tensions in the Middle East. The government said non-essential UK personnel had also been moved out of the Iraqi capital Baghdad. Iran had vowed ""severe revenge"" following the assassination of Soleimani. The general - who controlled Iran's proxy forces across the Middle East - was regarded as a terrorist by the US government. How much influence does UK have in Iran crisis?

"Greggs said its vegan sausage roll had helped boost sales Thousands of Greggs staff are set to get a Â£300 one-off payment after a ""phenomenal year"", the firm said. Sales growth had been helped by strong demand for its traditional snacks and Greggs' ""now iconic"" vegan sausage rolls, the bakery chain said. Greggs staff will share a Â£7m payment after shareholders received a Â£35m special dividend in October. The firm expects underlying annual pre-tax profit to be ahead of its expectations when it reports in March. The 19,000 Greggs staff who have been with the chain since before 31 March will get a Â£300 windfall at the end of January, while the remaining 6,000 will get Â£75 for each quarter they have worked for Greggs. The one-off payment to staff will be on top of the profit-sharing scheme that Greggs already has, a spokeswoman said. The bakery chain already shares 10% of profits with employees, she said. ""Our record financial performance in 2019 has enabled us to enhance returns to shareholders,"" said chief executive Roger Whiteside. ""I am delighted to announce that we will also be making a special additional payment to all of our colleagues across the business who have worked so hard to deliver this success in what has been a phenomenal year."" Greggs stockpiles pork for sausage rolls ahead of Brexit Greggs to trial late-night opening hours Greggs vegan sausage roll boosts sales The bonus comes a year after Greggs launched its vegan sausage roll snack, which is made from meat substitute Quorn. Its launch has been followed by other initiatives such as a vegan steak bake and a vegan doughnut. James Compton, Victor Connor, and Stephen Green (left to right) all qualify for the full Â£300 bonus When store manager Victor Connor and workers James Compton and Stephen Green heard about the bonus they started screaming and shouting. ""It genuinely feels like a thank you,"" Victor said. ""Quite a few customers have said: 'To be fair you guys deserve it'."" Stephen said it was particularly welcome just after Christmas: ""They don't need to give it us, something for all our hard work."" ""But it makes the staff feel more appreciated- everyone here is made up,"" he added. It isn't uncommon for workers to benefit from a share in the profits. Other UK retailers that have staff bonus schemes include John Lewis and Waitrose, Sainsbury's, and Sports Direct for shop floor workers. Maureen Hinton, global retail research director at GlobalData, said offering a staff bonus reflected a growing trend amongst firms to want to appear ethical. ""This is a great way for Greggs to maintain the loyalty of the workforce and creates a very inclusive culture, as the benefits of its success is being shared with everyone. It was also good ""PR"" she added ""something Greggs is excellent at."" Greggs, like other retailers, will face higher costs in 2020 from a boost to the National Living Wage and higher pork prices, the firm added. Greggs opened 138 new shops over the last year and closed 41, bringing the total to 2,050 across the UK. It said it planned to open about 100 new shops in 2020. Like-for-like sales grew 9.2% in 2019, compared with 2.9% growth in 2018.

"This video can not be played EU chief Ursula von der Leyen says the UK and the EU will remain ""best of friends and partners"" The UK and the EU will remain the ""best of friends"" but they will ""not be as close as before"" after Brexit, the new European Commission president has said. Speaking ahead of talks with the PM, Ursula von der Leyen warned it would be ""impossible"" to reach a comprehensive trade deal by the end of 2020. She said if the deadline was not extended it was not a case of ""all or nothing"", but of priorities. Boris Johnson has insisted a deal is possible by December 2020. After their meeting in No 10, a Downing Street spokesman said talks had been ""positive"", but the PM had been ""clear"" the process of negotiation would not be extended. After its 31 January exit, the UK will enter into an 11-month transition period in which it will largely follow EU rules but will not have any representation in the bloc's institutions. This period will come to an end on 31 December. Only when the UK leaves the EU can the two sides begin talks on their future economic relationship. Mr Johnson told Mrs von der Leyen he ""wanted a positive new UK and EU partnership, based on friendly co-operation, our shared history, interests and values"", as well as a ""broad free trade agreement covering goods and services, and cooperation in other areas"". He also said the UK was ready to start negotiations ""as soon as possible"" after 31 January. MPs resume scrutiny of PM's Brexit bill What's happening with Brexit this week? Who is Ursula von der Leyen? MSPs set to reject UK Brexit legislation Speaking at the London School of Economics earlier in the day, Mrs von der Leyen said the EU was ""ready to negotiate a truly ambitions partnership with UK"" but she warned of ""tough"" talks ahead. ""We will go as far as we can, but the truth is that our partnership cannot and will not be the same as before and it cannot and will not be as close as before because with every choice comes a consequences with every decision comes a trade off."" Ursula von der Leyen met Boris Johnson in Number 10 Mrs von der Leyen, a former German defence minister, took over from Jean-Claude Juncker at the start of December. She was a student at the LSE in the 1970s. She also attended the same school as Mr Johnson in Belgium - something the prime minister highlighted as they posed for photos in Number 10. Mrs von der Leyen said she hoped the new trading relationship would be based on ""zero tariffs, zero quotas, zero dumping"". What is the transition period? Week ahead in Parliament But she said: ""Without the free movement of people you cannot have the free movement of capital and services. ""The more divergence there is the more distant the partnership will be."" Mrs von der Leyen also warned that without an extension of the transition period beyond 2020  ""you cannot expect to agree every single aspect of our new partnership"". She called the deadline ""very tight"". This video can not be played Barclay: 'Let's be positive' about 2020 Brexit trade deal deadline Opposition MPs have warned that trade deals typically take years to conclude and the UK risks defaulting to World Trade Organisation rules at the start of 2021, potentially leading to damaging tariffs for some industries. But Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay told BBC Breakfast the UK and EU had agreed in the political declaration to do a trade deal by the end of this year and he was ""confident"" they would do that. The meeting between Boris Johnson and new European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is significant in that it's their first face-to-face in their new roles - but today does not mark the start of post-Brexit trade talks. EU law dictates that trade talks can't start until the UK legally leaves the bloc. Then EU countries must agree a mandate for the EU Commission to negotiate a comprehensive trade agreement on their behalf. This mandate then has to be formally signed off at minister level by representatives of all EU countries. All this means, the EU says, is trade talks will start at the beginning of March. When UK ministers complain that's too long to wait, the EU response is that the UK always pushed for bigger role for national governments in EU decision-making to make it more democratic. Expect red-line drawing with smiles today between the prime minister and Mrs von der Leyen - presented as ""friends telling each other truths"". The EU position is that the prime minister's timetable to get an ""ambitious, comprehensive"" trade deal agreed and ratified by December is unrealistic. However, the prime minister will counter this with ""truths"" of his own, including that negotiations have to be done by December because he won't extend the transition period. Legislation implementing the terms of Mr Johnson's Brexit deal continues to move through the Commons, with the government easily winning all three votes on the Withdrawal Agreement Bill on Tuesday. The bill will enshrine in law the terms of the transition period, first negotiated by Mr Johnson's predecessor Theresa May, as well as agreements on citizens' rights, customs arrangements in Northern Ireland and the UK's financial settlement. Attempts by Northern Ireland parties to amend the bill to ensure ""unfettered access"" for businesses there to the rest of the UK market failed to pass on Wednesday afternoon. MPs also rejected an attempt by Labourto reinstate child refugee protection rights in the Brexit bill.

"Thousands of camels in South Australia will be shot dead from helicopters as a result of extreme heat and drought. A five-day cull started on Wednesday, as Aboriginal communities in the region have reported large groups of camels damaging towns and buildings. ""They are roaming the streets looking for water. We are worried about the safety of the young children"", says Marita Baker, who lives in the community of Kanypi. Some feral horses will also be killed. Camels were brought to Australia in the 19th century and have since become feral The marksmen who will shoot the animals come from Australia's department for environment and water. Hot and dry conditions have led to huge bush fires across Australia in the last few months, but the country's drought has lasted for years. The camel cull is not directly linked to the fires crisis. The slaughter will take place in the area of Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara (APY) - a sparsely-populated part of South Australia which is home to a number of indigenous groups. Australia bushfires: A very simple guide ""There is extreme pressure on remote Aboirignal communities in the APY lands and their pastoral [livestock] operations as the camels search for water,"" says APY's general manager Richard King in astatement.,external ""Given ongoing dry conditions and the large camel congregations threatening all of the main APY communities and infrastructure, immediate camel control is needed,"" he adds. ""We have been stuck in stinking hot and uncomfortable conditions, feeling unwell, because all the camels are coming in and knocking down fences, getting in around the houses and trying to get water through air-conditioners,"" says APY Executive Board Member Marita Baker. This video can not be played Australia fires: ""Nothing left"" for animals that survive Camels aren't native to Australia - they were brought over by British settlers from India, Afghanistan and the Middle East in the 19th century.

"This video can not be played The PM said the government would work to prevent an escalation of violence Boris Johnson has said General Qasem Soleimani, killed by a US drone strike last week, had ""the blood of British troops on his hands"". He told the Commons the Iranian general was also responsible for a string of attacks on innocent civilians but called for ""urgent de-escalation"". He warned Iran not to repeat ""reckless"" attacks after ballistic missiles were fired at Iraqi air bases earlier. Iran's Revolutionary Guard said they were in response to Soleimani's death. It came as President Trump on Wednesdayurged countries including the UK- to send a ""clear and united message"" to Iran that its ""campaign of terror"" will no longer be tolerated. Mr Trump also called on the UK and its other European allies to abandon the nuclear deal it signed with Iran nuclear deal with in 2015. But, at Prime Minister's Questions earlier, Mr Johnson defended the deal, saying it remains the ""best way of preventing nuclear proliferation in Iran"". How much influence does UK have in Iran crisis? Iran nuclear deal crisis in 300 words Is the Iran nuclear deal dead and buried? In his first PMQs since Parliament returned from its Christmas break, Mr Johnson said there were no UK casualties in the attacks on Iraqi air bases ""as far as we can tell"". ""We, of course, condemn the attack on Iraqi military bases hosting coalition forces,"" Mr Johnson said. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn questioned the legality of the drone strike ordered by US President Donald Trump thatkilled Soleimani outside Baghdad airport on Friday. The PM said it was not up the UK to determine whether the strike was legal ""since it was not our operation"", but added: ""I think most reasonable people would accept that the United States has the right to protect its bases and its personnel."" How much influence does UK have in Iran crisis? Iran targets US troops with missile strikes His comments come after Foreign Secretary Dominic Raabrejected the idea that the killing was an act of war. Mr Johnson and President Trump have discussed the air strike on Iraqi bases over the phone. A Downing Street spokesman said the prime minister stressed the need for ""urgent de-escalation to avoid further conflict"". This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn asks Boris Johnson if the killing of General Qasem Soleimani was illegal Mr Johnson told MPs that Soleimani had supplied ""improvised explosive devices to terrorists"" which ""killed and maimed British troops"", adding: ""That man had the blood of British troops on his hands."" Mr Corbyn's spokesman later said it was ""hard to see"" how Soleimani's assassination could be justified as a legal action. ""Since the assassination of senior officials, generals, or ministers of internationally recognised governments is, on the face of it, entirely illegal in international law, that defence - the defence of an imminent threat - has to be made public for there to be any question of there being legality around it,"" the spokesman told a Westminster briefing. He added: ""No such evidence has been forthcoming and, on the face of it, it's hard to see how that would be the case."" It has taken a while to hear from Boris Johnson directly and I suspect that will surprise a lot of people. It's been five days since this crisis erupted and this is the first we've heard from him. He's only talking about it today, frankly, because he has to at PMQs. This is because of a new approach from No 10. They want to delegate more responsibility to other cabinet ministers and not have the PM responding to every event and crisis. But it also reflects the fact that in this post-Brexit world, Mr Johnson is having to perform a very delicate balancing act. On the one hand, he wants to stay close to the Europeans, who we want good relations and a speedy trade deal with. On the other, he doesn't want to antagonise the US, with whom we want similar things. That's why you heard him talking about working solidly with the EU to dial down the conflict but at the same time defending President Trump's right to act as he did. The bottom line is that as Brexit unfolds, Mr Johnson is going to have to get pretty good at this diplomatic high-wire act. Mr Corbyn said US-Iran tensions were in ""real risk"" of developing into ""full-scale war"" and asked the prime minister whether British personnel in the area were safe. Mr Johnson said: ""As far as we can tell there were no casualties last night sustained by the US and no British personnel were injured in the attacks. ""We are doing everything we can to protect UK interests in the region, with HMS Defender and HMS Montrose operating in an enhanced state of readiness to protect shipping in the Gulf."" Mr Johnson will later discuss the situation at a meeting with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Which bases were targeted? Analysis: Is there more to come from Iran? This video can not be played This footage, reportedly of the missile attack, was shown on Iranian state TV Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei describedthe missile attackas ""a slap in the face"" for the US. The strike showed just a ""small part"" of the capabilities of the Iranian armed forces, the chief of staff for the military said. But Iran's ambassador to the UK, Hamid Baeidinejad,said the attack was an act of self-defence,externaland the country ""does not seek escalation or war"". More than a dozen missiles were fired from Iranian territories into Iraq at about 02:00 local time on Wednesday (22:30 GMT on Tuesday). The al Asad airbase - located in the Anbar province of western Iraq - was hit by at least six missiles. Lydia Wilson of the University of Oxford's Centre for the Resolution of Intractable Conflict, called it a ""symbolic"" attack that was not designed to ""really damage"" US or Iraqi military capabilities. Noting that Iran used ballistic missiles rather than more sophisticated cruise missiles, she said: ""Iran was not going to risk a major escalation in this climate. They're very overstretched in the region... they're not going to easily take on the biggest military in the world."" There are about 400 UK troops stationed in Iraq, primarily to assist Iraqi troops in defeating the Islamic State group. A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: ""We are urgently working to establish the facts on the ground. Our first priority continues to be the security of British personnel."" Defence Secretary Ben Wallace added that further ""volatility"" would only benefit terrorist groups ""who will seek to capitalise on instability"". Iraqi security forces gathered pieces of the missiles In the UK, police were ""extremely alert"" to any impact the crisis in Iran may have in Britain, the Metropolitan Police commissioner Cressida Dick has said. On Tuesday, theRoyal Navy and military helicopters were put on standbyin the Gulf amid the rising tensions in the Middle East. The government said non-essential UK personnel had also been moved out of the Iraqi capital Baghdad. Iran had vowed ""severe revenge"" following the assassination of Soleimani. The general - who controlled Iran's proxy forces across the Middle East - was regarded as a terrorist by the US government. How much influence does UK have in Iran crisis?

"Thousands of camels in South Australia will be shot dead from helicopters as a result of extreme heat and drought. A five-day cull started on Wednesday, as Aboriginal communities in the region have reported large groups of camels damaging towns and buildings. ""They are roaming the streets looking for water. We are worried about the safety of the young children"", says Marita Baker, who lives in the community of Kanypi. Some feral horses will also be killed. Camels were brought to Australia in the 19th century and have since become feral The marksmen who will shoot the animals come from Australia's department for environment and water. Hot and dry conditions have led to huge bush fires across Australia in the last few months, but the country's drought has lasted for years. The camel cull is not directly linked to the fires crisis. The slaughter will take place in the area of Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara (APY) - a sparsely-populated part of South Australia which is home to a number of indigenous groups. Australia bushfires: A very simple guide ""There is extreme pressure on remote Aboirignal communities in the APY lands and their pastoral [livestock] operations as the camels search for water,"" says APY's general manager Richard King in astatement.,external ""Given ongoing dry conditions and the large camel congregations threatening all of the main APY communities and infrastructure, immediate camel control is needed,"" he adds. ""We have been stuck in stinking hot and uncomfortable conditions, feeling unwell, because all the camels are coming in and knocking down fences, getting in around the houses and trying to get water through air-conditioners,"" says APY Executive Board Member Marita Baker.

"More than a third of all homicides in the UK in 2019 were as a result of a fatal stabbing The number of people killed across the UK fell in 2019 for the first time in five years, BBC research suggests. In total, 650 people were killed in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland last year - down from the 774 homicides in 2018, police figures show. Despite the drop, homicides in London rose for a third successive calendar year - to the highest level since 2008. It comes a week after the home secretary gave 18 police forces Â£35m to combat violence. Throughout 2019, the BBC recorded details of murder and manslaughter investigations launched by the 46 UK police forces. Homicide figures fell for 26 of those forces while five recorded the same figure as in 2018. In London - one of the areas to see a notable increase and where the number of killings was highest - the Metropolitan Police launched 149 homicide investigations. The British Transport Police ledthree murder investigations on the London Underground networkand Jack Merritt and Saskia Jones were both stabbed to death in theCity of London on 29 November.

""Therefore, we will continue to target those who, for the sole purpose of financial gain, exploit children and target the most vulnerable within our communities. ""However, the causes of violence are complex and police cannot solve it alone. ""Solutions will require a holistic and sustainable approach that will involve a range of action from government, education, health, social services, housing, youth services and the public."" According to BBC research, the majority of UK police forces saw a fall in homicides compared with 2018. West Midlands Police said the number fell from 51 in 2018 to 39 last year; while homicides in Greater Manchester were down from 64 to 39. In Merseyside the homicide level halved, down from 21 to 10, while West Yorkshire Police launched 21 homicide investigations in 2019 compared with 39 in 2018. Merseyside Police's Assistant Chief Constable Ian Critchley said this was down to a ""relentless suppression"" of serious organised crime and also reducing the number of domestic violence killings. ""At the other end, it is about stopping young people getting into crime in the first place,"" he said. ""We will target relentlessly people who feel they can control what is taking place in order to obtain money and use bullying, cowardly tactics to groom young people to carry knives and firearms."" Elsewhere in England, Essex saw a notable increase from 13 homicides in 2018 to 54 homicides last year - but the figure does include the39 Vietnamese nationals which were found in the back of a lorry in Grays in October.

Northern Ireland saw 26 homicides - two more than 2018 - and PSNI's Det Supt Jason Murphy explained that many homicides in Northern Ireland were ""complex"" and had varied factors compared with other UK regions. Det Supt Murphy, who is leading themurder investigation into the fatal shooting of journalist Lyra McKee, said Northern Ireland had far more ""terrorist-related"" homicides than the rest of UK - but also fewer killings linked to county lines and organised crime.

"London MP Sir Keir Starmer is a former director of public prosecutions Sir Keir Starmer has won the backing of the UK's largest trade union, Unison, to become the next Labour leader. Unison, which has 1.3 million members, said the shadow Brexit secretary was best placed of the candidates to unite the party and regain public trust. Unite, Labour's largest financial backer, will decide later this month who to back in the contest. Sir Keir has also become the first to secure enough nominations from MPs,externaland MEPs to get on the ballot paper. The Holborn and St Pancras MP has, so far, secured the backing of 41 colleagues - well above the minimum of 22 required. Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long Bailey is his closest competitor, followed by Jess Phillips. Nominations close on 13 January and the winner will be announced on 4 April following a ballot of party members, trade union and other affiliates and registered supporters. Who will be Labour's next leader? New Labour leader to be announced on 4 April Corbyn won't endorse any leadership contenders As the contest gathers pace, BBC Newsnight correspondent Lewis Goodall reported that Barry Gardiner, the party's international trade spokesman, could become a candidate. The Brent North MP has yet to confirm this. Unison's endorsement, which was agreed by a committee of ""working people from across the country"", is a major boost for Sir Keir's campaign. Announcing its decision, the union said it believed the former director of public prosecutions was capable of taking Labour back into government. General Secretary Dave Prentis said working people depended on Labour being in power to change their lives. ""We believe - if elected by the membership - Keir Starmer would be a leader to bring the party together and win back the trust of the thousands of voters who deserted Labour last month,"" he said. ""Keir has a clear vision to get Labour back to the winning ways of the past. He is best placed to take on Boris Johnson, hold his government to account and ensure Labour can return to power."" The union, which represents workers across the NHS, schools and other public services, backed Jeremy Corbyn in 2015 and 2016. The BBC's political correspondent Iain Watson said Sir Keir was the overwhelming choice of the union's Link Committee, having won more support than all of the other candidates combined. This video can not be played Who decides on the next Labour leader? He has also recruited Simon Fletcher to his campaign team - Jeremy Corbyn's former chief of staff who ran his successful leadership bid in 2015. Mrs Long Bailey has Momentum founder Jon Lansman as her campaign director and former spokesman for Mr Corbyn, Matt Zarb-Cousin, as her director of communications. Sir Keir told the BBC he was ""delighted"" by the endorsement but played down talk of him now being the frontrunner, telling the BBC ""there was a long way to go"" in the contest. ""What I want to do is lead a united Labour Party that works with trade unions to bring them together to face the future,"" he said. It caps a good day for the shadow Brexit secretary, whose growing number of parliamentary backers include former foreign secretary Margaret Beckett, the new shadow culture secretary Tracy Brabin and Tottenham MP David Lammy. Mrs Long Bailey's 17 backers include shadow home secretary Diane Abbott, while Birmingham Yardley MP Jess Phillips has the support of 16 colleagues, including Wes Streeting and Margaret Hodge - outspoken critics of Mr Corbyn over his handling of anti-Semitism allegations. Wigan MP Lisa Nandy has 11 nominations, while shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry has three. Shadow Treasury minister Clive Lewis has secured his first nomination from Rachael Maskell. Earlier, Mr Lewis rated Mr Corbyn ""six out of 10"" as leader of the Labour Party. Speaking to the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme, he criticised the outgoing leader for making mistakes on Brexit and dealing with anti-Semitism. ""But some things he got right,"" Mr Lewis added, ""so in many ways he's renewed our party.""The comments follow those of Mrs Long Bailey, who rated Mr Corbyn 10 out of 10 for his performance as leader, despite Labour's electoral defeat.

"Thousands of camels in South Australia will be shot dead from helicopters as a result of extreme heat and drought. A five-day cull started on Wednesday, as Aboriginal communities in the region have reported large groups of camels damaging towns and buildings. ""They are roaming the streets looking for water.

"This video can not be played EU chief Ursula von der Leyen says the UK and the EU will remain ""best of friends and partners"" The UK and the EU will remain the ""best of friends"" but they will ""not be as close as before"" after Brexit, the new European Commission president has said. Speaking ahead of talks with the PM, Ursula von der Leyen warned it would be ""impossible"" to reach a comprehensive trade deal by the end of 2020. She said if the deadline was not extended it was not a case of ""all or nothing"", but of priorities. Boris Johnson has insisted a deal is possible by December 2020. After their meeting in No 10, a Downing Street spokesman said talks had been ""positive"", but the PM had been ""clear"" the process of negotiation would not be extended. After its 31 January exit, the UK will enter into an 11-month transition period in which it will largely follow EU rules but will not have any representation in the bloc's institutions. This period will come to an end on 31 December. Only when the UK leaves the EU can the two sides begin talks on their future economic relationship. Mr Johnson told Mrs von der Leyen he ""wanted a positive new UK and EU partnership, based on friendly co-operation, our shared history, interests and values"", as well as a ""broad free trade agreement covering goods and services, and cooperation in other areas"". He also said the UK was ready to start negotiations ""as soon as possible"" after 31 January. MPs resume scrutiny of PM's Brexit bill What's happening with Brexit this week? Who is Ursula von der Leyen? MSPs set to reject UK Brexit legislation Speaking at the London School of Economics earlier in the day, Mrs von der Leyen said the EU was ""ready to negotiate a truly ambitions partnership with UK"" but she warned of ""tough"" talks ahead. ""We will go as far as we can, but the truth is that our partnership cannot and will not be the same as before and it cannot and will not be as close as before because with every choice comes a consequences with every decision comes a trade off."" Ursula von der Leyen met Boris Johnson in Number 10 Mrs von der Leyen, a former German defence minister, took over from Jean-Claude Juncker at the start of December. She was a student at the LSE in the 1970s. She also attended the same school as Mr Johnson in Belgium - something the prime minister highlighted as they posed for photos in Number 10. Mrs von der Leyen said she hoped the new trading relationship would be based on ""zero tariffs, zero quotas, zero dumping"". What is the transition period? Week ahead in Parliament But she said: ""Without the free movement of people you cannot have the free movement of capital and services. ""The more divergence there is the more distant the partnership will be."" Mrs von der Leyen also warned that without an extension of the transition period beyond 2020  ""you cannot expect to agree every single aspect of our new partnership"". She called the deadline ""very tight"". This video can not be played Barclay: 'Let's be positive' about 2020 Brexit trade deal deadline Opposition MPs have warned that trade deals typically take years to conclude and the UK risks defaulting to World Trade Organisation rules at the start of 2021, potentially leading to damaging tariffs for some industries. But Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay told BBC Breakfast the UK and EU had agreed in the political declaration to do a trade deal by the end of this year and he was ""confident"" they would do that. The meeting between Boris Johnson and new European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is significant in that it's their first face-to-face in their new roles - but today does not mark the start of post-Brexit trade talks. EU law dictates that trade talks can't start until the UK legally leaves the bloc. Then EU countries must agree a mandate for the EU Commission to negotiate a comprehensive trade agreement on their behalf. This mandate then has to be formally signed off at minister level by representatives of all EU countries. All this means, the EU says, is trade talks will start at the beginning of March. When UK ministers complain that's too long to wait, the EU response is that the UK always pushed for bigger role for national governments in EU decision-making to make it more democratic. Expect red-line drawing with smiles today between the prime minister and Mrs von der Leyen - presented as ""friends telling each other truths"". The EU position is that the prime minister's timetable to get an ""ambitious, comprehensive"" trade deal agreed and ratified by December is unrealistic. However, the prime minister will counter this with ""truths"" of his own, including that negotiations have to be done by December because he won't extend the transition period. Legislation implementing the terms of Mr Johnson's Brexit deal continues to move through the Commons, with the government easily winning all three votes on the Withdrawal Agreement Bill on Tuesday. The bill will enshrine in law the terms of the transition period, first negotiated by Mr Johnson's predecessor Theresa May, as well as agreements on citizens' rights, customs arrangements in Northern Ireland and the UK's financial settlement. Attempts by Northern Ireland parties to amend the bill to ensure ""unfettered access"" for businesses there to the rest of the UK market failed to pass on Wednesday afternoon. MPs also rejected an attempt by Labourto reinstate child refugee protection rights in the Brexit bill.

"PM's Brexit bill faced final-stage vote in the Commons Bill given approval by 330 votes to 231 - a majority of 99 Approved bill to move to House of Lords for further consideration Paul Seddon and Emma Harrison The Northern Ireland Assembly is set to be restored, but what caused power-sharing to collapse in the first place? And following on the heels of that news, Lisa Nandy's team has also confirmed she's received the necessary nominations as well. ""I am so proud to have been nominated by a group of MPs representing different parts of the country and different traditions in our movement,"" the Wigan MP says. According to the Labour website,external, shadow business secretary Rebecca Long Bailey has also passed the threshold of 22 MP and MEP nominations as well. Among the declared runners, that just leaves Clive Lewis and Emily Thornberry looking to secure enough support from colleagues to stand. Jess Phillips has become the second Labour leadership hopeful to secure the 22 MP and MEP nominations required to make it onto the ballot. The first contender to do so, Sir Keir Starmer, has secured the most nominations so far. Candidates must also secure nominations from at least 5% of Labour's constituency parties or three affiliated bodies - two of which must be trade unions. SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford is quick to react to the result of the vote, which he calls an ""historic moment"". He says the SNP ""cannot accept what has been done to us,"" with the UK leaving the EU despite Scotland voting to remain. Lib Dem Brexit spokesman Alistair
Carmichael has put out a statement saying the bill is ""damaging"" and describing the government as ""inhumane and insular"". He says his party will continue to fight the government ""to secure the rights that the Tories are determined to erase"" as the bill goes through Parliament. House of CommonsParliament By 330 votes to 231, MPs vote to give their final approval the Brexit bill - the legislation required to implement the government's Brexit deal with the EU. The bill will now go to the House of Lords for further scrutiny next week. It will only come back to the Commons for another vote if the Lords decide to amend it. House of CommonsParliament MPs are now voting on whether to pass the bill atthird
reading,external, its final Commons stage. For the past three days MPs have been scrutinising the bill. A
number of amendments were suggested, but all of them were either defeated or
not put to a vote. So MPs are voting on the latest version of the bill as drafted
by the government after the election, which wasunveiled last month. House of CommonsParliament MPs have voted against the SNP's proposal to reject the government's Brexit bill by 329 votes to 62. House of CommonsParliament The debate on the Brexit bill comes to an end. MPs will shortly vote on whether to approve the bill at third reading, at which point it will go to the House of Lords. First, though, they are now voting on an SNP amendment to reject the bill entirely. The company had warned it could move wing-building out of the UK in the event of no deal. House of CommonsParliament Labour MP Fleur Anderson calls Brexit a âmonumental act of self-harmâ. The newly elected MP for Putney, south-west London, says there are NHS workers who are ""struggling to cope with work"" now some EU staff have left the country. ""We know the risks. We know that Brexit wonât be done for many years to come,"" she says. Ms Anderson says there was an increase in reports of racist attacks following the 2016 EU referendum. ""There are high risks that racism and discrimination will be given permission by this bill,"" she says. ""I've seen it happen, it happened straight after the referendum and it's happened since. ""So it's very important to say here in this place that we may be leaving the EU but we're proud of our place in Europe and the world."" House of CommonsParliament Conservative MP Owen Paterson warns the Lords not to delay the government's Brexit bill. The peers will consider the bill next week if, as expected, the Commons approves the legislation today. Mr Paterson says the Lords ""should respect four massive votes by the people"". ""I do hope the other place has watched what has happened,"" he says, referring to the speed at which the bill has travelled through the Commons. ""There is a very clear, determined goal which is to honour those votes, honour the result of the general election and to ensure that we leave the European at 23:00 on the evening of 31 January."" Having won the chance to introduce a private members' bill, MPs still face a number of hurdles. The things you need to know about Brexit this week, with four weeks to go until the UK leaves the EU. House of CommonsParliament Referring to the length of the transition period, which finishes at the end of this year, SNP MP Philippa Whitford tells the Commons that 11 months is a ""ridiculously short time to negotiate even a basic
free trade deal"". After its 31 January exit, the UK will enter into an 11-month transition period in which it will largely follow EU rules but will not have any representation in the bloc's institutions. This period will come to an end on 31 December. Ms Whitford says the government ""sought no common ground whatsoever"" from the nations, ""despite the fact two of them voted to Remain"" in 2016. She says that last night the Scottish governmentvoted 92 to 29 to withhold legislative consent to this bill. ""Ignoring this voiceâ¦ will undermine the very union the
members opposite protest to hold dear,"" she adds.  House of CommonsParliament Conservative MP Sir John Hayes tells MPs that ""any further hesitation"" over Brexit ""will frankly ring hollow in the ears
of those people"" that voted Leave. ""This bill is the first step, not on a trip to a different
place, but on a return journey - a return journey for this United Kingdom to hope, to patriotism
and to greatness."" House of CommonsParliament Labour's shadow Brexit minister Paul Blomfield tells MPs that the decision of the general election ""isnât a
mandate to bulldoze through a particular version of Brexit at any cost on all
the peoples of the UK, and the next few months need to be approached with
sensitivity and caution if we are to stay together as a United Kingdom"". He also calls yesterday's rejection ofan attempt by Labour to reinstate child refugee protection rightsin the Brexit bill a ""heartless move"". House of CommonsParliament MPs have now moved on to debating the governmentâs Brexit
withdrawal bill, which will be put to a vote at third reading stage later. If approved as expected, it will go to the House of Lords
next week for further scrutiny. All amendments tabled so far â including a Labour one on theprotection of child refugeesâ have either been defeated by the government or
not pushed to a vote. The only amendment being debated today is an SNP proposal to reject the
bill in its entirety, which stands no chance of being approved because of the governmentâs
80-seat majority. House of CommonsParliament Minister Heather Wheeler says both the prime minister and foreign secretary have expressed a ""readiness to help"" Australia over the ""devastating"" crisis. An expert ""support and assessment"" team will meet Australian officials within the coming days, she says. They will examine what support would be of most use to the Australian authorities, she adds. House of CommonsParliament The SNP's Hannah Bardell says she will be reporting Lord Maginnis to the police for ""homophobic"" comments he made about her in the press. The Ulster Unionist peer was quoted as calling her ""queer"" and accusing her of attempting to ""settle a score"" after she raised claims of abusive behaviour towards parliamentary staff. ""I and others consider this to be a hate crime,"" she says. Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg describes Lord Maginnisâs comments as âunutterably disgracefulâ and calls on him to apologise.

"Greggs said its vegan sausage roll had helped boost sales Thousands of Greggs staff are set to get a Â£300 one-off payment after a ""phenomenal year"", the firm said. Sales growth had been helped by strong demand for its traditional snacks and Greggs' ""now iconic"" vegan sausage rolls, the bakery chain said. Greggs staff will share a Â£7m payment after shareholders received a Â£35m special dividend in October. The firm expects underlying annual pre-tax profit to be ahead of its expectations when it reports in March. The 19,000 Greggs staff who have been with the chain since before 31 March will get a Â£300 windfall at the end of January, while the remaining 6,000 will get Â£75 for each quarter they have worked for Greggs. The one-off payment to staff will be on top of the profit-sharing scheme that Greggs already has, a spokeswoman said. The bakery chain already shares 10% of profits with employees, she said. ""Our record financial performance in 2019 has enabled us to enhance returns to shareholders,"" said chief executive Roger Whiteside. ""I am delighted to announce that we will also be making a special additional payment to all of our colleagues across the business who have worked so hard to deliver this success in what has been a phenomenal year."" Greggs stockpiles pork for sausage rolls ahead of Brexit Greggs to trial late-night opening hours Greggs vegan sausage roll boosts sales The bonus comes a year after Greggs launched its vegan sausage roll snack, which is made from meat substitute Quorn. Its launch has been followed by other initiatives such as a vegan steak bake and a vegan doughnut. James Compton, Victor Connor, and Stephen Green (left to right) all qualify for the full Â£300 bonus When store manager Victor Connor and workers James Compton and Stephen Green heard about the bonus they started screaming and shouting. ""It genuinely feels like a thank you,"" Victor said. ""Quite a few customers have said: 'To be fair you guys deserve it'."" Stephen said it was particularly welcome just after Christmas: ""They don't need to give it us, something for all our hard work."" ""But it makes the staff feel more appreciated- everyone here is made up,"" he added. It isn't uncommon for workers to benefit from a share in the profits. Other UK retailers that have staff bonus schemes include John Lewis and Waitrose, Sainsbury's, and Sports Direct for shop floor workers. Maureen Hinton, global retail research director at GlobalData, said offering a staff bonus reflected a growing trend amongst firms to want to appear ethical. ""This is a great way for Greggs to maintain the loyalty of the workforce and creates a very inclusive culture, as the benefits of its success is being shared with everyone. It was also good ""PR"" she added ""something Greggs is excellent at."" Greggs, like other retailers, will face higher costs in 2020 from a boost to the National Living Wage and higher pork prices, the firm added. Greggs opened 138 new shops over the last year and closed 41, bringing the total to 2,050 across the UK. It said it planned to open about 100 new shops in 2020. Like-for-like sales grew 9.2% in 2019, compared with 2.9% growth in 2018.

"London MP Sir Keir Starmer is a former director of public prosecutions Sir Keir Starmer has won the backing of the UK's largest trade union, Unison, to become the next Labour leader. Unison, which has 1.3 million members, said the shadow Brexit secretary was best placed of the candidates to unite the party and regain public trust. Unite, Labour's largest financial backer, will decide later this month who to back in the contest. Sir Keir has also become the first to secure enough nominations from MPs,externaland MEPs to get on the ballot paper. The Holborn and St Pancras MP has, so far, secured the backing of 41 colleagues - well above the minimum of 22 required. Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long Bailey is his closest competitor, followed by Jess Phillips. Nominations close on 13 January and the winner will be announced on 4 April following a ballot of party members, trade union and other affiliates and registered supporters. Who will be Labour's next leader? New Labour leader to be announced on 4 April Corbyn won't endorse any leadership contenders As the contest gathers pace, BBC Newsnight correspondent Lewis Goodall reported that Barry Gardiner, the party's international trade spokesman, could become a candidate. The Brent North MP has yet to confirm this. Unison's endorsement, which was agreed by a committee of ""working people from across the country"", is a major boost for Sir Keir's campaign. Announcing its decision, the union said it believed the former director of public prosecutions was capable of taking Labour back into government. General Secretary Dave Prentis said working people depended on Labour being in power to change their lives. ""We believe - if elected by the membership - Keir Starmer would be a leader to bring the party together and win back the trust of the thousands of voters who deserted Labour last month,"" he said. ""Keir has a clear vision to get Labour back to the winning ways of the past. He is best placed to take on Boris Johnson, hold his government to account and ensure Labour can return to power."" The union, which represents workers across the NHS, schools and other public services, backed Jeremy Corbyn in 2015 and 2016. The BBC's political correspondent Iain Watson said Sir Keir was the overwhelming choice of the union's Link Committee, having won more support than all of the other candidates combined. This video can not be played Who decides on the next Labour leader? He has also recruited Simon Fletcher to his campaign team - Jeremy Corbyn's former chief of staff who ran his successful leadership bid in 2015. Mrs Long Bailey has Momentum founder Jon Lansman as her campaign director and former spokesman for Mr Corbyn, Matt Zarb-Cousin, as her director of communications. Sir Keir told the BBC he was ""delighted"" by the endorsement but played down talk of him now being the frontrunner, telling the BBC ""there was a long way to go"" in the contest. ""What I want to do is lead a united Labour Party that works with trade unions to bring them together to face the future,"" he said. It caps a good day for the shadow Brexit secretary, whose growing number of parliamentary backers include former foreign secretary Margaret Beckett, the new shadow culture secretary Tracy Brabin and Tottenham MP David Lammy. Mrs Long Bailey's 17 backers include shadow home secretary Diane Abbott, while Birmingham Yardley MP Jess Phillips has the support of 16 colleagues, including Wes Streeting and Margaret Hodge - outspoken critics of Mr Corbyn over his handling of anti-Semitism allegations. Wigan MP Lisa Nandy has 11 nominations, while shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry has three. Shadow Treasury minister Clive Lewis has secured his first nomination from Rachael Maskell. Earlier, Mr Lewis rated Mr Corbyn ""six out of 10"" as leader of the Labour Party. Speaking to the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme, he criticised the outgoing leader for making mistakes on Brexit and dealing with anti-Semitism. ""But some things he got right,"" Mr Lewis added, ""so in many ways he's renewed our party.""The comments follow those of Mrs Long Bailey, who rated Mr Corbyn 10 out of 10 for his performance as leader, despite Labour's electoral defeat.

"This video can not be played The PM said the government would work to prevent an escalation of violence Boris Johnson has said General Qasem Soleimani, killed by a US drone strike last week, had ""the blood of British troops on his hands"". He told the Commons the Iranian general was also responsible for a string of attacks on innocent civilians but called for ""urgent de-escalation"". He warned Iran not to repeat ""reckless"" attacks after ballistic missiles were fired at Iraqi air bases earlier. Iran's Revolutionary Guard said they were in response to Soleimani's death. It came as President Trump on Wednesdayurged countries including the UK- to send a ""clear and united message"" to Iran that its ""campaign of terror"" will no longer be tolerated. Mr Trump also called on the UK and its other European allies to abandon the nuclear deal it signed with Iran nuclear deal with in 2015. But, at Prime Minister's Questions earlier, Mr Johnson defended the deal, saying it remains the ""best way of preventing nuclear proliferation in Iran"". How much influence does UK have in Iran crisis? Iran nuclear deal crisis in 300 words Is the Iran nuclear deal dead and buried? In his first PMQs since Parliament returned from its Christmas break, Mr Johnson said there were no UK casualties in the attacks on Iraqi air bases ""as far as we can tell"". ""We, of course, condemn the attack on Iraqi military bases hosting coalition forces,"" Mr Johnson said. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn questioned the legality of the drone strike ordered by US President Donald Trump thatkilled Soleimani outside Baghdad airport on Friday. The PM said it was not up the UK to determine whether the strike was legal ""since it was not our operation"", but added: ""I think most reasonable people would accept that the United States has the right to protect its bases and its personnel."" How much influence does UK have in Iran crisis? Iran targets US troops with missile strikes His comments come after Foreign Secretary Dominic Raabrejected the idea that the killing was an act of war. Mr Johnson and President Trump have discussed the air strike on Iraqi bases over the phone. A Downing Street spokesman said the prime minister stressed the need for ""urgent de-escalation to avoid further conflict"". This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn asks Boris Johnson if the killing of General Qasem Soleimani was illegal Mr Johnson told MPs that Soleimani had supplied ""improvised explosive devices to terrorists"" which ""killed and maimed British troops"", adding: ""That man had the blood of British troops on his hands."" Mr Corbyn's spokesman later said it was ""hard to see"" how Soleimani's assassination could be justified as a legal action. ""Since the assassination of senior officials, generals, or ministers of internationally recognised governments is, on the face of it, entirely illegal in international law, that defence - the defence of an imminent threat - has to be made public for there to be any question of there being legality around it,"" the spokesman told a Westminster briefing. He added: ""No such evidence has been forthcoming and, on the face of it, it's hard to see how that would be the case."" It has taken a while to hear from Boris Johnson directly and I suspect that will surprise a lot of people. It's been five days since this crisis erupted and this is the first we've heard from him. He's only talking about it today, frankly, because he has to at PMQs. This is because of a new approach from No 10. They want to delegate more responsibility to other cabinet ministers and not have the PM responding to every event and crisis. But it also reflects the fact that in this post-Brexit world, Mr Johnson is having to perform a very delicate balancing act. On the one hand, he wants to stay close to the Europeans, who we want good relations and a speedy trade deal with. On the other, he doesn't want to antagonise the US, with whom we want similar things. That's why you heard him talking about working solidly with the EU to dial down the conflict but at the same time defending President Trump's right to act as he did. The bottom line is that as Brexit unfolds, Mr Johnson is going to have to get pretty good at this diplomatic high-wire act. Mr Corbyn said US-Iran tensions were in ""real risk"" of developing into ""full-scale war"" and asked the prime minister whether British personnel in the area were safe. Mr Johnson said: ""As far as we can tell there were no casualties last night sustained by the US and no British personnel were injured in the attacks. ""We are doing everything we can to protect UK interests in the region, with HMS Defender and HMS Montrose operating in an enhanced state of readiness to protect shipping in the Gulf."" Mr Johnson will later discuss the situation at a meeting with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Which bases were targeted? Analysis: Is there more to come from Iran? This video can not be played This footage, reportedly of the missile attack, was shown on Iranian state TV Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei describedthe missile attackas ""a slap in the face"" for the US. The strike showed just a ""small part"" of the capabilities of the Iranian armed forces, the chief of staff for the military said. But Iran's ambassador to the UK, Hamid Baeidinejad,said the attack was an act of self-defence,externaland the country ""does not seek escalation or war"". More than a dozen missiles were fired from Iranian territories into Iraq at about 02:00 local time on Wednesday (22:30 GMT on Tuesday). The al Asad airbase - located in the Anbar province of western Iraq - was hit by at least six missiles. Lydia Wilson of the University of Oxford's Centre for the Resolution of Intractable Conflict, called it a ""symbolic"" attack that was not designed to ""really damage"" US or Iraqi military capabilities. Noting that Iran used ballistic missiles rather than more sophisticated cruise missiles, she said: ""Iran was not going to risk a major escalation in this climate. They're very overstretched in the region... they're not going to easily take on the biggest military in the world."" There are about 400 UK troops stationed in Iraq, primarily to assist Iraqi troops in defeating the Islamic State group. A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: ""We are urgently working to establish the facts on the ground. Our first priority continues to be the security of British personnel."" Defence Secretary Ben Wallace added that further ""volatility"" would only benefit terrorist groups ""who will seek to capitalise on instability"". Iraqi security forces gathered pieces of the missiles In the UK, police were ""extremely alert"" to any impact the crisis in Iran may have in Britain, the Metropolitan Police commissioner Cressida Dick has said. On Tuesday, theRoyal Navy and military helicopters were put on standbyin the Gulf amid the rising tensions in the Middle East. The government said non-essential UK personnel had also been moved out of the Iraqi capital Baghdad. Iran had vowed ""severe revenge"" following the assassination of Soleimani. The general - who controlled Iran's proxy forces across the Middle East - was regarded as a terrorist by the US government. How much influence does UK have in Iran crisis?

And following on the heels of that news, Lisa Nandy's team has also confirmed she's received the necessary nominations as well. ""I am so proud to have been nominated by a group of MPs representing different parts of the country and different traditions in our movement,"" the Wigan MP says. According to the Labour website,external, shadow business secretary Rebecca Long Bailey has also passed the threshold of 22 MP and MEP nominations as well. Among the declared runners, that just leaves Clive Lewis and Emily Thornberry looking to secure enough support from colleagues to stand. Jess Phillips has become the second Labour leadership hopeful to secure the 22 MP and MEP nominations required to make it onto the ballot. The first contender to do so, Sir Keir Starmer, has secured the most nominations so far. Candidates must also secure nominations from at least 5% of Labour's constituency parties or three affiliated bodies - two of which must be trade unions. SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford is quick to react to the result of the vote, which he calls an ""historic moment"". He says the SNP ""cannot accept what has been done to us,"" with the UK leaving the EU despite Scotland voting to remain. Lib Dem Brexit spokesman Alistair

He says his party will continue to fight the government ""to secure the rights that the Tories are determined to erase"" as the bill goes through Parliament. House of CommonsParliament By 330 votes to 231, MPs vote to give their final approval the Brexit bill - the legislation required to implement the government's Brexit deal with the EU.

House of CommonsParliament MPs are now voting on whether to pass the bill atthird
reading,external, its final Commons stage. For the past three days MPs have been scrutinising the bill. A
number of amendments were suggested, but all of them were either defeated or
not put to a vote. So MPs are voting on the latest version of the bill as drafted

House of CommonsParliament The debate on the Brexit bill comes to an end. MPs will shortly vote on whether to approve the bill at third reading, at which point it will go to the House of Lords.

We know that Brexit wonât be done for many years to come,"" she says. Ms Anderson says there was an increase in reports of racist attacks following the 2016 EU referendum. ""There are high risks that racism and discrimination will be given permission by this bill,"" she says. ""I've seen it happen, it happened straight after the referendum and it's happened since.

This period will come to an end on 31 December. Ms Whitford says the government ""sought no common ground whatsoever"" from the nations, ""despite the fact two of them voted to Remain"" in 2016.

"PM's Brexit bill faced final-stage vote in the Commons Bill given approval by 330 votes to 231 - a majority of 99 Approved bill to move to House of Lords for further consideration Paul Seddon and Emma Harrison The Northern Ireland Assembly is set to be restored, but what caused power-sharing to collapse in the first place? And following on the heels of that news, Lisa Nandy's team has also confirmed she's received the necessary nominations as well. ""I am so proud to have been nominated by a group of MPs representing different parts of the country and different traditions in our movement,"" the Wigan MP says. According to the Labour website,external, shadow business secretary Rebecca Long Bailey has also passed the threshold of 22 MP and MEP nominations as well. Among the declared runners, that just leaves Clive Lewis and Emily Thornberry looking to secure enough support from colleagues to stand. Jess Phillips has become the second Labour leadership hopeful to secure the 22 MP and MEP nominations required to make it onto the ballot. The first contender to do so, Sir Keir Starmer, has secured the most nominations so far. Candidates must also secure nominations from at least 5% of Labour's constituency parties or three affiliated bodies - two of which must be trade unions. SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford is quick to react to the result of the vote, which he calls an ""historic moment"". He says the SNP ""cannot accept what has been done to us,"" with the UK leaving the EU despite Scotland voting to remain. Lib Dem Brexit spokesman Alistair
Carmichael has put out a statement saying the bill is ""damaging"" and describing the government as ""inhumane and insular"". He says his party will continue to fight the government ""to secure the rights that the Tories are determined to erase"" as the bill goes through Parliament. House of CommonsParliament By 330 votes to 231, MPs vote to give their final approval the Brexit bill - the legislation required to implement the government's Brexit deal with the EU. The bill will now go to the House of Lords for further scrutiny next week. It will only come back to the Commons for another vote if the Lords decide to amend it. House of CommonsParliament MPs are now voting on whether to pass the bill atthird
reading,external, its final Commons stage. For the past three days MPs have been scrutinising the bill. A
number of amendments were suggested, but all of them were either defeated or
not put to a vote. So MPs are voting on the latest version of the bill as drafted
by the government after the election, which wasunveiled last month. House of CommonsParliament MPs have voted against the SNP's proposal to reject the government's Brexit bill by 329 votes to 62. House of CommonsParliament The debate on the Brexit bill comes to an end. MPs will shortly vote on whether to approve the bill at third reading, at which point it will go to the House of Lords. First, though, they are now voting on an SNP amendment to reject the bill entirely. The company had warned it could move wing-building out of the UK in the event of no deal. House of CommonsParliament Labour MP Fleur Anderson calls Brexit a âmonumental act of self-harmâ. The newly elected MP for Putney, south-west London, says there are NHS workers who are ""struggling to cope with work"" now some EU staff have left the country. ""We know the risks. We know that Brexit wonât be done for many years to come,"" she says. Ms Anderson says there was an increase in reports of racist attacks following the 2016 EU referendum. ""There are high risks that racism and discrimination will be given permission by this bill,"" she says. ""I've seen it happen, it happened straight after the referendum and it's happened since. ""So it's very important to say here in this place that we may be leaving the EU but we're proud of our place in Europe and the world."" House of CommonsParliament Conservative MP Owen Paterson warns the Lords not to delay the government's Brexit bill. The peers will consider the bill next week if, as expected, the Commons approves the legislation today. Mr Paterson says the Lords ""should respect four massive votes by the people"". ""I do hope the other place has watched what has happened,"" he says, referring to the speed at which the bill has travelled through the Commons. ""There is a very clear, determined goal which is to honour those votes, honour the result of the general election and to ensure that we leave the European at 23:00 on the evening of 31 January."" Having won the chance to introduce a private members' bill, MPs still face a number of hurdles. The things you need to know about Brexit this week, with four weeks to go until the UK leaves the EU. House of CommonsParliament Referring to the length of the transition period, which finishes at the end of this year, SNP MP Philippa Whitford tells the Commons that 11 months is a ""ridiculously short time to negotiate even a basic
free trade deal"". After its 31 January exit, the UK will enter into an 11-month transition period in which it will largely follow EU rules but will not have any representation in the bloc's institutions. This period will come to an end on 31 December. Ms Whitford says the government ""sought no common ground whatsoever"" from the nations, ""despite the fact two of them voted to Remain"" in 2016. She says that last night the Scottish governmentvoted 92 to 29 to withhold legislative consent to this bill. ""Ignoring this voiceâ¦ will undermine the very union the
members opposite protest to hold dear,"" she adds.  House of CommonsParliament Conservative MP Sir John Hayes tells MPs that ""any further hesitation"" over Brexit ""will frankly ring hollow in the ears
of those people"" that voted Leave. ""This bill is the first step, not on a trip to a different
place, but on a return journey - a return journey for this United Kingdom to hope, to patriotism
and to greatness."" House of CommonsParliament Labour's shadow Brexit minister Paul Blomfield tells MPs that the decision of the general election ""isnât a
mandate to bulldoze through a particular version of Brexit at any cost on all
the peoples of the UK, and the next few months need to be approached with
sensitivity and caution if we are to stay together as a United Kingdom"". He also calls yesterday's rejection ofan attempt by Labour to reinstate child refugee protection rightsin the Brexit bill a ""heartless move"". House of CommonsParliament MPs have now moved on to debating the governmentâs Brexit
withdrawal bill, which will be put to a vote at third reading stage later. If approved as expected, it will go to the House of Lords
next week for further scrutiny. All amendments tabled so far â including a Labour one on theprotection of child refugeesâ have either been defeated by the government or
not pushed to a vote. The only amendment being debated today is an SNP proposal to reject the
bill in its entirety, which stands no chance of being approved because of the governmentâs
80-seat majority. House of CommonsParliament Minister Heather Wheeler says both the prime minister and foreign secretary have expressed a ""readiness to help"" Australia over the ""devastating"" crisis.

"Pasi Vainikka at the Solar Foods plant near Helsinki Finnish scientists producing a protein ""from thin air"" say it will compete with soya on price within the decade. The protein is produced from soil bacteria fed on hydrogen split from water by electricity. The researchers say if the electricity comes from solar and wind power, the food can be grown with near-zero greenhouse gas emissions. If their dreams are realised, it could help the world tackle many of the problems associated with farming. When I visitedSolar Foods' pilot plant,externalon the outskirts of Helsinki last year the researchers were raising funds for expansion. Now they say they have attracted 5.5m euros of investment, and they predict â depending on the price of electricity â that their costs will roughly match those for soya production by the end of the decade - perhaps even by 2025. Plant-based diet can fight climate change - UN Meat, veg, nuts - a diet designed to feed 10bn I ate a few grains of the precious protein flour - called Solein - and tasted nothing, which is what the scientists have planned. They want it to be a neutral additive to all sorts of foods. It could mimic palm oil by reinforcing pies, ice cream, biscuits, pasta, noodles, sauces or bread. The inventors say it can be used as a medium for growing cultured meat or fish. It could also nourish cattle to save them eating soya raised on rainforest land. Even if things go according to plan â which, of course, they may not â it will be many years before the protein production is scaled up to meet global demand. But this is one of many projects looking towards a future of synthesised food. The firmâs CEO is Pasi Vainikka, who studied at Cranfield University in the UK and is now adjunct professor at Lappeenranta University. He told me the ideas behind the technology were originally developed for the space industry in the 1960s. He admits his demonstrator plant is running some months behind time but says it will be ready by 2022. A full investment decision will come in 2023, and if all goes according to plan, the first factory will appear in 2025. He said: âWe are doing pretty well so far. Once we scale the factory from the first one by adding reactors (to ferment protein) and take into account the amazingimprovements in other clean technologies like wind and solar power,,externalwe think we can compete with soya possibly as early as 2025.â To make Solein, water is ""split"", using electrolysis to make hydrogen. The hydrogen, carbon dioxide from the air and minerals are fed to bacteria, which then produce the protein. A key determinant, he said, would be the price of electricity. The firm anticipates that as more renewables come on-stream, the cost will fall. The progress of this extraordinary technology has been hailed by the environmental campaigner George Monbiot, who has made a TV documentary, Apocalypse Cow, broadcast on Channel 4 in the UK at 22:00 GMT on Wednesday. Monbiot is generally pessimistic about the future of the planet, but says Solar Foods has given him hope. He said: âFood production is ripping the living world apart. Fishing and farming are, by a long way,the greatest cause,externalof extinction and loss of the diversity and abundance of wildlife. Farming is a major cause of climate breakdown. âBut just as hope appeared to be evaporating, âfarmfree foodâ creates astonishing possibilities to save both people and planet. âBy temporarily shifting towards a plant-based diet, we can help buy the time to save species and places. âBut farmfree food offers hope where hope was missing. We will soon be able to feed the world without devouring it.â Research by the think tank RethinkX, which forecasts the implications of technology-driven disruption of many kinds, suggests that proteins from precision fermentation will bearound 10 times cheaper,externalthan animal protein by 2035. It forecasts the result will be the near-complete collapse of the livestock industry - although critics will complain that this doesnât take into account the ability of meat producers to harness the novel proteins to feed their own stock . A consortium of leading scientific research and academic institutions has been formed to identify innovative solutions to tackle climate change linked to the agri-food sector. A paper last year,externalconcluded that microbial protein was several times more efficient than soya in terms of land use, and required just a tenth as much water. Another factor, though, will be cultural. Many people will still want to eat lamb chops that look like lamb chops. Professor Leon Terry from Cranfield University told BBC News there was growing interest from investors in novel foods. âThere is increased momentum and investment round synthetic foods,â he said.

"This video can not be played EU chief Ursula von der Leyen says the UK and the EU will remain ""best of friends and partners"" The UK and the EU will remain the ""best of friends"" but they will ""not be as close as before"" after Brexit, the new European Commission president has said. Speaking ahead of talks with the PM, Ursula von der Leyen warned it would be ""impossible"" to reach a comprehensive trade deal by the end of 2020. She said if the deadline was not extended it was not a case of ""all or nothing"", but of priorities. Boris Johnson has insisted a deal is possible by December 2020. After their meeting in No 10, a Downing Street spokesman said talks had been ""positive"", but the PM had been ""clear"" the process of negotiation would not be extended. After its 31 January exit, the UK will enter into an 11-month transition period in which it will largely follow EU rules but will not have any representation in the bloc's institutions. This period will come to an end on 31 December. Only when the UK leaves the EU can the two sides begin talks on their future economic relationship. Mr Johnson told Mrs von der Leyen he ""wanted a positive new UK and EU partnership, based on friendly co-operation, our shared history, interests and values"", as well as a ""broad free trade agreement covering goods and services, and cooperation in other areas"". He also said the UK was ready to start negotiations ""as soon as possible"" after 31 January. MPs resume scrutiny of PM's Brexit bill What's happening with Brexit this week? Who is Ursula von der Leyen? MSPs set to reject UK Brexit legislation Speaking at the London School of Economics earlier in the day, Mrs von der Leyen said the EU was ""ready to negotiate a truly ambitions partnership with UK"" but she warned of ""tough"" talks ahead. ""We will go as far as we can, but the truth is that our partnership cannot and will not be the same as before and it cannot and will not be as close as before because with every choice comes a consequences with every decision comes a trade off."" Ursula von der Leyen met Boris Johnson in Number 10 Mrs von der Leyen, a former German defence minister, took over from Jean-Claude Juncker at the start of December. She was a student at the LSE in the 1970s. She also attended the same school as Mr Johnson in Belgium - something the prime minister highlighted as they posed for photos in Number 10. Mrs von der Leyen said she hoped the new trading relationship would be based on ""zero tariffs, zero quotas, zero dumping"". What is the transition period? Week ahead in Parliament But she said: ""Without the free movement of people you cannot have the free movement of capital and services. ""The more divergence there is the more distant the partnership will be."" Mrs von der Leyen also warned that without an extension of the transition period beyond 2020  ""you cannot expect to agree every single aspect of our new partnership"". She called the deadline ""very tight"". This video can not be played Barclay: 'Let's be positive' about 2020 Brexit trade deal deadline Opposition MPs have warned that trade deals typically take years to conclude and the UK risks defaulting to World Trade Organisation rules at the start of 2021, potentially leading to damaging tariffs for some industries. But Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay told BBC Breakfast the UK and EU had agreed in the political declaration to do a trade deal by the end of this year and he was ""confident"" they would do that. The meeting between Boris Johnson and new European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is significant in that it's their first face-to-face in their new roles - but today does not mark the start of post-Brexit trade talks. EU law dictates that trade talks can't start until the UK legally leaves the bloc. Then EU countries must agree a mandate for the EU Commission to negotiate a comprehensive trade agreement on their behalf. This mandate then has to be formally signed off at minister level by representatives of all EU countries. All this means, the EU says, is trade talks will start at the beginning of March. When UK ministers complain that's too long to wait, the EU response is that the UK always pushed for bigger role for national governments in EU decision-making to make it more democratic. Expect red-line drawing with smiles today between the prime minister and Mrs von der Leyen - presented as ""friends telling each other truths"". The EU position is that the prime minister's timetable to get an ""ambitious, comprehensive"" trade deal agreed and ratified by December is unrealistic. However, the prime minister will counter this with ""truths"" of his own, including that negotiations have to be done by December because he won't extend the transition period. Legislation implementing the terms of Mr Johnson's Brexit deal continues to move through the Commons, with the government easily winning all three votes on the Withdrawal Agreement Bill on Tuesday. The bill will enshrine in law the terms of the transition period, first negotiated by Mr Johnson's predecessor Theresa May, as well as agreements on citizens' rights, customs arrangements in Northern Ireland and the UK's financial settlement. Attempts by Northern Ireland parties to amend the bill to ensure ""unfettered access"" for businesses there to the rest of the UK market failed to pass on Wednesday afternoon. MPs also rejected an attempt by Labourto reinstate child refugee protection rights in the Brexit bill.

"The boss of Sainsbury's has said sales were lower during the Christmas period because fewer people bought toys. Mike Coupe told the BBC that toy sales had fallen by 20% across the market in the last two years. ""The challenge was in a couple of categories, particularly gaming and toys,"" he said, adding that there were no major releases to boost sales in the run-up to Christmas. The supermarket's like-for-like sales fell 0.7% in the 15 weeks to 4 January. While grocery sales actually increased by 0.4%, poor sales in the division that includes Argos, which is owned by Sainsbury's, weighed on the company's overall performance. Nevertheless, Mr Coupe said the company had delivered a ""real sense of momentum"". Christmas pudding sales burnt out in festive period Next lifts profit forecast after Christmas sales boost - BBC News Clothing sales grew by 5%, which Mr Coupe said was helped by colder weather in the weeks before Christmas. ""Womenswear was particularly popular, including a sell-out range of novelty Christmas jumpers,"" Sainsbury's said. ""These results show a mixed picture for the retailer,"" said Richard Lim, who runs analyst firm Retail Economics. ""On the one hand, the food business held up relatively well in an extremely tough market,"" he said. ""On the other, Argos appears to have had a much tougher time delivering an uncomfortable decline in sales over the festive period."" Data released by two research firms, Nielsen and Kantar, on Tuesday suggested that Sainsbury's was the least worst performer among the so-called ""big four"" supermarkets over the all-important Christmas period. Morrisons reported a 1.7% drop in like-for-like sales, excluding fuel, for the 22 weeks to 5 January. The company said: ""Throughout the period, trading conditions remained challenging and the customer uncertainty of the last year was sustained.""

"Pasi Vainikka at the Solar Foods plant near Helsinki Finnish scientists producing a protein ""from thin air"" say it will compete with soya on price within the decade. The protein is produced from soil bacteria fed on hydrogen split from water by electricity. The researchers say if the electricity comes from solar and wind power, the food can be grown with near-zero greenhouse gas emissions. If their dreams are realised, it could help the world tackle many of the problems associated with farming. When I visitedSolar Foods' pilot plant,externalon the outskirts of Helsinki last year the researchers were raising funds for expansion. Now they say they have attracted 5.5m euros of investment, and they predict â depending on the price of electricity â that their costs will roughly match those for soya production by the end of the decade - perhaps even by 2025. Plant-based diet can fight climate change - UN Meat, veg, nuts - a diet designed to feed 10bn I ate a few grains of the precious protein flour - called Solein - and tasted nothing, which is what the scientists have planned. They want it to be a neutral additive to all sorts of foods. It could mimic palm oil by reinforcing pies, ice cream, biscuits, pasta, noodles, sauces or bread. The inventors say it can be used as a medium for growing cultured meat or fish. It could also nourish cattle to save them eating soya raised on rainforest land. Even if things go according to plan â which, of course, they may not â it will be many years before the protein production is scaled up to meet global demand. But this is one of many projects looking towards a future of synthesised food. The firmâs CEO is Pasi Vainikka, who studied at Cranfield University in the UK and is now adjunct professor at Lappeenranta University. He told me the ideas behind the technology were originally developed for the space industry in the 1960s. He admits his demonstrator plant is running some months behind time but says it will be ready by 2022. A full investment decision will come in 2023, and if all goes according to plan, the first factory will appear in 2025. He said: âWe are doing pretty well so far. Once we scale the factory from the first one by adding reactors (to ferment protein) and take into account the amazingimprovements in other clean technologies like wind and solar power,,externalwe think we can compete with soya possibly as early as 2025.â To make Solein, water is ""split"", using electrolysis to make hydrogen. The hydrogen, carbon dioxide from the air and minerals are fed to bacteria, which then produce the protein. A key determinant, he said, would be the price of electricity. The firm anticipates that as more renewables come on-stream, the cost will fall.

"Future medical advances are at risk because NHS pressures are hampering the ability of staff to take part in vital research, leading academics say.

"The boss of Sainsbury's has said sales were lower during the Christmas period because fewer people bought toys. Mike Coupe told the BBC that toy sales had fallen by 20% across the market in the last two years. ""The challenge was in a couple of categories, particularly gaming and toys,"" he said, adding that there were no major releases to boost sales in the run-up to Christmas. The supermarket's like-for-like sales fell 0.7% in the 15 weeks to 4 January. While grocery sales actually increased by 0.4%, poor sales in the division that includes Argos, which is owned by Sainsbury's, weighed on the company's overall performance. Nevertheless, Mr Coupe said the company had delivered a ""real sense of momentum"". Christmas pudding sales burnt out in festive period Next lifts profit forecast after Christmas sales boost - BBC News Clothing sales grew by 5%, which Mr Coupe said was helped by colder weather in the weeks before Christmas. ""Womenswear was particularly popular, including a sell-out range of novelty Christmas jumpers,"" Sainsbury's said. ""These results show a mixed picture for the retailer,"" said Richard Lim, who runs analyst firm Retail Economics. ""On the one hand, the food business held up relatively well in an extremely tough market,"" he said. ""On the other, Argos appears to have had a much tougher time delivering an uncomfortable decline in sales over the festive period."" Data released by two research firms, Nielsen and Kantar, on Tuesday suggested that Sainsbury's was the least worst performer among the so-called ""big four"" supermarkets over the all-important Christmas period. Morrisons reported a 1.7% drop in like-for-like sales, excluding fuel, for the 22 weeks to 5 January. The company said: ""Throughout the period, trading conditions remained challenging and the customer uncertainty of the last year was sustained.""

"Iran's missile capabilities are a key part of its military prowess Iran has launched more than a dozen missiles at two bases in Iraq housing US forces. It had vowed to retaliate after its most powerful military commander, General Qasem Soleimani, was killed by a US drone strike at Baghdad airport. So what do we know about Iran's military capabilities? Iran's missile systems are a key part of its military arsenal given its relative lack of air power. Regional rivals such as Israel and Saudi Arabia have the technology to carry out precision air strikes. Iran largely lacks this capability and so relies on launching missiles. A US Defense Department report describes the country's missile forces as the largest in the Middle East. It's not possible to give precise figures but the US-based Centre for Strategic and International Studies says Iran has thousands of missiles of more than a dozen different types. An Iranian media outlet reported that Fateh and Qiam missiles were used in the attack on the US base. Military analysts have also pointed to the use of these types based on images of the attack sites. The Qiam-1 missile has been widely produced since 2011, has a range of up 700km and a payload (an indication of how much explosive material it can carry) of 750kg.  It was used by Iran against IS fighters in June 2017. The Fateh class of missiles, which first went into service in the early 2000s, have a slightly lower payload. The variations of theShahab-3,externalintermediate range ballistic missile have payloads of more than 750kg and ranges upwards of 1,500km. For comparison, a US-built F35 fighter jet has a payload of up to 10,000kg. Iran has up to 50 medium range ballistic missile launchers and up to 100 short range ballistic missile launchers, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a UK-based think tank. Iran is also testing space technology to allow it to develop longer range inter-continental missiles, according to the US report. ""Iran has a highly developed missile force with weapons of a variety of ranges"" says Jonathan Marcus, the BBC's Defence and diplomatic correspondent. ""They are reasonably accurate - but not as accurate or as reliable as advanced western systems."" What is the Patriot missile defence system? The long-range missile programme was put on hold by Iran following the 2015 nuclear deal, according to the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), but this may now have resumedgiven the uncertainty surrounding that deal. In any case, many targets in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf would be within range of Iran's current short and medium-range missiles, and possibly targets in Israel as well. In May last year, the US deployed a Patriot anti-missile defence system to the Middle East as tensions with Iran increased. This is meant to counter ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and advanced aircraft. There are an estimated 523,000 active Iranian personnel, according to the IISS. This includes 350,000 in the regular army, and at least 150,000 in the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC). There are a further 20,000 service personnel in the IRGC's naval forces. This group operates a number of armed patrol boats in the Strait of Hormuz, the site of several confrontations involving foreign-flagged tankers in 2019. Seized British-flagged tanker leaves Iran The IRGC also controls the Basij unit, a volunteer force which has helped suppress internal dissent. This unit can potentially mobilise many hundreds of thousands of personnel. The IRGC has its own navy and air force, and oversees Iran's strategic weapons The IRGC was set up 40 years ago to defend the Islamic system in Iran and has become a major military, political and economic force in its own right. Profile: Iran's Revolutionary Guards Top Iranian general killed by US in Iraq Despite having fewer troops than the regular army, it is considered the most authoritative military force in Iran. The Quds Force, which was led by General Soleimani, conducts secret operations abroad for the IRGC and reports directly to the Supreme Leader of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. It's believed to be about 5,000 strong. The unit has been deployed to Syria, where it advised military elements loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and armed Shia militias fighting with them. In Iraq, it has supported a Shia-dominated paramilitary force which assisted in the defeat of IS. However, the US says the Quds force has a wider role by providing funding, training, weapons and equipment to organisations that Washington has designated as terrorist groups in the Middle East. These include Lebanon's Hezbollah movement and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Iran's IRGC detained the British-flagged tanker the Stena Impero in the Strait of Hormuz in 2019 Economic problems and sanctions have hampered Iran's arms imports, which are relatively small compared to those of other countries in the region. The value of Iran's defence imports between 2009 and 2018 was equivalent to just 3.5% of Saudi Arabia's imports over the same period, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. Most Iranian imports come from Russia, and the rest from China. Iran does not currently have a nuclear weapons programme, and has previously said it does not want one. But it does have many of the elements required and the knowledge to create a military nuclear capability. In 2015, the US government under President Obama estimated that Iran only needed two to three months to produce enough nuclear material to make a weapon. Iran nuclear deal: Key details Why do uranium enrichment limits matter? Is the Iran nuclear deal dead? The nuclear agreement that year between Tehran and six world powers - from which President Trump withdrew in 2018 -  introduced limits and international checks on Iran's nuclear activities. It aimed to make it more difficult and time consuming to develop weapons-grade material. Following the killing of General Soleimani by US forces, Iran has said it will not be bound by these restrictions. But it also says it will continue to co-operate with the UN's nuclear watchdog, the IAEA. The US has accused Iran of supplying Houthi rebels with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Despite years of sanctions, Iran has also been able to develop drone capabilities. In Iraq, Iranian drones have been used since 2016 in the fight against IS. Iran has also entered Israeli airspace with armed drones operated from bases in Syria, according to Rusi. In June 2019, Iran shot down a US surveillance drone, claiming it had violated Iranian airspace over the Strait of Hormuz. The other aspect of Iran's drone programme is its willingness to sell or transfer its drone technology to its allies and proxies in the region, says Jonathan Marcus,the BBC's Defence and diplomatic correspondent. In 2019, drone and missile attacks damaged two key Saudi oil facilities. Both the US and Saudi Arabia linked these attacks to Iran, although Tehran denied any involvement and pointed to a claim of responsibility by rebels in Yemen. Following a major cyber-attack in 2010 on Iranian nuclear facilities, Iran ramped up its own cyber-space capability. The Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) is believed to have its own cyber-command, working on commercial and military espionage. In 2012, US officials blamed Iran for a series of cyber attacks on US banks intended to disrupt traffic to their websites. A US military report in 2019 said Iran had also targeted aerospace companies, defence contractors, energy and natural resource companies and telecommunications firms for cyber-espionage operations around the world. Also in 2019, Microsoft said a hacker group that ""originates from Iran and is linked to the Iranian government""targeted a US presidential campaign and tried to break into the accounts of American government officials.,external Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions Follow us on Twitter,external LA mayor says winds and drought created 'perfect storm', while officials hit out at looters Climate 'whiplash' linked to raging LA fires Watch: The moment five US presidents gather at Jimmy Carter's funeral The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

"President Trump said Soleimani was plotting imminent attacks on American diplomats US President Donald Trump ordered the drone strike that killed Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani in Iraq but what are the legal grounds for this course of action? The US said: ""This strike was aimed at deterring future Iranian attack plans."" So, what are the key issues when considering its legality, according to international law? The relevant law in the UN Charter allows for a state to act in self-defence ""if an armed attack occurs"". But this definition tends to be interpreted by governments, say legal experts. ""In the Soleimani case, the US is claiming it acted in self-defence to prevent imminent attacks, a category of action which, if in fact true, is generally seen as being permissible under the UN Charter,"" says Dapo Akande, professor of public international law at Oxford University and co-director of the Oxford Institute for Ethics, Law and Armed Conflict (ELAC). But Agnes Callamard, UN special rapporteur on extra-judicial killings. has tweeted about the strike saying ""this test is unlikely to be met"". Allow Twitter content?

A2010 UN report on ""targeted killings"",externalsaid there was a weighty body of scholarship that viewed the self-defence argument as having the right to use force ""against a real and imminent threat when the necessity of that self-defence is instant, overwhelming, and leaving no choice of means, and no moment of deliberation."" Who was Iran's Qasem Soleimani? Will his killing spark war and more of your questions Iran's response options for Soleimani's death Does Trump have a strategy? Theinitial US Department of Defense statement,externalomitted the word ""imminent"" and said the strike was aimed at deterring future Iranian attacks and that Iran's top military leader Soleimani was ""actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region"". In later statements, US officials including President Trump said Soleimani had been plotting ""imminent attacks"". Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic Party candidate for the US presidency, said: ""The administration cannot keep its story straight."" The legality of the strike under international law may well depend on the US providing evidence of those future attacks, according to Mr Akande. The US government has not yet shared details publicly, but the administration has said intelligence has been shared with key figures in the US Congress. Asked by a journalist on 7 January for more details about imminent threats, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo notedthe incidents leading up to the strike, but did not provide any evidence of impending attacks. There are other justifications it has used in the past, according to Dr Ralph Wilde, an expert in public international law at University College London. ""Since 9/11 the US has taken a view that self-defence can be justified to prevent more longer-term attacks. When the attack is being planned, but is not imminent. The Obama administration used this argument to justify drone strikes."" Obama defends 'just' drones war This video can not be played Mourners packed the streets in Tehran - and Iran's supreme leader wept as he led prayers The other issue is whether the US had consent from Iraq to carry out the strike there. Iraqi MPs reacted angrily and passed a non-binding resolution calling for US troops to leave the country. The Iraqi government has called it a ""brazen violation of Iraq's sovereignty"". US forces had been invited into Iraq to fight the Islamic State group and to train Iraqi forces. The US might argue this invitation constituted some form of consent, giving them a right to protect their interests and personnel inside Iraq. But Mr Akande argues that, in practice, the terms of the agreement to host US forces would not stretch to carrying out an attack like this. Persepolis is one of Iran's most famous cultural sites On Sunday, Mr Trump tweeted, warning the US would target sites that were ""important to Iran and the Iranian culture"" if American assets were hit. The Iran Foreign Minister, Javad Zarif said an attack on a cultural site would amount to a war crime.

But an attack on a cultural site would violate several international treaties. The 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property safeguarded cultural sites in the wake of the destruction of cultural heritage sites during World War Two, and was signed by the US. In 2017, the UN passed a resolution in response to the Islamic State attacks which condemned ""the unlawful destruction of cultural heritage, including the destruction of religious sites and artefacts"". The US was among the harshest critics of the IS destruction of historic site of Palmyra in Syria in 2015, as well as the Taliban's demolition of the Bamiyan Buddhas in Afghanistan in 2001. In 2016, the International Criminal Court (ICC) convicted someone for the destruction of cultural heritage for the first time, after an extremist linked to Al-Qaeda destroyed religious artefacts in Mali. The US is not part of the ICC but it is a signatory of other agreements to protect cultural property and any attack would represent a significant reversal.

"Natalie Whiting from Stevenage hasn't received her euros Customers of Travelex say they feel let down after being left with no travel money from the company which is in the midst of a cyber-attack. One customer, Natalie Whiting from Stevenage, ordered Â£1,000 worth of euros online through Tesco. ""I haven't been able to get a refund of my money, it just seems to be in limbo,"" she told the BBC. On Tuesday, the foreign currency trader confirmed that it is the victim of a ransomware attack. The criminals behind the hack told the BBC they are demanding $6m (Â£4.6m) or company computer systems will be deleted and customer data sold online. Travelex says that there is no evidence customer data has been compromised. In response to the cyber-attack, which was first discovered on New Year's Eve, Travelex took all computer systems offline, affecting thousands of sites in dozens of countries. Cashiers have been resorting to using pen and paper to keep money moving at cash desks in airports and on high streets but orders online have been affected. Business partners which rely on Travelex for currency services, like Sainsbury's, Tesco and Virgin Money have also been affected. ""I ordered over Â£1,000 of euros from Tesco bank online for collection in my local Tesco store on 31 December, ready to be collected on 3 January,"" Ms Whiting told the BBC ""The money was taken from my account and an order confirmation was sent to me, but I went to Tesco to collect my euros last Friday to be told of the Travelex issue. ""I am now Â£1,000 out of pocket after saving up for so long and there's no information or help."" Travelex confirmed to the BBC that no direct communication had been sent to customers about the attack, partly because all the computer systems are offline. Visitors to the Travelex UK website are told that the site is down for ""planned maintenance"" and partner sites, including Sainsbury's travel money, have similar messages. Stephen Wright had to buy currency elsewhere Stephen Wright, from Banff in north-east Scotland, is also furious with the way the company is handling the incident. He said: ""I ordered euros on 23 December from Tesco bank. Delivery was due on 3 January but obviously, due to the problem with Travelex, nothing has yet arrived. ""There has been no communication from Tesco bank, so I called them. They simply say there is nothing they can do, that I must just wait until the problem is rectified, whenever that will be. ""I have been forced to purchase more euros elsewhere, leaving me considerably out of pocket."" A ransomware gang called Sodinokibi carried out the attack. The gang, also known as REvil, claims it first gained access to the company's computer network six months ago and has since downloaded 5 gigabytes of sensitive customer data. Dates of birth, credit card information and national insurance numbers are all in their possession, they claim. However, a Travelex spokeswoman said on Tuesday night in a statement: ""Whilst the investigation is still ongoing, Travelex has confirmed that the software virus is ransomware known as Sodinokibi, also commonly referred to as REvil."" ""Travelex has proactively taken steps to contain the spread of the ransomware, which has been successful. To date, the company can confirm that whilst there has been some data encryption, there is no evidence that structured personal customer data has been encrypted. ""Whist Travelex does not yet have a complete picture of all the data that has been encrypted, there is still no evidence to date that any data has been exfiltrated."" The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) said it had not received a data breach report from Travelex. A spokeswoman added: ""Organisations must notify the ICO within 72 hours of becoming aware of a personal data breach unless it does not pose a risk to people's rights and freedoms. ""If an organisation decides that a breach doesn't need to be reported, they should keep their own record of it and be able to explain why it wasn't reported if necessary."" Under General Data Protection Regulation, a company which fails to comply can face a maximum fine of 4% of its global turnover. The Metropolitan Police says its Cyber Crime team is leading the investigation into the attack. Travelex has not said whether or not they are negotiating with the hackers and have not given any timeframe for when normal service will resume.

"Oil prices have receded, after rising following an Iranian attack on two bases hosting US troops in Iraq. Financial markets were also relatively calm despite the conflict, amid investor hopes that the two sides would avoid further escalation. US President Donald Trump said he would seek additional economic sanctions, but he stopped short of calling for military action. The three main share indexes in the US closed the day up about 0.5% or more. While oil prices had jumped to an almost four-month high overnight, they fell back during trade on Wednesday. Brent Crude was down more than 3% to about $65.78 per barrel by mid-day in New York and West Texas International fell more than 4%. Despite that pullback, oil prices remain nearly 25% higher over the last 12 months, due in part to rising tensions in the Middle East. Iranian state television saidthe attack was a retaliation for the killing of the country's top commander Qasem Soleimani. US airbases in Iraq hit by ballistic missiles The US, Iran and Soleimani story explained What is Trump's strategy on Iran? The attack happened just hours after the funeral service for Soleimani, who was killed by a US drone strike on Friday. His death had raised concerns that the conflict between the US and Iran could escalate further. That could disrupt shipping in the world's busiest sea route for oil,the Strait of Hormuz. Around a fifth of global oil supply passes through the strait which connects the Gulf with the Arabian Sea. The Strait of Hormuz is vital for the main oil exporters in the Gulf region - Saudi Arabia, Iraq, the UAE, and Kuwait - whose economies are built around oil and gas production. Iran also relies heavily on this route for its oil exports. Qatar, the world's biggest producer of liquefied natural gas (LNG), exports nearly all its gas through the strait. After the latest attacks, the US aviation regulator banned American airlines from flying over Iraq, Iran and neighbouring countries. The ban includes the Gulf of Oman and the waters between Iran and Saudi Arabia. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said the decision was in response to heightened military activity, and increased political tension in the region. Before the latest guidance, the FAA had already prohibited US airlines from flying below 26,000 feet (7,925 metres) over Iraq and from flying over an area of Iranian airspace above the Gulf of Oman since Iran shot down an American drone in June 2019. At the same time Singapore Airlines has said that all of its flights would now be diverted from Iranian airspace.

"Iran's missile capabilities are a key part of its military prowess Iran has launched more than a dozen missiles at two bases in Iraq housing US forces. It had vowed to retaliate after its most powerful military commander, General Qasem Soleimani, was killed by a US drone strike at Baghdad airport. So what do we know about Iran's military capabilities? Iran's missile systems are a key part of its military arsenal given its relative lack of air power. Regional rivals such as Israel and Saudi Arabia have the technology to carry out precision air strikes. Iran largely lacks this capability and so relies on launching missiles. A US Defense Department report describes the country's missile forces as the largest in the Middle East. It's not possible to give precise figures but the US-based Centre for Strategic and International Studies says Iran has thousands of missiles of more than a dozen different types. An Iranian media outlet reported that Fateh and Qiam missiles were used in the attack on the US base. Military analysts have also pointed to the use of these types based on images of the attack sites. The Qiam-1 missile has been widely produced since 2011, has a range of up 700km and a payload (an indication of how much explosive material it can carry) of 750kg.  It was used by Iran against IS fighters in June 2017. The Fateh class of missiles, which first went into service in the early 2000s, have a slightly lower payload. The variations of theShahab-3,externalintermediate range ballistic missile have payloads of more than 750kg and ranges upwards of 1,500km. For comparison, a US-built F35 fighter jet has a payload of up to 10,000kg. Iran has up to 50 medium range ballistic missile launchers and up to 100 short range ballistic missile launchers, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a UK-based think tank. Iran is also testing space technology to allow it to develop longer range inter-continental missiles, according to the US report. ""Iran has a highly developed missile force with weapons of a variety of ranges"" says Jonathan Marcus, the BBC's Defence and diplomatic correspondent. ""They are reasonably accurate - but not as accurate or as reliable as advanced western systems."" What is the Patriot missile defence system? The long-range missile programme was put on hold by Iran following the 2015 nuclear deal, according to the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), but this may now have resumedgiven the uncertainty surrounding that deal. In any case, many targets in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf would be within range of Iran's current short and medium-range missiles, and possibly targets in Israel as well. In May last year, the US deployed a Patriot anti-missile defence system to the Middle East as tensions with Iran increased. This is meant to counter ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and advanced aircraft. There are an estimated 523,000 active Iranian personnel, according to the IISS. This includes 350,000 in the regular army, and at least 150,000 in the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC). There are a further 20,000 service personnel in the IRGC's naval forces. This group operates a number of armed patrol boats in the Strait of Hormuz, the site of several confrontations involving foreign-flagged tankers in 2019. Seized British-flagged tanker leaves Iran The IRGC also controls the Basij unit, a volunteer force which has helped suppress internal dissent. This unit can potentially mobilise many hundreds of thousands of personnel. The IRGC has its own navy and air force, and oversees Iran's strategic weapons The IRGC was set up 40 years ago to defend the Islamic system in Iran and has become a major military, political and economic force in its own right. Profile: Iran's Revolutionary Guards Top Iranian general killed by US in Iraq Despite having fewer troops than the regular army, it is considered the most authoritative military force in Iran. The Quds Force, which was led by General Soleimani, conducts secret operations abroad for the IRGC and reports directly to the Supreme Leader of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. It's believed to be about 5,000 strong. The unit has been deployed to Syria, where it advised military elements loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and armed Shia militias fighting with them. In Iraq, it has supported a Shia-dominated paramilitary force which assisted in the defeat of IS. However, the US says the Quds force has a wider role by providing funding, training, weapons and equipment to organisations that Washington has designated as terrorist groups in the Middle East. These include Lebanon's Hezbollah movement and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Iran's IRGC detained the British-flagged tanker the Stena Impero in the Strait of Hormuz in 2019 Economic problems and sanctions have hampered Iran's arms imports, which are relatively small compared to those of other countries in the region. The value of Iran's defence imports between 2009 and 2018 was equivalent to just 3.5% of Saudi Arabia's imports over the same period, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. Most Iranian imports come from Russia, and the rest from China. Iran does not currently have a nuclear weapons programme, and has previously said it does not want one. But it does have many of the elements required and the knowledge to create a military nuclear capability. In 2015, the US government under President Obama estimated that Iran only needed two to three months to produce enough nuclear material to make a weapon. Iran nuclear deal: Key details Why do uranium enrichment limits matter? Is the Iran nuclear deal dead? The nuclear agreement that year between Tehran and six world powers - from which President Trump withdrew in 2018 -  introduced limits and international checks on Iran's nuclear activities. It aimed to make it more difficult and time consuming to develop weapons-grade material. Following the killing of General Soleimani by US forces, Iran has said it will not be bound by these restrictions. But it also says it will continue to co-operate with the UN's nuclear watchdog, the IAEA. The US has accused Iran of supplying Houthi rebels with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Despite years of sanctions, Iran has also been able to develop drone capabilities. In Iraq, Iranian drones have been used since 2016 in the fight against IS. Iran has also entered Israeli airspace with armed drones operated from bases in Syria, according to Rusi. In June 2019, Iran shot down a US surveillance drone, claiming it had violated Iranian airspace over the Strait of Hormuz. The other aspect of Iran's drone programme is its willingness to sell or transfer its drone technology to its allies and proxies in the region, says Jonathan Marcus,the BBC's Defence and diplomatic correspondent. In 2019, drone and missile attacks damaged two key Saudi oil facilities. Both the US and Saudi Arabia linked these attacks to Iran, although Tehran denied any involvement and pointed to a claim of responsibility by rebels in Yemen. Following a major cyber-attack in 2010 on Iranian nuclear facilities, Iran ramped up its own cyber-space capability. The Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) is believed to have its own cyber-command, working on commercial and military espionage. In 2012, US officials blamed Iran for a series of cyber attacks on US banks intended to disrupt traffic to their websites. A US military report in 2019 said Iran had also targeted aerospace companies, defence contractors, energy and natural resource companies and telecommunications firms for cyber-espionage operations around the world. Also in 2019, Microsoft said a hacker group that ""originates from Iran and is linked to the Iranian government""targeted a US presidential campaign and tried to break into the accounts of American government officials.,external Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions Follow us on Twitter,external LA mayor says winds and drought created 'perfect storm', while officials hit out at looters Climate 'whiplash' linked to raging LA fires Watch: The moment five US presidents gather at Jimmy Carter's funeral The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

"Social media influencer Molly Mae Hague has become the latest in a string of reality stars to have a complaint upheld against her by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA). A complaint claimed that a post on her Instagram about an outfit from online retailer Pretty Little Thing was not identifiable as an advert. PLT claimed the post had been ""organically"" shared by Ms Hague. The ASA has ruled the post should not appear in its current form again. Ms Mae was made famous by the ITV show Love Island. The offending post, which was shared on the TV personality's Instagram page on 26 September 2019, featured an image of her wearing a coat alongside the caption: ""A/W, I'm ready [brown leaf emoji]"". The official Instagram account for Pretty Little Thing was also tagged in the photograph. The reality star is a brand ambassador for the popular clothing brand and, in accordance with her contract, any advertising for the company has to be clearly identifiable to her 3.6 million followers. Instagram e-cigarette posts banned by ad watchdog Both PLT and Ms Hague argued that the post wasn't included in her contractual agreement. They claimed the post fell outside the realms of their partnership, and instead simply demonstrated her genuine interest in the brand's clothing. However, the ASA upheld the complaint and ruled that future posts made by Ms Mae must include phrases such as ""#ad"" to make her partnership with the brand clear. It comes after rival clothing company Boohoohad an advert banned last year when the ASA ruled it ""made light of a potentially harmful social trend"". The company put the phrase ""send nudes"" in a message sent to promote a range of clothes coloured to resemble skin.

The Iraqi military said Iran fired five missiles towards Irbil air base, in the northern Kurdistan region. It did not say how many hit the base, but state TV reported that two missiles landed in the village of Sidan, 16km (10 miles) north-west of the city of Irbil, and that a third missile came down in the Bardah Rashsh area, about 47km north-west of Irbil. Journalists meanwhile photographed residents standing beside what they believed was the crater caused by the missile that hit Bardah Rashsh. Iranâs Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) said it
launched attacks on Iraqi bases housing US forces in retaliation for the US

missilesâ were launched early on Wednesday âto crush the occupied air base of

military operations in western Iraq. Iranâs Tasnim news agency, which is close to the IRGC,
reported that Fateh-313 and Qiam missiles were used in the attack ,
and that US forces failed to intercept them because they were equipped with
cluster warheads. The warheads also caused âtens of explosionsâ at Al Asad, it said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

President Trump has received praise for his measured speech this morning, appearing to de-escalate tensions with Iran. But has it helped his popularity? According to FiveThirtyEight - a statistics-based news website - the answer is not much. Throughout the US-Iranian conflict of the past week, FiveThirtyEight has found Trump's approval sitting steady - at around 41.9%, while his disapproval rating remains at around 53.3%. A look at the headlines across major US outlets. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson spoke with President Trump today, the White House has confirmed. It said the two leaders discussed ""the current situation in the Middle East and agreed to continue close coordination in support of shared national security interests."" UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab is set to meet with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo this evening. The meeting had originally been expected to take place on Thursday.

Jonathan MarcusBBC Diplomatic and defence correspondent President
Trumpâs speech was a curious amalgam of threats, bluster â and a touch of
de-escalation. Nonetheless he still slapped-on more economic sanctions against
Tehran. He triumphed in the killing of General Suleimani, who he
described as âthe worldâs top terrorist.â But there were essentially three key
messages. First, de-escalation. There were no US casualties caused by the
Iranian missile strikes. He said that Iran was âstanding downâ, presumably
returning its deployed missile forces to their bases. He did not threaten an
immediate US response. Second, the nuclear deal. He called upon the
other parties to the nuclear agreement - the JCPOA - which the US long-ago
abandoned, to similarly give it up as a bad job. Third, stressing US energy
independence, he called upon Nato countries âto become much more involved in
the Middle East processâ. This will inevitably be seen as another signal that
the US is tiring of its role in the region and that will not be welcomed by his allies either in the Middle East or in Nato. So
this was a speech full of Trumpian contradiction and the few references to a
brighter future for the Iranian people provided little tangible hope of any new
diplomatic initiative. In the wake of the US drone attack and Iranâs missile
strikes, it appears to be back to business as usual. Senior US Democrats have told reporters that no schedule has been set yet for voting on a war powers resolution to limit President Trump's military actions regarding Iran. The officials said the legislation was still being drafted. Democratic lawmakers want to put a check on the president's powers after he failed to inform Congress ahead of the US drone strike that killed Soleimani.

Aleem MaqboolBBC North America correspondent The missile launch may have been the most direct assault by Iran on the US for decades, but the apparent lack of casualties gave Donald Trump an opportunity to de-escalate tensions â one that he appears to have taken. The US President had previously promised to respond to an attack on any American target âquickly and fullyâ and in his words âperhaps in a disproportionate mannerâ. But â in a statement at the White House, surrounded by top officials â he said the attacks in Irbil and close to Baghdad constituted Iran âstanding downâ. He even talked of the US and Iran working together to counter the Islamic State group. Of course, there may be more retaliation to come from Tehran for the killing of its top general Qasem Soleimani, but the threat of all out war appears have diminished a little. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Natalie Whiting from Stevenage hasn't received her euros Customers of Travelex say they feel let down after being left with no travel money from the company which is in the midst of a cyber-attack. One customer, Natalie Whiting from Stevenage, ordered Â£1,000 worth of euros online through Tesco. ""I haven't been able to get a refund of my money, it just seems to be in limbo,"" she told the BBC. On Tuesday, the foreign currency trader confirmed that it is the victim of a ransomware attack. The criminals behind the hack told the BBC they are demanding $6m (Â£4.6m) or company computer systems will be deleted and customer data sold online. Travelex says that there is no evidence customer data has been compromised. In response to the cyber-attack, which was first discovered on New Year's Eve, Travelex took all computer systems offline, affecting thousands of sites in dozens of countries. Cashiers have been resorting to using pen and paper to keep money moving at cash desks in airports and on high streets but orders online have been affected. Business partners which rely on Travelex for currency services, like Sainsbury's, Tesco and Virgin Money have also been affected. ""I ordered over Â£1,000 of euros from Tesco bank online for collection in my local Tesco store on 31 December, ready to be collected on 3 January,"" Ms Whiting told the BBC ""The money was taken from my account and an order confirmation was sent to me, but I went to Tesco to collect my euros last Friday to be told of the Travelex issue. ""I am now Â£1,000 out of pocket after saving up for so long and there's no information or help."" Travelex confirmed to the BBC that no direct communication had been sent to customers about the attack, partly because all the computer systems are offline. Visitors to the Travelex UK website are told that the site is down for ""planned maintenance"" and partner sites, including Sainsbury's travel money, have similar messages. Stephen Wright had to buy currency elsewhere Stephen Wright, from Banff in north-east Scotland, is also furious with the way the company is handling the incident. He said: ""I ordered euros on 23 December from Tesco bank. Delivery was due on 3 January but obviously, due to the problem with Travelex, nothing has yet arrived. ""There has been no communication from Tesco bank, so I called them. They simply say there is nothing they can do, that I must just wait until the problem is rectified, whenever that will be. ""I have been forced to purchase more euros elsewhere, leaving me considerably out of pocket."" A ransomware gang called Sodinokibi carried out the attack. The gang, also known as REvil, claims it first gained access to the company's computer network six months ago and has since downloaded 5 gigabytes of sensitive customer data. Dates of birth, credit card information and national insurance numbers are all in their possession, they claim. However, a Travelex spokeswoman said on Tuesday night in a statement: ""Whilst the investigation is still ongoing, Travelex has confirmed that the software virus is ransomware known as Sodinokibi, also commonly referred to as REvil."" ""Travelex has proactively taken steps to contain the spread of the ransomware, which has been successful. To date, the company can confirm that whilst there has been some data encryption, there is no evidence that structured personal customer data has been encrypted. ""Whist Travelex does not yet have a complete picture of all the data that has been encrypted, there is still no evidence to date that any data has been exfiltrated."" The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) said it had not received a data breach report from Travelex. A spokeswoman added: ""Organisations must notify the ICO within 72 hours of becoming aware of a personal data breach unless it does not pose a risk to people's rights and freedoms. ""If an organisation decides that a breach doesn't need to be reported, they should keep their own record of it and be able to explain why it wasn't reported if necessary."" Under General Data Protection Regulation, a company which fails to comply can face a maximum fine of 4% of its global turnover. The Metropolitan Police says its Cyber Crime team is leading the investigation into the attack. Travelex has not said whether or not they are negotiating with the hackers and have not given any timeframe for when normal service will resume.

The BBC's defence correspondent Jonathan Marcus said: âWhether this was by design, or just due to shortcomings with the manufacture and accuracy of their missiles, as yet remains unclear.â âHowever, launching long range missiles against US bases is a risky way of making a point.â He added: âLooking at the initial civilian satellite pictures of the impacts of the Iranian missiles at Al Asad air base, they appear to have destroyed several structures, so the lack of casualties could be as much by luck rather than design.â The Iraqi military, which also reported no casualties,
said the country was hit by 22 missiles between 01:45 and 02:15 local time on
Wednesday (22:45-23:15 GMT on Tuesday). Seventeen missiles were fired towards Al Asad air base, it
said. Satellite photographs taken by a commercial company, Planet, for the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, showed what
appeared to be at least five destroyed structures at Al Asad. David Schmerler, an analyst at the Middlebury Institute,told NPR,external: ""Some of the locations struck look like the missiles hit dead
centre."" Two of the missiles aimed at Al Asad fell in the Hitan area, west of the town of Hit, and did not explode, according to the Iraqi military.

The Iraqi military said Iran fired five missiles towards Irbil air base, in the northern Kurdistan region. It did not say how many hit the base, but state TV reported that two missiles landed in the village of Sidan, 16km (10 miles) north-west of the city of Irbil, and that a third missile came down in the Bardah Rashsh area, about 47km north-west of Irbil. Journalists meanwhile photographed residents standing beside what they believed was the crater caused by the missile that hit Bardah Rashsh. Iranâs Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) said it
launched attacks on Iraqi bases housing US forces in retaliation for the US
drone strike in Baghdad last Friday that killed the top Iranian general, Qasem Soleimani. An IRGC statement said âtens of surface-to-surface
missilesâ were launched early on Wednesday âto crush the occupied air base of
terrorist and aggressor army of the US in Al Asadâ, the hub for American
military operations in western Iraq. Iranâs Tasnim news agency, which is close to the IRGC,
reported that Fateh-313 and Qiam missiles were used in the attack ,
and that US forces failed to intercept them because they were equipped with
cluster warheads. The warheads also caused âtens of explosionsâ at Al Asad, it said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

He credited âthe precautions taken, the dispersal of forces, and an early warning system that worked very wellâ, and declared that âIran appears to be standing downâ.

The crash came just hours after the Iranian missile strike on Iraq military bases used by the US.There was no evidence that the two incidents were linked.

The crash is thought to have killed all 176 people on board.

"South Western Railway's auditor said there was ""significant doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern"" A rail firm has said it could lose its franchise after declaring a Â£137m loss. South Western Railway (SWR) said it was in talks with the government over the future of the contract, which is due to expire in 2024. The operator, owned by FirstGroup and Hong Kong-based firm MTR, said it had been affected by issues including strikes and infrastructure reliability. SWR services were disrupted for 27 days in December by the latest in a series of strikes over the future of guards. RMT union members have staged a series of strikes over the future of guards SWR's accounts,external, for the year ending 31 March 2019, showed a loss after tax of Â£136.9m. It said talks with the DfT could lead to a new contract or ""termination of the [current] contract within the next 12 months"". SWR said its owners had set aside funds for the ""maximum unavoidable loss"". A spokesman for the train operating company said: ""SWR's recent performance has been affected by issues including infrastructure reliability, timetabling delays and industrial action. ""We continue to be in ongoing and constructive discussions with the DfT."" The RMT rail union said the firm should be stripped of the franchise immediately to avoid a ""chaotic collapse"". RMT members have been involved in more than two years of strikes over a move by SWR to allow drivers to operate train doors. By Paul Clifton, BBC South transport correspondent SWR has not been balancing the books for some time. After two years of strikes by guards in the RMT union, that isn't a surprise. New trains are late, the infrastructure has been unreliable and performance has been falling for years. This railway is not doing well and most of its promises to passengers have not been met. But here, in black and white for the first time, is an acknowledgment by the new managing director, Mark Hopwood, that the company could fail. Operations could be transferred to a government controlled body. I don't think it's the most likely outcome. A new deal with revised terms is more likely. But what's clear is that the option of last resort is being actively considered. A DfT spokesperson said: ""We monitor the financial health of all our franchises closely and we expect them to meet their contractual obligations. ""The government will shortly bring forward a White Paper containing reforms recommended by the Williams Review that will put passengers first, end the complicated franchising model and simplify fares."" SWR operates routes between London Waterloo, Reading, Bristol, Exeter, Weymouth, and Portsmouth, as well as Island Line on the Isle of Wight. FirstGroup and MTR were awarded the franchise in August 2017, after outbidding previous operator Stagecoach.

"South Western Railway's auditor said there was ""significant doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern"" A rail firm has said it could lose its franchise after declaring a Â£137m loss. South Western Railway (SWR) said it was in talks with the government over the future of the contract, which is due to expire in 2024. The operator, owned by FirstGroup and Hong Kong-based firm MTR, said it had been affected by issues including strikes and infrastructure reliability. SWR services were disrupted for 27 days in December by the latest in a series of strikes over the future of guards. RMT union members have staged a series of strikes over the future of guards SWR's accounts,external, for the year ending 31 March 2019, showed a loss after tax of Â£136.9m. It said talks with the DfT could lead to a new contract or ""termination of the [current] contract within the next 12 months"". SWR said its owners had set aside funds for the ""maximum unavoidable loss"". A spokesman for the train operating company said: ""SWR's recent performance has been affected by issues including infrastructure reliability, timetabling delays and industrial action. ""We continue to be in ongoing and constructive discussions with the DfT."" The RMT rail union said the firm should be stripped of the franchise immediately to avoid a ""chaotic collapse"". RMT members have been involved in more than two years of strikes over a move by SWR to allow drivers to operate train doors. By Paul Clifton, BBC South transport correspondent SWR has not been balancing the books for some time. After two years of strikes by guards in the RMT union, that isn't a surprise. New trains are late, the infrastructure has been unreliable and performance has been falling for years. This railway is not doing well and most of its promises to passengers have not been met. But here, in black and white for the first time, is an acknowledgment by the new managing director, Mark Hopwood, that the company could fail. Operations could be transferred to a government controlled body. I don't think it's the most likely outcome. A new deal with revised terms is more likely. But what's clear is that the option of last resort is being actively considered. A DfT spokesperson said: ""We monitor the financial health of all our franchises closely and we expect them to meet their contractual obligations. ""The government will shortly bring forward a White Paper containing reforms recommended by the Williams Review that will put passengers first, end the complicated franchising model and simplify fares."" SWR operates routes between London Waterloo, Reading, Bristol, Exeter, Weymouth, and Portsmouth, as well as Island Line on the Isle of Wight. FirstGroup and MTR were awarded the franchise in August 2017, after outbidding previous operator Stagecoach.
