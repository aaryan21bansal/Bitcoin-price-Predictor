"Many New Yorkers are already wearing masks Ventilators will be taken from certain New York hospitals and redistributed to the worst-hit parts of the state under an order to be signed by Governor Andrew Cuomo. New York saw its highest single-day increase in deaths, up by 562 to 2,935 - nearly half of all virus-related US deaths recorded yesterday. The White House may advise those in virus hotspots to wear face coverings in public to help stem the spread. The US now has 245,658 Covid-19 cases. A shortage of several hundred ventilators in New York City, the epicentre of the outbreak in the US, prompted Mr Cuomo to say that he will order the machines be taken from various parts of the state and give them to harder-hit areas. Amid a deepening crisis, top health official Dr Anthony Fauci has said he believes all states should issue stay-at-home orders. ""I don't understand why that's not happening,"" Dr Fauci told CNN on Thursday. ""If you look at what's going on in this country, I just don't understand why we're not doing that."" ""You've got to put your foot on the accelerator to bring that number down,"" he added, referring to infection and death rates. Should more of us wear face masks? Why some countries wear face masks and others don't Coronavirus: Are homemade face masks safe? The comments from Dr Fauci, who heads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, appeared to contradict those of President Trump, who has consistently dismissed the notion of a nationwide lockdown. ""It's awfully tough to say, 'close it down.' We have to have a little bit of flexibility,"" Mr Trump said on Wednesday. New York state remains the epicentre of the US coronavirus outbreak with at least 102,863 positive cases. The more than 500 person spike in deaths state-wide over the past day is more than half of that reported in a single day in both Spain and Italy, the countries with greatest fatalities.

Mr Cuomo warned on Friday that people would die unnecessarily because of a lack of equipment in the areas most devastated by the outbreak. The governor said he would deploy the National Guard to enforce a new executive order giving the state authority to take and redistribute ventilators from hospitals and other healthcare institutions to facilities in parts of the state most urgently in need. These institutions will either receive their supplies back or be reimbursed, he said. ""I'm not going to let people die,"" Mr Cuomo said of the order. Mr Cuomo said this week that New York will need nearly 37,000 ventilators for the ""apex"" of the state's outbreak, expected to hit at the end of April. Bill de Blasio, the New York City mayor, said the metropolis needs 400 additional ventilators by Sunday. Both the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC)and the World Health Organization (WHO)are reassessing their guidance on face masks, as experts race to find ways to fight the highly contagious virus. Covid-19 is carried in airborne droplets from people coughing or sneezing, but there is some dispute over how far people should distance themselves from each other, and whether masks are useful when used by the public. The WHO advises that ordinary face masks are only effective if combined with careful hand-washing and social-distancing, and so far it does not recommend them generally for healthy people. However, more and more health experts now say there are benefits. They argue that the public use of masks can primarily help by preventing asymptomatic patients - people who have been infected with Covid-19 but are not aware, and not displaying any symptoms - from unknowingly spreading the virus to others. New York City has been hit harder by the virus than any other city in the US Masks may also help lower the risk of individuals catching the virus through the droplets from another person's sneeze or a cough - and people can be taught how put masks on and take them off correctly, they argue. On Thursday New York mayor Bill de Blasio urged all New Yorkers to cover their faces when outside and near others, but not to use surgical masks, which are in short supply. ""It could be a scarf. It could be something you create yourself at home. It could be a bandana,"" he said. Governor Cuomo weighed in on Friday, saying ""I think it's fair to say that the masks couldn't hurt unless they gave you a false sense of security."" Meanwhile, residents in Laredo, Texas will now face a $1,000 (Â£816) fine if they fail to cover their noses and mouths while outside, after city officials issued an emergency ordinance to its approximately 250,000 residents this week. This video can not be played âI just had a baby - now Iâm going to the frontline.â Dr Deborah Birx, one of President Trump's coronavirus advisers, expressed caution about general mask-wearing. ""We don't want people to get an artificial sense of protection,"" she said. ""They're an additive."" There is also disagreement among experts over the benefits of using cloth masks. European advisers say reusable cloth masks are not recommended and may even increase the chance of infection. At least 297 million Americans in 38 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico have been told to stay home. But the governors of 10 states have so far stopped short of asking all residents to remain indoors. North Dakota, South Dakota, Arkansas, IowaandNebraskaso far have no state-wide order urging people inside. ""A targeted approach is what is working for us in Arkansas,"" said Governor Asa Hutchinson this week. ""People are misled by this idea that this stay at home order is magical."" Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds has argued: ""I can't lock the state down... I can't lock everybody in their home."" Other states have left the decision to local officials while still refraining from any state-wide action. Residents in parts ofAlabama, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas, Utah and Wyomingface some degree of stay home orders, issued by local authorities. This video can not be played How Trump's attitude toward coronavirus has shifted ""Our state is so diverse, every segment of the state is different,"" said Missouri Governor Mike Parsons this week, defending his reticence to take such action.

"" We're not New York, we aren't even Louisiana."" In global terms the US has the most Covid-19 cases - more than 245,000. And on Thursday the US authorities said more than 1,000 had died in the past 24 hours - the highest daily toll so far in the world. Hospitals and morgues in New York are struggling to cope with the pandemic, and New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has warned that New York risks running out of ventilators for patients in six days.

"A major US mask manufacturer, 3M, says the government has asked it to stop exporting US-made N95 respirator masks to Canada and Latin America. The request had ""significant humanitarian implications"", it warned, and could prompt other countries to act in kind. On Thursday, the US invoked the Korean War-era Defence Production Act to demand that 3M provide more masks. Canada's prime minister said stopping 3M's exports would be a ""mistake"". President Donald Trump said he had used the Defence Production Act to ""hit 3M hard"", without providing additional details. The law dates back to 1950 and allows a president to force companies to make products for national defence. In a statement on Friday, 3M said the government had invoked the act ""to require 3M to prioritise orders from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) for our N95 respirators"", and had also requested that 3M import more respirators made in its overseas factories into the US. It said it supported both moves. However, 3M added that the government also requested that it stop exporting respirators made in the US to Canada and Latin America. ""There are significant humanitarian implications of ceasing respirator supplies to healthcare workers in Canada and Latin America, where we are a critical supplier of respirators,"" it said. 3M added that such a move ""would likely cause other countries to retaliate and do the same"", which would lead to the overall number of respirators being made available to the US decreasing. The company says,externalit manufactures about 100 million N95 masks per month - about a third are made in the US, and the rest produced overseas. The Trump administration has not provided details on its communications with 3M. On Thursday night, Mr Trump tweeted: ""We hit 3M hard today after seeing what they were doing with their masks... Big surprise to many in government as to what they were doing - will have a big price to pay!"" Meanwhile, White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said on Thursday: ""We've had issues making sure that all of the production that 3M does around the world, enough of it is coming back here."" This video can not be played PM Justin Trudeau says it would be a 'mistake' for the US to block medical supplies from Canada Canada does not manufacture any N95 masks,externaldomestically, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters on Friday that ""it would be a mistake to create blockages or reduce trade"".

"Each day, news of more deaths is distressing to people across the country - as well as a tragedy for the families involved. Projections of how bad the outbreak could get have prompted ministers to put the country into lockdown. But what are we learning about the impact of the virus and the deaths it is causing? The death figures being reported daily are hospital cases where a person dies with the coronavirus infection in their body - because it is a notifiable disease cases have to be reported. But what the figures do not tell us is to what extent the virus is causing the death. It could be the major cause, a contributory factor or simply present when they are dying of something else. For example, an 18-year-old in Coventry tested positive for coronavirus the day before he died and was reported as its youngest victim at the time. But the hospital subsequently released a statement saying his death had been due to a separate ""significant"" health condition and not connected to the virus. There are, however, other cases, including health workers, where people have died with no known health conditions. The Office for National Statisticshas tried to shed light on this,external. It looked at nearly 4,000 deaths in England and Wales during March. There were two main findings. Firstly, the virus was the cause of the majority of deaths, not other factors. But secondly, nine in 10 did have pre-existing illnesses, such as heart disease and respiratory problems that put them at heightened risk of death anyway. It is clear that the number of people who are dying is increasing. The ONS has started to track this as well on a weekly basis - and unlike the daily government figures, which largely focus on hospital deaths, it is taking into account deaths in the community. Themost recent data,externalgoes up to the start of April. It shows in the week ending 3 April there were 16,000 deaths - 6,000 more than could be expected at this time of the year when the number of deaths normally starts to fall with winter over. This is the highest death number since these figures were first published in 2005, more than the previous peak seen during the bad flu outbreak of 2015. Not all these extra deaths were down to coronavirus, but a significant number were. What we do not know is what will happen to these numbers in the future and whether in a few months time deaths will drop below expected levels. If that happened, it would suggest coronavirus has brought forward deaths that you would expect to happen over the course of the next year. Every year, about 600,000 people in the UK die. And the frail and elderly are most at risk, just as they are if they have coronavirus. Nearly 10% of people aged over 80 will die in the next year, Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter at the University of Cambridge points out, and the risk of them dying if infected with coronavirus is almost exactly the same. That does not mean there will be no extra deaths - but, Sir David says, there will be ""a substantial overlap"". ""Many people who die of Covid [the disease caused by coronavirus] would have died anyway within a short period,"" he says. Knowing exactly how many is impossible to tell at this stage. Prof Neil Ferguson, the lead modeller at Imperial College London, has suggested it could be up to two-thirds. But while deaths without the virus would be spread over the course of a year, those with the virus could come more quickly - that, of course, was the logic for the lockdown to stop the health service being overwhelmed. When it comes to flu, experts track what are called excess deaths. During recent winters, there have been about 17,000 excess deaths a year, Public Health England says. This, of course, can be done in the future only - it is why the ONS says it is too early to understand the true impact coronavirus is having on deaths. Work also needs to be done to calculate the indirect impact of coronavirus and the lockdown. The 6,000 extra weekly deaths identified by the ONS contained 2,500 which were not reported to be because of coronavirus infections. Experts have suggested they could be related to people being deterred from seeking treatment for medical emergencies such as strokes or heart attacks. This is why the UK government's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty was stressing on Thursday the ""NHS was open for business"". Prof Robert Dingwall from Nottingham Trent University says there will certainly be ""collateral damage"" from other factors such as: mental health problems and suicides linked to self-isolation heart problems from lack of activity the impact on health from increased unemployment and reduced living standards Others have also pointed to the health cost from steps such as delaying routine operations and cancer screening. Meanwhile, University of Bristol researchers say the benefit of a long-term lockdown in reducing premature deaths could be outweighed by the lost life expectancy from a prolonged economic dip. And the tipping point, they say, is a 6.4% decline in the size of the economy - on a par with what happened following the 2008 financial crash. It would see a loss of three months of life on average across the population because of factors such declining living standards and poorer health care. The problem the government and its advisers face is that they cannot make decisions with the benefit of hindsight - they have to react to emerging evidence. Currently, the lockdown is aimed at suppressing the spread of the virus. Once the peak has passed decisions will have to be made about what to do next. The virus will not simply have gone away, and with a vaccine at least a year away the challenge will be how to manage it. A balance will need to be struck between keeping it at bay and trying to control its spread to avoid a second peak, while at the same time allowing the country to return to normal. Seeing the full picture in terms of lives saved and lives lost will be essential in getting those calls right. LATEST:Live coverage of developments EASY STEPS:What can I do?

"Ian Wilson died from Covid-19 two days after being taken into hospital After being told her husband was dying from Covid-19, Sandra Wilson heard the doctor crying down the phone. ""He explained that I wouldn't be able to visit him and that he would look after him as if he was his own father or grandfather,"" she said. ""But there was nothing they could do to make him better."" Ian Wilson, 72, died two days after being taken into hospital on 27 March. Sandra, 59, had cared for him for two weeks at their home in Coatbridge as he battled a high temperature and delirium. He also had a heart condition and diabetes. Initially she was not allowed to visit him - but once the severity of Ian's condition became apparent, hospital staff granted her access provided she wore protective equipment. The decision meant Sandra was by Ian's side when he died. She told the BBC she was struck by how acutely NHS staff were affected, not only by Ian's death, but by their inability to comfort grieving families because of social distancing protocol. ""It was difficult after he had died,"" Sandra said. ""I left the room and told the nurse what had happened and she came towards me as if to cuddle me, then stopped and reversed. ""She apologised and said 'I can't even pat you on the shoulder'. I left, there was nothing else I could do."" When Ian first became unwell, he did not show signs of the most well-known symptoms of Covid-19, according to Sandra. ""We thought he had a urinary tract infection,"" she said. ""The hospital at home team suspected it was Covid-19 but I was still confused by it because he hadn't coughed. ""A few days later they tested him and it came back positive. He had been unwell for over a week before we knew that it was Covid-19."" Later the family had to decide whether or not to send Ian to hospital. Sandra knew visiting would be difficult and did not want him to be in a strange environment during his spells of delirium. She said she was lucky to have been by Ian's side eventually, but fears other families will have a far more difficult hospital experience. Almost half of NHS Scotland staff absences Covid-19 related Acts of kindness helping the NHS She said: ""It's a very strange situation but I'm very, very grateful to the nurses and doctors that made it possible for me to visit. ""I feel sorry for people in the future who won't be able to. Ian was in a ward where there were only three patients, but as they wards fill up they'll not be able to let everybody in."" After saying goodbye to her husband, Sandra was unable to see her children in person as she had to undergo a period of self-isolation. The family will also have to travel to the crematorium in separate cars and cannot be in close contact during the service. But Sandra has been taking comfort in the letters, cards and well-wishings sent from loved ones who will not be able to attend Ian's funeral. As a school janitor, he was remembered fondly by pupils as well as friends and family. Sandra said: ""I've had many many phone calls so it has helped to talk. ""Normally you would tell stories about people at the funeral, but because they can't do that, some have been writing wee stories on cards."" Sandra hopes her family's story will encourage people to ""stay at home and protect the NHS"" and remains grateful to the health care staff who allowed her to watch over her husband until the end. ""It gave me time to come to terms with the inevitable,"" she said. ""I was able to talk to him and just say goodbye. I've got strength from that.""

"New Look says it is suspending payments to suppliers for existing stock ""indefinitely"", telling them in a letter that the stock can be collected by its owners. The retailer is also cancelling orders for its Spring and Summer clothing lines and won't pay costs towards them. New Look told the BBC it did not take the decision lightly. ""This is a matter of survival,"" it told suppliers. One small firm said New Lookâs behaviour was âtotally out of orderâ. The supplier, which provides clothing for several High Street chains and did not want its name published, told the BBC it was not currently owed money by New Look and had no outstanding orders with the retailer. However, it added that New Lookâs approach would âdevastate smaller companies down the supply chain at a time when they need help the mostâ. New Lookâs instructions to suppliers came in the form of a letter, signed by chief executive Nigel Oddy and dated 2 April, which has been seen by the BBC. All New Look stores have been closed since 21 March. The firm said it was still trading online, but its distribution centre was full and it could receive no more goods. âWe are acutely aware that our suppliers are facing their own challenges at this time, and that both their businesses and employees are being affected,â Mr Oddy wrote in his letter. âGovernment support schemes continue to be announced throughout the world, and we encourage you to pursue any options that are available to you.â A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak STRESS:How to look after your mental health The supplier who contacted the BBC said small firms could not afford to trade in those circumstances and accused New Look of âpassing all the risk on to the supply chainâ. The firm said it, and others like it, had its designs manufactured in China and could not afford to take on all the liability by itself. It added: âThe new reality in China is that factories now insist on deposits for all orders placed on behalf of grocers and large retailers, as they cannot afford orders to be cancelled with no compensation to cover raw materials and production.â The firm called on those big retailers to âplay their part in helping the whole supply chain by paying these deposits up front at the point of orderâ. âSince the middle of March, our revenue has collapsed from Â£160,000 per day to virtually nothing, as almost all of our retail customers in the UK have chosen or had to close for the foreseeable future,â the supplier said, adding that it had already furloughed 90% of its staff. New Look was already facing difficulties before the coronavirus pandemic struck. It closed dozens of stores in 2018 and 2019 because of âchallengingâ retail conditions on the High Street. A New Look spokesperson said: ""Whilst our online sales channels remain open, albeit on a significantly reduced basis, we have regrettably had to inform suppliers that we cannot place new orders until further notice and will be temporarily postponing outstanding supplier payments until the situation improves."" ""We have not taken this decision lightly and have only done so out of absolute necessity, given the exceptional circumstances we are in. We greatly value our relationships with suppliers and are actively identifying opportunities where they can hold product for use for autumn-winter this year or spring-summer next year.""

"Some clubs have furloughed non-playing staff before any reduction to players' wages Premier League clubs will ask players to take a 30% pay cut in order to protect jobs as it was announced the season will not resume until ""it is safe and appropriate to do so"". All clubs have agreed to put the proposed ""combination of conditional reductions and deferrals"" to players. The Premier League will advance Â£125m to the EFL and National League, and give Â£20m towards the NHS. Clubs still intend on completing all league and cup fixtures. The EFL, Women's Super League and Women's Championship have all suspended play without setting a target return date, meaning the entirety of English football is on hold indefinitely. ""It was acknowledged that the Premier League will not resume at the beginning of May - and that the 2019-20 season will only return when it is safe and appropriate to do so,"" a Premier League statement said. ""Any return to play will only be with the full support of government and when medical guidance allows."" What are Premier League and English football's options amid coronavirus? Hearts: No player asked to take more than 30% cut - Ann Budge Players had faced scrutiny, notably from health secretary Matt Hancock, to take a cut in wages and""play their part""in offering support during the coronavirus pandemic. Some clubs had furloughed non-playing staff as a result of the shutdown of the sport. Before the Premier League statement was released, club captains - led by Liverpool skipper Jordan Henderson -held discussionsover the creation of a charitable fund which could benefit the NHS. The Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) has previously written to its members urging them not to agree any reduction or deferral in wages until they have spoken to the union. After a meeting of clubs on Friday, the Premier League proposed a cut in wages in order to ""protect employment throughout the professional game"". ""This guidance will be kept under constant review as circumstances change,"" the Premier League said. ""The league will be in regular contact with the PFA and the union will join a meeting which will be held tomorrow (Saturday) between the league, players and club representatives."" Crystal Palace winger Andros Townsend had spoken of his frustration with Hancock ""deflecting blame on to footballers"", stating players were an ""easy target"" and often supported charities. The Premier League said it was aware of ""severe difficulties"" throughout the football pyramid and with clubs unable to play fixtures, moved to help ""immediately deal with the impact of falling cash flow"" at EFL and National League clubs. Julian Knight, chair of the government's Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee, welcomed the financial help for smaller clubs but said as the wage cut had not yet been agreed by players, the situation was ""not much further along"". Knight had previously said clubs that furlough non-playing staff without imposing cuts on player wages should be subjected to a windfall tax if they do not change their approach by Tuesday. Sports Minister Nigel Huddleston said: ""It is absolutely right that a reduction of players' wages is on the table when there are lower-paid staff at some clubs being furloughed. ""The football authorities must all be aware of the strength of public feeling on this and I expect them to show leadership on the matter. ""It is important that the Premier League helps the national effort in response to the coronavirus pandemic and I will continue to work closely with the football authorities."" The league's statement also expressed ""huge appreciation for the heroic efforts of NHS staff and all other key workers who are carrying out critical jobs in such difficult circumstances"" with Â£20m immediately committed ""to support the NHS, communities, families and vulnerable groups during the Covid-19 pandemic"". BBC Sport football reporter Simon Stone England's football bodies decided they had little option other than to extend the current suspension. It means the FA Cup will be stuck at the quarter-final stage for a bit longer, promotion and relegation issues are unresolved and Liverpool nervously await the chance to complete their first league title triumph since 1990. But while nothing seems to be happening, plenty of conversations are occurring and scenarios for concluding the historic 2019-20 season are being discussed. Fundamentally though, these are the five options on the table: 1.  Null and void the season 2.  End the season now 3.  Set a deadline for completion 4.  Play behind closed doors 5.

"Debenhams, the department store chain, is facing administration for a second time. The retailer is set to appoint administrators as early next week to protect the company against claims from creditors as it tries to restructure its business. Debenhams has already closed 22 stores this year and plans to shut a further 28 in 2021. However, the coronavirus outbreak has ramped up pressure on the firm. Like much of the rest of the High Street, Debenhams 142 stores are closed. Although the business is still trading online, it has a large amount of stock which it cannot sell. What does it mean to declare insolvency? Coronavirus: Four ways the economy has been affected It is understood that Debenhams is concerned about potential legal claims from suppliers who have yet to be paid. A Debenhams spokesperson said: ""Like all retailers, Debenhams is making contingency plans reflecting the extraordinary current circumstances. ""Our owners and lenders remain highly supportive and whatever actions we may take will be with a view to protecting the business during the current situation."" This video can not be played Declaring insolvency: What it means It is expected that the most likely outcome is a pre-pack administration, where a company arranges to sell its business to a pre-determined buyer before administrators are appointed. Last April, Debenhams fell into the hands of its lenders, comprising a group of banks and hedge funds led by US firm Silver Point Capital, after struggling for years to keep up with competition from rivals. It has also faced rising costs in running its big stores as well as grappling with a huge amount of debt. A source familiar with the company's current thinking told the BBC that if a pre-pack was to happen, the current owners intend to take the business out of administration once stores are allowed to re-open and were in talks to inject funding as part of its existing turnaround plan. Landlords have already been told that a number of restructuring scenarios are being explored, which have ""varying outcomes"" for the business, landlords and Debenhams' 20,000 workers.

"Some footpaths have already been closed Some farmers say they fear their families could be put at risk of coronavirus due to an increase in walkers using footpaths on their land. Under official guidance people can go for a walk or run close to home once a day. But some farmers say paths should be closed or diverted because of fears it could be spread unwittingly via stiles and gates. The Welsh Government said it had already shut some of the busiest paths. This includes popular paths in Snowdonia and the Breacon Beacons, where crowdsflocked for exercise at the start of the restrictions, despite social-distancing warnings. Allow Twitter content?

Jacob Anthony said he normally loved greeting walkers but was worried for his family and livestock Jacob Anthony, who farms near Bridgend, said he had seen a significant increase in walkers coming through his farmland since the measures were introduced. He said while he usually enjoyed speaking to walkers on his land he was worried they may be unknowingly spreading the virus, and worried it could harm his loved ones, and the livestock, especially during the lambing season. ""My grandad is 87, is still farming, my sister is asthmatic and my mother has an auto-immune disease and we really don't want to be catching this virus,"" he said. Caravan parks, campsites and tourist hotspots closed in Wales 'Unprecedented' crowds in Wales despite warnings ""We've seen some motorbikes and families with young children as well as beer cans on the mountains so it looks like people have been drinking up here too,"" he said. ""Farmers can't go into hibernation, we have to work, and the countryside is our office. ""If we're sick there's nobody to look after the animals."" Farmer Kate Beavan said there had been a drop in the number of walkers through land, and more were using roads Kate Beavan, a farmer near Abergavenny, said while she appreciated how lucky she was to have so much outdoor space, when some people were stuck inside without gardens, people needed to think before they ventured to the countryside. ""Walkers will be welcomed back here with open arms when this craziness is over, we are just asking for a bit of thought for vulnerable farming families at this time. I think the majority of people are understanding,"" she said. Hedd Pugh said he found a walker from Shropshire on his farm The National Farmers' Union (NFU) in Wales said there had been a ""significant increase"" in people using paths, and called on the Welsh Government to act. NFU Cymru's Hedd Pugh said he found a walker from Shrewsbury on his farmland, near Dinas Mawddwy, Gwynedd, who was unaware of the guidance to stay close to home to exercise. ""Farmers have observed a significant increase in the use of public rights of way and access land in the light of the social distancing guidelines introduced during the Covid-19 pandemic. ""This has led to concerns and anxiety where public rights of way are in close proximity to homes and farmyards, particularly so in instances where farmers or members of their families fall into the vulnerable category. Farmers fear people walking on the footpaths could unknowingly be spreading the virus The Welsh Government said it had introduced regulations forcing councils, National Park Authorities, Natural Resources Wales and the National Trust to close certain footpaths. ""The busiest locations, where large numbers of people gather, have been closed,"" he said. ""The regulations also allow the closure of paths if their use poses a high risk to the incidence or spread of infection in their areas. ""The decision on closing paths rests with these authorities as they possess the local knowledge to understand where a closure is necessary."" The Welsh Conservatives' rural affairs spokesman Andrew RT Davies said some footpaths crossed people's homes and gardens. ""Families and farmers are both telling me they are getting scared that an influx of people - in some cases more than they've seen before - could spread this virus to them,"" he said. The UK's largest walkers' group, The Ramblers, said it has asked people to respect the closures. ""We have joined with other prominent outdoor organisations in writing to the Welsh Government urging them to keep a focus on helping people to safely access local exercise opportunities near to their homes, while also guarding against unnecessary or inappropriate path and green space closures,"" it said.

"Many New Yorkers are already wearing masks Ventilators will be taken from certain New York hospitals and redistributed to the worst-hit parts of the state under an order to be signed by Governor Andrew Cuomo. New York saw its highest single-day increase in deaths, up by 562 to 2,935 - nearly half of all virus-related US deaths recorded yesterday. The White House may advise those in virus hotspots to wear face coverings in public to help stem the spread. The US now has 245,658 Covid-19 cases. A shortage of several hundred ventilators in New York City, the epicentre of the outbreak in the US, prompted Mr Cuomo to say that he will order the machines be taken from various parts of the state and give them to harder-hit areas. Amid a deepening crisis, top health official Dr Anthony Fauci has said he believes all states should issue stay-at-home orders. ""I don't understand why that's not happening,"" Dr Fauci told CNN on Thursday. ""If you look at what's going on in this country, I just don't understand why we're not doing that."" ""You've got to put your foot on the accelerator to bring that number down,"" he added, referring to infection and death rates. Should more of us wear face masks? Why some countries wear face masks and others don't Coronavirus: Are homemade face masks safe? The comments from Dr Fauci, who heads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, appeared to contradict those of President Trump, who has consistently dismissed the notion of a nationwide lockdown. ""It's awfully tough to say, 'close it down.' We have to have a little bit of flexibility,"" Mr Trump said on Wednesday. New York state remains the epicentre of the US coronavirus outbreak with at least 102,863 positive cases. The more than 500 person spike in deaths state-wide over the past day is more than half of that reported in a single day in both Spain and Italy, the countries with greatest fatalities. This video can not be played NY governor signs executive order to redistribute ventilators New York City is the worst-hit area of the state, with 1,562 deaths,Johns Hopkins University reports,external. Mr Cuomo warned on Friday that people would die unnecessarily because of a lack of equipment in the areas most devastated by the outbreak. The governor said he would deploy the National Guard to enforce a new executive order giving the state authority to take and redistribute ventilators from hospitals and other healthcare institutions to facilities in parts of the state most urgently in need. These institutions will either receive their supplies back or be reimbursed, he said. ""I'm not going to let people die,"" Mr Cuomo said of the order. Mr Cuomo said this week that New York will need nearly 37,000 ventilators for the ""apex"" of the state's outbreak, expected to hit at the end of April. Bill de Blasio, the New York City mayor, said the metropolis needs 400 additional ventilators by Sunday. Both the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC)and the World Health Organization (WHO)are reassessing their guidance on face masks, as experts race to find ways to fight the highly contagious virus. Covid-19 is carried in airborne droplets from people coughing or sneezing, but there is some dispute over how far people should distance themselves from each other, and whether masks are useful when used by the public. The WHO advises that ordinary face masks are only effective if combined with careful hand-washing and social-distancing, and so far it does not recommend them generally for healthy people. However, more and more health experts now say there are benefits. They argue that the public use of masks can primarily help by preventing asymptomatic patients - people who have been infected with Covid-19 but are not aware, and not displaying any symptoms - from unknowingly spreading the virus to others. New York City has been hit harder by the virus than any other city in the US Masks may also help lower the risk of individuals catching the virus through the droplets from another person's sneeze or a cough - and people can be taught how put masks on and take them off correctly, they argue. On Thursday New York mayor Bill de Blasio urged all New Yorkers to cover their faces when outside and near others, but not to use surgical masks, which are in short supply. ""It could be a scarf. It could be something you create yourself at home. It could be a bandana,"" he said. Governor Cuomo weighed in on Friday, saying ""I think it's fair to say that the masks couldn't hurt unless they gave you a false sense of security."" Meanwhile, residents in Laredo, Texas will now face a $1,000 (Â£816) fine if they fail to cover their noses and mouths while outside, after city officials issued an emergency ordinance to its approximately 250,000 residents this week. This video can not be played âI just had a baby - now Iâm going to the frontline.â Dr Deborah Birx, one of President Trump's coronavirus advisers, expressed caution about general mask-wearing. ""We don't want people to get an artificial sense of protection,"" she said. ""They're an additive."" There is also disagreement among experts over the benefits of using cloth masks. European advisers say reusable cloth masks are not recommended and may even increase the chance of infection. At least 297 million Americans in 38 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico have been told to stay home. But the governors of 10 states have so far stopped short of asking all residents to remain indoors. North Dakota, South Dakota, Arkansas, IowaandNebraskaso far have no state-wide order urging people inside. ""A targeted approach is what is working for us in Arkansas,"" said Governor Asa Hutchinson this week. ""People are misled by this idea that this stay at home order is magical."" Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds has argued: ""I can't lock the state down... I can't lock everybody in their home."" Other states have left the decision to local officials while still refraining from any state-wide action. Residents in parts ofAlabama, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas, Utah and Wyomingface some degree of stay home orders, issued by local authorities. This video can not be played How Trump's attitude toward coronavirus has shifted ""Our state is so diverse, every segment of the state is different,"" said Missouri Governor Mike Parsons this week, defending his reticence to take such action. ""It's very difficult sometimes to just put a blanket order in place."" ""Y'all, we are not California,"" said Alabama Governor Kay Ivey to reporters. "" We're not New York, we aren't even Louisiana."" In global terms the US has the most Covid-19 cases - more than 245,000. And on Thursday the US authorities said more than 1,000 had died in the past 24 hours - the highest daily toll so far in the world. Hospitals and morgues in New York are struggling to cope with the pandemic, and New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has warned that New York risks running out of ventilators for patients in six days. An emergency field hospital now stands in Central Park, and another makeshift hospital is to be set up in the city's Javits Center, a conference venue. The White House has ordered car firms to switch rapidly to ventilator production. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

"Angie Stevens said she was using her drawings to show the pandemic through her own eyes and show a family ""muddling along"" A mother has been contacted by families across the globe after sketching her children's daily life in isolation. Every day Angie Stevens has been sketching her three children, husband and pets at their home in Swansea. The sketches show her daughters painting a rainbow in the window, her son washing his hands and their dog lying in toilet roll.

"Debenhams, the department store chain, is facing administration for a second time. The retailer is set to appoint administrators as early next week to protect the company against claims from creditors as it tries to restructure its business. Debenhams has already closed 22 stores this year and plans to shut a further 28 in 2021. However, the coronavirus outbreak has ramped up pressure on the firm. Like much of the rest of the High Street, Debenhams 142 stores are closed. Although the business is still trading online, it has a large amount of stock which it cannot sell. What does it mean to declare insolvency? Coronavirus: Four ways the economy has been affected It is understood that Debenhams is concerned about potential legal claims from suppliers who have yet to be paid. A Debenhams spokesperson said: ""Like all retailers, Debenhams is making contingency plans reflecting the extraordinary current circumstances. ""Our owners and lenders remain highly supportive and whatever actions we may take will be with a view to protecting the business during the current situation."" This video can not be played Declaring insolvency: What it means It is expected that the most likely outcome is a pre-pack administration, where a company arranges to sell its business to a pre-determined buyer before administrators are appointed. Last April, Debenhams fell into the hands of its lenders, comprising a group of banks and hedge funds led by US firm Silver Point Capital, after struggling for years to keep up with competition from rivals. It has also faced rising costs in running its big stores as well as grappling with a huge amount of debt. A source familiar with the company's current thinking told the BBC that if a pre-pack was to happen, the current owners intend to take the business out of administration once stores are allowed to re-open and were in talks to inject funding as part of its existing turnaround plan. Landlords have already been told that a number of restructuring scenarios are being explored, which have ""varying outcomes"" for the business, landlords and Debenhams' 20,000 workers.

"New Look says it is suspending payments to suppliers for existing stock ""indefinitely"", telling them in a letter that the stock can be collected by its owners. The retailer is also cancelling orders for its Spring and Summer clothing lines and won't pay costs towards them. New Look told the BBC it did not take the decision lightly. ""This is a matter of survival,"" it told suppliers. One small firm said New Lookâs behaviour was âtotally out of orderâ. The supplier, which provides clothing for several High Street chains and did not want its name published, told the BBC it was not currently owed money by New Look and had no outstanding orders with the retailer. However, it added that New Lookâs approach would âdevastate smaller companies down the supply chain at a time when they need help the mostâ. New Lookâs instructions to suppliers came in the form of a letter, signed by chief executive Nigel Oddy and dated 2 April, which has been seen by the BBC. All New Look stores have been closed since 21 March. The firm said it was still trading online, but its distribution centre was full and it could receive no more goods. âWe are acutely aware that our suppliers are facing their own challenges at this time, and that both their businesses and employees are being affected,â Mr Oddy wrote in his letter. âGovernment support schemes continue to be announced throughout the world, and we encourage you to pursue any options that are available to you.â A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak STRESS:How to look after your mental health The supplier who contacted the BBC said small firms could not afford to trade in those circumstances and accused New Look of âpassing all the risk on to the supply chainâ. The firm said it, and others like it, had its designs manufactured in China and could not afford to take on all the liability by itself. It added: âThe new reality in China is that factories now insist on deposits for all orders placed on behalf of grocers and large retailers, as they cannot afford orders to be cancelled with no compensation to cover raw materials and production.â The firm called on those big retailers to âplay their part in helping the whole supply chain by paying these deposits up front at the point of orderâ. âSince the middle of March, our revenue has collapsed from Â£160,000 per day to virtually nothing, as almost all of our retail customers in the UK have chosen or had to close for the foreseeable future,â the supplier said, adding that it had already furloughed 90% of its staff. New Look was already facing difficulties before the coronavirus pandemic struck. It closed dozens of stores in 2018 and 2019 because of âchallengingâ retail conditions on the High Street. A New Look spokesperson said: ""Whilst our online sales channels remain open, albeit on a significantly reduced basis, we have regrettably had to inform suppliers that we cannot place new orders until further notice and will be temporarily postponing outstanding supplier payments until the situation improves."" ""We have not taken this decision lightly and have only done so out of absolute necessity, given the exceptional circumstances we are in.

Daniel HollandLocal Democracy Reporter The closure of Newcastle's three tips because of coronavirus lockdown and social distancing measures has lead to a spate of fly-tipping and illegal bonfires. Culprits have been warned the Covid-19 crisis is not an âautomatic permitâ to dump their rubbish wherever they want. Newcastle City Council cabinet member Nick Kemp said: âItâs taking away valuable resources from our already stretched bin crews, who are being diverted away to clean it up while at the same time continuing to provide every resident their usual collections."" Residents have been urged not to hire anyone to take their bulky rubbish away while the tips remain shut. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics The UK death toll from coronavirusjumped by 684 in 24 hours to 3,605. This looks like further evidence that the case numbers could be slowing down (as long as every patient who needs testing is getting tested). Today's figures on deaths follow the recent trends closely (doubling roughly every 3.5 days). It takes more than three weeks from infection to death to being reported in these figures. So while we can hope to see the effects of pre-lockdown social distancing soon, it will take longer for the effect of the lockdown, announced on 23 March, to become apparent. Colourful murals thanking the NHS and key workers for their efforts have appeared on the walls of pubs in Pontefract. The artworks, by Rachel List, have been painted on the gates of the Hope & Anchor (above), in Baileygate, and on the side of the Horse Vaults (below), in Horse Fair.

Daniel HollandLocal Democracy Reporter The closure of Newcastle's three tips because of coronavirus lockdown and social distancing measures has lead to a spate of fly-tipping and illegal bonfires. Culprits have been warned the Covid-19 crisis is not an âautomatic permitâ to dump their rubbish wherever they want. Newcastle City Council cabinet member Nick Kemp said: âItâs taking away valuable resources from our already stretched bin crews, who are being diverted away to clean it up while at the same time continuing to provide every resident their usual collections."" Residents have been urged not to hire anyone to take their bulky rubbish away while the tips remain shut. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics The UK death toll from coronavirusjumped by 684 in 24 hours to 3,605. This looks like further evidence that the case numbers could be slowing down (as long as every patient who needs testing is getting tested). Today's figures on deaths follow the recent trends closely (doubling roughly every 3.5 days). It takes more than three weeks from infection to death to being reported in these figures. So while we can hope to see the effects of pre-lockdown social distancing soon, it will take longer for the effect of the lockdown, announced on 23 March, to become apparent. Colourful murals thanking the NHS and key workers for their efforts have appeared on the walls of pubs in Pontefract. The artworks, by Rachel List, have been painted on the gates of the Hope & Anchor (above), in Baileygate, and on the side of the Horse Vaults (below), in Horse Fair.

"Some clubs have furloughed non-playing staff before any reduction to players' wages Premier League clubs will ask players to take a 30% pay cut in order to protect jobs as it was announced the season will not resume until ""it is safe and appropriate to do so"". All clubs have agreed to put the proposed ""combination of conditional reductions and deferrals"" to players. The Premier League will advance Â£125m to the EFL and National League, and give Â£20m towards the NHS. Clubs still intend on completing all league and cup fixtures. The EFL, Women's Super League and Women's Championship have all suspended play without setting a target return date, meaning the entirety of English football is on hold indefinitely. ""It was acknowledged that the Premier League will not resume at the beginning of May - and that the 2019-20 season will only return when it is safe and appropriate to do so,"" a Premier League statement said. ""Any return to play will only be with the full support of government and when medical guidance allows."" What are Premier League and English football's options amid coronavirus? Hearts: No player asked to take more than 30% cut - Ann Budge Players had faced scrutiny, notably from health secretary Matt Hancock, to take a cut in wages and""play their part""in offering support during the coronavirus pandemic. Some clubs had furloughed non-playing staff as a result of the shutdown of the sport. Before the Premier League statement was released, club captains - led by Liverpool skipper Jordan Henderson -held discussionsover the creation of a charitable fund which could benefit the NHS. The Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) has previously written to its members urging them not to agree any reduction or deferral in wages until they have spoken to the union. After a meeting of clubs on Friday, the Premier League proposed a cut in wages in order to ""protect employment throughout the professional game"". ""This guidance will be kept under constant review as circumstances change,"" the Premier League said. ""The league will be in regular contact with the PFA and the union will join a meeting which will be held tomorrow (Saturday) between the league, players and club representatives."" Crystal Palace winger Andros Townsend had spoken of his frustration with Hancock ""deflecting blame on to footballers"", stating players were an ""easy target"" and often supported charities. The Premier League said it was aware of ""severe difficulties"" throughout the football pyramid and with clubs unable to play fixtures, moved to help ""immediately deal with the impact of falling cash flow"" at EFL and National League clubs. Julian Knight, chair of the government's Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee, welcomed the financial help for smaller clubs but said as the wage cut had not yet been agreed by players, the situation was ""not much further along"". Knight had previously said clubs that furlough non-playing staff without imposing cuts on player wages should be subjected to a windfall tax if they do not change their approach by Tuesday. Sports Minister Nigel Huddleston said: ""It is absolutely right that a reduction of players' wages is on the table when there are lower-paid staff at some clubs being furloughed. ""The football authorities must all be aware of the strength of public feeling on this and I expect them to show leadership on the matter. ""It is important that the Premier League helps the national effort in response to the coronavirus pandemic and I will continue to work closely with the football authorities."" The league's statement also expressed ""huge appreciation for the heroic efforts of NHS staff and all other key workers who are carrying out critical jobs in such difficult circumstances"" with Â£20m immediately committed ""to support the NHS, communities, families and vulnerable groups during the Covid-19 pandemic"". BBC Sport football reporter Simon Stone England's football bodies decided they had little option other than to extend the current suspension. It means the FA Cup will be stuck at the quarter-final stage for a bit longer, promotion and relegation issues are unresolved and Liverpool nervously await the chance to complete their first league title triumph since 1990. But while nothing seems to be happening, plenty of conversations are occurring and scenarios for concluding the historic 2019-20 season are being discussed. Fundamentally though, these are the five options on the table: 1.  Null and void the season 2.  End the season now 3.  Set a deadline for completion 4.  Play behind closed doors 5.

"Police were called to reports of a burglary on Grasmere Road in Oldham Thieves tricked a 92-year-old woman into believing her neighbour had died of coronavirus so they could raid her home. They knocked on her door in Oldham, Greater Manchester, lied about the death and offered to clean the house. They presented themselves as a ""helping hand"" police said, but they stole a purse, money and jewellery. Ch Insp Trevor Harrison, from Greater Manchester Police, described it as an appalling crime. The victim was not injured, but was left ""understandably distraught"" by the theft in Grasmere Road.

"Teachers in England will be asked to assess the grades they think pupils would have achieved in cancelled GCSE and A-level exams. This will be used by exam boards to decide results - along with a ranking by ability of pupils in each subject in a school, also judged by teachers. This approach from the qualifications watchdog Ofqual will replace exams disrupted by the coronavirus outbreak. Results days will be no later than originally planned and may be earlier. ""Our overriding aim in this is to be fair to students this summer and to make sure you are not disadvantaged,"" said Sally Collier, Ofqual's chief executive. Teachers to estimate exam grades in Scotland Teachers in England to predict grades after exams cancelled Further exams cancelled in Northern Ireland Paul Whiteman, leader of the National Association of Head Teachers, said there was no ""perfect solution"". But he said the substitute plan was ""pragmatic and the fairest approach to take in these exceptional circumstances"". Sir Peter Lampl, founder of the Sutton Trust social mobility charity, warned that ""teacher assessments can unconsciously disadvantage those from low-income backgrounds"". In Scotland,grades will be estimated by teachersand the Scottish Qualifications Authority says that coursework which has already been submitted by pupils will not count towards results In Wales, teachers will estimate grades, but there will not be an extra exam in the autumn. In Northern Ireland, details are expected to be published later with plans for cancelled exams Teachers' predictions for A-levels, AS-levels and GCSEs in England will be based on the evidence available - such as previous exam results, tests, homework, coursework, mock exams and what the regulator calls ""general progress during your course"". Teachers will be asked to say what they think would have been the grades most likely to have been achieved if the summer exams had taken place - based on an overall professional judgement. But they will also be asked to put students in order of expected achievement within each predicted grade band. This will be used to moderate the overall share of grades in schools across the country. This could mean adjusting the grades suggested by teachers if they seem too generous or harsh, or unlikely in the context of previous results at a school - and to make the overall distribution of grades consistent with other years. Schools will not be allowed to tell students the grades submitted to exam boards or how they are ranked. If pupils think they could improve on the grades given to them, there are proposals for an alternative exam in the autumn. This could be too late for A-level students intending to go to university this year - although it remains uncertain whether campuses will be able to re-open for the autumn term. Mary Bousted, joint leader of the National Education Union, welcomed the news that ""grades won't be based on mock exam results, or any other single piece of evidence alone"". But she said teachers could be ""uncomfortable"" with putting students into rank order. The results will be available to students no later than the planned dates in August - but Ofqual suggested that they may be available sooner. A process for appeals has still to be decided. It also remains uncertain how grades will be decided for pupils who are home-taught and do not have links with schools that could send in predicted grades. Alternative plans for vocational qualifications will be announced at a later date. In Wales, teachers will predict grades and rank students - but the option of an extra exam in the autumn will not be available. Philip Baker, chief executive of Qualifications Wales, said: ""We want centres to consider each learner's performance over the course of study and make a realistic judgement of the grade and rank of each learner."" England's Education Secretary, Gavin Williamson, said cancelling exams had been a ""necessary step to help fight the spread of coronavirus"". But he said Ofqual's plans would provide ""assurance to students, parents and schools that grades awarded this summer will accurately reflect students' abilities and will be as valid this year as any other"".

"The UK's newest, and largest, hospital facility has taken in its first coronavirus patients needing intensive care treatment. East London's ExCeL exhibition centre, which normally plays host to lifestyle shows, expos and conferences, has been converted into the temporary NHS Nightingale hospital, with space for 4,000 beds. In nine days, the 87,328 square metres of double exhibition halls have been fitted out with the framework for about 80 wards, each with 42 beds. Some 500 fully-equipped beds, with oxygen and ventilators, are already in place and there is space for another 3,500. If it did reach capacity, it would be one of the largest hospitals in the world. Each ward is named after a different British doctor, nurse or other medical professional. The first two wards to open will be named Lady Harriett Acland and Ethel Bedford-Fenwick after two nurses whose work in the 18th and 19th centuries paved the way for modern nursing. The facility, which was officially opened on 3 April, was built with the help of up to 200 soldiers a day from the Royal Anglian Regiment and Royal Gurkha Rifles, working long shifts alongside NHS staff and contractors. Timelapsevideo of NHS Nightingale being built Architects and engineers from BDP, the firm that helped convert the centre, were part of the planning team given the task of creating the life-saving facility. BDP Principal James Hepburn said the scale and timeframe for the construction were unlike previous healthcare projects and architects were coming up with designs almost as building needed to get under way. The framework for individual bed bays were made from material usually used to make exhibition stands - because it is lightweight and could be constructed quickly. Mr Hepburn said the three main challenges were: Speed of the construction and what to build it out of Having a reliable electrical supply - for life-saving ventilators and equipment And being able to get medical gases to each of the beds ExCeL's existing electrical infrastructure has been modified to ensure the power supply can cope with demand - and not cut out. Temporary generators and oxygen tanks, to supply the beds, have also been installed. Mr Hepburn said his team has drawn up aninstruction manual,externalto share with other countries taking on similar emergency projects - and people in Australia and Canada have already contacted them. In pictures: NHS Nightingale Hospital London The ExCeL centre's suitability for the hospital site goes beyond the functional characteristics of the building. It is served by public transport links. The nearby London City Airport can be used to bring in supplies and equipment and there is also hotel and university accommodation close by - should it be needed. It will be led by a team of eight senior staff, drawn from local hospitals and trusts. At capacity, the hospital will need 16,000 staff to keep it running. That will include thousands of doctors, nurses and volunteers. ""The numbers are scary,"" chief operating officer Natalie Forrest said. ""To run one ward, including all of our ancillary staff, we need 200 members of staff."" The nursing staff is being drawn from other hospitals, as well as volunteers from St John Ambulance. Airline staff from Easyjet and Virgin Atlantic have also been approached. Cabin crews have security clearance and many of them are also first aid-trained. The NHS says they would be changing beds, helping doctors and nurses on the wards, and performing other non-clinical tasks. It is not a conventional walk-in hospital - only patients already on ventilators will be admitted, transferred from other intensive care units across London. They will stay at the hospital until their course of ventilation is finished. Support services such as pharmacies and therapy treatment are also be available. And a mortuary is also included in the NHS Nightingale design. Additional mortuary space is also being found elsewhere in the city, including Wanstead Flats in the Manor Park area of Newham, local residents have been told. Other temporary morgues are also being set up around the UK, including at an ice rink in Milton Keynes, a crematorium in Ruislip, and at Birmingham Airport, where the hangar facility will initially have space for 1,500 bodies ""but will expand to hold more"". Work is already underway to expand the NHS Nightingale-style hospitals beyond London to ease pressures on regional NHS services. Conference centres in Birmingham, Manchester and Harrogate have been transformed into NHS Nightingale hospitals over the past few weeks to serve the midlands and north of England. Prince William opens the new NHS Nightingale at the NEC in Birmingham Work is also underway in Glasgow and at the University of West England (UWE) in Bristol to create temporary emergency hospital sites. Scotland's emergency facility at the SEC in Glasgow will be named NHS Louisa Jordan, after a nurse who died from typhus while serving in Serbia during an outbreak in 1915. Hundreds of bed bays are being constructed in the SEC Inside Manchester's Nightingale Hospital Nightingale hospital 'example of pulling together' Look inside Glasgow's temporary NHS hospital Manchester Central convention centre has been converted into NHS Nightingale Hospital North West Belfast City Hospital's tower block has been transformed into Northern Ireland's first Nightingale hospital - a 230-bed unit staffed by a team drawn from across Northern Ireland. An extra 6,000 beds are also being set up in Wales - many in sports and leisure facilities - to take the pressure off hospitals during the coronavirus pandemic. Among them is the Principality Stadium, in Cardiff, the national stadium of Wales, with capacity for up to 2,000 beds, if needed. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms?

"Sainsburyâs has said that it will start to ease some restrictions on the quantities of items shoppers can buy. In line with other supermarkets, it has limited popular items to counter panic buying during the coronavirus pandemic. Sainsbury's will start removing limits on some products from this Sunday though restrictions on Easter eggs will be lifted immediately. Earlier in the week,Aldi, Morrisons, Waitrose and Asda all said they would be easing restrictionson some goods. Sainsbury's said restrictions would remain on items such as UHT milk, pasta and tinned tomatoes, among other goods. The supermarket's chief executive, Mike Coupe, said: âWe have been working hard with our suppliers to improve our product availability. âMost people are now just buying what they need for themselves and their families. This means we now often have stock on the shelves all day and at the end of the day.â He added: âWe have removed limits from Easter eggs immediately, as we know families often want to buy more than three and we have plenty of these in all stores and online.â A Sainsburyâs spokesperson told the BBC that restrictions would also remain in place on butter, cheese and some canned and packaged long-life items, as well as some frozen goods. Otherwise, the limits were being âlargely removedâ. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

"A revamped loan fund for ailing firms hit by the coronavirus lockdown will have an immediate impact, RBS has said. RBS chairman Sir Howard Davies admitted there had been problems but expects to see a ""sharp increase"" in lending to small firms in the next few days. On Thursday, Chancellor Rishi Sunak overhauled the scheme amid claims banks were taking advantage of the crisis. The government has pledged to guarantee Â£330bn of loans but only Â£145m has been lent so far. Small firms say they have struggled with onerous eligibility criteria for the government-backed loans, which are being issued by High Street banks and other lenders. They have also complained of facing interest rates of up to 30% and being asked to make unreasonable personal guarantees. It comes as the UK is facing recession as large parts of the economy are shut down. On Friday, the influential Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) survey showed Britain's dominant services industry suffered its biggest slump in March since 1996, sinking from a reading of 53.2 to 34.5. Any figure below 50 marks contraction. Mr Sunak said that under changes to the Coronavirus Business Interuption Loan Scheme (CBILS): Applications will not be limited to businesses that have been refused a loan on commercial terms, extending the number who benefit. However, the Treasury has not capped the interest rates banks can charge. Banks will be banned from asking company owners to guarantee loans with their own savings or property when borrowing up to Â£250,000 Larger firms with a turnover of up to Â£500m will also be eligible for more help - with state-backed loans of up to Â£25m available to firms with revenues of between Â£45m-500m. Sir Howard, who used to chair the Financial Services Authority (now known as the Financial Conduct Authority), told the BBC's Today programme that the process of checking borrowers' eligibility had been ""difficult"". He also said RBS had struggled with the demand after inquiries about the loans jumped ""by 45 times"" in a week. ""I think we have to accept that the scale of this process and the speed with which it's been put in place has caused challenges for everybody,"" he said. ""But we've had good discussions with the Treasury and small firms, and I think the changes announced overnight will make a quite a big difference."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak STRESS:How to look after your mental health On Wednesday,Business Secretary Alok Sharma said it would ""completely unacceptable""if any banks were unfairly refusing funds to good businesses in financial difficulty. He also referenced the financial crisis - when taxpayers bailed out a number of the UK's largest banks - suggesting lenders should now repay the favour. Chancellor Rishi Sunak overhauled the loan scheme for virus-hit firms However, Sir Howard told the BBC that comparing the current crisis to 2008 was ""rewriting history"". ""In the last crisis the problem was that the banks didn't have the money to lend, there was a credit crunch. ""We're not in that position at all. The banks have got the money to lend, we have a large amount of capital, we are not constrained in the volumes we can lend."" On Thursday, Mr Sunak said the government was making ""great progress"" on supporting businesses to help manage their cashflows but needed to take ""further action"" by extending the scheme. But some firms still feel they will struggle to access the loans fast enough or that they are too risky. There has been widespread concern, acknowledged by the government, that some of the emergency measures to provide financial assistance to businesses are not working. Too few firms felt able or willing to take on loans that carried an 80% government guarantee to the lender but not the borrower. The Treasury has announced new rules, meaning business owners asking to borrow less than Â£250,000 will no longer have to offer up personal guarantees. Perhaps most importantly, the requirement for companies to have first tried to get a normal commercial loan elsewhere will be dropped. However, they are still loans. Companies wishing to take them out will be 100% liable for the debt and the government has not capped the interest rate banks can charge even though banks are able to borrow at close to 0%. The loans may now be available to more businesses but what's not clear is whether firms want them. Labour welcomed the measures but accused the government of being ""behind the curve"" when implementing support measures. ""There remain huge gaps in support for employees and self-employed that must be addressed immediately if people are to avoid facing serious hardship in this crisis,"" said shadow chancellor John McDonnell. The head of the Confederation of British Industry, Carolyn Fairbairn, described the changes as a ""big step forward"" although she said more detail was needed. ""Each week brings unprecedented levels of economic support and it's encouraging to see the government stepping in where urgent help is needed."" Mike Cherry, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, told the BBC's Today programme: ""It's a very necessary and timely intervention by the chancellor, because clearly, businesses were being promised interest-free, fee-free, government support by the banks. ""Time and time again, the FSB has heard from our members and other small businesses who've approached banks seeking these emergency loans that they were being offered anything but."" Stephen Jones, the chief executive of UK Finance which represents the banks, also welcomed the changes. Speaking to the Today programme, he said: ""It was clear that those viable businesses, who were required to be offered under the terms of the scheme commercial lending under commercial terms, felt aggrieved that they were not given access to the scheme and therefore the change gives the scheme to all businesses who are capable of repaying debt after this crisis is over. ""This change is extremely welcome and it means that banks will not be forced to make very unenviable assessments in terms of who cannot or can access the scheme in terms of viable businesses out there.""

"Google is to publicly track people's movements over the course of the coronavirus pandemic. The tech firmwill publish details of the different types of places people,externalare going to on a county-by-county basis in the UK, as well as similar data for 130 other countries. The plan is to issue a regular updates with the figures referring back to activity from two or three days prior. The company has promised that individuals' privacy will be preserved. The readings are based on location data gathered via the Google Maps app or one of the firm's other mobile services. The firm typically uses this to reveal when specific museums, shops and other places are busiest as well as to revise driving routes to help motorists avoid traffic. Google will show in percentage terms how busy different types of places are compared to what they used to be earlier in the year In this case, the readings will be broken down to reveal how busy the following types of places are compared to a period earlier in the year before lockdowns were introduced: retail and recreation grocery and pharmacy parks, beaches and plazas bus, subway and train stations office buildings and other places of work residential Google said it hoped the information could be used by public health chiefs and others to help manage the outbreak.

"Healthcare services around the world have been overwhelmed by the pandemic More than a million cases of coronavirus have been registered globally, according to the latest figures from Johns Hopkins University - another grim milestone as the world grapples with the spreading pandemic. Nearly 53,000 people have died and more than 210,000 have recovered, according to theUS university's figures.,external The US has the most cases, and more than 1,000 died there in the past day. The disease, Covid-19, first emerged in central China three months ago. Though the tally kept by Johns Hopkins records one million confirmed cases, the actual number is thought to be much higher. It took a month and a half for the first 100,000 cases to be registered. A million was reached after a doubling in cases over the past week. Nearly a quarter of cases have been registered in the United States, while Europe accounts for around half. The pandemic is taking a huge economic toll: an extra 6.6 million Americans applied for unemployment benefit last week. The US has reported 1,169 deaths in 24 hours - the highest daily death toll of any country so far. Earlier, Spain said 950 people had died in a day, which is a record number for Europe in this outbreak. The number of confirmed Spanish cases rose from 102,136 on Wednesday to 110,238 - an 8% rise that is similar to the rate recorded in previous days. Authorities believe the virus is now peaking and say they expect to see a drop in figures in the days ahead. ""We continue with an increase of around 8%. This points, as we have already seen, to a stabilisation in the data that we're registering,"" said MarÃ­a JosÃ© Sierra, from the Spanish health ministry's emergency co-ordination unit. Spain, the worst-hit nation after Italy in terms of deaths, has also lost nearly 900,000 jobs since mid-March.

He was later visited by the police and accused of scaremongering.Dr Li died on 6 February after contracting the viruswhile treating patients in Wuhan. Grief and anger after the death of Dr Li Wenliang China first informed the World Health Organization (WHO) about cases of pneumonia with unknown causes,externalon 31 December. On 3 January, the BBC wrote its first news report about a ""mystery virus"" in Wuhan. At the time, 44 cases had been confirmed, 11 of which were considered severe. Many feared there would be a repeat of the 2003 Sars outbreak that killed 774 people. By 18 January the confirmed number of cases had risen to around 60 - but experts estimated the real figure was closer to 1,700. Just two days later, as millions of people prepared to travel for the lunar new year, the number of cases more than tripled to more than 200 and the virus was detected in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? US v ITALY v CHINA:How do death rates compare? LEADING THE WAY:The US governor who saw it coming early ON FRONTLINE:'Nurses prepare for the worst but not this' REASON TO HOPE:The good that may come out of this crisis On 23 January, Wuhan went into lockdown. At that point, 18 people had died and 570 others had been infected, including in Taiwan, Japan, Thailand, South Korea and the United States. Ten days later, a 44-year-old man in the Philippines died of the virus - the first death reported outside of China. A week later, an 80-year-old tourist died in France - Europe's first coronavirus death. The virus appeared in Iran five days later -  two people died within hours of their diagnosis being announced. Iran would later become a hotspot for the virus. Italy saw a major surge in cases on 23 February, and 10 towns in Lombardy went into lockdown, later extended to the whole of Italy. On 23 March, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a three-week lockdown in the UK. Three days later, on 26 March, the US officially overtook China as the country hardest-hit by the coronavirus outbreak, with more than 86,000 confirmed cases. By 2 April, this had risen to more than 217,000 - almost double the number of cases in Italy. On the same day the US hit another grim milestone. Media reports put the death toll between Wednesday and Thursday at about 1,000, the highest yet of any country in a single 24-hour period.

Culprits have been warned the Covid-19 crisis is not an âautomatic permitâ to dump their rubbish wherever they want. Newcastle City Council cabinet member Nick Kemp said: âItâs taking away valuable resources from our already stretched bin crews, who are being diverted away to clean it up while at the same time continuing to provide every resident their usual collections."" Residents have been urged not to hire anyone to take their bulky rubbish away while the tips remain shut. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics The UK death toll from coronavirusjumped by 684 in 24 hours to 3,605. This looks like further evidence that the case numbers could be slowing down (as long as every patient who needs testing is getting tested). Today's figures on deaths follow the recent trends closely (doubling roughly every 3.5 days). It takes more than three weeks from infection to death to being reported in these figures. So while we can hope to see the effects of pre-lockdown social distancing soon, it will take longer for the effect of the lockdown, announced on 23 March, to become apparent. Colourful murals thanking the NHS and key workers for their efforts have appeared on the walls of pubs in Pontefract.

"The Welsh Blood Service needs about 100,000 donations a year People are being urged to go the extra mile to give blood during the coronavirus pandemic. Travelling to donate is classed as ""essential travel"" and the Welsh Blood Service is now asking people to travel to regional hubs to donate. While stocks in Wales are currently healthy, pressure on the service means less blood is being taken. About 100,000 units of blood need to be donated to supply Wales' 19 hospitals every year. The service said since the outbreak 30% less blood had been collected - but with an equal reduction in demand from hospitals, stock remained healthy. However, the service said it was under pressure and was now reducing collections to protect staff and maintain the supply. What are the rules about giving blood? To allow people to donate close to their home or work, weekly collections had been held in 30 locations across Wales. Now donors will be asked to travel to one of five regional hubs, held in different places each week. Anyone aged between 17 and 66, who weighs over 7st 12lb (50kg) can donate, but there are height and weight restrictions for women under 20 Blood is not just used for accidents and emergencies - cancer and leukaemia patients need regular transfusions People donate roughly three quarters of a pint (about 425ml) Blood's short shelf life means stocks have to be replenished on a daily basis There are four blood groups - O positive is the most common blood group in Wales All donations are tested for HIV, hepatitis B, C and E, human T lymphotropic virus and syphilis Source: Welsh Blood Service Director Alan Prosser said: ""We are asking our amazing blood donors to go the extra mile to help our NHS at this difficult time."" ""We urge anyone who is eligible and would like to make a life-saving blood donation to visit our website to find and book an appointment at a regional donation hub near them - even if it isn't the venue they usually attend."" Under the changes, existing donors will be notified by text or phone call of any donation hub sessions taking place within a 15-mile (24km)radius of their usual donation point.

"Doorstep criminals are adapting old scams (picture posed by model) A coronavirus conman barged into the home of an 83-year-old woman claiming he was ""from health and safety"" and needed to check her property. The potential thief demanded Â£220 from the lady, who has dementia and was following guidance to stay at home amid the outbreak. He left empty-handed after she told him she only had 20p in cash with her. Trading standards officers say this is an example of how con artists are exploiting the current crisis. Years-old doorstep crimes and frauds are being revised to steal from people left alone and vulnerable by the coronavirus restrictions. Cases of kindness within communities still far outnumber doorstep crimes, but those on the front line say there is an increasing risk of exploitation. In the case of the 83-year-old woman, the cold caller repeatedly banged on the door and said she would be arrested if she did not let him in. AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash STRESS:How to look after your mental health Trading standards officers said cases of doorstep crime and other scams were rising, and urged family and neighbours to look out for the vulnerable, albeit from an appropriate distance. With only about 5% of scams reported to the authorities, they are also encouraging people to come forward if they have been targeted so cases can be investigated. Other doorstep crimes reported in recent weeks include: Fake and dangerous hand sanitisers, face masks and swabbing kits sold online and door-to-door Collections supposedly for charities helping the vulnerable, but are actually straightforward theft Gangs arriving unannounced to ""disinfect"" driveways, then charging well over the odds National Trading Standards (NTS), the frontline UK consumer protection body, said thieves were also offering to shop for housebound residents, but stealing the cash they were given. Louise Baxter, head of the NTS scams team, said: ""As people stay indoors to prevent the spread of Covid-19, criminals are preying on people in vulnerable situations who are isolated and living alone. ""There has never been a more important time for neighbours to look out for each other."" Doorstep scams 'linked to modern slavery' Warning of spike in scams linked to crisis The organisation has previously warned that members of the gangs involved in such criminality could be victims of modern slavery themselves. Some have their passports, ID and money taken by gangmasters who then put them to work, paying them poorly or not at all. Contact theCitizens Advice consumer helpline,externalto seek advice and report cases Action Fraud is thereporting service,externalfor fraud and cyber crime Online training to guard against scams is available fromFriends Against Scams,external Trading standards officers, who would normally visit victims, alongside other support charities and possibly police officers are themselves stretched and subject to social distancing guidelines. Katherine Hart, lead officer for doorstep crime at the Chartered Trading Standards Institute, said that while officers might not be able to visit in person, they could still investigate and urged people to report crimes. Without a complaint, no investigation can be started. Officers were able to issue advice remotely, and community forums were playing a vital role in issuing warnings, she said. Scam texts like this one have become more common Alongside doorstep crime, there have been widespread warnings about online, text and telephone scams which use coronavirus as a trigger to attempt to steal personal information and drain bank accounts. These range from unsolicited emails and texts claiming to be from utility providers, asking for banking and other details, to offers of refunds for cancelled holidays on fake websites. One suggests people have been fined for leaving their home during the outbreak, playing on people's fears. Many text messages impersonate the authorities and use links to fake sites, or to install malware on computers. Katy Worobec, managing director for economic crime at banking trade body, UK Finance, told BBC 5 Live Breakfast that ""it would have helped"" if the government had not put a link in its coronavirus advice text message to everybody in the UK. ""It has opened the floodgates a little for fraudsters to copy that idea,"" she said.

"The Welsh Blood Service needs about 100,000 donations a year People are being urged to go the extra mile to give blood during the coronavirus pandemic. Travelling to donate is classed as ""essential travel"" and the Welsh Blood Service is now asking people to travel to regional hubs to donate. While stocks in Wales are currently healthy, pressure on the service means less blood is being taken. About 100,000 units of blood need to be donated to supply Wales' 19 hospitals every year. The service said since the outbreak 30% less blood had been collected - but with an equal reduction in demand from hospitals, stock remained healthy. However, the service said it was under pressure and was now reducing collections to protect staff and maintain the supply. What are the rules about giving blood? To allow people to donate close to their home or work, weekly collections had been held in 30 locations across Wales. Now donors will be asked to travel to one of five regional hubs, held in different places each week. Anyone aged between 17 and 66, who weighs over 7st 12lb (50kg) can donate, but there are height and weight restrictions for women under 20 Blood is not just used for accidents and emergencies - cancer and leukaemia patients need regular transfusions People donate roughly three quarters of a pint (about 425ml) Blood's short shelf life means stocks have to be replenished on a daily basis There are four blood groups - O positive is the most common blood group in Wales All donations are tested for HIV, hepatitis B, C and E, human T lymphotropic virus and syphilis Source: Welsh Blood Service Director Alan Prosser said: ""We are asking our amazing blood donors to go the extra mile to help our NHS at this difficult time."" ""We urge anyone who is eligible and would like to make a life-saving blood donation to visit our website to find and book an appointment at a regional donation hub near them - even if it isn't the venue they usually attend."" Under the changes, existing donors will be notified by text or phone call of any donation hub sessions taking place within a 15-mile (24km)radius of their usual donation point. They will then need to make an appointment at their nearest hub. Blood donation scheme rolled out to more schools Should we pay people for donating blood?

"Healthcare services around the world have been overwhelmed by the pandemic More than a million cases of coronavirus have been registered globally, according to the latest figures from Johns Hopkins University - another grim milestone as the world grapples with the spreading pandemic. Nearly 53,000 people have died and more than 210,000 have recovered, according to theUS university's figures.,external The US has the most cases, and more than 1,000 died there in the past day. The disease, Covid-19, first emerged in central China three months ago. Though the tally kept by Johns Hopkins records one million confirmed cases, the actual number is thought to be much higher. It took a month and a half for the first 100,000 cases to be registered. A million was reached after a doubling in cases over the past week. Nearly a quarter of cases have been registered in the United States, while Europe accounts for around half. The pandemic is taking a huge economic toll: an extra 6.6 million Americans applied for unemployment benefit last week. The US has reported 1,169 deaths in 24 hours - the highest daily death toll of any country so far. Earlier, Spain said 950 people had died in a day, which is a record number for Europe in this outbreak. The number of confirmed Spanish cases rose from 102,136 on Wednesday to 110,238 - an 8% rise that is similar to the rate recorded in previous days. Authorities believe the virus is now peaking and say they expect to see a drop in figures in the days ahead. ""We continue with an increase of around 8%. This points, as we have already seen, to a stabilisation in the data that we're registering,"" said MarÃ­a JosÃ© Sierra, from the Spanish health ministry's emergency co-ordination unit. Spain, the worst-hit nation after Italy in terms of deaths, has also lost nearly 900,000 jobs since mid-March.

He was later visited by the police and accused of scaremongering.Dr Li died on 6 February after contracting the viruswhile treating patients in Wuhan. Grief and anger after the death of Dr Li Wenliang China first informed the World Health Organization (WHO) about cases of pneumonia with unknown causes,externalon 31 December. On 3 January, the BBC wrote its first news report about a ""mystery virus"" in Wuhan. At the time, 44 cases had been confirmed, 11 of which were considered severe. Many feared there would be a repeat of the 2003 Sars outbreak that killed 774 people. By 18 January the confirmed number of cases had risen to around 60 - but experts estimated the real figure was closer to 1,700. Just two days later, as millions of people prepared to travel for the lunar new year, the number of cases more than tripled to more than 200 and the virus was detected in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? US v ITALY v CHINA:How do death rates compare? LEADING THE WAY:The US governor who saw it coming early ON FRONTLINE:'Nurses prepare for the worst but not this' REASON TO HOPE:The good that may come out of this crisis On 23 January, Wuhan went into lockdown. At that point, 18 people had died and 570 others had been infected, including in Taiwan, Japan, Thailand, South Korea and the United States. Ten days later, a 44-year-old man in the Philippines died of the virus - the first death reported outside of China. A week later, an 80-year-old tourist died in France - Europe's first coronavirus death. The virus appeared in Iran five days later -  two people died within hours of their diagnosis being announced. Iran would later become a hotspot for the virus. Italy saw a major surge in cases on 23 February, and 10 towns in Lombardy went into lockdown, later extended to the whole of Italy. On 23 March, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a three-week lockdown in the UK. Three days later, on 26 March, the US officially overtook China as the country hardest-hit by the coronavirus outbreak, with more than 86,000 confirmed cases. By 2 April, this had risen to more than 217,000 - almost double the number of cases in Italy. On the same day the US hit another grim milestone. Media reports put the death toll between Wednesday and Thursday at about 1,000, the highest yet of any country in a single 24-hour period.

"Hancock's comments came after Conservative colleague Julian Knight said football was in a ""moral vacuum"" over the issue Premier League footballers should ""take a pay cut and play their part"" during the coronavirus pandemic, says health secretary Matt Hancock. Some clubs havefurloughed non-playing staffbut not looked at players' wages. ""Given the sacrifices many people are making, the first thing PL footballers can do is make a contribution,"" he said at the daily government briefing. The Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) said ""players will have to share the financial burden"". In a statement, the PFA added: ""We are aware of the public sentiment that the players should pay non-playing staff's salaries. However, our current position is that - as businesses - if clubs can afford to pay their players and staff, they should. ""The players we have spoken to recognise that the non-playing staff are a vital part of their club and they do not want to see club staff furloughed unfairly. ""Any use of the government's support schemes without genuine financial need is detrimental to the wider society. ""In instances where clubs have the resources to pay all staff, the benefit of players paying non-playing staff salaries will only serve the business of the club's shareholders."" Check out BBC Sport's five things to do today Hancock's comments came on a day when the number of UK deaths from coronavirus rose to 2,921 and followed those made by Conservative colleague Julian Knight, who is chair of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee. Knight has written to Premier League chief executive Richard Masters calling for action on player wages, saying clubs which furlough non-playing staff but do not impose cuts on player wages should be subjected to a windfall tax if they do not change approach by Tuesday, 7 April. ""The purpose of the coronavirus job retention scheme is not to support the economics of Premier League clubs,"" Knight wrote. The PFA statement added: ""We fully accept that players will have to be flexible and share the financial burden of the Covid-19 outbreak in order to secure the long-term future of their own club and indeed the wider game. ""Our advice going out to players at this point reflects that expectation."" Premier League sidesTottenham,Newcastle,BournemouthandNorwichhave opted to utilise the government's job retention scheme. Players, coaches and executive staff at Norwich have donated Â£200,000, made up of a percentage of their salaries, to help local people affected by the pandemic. Players at Championship leaders Leeds United have alreadyvolunteered to take a wage deferral, while Birmingham City players who earn more than Â£6,000 a week have beenasked to take a 50% cut for the next four months. In Europe,Barcelona and Atletico Madrid players have taken a 70% pay cut, while Juventus players and manager Maurizio Sarri have agreed tofreeze their pay for four months. Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe became the first Premier League boss to take a voluntary pay cut during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic on Wednesday. Brighton chief executive Paul Barber, technical director Dan Ashworth and head coach Graham Potter have each taken a ""significant"" voluntary pay cut but no decision has been taken on whether to furlough any of the club's staff. BBC sports editor Dan Roan Some will no doubt view politicians' criticism of highly-paid footballers as a convenient deflection tactic at a time of intensifying scrutiny on the government's handling of a national crisis. No players have so far objected to contributing some of their wealth to help their clubs at a time when their finances are in peril. But there is now a perception that the PFA has been too slow to agree action, and by failing to take the initiative have ensured a PR disaster for their members, especially after several clubs furloughed non-playing staff. The PFA needs to look after the interests of less well paid players in Leagues One and Two of course. But it has not gone unnoticed that negotiations are being led by chief executive Gordon Taylor, who promised to stand down from his Â£2m per year role more than a year ago, but remains in power. The union has been holding out for a collective wage deferral and has finally broken its silence to explain its position, with some thinly-veiled digs at some clubs in its statement. But during talks with the Premier League over the past two days it has been made very clear to the PFA that an actual pay cut is required, with clubs deprived of matchday revenue and worried that TV rights-holders will start demanding hundreds of million of pounds worth of refunds. I understand any cut would not be as high as the 70% reduction seen at clubs like Barcelona, but that now seems to be the direction of travel with an agreement anticipated on Friday. For many, however, such a gesture should already have been made.
