"Rishi Sunak has said people ""will not see austerity"" when he makes spending announcements for public services this week, despite the billions spent on the pandemic response. The government has indicated it will keep to past promises when allocating funds for policing, nurses and schools. On Wednesday the chancellor will detail theSpending Review. It will outline how taxpayers' money will be spent on departments such as health and education. But while ruling out a return to austerity,Mr Sunak has also warnedpeople will soon see an ""economic shock laid bare"". He told the BBC's Andrew Marr show that record government borrowing to deal with the coronavirus must be ""grappled with"". What is a Spending Review? How will it affect you? Where does the government borrow billions from? Sunak faces backlash over public sector pay freeze The Spending Review will give a clearer picture of the economic damage wrought by the pandemic so far. However tax rises and spending cuts were unlikely in the short term, Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), told the BBC's Today programme. ""We are still in the position of being able to borrow incredibly cheaply and really wanting to protect the economy,"" he said. Although tax rises might end up being ""quite significant"" they might not come until after the next election, Mr Johnson added. ""It's not something that is super-urgent as we come out of this crisis,"" he said. There is speculation that the chancellor wants to freeze public sector pay Last week, reports that Mr Sunak wouldfreeze wages for public sector staffwere met with fierce criticism from unions and workers, though NHS frontline staff are likely to be excluded from such a move. Speaking on Sky's Sophy Ridge On Sunday, the chancellor said: ""You will not see austerity next week, what you will see is an increase in government spending, on day-to-day public services, quite a significant one coming on the increase we had last year."" But, while he said that he ""cannot comment on future pay policy"", Mr Sunak added: ""When we think about public pay settlements, I think it would be entirely reasonable to think of those in the context of the wider economic climate."" It is thought the chancellor is keen to freeze public sector pay since average private sector earnings have fallen this year. The IFS's Mr Johnson said that while a pay freeze would save about Â£2bn a year, the chancellor would need to balance that with the need to keep money in the economy and the recruitment and retention of teachers and nurses. ""Over this year public sector pay has done much better than private sector pay... but this has come off the back of 10 years when public sector pay has done really quite badly,"" he said. On Monday, the shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, will give a speech which argues that: ""Freezing the pay of firefighters, hospital porters and teaching assistants will make them worried about making ends meet ahead of Christmas - that means they'll cut back on spending and our economy won't recover as quickly."" Labour is calling on the government to bring forward Â£30bn in capital spending over the next 18 months to create new jobs. Prior spending commitments made by the government include the hiring of 50,000 more nurses, and 20,000 extra police officers by 2023. However, the BBC's Reality Check team points out that while 30,000 new nurses will be trained locally or recruited from overseas, 20,000 of the 50,000 roles announced will be existing nurses persuaded to stay in the profession. The Reality Check team also points out that adding 20,000 police officers will return total staffing levels to the 143,000 police officers employed prior to the 2010 election when the Conservatives came to power. The government has also promised to increase spending on schools by Â£2.2bn in the 2021-2022 financial year, and direct Â£1.5bn towards building works at Further Education colleges. The Treasury announced on Sunday that another Â£1.25bn would be allocated to the prisons service. The government says a total of Â£4bn will be allocated to build more than 18,000 additional prison places across England and Wales over the next four years. Some 10,000 of these places have been planned since 2015. Mr Sunak said: ""This has been a tough year for us all. But we won't let it get in the way of delivering on our promises - the British people deserve outstanding public services, and we remain committed to delivering their priorities as we put our public services at the heart of our economic renewal.""

"Witnesses spoke about seeing a large number of officers and emergency vehicles in the city centre Six people have been taken to hospital following a large scale ""violent disturbance"" in Cardiff city centre. Police and ambulance crews were called to Queen Street at about 21:50 GMT on Saturday. One person suffered head injuries and is in a serious condition and three others are thought to have been stabbed, South Wales Police said. Four people, aged 16 and 17, have been arrested on suspicion of violent disorder. On Sunday, police said three people remained at Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales, with another at Llandough Hospital, Penarth. None of the injuries are believed to life-threatening. Police said a Taser was also used to detain one man who was obstructing officers, although he was not believed to have been involved in the disorder. Officers were alerted by ""multiple reports"" of a ""large disturbance"" on Queen Street and an investigation is under way. Det Supt Esyr Jones said: ""I'd urge any parent who suspects their child was involved in any way to come forward. ""Tackling knife crime is the responsibility of us all and any parents who have suspicions about their children being involved are not protecting them by remaining quiet."" Allow Twitter content?

""Patrols have been stepped up in the area and a dedicated team continues to investigate Saturday's incident,"" he added. Police cordons were put up around a number of streets Forensic investigations continued into the night An eyewitness said she saw one man being Tasered by police Eyewitness Elizabeth Winter said: ""Some groups of young lads seemed to be getting into altercations with the police. Then there was another man that was Tasered twice."" Cardiff student Amogh George, 24, said he saw up to 30 police officers around Queen Street and the Capitol Shopping Centre after being alerted by ""a lot of sirens"". ""People spoke about a brawl but I didn't see what was happening,"" said the journalism student. Cordons remained in place on Queen Street on Sunday morning. Part of Queen Street remained cordoned off on Sunday morning Det Supt Jones said: ""This was a violent and completely unacceptable incident which has understandably caused alarm within the local community. ""A team of 20 detectives are currently investigating the incident, trawling through vast amounts of CCTV and speaking to a number of witnesses, and I want to reassure the public that we will be relentless in identifying and arresting all those involved.""

"This video can not be played Father Christmas has some tips on how to have a safe Christmas The four UK governments have announced their plans to enable families to celebrate Christmas together. So how is the festive period likely to be different this year? The governments of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have agreeda common approachallowing up to three households to form a Christmas bubble and meet up from 23 to 27 December (22 to 28 December in Northern Ireland). People can mix in homes, places of worship and outdoor spaces, and travel restrictions will also be eased. However, a Christmas bubble must be exclusive, so people cannot swap between them. Bubble members also will not be able to visit pubs or restaurants together. There will be no limit to the number of people in a household joining a bubble in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. But the Scottish government has said that Christmas bubblesshould contain no more than eight people.Children under 12 will not count in the total. Who can I see at Christmas? Fears that a lack of skilled overseas workers on poultry farms could hit the supply of turkeys have been overcome aftertravel rules were relaxedso they could travel to the UK. But many people are buying smaller turkeys than usual because they are likely to have fewer guests. An Aberdeenshire farmer has warnedmany birds could go to waste, while a farm in Walescut its turkey numbers by 20%in September. Any turkey shortage may make some people consider a vegetarian or vegan meal instead. This year's work celebrations seem certain to take place on Zoom and other online platforms. Rules on big groups meeting up in pubs or anywhere outdoors are very unlikely to be eased in December, so seeing friends for a pre-Christmas drink or meal will probably not be allowed. Current rules for socialising outside your household/support bubble/extended household are: From 2 December inEngland, people can meetup to five other people outdoors,and in tier one areas only, up to five others indoors In most ofScotland,people cannot meet indoors, butoutdoors, depending on the area,external, up to six people (from two households) or eight (from the same area) can meet Two families can form a bubble inWalesbut cannot meet anyone else at home, andup to four from different households,externalcan meet in pubs and restaurants In Northern Ireland, two households can form a bubble butcannot meet anyone else indoors,external At the moment, it is not known what will happen about traditional Christmas religious services like midnight Mass. From 2 December inEngland,places of worshipwill reopen for communal prayer.,external Up to 50 people canattend indoor services,externalinScotlandin levels zero to three areas, but only up to 20 in level four places. Places of worship have reopened inWales,but with social distancing in place andcommunal singing banned,external. They are also open inNorthern Ireland withno limit on numbers if safety measures are in place.,externalWeddings, civil ceremonies and funerals can happen, but only 25 people. can attend While in-person shopping in non-food shops can currently happen in all of the UK except England, online retailers are expecting a big surge in demand this year. In September, shoppers were warned by an industry boss tobuy as early as possible. Andy Mulcahy, from the online businesses' industry body, told the BBC: ""At this point, I think we can expect an increase of at least 30% for the peak festive trading season, but if stores have to close this might push to 50%."" InEngland,non-essential shops will reopen on 2 December.,externalThey are currently open in all ofScotlandexcept level four areas,external, acrossWales,external, and inNorthern Ireland,external. Last posting dates,externalinside the UK range from 18 to 23 December, while we have already passed some international dates. Theatres inEnglandcan reopen on 2 December, and plans have been made for some Christmas pantomimes. While many venues and production companies havecancelled their shows, others are going ahead thanks to National Lottery backing. One is at the London Palladium, wherethe Lottery will buy seats that cannot be usedbecause of social distancing. It will also donate 20,000 free tickets to Lottery players. Meanwhile a drive-in show - the Car Park Panto - will tour Great Britain with audience memberswatching from inside their cars. Theatres inScotlandare closed inlevel two, three and four areas,external, throughoutWales,external, and to audiences inNorthern Ireland,where they can open forrehearsals or a live recording,external. The Christmas relaxation of meeting up rules does not extend to New Year's Eve, so that is likely to be a quiet affair this year, with house parties banned in most places.

"A tougher three-tiered system of local restrictions will come into force in England when the lockdown ends on 2 December, Downing Street has said. Boris Johnson is expected to set out his plan - including details of how families can see different households at Christmas - to MPs on Monday. More areas are set to be placed into the higher tiers to keep the virus under control, No 10 said. And some tiers will be strengthened to safeguard lockdown progress. Some local measures will be the same as those in the previous three-tier system, which was in place in England untilthe current lockdown began. But the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) is expected to publish research on Monday saying the previous restrictions were not strong enough. The government will identify the tiers that each area will be placed into on Thursday. What are the current rules where you live? England tiers may need strengthening - adviser Ministers want 'greater consistency' in tier system Chancellor Rishi Sunak told the BBC's Andrew Marr the 10pm closing time for pubs and restaurants was one of the things it was looking to ""refine"". It is understood rules will be relaxed to give people an extra hour to finish their food and drinks after last orders at 10pm. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality, said this would help businesses - but would be ""meaningless"" unless people were allowed to socialise with friends and family, particularly over the crucial Christmas period. Pre-lockdown, there were three tiers of restrictions -medium, high, and very high: Medium / Tier 1:Rule of six if meeting indoors or outdoors; pubs and restaurants shut at 10pm High / Tier 2:No household mixing indoors; rule of six applies outdoors; pubs and restaurants shut at 10pm Very high / Tier 3:No household mixing indoors or in some outdoor spaces; pubs and bars not serving meals are closed Newspaper reports suggest rules could be temporarily relaxed UK-wide over Christmas. Several families could be allowed to join in one ""bubble"" and mix between 22 and 28 December, according tothe Daily Telegraph,external. Ministers have made clear the festive season will be different to normal - with some restrictions expected to remain in place. BBC political correspondent Nick Eardley said conversations about Christmas between the different nations of the UK were ongoing. Sources believe a deal is probable later next week - but it is unlikely to be signed off before the prime minister's announcement on Monday. The four nations have different Covid rules but ministers are hoping to agree a joint approach for the festive period. Government ministers and advisers have been hinting about new tougher tiers over the past week. Before lockdown there was some evidence that tiers two and three were having an impact, but not tier one. Crucially, both the top two tiers involved banning mixing inside homes, so one option being discussed behind the scenes is introducing a ban across all the tiers until winter is over. The exception will, of course, be Christmas. That is a move that divides opinion. But the government sees it as a necessity, believing significant numbers of people will ignore any attempt to ban gatherings over the festive period. It is also a recognition the public needs a break from the long hard slog of the pandemic. Infection rates will of course rise, but that will be offset to some extent by a wider boost to wellbeing. Prof Calum Semple, from the University of Liverpool, said he hoped it would be possible to relax rules over Christmas if the new tiered system worked but warned ""there will be a price"", including tighter restrictions in the future. However, Prof Semple, who is a member of Sage, told Sky News's Sophy Ridge there was ""a lot to be optimistic about"". He said he expected mass vaccination of the general population to happen towards next summer, which would give ""broad immunity"" and allow a ""return back to normal"". MPs are expected to vote on the new tier system in the days before it comes into force. Many Conservative MPs are opposed to stricter measures, with 70 signing a letter coordinated by the recently-formed Covid Recovery Group (CRG), saying they cannot support a tiered approach unless they see evidence measures ""will save more lives than they cost"". Earlier this month, 32 Conservativesrebelled by voting against the current lockdownand 17 more, including former Prime Minister Theresa May, abstained. In a letter to the prime minister on Saturday, the CRG, led by former chief whip Mark Harper and ex-Brexit minister Steve Baker, warned against inflicting ""huge health and economic costs"". The letter said: ""We cannot live under such a series of damaging lockdowns and apparently arbitrary restrictions, and expect our constituents to be grateful for being let out to enjoy the festive season, only to have strict restrictions imposed on them afterwards that cause them health problems and destroy their livelihood."" Asked whether he would publish a cost-benefit analysis of any future measures, as called for by the CRG, the chancellor told Sky News it was ""very hard to be precise"" on the economic impacts of individual restrictions. THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? SOCIAL DISTANCING:Can I give my friends a hug? Labour has so far supported the need for restrictions to slow the spread of Covid-19, making a Commons defeat on the plan unlikely. But shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds told the BBC her party wanted clarity from the government over how tiers would be decided and the support available for businesses. On Saturday, the UK recorded another 19,875 new coronavirus cases and 341 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. The number of deaths was down from 511 on Friday, and 462 on Saturday 14 November.

"The UK's four nations have backed plans to allow some household mixing ""for a small number of days"" over Christmas. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is due to unveil on Monday atougher three-tiered systemfor England - to be introduced at the end of the current lockdown on 2 December. The 10pm closing time for pubs and restaurants will also be relaxed. Work to finalise the arrangements for a UK-wide approach to restrictions this Christmas is ongoing. One option that was discussed in meetings this weekend was that three households could be allowed to meet up for up to five days, according to the BBC's deputy political editor Vicki Young. Mr Johnson will detail the strengthened tiered system in a statement to the House of Commons on Monday, and every region of England will be told on Thursday which tier they will be put into after the lockdown ends. What are the current rules where you live? England tiers may need strengthening - adviser Ministers want 'greater consistency' in tier system Gyms and non-essential retail are expected to be allowed to re-open in all areas under the new plans. Last orders in pubs and restaurants will remain at 10pm, but customers will have an extra hour to drink up. The PM had also been hoping to announce arrangements for the Christmas period on Monday, but this has been delayed until at least Tuesday to allow the Scottish and Welsh cabinets to agree the plans. The Cabinet Office said ministers from England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland had endorsed a ""shared objective of facilitating some limited additional household bubbling for a small number of days"". But they have emphasised that the public will be advised to ""remain cautious"", and that ""wherever possible people should avoid travelling and minimise social contact"". Discussions are continuing - including about travel arrangements - but it is hoped agreement on the joint approach can be reached this week. The Scottish government said ""no agreement has been reached"". In respect of Northern Ireland, ministers have also ""recognised that people will want to see family and friends across the island of Ireland, and this is the subject of discussions with the Irish government"", the Cabinet Office said. Pre-lockdown, there were three tiers of restrictions -medium, high, and very high: Medium / Tier 1:Rule of six if meeting indoors or outdoors; pubs and restaurants shut at 10pm High / Tier 2:No household mixing indoors; rule of six applies outdoors; pubs and restaurants shut at 10pm Very high / Tier 3:No household mixing indoors or in some outdoor spaces; pubs and bars not serving meals are closed More areas are set to be placed into the higher tiers in England after lockdown. Some local measures will be the same as those in the previous three-tier system - which was in place in England untilthe current lockdown began- but some tiers will be strengthened, according to Downing Street. Mr Johnson met with his Cabinet to sign off on the plans on Sunday. There have been calls bya cross-party group of MPs and peers,externalfor the PM to guarantee that church services will go ahead this Christmas, as current lockdown restrictions forbid most religious services. Meanwhile, the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) is expected to publish research on Monday saying the previous tiered restrictions in England were not strong enough. But 70 Tory MPs have said they will not back the proposals without evidence. In a letter to the prime minister, the recently-formed Covid Recovery Group (CRG) said it cannot support a tiered approach unless it sees evidence measures ""will save more lives than they cost"".

"The UK's four nations have backed plans to allow some household mixing ""for a small number of days"" over Christmas. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is due to unveil on Monday atougher three-tiered systemfor England - to be introduced at the end of the current lockdown on 2 December. The 10pm closing time for pubs and restaurants will also be relaxed. Work to finalise the arrangements for a UK-wide approach to restrictions this Christmas is ongoing. One option that was discussed in meetings this weekend was that three households could be allowed to meet up for up to five days, according to the BBC's deputy political editor Vicki Young. Mr Johnson will detail the strengthened tiered system in a statement to the House of Commons on Monday, and every region of England will be told on Thursday which tier they will be put into after the lockdown ends. What are the current rules where you live? England tiers may need strengthening - adviser Ministers want 'greater consistency' in tier system Gyms and non-essential retail are expected to be allowed to re-open in all areas under the new plans. Last orders in pubs and restaurants will remain at 10pm, but customers will have an extra hour to drink up. The PM had also been hoping to announce arrangements for the Christmas period on Monday, but this has been delayed until at least Tuesday to allow the Scottish and Welsh cabinets to agree the plans. The Cabinet Office said ministers from England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland had endorsed a ""shared objective of facilitating some limited additional household bubbling for a small number of days"". But they have emphasised that the public will be advised to ""remain cautious"", and that ""wherever possible people should avoid travelling and minimise social contact"". Discussions are continuing - including about travel arrangements - but it is hoped agreement on the joint approach can be reached this week. The Scottish government said ""no agreement has been reached"". In respect of Northern Ireland, ministers have also ""recognised that people will want to see family and friends across the island of Ireland, and this is the subject of discussions with the Irish government"", the Cabinet Office said. Pre-lockdown, there were three tiers of restrictions -medium, high, and very high: Medium / Tier 1:Rule of six if meeting indoors or outdoors; pubs and restaurants shut at 10pm High / Tier 2:No household mixing indoors; rule of six applies outdoors; pubs and restaurants shut at 10pm Very high / Tier 3:No household mixing indoors or in some outdoor spaces; pubs and bars not serving meals are closed More areas are set to be placed into the higher tiers in England after lockdown. Some local measures will be the same as those in the previous three-tier system - which was in place in England untilthe current lockdown began- but some tiers will be strengthened, according to Downing Street. Mr Johnson met with his Cabinet to sign off on the plans on Sunday. There have been calls bya cross-party group of MPs and peers,externalfor the PM to guarantee that church services will go ahead this Christmas, as current lockdown restrictions forbid most religious services. Meanwhile, the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) is expected to publish research on Monday saying the previous tiered restrictions in England were not strong enough. But 70 Tory MPs have said they will not back the proposals without evidence. In a letter to the prime minister, the recently-formed Covid Recovery Group (CRG) said it cannot support a tiered approach unless it sees evidence measures ""will save more lives than they cost"". MPs are expected to vote on the new tier system in the days before it comes into force. Government ministers and advisers have been hinting about new tougher tiers over the past week. Before lockdown there was some evidence that tiers two and three were having an impact, but not tier one. Crucially, both the top two tiers involved banning mixing inside homes, so one option being discussed behind the scenes is introducing a ban across all the tiers until winter is over. The exception will, of course, be Christmas. That is a move that divides opinion. But the government sees it as a necessity, believing significant numbers of people will ignore any attempt to ban gatherings over the festive period. It is also a recognition the public needs a break from the long hard slog of the pandemic. Infection rates will of course rise, but that will be offset to some extent by a wider boost to wellbeing.

"Gyms and non-essential shops in all areas are expected to be allowed to reopen when England's lockdown ends. On Monday afternoon, Boris Johnson will explain the detail of England's return to the ""three-tier system"" when lockdown ends on 2 December. It is reported pubs in tier three will stay shut except for takeaway. In tier two, only those serving meals can open. Last orders in all pubs will remain at 22:00 GMT, but customers will have an extra hour to drink up. The ban on outdoor grassroots sportis also set to be liftedin all tiers, following calls for this restriction to be eased. And mass testing will be introduced in all tier three areas. Meanwhile, BBC Sport understandsthat outdoor sporting events in the lowest-risk areas will be allowed to admit up to 4,000 spectatorsin England from 2 December. There will be no crowds allowed at sport in the highest-risk areas. Details of which tier every region of England will be put into are expected on Thursday. Christmas get-together plan backed by UK nations Plan to end England's outdoor grassroots sport ban Spending Review will not spell austerity - Sunak What are the rules in your area? The prime minister is expected to make a statement to the House of Commons at about 15:30 GMT unveiling the plans for Covid-19 restrictions in England from 2 December. MPs will vote on these proposals later this week. More areas are set to be placed in the higher tiers - high risk or very high risk - after lockdown, No 10 has said. Gyms and non-essential shops have been closed in England since 5 November, but are expected to reopen in all areas. Gyms were previously allowed to open in tier three, despite initially being told toshut in some places. This video can not be played What will we be allowed to do at Christmas? The prime minister had hoped to announce arrangements for the Christmas period on Monday, but this has been delayed until at least Tuesday to allow the Scottish and Welsh governments to agree the plans. It comes after the Westminster government said the UK's four nations had backedplans to allow some household mixing ""for a small number of days"" over Christmas. One option that was discussed in meetings this weekend was that three households could be allowed to meet up for up to five days, according to the BBC's deputy political editor Vicki Young. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the government hoped to agree a ""cautious, balanced approach"" for Christmas ""that can allow people to see their families, but also makes sure that we can keep the virus under control"". Mr Johnson is expected to tell the House of Commons later: ""The selflessness of people in following the rules is making a difference."" The increase in new cases is ""flattening off"" in England following the introduction of the nationwide lockdown measures, he will say. The prime minister will say ""we are not out of the woods yet"", with the virus ""both far more infectious and far more deadly than seasonal flu"". ""But with expansion in testing and vaccines edging closer to deployment, the regional tiered system will help get the virus back under control and keep it there,"" he will say. Reacting to the news of the reported proposals, the Campaign for Pubs - which represents publicans across the UK - said it ""will cause hardship for thousands of families of publicans, pub staff and suppliers, as well as the loss of thousands of pubs."" Its chairman Paul Crossman, who is the licensee of three pubs in York, told BBC Radio York a relaxation of the 22:00 closing time was ""very welcome indeed"" but the news on the tiers was ""worrying"". Kate Nicholls, chief of UKHospitality, which represents businesses in the industry, said news of ""significant additional controls"" will ""cripple the UK's hospitality sector and impede economic recovery"". And Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham told the Today programme that many hospitality businesses ""will not survive"" tougher restrictions. ""It seems that a toughened tier three could be devastating for the hospitality industry and will hit cities and the city economy very, very hard indeed,"" he said. Relaxing of Covid rules 'not expected' at Hogmanay Meanwhile, dozens of Conservative MPs in the Covid recovery group (CRG) are threatening to oppose any new restrictions in a Commons vote. Group member and Tory MP Steve Baker said while they were ""reassured"" by some of the messages coming out of government, they needed to know more. ""It is still the case that where there are restrictions we still want to be sure they are going to have an impact on the transmission of Covid and we want to know that whatever is proposed they will save more lives than it will cost,"" he told Today. ""I think we will have to hear what the prime minister says before we decide how we are voting. There is of course always a danger colleagues will vote against."" The plan for extensive community testing in tier three areas follows a pilot programme in Liverpool, where more than 200,000 people were tested and which the government said contributed to the fall in cases there. Mr Johnson is expected to tell MPs that rapid testing will ""help get the virus back under control and keep it there"". Daily coronavirus testswill be offered to close contacts of peoplewho have tested positive in England, as a way to reduce the current 14-day quarantine. Downing Street also said weekly testing would be expanded to all staff working in food manufacturing, prisons and the vaccine programme from next month. On Sunday, the UK recorded another 18,662 confirmed coronavirus cases and 398 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. The total includes 141 deaths which were omitted from the 21 November figures in error. LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area TESTING:How do I get a virus test?

"This video can not be played Chancellor Rishi Sunak: ""It is right to start tackling the NHS backlog"" Chancellor Rishi Sunak is to announce an extra Â£3bn for the NHS - but has warned that people will soon see an ""economic shock laid bare"" as the country deals with the Covid pandemic. The one-year funding will be pledged in the Spending Review on Wednesday. But Mr Sunak said Covid's impact on the economy must be paid for - and high levels of borrowing could not go on indefinitely. Borrowingin October hit Â£22.3bn, with public sector debt over Â£2 trillion. The NHS usually gets extra money to tide it through the winter months but on a much more modest scale, with Â£700m in 2014/15 the highest payout of the last 10 years. The Treasury said the Â£3bn package for the NHS would help tackle backlogs in the health service, with thousands of treatments and operations delayed because of the pandemic. The number of peoplewaiting a year for treatmenthas risen from about 1,500 in February to 140,000 in September. The extra funding only applies to England but Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will receive equivalent funding. NHS chief executive Sir Simon Stevens said the extra cash would take the weight off the NHS, allowing ""one million extra checks, scans and additional operations"" to be carried out. ""And because Covid takes a mental as well as physical toll, it's particularly important that we will be able to continue to expand mental health services too,"" he said. Where will the Â£3bn go? Â£500m will supportmental health services in England Â£1bn will go towards reducing NHS backlogs, with up to one million extra checks, scans and operations paid for Â£1.5bn will be used to ease existing pressures in the health service However, the chancellor warned of hard times ahead. Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr show, he said: ""We know that three quarters of a million people have tragically already lost their jobs, with forecasts of more to come. Borrowing is at record peacetime levels already. ""It is not just numbers on a chart, it is people's lives and livelihoods, it's their security being impacted. And it is something that we are going to grapple with for a while to come, sadly."" Earlier, he toldthe Sunday Times,externalpeople would soon see ""the scale of the economic shock laid bare"" , indicating taxes might have to start rising next year and there could be spending cuts. Bailouts for the NHS during winter are not unusual, but this is, unsurprisingly, a large one by recent standards. The funding boost represents between 2 to 3% of the frontline budget. Making sure it has an immediate impact will, however, be tricky. Charities will play a crucial role in helping relieve the growing burden on mental health services from the pandemic. But the need for social distancing and infection control has reduced the amount of activity NHS hospitals can do and the health service is already purchasing a significant amount of services from the private sector. There is a particular bottleneck in waits for tests and scans. There is also a finite amount of the most precious resource - staff. The use of overtime and agency staff can help but, like the rest of the nation, significant numbers are also being asked to isolate because of exposure to the virus. It means the NHS is ruthlessly having to prioritise - and that means Covid, cancer, emergency work and children. Non-urgent treatments like knee and hip operations are the ones that are being hit the most. This money helps, but it certainly does not solve the problem. The Office for National Statistics said government borrowing last month reached the highest October figure since monthly records began in 1993 - underlining the ""substantial effect"" the pandemic is having on public finances. Government borrowing has reached Â£214.9bn - Â£169.1bn more than a year ago. The Office for Budget Responsibility has estimated it could reach Â£372.2bn by the end of the financial year in March. Paul Johnson, head of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, told the BBC the government was right to keep spending as it tried to get the crisis under control. But he said tax rises would be inevitable to stop the country's rising debt pile becoming ""unsustainable"". Mr Sunak is facing criticism following reports he might announcea pay freeze for millions of public sector workersat Wednesday's Spending Review. Frontline NHS staff would likely be excluded but those affected could include police, teachers, armed forces and civil servants. Meanwhile, the government has saidit plans to remove a longstanding biasthat has affected funding for northern England and other regions outside the South East and London. Speaking to Sky News' Sophy Ridge Programme, Mr Sunak denied the Spending Review would herald the return of austerity, saying: ""What you will see is an increase in the government's spending on day-to-day public services, quite a significant one, coming on the increase we had last year."" He declined to comment on his plans for public sector pay, but said fairness was his priority ""in the context of the wider economic climate"" . But Anneliese Dodds, Labour's shadow chancellor, told the BBC's Andrew Marr any freeze on public sector pay would stunt the recovery. ""What this measure would do is say to a firefighter, hospital porter, teaching assistants, that they will have less spending power in the future. ""That means they won't be spending in our high streets, they wont be spending in our small businesses, and that is a very good way of knocking confidence out of our economy at a time when the UK's economic downturn has been deeper than that of the rest of the G7."" A Spending Review is a chance to take a long-term view of the government's spending plans. It sets out how much money will be allocated to different government departments and how taxpayers' money will be spent. This year the governmentdecided to abandon its long-term Comprehensive Spending Reviewamid the economic uncertainty of the Covid-19 pandemic and instead next week's review will cover just one financial year. It is expected to focus on supporting jobs and public services through the Covid crisis as well as investing in infrastructure to deliver on the government's pledge to ""level up"" the country.

"Some of the UK's biggest food companies have attacked a plan that could see all online junk food advertising banned to tackle childhood obesity. In a letter to the prime minister,external, bosses of firms including Britvic, Kellogg's and Mars said they supported government efforts to tackle obesity. But they said the plans were ""disproportionate"" and lacked evidence. The government has said it is determined to help children and families make ""healthier choices"". It originally planned to ban online adverts and TV commercials for unhealthy foods that appeared before 9pm, but strengthened this in November. The prime minister is said to have changed course after being hospitalised with Covid-19, something he links to being overweight. Food giant to stop advertising ice cream to kids Coronavirus prompts PM into obesity crackdown The proposal, which is still under consultation, could usher in some of the toughest digital marketing restrictions in the world by the end of 2022. Firms would not be able to promote foods high in fat, salt or sugar in Facebook ads, paid search results on Google, text promotions and posts on platforms such as Twitter and Instagram. But the letter, which has been signed by 800 food and drink manufacturers and 3,000 UK brands, says food companies have not been given enough time to submit detailed objections. ""The UK government is quite correctly committed to evidence-based policy making. However, the evidence base underpinning these proposals is lacking in both detail and efficacy,"" it says. ""Additionally, there is still no agreed definition of which foods the government is including in these proposals. ""They are so broad they even capture family favourites from chocolate to peanut butter to sausage rolls."" Unilever, which also signed the letter, said it would stop marketing ice cream to children earlier this year The government estimates children aged under 16 were exposed to 15 billion junk food adverts online in 2019, versus 700 million two years earlier. But in the letter, firms said advertisers could use sophisticated online tools to aim their advertisements at adult audiences, not children. It also voiced concern about plans to police how producers described their products on their own websites and social media channels, saying this would disproportionately impact smaller businesses - which make up 96% of the industry. ""Is it really the government's intention that a local wedding cake business, for example, would not be able to share product details on its Instagram account in order to grow its sales?"" the letter said. The food and drink industry is the largest manufacturing sector in the UK, worth more than Â£28bn to the economy and employing almost 500,000 people. Unveiling plans for the ban earlier this month, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""I am determined to help parents, children and families in the UK make healthier choices about what they eat."" A spokesman for the Department of Health and Social Care said: ""We have committed to restricting HFSS adverts [for products high in fat, sugar and salt] on television before 9pm, but we also need to go further to address how children can be influenced online by adverts promoting unhealthy foods. ""We have launched a consultation to gather views from the public and industry stakeholders to understand the impact and challenges of introducing a total ban on the advertising of these products online.""

"A woman confronts a soldier at Whiterock in Belfast during the Troubles ""I really got my eyes opened - I was really, really scared."" When the violence of the Troubles erupted in Northern Ireland, it was press photographers like Paul Faith who were there to capture it. He and many others were effectively thrust into the role of war photographers - except the bloodshed was not half a world away, but on the streets of their own towns. These people witnessed some of the worst atrocities of the conflict. Now, seven of them have shared their experiences in a film to be broadcast on Monday night. Shooting the Darkness - which features personal testimony, archive footage and still images - reflects on how many went from working on sport or farming news to portraying images of almost unimaginable pain and suffering. Ten chapters of the NI Troubles - 1988,external Initially, Paul Faith was an onlooker to the horror of the Troubles, a 30-year period of conflict which saw 3,500 people killed and many more injured. ""The daily work would be town hall receptions, dinners, unfurling of Orange banners, parades in the town, cheque presentations - and I was just bursting to get out to do news,"" he told the documentary. ""I would go home at night, turn on the news and there were bombs going off in Belfast, people being killed. It was just mayhem elsewhere. I just needed to get out, I felt as if it was just my calling."" Soldiers running from a bomb in the Smithfield area of Belfast On one of his first assignments, he recalls shaking ""from one end of the road for three miles to the other end"" as he covered a republican parade protesting against internment, a government policy to imprison people without trial. ""You could see the vengeance and the hatred. The soldiers were scared, the republicans were vicious to them and it was just a completely different world,"" he said. He talks about republicans being very ""media savvy"" at that time. Photographer Paul Faith was thrust into a different role when violence erupted in Northern Ireland An abiding memory was the 1998 funeral of IRA man Brendan Burns, when he captured the moment Sinn FÃ©in's Martin McGuinness stood beside the coffin, alongside masked men. ""It was bandit country. The Army and police were there in force with riot shields. We weren't sure what was going to happen, but we knew if something did happen it was going to be bad,"" he said. Paul Faith captured this scene at the funeral of IRA man Brendan Burns ""As the service was ending, the coffin was going to come out, the Chinooks [helicopters] were landing, six IRA guys appeared in full camouflage gear, fully masked, berets the whole lot. ""At the coffin, McGuinness was at the front on the right-hand side, no words were spoken."" He added: ""The Provos had played their ace; they got what they wanted in this picture of Martin McGuinness beside the IRA guys, carrying the coffin."" March 1988 saw escalating violence culminating in some of the most infamous imagery to emerge from the Troubles. A fortnight of brutal violence began with the shooting dead of three IRA members in Gibraltar by the Army. Later that month, their funeral at Milltown Cemetery was attacked by loyalist Michael Stone. Three people were killed, dozens were wounded. Martin Nangle said it is better to treat what he does as a job, and not get too involved Three days later, as one of Stone's victims was being buried, the mourners were said to be fearful of another attack. On the scene was photographer Martin Nangle - who captured some of the most memorable images of that day, images that would be beamed around the world. He was there working when two plain-clothed British soldiers drove into the path of the funeral. Corporals Derek Wood and David Howes were dragged out of a car and beaten. They were later stripped and shot dead by the IRA, their bodies dumped on waste ground. Martin Nangle took a series of photographs of the scene in Andersonstown more than 30 years ago before the soldiers were killed Martin was on hand to capture what happened - but feared the footage would be confiscated as cameramen had been threatened and told to stop filming. ""It became pretty evident that if I wanted to get this story out what was in the camera had to be taken out and new film put into the camera, wound on, reeled up - so that if I was asked for the film I would open the camera and rip it out and it would look like it was being destroyed,"" he said. ""It worked insofar as the story got out and the images got out."" Martin said he always looked out for a picture that would help describe the narrative of the Troubles. ""When I saw Belfast for the first time, I was quite shocked at the degree of decaying grandeur, so to speak, that was happening all over the city. This proud Victorian city [was] basically rotting around us,"" he said. But he knew he had to document the effect violence had on the people and the social fabric of Northern Ireland. ""It's probably better to view the world when you are in a situation like that from behind a camera,"" he said. ""Your mental process is going through composition, when to make that decision to press the shutter. ""Staying behind the camera is a safety valve to separate yourself from sinking into the event and becoming part of it, which is what you don't want to do. ""It's better just to treat it as a job, as an observer and not to get too close."" It's a view echoed by Paul Faith. ""Your only saving grace was you had a camera. You had something physically in front of you. In a way, it was probably like watching a TV screen."" But he added: ""You couldn't do this job without being touched.""

"The artwork showed a girl hula-hooping with a tyre next to a bike missing its back wheel A bicycle which formed part of Banksy's hula-hooping girl artwork has gone missing. The graffiti artist's latest piece appeared on a residential street in Nottingham on 13 October. It showed a girl hula-hooping with a tyre next to a bike missing its back wheel. But the bicycle vanished from its post outside a beauty parlour in Rothesay Avenue over the weekend, which one visitor described as ""such a shame"". Resident Tracy Jayne found the artwork had been targeted when she went to visit it on Sunday morning. ""The artwork records an important part of Nottingham's history, Raleigh bikes,"" she said. ""My late husband worked for Raleigh until it closed in 2002. He died at age 48 in 2017. ""It's such a shame if someone has stolen the bike. It's sheer disrespect and saddens me very much. "" What happens when a Banksy appears? Resident Tracy Jayne found the artwork had been targeted when she went to visit it on Sunday Banksy's work drew queues of sightseers when it was claimed by the artist's Instagram feed andthe reaction was overwhelmingly positive. The council protected it with a transparent cover, but the artwork has been targeted with spray paint at least twice. Both Nottinghamshire Police and Nottingham City Council said the removal of the bike had not been reported to them. Banksy began spray-painting trains and walls in his home city of Bristol in the 1990s, and before long was leaving his artistic mark all over the world.

"The conflict is believed to have killed hundreds of people and displaced thousands more Ethiopia's prime minister has given forces in the northern region of Tigray 72 hours to surrender as government troops advance on the capital, Mekelle. Abiy Ahmed told Tigrayan leaders they were ""at a point of no return"". The Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), which controls the mountainous region, has vowed to keep fighting. The conflict has reportedly killed hundreds and displaced thousands in recent weeks. The UN has warned it could trigger a humanitarian crisis. Earlier the Ethiopian military warned Mekelle's 500,000 residents that the army would ""encircle"" the city and attack it with artillery fire. ""There will be no mercy,"" a spokesman said. Ethiopia's Tigray crisis: The long, medium, and short story Fact-checking misleading images in Ethiopia conflict TPLF leader Debretsion Gebremichael told Reuters news agency that his forces had managed to stall advancing federal troops. ""They [are] sending waves after waves but to no avail,"" he told Reuters news agency. The government said its troops took over some key towns last week. However, information is difficult to confirm and claims cannot be independently verified because phone and internet connections have been down since the beginning of the conflict. In a statement on Sunday aimed at the TPLF leadership, Mr Abiy said: ""Your journey of destruction is coming to an end, and we urge you to surrender peacefully within the next 72 hours, recognising you are at a point of no return. Take this last opportunity."" Mr Abiy said TPLF forces should ""surrender peacefully"" and that the population of Mekelle should support government forces ""in bringing this treasonous group to justice"". Debretsion Gebremichael, the man at the heart of the conflict Ethiopia's Tigray crisis: The long, medium, and short story Fact-checking misleading images in Ethiopia conflict On Friday, South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa, in his capacity as the African Union chairman, announced the appointment of three former presidents to broker talks to end the conflict. But Ethiopia has rejected the offer because it sees the operation as an internal ""law enforcement"" mission. ""We don't negotiate with criminals... We bring them to justice, not to the negotiating table,"" Mamo Mihretu, a senior aide to Mr Abiy, told the BBC. ""Our African brothers and sisters would play a more significant role if they put pressure on TPLF to surrender and for that, you know, nobody needs to go to Tigray or Mekelle to make that point clear to them."" Mr Mamo said that former leaders from Mozambique, Liberia, and South Africa - who are due to arrive in the country in the coming days - would not be able to visit Tigray because of the ongoing military operation. Communication and transport services has been severely hampered since fighting broke out. Mr Mamo said that the government was doing its ""utmost"" to allow UN agencies to provide assistance to people in Tigray. The conflict is rooted in longstanding tension between the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), the powerful regional party, and Ethiopia's central government. When Mr Abiy postponed a national election because of coronavirus in June, tensions escalated. The TPLF sees the central government as illegitimate, arguing that Mr Abiy no longer has a mandate. On 4 November the Ethiopian prime minister announced an operation against the TPLF, accusing its forces of attacking the army's northern command headquarters in Mekelle. The TPLF has rejected the claims. Its fighters, drawn mostly from a paramilitary unit and a well-drilled local militia, are thought to number 250,000. This video can not be played Three consequences of the ongoing crisis in Tigray Aid agencies have no access to the conflict zone, but they fear that thousands of civilians may have been killed since fighting erupted at the beginning of November. At least 33,000 refugees have already crossed into Sudan. The UN refugee agency has said it is preparing for up to 200,000 people to arrive over the next six months if the fighting continues. On Friday, the TPLF was accused of firing rockets into the city of Bahir Dar in the neighbouring Amhara region. The Amhara government said there were no casualties and no damage caused. But the reported incident in Amhara, which has a long-running border dispute with Tigray, has raised concerns that the conflict could extend into a wider war after regional forces were sent to support federal troops. Tigray crisis: Why there are fears of civil war in Ethiopia Marooned by conflict: 'My little brother needs medicine' Meanwhile, the UN has raised concerns about the influx of refugees into Sudan, which it says could destabilise a nation already supporting about a million people displaced from other African countries. Many of the refugees arriving in Sudan are believed to be children. Aid agencies say an immediate ceasefire would allow them to help thousands of civilians still trapped inside Ethiopia.

"Only the United States and the Soviet Union have so far retrieved lunar samples from the Moon China is to make the first attempt to retrieve rocks from the Moon since the 1970s. It is hoped the unmanned Chang'e-5 probe, to be launched on Tuesday, will bring back samples to help understand the Moon's origin and formation. The last mission of its kind, Luna 24, was by the Soviet Union in 1976. If the latest probe is successful, China will become the third country to have retrieved lunar rock, after the US and the USSR. Where were you when man first landed on the Moon? The Chang'e-5 spacecraft- named after the ancient Chinese goddess of the Moon - will be launched by a Long March 5 rocket. The probe will attempt to collect 2kg of samples from an as yet unvisited area of the Moon located in the Ocean of Storms. In comparison, the 1976 mission collected 170 grams, and the Apollo mission that put man on the Moon brought back 382kg of rocks and soil. A Long March rocket will launch the lunar probe from the Wenchang space centre in Hainan province Experts are hoping Chang'e-5 will give a better understanding of how long the Moon remained volcanically active and when its magnetic field - essential in protecting any life from the Sun's radiation - dissipated.

"Opposition parties are demanding a complete ban on discharging patients to care homes without two negative tests. The two test policy was introduced in April, but the health secretary has confirmed such discharges are still allowed. Jeane Freeman said it was ""right and proper"" that clinicians had the final say in exceptional cases. The Scottish Conservatives, Labour and the Lib Dems have called for the practice to be stopped. What went wrong in Scotland's care homes? Scottish care home deaths overtake hospital deaths Large numbers of elderly patients were moved out of hospital in the early weeks of the pandemic amid fears the NHS could soon become overwhelmed. However, ananalysis by Public Health Scotland published last monthfound no ""statistically significant evidence"" that it causedthe high rate of infection and deaths in care homes. The policy of hospital Covid patients having two negative tests prior to discharge to a care home was introduced on 21 April. The Scottish government said if they had been in hospital for any other reason, they should have one negative test before discharge. People who are admitted to care homes from the community should also have one negative test - but all new care home residents should complete 14 days of isolation, whatever the result of the test. A person would be moved without having a test in only ""exceptional"" circumstances, the government said in a statement. ""This might happen if the person has severe difficulty doing the test - for example if someone with dementia finds it highly distressing, or cannot give consent,"" it added. In a response to a parliamentary question from Labour's Monica Lennon,reported in the Sunday Mail,external, Ms Freeman confirmed patients could still be discharged to care homes without a second negative test if it was in their ""clinical interests"". ""This clinically led decision is for exceptional circumstances and after a full risk assessment, consulting the resident, family and care home on what is right for the individual and putting appropriate mitigating actions and support in place,"" she said. Pressed on the issue on the BBC's Sunday Politics, Ms Freeman said: ""It is entirely right and proper, I think, that clinicians who are experienced in elderly care and medical care and social work staff experienced in social work support for older people are the ones who will make the final decision."" Opposition MSPs are calling for the practice to be stopped immediately. Monica Lennon, Scottish Labour's health spokeswoman, said: ""People known to have Covid-19 should not be placed in care homes and Jeane Freeman must put a stop to this dangerous practice immediately before more lives are lost. ""Thousands of older and disabled people living in care homes have been forbidden from even talking to their loved one through the window, yet the Scottish government is allowing residents to bring the virus through the back door. ""Too many lives have already been sacrificed. This must end today."" Opposition parties have called for a more detailed inquiry into hospital discharges to care homes. Scottish Conservative health spokesman, Donald Cameron said: ""The SNP have clearly not learned the harsh lessons of the first wave of the pandemic, when we saw Covid-19 ripping through care homes if given even the slightest chance. ""This isn't about challenging clinical decisions, it's about the reckless message being sent from the health secretary that it could be 'entirely right and proper' to discharge patients without a test."" Scottish Lib Dem spokesman Alex Cole-Hamilton MSP said: ""What is happening is the opposite of what we were told by the government. ""There is now categoric proof that the double test protection policy is not being followed. ""The buck has to stop with ministers who have been all over the place on this. ""Care home residents and their families deserve to be treated better."" Linda Bauld, professor of Public Health at Edinburgh University, said that testing on discharge from hospital was a really important component of protecting care homes and something ""we didn't get right"" in the first wave of the pandemic. She said: ""I know it is down to clinical judgement but ideally all these patients should be tested and they should be tested twice."" Asked if there would be cases where that was not appropriate, she said: ""There would really need to be exceptional circumstances for that to be justified.""

"This video can not be played Chancellor Rishi Sunak: ""It is right to start tackling the NHS backlog"" Chancellor Rishi Sunak is to announce an extra Â£3bn for the NHS - but has warned that people will soon see an ""economic shock laid bare"" as the country deals with the Covid pandemic. The one-year funding will be pledged in the Spending Review on Wednesday. But Mr Sunak said Covid's impact on the economy must be paid for - and high levels of borrowing could not go on indefinitely. Borrowingin October hit Â£22.3bn, with public sector debt over Â£2 trillion. The NHS usually gets extra money to tide it through the winter months but on a much more modest scale, with Â£700m in 2014/15 the highest payout of the last 10 years. The Treasury said the Â£3bn package for the NHS would help tackle backlogs in the health service, with thousands of treatments and operations delayed because of the pandemic. The number of peoplewaiting a year for treatmenthas risen from about 1,500 in February to 140,000 in September. The extra funding only applies to England but Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will receive equivalent funding. NHS chief executive Sir Simon Stevens said the extra cash would take the weight off the NHS, allowing ""one million extra checks, scans and additional operations"" to be carried out. ""And because Covid takes a mental as well as physical toll, it's particularly important that we will be able to continue to expand mental health services too,"" he said. Where will the Â£3bn go? Â£500m will supportmental health services in England Â£1bn will go towards reducing NHS backlogs, with up to one million extra checks, scans and operations paid for Â£1.5bn will be used to ease existing pressures in the health service However, the chancellor warned of hard times ahead. Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr show, he said: ""We know that three quarters of a million people have tragically already lost their jobs, with forecasts of more to come. Borrowing is at record peacetime levels already. ""It is not just numbers on a chart, it is people's lives and livelihoods, it's their security being impacted. And it is something that we are going to grapple with for a while to come, sadly."" Earlier, he toldthe Sunday Times,externalpeople would soon see ""the scale of the economic shock laid bare"" , indicating taxes might have to start rising next year and there could be spending cuts. Bailouts for the NHS during winter are not unusual, but this is, unsurprisingly, a large one by recent standards. The funding boost represents between 2 to 3% of the frontline budget. Making sure it has an immediate impact will, however, be tricky. Charities will play a crucial role in helping relieve the growing burden on mental health services from the pandemic. But the need for social distancing and infection control has reduced the amount of activity NHS hospitals can do and the health service is already purchasing a significant amount of services from the private sector. There is a particular bottleneck in waits for tests and scans. There is also a finite amount of the most precious resource - staff. The use of overtime and agency staff can help but, like the rest of the nation, significant numbers are also being asked to isolate because of exposure to the virus. It means the NHS is ruthlessly having to prioritise - and that means Covid, cancer, emergency work and children. Non-urgent treatments like knee and hip operations are the ones that are being hit the most. This money helps, but it certainly does not solve the problem. The Office for National Statistics said government borrowing last month reached the highest October figure since monthly records began in 1993 - underlining the ""substantial effect"" the pandemic is having on public finances. Government borrowing has reached Â£214.9bn - Â£169.1bn more than a year ago. The Office for Budget Responsibility has estimated it could reach Â£372.2bn by the end of the financial year in March. Paul Johnson, head of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, told the BBC the government was right to keep spending as it tried to get the crisis under control. But he said tax rises would be inevitable to stop the country's rising debt pile becoming ""unsustainable"". Mr Sunak is facing criticism following reports he might announcea pay freeze for millions of public sector workersat Wednesday's Spending Review. Frontline NHS staff would likely be excluded but those affected could include police, teachers, armed forces and civil servants. Meanwhile, the government has saidit plans to remove a longstanding biasthat has affected funding for northern England and other regions outside the South East and London. Speaking to Sky News' Sophy Ridge Programme, Mr Sunak denied the Spending Review would herald the return of austerity, saying: ""What you will see is an increase in the government's spending on day-to-day public services, quite a significant one, coming on the increase we had last year."" He declined to comment on his plans for public sector pay, but said fairness was his priority ""in the context of the wider economic climate"" . But Anneliese Dodds, Labour's shadow chancellor, told the BBC's Andrew Marr any freeze on public sector pay would stunt the recovery. ""What this measure would do is say to a firefighter, hospital porter, teaching assistants, that they will have less spending power in the future. ""That means they won't be spending in our high streets, they wont be spending in our small businesses, and that is a very good way of knocking confidence out of our economy at a time when the UK's economic downturn has been deeper than that of the rest of the G7."" A Spending Review is a chance to take a long-term view of the government's spending plans. It sets out how much money will be allocated to different government departments and how taxpayers' money will be spent. This year the governmentdecided to abandon its long-term Comprehensive Spending Reviewamid the economic uncertainty of the Covid-19 pandemic and instead next week's review will cover just one financial year. It is expected to focus on supporting jobs and public services through the Covid crisis as well as investing in infrastructure to deliver on the government's pledge to ""level up"" the country.

"Pfizer has applied for emergency authorisation for its vaccine in the US The first Americans to receive a Covid-19 vaccine could get it as soon as 11 December, according to the head of the US coronavirus vaccine programme. Dr Moncef Slaoui told US network CNN the plan was to ""ship vaccines to the immunisation sites within 24 hours"" of a vaccine being approved. The comments come amid a surge in coronavirus cases across the country. The US has recorded more than 12m cases and 255,000 deaths, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. These are the highest tolls registered anywhere in the world. Will countries be left behind in the vaccine race? Is this Covid wave in the US the worst yet? A US city engulfed by Covid, but no lockdown American pharmaceutical company Pfizer and its partner BioNTechsubmitted an application on Friday for emergency authorisation in the USof their Covid-19 vaccine. The vaccine, which requires two doses, has been shown by tests to be 95% effective. Pfizer hopes to produce up to 50 million doses by the end of the year. A Food and Drug Administration (FDA) vaccine advisory committee is set to meet on 10 December to discuss whether to authorise the vaccine. Dr Slaoui told CNN it could be rolled out ""maybe on day two after approval"". The vaccine is set to be distributed based on each state's population. Dr Slaoui said individual states will be responsible for deciding who gets the vaccine first, with the recommendation that priority be given to those most at risk, like healthcare workers and the elderly. Pharmaceutical company Moderna has also reported thatits vaccine is nearly 95% effective, according to test data.The company is expected to seek approval for the vaccine in the coming weeks. Dr Slaoui said that with the level of efficacy shown in the vaccines, the US could achieve ""true herd immunity"" in May, with 70% of the population vaccinated. This video can not be played How effective is getting a Covid test before you travel for Thanksgiving? But he added: ""I really hope and look forward to seeing that the level of negative perception of the vaccine decreases and people's acceptance increases. That is going to be critical to help us. Most people need to be immunised before we can go back to a normal life."" Dr Anthony Fauci, the US's top infectious disease expert, told BBC partner CBS News that the US could reach herd immunity against Covid-19 ""reasonably quickly"" next year if enough Americans are vaccinated. Although the full trial data has yet to be published, the companies involved say there have been no serious safety concerns. It's still unclear how long protection from the vaccine lasts and if it stops people transmitting the virus. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has warned that coronavirus cases are ""rapidly rising"" across the country. The daily death toll has reached its highest level since May. Several states have imposed new mask mandates and restrictions to try to combat the rise, and in Texas the National Guard has been deployed in the city of El Paso to help with morgue operations amid a surge in coronavirus deaths. California has begun a night-time curfew, in an attempt to curb the spread of the virus. It reported a total of one million cases last week, making it the second state to do so after Texas. The new daily curfew, from 22:00 local time on Saturday (06:00 GMT Sunday) until 05:00, will carry on until 21 December, with a possible extension if needed, according to authorities. Restaurants are able to offer takeout and delivery outside these hours. Other places, including New York City, are also operating a night-time curfew. Bars, restaurants and gyms are allowed to open until 22:00, but schools have been closed. The CDC has urged Americans to avoid travelling for the Thanksgiving holiday on 26 November to prevent increased transmissions. Thanksgiving typically heralds the busiest week for travel in the US. Last year, an estimated 26 million people passed through the country's airports in the week surrounding the holiday. President Donald Trump and President-elect Joe Biden have both said they are against imposing a national lockdown, and favour letting states come up with their own rules.

"The Joanna C, registered in Brixham in Devon, sank three miles off the coast at Seaford A search for two missing fishermen whose boat sank off the Sussex coast has been called off. A major rescue effort began at Seaford, near Newhaven, on Saturday when the coastguard received an emergency alert at about 06:00 GMT. One crew member was found clinging to a buoy and taken to hospital. Despite an extensive search for two other crew members, the coastguard confirmed it had terminated efforts to find them at 15:00 GMT. The emergency signal put the 45ft scalloping vessel, which was registered in Brixham, about three nautical miles off the coast. Throughout Saturday a number of vessels, including local fishing boats, took part in the search. Eastbourne and Newhaven's RNLI lifeboats, two coastguard rescue helicopters and a fixed wing aircraft, and Birling Gap and Beachy Head Coastguard Rescue Teams were all involved, as were 12 other vessels which responded to appeals for help. Throughout Saturday a number of vessels took part in the search Chris Thomas, deputy director of HM Coastguard said its National Maritime Operations Centre co-ordinated Saturday's rescue effort ""with many units searching tirelessly since first light"". He continued: ""Sadly two other crewmen have not yet been found and all our thoughts are with their families and friends. ""It is testament to the local maritime community that HM Coastguard was so admirably supported throughout the day by nearby vessels and the local fishing communities, who joined us in force and made strenuous efforts to locate their colleagues during the search."" On Saturday, HM Coastguard controller Piers Stanbury said debris had been located close to where the alert had originated. Helen Lovell, from the Fishermen's Mission in Brixham, said the community was ""really pulling together"" and ""lighting candles and putting them in their windows"" to show they were thinking of the missing men.

"Almost one in five shops in Wales are now empty, according to the Welsh Retail Consortium. The vacancy rate increased from 15.9% to 18% in the third quarter of this year, the largest jump anywhere in the UK. However, more independent shops are opening up in town centres, business leaders have said. The Welsh Government said it provided Â£90m at the start of the year to support town centres. It added it had made a further Â£9m available to help towns recover from the coronavirus pandemic. The north-east of England, with 18.6%, was the only region in the UK to have a higher vacancy rate than Wales. Greater London had the lowest figure with 10%. Coronavirus drives shop closures to new record Home working trend could 'revive the High Street' Shopping centres and high streets have the most empty units in Wales - 20.8% and 18.6% respectively. Retail parks had the lowest, 8.6%, but this figure increased from 6.9% in the second quarter of 2020. The Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group owns Peacocks, Jaeger and Bonmarche Cardiff-basedPeacocks became the latest chain to collapse into administrationon Thursday and is one of a number to hit trouble in 2020. It comes two weeks after its owner, the Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group (EWM),put its eponymous shops into the same process. This time last year, thegroup was rescuing Bonmarche from administration, while River Island and Topshop have also closed stores in Wales. Furniture and fashion chain Laura Ashley also fell into administration in March, resulting in the closure of its factory in Newtown, Powys in June, whileDebenhams warned in April it would close four of its Welsh stores in a dispute over business rates. The south Wales valleys town of Aberdare could lose three shops on the same street - but the head of its business improvement district is optimistic for the future Some towns, such as Aberdare in Rhondda Cynon Taf, are home to multiple stores from EWM and face losing several shops at the same time if the company is not saved. Dawn Penny, manager of Our Aberdare - the town's business improvement district, said she was optimistic the town could thrive despite the threat of three shops closing. Peacocks, Bonmarche and New Look - all within a few hundred yards of each other on the town's Cardiff Street - could close. ""Everyone notices it [when shops close],"" she said. ""Obviously it's a change, but through change you can grab opportunity. ""It's not just Aberdare and it's not just Wales, and I think there's a change happening because of the pandemic... the feeling among independent business owners is really positive at the moment."" Ms Penny said some empty shops may be too large and business rates too high to be attractive to smaller businesses, but could be split into smaller units in order to fill them. ""I definitely think Aberdare has the potential to thrive,"" she added. How will arcade shops cope with social distancing? Meet the new faces hoping to make it on the High Street The positive feeling among independent business owners in Aberdare is one replicated in other parts of Wales, Pam Poynton from Bangor's business improvement district said. Ms Poynton said the city, which is home to Wales' longest high street, has seen Topshop, H&M and the Body Shop close recently, but their place has been taken by independent shops. Peacocks in Bangor had closing down signs in September, but independent businesses are filling the void She said: ""We've got a lot more people taking up smaller shops and the big ones are sort of going. It's a bit like a David and Goliath situation. ""The smaller stores seem to be outdoing the bigger stores at the moment. I think people are supporting the local shops, and I suppose now people are thinking that if they want a shop to stay open they have to support it. ""I think sometimes people are fearful of change and with Covid we don't know what's going to happen. But things people have forecasted don't seem to be happening at the moment. We've had some closures but we've got some new ones opening."" In Llandudno, Conwy county, business mentor Peter Denton said the town had ""weathered the stormy retail waters"" better than most. He said there had been a move towards coffee and tea shops on the high street, but it had ""far fewer empty shops than most towns"". He added the town's relatively isolated position on the northern coast of Wales helped it retain certain businesses, which may be an advantage in the future. Sara Jones, head of the Welsh Retail Consortium, said it was important businesses were able to stay on the high street, and a mix of chains and independent shops was crucial. Sara Jones said shopping areas must offer a mix of chains and independent stores ""We think chain closures will have a big impact, in the sense that the high street relies on being a multi-offer retail site,"" she said. ""It's a challenge because when we lose one of these it has knock-on consequences. It has a large impact on that community because a lot of those stores will be big employers. ""Having different types of business is more helpful and more attractive. It shouldn't be about attracting less big stores and bringing in more independents... if we're going to see a repurposed high street, we have to have both. ""We could still see a high street that's vibrant but it [depends on] how much now the government looks to a recovery plan that puts retail at the forefront."" The Welsh Government said it had provided funding to improve more than 50 town centres. It said: ""We announced a further Â£90m of support for town centres through our Transforming Towns approach at the start of the year. ""We have also made up to Â£9 million available to support town centres recover from the coronavirus pandemic, enabling town-centre adaptations to support current circumstances and also drive footfall in the future.""

"This video can not be played ""The campaign, which I won, by the way"": Trump falsely claims election win A judge in Pennsylvania has dismissed a lawsuit from the Trump campaign that sought to invalidate millions of mail-in votes in the battleground state. Judge Matthew Brann said the suit, which rested on allegations of irregularities, was ""without merit"". The move paves the way for Pennsylvania to next week certify Joe Biden's win - he leads by more than 80,000 votes. It is the latest blow to Donald Trump, who is trying to overturn his loss in the 3 November presidential election. He has refused to concede and made allegations of widespread electoral fraud, without providing any evidence. The lack of a concession has upended the process that normally follows a US election. Can Trump overturn the election result? Five US election fraud claims fact-checked Mr Biden is projected to defeat President Trump 306 to 232 in the US electoral college, which determines who becomes president - far above the 270 he needs to win. The Trump campaign has lost a slew of lawsuits contesting results from the election, and its latest efforts focus on stopping the swing states that handed Mr Biden his win certifying the results - an essential step for the Democrat to be formally declared victor. In the rulingJudge Brann wrote that the Trump campaign had tried to ""disenfranchise almost seven million voters"".,external He said his ""court has been presented with strained legal arguments without merit and speculative accusations"". ""In the United States of America, this cannot justify the disenfranchisement of a single voter, let alone all the voters of its sixth most populated state,"" the judge wrote. The Trump campaign argued that the state had violated the US Constitution's guarantee of equal protection under the law as some Democratic-run counties allowed voters to fix errors on their ballots while Republican-run counties did not. This video can not be played How to move on after the US election But in his ruling Judge Brann dismissed the claim, saying ""like Frankenstein's Monster"" it had been ""haphazardly stitched together"". He said even if it was the basis for a case then the Trump campaign's solution went too far. Few Republicans have called on the president to concede, but following the judge's ruling Republican Pennsylvania Senator Pat Toomey said Mr Trump had exhausted all legal options in the state and urged him to accept the result. On Sunday afternoon, the Trump legal team confirmed they were appealing against the Pennsylvania decision. Earlier his lawyerRudy Giuliani said in a statement:,external""Today's decision turns out to help us in our strategy to get expeditiously to the US Supreme Court."" There is no standard route to the Supreme Court, but challenges would usually have to be upheld in a state court first, before the issue could be escalated. Legitimate federal or constitutional question would also have to be at the heart of the complaint. Also on Saturday the Trump campaign called for another recount inGeorgia, a day after a by-hand recount confirmed Mr Biden's win in the state. The campaign said it ""has to include signature matching and other vital safeguards"". In another swing state won by Mr Biden,Michigan,Republican officials wrote to the state's electoral board to request a two-week delay in certifying the results. They called for an audit of the presidential vote in the largest county, home to Detroit, after it was contested by the Trump camp. But the Michigan Department of State said delays and audits were not permitted by law. InWisconsin, election officials accused Trump supporters of obstructing the state's recount of votes. They said observers for Mr Trump were in some cases challenging every single ballot to deliberately slow down proceedings. If the recount is not concluded by 1 December - the deadline for Wisconsin to certify its votes -  the way is open for the Trump camp to pursue a lawsuit. Mr Biden has a lead of more than 20,000 in the state. When Americans vote in a presidential election, they are actually voting in a state contest, not a national one. They are voting for state electors who will then cast one vote each for president. These electors usually follow the will of the electorate - in Michigan, for instance, they should all vote for Joe Biden because he won the state. This video can not be played Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger expressed disappointment his party lost, but said ""numbers don't lie"" The states get a varying number of votes, equivalent to the number of their representatives in the US Congress - the House and the Senate. What is the electoral college? Many world leaders have already congratulated Mr Bidenbased on his projected victory, as is customary in every US election. Russian President Vladimir Putin is one of the few holdouts. ""I want to assure you: there is no subtext here. It is not that we like or dislike someone - we are just waiting for the [US} domestic political stand-off to end,"" he told state television channel Rossiya 1 in an interview. After the 2016 US election, President Putin congratulated Mr Trump the morning after voting day. What is typically a mere formality during normal elections - the bipartisan certification of state vote totals - has become the latest battleground in the president's attempts to maintain power for the next four years. Could Trump actually be successful? It's not impossible, but the chances are very, very slim. First of all, the president would have to overturn the results in multiple states, where Biden's leads range from tens of thousands of votes to more than a hundred thousand. This isn't 2000, when everything came down just to Florida. What's more, many of the states Trump's legal team is targeting - Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania - have Democratic governors who are not going to sit idly by while all of this takes place. That doesn't mean Biden's supporters aren't worried, however. While the odds of this happening are along the lines of the earth being hit by a giant meteor or someone getting struck by lightning while winning the lottery, having victory snatched away at this point would be such a cataclysmic political event that the remote prospect of such a possibility is enough to give Democrats cold sweats.

"Witnesses spoke about seeing a large number of officers and emergency vehicles in the city centre Six people have been taken to hospital following a large scale ""violent disturbance"" in Cardiff city centre. Police and ambulance crews were called to Queen Street at about 21:50 GMT on Saturday. One person suffered head injuries and is in a serious condition and three others are thought to have been stabbed, South Wales Police said. Four people, aged 16 and 17, have been arrested on suspicion of violent disorder. On Sunday, police said three people remained at Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales, with another at Llandough Hospital, Penarth. None of the injuries are believed to life-threatening. Police said a Taser was also used to detain one man who was obstructing officers, although he was not believed to have been involved in the disorder. Officers were alerted by ""multiple reports"" of a ""large disturbance"" on Queen Street and an investigation is under way. Det Supt Esyr Jones said: ""I'd urge any parent who suspects their child was involved in any way to come forward. ""Tackling knife crime is the responsibility of us all and any parents who have suspicions about their children being involved are not protecting them by remaining quiet."" Allow Twitter content?

"The artwork showed a girl hula-hooping with a tyre next to a bike missing its back wheel A bicycle which formed part of Banksy's hula-hooping girl artwork has gone missing. The graffiti artist's latest piece appeared on a residential street in Nottingham on 13 October. It showed a girl hula-hooping with a tyre next to a bike missing its back wheel. But the bicycle vanished from its post outside a beauty parlour in Rothesay Avenue over the weekend, which one visitor described as ""such a shame"". Resident Tracy Jayne found the artwork had been targeted when she went to visit it on Sunday morning. ""The artwork records an important part of Nottingham's history, Raleigh bikes,"" she said. ""My late husband worked for Raleigh until it closed in 2002. He died at age 48 in 2017. ""It's such a shame if someone has stolen the bike. It's sheer disrespect and saddens me very much. "" What happens when a Banksy appears? Resident Tracy Jayne found the artwork had been targeted when she went to visit it on Sunday Banksy's work drew queues of sightseers when it was claimed by the artist's Instagram feed andthe reaction was overwhelmingly positive. The council protected it with a transparent cover, but the artwork has been targeted with spray paint at least twice. Both Nottinghamshire Police and Nottingham City Council said the removal of the bike had not been reported to them. Banksy began spray-painting trains and walls in his home city of Bristol in the 1990s, and before long was leaving his artistic mark all over the world.

"This video can not be played The BBC's Rebecca Morelle explains how the monoclonal antibodies work US officials have granted emergency authorisation for an experimental antibody treatment given to President Trump after his Covid-19 diagnosis. The drug, developed by Regeneron, will be allowed for use in people who have tested positive for the virus and are at risk of severe illness. Studies suggest the therapy is effective when administered early after diagnosis, the company says. It comes as Covid-19 cases in the country continue to rise. Emergency authorisation by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allows use of a treatment while studies are carried out to determine safety and effectiveness. A similar drug made by Eli Lilly, another US pharmaceutical firm, was given emergency approval earlier this month. Is this Covid wave in the US the worst yet? Tracking the global pandemic When will a coronavirus vaccine be ready? The Regeneron treatment is a combination of two monoclonal antibodies - potent, laboratory-made antibodies - which mimic our own immune response. They physically stick to the coronavirus so they cannot get inside the body's cells. Regeneron said it expected to have enough doses for about 80,000 patients by the end of this month and 300,000 in total by the end of January. The treatment will be provided for free but patients may have to pay for having it administered. The FDA said the treatment was not authorised for Covid patients who are in hospital or require oxygen. The emergency authorisation comes as the US sees a sharp rise in Covid-19 cases The drug was one of a number President Trump receivedafter testing positive for Covid-19 in October. The president later credited the experimental therapy for aiding his recovery - though it remains impossible to know whether it did. President Trump was one of only a handful of people outside clinical trials to be given the drug, under what is known as ""compassionate use"". Meanwhile, US Housing Secretary Ben Carson said he believed he was ""out of the woods"" after being ""extremely sick"" following his positive Covid diagnosis earlier this month. On Facebook, Mr Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, said Mr Trump ""cleared me for the monoclonal antibody therapy that he had previously received, which I am convinced saved my life"". As with Mr Trump, the role the drug played in his recovery is unclear. The US has now more than 12 million confirmed Covid-19 infections, with more than 255,000 deaths, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. This is by far the highest death toll in the world. The recent rise in cases has prompted many states to impose sweeping new restrictions in attempts to curb the virus, including new mask mandates.In California, a night-time curfew started on Saturdayand will be in place until 21 December, with a possible extension if needed, authorities said. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has urged Americans to avoid travelling for the Thanksgiving holiday on 26 November to prevent increased transmissions. Thanksgiving typically heralds the busiest week for travel in the US, and an estimated 26 million people passed through the country's airports in the week surrounding the holiday last year. This video can not be played How effective is getting a Covid test before you travel for Thanksgiving? A number of coronavirus vaccines are being developedaround the world, with some positive breakthroughs in recent weeks: Pfizer/BioNTech has said its vaccine stops 90% of people developing Covid symptoms; it is given in two doses, three weeks apart Moderna says its vaccine protects 94.5% of people; it is given in two doses, four weeks apart Oxford University/AstraZeneca said two weeks after a second dose, more than 99% of trial participants appeared to be protected Other trial results are also expected in the coming weeks.

"A tougher three-tiered system of local restrictions will come into force in England when the lockdown ends on 2 December, Downing Street has said. Boris Johnson is expected to set out his plan - including details of how families can see different households at Christmas - to MPs on Monday. More areas are set to be placed into the higher tiers to keep the virus under control, No 10 said. And some tiers will be strengthened to safeguard lockdown progress. Some local measures will be the same as those in the previous three-tier system, which was in place in England untilthe current lockdown began. But the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) is expected to publish research on Monday saying the previous restrictions were not strong enough. The government will identify the tiers that each area will be placed into on Thursday. What are the current rules where you live? England tiers may need strengthening - adviser Ministers want 'greater consistency' in tier system Chancellor Rishi Sunak told the BBC's Andrew Marr the 10pm closing time for pubs and restaurants was one of the things it was looking to ""refine"". It is understood rules will be relaxed to give people an extra hour to finish their food and drinks after last orders at 10pm. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality, said this would help businesses - but would be ""meaningless"" unless people were allowed to socialise with friends and family, particularly over the crucial Christmas period. Pre-lockdown, there were three tiers of restrictions -medium, high, and very high: Medium / Tier 1:Rule of six if meeting indoors or outdoors; pubs and restaurants shut at 10pm High / Tier 2:No household mixing indoors; rule of six applies outdoors; pubs and restaurants shut at 10pm Very high / Tier 3:No household mixing indoors or in some outdoor spaces; pubs and bars not serving meals are closed Newspaper reports suggest rules could be temporarily relaxed UK-wide over Christmas. Several families could be allowed to join in one ""bubble"" and mix between 22 and 28 December, according tothe Daily Telegraph,external. Ministers have made clear the festive season will be different to normal - with some restrictions expected to remain in place. BBC political correspondent Nick Eardley said conversations about Christmas between the different nations of the UK were ongoing. Sources believe a deal is probable later next week - but it is unlikely to be signed off before the prime minister's announcement on Monday. The four nations have different Covid rules but ministers are hoping to agree a joint approach for the festive period. Government ministers and advisers have been hinting about new tougher tiers over the past week. Before lockdown there was some evidence that tiers two and three were having an impact, but not tier one. Crucially, both the top two tiers involved banning mixing inside homes, so one option being discussed behind the scenes is introducing a ban across all the tiers until winter is over. The exception will, of course, be Christmas. That is a move that divides opinion. But the government sees it as a necessity, believing significant numbers of people will ignore any attempt to ban gatherings over the festive period. It is also a recognition the public needs a break from the long hard slog of the pandemic. Infection rates will of course rise, but that will be offset to some extent by a wider boost to wellbeing. Prof Calum Semple, from the University of Liverpool, said he hoped it would be possible to relax rules over Christmas if the new tiered system worked but warned ""there will be a price"", including tighter restrictions in the future. However, Prof Semple, who is a member of Sage, told Sky News's Sophy Ridge there was ""a lot to be optimistic about"". He said he expected mass vaccination of the general population to happen towards next summer, which would give ""broad immunity"" and allow a ""return back to normal"". MPs are expected to vote on the new tier system in the days before it comes into force. Many Conservative MPs are opposed to stricter measures, with 70 signing a letter coordinated by the recently-formed Covid Recovery Group (CRG), saying they cannot support a tiered approach unless they see evidence measures ""will save more lives than they cost"". Earlier this month, 32 Conservativesrebelled by voting against the current lockdownand 17 more, including former Prime Minister Theresa May, abstained. In a letter to the prime minister on Saturday, the CRG, led by former chief whip Mark Harper and ex-Brexit minister Steve Baker, warned against inflicting ""huge health and economic costs"". The letter said: ""We cannot live under such a series of damaging lockdowns and apparently arbitrary restrictions, and expect our constituents to be grateful for being let out to enjoy the festive season, only to have strict restrictions imposed on them afterwards that cause them health problems and destroy their livelihood."" Asked whether he would publish a cost-benefit analysis of any future measures, as called for by the CRG, the chancellor told Sky News it was ""very hard to be precise"" on the economic impacts of individual restrictions. THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? SOCIAL DISTANCING:Can I give my friends a hug? Labour has so far supported the need for restrictions to slow the spread of Covid-19, making a Commons defeat on the plan unlikely. But shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds told the BBC her party wanted clarity from the government over how tiers would be decided and the support available for businesses. On Saturday, the UK recorded another 19,875 new coronavirus cases and 341 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. The number of deaths was down from 511 on Friday, and 462 on Saturday 14 November.

"Opposition parties are demanding a complete ban on discharging patients to care homes without two negative tests. The two test policy was introduced in April, but the health secretary has confirmed such discharges are still allowed. Jeane Freeman said it was ""right and proper"" that clinicians had the final say in exceptional cases. The Scottish Conservatives, Labour and the Lib Dems have called for the practice to be stopped. What went wrong in Scotland's care homes? Scottish care home deaths overtake hospital deaths Large numbers of elderly patients were moved out of hospital in the early weeks of the pandemic amid fears the NHS could soon become overwhelmed. However, ananalysis by Public Health Scotland published last monthfound no ""statistically significant evidence"" that it causedthe high rate of infection and deaths in care homes. The policy of hospital Covid patients having two negative tests prior to discharge to a care home was introduced on 21 April. The Scottish government said if they had been in hospital for any other reason, they should have one negative test before discharge. People who are admitted to care homes from the community should also have one negative test - but all new care home residents should complete 14 days of isolation, whatever the result of the test. A person would be moved without having a test in only ""exceptional"" circumstances, the government said in a statement. ""This might happen if the person has severe difficulty doing the test - for example if someone with dementia finds it highly distressing, or cannot give consent,"" it added. In a response to a parliamentary question from Labour's Monica Lennon,reported in the Sunday Mail,external, Ms Freeman confirmed patients could still be discharged to care homes without a second negative test if it was in their ""clinical interests"". ""This clinically led decision is for exceptional circumstances and after a full risk assessment, consulting the resident, family and care home on what is right for the individual and putting appropriate mitigating actions and support in place,"" she said. Pressed on the issue on the BBC's Sunday Politics, Ms Freeman said: ""It is entirely right and proper, I think, that clinicians who are experienced in elderly care and medical care and social work staff experienced in social work support for older people are the ones who will make the final decision."" Opposition MSPs are calling for the practice to be stopped immediately. Monica Lennon, Scottish Labour's health spokeswoman, said: ""People known to have Covid-19 should not be placed in care homes and Jeane Freeman must put a stop to this dangerous practice immediately before more lives are lost. ""Thousands of older and disabled people living in care homes have been forbidden from even talking to their loved one through the window, yet the Scottish government is allowing residents to bring the virus through the back door. ""Too many lives have already been sacrificed. This must end today."" Opposition parties have called for a more detailed inquiry into hospital discharges to care homes. Scottish Conservative health spokesman, Donald Cameron said: ""The SNP have clearly not learned the harsh lessons of the first wave of the pandemic, when we saw Covid-19 ripping through care homes if given even the slightest chance. ""This isn't about challenging clinical decisions, it's about the reckless message being sent from the health secretary that it could be 'entirely right and proper' to discharge patients without a test."" Scottish Lib Dem spokesman Alex Cole-Hamilton MSP said: ""What is happening is the opposite of what we were told by the government. ""There is now categoric proof that the double test protection policy is not being followed. ""The buck has to stop with ministers who have been all over the place on this. ""Care home residents and their families deserve to be treated better."" Linda Bauld, professor of Public Health at Edinburgh University, said that testing on discharge from hospital was a really important component of protecting care homes and something ""we didn't get right"" in the first wave of the pandemic. She said: ""I know it is down to clinical judgement but ideally all these patients should be tested and they should be tested twice."" Asked if there would be cases where that was not appropriate, she said: ""There would really need to be exceptional circumstances for that to be justified.""

"This video can not be played ""The campaign, which I won, by the way"": Trump falsely claims election win A judge in Pennsylvania has dismissed a lawsuit from the Trump campaign that sought to invalidate millions of mail-in votes in the battleground state. Judge Matthew Brann said the suit, which rested on allegations of irregularities, was ""without merit"". The move paves the way for Pennsylvania to next week certify Joe Biden's win - he leads by more than 80,000 votes. It is the latest blow to Donald Trump, who is trying to overturn his loss in the 3 November presidential election. He has refused to concede and made allegations of widespread electoral fraud, without providing any evidence. The lack of a concession has upended the process that normally follows a US election. Can Trump overturn the election result? Five US election fraud claims fact-checked Mr Biden is projected to defeat President Trump 306 to 232 in the US electoral college, which determines who becomes president - far above the 270 he needs to win. The Trump campaign has lost a slew of lawsuits contesting results from the election, and its latest efforts focus on stopping the swing states that handed Mr Biden his win certifying the results - an essential step for the Democrat to be formally declared victor. In the rulingJudge Brann wrote that the Trump campaign had tried to ""disenfranchise almost seven million voters"".,external He said his ""court has been presented with strained legal arguments without merit and speculative accusations"". ""In the United States of America, this cannot justify the disenfranchisement of a single voter, let alone all the voters of its sixth most populated state,"" the judge wrote. The Trump campaign argued that the state had violated the US Constitution's guarantee of equal protection under the law as some Democratic-run counties allowed voters to fix errors on their ballots while Republican-run counties did not. This video can not be played How to move on after the US election But in his ruling Judge Brann dismissed the claim, saying ""like Frankenstein's Monster"" it had been ""haphazardly stitched together"". He said even if it was the basis for a case then the Trump campaign's solution went too far. Few Republicans have called on the president to concede, but following the judge's ruling Republican Pennsylvania Senator Pat Toomey said Mr Trump had exhausted all legal options in the state and urged him to accept the result. On Sunday afternoon, the Trump legal team confirmed they were appealing against the Pennsylvania decision. Earlier his lawyerRudy Giuliani said in a statement:,external""Today's decision turns out to help us in our strategy to get expeditiously to the US Supreme Court."" There is no standard route to the Supreme Court, but challenges would usually have to be upheld in a state court first, before the issue could be escalated. Legitimate federal or constitutional question would also have to be at the heart of the complaint. Also on Saturday the Trump campaign called for another recount inGeorgia, a day after a by-hand recount confirmed Mr Biden's win in the state. The campaign said it ""has to include signature matching and other vital safeguards"". In another swing state won by Mr Biden,Michigan,Republican officials wrote to the state's electoral board to request a two-week delay in certifying the results. They called for an audit of the presidential vote in the largest county, home to Detroit, after it was contested by the Trump camp. But the Michigan Department of State said delays and audits were not permitted by law. InWisconsin, election officials accused Trump supporters of obstructing the state's recount of votes. They said observers for Mr Trump were in some cases challenging every single ballot to deliberately slow down proceedings. If the recount is not concluded by 1 December - the deadline for Wisconsin to certify its votes -  the way is open for the Trump camp to pursue a lawsuit. Mr Biden has a lead of more than 20,000 in the state. When Americans vote in a presidential election, they are actually voting in a state contest, not a national one.

"This video can not be played The BBC's Rebecca Morelle explains how the monoclonal antibodies work US officials have granted emergency authorisation for an experimental antibody treatment given to President Trump after his Covid-19 diagnosis. The drug, developed by Regeneron, will be allowed for use in people who have tested positive for the virus and are at risk of severe illness. Studies suggest the therapy is effective when administered early after diagnosis, the company says. It comes as Covid-19 cases in the country continue to rise. Emergency authorisation by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allows use of a treatment while studies are carried out to determine safety and effectiveness. A similar drug made by Eli Lilly, another US pharmaceutical firm, was given emergency approval earlier this month. Is this Covid wave in the US the worst yet? Tracking the global pandemic When will a coronavirus vaccine be ready? The Regeneron treatment is a combination of two monoclonal antibodies - potent, laboratory-made antibodies - which mimic our own immune response. They physically stick to the coronavirus so they cannot get inside the body's cells. Regeneron said it expected to have enough doses for about 80,000 patients by the end of this month and 300,000 in total by the end of January. The treatment will be provided for free but patients may have to pay for having it administered. The FDA said the treatment was not authorised for Covid patients who are in hospital or require oxygen. The emergency authorisation comes as the US sees a sharp rise in Covid-19 cases The drug was one of a number President Trump receivedafter testing positive for Covid-19 in October. The president later credited the experimental therapy for aiding his recovery - though it remains impossible to know whether it did. President Trump was one of only a handful of people outside clinical trials to be given the drug, under what is known as ""compassionate use"". Meanwhile, US Housing Secretary Ben Carson said he believed he was ""out of the woods"" after being ""extremely sick"" following his positive Covid diagnosis earlier this month. On Facebook, Mr Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, said Mr Trump ""cleared me for the monoclonal antibody therapy that he had previously received, which I am convinced saved my life"". As with Mr Trump, the role the drug played in his recovery is unclear. The US has now more than 12 million confirmed Covid-19 infections, with more than 255,000 deaths, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. This is by far the highest death toll in the world. The recent rise in cases has prompted many states to impose sweeping new restrictions in attempts to curb the virus, including new mask mandates.In California, a night-time curfew started on Saturdayand will be in place until 21 December, with a possible extension if needed, authorities said. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has urged Americans to avoid travelling for the Thanksgiving holiday on 26 November to prevent increased transmissions.

"This video can not be played ""The campaign, which I won, by the way"": Trump falsely claims election win A judge in Pennsylvania has dismissed a lawsuit from the Trump campaign that sought to invalidate millions of mail-in votes in the battleground state. Judge Matthew Brann said the suit, which rested on allegations of irregularities, was ""without merit"". The move paves the way for Pennsylvania to next week certify Joe Biden's win - he leads by more than 80,000 votes. It is the latest blow to Donald Trump, who is trying to overturn his loss in the 3 November presidential election. He has refused to concede and made allegations of widespread electoral fraud, without providing any evidence. The lack of a concession has upended the process that normally follows a US election. Can Trump overturn the election result? Five US election fraud claims fact-checked Mr Biden is projected to defeat President Trump 306 to 232 in the US electoral college, which determines who becomes president - far above the 270 he needs to win. The Trump campaign has lost a slew of lawsuits contesting results from the election, and its latest efforts focus on stopping the swing states that handed Mr Biden his win certifying the results - an essential step for the Democrat to be formally declared victor. In the rulingJudge Brann wrote that the Trump campaign had tried to ""disenfranchise almost seven million voters"".,external He said his ""court has been presented with strained legal arguments without merit and speculative accusations"". ""In the United States of America, this cannot justify the disenfranchisement of a single voter, let alone all the voters of its sixth most populated state,"" the judge wrote. The Trump campaign argued that the state had violated the US Constitution's guarantee of equal protection under the law as some Democratic-run counties allowed voters to fix errors on their ballots while Republican-run counties did not. This video can not be played How to move on after the US election But in his ruling Judge Brann dismissed the claim, saying ""like Frankenstein's Monster"" it had been ""haphazardly stitched together"". He said even if it was the basis for a case then the Trump campaign's solution went too far. Few Republicans have called on the president to concede, but following the judge's ruling Republican Pennsylvania Senator Pat Toomey said Mr Trump had exhausted all legal options in the state and urged him to accept the result. On Sunday afternoon, the Trump legal team confirmed they were appealing against the Pennsylvania decision. Earlier his lawyerRudy Giuliani said in a statement:,external""Today's decision turns out to help us in our strategy to get expeditiously to the US Supreme Court."" There is no standard route to the Supreme Court, but challenges would usually have to be upheld in a state court first, before the issue could be escalated. Legitimate federal or constitutional question would also have to be at the heart of the complaint. Also on Saturday the Trump campaign called for another recount inGeorgia, a day after a by-hand recount confirmed Mr Biden's win in the state. The campaign said it ""has to include signature matching and other vital safeguards"". In another swing state won by Mr Biden,Michigan,Republican officials wrote to the state's electoral board to request a two-week delay in certifying the results. They called for an audit of the presidential vote in the largest county, home to Detroit, after it was contested by the Trump camp. But the Michigan Department of State said delays and audits were not permitted by law. InWisconsin, election officials accused Trump supporters of obstructing the state's recount of votes. They said observers for Mr Trump were in some cases challenging every single ballot to deliberately slow down proceedings. If the recount is not concluded by 1 December - the deadline for Wisconsin to certify its votes -  the way is open for the Trump camp to pursue a lawsuit. Mr Biden has a lead of more than 20,000 in the state. When Americans vote in a presidential election, they are actually voting in a state contest, not a national one. They are voting for state electors who will then cast one vote each for president. These electors usually follow the will of the electorate - in Michigan, for instance, they should all vote for Joe Biden because he won the state.

"The Joanna C, registered in Brixham in Devon, sank three miles off the coast at Seaford A search for two missing fishermen whose boat sank off the Sussex coast has been called off. A major rescue effort began at Seaford, near Newhaven, on Saturday when the coastguard received an emergency alert at about 06:00 GMT. One crew member was found clinging to a buoy and taken to hospital. Despite an extensive search for two other crew members, the coastguard confirmed it had terminated efforts to find them at 15:00 GMT. The emergency signal put the 45ft scalloping vessel, which was registered in Brixham, about three nautical miles off the coast. Throughout Saturday a number of vessels, including local fishing boats, took part in the search. Eastbourne and Newhaven's RNLI lifeboats, two coastguard rescue helicopters and a fixed wing aircraft, and Birling Gap and Beachy Head Coastguard Rescue Teams were all involved, as were 12 other vessels which responded to appeals for help. Throughout Saturday a number of vessels took part in the search Chris Thomas, deputy director of HM Coastguard said its National Maritime Operations Centre co-ordinated Saturday's rescue effort ""with many units searching tirelessly since first light"". He continued: ""Sadly two other crewmen have not yet been found and all our thoughts are with their families and friends. ""It is testament to the local maritime community that HM Coastguard was so admirably supported throughout the day by nearby vessels and the local fishing communities, who joined us in force and made strenuous efforts to locate their colleagues during the search."" On Saturday, HM Coastguard controller Piers Stanbury said debris had been located close to where the alert had originated. Helen Lovell, from the Fishermen's Mission in Brixham, said the community was ""really pulling together"" and ""lighting candles and putting them in their windows"" to show they were thinking of the missing men.

"Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby has warned Boris Johnson against cutting the UK's overseas aid budget. The government wants to reduce the annual spendfrom 0.7% of national income to 0.5%. But Mr Welby said ""helping the world's poorest is one of the great moral and ethical achievements of our country"". The archbishop, who will take a three-month sabbatical in May next year, said any recovery from the pandemic required ""a global response"". ""In his teaching, Jesus Christ tells us we mustn't limit our concept of neighbour simply to those close by to us. We need to heed that message in the tough times, as well as the good. ""Keeping our aid commitment is a strong signal that the UK is a reliable partner for long-term economic, social, environmental and educational advancement across the globe,"" the archbishop said. UK aid is distributed with the aim of protecting public health and alleviating global poverty Reports earlier this week that the government was considering cutting Â£4bn from the overseas aid budget have met strong resistance. In recent days, 185 charities, two former prime ministers, opposition parties and senior Tories have all urged the government to think again. Microsoft founder Bill Gates is the latest public figure to call on the British government to protect the foreign aid budget at next week's spending review. ""It's never made less sense to cut foreign aid than right now,"" said the billionaire philanthropist. ""Covid-19 has reminded us viruses don't respect border laws; they don't check your passport before entering your lungs. The only way the UK - or any country - will be free of this virus is if every country is. ""This is a moment when what's good for the world - and what's good for the UK - are exactly the same thing."" Cameron and Blair warn against aid budget cut Austerity after virus catastrophic, says Welby UK's foreign aid spending cut by Â£2.9bn Spending on foreign aid is linked to the UK's national income - its GDP - which has been badly impacted by the pandemic. The government has already announced a Â£2.9bn cut from the budget for the rest of 2020 in order to avoid over-shooting the 0.7% target. The 0.7% target, initially proposed by the United Nations in the 1970s, was first adopted in the UK by Tony Blair's Labour government in 2005. However, it was not actually reached until 2013 - under the coalition government, led by David Cameron. Both Mr Blair and Mr Cameron have criticised any suggestion of a spending reduction, with Mr Cameron calling it a ""moral, strategic and political mistake"". But, with UK's national debt now over Â£2 trillion, some Conservatives have argued money should be re-directed to domestic priorities. Mr Welby said Britain's ""generosity"" gave the UK ""massive influence for good globally"". It comes as Lambeth Palace, the London home of the archbishop, announced Mr Welby would take three months of planned leave next year, studying in either Cambridge or the United States. He will use his time off for ""reflection, prayer, and spiritual renewal"", but will remain in regular contact with his staff while away, the palace added. Mr Welby's sabbatical was due to begin following the Lambeth Conference this year, but it was postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic. He is expected to resume his official duties in September 2021.

They had a nice flat in the picturesque cathedral city of Durham, multiple degrees from universities including Oxford and Cambridge, flourishing careers and were three weeks away from getting married. But beneath the surface, both felt hollow inside, like ""zombies sleepwalking through life"", Esther recalls. Dan, a business development manager, was getting counselling for depression while Esther, who ran her own personal training firm, battled with chronic fatigue sparked by her own mental health struggles. And then Dan nearly died. Dan and Esther had always been keen travellers Doctors had told Esther to say her final goodbye to her partner of 11 years just in case they were unable to halt the ""flesh-eating"" bacteria threatening to devour his insides; the necrotising fasciitis he had was an infection that followed surgery to ease a bowel incontinence-causing defect he had endured since birth. They could not have known it on that fretful night, but the moment Dan nearly died proved to be the moment his and Esther's life together really started. ""It was the kick up the backside we needed,"" says Dan, chatting six years later via video-call from an idyllic vineyard in Gascony, France, where he is house-sitting. In the on-screen box beside Dan, Esther, who is broadcasting live from the pair's parked-up campervan, nods. ""People say every cloud has a silver lining but when you're in the cloud it does not look like it,"" she says. It's not always easy to see the silver lining when you are in the clouds, Esther says The couple are currently several hundred miles apart, Dan opting to stay still for a time while Esther prefers to keep mobile. ""We've got the best of both worlds, really,"" Esther says. ""We get a home bug and a travel bug. Travelling takes you to some beautiful places but it feels a bit unsettled at times, so then we house-sit somewhere to get a bit of stability. ""We realised that during the coronavirus we had not been apart from each other for a year so decided to each just do our own thing for a bit. This whole thing has been really good for us individually and our relationship; we are genuinely happy now."" Dan and Esther say they have found true happiness on the road The seeds of that happiness first started to be sown in the weeks after Dan's operation, when he was lying on the sofa eating chunks of discounted Christmas cake they had bought for their wedding. The nuptials had to be cancelled because of his health scare, and they've still not got around to becoming husband and wife. ""We really loved to travel and we kept saying one day we would do it, but there was always another project, another job to help pay for the future we wanted that we should do first,"" Esther says. ""We were always just chasing the next objective, always chasing something bigger so we could do something in the future. Then all of a sudden someone turns around and says the person I love and was planning to do it all with could be gone by the morning. ""It was time for us to think again about our lives."" There was a world out there that they were missing Dan nods, adding simply: ""We were taking our future for granted."" With Dan recovering, they decided to start travelling almost immediately, and within three weeks they were on the road. They found a campervan - quickly nicknamed Homer - a tenant for their flat and a buyer for their car. Dan and Esther posed for one final picture in Durham before leaving in 2014 Initially they put most of their possessions in a friend's attic, but have since given most away to friends and charities. ""Everything we own and consider personal possessions fits in the van,"" Dan says. They reckoned with their savings and rental income from their Durham home they could head off for a year-long adventure. The two fitness fanatics were keen to hike and cycle in some of Europe's most beautiful spots. One year has become six and counting, with the couple living off a combination of savings, rental income and money earned doing odd jobs. The two fitness fanatics have biked and hiked their way through Europe ""When you are sitting on your sofa in Durham trying to decide if you can take the financial risk, with people asking you 'what about your pension?' or 'what about this or that?', you are pretty risk averse,"" Esther says. ""It was not until on the road and finding out how inexpensive it could be, and interacting with people living on the road for 10 or 20 years, that we started to see we did not have to go back to the careers that we had. ""We could have done this years earlier."" When not moving around, they have found work on farms and house-sitting They have never really had a plan but instead have just been ""searching for a feeling"", Dan says. They've lived in France, Switzerland, Austria, Italy, Slovenia and Liechtenstein, enjoying summers in the altitudes of the Alps and Pyrenees, and have spent winters in the warmer climes of Spain. They have biked and hiked thousands of miles, sometimes apart but most of it together; both recognise they were in a fortunate financial position that's certainly not shared by everyone. They spend their summers in the mountains No matter how hard they had worked to put themselves in that situation, there was still an element of luck to get there. And they say luck has accompanied them throughout. ""The overriding experience for me is that something always comes up,"" Dan says. ""Every time we said 'we needed to do this or that', something happened that made that possible."" They say their only possessions are those that can fit in their campervan There was the time they broke down in Italy on a national holiday with the garages closed, and a chance encounter with an expat Mancunian walking her dog led to them being offered a place to stay. Or when they quickly found farm work or house-sitting jobs when they needed some extra cash or a stable base for a while. And then there was the arrival of Leela. Dan and Esther were staying in San JosÃ© in Almeria when they made a new friend, a street dog called Leela In January 2017, Dan and Esther found themselves in San JosÃ©, a small fishing village of pristine white houses beside the dazzling blue Alboran Sea in southern Spain, enjoying lunch at a cafe with Esther's parents, who had flown out to see how the pair were getting on. It was the cheese and ham toastie that caught Leela's attention. The eight-month-old was a stray, a not uncommon sight in Spain. Esther and Dan met Leela in a cafe in Spain This one day found Leela on the cafe's terrace, where Esther and Dan slipped her the remnants of their lunch. After some deliberation, Dan and Esther decided to give Leela a home - but what they didn't know until they took her to the vet to be checked over was that their new friend was pregnant. They soon rented a house in the town, where Leela could give birth to her six puppies, and helped the inexperienced mother raise them: Dan and Esther bottle-fed the pups every three hours for several weeks. Two of the dogs found new homes in Spain, while the other four and their mother joined Dan and Esther on their travels. This was the inspiration for what became a series of children's books written by the couple, to add to several travel books Dan has authored. Leela and her pups have joined in with the travelling One campervan, two people and five dogs, and there are no plans to end the adventure, no matter how much they miss friends, family and the weekend trips they used to take to the beaches of Northumberland and hills of the Lake District. They might currently be in separate countries but they are of one mind when asked what they plan to do next. ""We haven't got a clue,"" Dan smiles, and Esther nods enthusiastically.

"Newspaper reports suggest rules could be temporarily relaxed UK-wide over Christmas It is still the Welsh Government's aim to reach a UK-wide agreement on Covid-19 rules for the Christmas period, the health minister has said. Vaughan Gething's comments come after Downing Street saidBoris Johnson was expected to make an announcement on Christmasto MPs on Monday. Mr Gething said he was ""not sure"" the prime minister would ""announce their plans for Christmas tomorrow"". He said all four UK governments were due to continue talks later this week. Mr Gething did not put a timetable on when an announcement could be made, saying the Welsh Government would ""like to do it as soon as possible"". The UK Cabinet Office said ministers from the four nations agreed on the importance of allowing families and friends to meet ""in a careful and limited way, while recognising that this will not be a normal festive period and the risks of transmission remain very real"". A statement also said ministers endorsed ""a shared objective of facilitating some limited additional household bubbling for a small number of days"". Speaking toBBC Politics Wales, Mr Gething said Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford ""had another constructive conversation"" with UK Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove and other first ministers on Saturday. Asked if an announcement could be made this week, he said: ""We have a cabinet coming up this week. We'll want to consider the conversations and how far they've got over the weekend. ""We'll also want to consider the advice of our chief medical officer about the potential proposals for Christmas and to understand what that might mean in terms of the future health of the population but also the capacity of our National Health Service to help treat people and to keep them alive."" Christmas restriction warning if Wales' cases rise Students going home should travel by 9 December Newspaper reports suggest rules could be temporarily relaxed UK-wide over Christmas, with several families allowed to join one ""bubble"" and mix between 22 and 28 December, according to theDaily Telegraph,external. Vaughan Gething said the conversation about Christmas ""isn't complete"" Mr Gething said ministers were ""looking at a timeframe that would allow people to travel"" but would not be drawn on any detail. He said he wanted a four nations approach ""as far as possible to make it easier for people to understand what they can do, to help people to do the right thing"". How many Covid deaths have there been in Wales? Paul Davies, leader of the Conservatives in the Senedd, said: ""It's good news for everyone that all four governments are currently committed to a four nation approach to Christmas and the festive season. ""Along with any potential vaccine, it is essential that the four governments work together to get us out of the pandemic united and together. ""People have family members and loved ones in all corners of the UK so having a joined up approach that allows people to get together no matter where they may live is vital,"" he added. Plaid Cymru health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth has called for the government to think ""compassionately"" about which rules are in place between November and the new year, so people may have ""at least one long bank holiday weekend with family"". ""It can't be a normal Christmas, but I'd hope that everything possible is done to allow us to spend time safely with loved ones,"" he said. Mr ap Iorwerth also called for a mass testing programme for areas of high transmission -such as the one in Merthyr Tydfil- and a ""comprehensive vaccine plan"" to be published. On Friday, Mr Drakeford warned that if Covid cases rise, thenpeople will not have extra Christmas freedoms. Following encouraging news aboutcoronavirus vaccines, with some successful trials reported, Mr Gething said it was ""possible"" the vaccination process could start before Christmas. But, he added: ""That still depends on whether the first vaccine, the Pfizer candidate, goes through all its regulatory and safety checks. ""If it is available before Christmas, we have a plan to be able to start vaccinating people this calendar year. ""To get population coverage, that depends on other vaccines becoming available, and we're not in control of that either. ""I wouldn't want to give a timeframe within which we'll have population coverage."" With Welsh Governmentofficials considering mass testing all pupils and students, Mr Gething said he hoped to announce ""over the next week or so"" which sectors would be prioritised for rapid tests.

"Council and military personnel are helping with the testing Merthyr council said 977 people were tested for coronavirus during Wales's first day of mass-testing. However only nine people tested on Saturday were found to have Covid-19. Up to 175 armed forces personnel were drafted in to help as people queued at Merthyr Tydfil Leisure Centre. It comes weeks after the area was given the title of the worst affected place in the UK. Latest figures showed it had 250.3 cases per 100,000 of the population over a seven-day period. This places it behind Blaenau Gwent (396.5) and Neath Port Talbot (258.9). Hundreds queued around the leisure centre to get tested Anyone living or working in the county can now get a test and up to 60,000 people could be tested in total, with those without symptoms also urged to take a test. Merthyr council has revealedthe full list of testing sites and their opening times,external. It has also created a regional helpline for those who test positive or were contacted by tracers and told to self-isolate.

"""For me it's quite confusing as I want to prepare and I haven't been given the information in order to feel confident with the next steps I need to take."" Fifteen-year-old Lucia Kingman is one of more than 2,500 young people in Wales who are home-schooled. Unlike GCSE students in schools,who will not be sitting exams next year, Lucia is still waiting to find out. The Welsh Government said an advisory group was considering arrangements for private candidates. Lucia, who lives in Vale of Glamorgan, said studying throughout the pandemic was not dissimilar to her usual routine, but it did have an effect, such as when the library had to close. ""Because a lot of the work I do is teacher assessments, exams are quite alienating to me to a certain degree,"" she said. ""I need to do some exam practice so I can get familiar with them but the not knowing if I am to sit them or not is very daunting, and adding to an already stressful time."" Q&A: What does Wales scrapping 2021 exams mean? Fears for teachers' workload after exams cancelled Lucia is used to being assessed by her tutors, the unfamiliar territory is exams. Her father, Simon, said: ""If it's about fairness and clarity then she should be getting teacher assessments like all her peers in Wales. ""She is comfortable with being assessed, she sat her history GCSE early last year and was given a teacher assessment grade, so why can this not be the case for her GCSEs this year?"" School pupils know what to expect for next year in Wales Lucy Mebarki, a private English and arts tutor, feels tutors have a much better one-to-one relationship with students than in a classroom environment, but thinks exams would be fairer for home-based students. ""With home-schooled students not being subject to the same classroom-based observations as those in schools I think exams would be the right way for them to get their grades,"" she said. What makes the situation difficult for Lucia is that she is a Welsh student who is being assessed by Oxford Home Schooling, an awarding body based in England. Simon said: ""She's an anomaly, but I am sure she isn't the only home-schooled young person in this situation. Welsh Government really need to think about all students in Wales, not just those in schools."" Oxford Home Schooling said it received guidance from exam boards rather than government and its courses will have examination centres in Wales. It said if boards decided exams could not be sat, then it would come to a calculated grade. A Welsh Government spokesman said: ""Our priority is to support all learners in developing the skills and knowledge they need to confidently progress to the next stage of their education, training or career. ""An independent advisory group has been established to develop proposals for next year's assessments. Arrangements for private candidates will be one of the key aspects considered by the group."" Exams in England delayed but still going ahead in 2021 Pupils allowed to wear face coverings during exams Ofqual, which regulates exams and qualifications in England, said the UK government had ""made it clear thatexams will take place in 2021and this certainty should be particularly welcomed by students who are home educated"". ""We are providing advice to the Department for Education on contingency options for 2021 for a range of different scenarios, and continuing to have discussions with school and college representatives, including representatives of private candidates,"" it added. This video can not be played Some pupils are happy with the news but others less so Qualifications Wales saidthe Welsh education minister's announcementcovered the WJEC GCSE, AS and A-level qualifications in Wales, ""not qualifications from any other exam board"". ""We are conscious that whatever approach to assessment of WJEC GCSEs, AS and A-levels is decided on for summer 2021, it needs to allow fair access to assessment. ""That's so that all learners, including those who are not studying at a school or college, or other exam centre, can still be assessed and awarded these qualifications, in the same way that other learners will.""

"Some of the UK's biggest food companies have attacked a plan that could see all online junk food advertising banned to tackle childhood obesity. In a letter to the prime minister,external, bosses of firms including Britvic, Kellogg's and Mars said they supported government efforts to tackle obesity. But they said the plans were ""disproportionate"" and lacked evidence. The government has said it is determined to help children and families make ""healthier choices"". It originally planned to ban online adverts and TV commercials for unhealthy foods that appeared before 9pm, but strengthened this in November. The prime minister is said to have changed course after being hospitalised with Covid-19, something he links to being overweight. Food giant to stop advertising ice cream to kids Coronavirus prompts PM into obesity crackdown The proposal, which is still under consultation, could usher in some of the toughest digital marketing restrictions in the world by the end of 2022. Firms would not be able to promote foods high in fat, salt or sugar in Facebook ads, paid search results on Google, text promotions and posts on platforms such as Twitter and Instagram. But the letter, which has been signed by 800 food and drink manufacturers and 3,000 UK brands, says food companies have not been given enough time to submit detailed objections. ""The UK government is quite correctly committed to evidence-based policy making. However, the evidence base underpinning these proposals is lacking in both detail and efficacy,"" it says. ""Additionally, there is still no agreed definition of which foods the government is including in these proposals. ""They are so broad they even capture family favourites from chocolate to peanut butter to sausage rolls."" Unilever, which also signed the letter, said it would stop marketing ice cream to children earlier this year The government estimates children aged under 16 were exposed to 15 billion junk food adverts online in 2019, versus 700 million two years earlier. But in the letter, firms said advertisers could use sophisticated online tools to aim their advertisements at adult audiences, not children. It also voiced concern about plans to police how producers described their products on their own websites and social media channels, saying this would disproportionately impact smaller businesses - which make up 96% of the industry. ""Is it really the government's intention that a local wedding cake business, for example, would not be able to share product details on its Instagram account in order to grow its sales?"" the letter said. The food and drink industry is the largest manufacturing sector in the UK, worth more than Â£28bn to the economy and employing almost 500,000 people. Unveiling plans for the ban earlier this month, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""I am determined to help parents, children and families in the UK make healthier choices about what they eat."" A spokesman for the Department of Health and Social Care said: ""We have committed to restricting HFSS adverts [for products high in fat, sugar and salt] on television before 9pm, but we also need to go further to address how children can be influenced online by adverts promoting unhealthy foods. ""We have launched a consultation to gather views from the public and industry stakeholders to understand the impact and challenges of introducing a total ban on the advertising of these products online.""

"If you are told to self-isolate by the NHS Covid app, you do not qualify for a Â£500 support grant The government has been urged to expand eligibility for self-isolation support grants in England. Currently, people asked to stay at home by the NHS Covid app do not qualify for the Â£500 grant given to those on low incomes who are told to self-isolate by NHS Test and Trace. Parents who have to stay at home to look after children who are self-isolating are also excluded. Citizens Advice said it meant people faced an ""impossible choice"". People faced having to take a ""big hit"" to their income and might end up struggling with bills in order to help stop the spread of the virus, the charity said. The government said it was exploring how to expand the system to cover those advised to isolate by the app. And speaking to the BBC, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the government was also looking at ways of reducing the isolation period. NHS Covid-19 app to issue more self-isolate alerts Why payday is different during the crisis Why did test-and-trace app contact its boss? The support scheme is designed to help people who cannot work from home and lose income because they are self-isolating. If you test positive, you are provided with a code, which you can use to apply for the grant. But a number of loopholes have emerged - which charities say need to be addressed. As well as parents looking after isolating children and those pinged by the app, people who are not on benefits are not automatically eligible. They have to apply for discretionary funding instead. Charities have said that could mean people who are in the process of applying for benefits such as Universal Credit - but who have not yet completed the process - do not qualify. ""Ultimately, people are facing an impossible choice often,"" said Citizens Advice spokesperson Katie Martin. ""They are taking a big hit on their incomes if they can't work from home and they need to self-isolate, but they still have their bills to pay, their food shopping to do, children to care for."" Ms Martin said the support on offer was welcome, but added: ""It's definitely something that we'd like the government to look again at - to see what else they can do to make sure people can do the right thing."" Oliver, from Weymouth in Dorset, told the BBC he discovered he was not entitled to any support after receiving a notification from the app to self-isolate. ""I have a young family, there's seven of us who rely on my income,"" he said. ""I want to follow the guidelines but they leave you in the lurch a bit without the financial support. It's been a rough year - that financial burden feels like a massive injustice."" ""They leave you in the lurch,"" says Oliver, who was told to self-isolate without financial support The charity Working Families has also urged Chancellor Rishi Sunak to discuss eligibility, raising concerns that some working parents have had no choice but to miss work to look after children. Many parents have children who have been forced to isolate because of cases in their school ""bubble"", for example. Shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said: ""The prime minister is lucky he can self-isolate from the comfort of his home and carry on working, but for many people that's not an option. ""Many people will be astonished to find that people using the Covid-19 app can't access support to self-isolate - even if they're eligible for the payment."" She said the prime minister should ""use his own period of self-isolation to fix this broken system"". The Department of Health and Social Care said self-isolation was ""vital to stopping the spread of the virus"" and added that a range of support was available to people on low incomes. NHS Test and Trace contact tracers will make people aware of the support and tell them how to apply, the department said. ""We are actively exploring ways to expand the payment scheme to include those who are advised by the app to self-isolate because of close contact with somebody who has tested positive,"" the spokesperson said.

"Almost one in five shops in Wales are now empty, according to the Welsh Retail Consortium. The vacancy rate increased from 15.9% to 18% in the third quarter of this year, the largest jump anywhere in the UK. However, more independent shops are opening up in town centres, business leaders have said. The Welsh Government said it provided Â£90m at the start of the year to support town centres. It added it had made a further Â£9m available to help towns recover from the coronavirus pandemic. The north-east of England, with 18.6%, was the only region in the UK to have a higher vacancy rate than Wales. Greater London had the lowest figure with 10%. Coronavirus drives shop closures to new record Home working trend could 'revive the High Street' Shopping centres and high streets have the most empty units in Wales - 20.8% and 18.6% respectively. Retail parks had the lowest, 8.6%, but this figure increased from 6.9% in the second quarter of 2020. The Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group owns Peacocks, Jaeger and Bonmarche Cardiff-basedPeacocks became the latest chain to collapse into administrationon Thursday and is one of a number to hit trouble in 2020. It comes two weeks after its owner, the Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group (EWM),put its eponymous shops into the same process. This time last year, thegroup was rescuing Bonmarche from administration, while River Island and Topshop have also closed stores in Wales. Furniture and fashion chain Laura Ashley also fell into administration in March, resulting in the closure of its factory in Newtown, Powys in June, whileDebenhams warned in April it would close four of its Welsh stores in a dispute over business rates. The south Wales valleys town of Aberdare could lose three shops on the same street - but the head of its business improvement district is optimistic for the future Some towns, such as Aberdare in Rhondda Cynon Taf, are home to multiple stores from EWM and face losing several shops at the same time if the company is not saved. Dawn Penny, manager of Our Aberdare - the town's business improvement district, said she was optimistic the town could thrive despite the threat of three shops closing. Peacocks, Bonmarche and New Look - all within a few hundred yards of each other on the town's Cardiff Street - could close. ""Everyone notices it [when shops close],"" she said. ""Obviously it's a change, but through change you can grab opportunity. ""It's not just Aberdare and it's not just Wales, and I think there's a change happening because of the pandemic... the feeling among independent business owners is really positive at the moment."" Ms Penny said some empty shops may be too large and business rates too high to be attractive to smaller businesses, but could be split into smaller units in order to fill them. ""I definitely think Aberdare has the potential to thrive,"" she added. How will arcade shops cope with social distancing? Meet the new faces hoping to make it on the High Street The positive feeling among independent business owners in Aberdare is one replicated in other parts of Wales, Pam Poynton from Bangor's business improvement district said. Ms Poynton said the city, which is home to Wales' longest high street, has seen Topshop, H&M and the Body Shop close recently, but their place has been taken by independent shops. Peacocks in Bangor had closing down signs in September, but independent businesses are filling the void She said: ""We've got a lot more people taking up smaller shops and the big ones are sort of going. It's a bit like a David and Goliath situation. ""The smaller stores seem to be outdoing the bigger stores at the moment. I think people are supporting the local shops, and I suppose now people are thinking that if they want a shop to stay open they have to support it. ""I think sometimes people are fearful of change and with Covid we don't know what's going to happen. But things people have forecasted don't seem to be happening at the moment. We've had some closures but we've got some new ones opening."" In Llandudno, Conwy county, business mentor Peter Denton said the town had ""weathered the stormy retail waters"" better than most. He said there had been a move towards coffee and tea shops on the high street, but it had ""far fewer empty shops than most towns"". He added the town's relatively isolated position on the northern coast of Wales helped it retain certain businesses, which may be an advantage in the future. Sara Jones, head of the Welsh Retail Consortium, said it was important businesses were able to stay on the high street, and a mix of chains and independent shops was crucial. Sara Jones said shopping areas must offer a mix of chains and independent stores ""We think chain closures will have a big impact, in the sense that the high street relies on being a multi-offer retail site,"" she said. ""It's a challenge because when we lose one of these it has knock-on consequences. It has a large impact on that community because a lot of those stores will be big employers. ""Having different types of business is more helpful and more attractive. It shouldn't be about attracting less big stores and bringing in more independents... if we're going to see a repurposed high street, we have to have both. ""We could still see a high street that's vibrant but it [depends on] how much now the government looks to a recovery plan that puts retail at the forefront."" The Welsh Government said it had provided funding to improve more than 50 town centres. It said: ""We announced a further Â£90m of support for town centres through our Transforming Towns approach at the start of the year. ""We have also made up to Â£9 million available to support town centres recover from the coronavirus pandemic, enabling town-centre adaptations to support current circumstances and also drive footfall in the future.""

"If you are told to self-isolate by the NHS Covid app, you do not qualify for a Â£500 support grant The government has been urged to expand eligibility for self-isolation support grants in England. Currently, people asked to stay at home by the NHS Covid app do not qualify for the Â£500 grant given to those on low incomes who are told to self-isolate by NHS Test and Trace. Parents who have to stay at home to look after children who are self-isolating are also excluded. Citizens Advice said it meant people faced an ""impossible choice"". People faced having to take a ""big hit"" to their income and might end up struggling with bills in order to help stop the spread of the virus, the charity said. The government said it was exploring how to expand the system to cover those advised to isolate by the app. And speaking to the BBC, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the government was also looking at ways of reducing the isolation period. NHS Covid-19 app to issue more self-isolate alerts Why payday is different during the crisis Why did test-and-trace app contact its boss? The support scheme is designed to help people who cannot work from home and lose income because they are self-isolating. If you test positive, you are provided with a code, which you can use to apply for the grant. But a number of loopholes have emerged - which charities say need to be addressed. As well as parents looking after isolating children and those pinged by the app, people who are not on benefits are not automatically eligible. They have to apply for discretionary funding instead. Charities have said that could mean people who are in the process of applying for benefits such as Universal Credit - but who have not yet completed the process - do not qualify. ""Ultimately, people are facing an impossible choice often,"" said Citizens Advice spokesperson Katie Martin. ""They are taking a big hit on their incomes if they can't work from home and they need to self-isolate, but they still have their bills to pay, their food shopping to do, children to care for."" Ms Martin said the support on offer was welcome, but added: ""It's definitely something that we'd like the government to look again at - to see what else they can do to make sure people can do the right thing."" Oliver, from Weymouth in Dorset, told the BBC he discovered he was not entitled to any support after receiving a notification from the app to self-isolate. ""I have a young family, there's seven of us who rely on my income,"" he said. ""I want to follow the guidelines but they leave you in the lurch a bit without the financial support. It's been a rough year - that financial burden feels like a massive injustice."" ""They leave you in the lurch,"" says Oliver, who was told to self-isolate without financial support The charity Working Families has also urged Chancellor Rishi Sunak to discuss eligibility, raising concerns that some working parents have had no choice but to miss work to look after children. Many parents have children who have been forced to isolate because of cases in their school ""bubble"", for example. Shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said: ""The prime minister is lucky he can self-isolate from the comfort of his home and carry on working, but for many people that's not an option. ""Many people will be astonished to find that people using the Covid-19 app can't access support to self-isolate - even if they're eligible for the payment."" She said the prime minister should ""use his own period of self-isolation to fix this broken system"". The Department of Health and Social Care said self-isolation was ""vital to stopping the spread of the virus"" and added that a range of support was available to people on low incomes. NHS Test and Trace contact tracers will make people aware of the support and tell them how to apply, the department said. ""We are actively exploring ways to expand the payment scheme to include those who are advised by the app to self-isolate because of close contact with somebody who has tested positive,"" the spokesperson said.

"On Saturday night, Californians will be under stay-at-home orders after 22:00 California has begun a night-time curfew, in an attempt to curb a surge in coronavirus cases. The western state's latest figures are now worse than the previous peak in August, the Los Angeles Times reports. Across the US, the daily death toll linked to Covid-19 has passed 2,000 for the first time since May. The country has now more than 12 million confirmed infections, with more than 255,000 deaths, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. This is by far the highest death toll in the world. About 187,000 new infections were recorded nationwide in the latest figures - released on Friday for the previous day - which is an all-time high. Several states have imposed new mask mandates and restrictions to try to combat the rise, and in Texas the National Guard is being deployed to the city of El Paso to help with morgue operations there. Is this Covid wave in the US the worst yet? A US city engulfed by Covid, but no lockdown Where has been hit hardest? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has also urged Americans to avoid travelling for the Thanksgiving holiday on 26 November to prevent increased transmissions. Thanksgiving typically heralds the busiest week for travel in the US. Last year, an estimated 26 million people  passed through the country's airports in the week surrounding the holiday. On Friday, it was revealed thatPresident Donald Trump's oldest son, Donald Trump Jr, had tested positive for coronavirus. ""Apparently I got the 'rona,"" he said in a video on social media, adding that he was asymptomatic so far and quarantining. California reported a total of one million cases last week, making it the second state to do so after Texas. The new daily curfew, from 22:00 local time on Saturday (06:00 GMT Sunday) until 05:00, will carry on until 21 December, with a possible extension if needed, according to authorities. Restaurants will be able to offer takeout and delivery outside these hours. This video can not be played How effective is getting a Covid test before you travel for Thanksgiving? The stay-at-home order affects 41 out of California's 58 counties, covering more than 94% of the state's population. Some 40m people live in California, the most populous state in the US. Some counties have also warned that a more severe lockdown could follow. The latest measures are not as strict as restrictions imposed between March and May, when all nonessential business and travel was prohibited. Other places, including New York City, are also operating a night-time curfew. Bars, restaurants and gyms are allowed to open until 22:00, but schools have been closed. The Californian curfew was announced by Governor Gavin Newsom. ""The virus is spreading at a pace we haven't seen since the start of this pandemic, and the next several days and weeks will be critical to stop the surge,"" he wrote in a statement. Hospital admissions are up 61% statewide in the last two weeks, according to the Los Angeles Times newspaper. ""The data looks really bad right now,"" said Los Angeles County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer on Friday. The CDC has recommended that Americans ""consider"" avoiding Thanksgiving travel and gatherings. ""It's not a requirement. It's a recommendation,"" said Dr Henry Walke, the CDC's Covid-19 incident manager, on Thursday. The following day, President Donald Trump re-tweeted the words of Republican Congressman Jim Jordan: ""Don't lockdown the country. Don't impose curfews. Don't close schools. Let Americans decide for themselves. And celebrate Thanksgiving."" The president and President-elect Joe Biden have both said they are against imposing a national lockdown, and favour letting states come up with their own rules. Californian authorities permit up to three households meeting outdoors On Thursday, the White House coronavirus task force had its first public briefing in months. Members, including Vice-President Mike Pence, noted the rise in coronavirus cases. The task force said indoor gatherings should be limited over the next couple of weeks. However on Saturday, US media noted that Mr Pence's wife, Karen, had sent out an invitation for a ""Christmas craft"" get-together at their home on 9 December for Congressional Club members. The White House has also so far declined to engage with Joe Biden and his incoming administration on policy, as Mr Trump refuses to concede the presidential contest.

"The Joanna C, registered in Brixham in Devon, sank three miles off the coast at Seaford A search for two missing fishermen whose boat sank off the Sussex coast has been called off. A major rescue effort began at Seaford, near Newhaven, on Saturday when the coastguard received an emergency alert at about 06:00 GMT. One crew member was found clinging to a buoy and taken to hospital. Despite an extensive search for two other crew members, the coastguard confirmed it had terminated efforts to find them at 15:00 GMT. The emergency signal put the 45ft scalloping vessel, which was registered in Brixham, about three nautical miles off the coast. Throughout Saturday a number of vessels, including local fishing boats, took part in the search. Eastbourne and Newhaven's RNLI lifeboats, two coastguard rescue helicopters and a fixed wing aircraft, and Birling Gap and Beachy Head Coastguard Rescue Teams were all involved, as were 12 other vessels which responded to appeals for help. Throughout Saturday a number of vessels took part in the search Chris Thomas, deputy director of HM Coastguard said its National Maritime Operations Centre co-ordinated Saturday's rescue effort ""with many units searching tirelessly since first light"". He continued: ""Sadly two other crewmen have not yet been found and all our thoughts are with their families and friends. ""It is testament to the local maritime community that HM Coastguard was so admirably supported throughout the day by nearby vessels and the local fishing communities, who joined us in force and made strenuous efforts to locate their colleagues during the search."" On Saturday, HM Coastguard controller Piers Stanbury said debris had been located close to where the alert had originated. Helen Lovell, from the Fishermen's Mission in Brixham, said the community was ""really pulling together"" and ""lighting candles and putting them in their windows"" to show they were thinking of the missing men.

"Witnesses spoke about seeing a large number of officers and emergency vehicles in the city centre Six people have been taken to hospital following a large scale ""violent disturbance"" in Cardiff city centre. Police and ambulance crews were called to Queen Street at about 21:50 GMT on Saturday. One person suffered head injuries and is in a serious condition and three others are thought to have been stabbed, South Wales Police said. Four people, aged 16 and 17, have been arrested on suspicion of violent disorder. On Sunday, police said three people remained at Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales, with another at Llandough Hospital, Penarth. None of the injuries are believed to life-threatening. Police said a Taser was also used to detain one man who was obstructing officers, although he was not believed to have been involved in the disorder. Officers were alerted by ""multiple reports"" of a ""large disturbance"" on Queen Street and an investigation is under way. Det Supt Esyr Jones said: ""I'd urge any parent who suspects their child was involved in any way to come forward. ""Tackling knife crime is the responsibility of us all and any parents who have suspicions about their children being involved are not protecting them by remaining quiet."" Allow Twitter content?

Part of Queen Street remained cordoned off on Sunday morning Det Supt Jones said: ""This was a violent and completely unacceptable incident which has understandably caused alarm within the local community.

"A woman confronts a soldier at Whiterock in Belfast during the Troubles ""I really got my eyes opened - I was really, really scared."" When the violence of the Troubles erupted in Northern Ireland, it was press photographers like Paul Faith who were there to capture it. He and many others were effectively thrust into the role of war photographers - except the bloodshed was not half a world away, but on the streets of their own towns. These people witnessed some of the worst atrocities of the conflict. Now, seven of them have shared their experiences in a film to be broadcast on Monday night. Shooting the Darkness - which features personal testimony, archive footage and still images - reflects on how many went from working on sport or farming news to portraying images of almost unimaginable pain and suffering. Ten chapters of the NI Troubles - 1988,external Initially, Paul Faith was an onlooker to the horror of the Troubles, a 30-year period of conflict which saw 3,500 people killed and many more injured. ""The daily work would be town hall receptions, dinners, unfurling of Orange banners, parades in the town, cheque presentations - and I was just bursting to get out to do news,"" he told the documentary. ""I would go home at night, turn on the news and there were bombs going off in Belfast, people being killed. It was just mayhem elsewhere. I just needed to get out, I felt as if it was just my calling."" Soldiers running from a bomb in the Smithfield area of Belfast On one of his first assignments, he recalls shaking ""from one end of the road for three miles to the other end"" as he covered a republican parade protesting against internment, a government policy to imprison people without trial. ""You could see the vengeance and the hatred. The soldiers were scared, the republicans were vicious to them and it was just a completely different world,"" he said. He talks about republicans being very ""media savvy"" at that time. Photographer Paul Faith was thrust into a different role when violence erupted in Northern Ireland An abiding memory was the 1998 funeral of IRA man Brendan Burns, when he captured the moment Sinn FÃ©in's Martin McGuinness stood beside the coffin, alongside masked men. ""It was bandit country. The Army and police were there in force with riot shields. We weren't sure what was going to happen, but we knew if something did happen it was going to be bad,"" he said. Paul Faith captured this scene at the funeral of IRA man Brendan Burns ""As the service was ending, the coffin was going to come out, the Chinooks [helicopters] were landing, six IRA guys appeared in full camouflage gear, fully masked, berets the whole lot. ""At the coffin, McGuinness was at the front on the right-hand side, no words were spoken."" He added: ""The Provos had played their ace; they got what they wanted in this picture of Martin McGuinness beside the IRA guys, carrying the coffin."" March 1988 saw escalating violence culminating in some of the most infamous imagery to emerge from the Troubles. A fortnight of brutal violence began with the shooting dead of three IRA members in Gibraltar by the Army. Later that month, their funeral at Milltown Cemetery was attacked by loyalist Michael Stone. Three people were killed, dozens were wounded. Martin Nangle said it is better to treat what he does as a job, and not get too involved Three days later, as one of Stone's victims was being buried, the mourners were said to be fearful of another attack. On the scene was photographer Martin Nangle - who captured some of the most memorable images of that day, images that would be beamed around the world. He was there working when two plain-clothed British soldiers drove into the path of the funeral. Corporals Derek Wood and David Howes were dragged out of a car and beaten. They were later stripped and shot dead by the IRA, their bodies dumped on waste ground. Martin Nangle took a series of photographs of the scene in Andersonstown more than 30 years ago before the soldiers were killed Martin was on hand to capture what happened - but feared the footage would be confiscated as cameramen had been threatened and told to stop filming. ""It became pretty evident that if I wanted to get this story out what was in the camera had to be taken out and new film put into the camera, wound on, reeled up - so that if I was asked for the film I would open the camera and rip it out and it would look like it was being destroyed,"" he said. ""It worked insofar as the story got out and the images got out."" Martin said he always looked out for a picture that would help describe the narrative of the Troubles. ""When I saw Belfast for the first time, I was quite shocked at the degree of decaying grandeur, so to speak, that was happening all over the city. This proud Victorian city [was] basically rotting around us,"" he said. But he knew he had to document the effect violence had on the people and the social fabric of Northern Ireland. ""It's probably better to view the world when you are in a situation like that from behind a camera,"" he said. ""Your mental process is going through composition, when to make that decision to press the shutter. ""Staying behind the camera is a safety valve to separate yourself from sinking into the event and becoming part of it, which is what you don't want to do. ""It's better just to treat it as a job, as an observer and not to get too close."" It's a view echoed by Paul Faith. ""Your only saving grace was you had a camera. You had something physically in front of you. In a way, it was probably like watching a TV screen."" But he added: ""You couldn't do this job without being touched.""

"This video can not be played Flames rose from the building's large windows Hundreds of anti-government protesters in Guatemala have vandalised and set fire to parts of the Congress building, before being dispersed by riot police. The building in Guatemala City was empty at the time of Saturday's attack, which lasted for about 10 minutes. The fire services put the fire out, but several people were treated for the effects of smoke inhalation. The protesters are opposed to a budget approved by Congress of the Central American country on Wednesday night. An office inside the building went up in flames - but the overall extent of the damage is not known A number of protesters were detained by police The opposition says the budget prioritises big infrastructure projects to be handled by companies with government connections and overlooks the social and economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. They are also angered by what they describe as major cuts to education and health spending. How virus is threatening Central America's lifeline Storm Eta kills at least 50 in Guatemala Conservative elected Guatemalan president Guatemala country profile Another key complaints is that the budget was passed by parliament while the rest of the country was distracted by the after-effects of two damaging storms, Eta and Iota. The protesters are now pressing for President Alejandro Giammattei to resign. The bulk of Saturday's demonstrations, which some observers said were the biggest yet against the budget, were peaceful.

"On Saturday night, Californians will be under stay-at-home orders after 22:00 California has begun a night-time curfew, in an attempt to curb a surge in coronavirus cases. The western state's latest figures are now worse than the previous peak in August, the Los Angeles Times reports. Across the US, the daily death toll linked to Covid-19 has passed 2,000 for the first time since May. The country has now more than 12 million confirmed infections, with more than 255,000 deaths, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. This is by far the highest death toll in the world. About 187,000 new infections were recorded nationwide in the latest figures - released on Friday for the previous day - which is an all-time high. Several states have imposed new mask mandates and restrictions to try to combat the rise, and in Texas the National Guard is being deployed to the city of El Paso to help with morgue operations there. Is this Covid wave in the US the worst yet? A US city engulfed by Covid, but no lockdown Where has been hit hardest? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has also urged Americans to avoid travelling for the Thanksgiving holiday on 26 November to prevent increased transmissions. Thanksgiving typically heralds the busiest week for travel in the US. Last year, an estimated 26 million people  passed through the country's airports in the week surrounding the holiday. On Friday, it was revealed thatPresident Donald Trump's oldest son, Donald Trump Jr, had tested positive for coronavirus. ""Apparently I got the 'rona,"" he said in a video on social media, adding that he was asymptomatic so far and quarantining. California reported a total of one million cases last week, making it the second state to do so after Texas. The new daily curfew, from 22:00 local time on Saturday (06:00 GMT Sunday) until 05:00, will carry on until 21 December, with a possible extension if needed, according to authorities. Restaurants will be able to offer takeout and delivery outside these hours. This video can not be played How effective is getting a Covid test before you travel for Thanksgiving? The stay-at-home order affects 41 out of California's 58 counties, covering more than 94% of the state's population. Some 40m people live in California, the most populous state in the US. Some counties have also warned that a more severe lockdown could follow. The latest measures are not as strict as restrictions imposed between March and May, when all nonessential business and travel was prohibited. Other places, including New York City, are also operating a night-time curfew. Bars, restaurants and gyms are allowed to open until 22:00, but schools have been closed. The Californian curfew was announced by Governor Gavin Newsom. ""The virus is spreading at a pace we haven't seen since the start of this pandemic, and the next several days and weeks will be critical to stop the surge,"" he wrote in a statement. Hospital admissions are up 61% statewide in the last two weeks, according to the Los Angeles Times newspaper. ""The data looks really bad right now,"" said Los Angeles County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer on Friday. The CDC has recommended that Americans ""consider"" avoiding Thanksgiving travel and gatherings. ""It's not a requirement. It's a recommendation,"" said Dr Henry Walke, the CDC's Covid-19 incident manager, on Thursday. The following day, President Donald Trump re-tweeted the words of Republican Congressman Jim Jordan: ""Don't lockdown the country. Don't impose curfews. Don't close schools. Let Americans decide for themselves. And celebrate Thanksgiving."" The president and President-elect Joe Biden have both said they are against imposing a national lockdown, and favour letting states come up with their own rules. Californian authorities permit up to three households meeting outdoors On Thursday, the White House coronavirus task force had its first public briefing in months. Members, including Vice-President Mike Pence, noted the rise in coronavirus cases. The task force said indoor gatherings should be limited over the next couple of weeks. However on Saturday, US media noted that Mr Pence's wife, Karen, had sent out an invitation for a ""Christmas craft"" get-together at their home on 9 December for Congressional Club members. The White House has also so far declined to engage with Joe Biden and his incoming administration on policy, as Mr Trump refuses to concede the presidential contest.

"Witnesses spoke about seeing a large number of officers and emergency vehicles in the city centre Six people have been taken to hospital following a large scale ""violent disturbance"" in Cardiff city centre. Police and ambulance crews were called to Queen Street at about 21:50 GMT on Saturday. One person suffered head injuries and is in a serious condition and three others are thought to have been stabbed, South Wales Police said. Four people, aged 16 and 17, have been arrested on suspicion of violent disorder. On Sunday, police said three people remained at Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales, with another at Llandough Hospital, Penarth. None of the injuries are believed to life-threatening. Police said a Taser was also used to detain one man who was obstructing officers, although he was not believed to have been involved in the disorder. Officers were alerted by ""multiple reports"" of a ""large disturbance"" on Queen Street and an investigation is under way. Det Supt Esyr Jones said: ""I'd urge any parent who suspects their child was involved in any way to come forward. ""Tackling knife crime is the responsibility of us all and any parents who have suspicions about their children being involved are not protecting them by remaining quiet."" Allow Twitter content?

""Patrols have been stepped up in the area and a dedicated team continues to investigate Saturday's incident,"" he added. Police cordons were put up around a number of streets Forensic investigations continued into the night An eyewitness said she saw one man being Tasered by police Eyewitness Elizabeth Winter said: ""Some groups of young lads seemed to be getting into altercations with the police. Then there was another man that was Tasered twice."" Cardiff student Amogh George, 24, said he saw up to 30 police officers around Queen Street and the Capitol Shopping Centre after being alerted by ""a lot of sirens"". ""People spoke about a brawl but I didn't see what was happening,"" said the journalism student. Cordons remained in place on Queen Street on Sunday morning. Part of Queen Street remained cordoned off on Sunday morning Det Supt Jones said: ""This was a violent and completely unacceptable incident which has understandably caused alarm within the local community.

"Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby has warned Boris Johnson against cutting the UK's overseas aid budget. The government wants to reduce the annual spendfrom 0.7% of national income to 0.5%. But Mr Welby said ""helping the world's poorest is one of the great moral and ethical achievements of our country"". The archbishop, who will take a three-month sabbatical in May next year, said any recovery from the pandemic required ""a global response"". ""In his teaching, Jesus Christ tells us we mustn't limit our concept of neighbour simply to those close by to us. We need to heed that message in the tough times, as well as the good. ""Keeping our aid commitment is a strong signal that the UK is a reliable partner for long-term economic, social, environmental and educational advancement across the globe,"" the archbishop said. UK aid is distributed with the aim of protecting public health and alleviating global poverty Reports earlier this week that the government was considering cutting Â£4bn from the overseas aid budget have met strong resistance. In recent days, 185 charities, two former prime ministers, opposition parties and senior Tories have all urged the government to think again. Microsoft founder Bill Gates is the latest public figure to call on the British government to protect the foreign aid budget at next week's spending review. ""It's never made less sense to cut foreign aid than right now,"" said the billionaire philanthropist. ""Covid-19 has reminded us viruses don't respect border laws; they don't check your passport before entering your lungs. The only way the UK - or any country - will be free of this virus is if every country is. ""This is a moment when what's good for the world - and what's good for the UK - are exactly the same thing."" Cameron and Blair warn against aid budget cut Austerity after virus catastrophic, says Welby UK's foreign aid spending cut by Â£2.9bn Spending on foreign aid is linked to the UK's national income - its GDP - which has been badly impacted by the pandemic. The government has already announced a Â£2.9bn cut from the budget for the rest of 2020 in order to avoid over-shooting the 0.7% target. The 0.7% target, initially proposed by the United Nations in the 1970s, was first adopted in the UK by Tony Blair's Labour government in 2005. However, it was not actually reached until 2013 - under the coalition government, led by David Cameron. Both Mr Blair and Mr Cameron have criticised any suggestion of a spending reduction, with Mr Cameron calling it a ""moral, strategic and political mistake"". But, with UK's national debt now over Â£2 trillion, some Conservatives have argued money should be re-directed to domestic priorities. Mr Welby said Britain's ""generosity"" gave the UK ""massive influence for good globally"". It comes as Lambeth Palace, the London home of the archbishop, announced Mr Welby would take three months of planned leave next year, studying in either Cambridge or the United States. He will use his time off for ""reflection, prayer, and spiritual renewal"", but will remain in regular contact with his staff while away, the palace added. Mr Welby's sabbatical was due to begin following the Lambeth Conference this year, but it was postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic. He is expected to resume his official duties in September 2021.

"Ten more people in Northern Ireland have died after contracting Covid-19, taking the Department of Health's total of recorded deaths to 923. Another 357 people have tested positive for the virus, taking the overall number of confirmed cases to 49,442. The figures come a day after some businesses reopened ahead ofa two-week lockdown from 27 November. The restrictions have beencriticised by some businessesbut First Minister Arlene Foster has defended the move. The DUP leader denied that her party had performed a U-turn by agreeing to tighter Covid-19 restrictions one week aftervoting against measures proposed to the Stormont Executive. She said the executive ""had to act"" given that the R-number - the average number of people that one infected person will pass the virus to - was close to one. The evidence ""had changed"" in what was put to ministers at Thursday's executive meeting,"" she added. What is a circuit-breaker and can one fight Covid? What do NI's new restrictions mean for you? Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said it was the ""correct decision"". Health Minister Robin Swann said the latest restrictions were necessary but accepted they were ""equivalent of going back to where we were in March and April"".

"People in flats with and without cladding have been left unable to move without the safety checks Safety checks that left thousands of people unable to sell their flats after the Grenfell disaster are being eased. Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said homes without cladding would no longer need an EWS1 external wall safety certificate - which involves a survey. Thousands of people have been refused mortgages on flats because owners have been unable to get the surveys done. But mortgage lenders said they ""did not consent"" to the announcement of the changes. They also questioned how many homeowners would benefit. The checks were introduced after 72 people died at Grenfell Tower when a fire spread along outside walls. To begin with, only those who owned flats in tall buildings with dangerous flammable cladding were affected. But in January the government extended its advice to smaller properties and mortgage lenders began demanding fire surveys from a much wider range group of sellers. Cladding red tape 'stops people selling homes' Imprisoned by cladding: The flat owners who cannot sell With fewer than 300 qualified surveyors for hundreds of thousands of properties, many owners have been unable to access them, leaving them stuck, unable to sell or remortgage. Earlier, Mr Jenrick announced he had ""secured agreement"" that the survey would not be needed for homes without cladding. ""Through no fault of their own, some flat owners have been unable to sell or remortgage their homes, and this cannot be allowed to continue,"" he said. The housing secretary said the decision to ease checks for blocks without cladding would help almost 450,000 homeowners who ""may have felt stuck in limbo"". The building safety ministerLord Greenhalgh tweeted,externalthat the chairman of the lenders association UK Finance, and the chief executive of the Building Societies Association, had confirmed ""EWS1 forms are not and have never been required"" for buildings without cladding. Despite that some people without cladding, have previously been asked to obtain an EWS form and both bodies said in a statement they ""did not consent"" to being included in the announcement. A finance industry source with knowledge of the negotiations told the BBC the proposal did not mean properties with issues other than cladding would automatically be exempt from a fire survey. The source said buildings with wooden balconies, and other safety issues, should have been included among those which still required the external fire safety checks. It would still depend on the decision of a ""suitably qualified, independent and properly insured surveyor"", the source said. They did not recognise the figure of 450,000 homeowners stuck in limbo. Only a ""small subset"" of buildings would benefit from the announcement, the UK Cladding Action Group said. Estimates by the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government suggested that more than 800,000 homes would still require the EWS1. Some blocks which appeared to be built from solid brick were in fact ""clad with unknown materials behind the brick"", UK Finance and the Building Societies Association warned. The Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors said it had agreed the announcement that buildings without cladding did not need the EWS1 assessments, but it added that it would still need to review the government advice before deciding what guidance to issue to surveyors. Sean Tompkins, RICS chief executive, said there had been an ""acute market shortage of fire engineers"" to carry out the checks. ""We are aware of the severe impact this has had on some homeowners and we agree that buildings without cladding should not be subject to the process,"" he said. Mr Jenrick also said the government was paying to train 2,000 more assessors within six months to speed up checks on blocks which did have cladding. But some cladding experts questioned whether the Â£700,000 in government funding would be enough. ""Do they think they can just give these people a two-day training course for Â£350?"" said Adrian Buckmaster, director of Tetraclad. ""You can't train experience in the built environment.""
