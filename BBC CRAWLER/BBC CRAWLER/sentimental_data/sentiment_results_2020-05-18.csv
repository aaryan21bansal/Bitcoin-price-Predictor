Now Netflix and Amazon are to  resume production in France, reports Variety magazine. Two big-budget films by Pathe will also resume shooting in Paris in June. Work on Amazon series ""Voltaire, Mixte"" is expected to restart in mid-July in the south of France. Netflix's ""Arsene Lupin"", which was filming at the Louvre museum in Paris, will resume in September. The French government has established a fund of â¬50 million ($54 million) for film and TV productions that have been interrupted or canceled during the pandemic. When France went into lockdown in March,a Paris street film set had to be abandoned,,externalleaving its residents in 1942 Nazi occupied France. Hope for the outcome of a US trial for a Covid-19 vaccine drove a surge in global stocks on Monday. Wall Street made large gains, with the S&P rising 3.2%, the Dow Jones 4% and the Nasdaq 2.4%. While it is hard to pinpoint an exact cause for the surge, it seems to have been boosted by an announcement from Moderna that it had seen positive results in eight people given doses in its early vaccine trials. The rallies also saw a large increase in the price of US crude oil - its biggest hike in two months - leading to a proclamation from the US president that ""oil (energy) is back!!!!"" Captain Tom Moore captured the hearts of the UK, raising more than Â£32m for charity, and now he has inspired another World War Two veteran to do the same. Private Joseph Hammond - a 95-year-old from Ghana - has set himself the challenge of walking two miles a day for a week to raise money for coronavirus charities. He hopes to raise $600,000 (Â£500,000) for frontline workers and vulnerable veterans across Africa. Private Hammond fought with the British army in Burma, in the Gold Coast Regiment of the Royal West African Frontier Force. Greece has had a total of 2,834 cases and 163 deaths from coronavirus Greece has urged the UK to exempt Greeks from a planned quarantine for arrivals to Britain. It would be in return for British people being able to enter Greece. The British government has said it will introduce a 14-day quarantine for all arrivals to the UK with the exception of Ireland from early June. But on Monday the UK transport secretary saidpeople coming from countries with low rates of infectioncould be exempted in the future. ""The kind of aggressiveness this country (the UK) is showing in making the decisions is totally understandable,"" Greek tourism minister Harris Theoharis told the BBC. ""What I can say is we think this is a time for us to start lifting restrictions, and to try and remove as many barriers as possible."" The Greek economy is heavily reliant on tourism. The EU last week promised thatEurope will have a summer tourist seasonin some form. The Greek tourism minister was speaking the BBC's Coronavirus Newscast. Listenhere  US President Donald Trump has said he is taking hydroxychloroquine in an attempt to ward off coronavirus. Trump has previously touted the malaria drug as a treatment for coronavirus, but there is scant scientific evidence it can fight off Covid-19. Clinical trials are under way to see if it is at all effective. ""I'm taking it for about a week and a half now and I'm still here, I'm still here,"" Trump told reporters on Monday. Asked what  evidence he had for he drug's positive benefits, Mr Trump said: ""Here's my evidence, I get a lot of positive calls about it."" The US coronavirus death toll has passed 90,000, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The US toll now stands 90,312 - the highest of any nation in the world. The UK has reported the second highest death toll with 34,876, followed by Italy with 32,007. France's highest administrative court has ruled the government must lift a blanket ban on meetings at places of
worship imposed as part of measures to combat the coronavirus, AFP reports. The latest rules ban all gatherings in places of worship except funerals which are limited to 20 people. The Council of State has ruled such a ban
on freedom of worship caused ""a damage that is serious and manifestly
illegal"" and is ""disproportionate in nature."" It told the government to lift
the ban within the next eight days. Tony Blair has spoken to BBC Newsnight about coronavirus and global leadership Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair has said in a BBC interview that it is right to reopen schools. Speaking amid a row about the safety of bringing teachers and children back to the classroom from 1 June, he says he believes the government's approach is based on evidence. ""I donât think they would say that theyâre putting school opening above health risks. What theyâre doing is basing it on the evidence, actually. There are countries that have reopened parts, at least, of their school system. ""If you look at all the best evidence, and my institute has assembled a lot of the different data on this, especially for younger children, the risks of transmission are actually quite low."" Blair, who runs the Tony Blair Institute For Global Change, also said he was shocked by ""the absence of global leadership"" in particular from the US. The West should ""stand together"" in a new relationship with China, he says. ""I think we need a strategic response to China, not simply ad-hoc or reactive response on individual issues or questions."" The full Newsnight interview can be seen at 22.30 BST on BBC Two Western New York is expected to begin reopening on Tuesday, according to New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. The region - which contains Niagara Falls - will join Central New York, Finger Lakes, Mohawk Valley, North County and Southern Tier in phase-one reopening. This means parts of the economy including retail, agriculture, construction and manufacturing may soon start up again. There were 106 coronavirus-related deaths yesterday in New York state, taking the total to more than 28,000. Cuomo also used his press briefing to announce that he wants professional sports teams to start competing again without fans in attendance. ""Hockey, basketball, baseball, football, whoever can reopen. We're a ready, willing and able partner,"" he said. BBC OS We spoke to three new mothers about giving birth and caring for their new child during a pandemic. Here are their stories. Brooke Young Russellis in New York City. She had her son on 12 April, and had to wear a mask while giving birth to him as she was right next to coronavirus patients in the hospital. She was initially told that her partner couldn't be with her for the birth, but then thousands signed a petition to get the hospital to reverse its decision, which it did. ""My mom hasn't met my son yet and that is traumatising for me... my family's absence feels so much stronger now because there's no way that they can be here. The fact that my mother hasn't been able to hold her grandson yet just kills me every time."" Salma Ishaqis in London. She gave birth on 10 March, at 27 weeks. Her baby is in hospital and, before lockdown, she and her husband could visit the neonatal unit 24 hours a day. ""When the lockdown came in, the hospital policies changed. In the unit I'm in, dads are not able to visit at all and mums only for two hours. ""Twice he's had to be resuscitated and having to go in by yourself, without your husband being allowed, and going and seeing your baby in an incubator, having the ventilator... I'd kind of gone into this survival mode. Now that it's been two months I've started to process it a bit more."" Vicky Kavanaghis in Dublin, and gave birth in January. ""We live very near to my in-laws and we're very lucky - they're very involved in our lives. They were able to spend a bit of time with their granddaughter before everything kicked in."" ""I always think of all the things she's missing out on. The closeness she should have had with her grandparents. ""There's this whole chapter of her life that only me and her father have witnessed and it's been very isolating for the three of us going through that."" You can listen to the full story here. South Sudan's Vice President Riek Machar and his wife Angelina Teny, the country's defence minister, have tested positive for coronavirus. Machar, who is in his late 60s, was tested on 13 May after one of the members of the government 's Covid-19 task force tested positive. He says he has no symptoms and will self-isolate for the next 14 days. A number of Macharâs bodyguards and staff have also been found positive.

Ray McDermott, 96, is originally from Carmarthenshire, Wales, but she has  lived in the US for 70 years. She worried she would never speak Welsh again after her mother died four decades ago. ""I don't think I'll ever have a chance to speak Welsh again,"" she recently told her son Keith. Worried about his mum's loneliness and memory-loss, Keith put out a call on social media for Welsh speakers. Within 30 minutes, he was deluged with responses. One of those who responded was Melisa Annis - a director and playwright originally from Cardiff but living in New York. She gave Ray a call. ""It's a very hard time at the moment and we are all feeling a little bit isolated and especially if you are older. I thought, 'Why not reach out?' I am a fluent Welsh speaker and very pro the Welsh language,"" Melisa said. Ray's first words in Welsh, after 40 years, were: ""I used to talk in Welsh with my mum."" Read the full story here. In Rome, Italy, a limit on the number of people allowed on trains have been introduced With lockdowns easing across much of Europe and the US, and some sectors returning to work, you might be wondering how safe  public transport is. Many cities are urging commuters to cycle or walk instead of catching a bus or train, but in some cases, there is no other option. A lot of the potential risk of infection on trains and buses depends on how crowded they are, and how far away you can keep from other people. Ventilation also plays an important role as fresh air can help droplets containing the virus dissipate faster. In the UK, the advice for people taking public transport incudes: Read more about the infection risks on public transport.

Work on a coronavirus vaccine has been taking place at unprecedented speed Earlier we reported about a promising early trial for a Covid-19 vaccine produced by Moderna Inc. Share prices in the US pharmaceutical company have shot up. Now, here's some more information about what the vaccine trials have found. In the first eight people who took part in Moderna Inc's trials, antibodies were found that can neutralise coronavirus. Even people taking the lowest dose of the trial vaccine produced antibodies at the same levels seen in patients who recover from Covid-19. But there is still some way to go. Testing for these neutralising antibodies has only taken place on the first eight, out of 45, people on the trial. And it will take larger trials to see if people are protected against the virus. Our Health Correspondent James Gallagher has been delving more deeply into this development. Read more here.  Have you heard the one about the priest who set up a drive-through holy water shooting gallery? Father Tim Pelc, of St Ambrose Parish in Michigan, became a hit online after he came up with a novel solution to blessing church-goers during the coronavirus pandemic. ""You can't double dip into the holy water container,"" he told Today in the US. ""I thought, what could I do that would keep the quarantine restrictions going and give kids the experience of Easter?"" He fired the holy weapon at Easter, but a tweet showing this social distancing solution has now been liked more than 570,000 times. It has even inspired parody art, such as the following effort from Redditor Tomdoerr88: A man desperate to hug his grandmother while protecting her from possible infection has come up with what has been dubbed the ""cuddle curtain"". Footage of the pair enjoying a long-awaited hug has been viewed millions of times on social media. Based on a plastic shower curtain and featuring disposable gloves, it was created by Antony Cauvin, from Stratford-upon-Avon in England. He said he had been thinking about the problem for some time. Despite the easing of some lockdown measures in England, the government is still asking people to avoid meeting up with more than one person at a time from a different household and to maintain a gap of at least two metres at all times.

The latest job cuts come after plans to cut 3,700 jobs were announced earlier this month, meaning around a quarter of the company's jobs will be lost. The workforce cuts do not include drivers, whom Uber considers independent contractors. Uber said it would reorganise its remaining staff and cut back spending in areas that are not part of its core personal transport or food delivery businesses, including its AI Labs. The number of Uber rides dropped 80% around the world last month as the company was hit by coronavirus restrictions. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Trump: ""If it's not good, I'll tell you right, I'm not going to get hurt by it"" US President Donald Trump has said he is taking hydroxychloroquine to ward off coronavirus, despite public health officials warning it may be unsafe. Speaking at the White House, he told reporters he started taking the malaria and lupus medication recently. ""I'm taking it for about a week and a half now and I'm still here, I'm still here,"" was his surprise announcement. There is no evidence hydroxychloroquine can fight coronavirus, and regulators warn the drug may cause heart problems. Dr Marcos Espinal, director of the Pan American Health Organization - part of the World Health Organization (WHO) - has also since stressed that no clinical trials have recommended the use of hydroxychloroquine for coronavirus. The 73-year-old president was hosting a meeting devoted to the struggling restaurant industry on Monday, when he caught reporters unawares by revealing he was taking the drug. ""You'd be surprised at how many people are taking it, especially the frontline workers before you catch it, the frontline workers, many, many are taking it,"" he told reporters. ""I happen to be taking it."" Asked what was his evidence of hydroxychloroquine's positive benefits, Mr Trump said: ""Here's my evidence: I get a lot of positive calls about it."" What's known about anti-malarial drugs and Covid-19? The unproven 'corona drug' US is threatening India for Coronavirus: Where are cases still rising? He added: ""I've heard a lot of good stories [about hydroxychloroquine] and if it's not good, I'll tell you right I'm not going to get hurt by it."" Though some people in the White House have tested positive for coronavirus, the president said again on Monday he had ""zero symptoms"" and was being tested frequently. He added that he had been taking a daily zinc supplement and received a single dose of azithromycin, an antibiotic meant to prevent infection. When asked whether the White House physician had recommended he start taking the disputed remedy, Mr Trump said he himself had requested it. Dr Sean Conley, physician to the president, said in a statement issued through the White House later on Monday that Mr Trump was in ""very good health"" and ""symptom-free"". The US Navy officer added: ""After numerous discussions he and I had regarding the evidence for and against the use of hydroxychloroquine, we concluded the potential benefit from treatment outweighed the relative risks."" The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) last month issued an advisory saying that hydroxychloroquine has ""not been shown to be safe and effective"". It cited reports that the drug can cause serious heart rhythm problems in Covid-19 patients. The FDA warned against use of the medication outside hospitals, where the agency has granted temporary authorisation for its use in some cases. Clinical trials of the drug are also under way. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) says there are no approved drugs or therapeutics to prevent or treat Covid-19, which is confirmed to have infected more than 1.5 million people in the US, killing more than 90,000 patients. I'll have what President Trump's having. No thanks - or rather, not yet. Currently there is no convincing evidence that hydroxychloroquine helps fight the virus and it can cause unpleasant and harmful side effects in some people. In theory, repurposing existing drugs to treat coronavirus is a very good and sound idea (unlike Mr Trump's previous ones about injecting disinfectant or hitting the body with ""tremendous"" UV light). It may be our only hope, at least in the short term, until a vaccine can be found. The UK government has been stockpiling some medicines that might be useful against coronavirus.That includes 16m hydroxychloroquine tablets,external. Clinical trials are under way in the UK and the US to assess the drug's worth. The human guinea pigs taking part include frontline healthcare workers at high risk of exposure to the virus, as well as patients. Experts agree that this work is worth doing, but they are concerned about advocating more general use of these experimental treatments before the proof is in. Dr Stephen Griffin, associate professor at the School of Medicine at the University of Leeds, told me: ""People that follow the president's example might not only endanger themselves but could also deprive patients with chronic autoimmune conditions of their much-needed medication."" Dismissing reports of severe side effects from hydroxychloroquine, the president said: ""All I can tell you is, so far I seem to be OK."" He said the ""only negative"" he had heard was from a ""very unscientific report"" conducted by ""people that aren't big Trump fans"". Mr Trump was apparently referring to a preliminary study from April of Covid-19 patients in US government-run hospitals for military veterans that suggested hydroxychloroquine had no benefit and may have even caused a greater rate of deaths. ""I get a lot of tremendously positive news on the hydroxy,"" the president told reporters, adding: ""What do you have to lose?"" According to doctors, the drug has the potential to cause symptoms including heart failure, suicidal thoughts and signs of liver disease. This video can not be played What's it like to fast for Ramadan as a healthcare worker during the pandemic? Mr Trump's most powerful elected antagonist, the Democratic Speaker of the US House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, could not resist taking a dig at his age and weight when asked on CNN about him taking the malaria medication. ""He's our president and I would rather he not be taking something that has not been approved by the scientists, especially in his age group and in his, shall we say, weight group - morbidly obese, they say,"" she said. Last year, the White House physician noted in Mr Trump's annual medical exam that he weighed 243lb (110kg) and was 6ft 3in, which would score his body mass index at a technically obese 30.4. Senate Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called Mr Trump's decision ""reckless"" but added: ""Who knows if it's true?"" ""He may not have been taking it for all we know. He just likes to make a splash,"" he told MSNBC. ""Maybe he's really not taking it,"" he continued, ""because the president lies about things characteristically-like.""

"Germany's Angela Merkel and France's Emmanuel Macron discussed the fund via video link France and Germany are proposing a â¬500bn ($545bn; Â£448bn) European recovery fund to be distributed to EU countries worst affected by Covid-19. In talks on Monday, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel agreed that the funds should be provided as grants. The proposal represents a significant shift in Mrs Merkel's position. Mr Macron said it was a major step forward and was ""what the eurozone needs to remain united"". ""I believe this is a very deep transformation and that's what the European Union and the single market needed to remain coherent,"" Mr Macron said following discussions via video link. Mrs Merkel, who had previously rejected the idea of nations sharing debt, said the European Commission would raise money for the fund by borrowing on the markets, which would be repaid gradually from the EU's overall budget. Grants provided by the proposed recovery fund should also be used to help finance the bloc's investment in a greener future, the two leaders said. Politics and PR: Behind the scenes of the plan Spain set for basic income to ease crisis pain Coronavirus 'could cost global economy $8.8tn' European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the proposal ""acknowledges the scope and the size of the economic challenge that Europe faces"". European Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde said the plan was ""ambitious, targeted and welcome"". Other EU countries must agree with the proposal, however, and Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz later insisted that his country backed providing loans to member nations hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, rather than grants. ""Our position remains unchanged,"" Mr Kurz wrote in a tweet, adding: ""We expect the updated [EU budget] to reflect the new priorities rather than raising the ceiling."" In EU political terms this is huge. Chancellor Merkel has conceded a lot. She openly agreed with the French that any money from this fund, allocated to a needy EU country, should be a grant, not a loan. Importantly, this means not increasing the debts of economies already weak before the pandemic. President Macron gave ground, too. He had wanted a huge fund of a trillion or more euros. But a trillion euros of grants was probably too much for Mrs Merkel to swallow on behalf of fellow German taxpayers. The resulting compromise: a win-win for the two leaders. They hope. They got to demonstrate that the famed Franco-German motor of Europe still has some va-va-voom. Mr Macron badly needs to polish his European credentials at home. He already has an eye on his re-election bid and so far the self-styled Mr Europe's attempt at European reform has failed rather spectacularly to take off. Chancellor Merkel, meanwhile, is in her last term of office. She's clocked the headlines predicting the EU's demise in view of the bickering and a lack of EU solidarity during the pandemic. She has her political legacy in mind. Read more Italy and Spain had previously urged their partners in the 27-member bloc, especially the richer countries of northern Europe, to show more solidarity by sharing debt that all EU nations would help to pay off.

"Aya Hachem was taken to hospital where she was pronounced dead a short time later A young woman shot dead near a supermarket was not the intended target, officers have said. Aya Hachem was found with fatal injuries in King Street in Blackburn, close to Lidl, on Sunday. The 19-year-old law student, described as ""truly remarkable"", was going to the shop at about 15:00 BST when she was shot from a passing car, police said. Three men, aged 33, 36, and 39 from Blackburn have been arrested on suspicion of murder and are in custody. A Toyota Avensis, believed to have been used in the killing, was later found abandoned on Wellington Road. A number of occupants were in the car, which has the registration number SV53 UBP, as it passed Ms Hachem, police said. Detectives have urged ""anyone with information to search their consciences and come forward"". ""There is no evidence to suggest Aya was the intended target of this attack and every indication is that she was an innocent passerby,"" the force said. Police believe a Toyota Avensis was used to commit the offence Ms Hachem's parents have paid tribute to the ""most loyal devoted daughter"" who ""dreamed of becoming a solicitor"". ""We are absolutely devastated by her death and would like to take this opportunity to plead with any members of the public who may have any information however small that may bring those responsible to justice,"" they said. Ms Hachem was one of four siblings and lived in Blackburn after travelling to the UK about nine years ago, her cousin Hassan told the BBC. Her family was waiting for the investigation to finish so they could take her body back to Lebanon to be buried in her home village Qlaileh, he said. Ms Hachem, who was a young trustee for the Children's Society, was described as a ""truly remarkable young woman, and an inspiring voice for children and young people"" by its chief executive Mark Russell. Dr Janice Allan, Dean of Salford Business School, said Ms Hachem was ""a very popular and promising second year student whose contribution went beyond the classroom"". The Asylum and Refugee Community, a charity working with asylum seekers and refugees in the Blackburn and Darwen area, said Ms Hachem had been the victim of ""a horrific senseless attack"". ""It is with great sadness and heartache we have to share with you that we have lost Aya, beloved eldest daughter of Samar and Ismael from Lebanon,"" it added. Ms Hachem was found with fatal injuries in King Street at about 15:00 BST on Sunday The family of Yousef Makki, who wasstabbed to death in Hale Barns in 2019,have also paid tribute to the 19-year-old. ""Another act of senseless violence that has ripped apart another family, our hearts and thoughts go out to Aya and her family at this heart-breaking time,"" said the Makki family, who were friends with Ms Hachem's family. Police said the force was not treating the killing as a terror-related incident and also did not believe it was racially-motivated. ""This is a truly shocking and senseless killing, which has robbed a young woman of her life,"" said Det Supt Jonathan Holmes.

Ms Hachem was one of four siblings and lived in Blackburn after travelling to the UK about nine years ago, her cousin Hassan told the BBC. Her family was waiting for the investigation to finish so they could take her body back to Lebanon to be buried in her home village Qlaileh, he said. Ms Hachem, who was a young trustee for the Children's Society, was described as a ""truly remarkable young woman, and an inspiring voice for children and young people"" by its chief executive Mark Russell. Dr Janice Allan, Dean of Salford Business School, said Ms Hachem was ""a very popular and promising second year student whose contribution went beyond the classroom"". The Asylum and Refugee Community, a charity working with asylum seekers and refugees in the Blackburn and Darwen area, said Ms Hachem had been the victim of ""a horrific senseless attack"". ""It is with great sadness and heartache we have to share with you that we have lost Aya, beloved eldest daughter of Samar and Ismael from Lebanon,"" it added. Ms Hachem was found with fatal injuries in King Street at about 15:00 BST on Sunday The family of Yousef Makki, who wasstabbed to death in Hale Barns in 2019,have also paid tribute to the 19-year-old. ""Another act of senseless violence that has ripped apart another family, our hearts and thoughts go out to Aya and her family at this heart-breaking time,"" said the Makki family, who were friends with Ms Hachem's family. Police said the force was not treating the killing as a terror-related incident and also did not believe it was racially-motivated. ""This is a truly shocking and senseless killing, which has robbed a young woman of her life,"" said Det Supt Jonathan Holmes. ""We appreciate this will have caused a lot of worry in the community, but we have deployed significant additional resources, including armed officers, to carry out high-visibility patrols in the area to provide reassurance to residents.""

"Nike said its employees had all now recovered after the Edinburgh outbreak Nicola Sturgeon has hit back at suggestions that a coronavrius outbreak at a conference in Edinburgh in February was covered up. At least 25 people linked to the Nike event may have contracted the virus but people who shared facilities with delegates were not told. The first minister said details were not made public at the time because of patient confidentiality guidelines. But MP Ian Murray accused Ms Surgeon of keeping ""vital information secret"". Disclosure: Scotland's Lockdown BBC Scotland has been told that staff from Lloyds Banking Group were among those who shared facilities with Nike delegates. A total of 20 Lloyds employees were in the same hotel on the same day but were not told about the outbreak and were not offered testing. This comes afterThe Mail on Sunday,externalreported that staff at two other firms fell ill after coming into contact with Nike delegates. The newspaper said the businesses - a marketing firm and a kilt hire company - were not contacted at the time of the outbreak. The conference has been described as Scotland's ""ground zero"", where community transmission first happened. Ms Sturgeon insisted all proper procedures were followed and ""contact tracing was done rigorously in this situation"". Speaking at the daily government briefing on Monday, the first minister said she would ""caution people against latching on to emotive phrases like 'covering things up'"". She added: ""I would simply ask people what on earth would have been the motive for not putting more information into the public domain should it have been possible to do so?"". Earlier Scottish lockdown 'could have prevented 2,000 deaths' Sturgeon defends handling of Edinburgh outbreak Contact tracers 'will be ready' on 1 June But Ms Sturgeon's explanation that patient confidentiality was paramount in this situation is wrong, according to shadow Scottish Secretary Ian Murray. The Edinburgh South MP has written to the first minister to claim the patient confidentiality point is ""unfounded in terms of law and runs counter to the recognition in law of the over-riding public interest"". At least 25 people are known to have contracted the virus after the Nike event at a hotel in Edinburgh Mr Murray says the Public Health (Scotland) Act 2008 supersedes all other considerations if ""it is necessary to do so for the purposes of, or in connection with, the protection of public health"". The Labour MP added: ""The cover-up of this early and significant outbreak has shattered public confidence in the Scottish government. ""Questions are piling up for Nicola Sturgeon about her decision to keep this vital information secret, which we now know had consequences far and wide. ""There is not the slightest doubt that sharing information about the Edinburgh outbreak would have transformed public perceptions, safeguarded my constituents and led nationally to an acceleration of counter-measures."" The Scottish government said all of the Nike cases that were later confirmed were included in the daily totals published and Health Protection Scotland had established an incident management team at the time. Nike told the BBC it had instigated enhanced measures, including contact tracing and increased cleaning and disinfection processes in its stores and offices, after the outbreak at its Edinburgh conference, and said that all of its staff had now recovered.

While it is hard to pinpoint an exact cause for the surge, it seems to have been boosted by an announcement from Moderna that it had seen positive results in eight people given doses in its early vaccine trials.

Greece has had a total of 2,834 cases and 163 deaths from coronavirus Greece has urged the UK to exempt Greeks from a planned quarantine for arrivals to Britain. It would be in return for British people being able to enter Greece. The British government has said it will introduce a 14-day quarantine for all arrivals to the UK with the exception of Ireland from early June. But on Monday the UK transport secretary saidpeople coming from countries with low rates of infectioncould be exempted in the future.

Listenhere  US President Donald Trump has said he is taking hydroxychloroquine in an attempt to ward off coronavirus. Trump has previously touted the malaria drug as a treatment for coronavirus, but there is scant scientific evidence it can fight off Covid-19.

The US coronavirus death toll has passed 90,000, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The US toll now stands 90,312 - the highest of any nation in the world. The UK has reported the second highest death toll with 34,876, followed by Italy with 32,007.

the ban within the next eight days. Tony Blair has spoken to BBC Newsnight about coronavirus and global leadership Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair has said in a BBC interview that it is right to reopen schools. Speaking amid a row about the safety of bringing teachers and children back to the classroom from 1 June, he says he believes the government's approach is based on evidence. ""I donât think they would say that theyâre putting school opening above health risks. What theyâre doing is basing it on the evidence, actually. There are countries that have reopened parts, at least, of their school system. ""If you look at all the best evidence, and my institute has assembled a lot of the different data on this, especially for younger children, the risks of transmission are actually quite low."" Blair, who runs the Tony Blair Institute For Global Change, also said he was shocked by ""the absence of global leadership"" in particular from the US. The West should ""stand together"" in a new relationship with China, he says. ""I think we need a strategic response to China, not simply ad-hoc or reactive response on individual issues or questions."" The full Newsnight interview can be seen at 22.30 BST on BBC Two Western New York is expected to begin reopening on Tuesday, according to New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. The region - which contains Niagara Falls - will join Central New York, Finger Lakes, Mohawk Valley, North County and Southern Tier in phase-one reopening. This means parts of the economy including retail, agriculture, construction and manufacturing may soon start up again. There were 106 coronavirus-related deaths yesterday in New York state, taking the total to more than 28,000. Cuomo also used his press briefing to announce that he wants professional sports teams to start competing again without fans in attendance. ""Hockey, basketball, baseball, football, whoever can reopen. We're a ready, willing and able partner,"" he said. BBC OS We spoke to three new mothers about giving birth and caring for their new child during a pandemic. Here are their stories. Brooke Young Russellis in New York City. She had her son on 12 April, and had to wear a mask while giving birth to him as she was right next to coronavirus patients in the hospital. She was initially told that her partner couldn't be with her for the birth, but then thousands signed a petition to get the hospital to reverse its decision, which it did. ""My mom hasn't met my son yet and that is traumatising for me... my family's absence feels so much stronger now because there's no way that they can be here. The fact that my mother hasn't been able to hold her grandson yet just kills me every time."" Salma Ishaqis in London. She gave birth on 10 March, at 27 weeks. Her baby is in hospital and, before lockdown, she and her husband could visit the neonatal unit 24 hours a day. ""When the lockdown came in, the hospital policies changed. In the unit I'm in, dads are not able to visit at all and mums only for two hours. ""Twice he's had to be resuscitated and having to go in by yourself, without your husband being allowed, and going and seeing your baby in an incubator, having the ventilator... I'd kind of gone into this survival mode. Now that it's been two months I've started to process it a bit more."" Vicky Kavanaghis in Dublin, and gave birth in January. ""We live very near to my in-laws and we're very lucky - they're very involved in our lives. They were able to spend a bit of time with their granddaughter before everything kicked in."" ""I always think of all the things she's missing out on. The closeness she should have had with her grandparents. ""There's this whole chapter of her life that only me and her father have witnessed and it's been very isolating for the three of us going through that."" You can listen to the full story here. South Sudan's Vice President Riek Machar and his wife Angelina Teny, the country's defence minister, have tested positive for coronavirus. Machar, who is in his late 60s, was tested on 13 May after one of the members of the government 's Covid-19 task force tested positive. He says he has no symptoms and will self-isolate for the next 14 days. A number of Macharâs bodyguards and staff have also been found positive.

Ray McDermott, 96, is originally from Carmarthenshire, Wales, but she has  lived in the US for 70 years. She worried she would never speak Welsh again after her mother died four decades ago. ""I don't think I'll ever have a chance to speak Welsh again,"" she recently told her son Keith. Worried about his mum's loneliness and memory-loss, Keith put out a call on social media for Welsh speakers. Within 30 minutes, he was deluged with responses. One of those who responded was Melisa Annis - a director and playwright originally from Cardiff but living in New York. She gave Ray a call. ""It's a very hard time at the moment and we are all feeling a little bit isolated and especially if you are older. I thought, 'Why not reach out?' I am a fluent Welsh speaker and very pro the Welsh language,"" Melisa said. Ray's first words in Welsh, after 40 years, were: ""I used to talk in Welsh with my mum."" Read the full story here. In Rome, Italy, a limit on the number of people allowed on trains have been introduced With lockdowns easing across much of Europe and the US, and some sectors returning to work, you might be wondering how safe  public transport is. Many cities are urging commuters to cycle or walk instead of catching a bus or train, but in some cases, there is no other option. A lot of the potential risk of infection on trains and buses depends on how crowded they are, and how far away you can keep from other people. Ventilation also plays an important role as fresh air can help droplets containing the virus dissipate faster. In the UK, the advice for people taking public transport incudes: Read more about the infection risks on public transport.

Work on a coronavirus vaccine has been taking place at unprecedented speed Earlier we reported about a promising early trial for a Covid-19 vaccine produced by Moderna Inc. Share prices in the US pharmaceutical company have shot up. Now, here's some more information about what the vaccine trials have found. In the first eight people who took part in Moderna Inc's trials, antibodies were found that can neutralise coronavirus. Even people taking the lowest dose of the trial vaccine produced antibodies at the same levels seen in patients who recover from Covid-19. But there is still some way to go. Testing for these neutralising antibodies has only taken place on the first eight, out of 45, people on the trial. And it will take larger trials to see if people are protected against the virus. Our Health Correspondent James Gallagher has been delving more deeply into this development. Read more here.  Have you heard the one about the priest who set up a drive-through holy water shooting gallery? Father Tim Pelc, of St Ambrose Parish in Michigan, became a hit online after he came up with a novel solution to blessing church-goers during the coronavirus pandemic. ""You can't double dip into the holy water container,"" he told Today in the US. ""I thought, what could I do that would keep the quarantine restrictions going and give kids the experience of Easter?"" He fired the holy weapon at Easter, but a tweet showing this social distancing solution has now been liked more than 570,000 times. It has even inspired parody art, such as the following effort from Redditor Tomdoerr88: A man desperate to hug his grandmother while protecting her from possible infection has come up with what has been dubbed the ""cuddle curtain"". Footage of the pair enjoying a long-awaited hug has been viewed millions of times on social media. Based on a plastic shower curtain and featuring disposable gloves, it was created by Antony Cauvin, from Stratford-upon-Avon in England. He said he had been thinking about the problem for some time. Despite the easing of some lockdown measures in England, the government is still asking people to avoid meeting up with more than one person at a time from a different household and to maintain a gap of at least two metres at all times.

The latest job cuts come after plans to cut 3,700 jobs were announced earlier this month, meaning around a quarter of the company's jobs will be lost. The workforce cuts do not include drivers, whom Uber considers independent contractors. Uber said it would reorganise its remaining staff and cut back spending in areas that are not part of its core personal transport or food delivery businesses, including its AI Labs. The number of Uber rides dropped 80% around the world last month as the company was hit by coronavirus restrictions. Â© 2025 BBC.

""I don't think I'll ever have a chance to speak Welsh again,"" she recently told her son Keith. Worried about his mum's loneliness and memory-loss, Keith put out a call on social media for Welsh speakers. Within 30 minutes, he was deluged with responses. One of those who responded was Melisa Annis - a director and playwright originally from Cardiff but living in New York. She gave Ray a call. ""It's a very hard time at the moment and we are all feeling a little bit isolated and especially if you are older. I thought, 'Why not reach out?' I am a fluent Welsh speaker and very pro the Welsh language,"" Melisa said. Ray's first words in Welsh, after 40 years, were: ""I used to talk in Welsh with my mum."" Read the full story here. In Rome, Italy, a limit on the number of people allowed on trains have been introduced With lockdowns easing across much of Europe and the US, and some sectors returning to work, you might be wondering how safe  public transport is. Many cities are urging commuters to cycle or walk instead of catching a bus or train, but in some cases, there is no other option. A lot of the potential risk of infection on trains and buses depends on how crowded they are, and how far away you can keep from other people. Ventilation also plays an important role as fresh air can help droplets containing the virus dissipate faster. In the UK, the advice for people taking public transport incudes: Read more about the infection risks on public transport.

Work on a coronavirus vaccine has been taking place at unprecedented speed Earlier we reported about a promising early trial for a Covid-19 vaccine produced by Moderna Inc. Share prices in the US pharmaceutical company have shot up. Now, here's some more information about what the vaccine trials have found. In the first eight people who took part in Moderna Inc's trials, antibodies were found that can neutralise coronavirus. Even people taking the lowest dose of the trial vaccine produced antibodies at the same levels seen in patients who recover from Covid-19. But there is still some way to go. Testing for these neutralising antibodies has only taken place on the first eight, out of 45, people on the trial. And it will take larger trials to see if people are protected against the virus. Our Health Correspondent James Gallagher has been delving more deeply into this development. Read more here.  Have you heard the one about the priest who set up a drive-through holy water shooting gallery? Father Tim Pelc, of St Ambrose Parish in Michigan, became a hit online after he came up with a novel solution to blessing church-goers during the coronavirus pandemic. ""You can't double dip into the holy water container,"" he told Today in the US. ""I thought, what could I do that would keep the quarantine restrictions going and give kids the experience of Easter?"" He fired the holy weapon at Easter, but a tweet showing this social distancing solution has now been liked more than 570,000 times. It has even inspired parody art, such as the following effort from Redditor Tomdoerr88: A man desperate to hug his grandmother while protecting her from possible infection has come up with what has been dubbed the ""cuddle curtain"". Footage of the pair enjoying a long-awaited hug has been viewed millions of times on social media. Based on a plastic shower curtain and featuring disposable gloves, it was created by Antony Cauvin, from Stratford-upon-Avon in England. He said he had been thinking about the problem for some time. Despite the easing of some lockdown measures in England, the government is still asking people to avoid meeting up with more than one person at a time from a different household and to maintain a gap of at least two metres at all times.

The latest job cuts come after plans to cut 3,700 jobs were announced earlier this month, meaning around a quarter of the company's jobs will be lost. The workforce cuts do not include drivers, whom Uber considers independent contractors. Uber said it would reorganise its remaining staff and cut back spending in areas that are not part of its core personal transport or food delivery businesses, including its AI Labs. The number of Uber rides dropped 80% around the world last month as the company was hit by coronavirus restrictions. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Groups of up to six people who do not share a household in Northern Ireland will be allowed to meet outdoors, the executive has said. Ministers have agreed to ease more lockdown restrictions as part of the first step of their recovery plan, so long as social distancing is followed. Garden centres and recycling centreshave already been allowed to reopen. Churches and places of worship can open for private prayer and some sports, such as golf and tennis, can restart. Other outdoor activities that do not involve shared contact with hard surfaces, including some water sports, will be permitted,  as more and public sports venues and outdoors spaces can reopen. The Golfing Union of Ireland has said golf will return in Northern Ireland on Wednesday. Drive-in church services and drive-in cinemas, as well as drive-in concerts, will also be permitted. First Minister Arlene Foster said the executive did not agree to allow people to visit immediate family indoors, where social distancing is possible, even though it is included in step one of the Pathway to Recovery plan. Arlene Foster said the executive was considering the issue of small weddings and hoped a decision could be made soon She said she understood that would be disappointing for some people, but she gave a ""commitment"" to keep the restriction under constant review. ""We would have liked to unlock the whole of step one but, quite simply, the reason why we haven't been able to move to indoor family gatherings is because of the medical advice,"" said Mrs Foster. How do lockdown rules differ in Northern Ireland? ""The relaxations we've announced have been made made possible by the vast majority of you following advice. ""They have been hard-won freedoms and it's vital when you exercise them, it doesn't put anyone else's safety at risk."" On Monday, the Department of Healthannounced six more Covid-19 related deaths,externalin Northern Ireland, bringing its total to 482. A separate weekly report from the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (Nisra) showed that599 deaths had been recorded, up to 8 May, in total, because its figures record all fatalities where coronavirus is mentioned on a death certificate. ""Bear with us,"" urged Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill, who said as soon as the advice changed, the executive would move to lift the restriction on visiting family indoors. In other developments on Monday: Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill says the executive has agreed to establish a graduate medical school at Ulster University's Magee campus in Londonderry, to open by 2021 Contact tracing of people in Northern Ireland who have tested positive for Covid-19 is to be rolled out, says First Minister Arlene Foster Loss of smell or tastehave been added to the UK's listof coronavirus symptoms that people should look out for and self-isolate with Health Minister Robin Swann says testing would bemade available to all care home staff and residentsby June, but his department says it will be another two weeks before we get detail around when care home staff will be tested A new Â£40m Stormont grants scheme has beencriticised for excluding sole tradersand some social enterprises ""We will get there and we'll get there sooner, if we all keep doing what we're doing,"" she added. Last week, the executive publishedits five-phase blueprint for recoveryin Northern Ireland, but it did not have a timetable. The lockdown remains in place with a review due by 28 May, but some aspects of the first stage of the executive's plan were allowed to begin on Monday morning. Drive-through church services will now be allowed, in line with social distancing and public hygiene guidelines There were lengthy queues at some recycling centres that reopened, with Derry City and Strabane District Council appealing, via social media, for people to put their journey off until later in the day. Marriage ceremonies where a person is terminally ill are also allowed. Mrs Foster said the executive is considering the issue of small weddings and that she hoped the executive could make a decision on that ""in the very near future"". She also said the decision to reopen religious venues for prayer, and golf courses, had been deemed ""sufficiently low-risk"". ""Golf clubs will be relieved players will be returning to their fairways,"" said the first minister. Ms O'Neill said there would be ""no restrictions on travelling"" for any of these activities, but stressed that people availing of any services must use common sense as keeping at least 2m apart from non-household members still applies. The Bishop of Derry, Donal McKeown, toldBBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extraprogramme that he welcomed the decision to allow people to access spaces for personal prayer. He said churches were taking many steps to ensure priests complied with health and safety guidelines, including installing CCTV cameras. ""It's important for people who've been bottled up for the past eight weeks to have a chance to talk to a priest, and ensure people can pray quietly should they wish to unburden themselves,"" he added. Read in full: NI Executive's Pathway to Recovery On Monday, garden centres and recycling centres were allowed to reopen, with lengthy queues developing at some sites. Some recycling centres, which are managed by Northern Ireland's 11 councils, had already put safety measures in place and reopened ahead of the executive's announcement last week.

"Mr Gaiman left his wife Amanda Palmer and son behind in Auckland Police have spoken to author Neil Gaiman after he admitted breaking Scotland's lockdown rules by travelling 11,000 miles from New Zealand to Skye. The Good Omens and American Gods writer left his wife and son in Auckland so he could""isolate"" at his island retreat. He wrote on his online blog: ""Hullo from Scotland, where I am in rural lockown on my own."" Police Scotland said officers had visited Mr Gaiman at his holiday home on Skye. Insp Linda Allan said the officers spoke to the author ""about his actions"". She said: ""He has been given suitable advice about essential travel and reminded about the current guidelines in Scotland."" The science fiction and fantasy author has been criticised for ""endangering"" local people"". The SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford, who is the MP for the island, toldthe Sunday Times,externalthe author's journey was unacceptable. He said: ""What is it about people, when they know we are in the middle of lockdown that they think they can come here from the other side of the planet, in turn endangering local people from exposure to this infection that they could have picked up at any step of the way?"" Kate Forbes, SNP MSP for Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch, also criticised the writer's actions. She said: ""The remarkable thing is that he posted a blog post about his travel to Skye - evidently oblivious to local residents' concerns and outrage about people breaking lockdown and putting their community at risk. ""The Highlands does not exist for anybody's personal self-isolation needs."" Mr Gaiman - whose main family home is in Woodstock in the USA - has owned the house on Skye for more than 10 years. The English-born author wroteon his blog,externalthat until two weeks ago he had been living in New Zealand with his wife, the singer Amanda Palmer, and their four-year-old son. He said the couple agreed ""that we needed to give each other some space"". The 59-year-old said he flew ""masked and gloved, from empty Auckland airport"" to Los Angeles. He then caught a British Airways flight to London before borrowing a friend's car and heading for Skye. ""I drove north, on empty motorways and then on empty roads, and got in about midnight, and I've been here ever since,"" he said. ""I needed to be somewhere I could talk to people in the UK while they and I were awake, not just before breakfast and after dinner. And I needed to be somewhere I could continue to isolate easily. ""It's rough for almost everyone right now - some people are crammed together and wish they weren't, some are alone and crave companionship, pretty much all of us are hurting in one way or another. So be kind."" Mr Gaiman, whose best known works include American Gods, Good Omens and the children's novel Coraline, has described Skye as his favourite place in the world and the best place for him to write.

"Germany's Angela Merkel and France's Emmanuel Macron discussed the fund via video link France and Germany are proposing a â¬500bn ($545bn; Â£448bn) European recovery fund to be distributed to EU countries worst affected by Covid-19. In talks on Monday, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel agreed that the funds should be provided as grants. The proposal represents a significant shift in Mrs Merkel's position. Mr Macron said it was a major step forward and was ""what the eurozone needs to remain united"". ""I believe this is a very deep transformation and that's what the European Union and the single market needed to remain coherent,"" Mr Macron said following discussions via video link. Mrs Merkel, who had previously rejected the idea of nations sharing debt, said the European Commission would raise money for the fund by borrowing on the markets, which would be repaid gradually from the EU's overall budget. Grants provided by the proposed recovery fund should also be used to help finance the bloc's investment in a greener future, the two leaders said. Politics and PR: Behind the scenes of the plan Spain set for basic income to ease crisis pain Coronavirus 'could cost global economy $8.8tn' European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the proposal ""acknowledges the scope and the size of the economic challenge that Europe faces"". European Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde said the plan was ""ambitious, targeted and welcome"". Other EU countries must agree with the proposal, however, and Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz later insisted that his country backed providing loans to member nations hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, rather than grants. ""Our position remains unchanged,"" Mr Kurz wrote in a tweet, adding: ""We expect the updated [EU budget] to reflect the new priorities rather than raising the ceiling."" In EU political terms this is huge. Chancellor Merkel has conceded a lot. She openly agreed with the French that any money from this fund, allocated to a needy EU country, should be a grant, not a loan. Importantly, this means not increasing the debts of economies already weak before the pandemic. President Macron gave ground, too. He had wanted a huge fund of a trillion or more euros. But a trillion euros of grants was probably too much for Mrs Merkel to swallow on behalf of fellow German taxpayers. The resulting compromise: a win-win for the two leaders. They hope. They got to demonstrate that the famed Franco-German motor of Europe still has some va-va-voom. Mr Macron badly needs to polish his European credentials at home. He already has an eye on his re-election bid and so far the self-styled Mr Europe's attempt at European reform has failed rather spectacularly to take off. Chancellor Merkel, meanwhile, is in her last term of office. She's clocked the headlines predicting the EU's demise in view of the bickering and a lack of EU solidarity during the pandemic. She has her political legacy in mind. Read more Italy and Spain had previously urged their partners in the 27-member bloc, especially the richer countries of northern Europe, to show more solidarity by sharing debt that all EU nations would help to pay off.

"The owner of High Street restaurant chains Cafe Rouge and Bella Italia has filed intent to appoint administrators at the High Court. Owner Casual Dining Group, whose brands also include the Las Iguanas chain, employs about 6,000 people. The company said the move would give it ten days' breathing space to consider ""all options"" for restructuring. Restaurants have been hit hard after shutting their doors in March as part of Britain's virus lockdown. Earlier on Monday, Casual Dining Group said that it is working with advisers from corporate finance firm AlixPartners over a potential restructuring programme. A Casual Dining Group spokeswoman said: ""As is widely acknowledged, this is an unprecedented situation for our industry and, like many other companies across the UK, the directors of Casual Dining Group are working closely with our advisers as we consider our next steps. ""These notifications are a prudent measure in light of the company's position and the wider situation."" The firm said the move would protect it from any threatened legal action from landlords. The notice of intent to appoint administrators gives the firm ten days to put a restructuring plan into place. After that ten days is up, the firm could let the notice lapse, if there is a viable restructuring  plan. But if there is no feasible restructuring plan, the firm must either ask for another ten days to come up with one, or it could appoint administrators for the business. The restructuring plan could involve so-called ""company voluntary arrangements"" (CVAs), which allow a firm to keep trading while reducing rents. It could also see one or more of the firm's brands put into administration. The UK's casual dining chains had a tough few years even before the coronavirus pandemic arrived. Many struggled with a raft of increasing costs, including upwards-only rent reviews, business rates, a rising minimum wage and the apprenticeship levy. A rise in the cost of imported food following the sharp drop in the value of the pound amid Brexit uncertainty was another pressure point. Some well-known names, including Jamie Oliver'srestaurant empire, the burger chain Byron, and theChiquito and Frankie & Benny's ownerhave either closed sites or had to put in place emergency financial measures.

"Aya Hachem was taken to hospital where she was pronounced dead a short time later A young woman shot dead near a supermarket was not the intended target, officers have said. Aya Hachem was found with fatal injuries in King Street in Blackburn, close to Lidl, on Sunday. The 19-year-old law student, described as ""truly remarkable"", was going to the shop at about 15:00 BST when she was shot from a passing car, police said. Three men, aged 33, 36, and 39 from Blackburn have been arrested on suspicion of murder and are in custody. A Toyota Avensis, believed to have been used in the killing, was later found abandoned on Wellington Road. A number of occupants were in the car, which has the registration number SV53 UBP, as it passed Ms Hachem, police said. Detectives have urged ""anyone with information to search their consciences and come forward"". ""There is no evidence to suggest Aya was the intended target of this attack and every indication is that she was an innocent passerby,"" the force said. Police believe a Toyota Avensis was used to commit the offence Ms Hachem's parents have paid tribute to the ""most loyal devoted daughter"" who ""dreamed of becoming a solicitor"". ""We are absolutely devastated by her death and would like to take this opportunity to plead with any members of the public who may have any information however small that may bring those responsible to justice,"" they said. Ms Hachem was one of four siblings and lived in Blackburn after travelling to the UK about nine years ago, her cousin Hassan told the BBC. Her family was waiting for the investigation to finish so they could take her body back to Lebanon to be buried in her home village Qlaileh, he said. Ms Hachem, who was a young trustee for the Children's Society, was described as a ""truly remarkable young woman, and an inspiring voice for children and young people"" by its chief executive Mark Russell. Dr Janice Allan, Dean of Salford Business School, said Ms Hachem was ""a very popular and promising second year student whose contribution went beyond the classroom"". The Asylum and Refugee Community, a charity working with asylum seekers and refugees in the Blackburn and Darwen area, said Ms Hachem had been the victim of ""a horrific senseless attack"". ""It is with great sadness and heartache we have to share with you that we have lost Aya, beloved eldest daughter of Samar and Ismael from Lebanon,"" it added. Ms Hachem was found with fatal injuries in King Street at about 15:00 BST on Sunday The family of Yousef Makki, who wasstabbed to death in Hale Barns in 2019,have also paid tribute to the 19-year-old. ""Another act of senseless violence that has ripped apart another family, our hearts and thoughts go out to Aya and her family at this heart-breaking time,"" said the Makki family, who were friends with Ms Hachem's family. Police said the force was not treating the killing as a terror-related incident and also did not believe it was racially-motivated. ""This is a truly shocking and senseless killing, which has robbed a young woman of her life,"" said Det Supt Jonathan Holmes. ""We appreciate this will have caused a lot of worry in the community, but we have deployed significant additional resources, including armed officers, to carry out high-visibility patrols in the area to provide reassurance to residents.""

"This video can not be played Trump: ""If it's not good, I'll tell you right, I'm not going to get hurt by it"" US President Donald Trump has said he is taking hydroxychloroquine to ward off coronavirus, despite public health officials warning it may be unsafe. Speaking at the White House, he told reporters he started taking the malaria and lupus medication recently. ""I'm taking it for about a week and a half now and I'm still here, I'm still here,"" was his surprise announcement. There is no evidence hydroxychloroquine can fight coronavirus, and regulators warn the drug may cause heart problems. Dr Marcos Espinal, director of the Pan American Health Organization - part of the World Health Organization (WHO) - has also since stressed that no clinical trials have recommended the use of hydroxychloroquine for coronavirus. The 73-year-old president was hosting a meeting devoted to the struggling restaurant industry on Monday, when he caught reporters unawares by revealing he was taking the drug. ""You'd be surprised at how many people are taking it, especially the frontline workers before you catch it, the frontline workers, many, many are taking it,"" he told reporters. ""I happen to be taking it."" Asked what was his evidence of hydroxychloroquine's positive benefits, Mr Trump said: ""Here's my evidence: I get a lot of positive calls about it."" What's known about anti-malarial drugs and Covid-19? The unproven 'corona drug' US is threatening India for Coronavirus: Where are cases still rising? He added: ""I've heard a lot of good stories [about hydroxychloroquine] and if it's not good, I'll tell you right I'm not going to get hurt by it."" Though some people in the White House have tested positive for coronavirus, the president said again on Monday he had ""zero symptoms"" and was being tested frequently. He added that he had been taking a daily zinc supplement and received a single dose of azithromycin, an antibiotic meant to prevent infection. When asked whether the White House physician had recommended he start taking the disputed remedy, Mr Trump said he himself had requested it. Dr Sean Conley, physician to the president, said in a statement issued through the White House later on Monday that Mr Trump was in ""very good health"" and ""symptom-free"". The US Navy officer added: ""After numerous discussions he and I had regarding the evidence for and against the use of hydroxychloroquine, we concluded the potential benefit from treatment outweighed the relative risks."" The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) last month issued an advisory saying that hydroxychloroquine has ""not been shown to be safe and effective"". It cited reports that the drug can cause serious heart rhythm problems in Covid-19 patients. The FDA warned against use of the medication outside hospitals, where the agency has granted temporary authorisation for its use in some cases. Clinical trials of the drug are also under way. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) says there are no approved drugs or therapeutics to prevent or treat Covid-19, which is confirmed to have infected more than 1.5 million people in the US, killing more than 90,000 patients. I'll have what President Trump's having. No thanks - or rather, not yet. Currently there is no convincing evidence that hydroxychloroquine helps fight the virus and it can cause unpleasant and harmful side effects in some people. In theory, repurposing existing drugs to treat coronavirus is a very good and sound idea (unlike Mr Trump's previous ones about injecting disinfectant or hitting the body with ""tremendous"" UV light). It may be our only hope, at least in the short term, until a vaccine can be found. The UK government has been stockpiling some medicines that might be useful against coronavirus.That includes 16m hydroxychloroquine tablets,external. Clinical trials are under way in the UK and the US to assess the drug's worth. The human guinea pigs taking part include frontline healthcare workers at high risk of exposure to the virus, as well as patients. Experts agree that this work is worth doing, but they are concerned about advocating more general use of these experimental treatments before the proof is in. Dr Stephen Griffin, associate professor at the School of Medicine at the University of Leeds, told me: ""People that follow the president's example might not only endanger themselves but could also deprive patients with chronic autoimmune conditions of their much-needed medication."" Dismissing reports of severe side effects from hydroxychloroquine, the president said: ""All I can tell you is, so far I seem to be OK."" He said the ""only negative"" he had heard was from a ""very unscientific report"" conducted by ""people that aren't big Trump fans"". Mr Trump was apparently referring to a preliminary study from April of Covid-19 patients in US government-run hospitals for military veterans that suggested hydroxychloroquine had no benefit and may have even caused a greater rate of deaths. ""I get a lot of tremendously positive news on the hydroxy,"" the president told reporters, adding: ""What do you have to lose?"" According to doctors, the drug has the potential to cause symptoms including heart failure, suicidal thoughts and signs of liver disease. This video can not be played What's it like to fast for Ramadan as a healthcare worker during the pandemic? Mr Trump's most powerful elected antagonist, the Democratic Speaker of the US House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, could not resist taking a dig at his age and weight when asked on CNN about him taking the malaria medication. ""He's our president and I would rather he not be taking something that has not been approved by the scientists, especially in his age group and in his, shall we say, weight group - morbidly obese, they say,"" she said. Last year, the White House physician noted in Mr Trump's annual medical exam that he weighed 243lb (110kg) and was 6ft 3in, which would score his body mass index at a technically obese 30.4. Senate Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called Mr Trump's decision ""reckless"" but added: ""Who knows if it's true?"" ""He may not have been taking it for all we know. He just likes to make a splash,"" he told MSNBC. ""Maybe he's really not taking it,"" he continued, ""because the president lies about things characteristically-like.""

"Electric bikes can slash transport emissions and offer workers a way to return to the workplace during coronavirus, a new study has found. If e-bikes took off in the same way in the UK, as in many European cities, it would reduce congestion, improve mobility, and save CO2, the study says. It said the UK government hadnât yet realised the strategic importance of e-bikes, push-bikes with electric motors. The greatest impact would be in areas with poor public transport, it found. That's because a wider range of people would be able to use e-bikes, it said. The research comes from the publicly funded Centre for Research into Energy Demand Solutions (Creds), based in Oxford. The researchers say that in Denmark, where cycling has been strongly encouraged for decades, e-bike routes are already linking cities to towns and villages. The research comes at a time when ministers aredesperate for solutions which allow people to get to work without risking their health on public transport, but also without increasing carbon emissions. So far the main emphasis has been on bringing people into city centres, wherepopup cycle lanes are being introduced. But the Creds paper says e-bikes can be particularly effective in economically-deprived areas where people canât afford cars, but bus services are poor. This could be in suburban or semi-rural areas. It says the UK government should find ways to incentivise the use of e-bikes. Climate change: Could the coronavirus crisis spur a green recovery? How coronavirus is driving a revolution in travel Professor Nick Eyre from Creds told BBC News: ""E-bikes give us an exciting new opportunity to reduce energy use and carbon emissions. âThey need to be part of the plan for the major investment we need in transport to get people moving safely again in ways that are economically and environmentally sustainable."" Critics could say that creating a major network of e-bike lanes would be expensive and sometimes not feasible. There will also be problems with bike theft â and of culture in places where there is little history of cycling. Professor Eyre said: âWe know cycling is culturally dependent. Thereâs much more cycling here in Oxford than in Leeds, for example. ""Itâs partly because Leeds is bigger and hillier, but itâs partly because in Oxford cycling is just something we do. â[But] the last few weeks have shown us thereâs much more capacity for people to change than we previously thought.â Some planners believe the UK is on the brink of an urban transport revolution. The government is currently consulting the public on the use of electric scooters on Britainâs streets. However, a wide range of organisations, from pedestrians to motorists, have expressed their fears about the potential dangers of e-scooters, whether on the pavement or on the road.

"Students applying for university places in England must be told with ""absolute clarity"" how courses will be taught - before they make choices for the autumn, says the university watchdog. Courses might still be online - and Nicola Dandridge of the Office for Students warned against misleading promises about a ""campus experience"". University campuses have been closed this term by the Covid-19 outbreak. But universities can charge full fees even if courses are taught online. ""The important thing here is absolute clarity to students, so they know what they're getting in advance of accepting offers,"" Ms Dandridge told MPs on the education select committee. ""What we don't want to see are promises that it's all going to be back to usual - an on-campus experience - when it turns out that's not the case,"" said the chief executive of the Office for Student (OFS). More than 300,000 sign petition calling for refund on tuition fees Students will have to pay full fees for online courses, says minister Universities warn of going bust without a bail-out Students angry at rent being charged on empty rooms The OFS says this information should be provided for students before they make a firm choice in June - and ""certainly before"" the clearing process that follows students getting their A-level grades in August. If universities have to update plans after students have made a decision, the OFS says universities should release students from any acceptances and allow them to ""change their minds"". Applicants this year will be waiting to see whether courses will be taught by distance learning or on campus, or a combination of both - and whether they will have accommodation, which might be limited by social distancing. Ms Dandridge told MPs that before students make decisions they need to know ""what they are getting"". She suggested a likely outcome would be ""much greater and more sophisticated use of blended learning so that's face-to-face plus online,"" she said - and that it must not only be ""bunging lectures online"". Universities Minister Michelle Donelan has already said that even if their courses are only taught online, students would still be liable for the same full tuition fee as those being taught in-person. The University of Manchester has said that its lectures will be online next term - but it wanted to allow small group teaching as soon as safely possible. Other universities are considering a delay to the start of the autumn term - and there have been suggestions that some more ""hands-on"" courses will be taught first on campus while others might remain online. Universities are facing their own cash problems from an anticipated reduction in the number of overseas students. Debra Humphris, chair of the University Alliance group of universities, said the scale of the financial challenge would not really be clear until the end of the autumn admissions process. She said support from the government would bring forward existing money to help with cashflow, but ""it's not additional funding"". Jo Grady, leader of the UCU lecturers' union, told MPs there needed to be clear guidance from the government on how and when universities should reopen buildings in the autumn - and not to leave decision to institutions in competition with each other. She warned that financial pressure could mean ""some universities will rush to re-open"". ""They will want to promise students that they will be re-opening next semester in order to attract those students, rather than have them go somewhere else"". Dr Grady said that university campuses would not be easy places for social distancing - and that lecture halls would bring together ""two or three hundred people"". ""Students go from cafes to libraries to restaurants - everywhere is always rammed,"" she said. A spokeswoman for Universities UK said universities were ""already preparing for a range of scenarios - including periods of online study in the academic year 2020-21"".

"The owner of High Street restaurant chains Cafe Rouge and Bella Italia has filed intent to appoint administrators at the High Court. Owner Casual Dining Group, whose brands also include the Las Iguanas chain, employs about 6,000 people. The company said the move would give it ten days' breathing space to consider ""all options"" for restructuring. Restaurants have been hit hard after shutting their doors in March as part of Britain's virus lockdown. Earlier on Monday, Casual Dining Group said that it is working with advisers from corporate finance firm AlixPartners over a potential restructuring programme. A Casual Dining Group spokeswoman said: ""As is widely acknowledged, this is an unprecedented situation for our industry and, like many other companies across the UK, the directors of Casual Dining Group are working closely with our advisers as we consider our next steps. ""These notifications are a prudent measure in light of the company's position and the wider situation."" The firm said the move would protect it from any threatened legal action from landlords. The notice of intent to appoint administrators gives the firm ten days to put a restructuring plan into place. After that ten days is up, the firm could let the notice lapse, if there is a viable restructuring  plan. But if there is no feasible restructuring plan, the firm must either ask for another ten days to come up with one, or it could appoint administrators for the business. The restructuring plan could involve so-called ""company voluntary arrangements"" (CVAs), which allow a firm to keep trading while reducing rents. It could also see one or more of the firm's brands put into administration. The UK's casual dining chains had a tough few years even before the coronavirus pandemic arrived. Many struggled with a raft of increasing costs, including upwards-only rent reviews, business rates, a rising minimum wage and the apprenticeship levy. A rise in the cost of imported food following the sharp drop in the value of the pound amid Brexit uncertainty was another pressure point. Some well-known names, including Jamie Oliver'srestaurant empire, the burger chain Byron, and theChiquito and Frankie & Benny's ownerhave either closed sites or had to put in place emergency financial measures.

He said the department had been working with HM Revenue and Customs, which administers tax credits, to encourage people to check their eligibility before making a claim and ""ensure that tax credit claimants understand that when they have claimed UC, their tax credits will end, and they cannot return to legacy benefits"". In a few, very narrow, situations, such as people with severe disabilities, a tax credit claim can be made again. LOCKDOWN UPDATE:What's changing, where?

"Aya Hachem was taken to hospital where she was pronounced dead a short time later A young woman shot dead near a supermarket was not the intended target, officers have said. Aya Hachem was found with fatal injuries in King Street in Blackburn, close to Lidl, on Sunday. The 19-year-old law student, described as ""truly remarkable"", was going to the shop at about 15:00 BST when she was shot from a passing car, police said. Three men, aged 33, 36, and 39 from Blackburn have been arrested on suspicion of murder and are in custody. A Toyota Avensis, believed to have been used in the killing, was later found abandoned on Wellington Road. A number of occupants were in the car, which has the registration number SV53 UBP, as it passed Ms Hachem, police said. Detectives have urged ""anyone with information to search their consciences and come forward"". ""There is no evidence to suggest Aya was the intended target of this attack and every indication is that she was an innocent passerby,"" the force said. Police believe a Toyota Avensis was used to commit the offence Ms Hachem's parents have paid tribute to the ""most loyal devoted daughter"" who ""dreamed of becoming a solicitor"". ""We are absolutely devastated by her death and would like to take this opportunity to plead with any members of the public who may have any information however small that may bring those responsible to justice,"" they said. Ms Hachem was one of four siblings and lived in Blackburn after travelling to the UK about nine years ago, her cousin Hassan told the BBC. Her family was waiting for the investigation to finish so they could take her body back to Lebanon to be buried in her home village Qlaileh, he said. Ms Hachem, who was a young trustee for the Children's Society, was described as a ""truly remarkable young woman, and an inspiring voice for children and young people"" by its chief executive Mark Russell. Dr Janice Allan, Dean of Salford Business School, said Ms Hachem was ""a very popular and promising second year student whose contribution went beyond the classroom"". The Asylum and Refugee Community, a charity working with asylum seekers and refugees in the Blackburn and Darwen area, said Ms Hachem had been the victim of ""a horrific senseless attack"". ""It is with great sadness and heartache we have to share with you that we have lost Aya, beloved eldest daughter of Samar and Ismael from Lebanon,"" it added. Ms Hachem was found with fatal injuries in King Street at about 15:00 BST on Sunday The family of Yousef Makki, who wasstabbed to death in Hale Barns in 2019,have also paid tribute to the 19-year-old. ""Another act of senseless violence that has ripped apart another family, our hearts and thoughts go out to Aya and her family at this heart-breaking time,"" said the Makki family, who were friends with Ms Hachem's family. Police said the force was not treating the killing as a terror-related incident and also did not believe it was racially-motivated. ""This is a truly shocking and senseless killing, which has robbed a young woman of her life,"" said Det Supt Jonathan Holmes. ""We appreciate this will have caused a lot of worry in the community, but we have deployed significant additional resources, including armed officers, to carry out high-visibility patrols in the area to provide reassurance to residents.""

"This video can not be played Sir Frederick Barclay's nephew is allegedly seen handling a bugging device at London's Ritz hotel CCTV footage allegedly showing Sir Frederick Barclay's nephew handling a bugging device at London's Ritz hotel has been released. The footage is at the centre of a bitter legal row between the families of the billionaire Barclay twins. Sir Frederick, 85, and his daughter Amanda are suing three of Sir David Barclay's sons for invasion of privacy. They claim the surveillance gave the men commercial advantage and they sold the Ritz for half its market value. The Barclay brothers' businesses include the Telegraph Media Group, the online retailer Very Group, the delivery business Yodel, and - at the time of the bugging - the Ritz hotel in London. Who are the Barclay brothers? Telegraph owners to put paper up for sale Sir Frederick, the elder twin by 10 minutes, and his daughter Amanda are suing Sir David Barclay's sons - Alistair, Aidan and Howard, Aidan's son Andrew, and Philip Peters, a board director of the Barclay group for invasion of privacy, breach of confidence and data protection laws. The claim stems from a falling out between the children of the famously private twins. Sir David Barclay and his twin brother Sir Frederick collecting their knighthoods in 2000 Substantial parts of the brothers' empire are now owned by trusts in which their children are beneficiaries. That means Sir David's three sons exercise a controlling interest as compared with Sir Frederick's daughter Amanda. The CCTV footage allegedly shows Alistair Barclay handling a bugging device at the Ritz hotel on 13 January this year. The recording shows Mr Barclay inserting a plug adaptor, which is claimed to contain a listening device, into a socket. In court documents lodged by Sir Frederick and Amanda Barclay, it is claimed the bug - which was placed in the hotel's conservatory where Sir Frederick liked to conduct business meetings and smoke cigars - captured more than 1,000 separate conversations amounting to some 94 hours of recordings Amanda Barclay, pictured with dancer Anton du Beke in 2009 The pair claim the recordings amount to ""commercial espionage on a vast scale"". Last week the high court declined to order the release of the footage to the media in part because ""the material is in the hands of the claimants, and available to them to provide to the media, if they so choose"". The CCTV footage has now been released by Sir Frederick. In a statement he said: ""The decision to release this video of this deliberate and premeditated invasion of my privacy is in the public interest. ""I do not want anyone else to go through the awful experience of having their personal and private conversations listened to by scores of strangers. ""It is surely in everyone's interests for the law to be changed to prevent people outside the authorities using sophisticated spying devices that have such an intrusive impact."" Sir Frederick's case documents allege that the defendants obtained knowledge of his ""conversations with Sidra Capital, which at the time had made an initial offer of some Â£1.3bn for the acquisition of the Ritz hotel"". CCTV footage from the Ritz is at the centre of a legal battle between the families of the Barclay brothers ""Despite this, the defendants sold the Ritz hotel to another buyer from Qatar at a price that appears to be half the market price. One is left to speculate why."" The hotel was sold by Sir David's side of the family in March to the Qatari businessman Abdulhadi Mana al-Hajri. Sir Frederick had threatened legal action if the Ritz was sold for less than Â£1bn. The once inseparable brothers, who used to live together in a mock gothic castle on the Channel island of Brecqhou, purchased the five star hotel for Â£75m in 1995. Shortly after Alistair Barclay, a former racing car driver, was caught on film handling the alleged bugging device, Amanda was removed as a director of the Ritz. On the same day, two of David's other sons, Aidan and Howard were made directors of the Ritz. Aidan and Howard Barclay, pictured in 2008 It is also claimed a separate Wi-Fi bug was supplied by private investigation firm Quest Global. Its chairman is former Metropolitan Police commissioner Lord Stevens. The claimants' documents say that Quest invoiced for 405 hours of listening and transcribing. The recordings, it is alleged, captured ""private, confidential, personal and Sir Frederick's privileged conversations with his lawyers, and with his daughter's trustees, bankers and businesspeople"". The business conversations also touched on details of Sir Frederick's divorce and his granddaughter's special needs, the documents allege. According to the claimants' documents, the recordings took place ""when there were significant ongoing commercial disputes between the parties concerning - among other things - the sale of the Ritz hotel, the financial performance and management of the group, C2 (Amanda Barclay's) continuing financial interests in the group, and C1 (Sir Frederick's) divorce proceedings"". It is said that the defendants were able to ""anticipate (Sir Frederick's) every move in advance, plan their business strategy around thatâ¦ at this crucial time when their business and personal relationships had broken down, and the respective interests of the claimants and the defendants were in conflict"". Late last year, Sir David's side of the family tightened its hold on the Barclay empire. His sons Aidan and Howard were appointed as ""persons with significant control"" of Ellerman Holdings, the holding company for the Barclays' UK interests. Aidan Barclay is also the chairman of Telegraph Media Group - publishers of the Daily Telegraph and the Sunday Telegraph. Ellerman holdings has previously said that it was focused on obtaining best value for its shareholders in relation to the sale of the Ritz. Sir Frederick is described in the court documents as ""a man now left to contemplate his nephews' betrayal and a father who's witnessed the prejudicial treatment of his daughter"". Heather Rogers, the lawyer for the defendants, told the hearing on 6 May that Sir Frederick and Amanda's claims had been put in an ""eye-catching and emotive"" way. She said: ""This is a dispute about family members and, from the defendants' point of view, it is unfortunate that they are being canvassed in public rather than resolved in the family."" A defence to the action has yet to be filed and a trial will take place at a later date. Who are the Barclay brothers?

"Testing will be rolled out to everyone over the age of five with symptoms of coronavirus Everyone aged five and over in the UK with symptoms can now be tested for coronavirus, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has announced. He was speaking in Parliament after theloss of taste or smell was added to the list of Covid-19 symptoms, alongside a fever and a new persistent cough. Mr Hancock said the government was ""expanding eligibility for testing further than ever before"". He added 100,678 tests had been conducted on Sunday. Testing in England and Scotland has been limited to people with symptoms who are key workers and their families, hospital patients, care home residents, over-65s and those who need to leave home to work. In Wales and Northern Ireland it was just key workers, hospital workers and care home residents. Mr Hancock said that priority for testing would still be given to NHS staff and care home workers and residents to ""protect our most vulnerable"". A further 160 coronavirus deaths have been recorded in the UK as of 17:00 BST on Sunday taking the official total to 34,796 - the highest figure in Europe. Who is being tested in the UK? What symptoms should I now look out for? How long does it take to recover from coronavirus? Earlier, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced the extension of testing thereas she revealed lockdown measures would be eased from 28 May. Meanwhile, Northern Ireland has also announced an easing of lockdownincluding new rules to allow groups of four to six people who do not share a household to meet outdoors. The UK government has ramped up testing and made it part of its five goals to meet in order to leave lockdown. The prime minister has set a target for a daily capacity of 200,000 by the end of the month and last week the UK had reached a capacity of 150,000 a day. So far the most tests done in a day is 136,000, on Friday, but this included kits posted out and not necessarily returned. Health professionals haveraised concerns about the accuracy of some testsas well as the time it takes for results to be returned to patients. NHS Providers, the association of NHS trusts in England, said the average test return was five days with the longest wait being 13 days. Chief executive Chris Hopson said the testing regime was ""still a very long way from being fit for purpose"" and said that the gap between the tone struck in public statements and the reality on the ground was ""painfully wide"". One person who had been tested at Lea Valley in north London, Michael Saunders, told the BBC's Hugh Pym it was ""disappointing"" that he had been waiting for five days for his result. ""If you are going to make testing a central part of how we deal with this virus you have got to make it right,"" he said. Shadow health and social care secretary Jonathan Ashworth pressed the government on the time taken for results to be received on whether someone had Covid-19 or not. He also asked if facilities could be set up to allow poorer people to be able to self-isolate if they are required to do so and whether those in insecure work would be guaranteed sick pay if they were asked to isolate. The expansion of the testing programme may grab the headlines. It is a significant milestone - in less than two months the UK has gone from only being able to test hospital patients and health and care staff to offering it more or less population-wide. But it should not mask the difficulties that remain getting the test, track and trace system up-and-running. This will be essential to contain local outbreaks as we ease ourselves out of lockdown. Tests are still taking too long to turnaround for some - significant numbers are thought to be waiting several days - while thepiloting of the tracking app on the Isle of Wightis not yet finished. One particular concern is that the app does not yet let users know if the person they have had contact with ends up testing positive. Instead, it has only let them know if the contact has developed symptoms. That is a major problem. It means people have been left in limbo and incorporating that feature into the app will be important. Progress is being made, but getting a workable and efficient system in place soon is still a monumental challenge. Mr Hancock also said the government is in the ""closing stages"" of negotiations to purchase new Covid-19 antibody tests. A test developed by Swiss pharmaceutical company Roche was approved for use by Public Health England last week. Mr Hancock said developments in tracking and tracing meant England was on course to meet the requirements for the next stage of easing lockdown restrictions on 1 June. He told parliament 21,000 people had been recruited to conductcontact-tracingin England, including 7,500 healthcare workers. This is when people who have come into contact with someone with the virus are tracked down and potentially asked to self-isolate. The new recruits will be trained to identify people and advise them on whether to isolate. Speaking at the Downing Street press briefing, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab defended the government's record on testing and the development of the test and trace app. He said: ""We are learning all the way as we go through this pandemic, not just on the scientific side but on the innovation that we need to get a grip on it. ""We are making good progress on the testing and on the tracing and on the pilot in the Isle of Wight in relation to the app."" The foreign secretary said the app would be ready in ""the coming weeks"" but could not confirm it would be ready before children start returning to school. England's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam told Monday's press briefing that only once there was a vaccine ""really capable of suppressing disease levels"" will the country be ""out of this"". ""So from that perspective we may have to live, and learn to live, with this virus in the long-term, certainly for many months to come if not several years,"" he said. He added it was unclear if there was seasonality to the virus and whether it would come back in autumn and winter. On Sunday the government announced it had an agreement for 30 million doses of a vaccine if a trial at the University of Oxford was successful. The first hints that a vaccine can train people's immune system to fight coronavirushave been reported by a US company. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

Testing eligibility, like lockdown measures, is devolved for individual nations to set their own rules. Mr Hancock made his announcement on the extension of testing across the UK after all four nations agreed to the change.

"Students applying for university places in England must be told with ""absolute clarity"" how courses will be taught - before they make choices for the autumn, says the university watchdog. Courses might still be online - and Nicola Dandridge of the Office for Students warned against misleading promises about a ""campus experience"". University campuses have been closed this term by the Covid-19 outbreak. But universities can charge full fees even if courses are taught online. ""The important thing here is absolute clarity to students, so they know what they're getting in advance of accepting offers,"" Ms Dandridge told MPs on the education select committee. ""What we don't want to see are promises that it's all going to be back to usual - an on-campus experience - when it turns out that's not the case,"" said the chief executive of the Office for Student (OFS). More than 300,000 sign petition calling for refund on tuition fees Students will have to pay full fees for online courses, says minister Universities warn of going bust without a bail-out Students angry at rent being charged on empty rooms The OFS says this information should be provided for students before they make a firm choice in June - and ""certainly before"" the clearing process that follows students getting their A-level grades in August. If universities have to update plans after students have made a decision, the OFS says universities should release students from any acceptances and allow them to ""change their minds"". Applicants this year will be waiting to see whether courses will be taught by distance learning or on campus, or a combination of both - and whether they will have accommodation, which might be limited by social distancing. Ms Dandridge told MPs that before students make decisions they need to know ""what they are getting"". She suggested a likely outcome would be ""much greater and more sophisticated use of blended learning so that's face-to-face plus online,"" she said - and that it must not only be ""bunging lectures online"". Universities Minister Michelle Donelan has already said that even if their courses are only taught online, students would still be liable for the same full tuition fee as those being taught in-person. The University of Manchester has said that its lectures will be online next term - but it wanted to allow small group teaching as soon as safely possible. Other universities are considering a delay to the start of the autumn term - and there have been suggestions that some more ""hands-on"" courses will be taught first on campus while others might remain online. Universities are facing their own cash problems from an anticipated reduction in the number of overseas students. Debra Humphris, chair of the University Alliance group of universities, said the scale of the financial challenge would not really be clear until the end of the autumn admissions process. She said support from the government would bring forward existing money to help with cashflow, but ""it's not additional funding"". Jo Grady, leader of the UCU lecturers' union, told MPs there needed to be clear guidance from the government on how and when universities should reopen buildings in the autumn - and not to leave decision to institutions in competition with each other. She warned that financial pressure could mean ""some universities will rush to re-open"". ""They will want to promise students that they will be re-opening next semester in order to attract those students, rather than have them go somewhere else"". Dr Grady said that university campuses would not be easy places for social distancing - and that lecture halls would bring together ""two or three hundred people"". ""Students go from cafes to libraries to restaurants - everywhere is always rammed,"" she said. A spokeswoman for Universities UK said universities were ""already preparing for a range of scenarios - including periods of online study in the academic year 2020-21"". ""Institutions will be communicating their plans to prospective and current students in the weeks ahead."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

"Security staff and police officers are on duty at New Street station in Birmingham Security guards trained in crowd control have been put on duty at some major railway stations following the easing of coronavirus restrictions. Train firms operated reduced services during lockdown, but more frequent trains are now running in England. People are being encouraged to go back to work in England, but only to use public transport for essential journeys when they have no alternative. Some industry figures expressed concern over increased passenger numbers. Network Rail said passenger numbers on Monday were ""very similar"" to last week, when the figure was slightly up on the previous week. However, footfall through major UK stations was only about 10% of pre-pandemic levels. New crowd-control measures include preventing passengers from boarding a train or entering a platform if there are already too many people. And more radical steps are being considered, such as passengers being required to book time slots for when they can arrive at a station. Edinburgh Waverley station was quiet on Monday morning Transport for London has been encouraged by the government to get bus and train capacity back to 100% to help combat overcrowding Train operators are already planning to limit numbers boarding specific services. Many intercity trains will bereservation onlyand Avanti West Coast has said it would not allow carriages to be more than a third full. Some train companies will block off seats to ensure that passengers spread out. It is also possible that if a service becomes busy early on, then trains will not stop at other destinations along their routes. In future, train operators might not open the doors of certain carriages at earlier stations along a route so that people can get on at a later stop and still have the necessary space to keep their distance. 'I'm not happy going back to work. It's too soon' Coronavirus: What's the risk on public transport? Commuters told 'prepare to queue' in new guidance How will transport need to change? Network Rail chairman Sir Peter Hendy said an ""enormous"" effort had been made to manage the flow of passengers. Stations have been reorganised, signs have been installed and space could be made outside for queuing in case entrances and exits are closed. ""We are relying on people to be sensible,"" he told BBC Breakfast - adding that the rail industry was ""keen"" for people to wear face coverings while on public transport. ""We want people to stay apart if they humanly can and if they can't, then a face covering is a quite sensible thing to do for the brief moments when you might be getting on or off a train or moving through a station,"" he said. However, senior figures from the rail industry insist they will not be policing whether people are following government guidelines. One-way systems to promote social distancing are already in place at stations, such as Clapham Junction in south-west London Manchester city centre also looked quiet on Monday PC Jason Kelly said the number of passengers on his train from King's Cross to north Hertfordshire had risen from two to up to 40 after lockdown measures were eased last week. The officer, who was returning home after a night shift, was not confident that social distancing measures could be met if passenger numbers rise further. ""For some people it's just like a normal day, people have got fed up with [coronavirus], they've had enough,"" he said. People in England who are allowed to return to work have been asked not to use public transport if possible. People in Waleshave been told to avoid public transportwhere possible, and areduced timetable,externalwill remain in place on Transport for Wales rail services. Limited public transport services are running in Scotland,externalfor people who absolutely need to get to workand the situation is similar in Northern Ireland.,external Transport for London (TfL) said it was introducing one-way systems, safety signs and announcements, and hand sanitiser dispensers to help people to keep to social distancing measures in the capital. TfL says it will regularly update guidance on the20 busiest stations,externalto help people to avoid those areas. TfL reveals 20 busiest stations 'to avoid' Tube trains are being cleaned with anti-viral disinfectant, througout the pandemic The capital's public transport network has spoken to about 300 businesses and Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has indicated that office start times would be staggered to manage demand on public transport. Meanwhile London's congestion charge, which was suspended in March, has been reintroduced. Gates will be used to prevent people from entering stations if it becomes too busy Staff often outnumber passengers here at Euston station. British Transport Police officers and security guards are on duty, in case there are crowds. Every so often dozens of people stream off a platform when a train arrives into London. However it's still incredibly quiet. Yellow gates, which are folded-away, are dotted around. They could be used to close entrance points to the station or specific platforms if there are too many people. There is hand sanitiser on offer in the centre of the concourse. It's weird for station managers to be pleased that there aren't many passengers - but that's the situation here this morning. During the crisis the government is covering the losses made by train companies, which saw revenues evaporate when travel restrictions began.

"Security staff and police officers are on duty at New Street station in Birmingham Security guards trained in crowd control have been put on duty at some major railway stations following the easing of coronavirus restrictions. Train firms operated reduced services during lockdown, but more frequent trains are now running in England. People are being encouraged to go back to work in England, but only to use public transport for essential journeys when they have no alternative. Some industry figures expressed concern over increased passenger numbers. Network Rail said passenger numbers on Monday were ""very similar"" to last week, when the figure was slightly up on the previous week. However, footfall through major UK stations was only about 10% of pre-pandemic levels. New crowd-control measures include preventing passengers from boarding a train or entering a platform if there are already too many people. And more radical steps are being considered, such as passengers being required to book time slots for when they can arrive at a station. Edinburgh Waverley station was quiet on Monday morning Transport for London has been encouraged by the government to get bus and train capacity back to 100% to help combat overcrowding Train operators are already planning to limit numbers boarding specific services. Many intercity trains will bereservation onlyand Avanti West Coast has said it would not allow carriages to be more than a third full. Some train companies will block off seats to ensure that passengers spread out. It is also possible that if a service becomes busy early on, then trains will not stop at other destinations along their routes. In future, train operators might not open the doors of certain carriages at earlier stations along a route so that people can get on at a later stop and still have the necessary space to keep their distance. 'I'm not happy going back to work. It's too soon' Coronavirus: What's the risk on public transport? Commuters told 'prepare to queue' in new guidance How will transport need to change? Network Rail chairman Sir Peter Hendy said an ""enormous"" effort had been made to manage the flow of passengers. Stations have been reorganised, signs have been installed and space could be made outside for queuing in case entrances and exits are closed. ""We are relying on people to be sensible,"" he told BBC Breakfast - adding that the rail industry was ""keen"" for people to wear face coverings while on public transport. ""We want people to stay apart if they humanly can and if they can't, then a face covering is a quite sensible thing to do for the brief moments when you might be getting on or off a train or moving through a station,"" he said. However, senior figures from the rail industry insist they will not be policing whether people are following government guidelines. One-way systems to promote social distancing are already in place at stations, such as Clapham Junction in south-west London Manchester city centre also looked quiet on Monday PC Jason Kelly said the number of passengers on his train from King's Cross to north Hertfordshire had risen from two to up to 40 after lockdown measures were eased last week. The officer, who was returning home after a night shift, was not confident that social distancing measures could be met if passenger numbers rise further. ""For some people it's just like a normal day, people have got fed up with [coronavirus], they've had enough,"" he said. People in England who are allowed to return to work have been asked not to use public transport if possible. People in Waleshave been told to avoid public transportwhere possible, and areduced timetable,externalwill remain in place on Transport for Wales rail services. Limited public transport services are running in Scotland,externalfor people who absolutely need to get to workand the situation is similar in Northern Ireland.,external Transport for London (TfL) said it was introducing one-way systems, safety signs and announcements, and hand sanitiser dispensers to help people to keep to social distancing measures in the capital. TfL says it will regularly update guidance on the20 busiest stations,externalto help people to avoid those areas. TfL reveals 20 busiest stations 'to avoid' Tube trains are being cleaned with anti-viral disinfectant, througout the pandemic The capital's public transport network has spoken to about 300 businesses and Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has indicated that office start times would be staggered to manage demand on public transport. Meanwhile London's congestion charge, which was suspended in March, has been reintroduced. Gates will be used to prevent people from entering stations if it becomes too busy Staff often outnumber passengers here at Euston station. British Transport Police officers and security guards are on duty, in case there are crowds. Every so often dozens of people stream off a platform when a train arrives into London. However it's still incredibly quiet. Yellow gates, which are folded-away, are dotted around. They could be used to close entrance points to the station or specific platforms if there are too many people. There is hand sanitiser on offer in the centre of the concourse. It's weird for station managers to be pleased that there aren't many passengers - but that's the situation here this morning. During the crisis the government is covering the losses made by train companies, which saw revenues evaporate when travel restrictions began. But industry forecasting predicts that significant passenger numbers will return several weeks from now. RISK AT WORK:How exposed is your job? SCHOOLS:When will children be returning? EXERCISE:What are the guidelines on getting out? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? BBC transport correspondent Tom Burridge said train companies have said they are nervous about how the situation can be managed, once crowds return, with one source saying: ""We are counting on the individual conduct of passengers.""

"Aya Hachem was taken to hospital where she was pronounced dead a short time later A young woman shot dead near a supermarket was not the intended target, officers have said. Aya Hachem was found with fatal injuries in King Street in Blackburn, close to Lidl, on Sunday. The 19-year-old law student, described as ""truly remarkable"", was going to the shop at about 15:00 BST when she was shot from a passing car, police said. Three men, aged 33, 36, and 39 from Blackburn have been arrested on suspicion of murder and are in custody. A Toyota Avensis, believed to have been used in the killing, was later found abandoned on Wellington Road. A number of occupants were in the car, which has the registration number SV53 UBP, as it passed Ms Hachem, police said. Detectives have urged ""anyone with information to search their consciences and come forward"". ""There is no evidence to suggest Aya was the intended target of this attack and every indication is that she was an innocent passerby,"" the force said. Police believe a Toyota Avensis was used to commit the offence Ms Hachem's parents have paid tribute to the ""most loyal devoted daughter"" who ""dreamed of becoming a solicitor"". ""We are absolutely devastated by her death and would like to take this opportunity to plead with any members of the public who may have any information however small that may bring those responsible to justice,"" they said. Ms Hachem was one of four siblings and lived in Blackburn after travelling to the UK about nine years ago, her cousin Hassan told the BBC. Her family was waiting for the investigation to finish so they could take her body back to Lebanon to be buried in her home village Qlaileh, he said. Ms Hachem, who was a young trustee for the Children's Society, was described as a ""truly remarkable young woman, and an inspiring voice for children and young people"" by its chief executive Mark Russell. Dr Janice Allan, Dean of Salford Business School, said Ms Hachem was ""a very popular and promising second year student whose contribution went beyond the classroom"". The Asylum and Refugee Community, a charity working with asylum seekers and refugees in the Blackburn and Darwen area, said Ms Hachem had been the victim of ""a horrific senseless attack"". ""It is with great sadness and heartache we have to share with you that we have lost Aya, beloved eldest daughter of Samar and Ismael from Lebanon,"" it added. Ms Hachem was found with fatal injuries in King Street at about 15:00 BST on Sunday The family of Yousef Makki, who wasstabbed to death in Hale Barns in 2019,have also paid tribute to the 19-year-old. ""Another act of senseless violence that has ripped apart another family, our hearts and thoughts go out to Aya and her family at this heart-breaking time,"" said the Makki family, who were friends with Ms Hachem's family. Police said the force was not treating the killing as a terror-related incident and also did not believe it was racially-motivated. ""This is a truly shocking and senseless killing, which has robbed a young woman of her life,"" said Det Supt Jonathan Holmes. ""We appreciate this will have caused a lot of worry in the community, but we have deployed significant additional resources, including armed officers, to carry out high-visibility patrols in the area to provide reassurance to residents.""

"Mr Gaiman left his wife Amanda Palmer and son behind in Auckland Police have spoken to author Neil Gaiman after he admitted breaking Scotland's lockdown rules by travelling 11,000 miles from New Zealand to Skye. The Good Omens and American Gods writer left his wife and son in Auckland so he could""isolate"" at his island retreat. He wrote on his online blog: ""Hullo from Scotland, where I am in rural lockown on my own."" Police Scotland said officers had visited Mr Gaiman at his holiday home on Skye. Insp Linda Allan said the officers spoke to the author ""about his actions"". She said: ""He has been given suitable advice about essential travel and reminded about the current guidelines in Scotland."" The science fiction and fantasy author has been criticised for ""endangering"" local people"". The SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford, who is the MP for the island, toldthe Sunday Times,externalthe author's journey was unacceptable. He said: ""What is it about people, when they know we are in the middle of lockdown that they think they can come here from the other side of the planet, in turn endangering local people from exposure to this infection that they could have picked up at any step of the way?"" Kate Forbes, SNP MSP for Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch, also criticised the writer's actions. She said: ""The remarkable thing is that he posted a blog post about his travel to Skye - evidently oblivious to local residents' concerns and outrage about people breaking lockdown and putting their community at risk. ""The Highlands does not exist for anybody's personal self-isolation needs."" Mr Gaiman - whose main family home is in Woodstock in the USA - has owned the house on Skye for more than 10 years. The English-born author wroteon his blog,externalthat until two weeks ago he had been living in New Zealand with his wife, the singer Amanda Palmer, and their four-year-old son. He said the couple agreed ""that we needed to give each other some space"". The 59-year-old said he flew ""masked and gloved, from empty Auckland airport"" to Los Angeles. He then caught a British Airways flight to London before borrowing a friend's car and heading for Skye. ""I drove north, on empty motorways and then on empty roads, and got in about midnight, and I've been here ever since,"" he said. ""I needed to be somewhere I could talk to people in the UK while they and I were awake, not just before breakfast and after dinner. And I needed to be somewhere I could continue to isolate easily. ""It's rough for almost everyone right now - some people are crammed together and wish they weren't, some are alone and crave companionship, pretty much all of us are hurting in one way or another. So be kind."" Mr Gaiman, whose best known works include American Gods, Good Omens and the children's novel Coraline, has described Skye as his favourite place in the world and the best place for him to write.

"This video can not be played Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary says quarantine measures are 'laughably ineffective' Ryanair has said it expects passenger numbers to halve in the current financial year as the coronavirus crisis continues to blight air travel. The airline said it expected numbers to fall below 80 million, down from its original target of 154 million. But it said it would weather the pandemic and emerge stronger. Chief executive Michael O'Leary said Ryanair still planned to ramp up flights in July and said UK government quarantine plans were ""idiotic"". The prediction of lower passenger numbers came as Ryanair announced profits of just over â¬1bn (Â£894m) for the financial year to the end of March. The airline's profit was 13% up on the previous year's figure of â¬885m. Ryanair is set to cut 3,000 jobs - 15% of its workforce - as it restructures to cope with the coronavirus crisis. Chief executive Michael O'Leary told the BBC's Today programme that Ryanair still intended to restart large numbers of flights from July, despite government plans to introduce a 14-day quarantine for people arriving in the UK, including returning holidaymakers. Mr O'Leary repeated his criticism of the quarantine plan, saying: ""It's idiotic and it's un-implementable. You don't have enough police in the UK."" He said the policy had ""no credibility"" and predicted that it would be gone by June. Ryanair: Most people will ignore 14 day quarantine Ryanair flyers must ask for loo as flights ramp up Airlines warned over passenger refund rights Ryanair said 2021 would be a ""difficult"" year as it worked hard to return to scheduled flying. But it said its balance sheet was one of the strongest in the industry, with cash reserves of more than â¬4bn. ""Unlike many flag carrier competitors, Ryanair will not request or receive state aid,"" it added. Ryanair said it could not provide any profit guidance for the current financial year, but it expected to report a loss of more than â¬200m in the April-to-June period. ""As we look beyond the next year, there will be significant opportunities for Ryanair's low-cost growth model as competitors shrink, fail or are acquired by government bailed-out carriers,"" it said.

Hope for the outcome of a US trial for a Covid-19 vaccine drove a surge in global stocks on Monday. Wall Street made large gains, with the S&P rising 3.2%, the Dow Jones 4% and the Nasdaq 2.4%. While it is hard to pinpoint an exact cause for the surge, it seems to have been boosted by an announcement from Moderna that it had seen positive results in eight people given doses in its early vaccine trials. The rallies also saw a large increase in the price of US crude oil - its biggest hike in two months - leading to a proclamation from the US president that ""oil (energy) is back!!!!"" Captain Tom Moore captured the hearts of the UK, raising more than Â£32m for charity, and now he has inspired another World War Two veteran to do the same. Private Joseph Hammond - a 95-year-old from Ghana - has set himself the challenge of walking two miles a day for a week to raise money for coronavirus charities. He hopes to raise $600,000 (Â£500,000) for frontline workers and vulnerable veterans across Africa. Private Hammond fought with the British army in Burma, in the Gold Coast Regiment of the Royal West African Frontier Force. Greece has had a total of 2,834 cases and 163 deaths from coronavirus Greece has urged the UK to exempt Greeks from a planned quarantine for arrivals to Britain. It would be in return for British people being able to enter Greece. The British government has said it will introduce a 14-day quarantine for all arrivals to the UK with the exception of Ireland from early June. But on Monday the UK transport secretary saidpeople coming from countries with low rates of infectioncould be exempted in the future. ""The kind of aggressiveness this country (the UK) is showing in making the decisions is totally understandable,"" Greek tourism minister Harris Theoharis told the BBC. ""What I can say is we think this is a time for us to start lifting restrictions, and to try and remove as many barriers as possible."" The Greek economy is heavily reliant on tourism. The EU last week promised thatEurope will have a summer tourist seasonin some form. The Greek tourism minister was speaking the BBC's Coronavirus Newscast. Listenhere  US President Donald Trump has said he is taking hydroxychloroquine in an attempt to ward off coronavirus. Trump has previously touted the malaria drug as a treatment for coronavirus, but there is scant scientific evidence it can fight off Covid-19. Clinical trials are under way to see if it is at all effective. ""I'm taking it for about a week and a half now and I'm still here, I'm still here,"" Trump told reporters on Monday. Asked what  evidence he had for he drug's positive benefits, Mr Trump said: ""Here's my evidence, I get a lot of positive calls about it."" The US coronavirus death toll has passed 90,000, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The US toll now stands 90,312 - the highest of any nation in the world. The UK has reported the second highest death toll with 34,876, followed by Italy with 32,007. France's highest administrative court has ruled the government must lift a blanket ban on meetings at places of
worship imposed as part of measures to combat the coronavirus, AFP reports. The latest rules ban all gatherings in places of worship except funerals which are limited to 20 people. The Council of State has ruled such a ban
on freedom of worship caused ""a damage that is serious and manifestly
illegal"" and is ""disproportionate in nature."" It told the government to lift
the ban within the next eight days. Tony Blair has spoken to BBC Newsnight about coronavirus and global leadership Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair has said in a BBC interview that it is right to reopen schools. Speaking amid a row about the safety of bringing teachers and children back to the classroom from 1 June, he says he believes the government's approach is based on evidence. ""I donât think they would say that theyâre putting school opening above health risks. What theyâre doing is basing it on the evidence, actually. There are countries that have reopened parts, at least, of their school system. ""If you look at all the best evidence, and my institute has assembled a lot of the different data on this, especially for younger children, the risks of transmission are actually quite low."" Blair, who runs the Tony Blair Institute For Global Change, also said he was shocked by ""the absence of global leadership"" in particular from the US. The West should ""stand together"" in a new relationship with China, he says. ""I think we need a strategic response to China, not simply ad-hoc or reactive response on individual issues or questions."" The full Newsnight interview can be seen at 22.30 BST on BBC Two Western New York is expected to begin reopening on Tuesday, according to New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. The region - which contains Niagara Falls - will join Central New York, Finger Lakes, Mohawk Valley, North County and Southern Tier in phase-one reopening. This means parts of the economy including retail, agriculture, construction and manufacturing may soon start up again. There were 106 coronavirus-related deaths yesterday in New York state, taking the total to more than 28,000. Cuomo also used his press briefing to announce that he wants professional sports teams to start competing again without fans in attendance. ""Hockey, basketball, baseball, football, whoever can reopen. We're a ready, willing and able partner,"" he said. BBC OS We spoke to three new mothers about giving birth and caring for their new child during a pandemic. Here are their stories. Brooke Young Russellis in New York City. She had her son on 12 April, and had to wear a mask while giving birth to him as she was right next to coronavirus patients in the hospital. She was initially told that her partner couldn't be with her for the birth, but then thousands signed a petition to get the hospital to reverse its decision, which it did. ""My mom hasn't met my son yet and that is traumatising for me... my family's absence feels so much stronger now because there's no way that they can be here. The fact that my mother hasn't been able to hold her grandson yet just kills me every time."" Salma Ishaqis in London. She gave birth on 10 March, at 27 weeks. Her baby is in hospital and, before lockdown, she and her husband could visit the neonatal unit 24 hours a day. ""When the lockdown came in, the hospital policies changed. In the unit I'm in, dads are not able to visit at all and mums only for two hours. ""Twice he's had to be resuscitated and having to go in by yourself, without your husband being allowed, and going and seeing your baby in an incubator, having the ventilator... I'd kind of gone into this survival mode. Now that it's been two months I've started to process it a bit more."" Vicky Kavanaghis in Dublin, and gave birth in January. ""We live very near to my in-laws and we're very lucky - they're very involved in our lives. They were able to spend a bit of time with their granddaughter before everything kicked in."" ""I always think of all the things she's missing out on. The closeness she should have had with her grandparents. ""There's this whole chapter of her life that only me and her father have witnessed and it's been very isolating for the three of us going through that."" You can listen to the full story here. South Sudan's Vice President Riek Machar and his wife Angelina Teny, the country's defence minister, have tested positive for coronavirus. Machar, who is in his late 60s, was tested on 13 May after one of the members of the government 's Covid-19 task force tested positive. He says he has no symptoms and will self-isolate for the next 14 days. A number of Macharâs bodyguards and staff have also been found positive. South Sudan has recorded 236 cases of the virus, while four people have died.

Ray McDermott, 96, is originally from Carmarthenshire, Wales, but she has  lived in the US for 70 years. She worried she would never speak Welsh again after her mother died four decades ago. ""I don't think I'll ever have a chance to speak Welsh again,"" she recently told her son Keith. Worried about his mum's loneliness and memory-loss, Keith put out a call on social media for Welsh speakers. Within 30 minutes, he was deluged with responses. One of those who responded was Melisa Annis - a director and playwright originally from Cardiff but living in New York. She gave Ray a call. ""It's a very hard time at the moment and we are all feeling a little bit isolated and especially if you are older. I thought, 'Why not reach out?' I am a fluent Welsh speaker and very pro the Welsh language,"" Melisa said. Ray's first words in Welsh, after 40 years, were: ""I used to talk in Welsh with my mum."" Read the full story here. In Rome, Italy, a limit on the number of people allowed on trains have been introduced With lockdowns easing across much of Europe and the US, and some sectors returning to work, you might be wondering how safe  public transport is. Many cities are urging commuters to cycle or walk instead of catching a bus or train, but in some cases, there is no other option. A lot of the potential risk of infection on trains and buses depends on how crowded they are, and how far away you can keep from other people. Ventilation also plays an important role as fresh air can help droplets containing the virus dissipate faster. In the UK, the advice for people taking public transport incudes: Read more about the infection risks on public transport.

Work on a coronavirus vaccine has been taking place at unprecedented speed Earlier we reported about a promising early trial for a Covid-19 vaccine produced by Moderna Inc. Share prices in the US pharmaceutical company have shot up. Now, here's some more information about what the vaccine trials have found. In the first eight people who took part in Moderna Inc's trials, antibodies were found that can neutralise coronavirus. Even people taking the lowest dose of the trial vaccine produced antibodies at the same levels seen in patients who recover from Covid-19. But there is still some way to go. Testing for these neutralising antibodies has only taken place on the first eight, out of 45, people on the trial. And it will take larger trials to see if people are protected against the virus. Our Health Correspondent James Gallagher has been delving more deeply into this development. Read more here.

Celtic captain Scott Brown has sprouted a head of hair in time to celebrate another title It's been another eventful, landmark day in Scottish football, with Celtic crowned league champions and Hearts relegated from the top flight after the Scottish Professional Football League board agreed toend the Premiership season. As Celtic fans on the whole heeded club calls not to celebrate at the club's stadium, chief executive Peter Lawwell said""no-one can deny""that Neil Lennon's team, who were 13 points clear of Rangers when the Covid-19 crisis halted fixtures, deserve to win their ninth title in a row. However, Hearts, who were four points behind Hamilton Academical,have left the door opento a possible legal challenge. Club chair Ann Budge was last week given approval to work on a proposal for temporary league reconstruction, which would involve expanding the top flight, and Hearts today said they hope this will ""avoid the need to go down"" the legal route.

So says Alex Mackie, founder of the Foundation of Hearts, which has helped finance the Edinburgh club. Celtic have also been declared champions and Mackie tells BBC Radio Scotland:""The probability that Celtic would have won the league is medium to
high, but the probability that we would have been relegated was not certain at all. ""There were eight games to go and we could have clawed our way

been the same amount of transparency around local authority care homes from the Scottish government as from the independent sector. He argues this means 20% of care homes in Scotland â the proportion
run by councils â are being judged by a different system with a different level of scrutiny. Mr Kilgour also tells Drivetime Renaissance Careâs last audited
figures show a turnover of Â£21m, with Â£1m of pre-tax profit. He said it needed to
profit around 6-7% because of tax and bank debt. He says local authorities paid the independent sector less
than what it takes to look after a person in their own care homes. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland The success of a vaccine against Covid-19 depends on the virus staying stable and not mutating, Scotland's national clinical director, Prof Jason Leitch, explains. ""Vaccines are not this huge panacea - they are not 100% reliable,"" he admits on BBC Radio Scotland. ""The problem with the flu one is that the flu virus notoriously is tricky to pin down - we don't know which one we are going to get come each December. ""Measles vaccine is, on the other hand, very reliable. Same virus, hasn't mutated, we know when it's coming. ""We are hoping that the coronavirus will be the same and it won't do something weird and that, in a year's time, it doesn't look different. All of the science so far suggests that this coronavirus is pretty stable genetically. ""So we are hopeful that, of the 300 vaccine trials that are going across the world just now, one or two of them will be successful going into the turn of the year, the start of next year.""

At the UK government briefing the BBC's Fergus Walsh asks whether the UK was slow to include loss of taste and smell (anosmia) as one of the official symptoms to watch out for in coronavirus cases, given that France identified it at the start of March. How many extra deaths may have been avoided if it had been done so earlier, he asks. In response, Dr Van-Tam said the decision to list anosmia as one of the symptoms to look out for had only been done following ""painstaking"" and thorough scientific research. He says it is a complicated process, given people display various symptoms at different times during the illness. He says the number of people displaying loss of taste and smell without any other symptoms is ""very small"", as a proportion of overall cases, and scientists had to decide how much of a difference it would make to the overall treatment. He ends by referring to early research suggesting less than 0.5% of those who have died have displayed anosmia. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Scotland's health boards will step in to help care homes who are left short of staff struck down by Covid-19, national clinical director Prof Jason Leitch has vowed. Prof Leitch tells BBC Radio Scotland that the NHS will be able to help because parts of its own service have been suspended because of the coronavirus outbreak. Drivetime's John Beattie asks about reports that some care home staff are terrified to be absent because of low pay and would knowingly continue working with symptoms. ""The salaries and economics of care home development are a step above my pay grade,"" Prof Leitch replies. ""But let me be abundantly clear - anything that stops people staying off work, if they either have symptoms and/or a positive test, is wrong and we should do everything we can - government, local government and private providers - to make that not happen."" The issue has resurfaced after the Scottish government extended the amount of testing available for care home staff. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"This video can not be played Sir Frederick Barclay's nephew is allegedly seen handling a bugging device at London's Ritz hotel CCTV footage allegedly showing Sir Frederick Barclay's nephew handling a bugging device at London's Ritz hotel has been released. The footage is at the centre of a bitter legal row between the families of the billionaire Barclay twins. Sir Frederick, 85, and his daughter Amanda are suing three of Sir David Barclay's sons for invasion of privacy. They claim the surveillance gave the men commercial advantage and they sold the Ritz for half its market value. The Barclay brothers' businesses include the Telegraph Media Group, the online retailer Very Group, the delivery business Yodel, and - at the time of the bugging - the Ritz hotel in London. Who are the Barclay brothers? Telegraph owners to put paper up for sale Sir Frederick, the elder twin by 10 minutes, and his daughter Amanda are suing Sir David Barclay's sons - Alistair, Aidan and Howard, Aidan's son Andrew, and Philip Peters, a board director of the Barclay group for invasion of privacy, breach of confidence and data protection laws. The claim stems from a falling out between the children of the famously private twins. Sir David Barclay and his twin brother Sir Frederick collecting their knighthoods in 2000 Substantial parts of the brothers' empire are now owned by trusts in which their children are beneficiaries. That means Sir David's three sons exercise a controlling interest as compared with Sir Frederick's daughter Amanda. The CCTV footage allegedly shows Alistair Barclay handling a bugging device at the Ritz hotel on 13 January this year. The recording shows Mr Barclay inserting a plug adaptor, which is claimed to contain a listening device, into a socket. In court documents lodged by Sir Frederick and Amanda Barclay, it is claimed the bug - which was placed in the hotel's conservatory where Sir Frederick liked to conduct business meetings and smoke cigars - captured more than 1,000 separate conversations amounting to some 94 hours of recordings Amanda Barclay, pictured with dancer Anton du Beke in 2009 The pair claim the recordings amount to ""commercial espionage on a vast scale"". Last week the high court declined to order the release of the footage to the media in part because ""the material is in the hands of the claimants, and available to them to provide to the media, if they so choose"". The CCTV footage has now been released by Sir Frederick. In a statement he said: ""The decision to release this video of this deliberate and premeditated invasion of my privacy is in the public interest. ""I do not want anyone else to go through the awful experience of having their personal and private conversations listened to by scores of strangers. ""It is surely in everyone's interests for the law to be changed to prevent people outside the authorities using sophisticated spying devices that have such an intrusive impact."" Sir Frederick's case documents allege that the defendants obtained knowledge of his ""conversations with Sidra Capital, which at the time had made an initial offer of some Â£1.3bn for the acquisition of the Ritz hotel"". CCTV footage from the Ritz is at the centre of a legal battle between the families of the Barclay brothers ""Despite this, the defendants sold the Ritz hotel to another buyer from Qatar at a price that appears to be half the market price. One is left to speculate why."" The hotel was sold by Sir David's side of the family in March to the Qatari businessman Abdulhadi Mana al-Hajri. Sir Frederick had threatened legal action if the Ritz was sold for less than Â£1bn. The once inseparable brothers, who used to live together in a mock gothic castle on the Channel island of Brecqhou, purchased the five star hotel for Â£75m in 1995. Shortly after Alistair Barclay, a former racing car driver, was caught on film handling the alleged bugging device, Amanda was removed as a director of the Ritz. On the same day, two of David's other sons, Aidan and Howard were made directors of the Ritz. Aidan and Howard Barclay, pictured in 2008 It is also claimed a separate Wi-Fi bug was supplied by private investigation firm Quest Global. Its chairman is former Metropolitan Police commissioner Lord Stevens. The claimants' documents say that Quest invoiced for 405 hours of listening and transcribing. The recordings, it is alleged, captured ""private, confidential, personal and Sir Frederick's privileged conversations with his lawyers, and with his daughter's trustees, bankers and businesspeople"". The business conversations also touched on details of Sir Frederick's divorce and his granddaughter's special needs, the documents allege. According to the claimants' documents, the recordings took place ""when there were significant ongoing commercial disputes between the parties concerning - among other things - the sale of the Ritz hotel, the financial performance and management of the group, C2 (Amanda Barclay's) continuing financial interests in the group, and C1 (Sir Frederick's) divorce proceedings"". It is said that the defendants were able to ""anticipate (Sir Frederick's) every move in advance, plan their business strategy around thatâ¦ at this crucial time when their business and personal relationships had broken down, and the respective interests of the claimants and the defendants were in conflict"". Late last year, Sir David's side of the family tightened its hold on the Barclay empire. His sons Aidan and Howard were appointed as ""persons with significant control"" of Ellerman Holdings, the holding company for the Barclays' UK interests. Aidan Barclay is also the chairman of Telegraph Media Group - publishers of the Daily Telegraph and the Sunday Telegraph. Ellerman holdings has previously said that it was focused on obtaining best value for its shareholders in relation to the sale of the Ritz. Sir Frederick is described in the court documents as ""a man now left to contemplate his nephews' betrayal and a father who's witnessed the prejudicial treatment of his daughter"". Heather Rogers, the lawyer for the defendants, told the hearing on 6 May that Sir Frederick and Amanda's claims had been put in an ""eye-catching and emotive"" way. She said: ""This is a dispute about family members and, from the defendants' point of view, it is unfortunate that they are being canvassed in public rather than resolved in the family."" A defence to the action has yet to be filed and a trial will take place at a later date. Who are the Barclay brothers?

"A law to introduce a new post-Brexit immigration system for the UK has been given initial approval by MPs. The immigration bill repeals EU freedom of movement and introduces the new framework - though not exact details - for who can come to live in the UK. Home Secretary Priti Patel said the government's plans will lead to a ""high skill"" economy. But critics said the coronavirus pandemic has changed public attitudes towards those considered ""unskilled"". The House of Commons approved the general principles of the law by 351 votes to 252 on Monday. It will now go on to receive further scrutiny. The legislation will put EU and European Economic Area (EEA) citizens on an equal footing to immigrants from outside the bloc. It also paves the way for the government to introduce a new points-based system, which some say will affect the ability of care workers to come to the UK. Eight ways new immigration laws will affect industry What's a skilled worker? And other immigration questions No visas for low-skilled workers, government says The government announced proposals for the new system, suggesting points will be awarded for being able to speak English to a certain standard, having a job offer from an approved employer, and meeting a salary threshold of Â£25,600. Other points could be awarded for certain qualifications and if there is a shortage in a particular occupation. Speaking in the Commons, shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said the earnings of frontline workers do not reflect their contribution to society. ""Those who clapped [for carers] on Thursday are only too happy to vote through a bill that will send a powerful message to those same people - that they are not considered by this government to be skilled workers,"" he said. ""Are shop workers unskilled? Are refuse collectors? Are local government workers? Are NHS staff? Are care workers? Of course they are not,"" he said. The Scottish government's immigration minster, Ben Macpherson, has also written to Ms Patel, asking her to ""pause and reconsider"" the plans, saying the coronavirus outbreak has highlighted the need for immigration in frontline services. Introducing the bill in the Commons, the home secretary said: ""The current crisis has shone a light on how we value those who provide compassionate care across health and social care."" Ms Patel said the changes in the bill ""will play a vital role in our recovery plans for the future"". ""It will end free movement and pave the way for a firmer, fairer and simpler system and will attract people we need to drive our country through the recovery stage of coronavirus, laying the foundation of a high wage, high skill productive economy,"" she said. The legislation, the Immigration and Social Security Co-ordination (EU Withdrawal) Bill was first introduced in December 2018, but stalled amid a series of defeats for then PM Theresa May's minority government. The bill is now being reintroduced to the Commons with Boris Johnson's 80-seat majority, meaning it is likely to pass. The plan for a new points-based system will need to be separately approved by Parliament, and it is not clear how soon the formal changes to the current rules will come before MPs. Karolina Gerlich arrived in UK from Poland 12 years ago and has been working in the social care sector ever since. She now works as the executive director of the Care Workers Charity, but says the points-based system the government plans to bring in would have ruled her out from coming to the country ""and supporting as many people as I have"". Ms Gerlich tells the BBC she is ""angry"" about the proposals, saying: ""I think it's terribly heart-breaking that there is this level of misunderstanding about the importance of what care workers do, and the contribution that social care makes, both to the economy and to society in general."" She says the sector is ""quite heavily dependent"" on foreign workers, and limiting who can come to the UK based on their wages could be ""disastrous"", especially after the coronavirus outbreak. ""We've had over 130 care workers die because they were working on the front line,"" says Ms Gerlich. ""And it is going to be more difficult for the sector to recruit after the crisis. With so many people dying, why would anybody dream of going into work in care now?"" In February, Ms Patel said people applying to come to the UK under the proposed system will need to meet strict skills criteria. ""We will no longer have the routes for cheap, low-skilled labour that obviously has dominated immigration and our labour market for far too long in this country,"" she said. This video can not be played Priti Patel: No more routes for cheap, low-skilled labour A YouGov opinion poll commissioned by the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (JCWI) suggests 54% of people now support looser immigration controls for workers regarded as essential during the pandemic. The government list of critical workers during the crisis includes care staff, food processing staff, supermarket workers, and delivery drivers. JCWI's Satbir Singh said such workers ""are not 'unskilled' or unwelcome, they are the backbone of our country and they deserve the security of knowing that this place can be their home too"". Former immigration minister and Tory MP Caroline Nokes called for ""a more nuanced and intelligent discussion about immigration in this country"". She told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""We need to understand [immigration legislation] needs to be done with compassion and understandingâ¦and we need to move away from the really blunt 'skilled' and 'unskilled' terms. ""To be quite frank, they are meaningless and actually really rude to those people who we have been so reliant on, not just in the last eight weeks, but for a very, very long time in this country. "" SNP immigration spokesman Stuart C McDonald criticised the bill, claiming it would ""split even more families apart"". ""It's a bill that will result in many thousands of EU nationals losing their rights in this country overnight and which will extend the reach of the hostile environment still further,"" he said.

Since lockdown began in March, he has ventured out three times in the ""dead of night"" to create his artwork. The first was an image of a couple pulling down their masks to share a kiss. The Bear's first covid-themed street art was painted on a wall in Glasgow's west end Painted on the wall of a tenement in the city's West End, The Bear said he wanted to ""provoke hope"" of life after lockdown. ""And also to show the tightrope between fear and love that many of us are walking at the moment,"" he added. A second piece popped up on Bath Street in early April. It shows a man chained to a bright green coronavirus particle, highlighting the frustration felt by everyone restricted by the virus. This Bath Street scene highlights the frustration felt by many people under lockdown The Bear's latest work - of a doctor in a blue protective mask and gloves - is on a bright white wall in Ashton Lane. He said it was dedicated to all front-line medical workers and symbolised ""our collective gratitude"". He posts his work onThe Rebel Bear Instagram page,external, and has seen photographs of his work in national newspapers and websites. ""The reaction has been brilliant"", he said. ""I really appreciate the support and feel very lucky that people enjoy my work and are able to take something from it."" Banksy reveals 'bathroom' art during lockdown Who is the mysterious artist Banksy? Having created street art in Glasgow and around the world for the past four years, The Bear has inevitably been described as the ""Scottish Banksy"". ""I feel like I am on my own path,"" he told BBC Scotland. ""Saying that, I still feel privileged to be labelled as the 'Scottish Banksy'. ""Banksy and other artists such as blek le rat etc have paved the way for street art and have inspired my journey."" But his main motivation is ""to make people think and hopefully raise a smile"". The Bear says he lives in a cave high up in the wilderness and only ventures into the cities to do his street art - although we're not sure we believe him .

"Security staff and police officers are on duty at New Street station in Birmingham Security guards trained in crowd control have been put on duty at some major railway stations following the easing of coronavirus restrictions. Train firms operated reduced services during lockdown, but more frequent trains are now running in England. People are being encouraged to go back to work in England, but only to use public transport for essential journeys when they have no alternative. Some industry figures expressed concern over increased passenger numbers. Network Rail said passenger numbers on Monday were ""very similar"" to last week, when the figure was slightly up on the previous week. However, footfall through major UK stations was only about 10% of pre-pandemic levels. New crowd-control measures include preventing passengers from boarding a train or entering a platform if there are already too many people. And more radical steps are being considered, such as passengers being required to book time slots for when they can arrive at a station. Edinburgh Waverley station was quiet on Monday morning Transport for London has been encouraged by the government to get bus and train capacity back to 100% to help combat overcrowding Train operators are already planning to limit numbers boarding specific services. Many intercity trains will bereservation onlyand Avanti West Coast has said it would not allow carriages to be more than a third full. Some train companies will block off seats to ensure that passengers spread out. It is also possible that if a service becomes busy early on, then trains will not stop at other destinations along their routes. In future, train operators might not open the doors of certain carriages at earlier stations along a route so that people can get on at a later stop and still have the necessary space to keep their distance. 'I'm not happy going back to work. It's too soon' Coronavirus: What's the risk on public transport? Commuters told 'prepare to queue' in new guidance How will transport need to change? Network Rail chairman Sir Peter Hendy said an ""enormous"" effort had been made to manage the flow of passengers. Stations have been reorganised, signs have been installed and space could be made outside for queuing in case entrances and exits are closed. ""We are relying on people to be sensible,"" he told BBC Breakfast - adding that the rail industry was ""keen"" for people to wear face coverings while on public transport. ""We want people to stay apart if they humanly can and if they can't, then a face covering is a quite sensible thing to do for the brief moments when you might be getting on or off a train or moving through a station,"" he said. However, senior figures from the rail industry insist they will not be policing whether people are following government guidelines. One-way systems to promote social distancing are already in place at stations, such as Clapham Junction in south-west London Manchester city centre also looked quiet on Monday PC Jason Kelly said the number of passengers on his train from King's Cross to north Hertfordshire had risen from two to up to 40 after lockdown measures were eased last week. The officer, who was returning home after a night shift, was not confident that social distancing measures could be met if passenger numbers rise further. ""For some people it's just like a normal day, people have got fed up with [coronavirus], they've had enough,"" he said. People in England who are allowed to return to work have been asked not to use public transport if possible. People in Waleshave been told to avoid public transportwhere possible, and areduced timetable,externalwill remain in place on Transport for Wales rail services. Limited public transport services are running in Scotland,externalfor people who absolutely need to get to workand the situation is similar in Northern Ireland.,external Transport for London (TfL) said it was introducing one-way systems, safety signs and announcements, and hand sanitiser dispensers to help people to keep to social distancing measures in the capital. TfL says it will regularly update guidance on the20 busiest stations,externalto help people to avoid those areas. TfL reveals 20 busiest stations 'to avoid' Tube trains are being cleaned with anti-viral disinfectant, througout the pandemic The capital's public transport network has spoken to about 300 businesses and Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has indicated that office start times would be staggered to manage demand on public transport. Meanwhile London's congestion charge, which was suspended in March, has been reintroduced. Gates will be used to prevent people from entering stations if it becomes too busy Staff often outnumber passengers here at Euston station. British Transport Police officers and security guards are on duty, in case there are crowds. Every so often dozens of people stream off a platform when a train arrives into London. However it's still incredibly quiet. Yellow gates, which are folded-away, are dotted around. They could be used to close entrance points to the station or specific platforms if there are too many people. There is hand sanitiser on offer in the centre of the concourse. It's weird for station managers to be pleased that there aren't many passengers - but that's the situation here this morning. During the crisis the government is covering the losses made by train companies, which saw revenues evaporate when travel restrictions began. But industry forecasting predicts that significant passenger numbers will return several weeks from now. RISK AT WORK:How exposed is your job? SCHOOLS:When will children be returning? EXERCISE:What are the guidelines on getting out? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area?

"A law to introduce a new post-Brexit immigration system for the UK has been given initial approval by MPs. The immigration bill repeals EU freedom of movement and introduces the new framework - though not exact details - for who can come to live in the UK. Home Secretary Priti Patel said the government's plans will lead to a ""high skill"" economy. But critics said the coronavirus pandemic has changed public attitudes towards those considered ""unskilled"". The House of Commons approved the general principles of the law by 351 votes to 252 on Monday. It will now go on to receive further scrutiny. The legislation will put EU and European Economic Area (EEA) citizens on an equal footing to immigrants from outside the bloc. It also paves the way for the government to introduce a new points-based system, which some say will affect the ability of care workers to come to the UK. Eight ways new immigration laws will affect industry What's a skilled worker? And other immigration questions No visas for low-skilled workers, government says The government announced proposals for the new system, suggesting points will be awarded for being able to speak English to a certain standard, having a job offer from an approved employer, and meeting a salary threshold of Â£25,600. Other points could be awarded for certain qualifications and if there is a shortage in a particular occupation. Speaking in the Commons, shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said the earnings of frontline workers do not reflect their contribution to society. ""Those who clapped [for carers] on Thursday are only too happy to vote through a bill that will send a powerful message to those same people - that they are not considered by this government to be skilled workers,"" he said. ""Are shop workers unskilled? Are refuse collectors? Are local government workers? Are NHS staff? Are care workers? Of course they are not,"" he said. The Scottish government's immigration minster, Ben Macpherson, has also written to Ms Patel, asking her to ""pause and reconsider"" the plans, saying the coronavirus outbreak has highlighted the need for immigration in frontline services. Introducing the bill in the Commons, the home secretary said: ""The current crisis has shone a light on how we value those who provide compassionate care across health and social care."" Ms Patel said the changes in the bill ""will play a vital role in our recovery plans for the future"". ""It will end free movement and pave the way for a firmer, fairer and simpler system and will attract people we need to drive our country through the recovery stage of coronavirus, laying the foundation of a high wage, high skill productive economy,"" she said. The legislation, the Immigration and Social Security Co-ordination (EU Withdrawal) Bill was first introduced in December 2018, but stalled amid a series of defeats for then PM Theresa May's minority government. The bill is now being reintroduced to the Commons with Boris Johnson's 80-seat majority, meaning it is likely to pass. The plan for a new points-based system will need to be separately approved by Parliament, and it is not clear how soon the formal changes to the current rules will come before MPs. Karolina Gerlich arrived in UK from Poland 12 years ago and has been working in the social care sector ever since. She now works as the executive director of the Care Workers Charity, but says the points-based system the government plans to bring in would have ruled her out from coming to the country ""and supporting as many people as I have"". Ms Gerlich tells the BBC she is ""angry"" about the proposals, saying: ""I think it's terribly heart-breaking that there is this level of misunderstanding about the importance of what care workers do, and the contribution that social care makes, both to the economy and to society in general."" She says the sector is ""quite heavily dependent"" on foreign workers, and limiting who can come to the UK based on their wages could be ""disastrous"", especially after the coronavirus outbreak. ""We've had over 130 care workers die because they were working on the front line,"" says Ms Gerlich. ""And it is going to be more difficult for the sector to recruit after the crisis. With so many people dying, why would anybody dream of going into work in care now?"" In February, Ms Patel said people applying to come to the UK under the proposed system will need to meet strict skills criteria. ""We will no longer have the routes for cheap, low-skilled labour that obviously has dominated immigration and our labour market for far too long in this country,"" she said. This video can not be played Priti Patel: No more routes for cheap, low-skilled labour A YouGov opinion poll commissioned by the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (JCWI) suggests 54% of people now support looser immigration controls for workers regarded as essential during the pandemic. The government list of critical workers during the crisis includes care staff, food processing staff, supermarket workers, and delivery drivers. JCWI's Satbir Singh said such workers ""are not 'unskilled' or unwelcome, they are the backbone of our country and they deserve the security of knowing that this place can be their home too"". Former immigration minister and Tory MP Caroline Nokes called for ""a more nuanced and intelligent discussion about immigration in this country"". She told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""We need to understand [immigration legislation] needs to be done with compassion and understandingâ¦and we need to move away from the really blunt 'skilled' and 'unskilled' terms. ""To be quite frank, they are meaningless and actually really rude to those people who we have been so reliant on, not just in the last eight weeks, but for a very, very long time in this country. "" SNP immigration spokesman Stuart C McDonald criticised the bill, claiming it would ""split even more families apart"". ""It's a bill that will result in many thousands of EU nationals losing their rights in this country overnight and which will extend the reach of the hostile environment still further,"" he said.

"The Archbishop of Canterbury has warned cuts to public spending after coronavirus ""would be catastrophic"". The Most Reverend Justin Welby called for politicians to be ""brave and courageous"" as they sought to deal with the economic and social consequences of the lockdown. In response to spiralling public debt he said ""going for austerity again would be the most terrible mistake"". Estimates suggest the crisis could cost up to Â£298bn for this financial year. The Office for Budget Responsibility which keeps tabs on government spending,made the estimate for the figure for the final bill, for April 2020 to April 2021. The prime minister reportedly told backbench Conservative MPs on Friday there was ""no question"" of cutting public sector pay. Boris Johnson has previously insisted the costs of the crisis would not mean a fresh round of austerity, saying: ""That will certainly not be part of our approach."" Will coronavirus mean I have to pay more tax? Government faces WW2-sized bill for tackling virus Coronavirus 'could cost global economy $8.8tn' Mr Welby, who worked as an oil executive before being ordained, was speaking to the BBC ahead of Mental Health Awareness Week. He called on government ministers to invest in mental health services and for a royal commission to be set up on social care. ""Borrowing costs are the lowest they've ever been in our entire history. Spending money on mental health will have a positive rate of return,"" he said. ""We can do it now in a way we've never been able to [before]. We must be brave and courageous in setting our vision for what society will be."" He went on: ""Just because we're in the middle of a crisis, it doesn't mean that we can't have a vision for a future where justice and righteousness are the key stones of our common life. ""So we fund mental health; we have a commission of inquiry into what we learn from this - not to blame, but to learn; we have a royal commission on how we look after social care."" This video can not be played The BBC's Andrew Marr asked the archbishop what it was like to deliver an Easter sermon from his kitchen Mr Welby has spoken openly of his own mental health struggles. Herevealed he was suffering from depression last yearin a Thought for the Day broadcast on BBC Radio 4's Today programme and separately said he was taking anti-depressants. Speaking this week to the BBC's religion editor Martin Bashir, he described ""an overwhelming sense the world is getting more and more difficult and gloomy"". Explaining how his own mental health has affected his behaviour, he said: ""You turn inwards on yourself a lot. You become, frankly, narcissistic. And when you have good friends or family who spot it, they can say 'might it not be an idea to talk to someone'. Which I did."" He added: ""There is nothing pathetic about it. It is no more pathetic than being ill in any other way. And we just need to get over that."" RISK AT WORK:How exposed is your job? SCHOOLS:When will children be returning?

""As we will see as the recession takes hold, loss, grief, and anxiety are traumas. And trauma has to be gone through. You can't do it just with the stiff upper lip."" He said the whole country had been ""compulsorily fasting"" and that had caused ""huge suffering"" for many. Asked what how he hoped Britain would recover after the coronavirus crisis, he said: ""We don't do it with austerity. We don't do it with class fighting. We do it with community and the common good. And we're not afraid of spending money that will produce a better society."" The archbishop has chosen to repeat a theme that runs through his book ""Dethroning Mammon"" published four years ago: that wealth is not an idol to be worshipped but an asset to be deployed for the benefit of all people. He's likely to enrage some politicians who will dismiss his remarks as irresponsible and failing to acknowledge the damaging effect of large deficits. But he does have particular insights into the impact of austerity - with the Church of England educating one in five primary school children, running vast numbers of food banks and engaged in a range of social projects that seek to support the young and the old in deprived and disadvantaged areas of the country. It is why he believes the burden of rebuilding post-pandemic Britain must not ""fall upon the shoulders of those who are already turning up at food banks"".

"Japan has fallen into recession for the first time since 2015 as the financial toll of the coronavirus continues to escalate. The world's third biggest economy shrank at an annual pace of 3.4% in the first three months of 2020. The coronavirus is wreaking havoc on the global economy withan estimated cost of up to $8.8tn (Â£7.1tn). Last week, Germany slipped into recession as more major economies face the impact of sustained lockdowns. Japan did not go into full national lockdown, but issued a state of emergency in April which severely affected supply chains and businesses in the trade-reliant nation. Coronavirus pushes German economy into recession What shape will the coronavirus recession be? Coronavirus 'could cost global economy $8.8tn' The 3.4% fall in growth domestic product (GDP) for the first three months of 2020, follows a 6.4% decline during the last quarter of 2019, pushing Japan into a technical recession. Consumers in Japan have been hit by the dual impact of the coronavirus and a sales tax hike to 10% from 8% in October. While Japan has lifted the state of emergency in 39 out of its 47 prefectures, the economic outlook for this current quarter is equally gloomy. Analysts polled by Reuters expect the country's economy to shrink 22% during the April-to-June period, which would be its biggest decline on record. The Japanese government has already announced a record $1 trillion stimulus package, and the Bank of Japan expanded its stimulus measures for the second straight month in April. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has pledged a second budget later this month to fund fresh spending measures to cushion the economic blow of the pandemic. Japan faces a unique challenge as its economy has been stagnant for decades, compared to the more buoyant economies of rivals the US and China. Japan also relies heavily on exporting its goods and has little control over consumer demand in other countries, which has been severely impacted by coronavirus lockdowns. Many of its biggest brands, such as car firms Toyota and Honda, have seen sales slump across the world. Tourism, which has long been a boost to the Japanese economy, has also been hit hard as the pandemic keeps foreign visitors away. Japan has had more than 16,000 confirmed coronavirus cases and around 740 deaths. Things look bleak for the Japanese economy in the short term, along with other major economies around the world. But despite being the first of the world's top three economies to officially fall into recession, the country actually appears to be doing better, or less badly, than other major economies. While economists predict Japan's economy will shrink at an annual pace of  22% in the April-to-June period, they also predict that the US could contract by more than 25%. The 3.4% annual rate of decline in the first quarter also compares favourably to the 4.8% the US suffered in the first three months of this year. This was the sharpest decline for the US economy, the world's biggest, since the Great Depression of the 1930s. China, the world's second largest economy, saw economic growth shrink 6.8% in the first three months of 2020 compared with a year earlier, its first quarterly contraction since records began. Both of those economies have not yet been confirmed as having fallen into a technical recession, which is defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth, but most economists expect them to in the coming months.

Celtic captain Scott Brown has sprouted a head of hair in time to celebrate another title It's been another eventful, landmark day in Scottish football, with Celtic crowned league champions and Hearts relegated from the top flight after the Scottish Professional Football League board agreed toend the Premiership season. As Celtic fans on the whole heeded club calls not to celebrate at the club's stadium, chief executive Peter Lawwell said""no-one can deny""that Neil Lennon's team, who were 13 points clear of Rangers when the Covid-19 crisis halted fixtures, deserve to win their ninth title in a row. However, Hearts, who were four points behind Hamilton Academical,have left the door opento a possible legal challenge. Club chair Ann Budge was last week given approval to work on a proposal for temporary league reconstruction, which would involve expanding the top flight, and Hearts today said they hope this will ""avoid the need to go down"" the legal route.

So says Alex Mackie, founder of the Foundation of Hearts, which has helped finance the Edinburgh club. Celtic have also been declared champions and Mackie tells BBC Radio Scotland:""The probability that Celtic would have won the league is medium to
high, but the probability that we would have been relegated was not certain at all. ""There were eight games to go and we could have clawed our way
back."" Hearts owner Ann Budge has been given approval by the Scottish Professional Football League to come up with a reconstruction plan and Mr Mackie adds: ""We need to re-imagine the future and I am pretty certain the fans want reconstruction and the players want it too.""

Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab leads today's UK government briefing At the UK government briefing Gary Gibbon, from Channel 4, suggests the timetable for the tracing app has ""slipped somewhat"" and the length of time it is taking to return test results is also holding the UK back. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab says it is a perfectly reasonable question and the UK will be ""learning lessons"" as the tracing process unfolds. He insists the process is ""proceeding at pace"". Dr Van-Tam is more candid, saying the ""timeliness"" of tests must be improved, adding that the UK is testing to protect people and increase understanding of the virus ""and not for the hell of it"". ""We need to do it bigger and faster and we need to do it as fast as possible."" Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor Is

been the same amount of transparency around local authority care homes from the Scottish government as from the independent sector. He argues this means 20% of care homes in Scotland â the proportion
run by councils â are being judged by a different system with a different level of scrutiny. Mr Kilgour also tells Drivetime Renaissance Careâs last audited
figures show a turnover of Â£21m, with Â£1m of pre-tax profit. He said it needed to
profit around 6-7% because of tax and bank debt. He says local authorities paid the independent sector less
than what it takes to look after a person in their own care homes. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland The success of a vaccine against Covid-19 depends on the virus staying stable and not mutating, Scotland's national clinical director, Prof Jason Leitch, explains. ""Vaccines are not this huge panacea - they are not 100% reliable,"" he admits on BBC Radio Scotland. ""The problem with the flu one is that the flu virus notoriously is tricky to pin down - we don't know which one we are going to get come each December. ""Measles vaccine is, on the other hand, very reliable. Same virus, hasn't mutated, we know when it's coming. ""We are hoping that the coronavirus will be the same and it won't do something weird and that, in a year's time, it doesn't look different. All of the science so far suggests that this coronavirus is pretty stable genetically. ""So we are hopeful that, of the 300 vaccine trials that are going across the world just now, one or two of them will be successful going into the turn of the year, the start of next year.""

At the UK government briefing the BBC's Fergus Walsh asks whether the UK was slow to include loss of taste and smell (anosmia) as one of the official symptoms to watch out for in coronavirus cases, given that France identified it at the start of March. How many extra deaths may have been avoided if it had been done so earlier, he asks. In response, Dr Van-Tam said the decision to list anosmia as one of the symptoms to look out for had only been done following ""painstaking"" and thorough scientific research. He says it is a complicated process, given people display various symptoms at different times during the illness. He says the number of people displaying loss of taste and smell without any other symptoms is ""very small"", as a proportion of overall cases, and scientists had to decide how much of a difference it would make to the overall treatment. He ends by referring to early research suggesting less than 0.5% of those who have died have displayed anosmia. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Scotland's health boards will step in to help care homes who are left short of staff struck down by Covid-19, national clinical director Prof Jason Leitch has vowed. Prof Leitch tells BBC Radio Scotland that the NHS will be able to help because parts of its own service have been suspended because of the coronavirus outbreak. Drivetime's John Beattie asks about reports that some care home staff are terrified to be absent because of low pay and would knowingly continue working with symptoms. ""The salaries and economics of care home development are a step above my pay grade,"" Prof Leitch replies. ""But let me be abundantly clear - anything that stops people staying off work, if they either have symptoms and/or a positive test, is wrong and we should do everything we can - government, local government and private providers - to make that not happen."" The issue has resurfaced after the Scottish government extended the amount of testing available for care home staff. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Now Netflix and Amazon are to  resume production in France, reports Variety magazine. Two big-budget films by Pathe will also resume shooting in Paris in June. Work on Amazon series ""Voltaire, Mixte"" is expected to restart in mid-July in the south of France. Netflix's ""Arsene Lupin"", which was filming at the Louvre museum in Paris, will resume in September. The French government has established a fund of â¬50 million ($54 million) for film and TV productions that have been interrupted or canceled during the pandemic. When France went into lockdown in March,a Paris street film set had to be abandoned,,externalleaving its residents in 1942 Nazi occupied France. Hope for the outcome of a US trial for a Covid-19 vaccine drove a surge in global stocks on Monday. Wall Street made large gains, with the S&P rising 3.2%, the Dow Jones 4% and the Nasdaq 2.4%. While it is hard to pinpoint an exact cause for the surge, it seems to have been boosted by an announcement from Moderna that it had seen positive results in eight people given doses in its early vaccine trials. The rallies also saw a large increase in the price of US crude oil - its biggest hike in two months - leading to a proclamation from the US president that ""oil (energy) is back!!!!"" Captain Tom Moore captured the hearts of the UK, raising more than Â£32m for charity, and now he has inspired another World War Two veteran to do the same. Private Joseph Hammond - a 95-year-old from Ghana - has set himself the challenge of walking two miles a day for a week to raise money for coronavirus charities. He hopes to raise $600,000 (Â£500,000) for frontline workers and vulnerable veterans across Africa. Private Hammond fought with the British army in Burma, in the Gold Coast Regiment of the Royal West African Frontier Force. Greece has had a total of 2,834 cases and 163 deaths from coronavirus Greece has urged the UK to exempt Greeks from a planned quarantine for arrivals to Britain. It would be in return for British people being able to enter Greece. The British government has said it will introduce a 14-day quarantine for all arrivals to the UK with the exception of Ireland from early June. But on Monday the UK transport secretary saidpeople coming from countries with low rates of infectioncould be exempted in the future. ""The kind of aggressiveness this country (the UK) is showing in making the decisions is totally understandable,"" Greek tourism minister Harris Theoharis told the BBC. ""What I can say is we think this is a time for us to start lifting restrictions, and to try and remove as many barriers as possible."" The Greek economy is heavily reliant on tourism. The EU last week promised thatEurope will have a summer tourist seasonin some form. The Greek tourism minister was speaking the BBC's Coronavirus Newscast. Listenhere  US President Donald Trump has said he is taking hydroxychloroquine in an attempt to ward off coronavirus. Trump has previously touted the malaria drug as a treatment for coronavirus, but there is scant scientific evidence it can fight off Covid-19. Clinical trials are under way to see if it is at all effective. ""I'm taking it for about a week and a half now and I'm still here, I'm still here,"" Trump told reporters on Monday. Asked what  evidence he had for he drug's positive benefits, Mr Trump said: ""Here's my evidence, I get a lot of positive calls about it."" The US coronavirus death toll has passed 90,000, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The US toll now stands 90,312 - the highest of any nation in the world. The UK has reported the second highest death toll with 34,876, followed by Italy with 32,007. France's highest administrative court has ruled the government must lift a blanket ban on meetings at places of
worship imposed as part of measures to combat the coronavirus, AFP reports. The latest rules ban all gatherings in places of worship except funerals which are limited to 20 people. The Council of State has ruled such a ban
on freedom of worship caused ""a damage that is serious and manifestly
illegal"" and is ""disproportionate in nature."" It told the government to lift
the ban within the next eight days. Tony Blair has spoken to BBC Newsnight about coronavirus and global leadership Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair has said in a BBC interview that it is right to reopen schools. Speaking amid a row about the safety of bringing teachers and children back to the classroom from 1 June, he says he believes the government's approach is based on evidence. ""I donât think they would say that theyâre putting school opening above health risks. What theyâre doing is basing it on the evidence, actually. There are countries that have reopened parts, at least, of their school system. ""If you look at all the best evidence, and my institute has assembled a lot of the different data on this, especially for younger children, the risks of transmission are actually quite low."" Blair, who runs the Tony Blair Institute For Global Change, also said he was shocked by ""the absence of global leadership"" in particular from the US. The West should ""stand together"" in a new relationship with China, he says. ""I think we need a strategic response to China, not simply ad-hoc or reactive response on individual issues or questions."" The full Newsnight interview can be seen at 22.30 BST on BBC Two Western New York is expected to begin reopening on Tuesday, according to New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. The region - which contains Niagara Falls - will join Central New York, Finger Lakes, Mohawk Valley, North County and Southern Tier in phase-one reopening. This means parts of the economy including retail, agriculture, construction and manufacturing may soon start up again. There were 106 coronavirus-related deaths yesterday in New York state, taking the total to more than 28,000. Cuomo also used his press briefing to announce that he wants professional sports teams to start competing again without fans in attendance. ""Hockey, basketball, baseball, football, whoever can reopen. We're a ready, willing and able partner,"" he said. BBC OS We spoke to three new mothers about giving birth and caring for their new child during a pandemic. Here are their stories. Brooke Young Russellis in New York City. She had her son on 12 April, and had to wear a mask while giving birth to him as she was right next to coronavirus patients in the hospital. She was initially told that her partner couldn't be with her for the birth, but then thousands signed a petition to get the hospital to reverse its decision, which it did. ""My mom hasn't met my son yet and that is traumatising for me... my family's absence feels so much stronger now because there's no way that they can be here. The fact that my mother hasn't been able to hold her grandson yet just kills me every time."" Salma Ishaqis in London. She gave birth on 10 March, at 27 weeks. Her baby is in hospital and, before lockdown, she and her husband could visit the neonatal unit 24 hours a day. ""When the lockdown came in, the hospital policies changed. In the unit I'm in, dads are not able to visit at all and mums only for two hours. ""Twice he's had to be resuscitated and having to go in by yourself, without your husband being allowed, and going and seeing your baby in an incubator, having the ventilator... I'd kind of gone into this survival mode. Now that it's been two months I've started to process it a bit more."" Vicky Kavanaghis in Dublin, and gave birth in January. ""We live very near to my in-laws and we're very lucky - they're very involved in our lives. They were able to spend a bit of time with their granddaughter before everything kicked in."" ""I always think of all the things she's missing out on. The closeness she should have had with her grandparents. ""There's this whole chapter of her life that only me and her father have witnessed and it's been very isolating for the three of us going through that."" You can listen to the full story here. South Sudan's Vice President Riek Machar and his wife Angelina Teny, the country's defence minister, have tested positive for coronavirus. Machar, who is in his late 60s, was tested on 13 May after one of the members of the government 's Covid-19 task force tested positive. He says he has no symptoms and will self-isolate for the next 14 days. A number of Macharâs bodyguards and staff have also been found positive. South Sudan has recorded 236 cases of the virus, while four people have died.

Ray McDermott, 96, is originally from Carmarthenshire, Wales, but she has  lived in the US for 70 years. She worried she would never speak Welsh again after her mother died four decades ago. ""I don't think I'll ever have a chance to speak Welsh again,"" she recently told her son Keith. Worried about his mum's loneliness and memory-loss, Keith put out a call on social media for Welsh speakers. Within 30 minutes, he was deluged with responses. One of those who responded was Melisa Annis - a director and playwright originally from Cardiff but living in New York. She gave Ray a call. ""It's a very hard time at the moment and we are all feeling a little bit isolated and especially if you are older. I thought, 'Why not reach out?' I am a fluent Welsh speaker and very pro the Welsh language,"" Melisa said. Ray's first words in Welsh, after 40 years, were: ""I used to talk in Welsh with my mum."" Read the full story here. In Rome, Italy, a limit on the number of people allowed on trains have been introduced With lockdowns easing across much of Europe and the US, and some sectors returning to work, you might be wondering how safe  public transport is. Many cities are urging commuters to cycle or walk instead of catching a bus or train, but in some cases, there is no other option. A lot of the potential risk of infection on trains and buses depends on how crowded they are, and how far away you can keep from other people. Ventilation also plays an important role as fresh air can help droplets containing the virus dissipate faster. In the UK, the advice for people taking public transport incudes: Read more about the infection risks on public transport.

Work on a coronavirus vaccine has been taking place at unprecedented speed Earlier we reported about a promising early trial for a Covid-19 vaccine produced by Moderna Inc. Share prices in the US pharmaceutical company have shot up. Now, here's some more information about what the vaccine trials have found. In the first eight people who took part in Moderna Inc's trials, antibodies were found that can neutralise coronavirus. Even people taking the lowest dose of the trial vaccine produced antibodies at the same levels seen in patients who recover from Covid-19. But there is still some way to go. Testing for these neutralising antibodies has only taken place on the first eight, out of 45, people on the trial. And it will take larger trials to see if people are protected against the virus. Our Health Correspondent James Gallagher has been delving more deeply into this development. Read more here.  Have you heard the one about the priest who set up a drive-through holy water shooting gallery? Father Tim Pelc, of St Ambrose Parish in Michigan, became a hit online after he came up with a novel solution to blessing church-goers during the coronavirus pandemic. ""You can't double dip into the holy water container,"" he told Today in the US. ""I thought, what could I do that would keep the quarantine restrictions going and give kids the experience of Easter?"" He fired the holy weapon at Easter, but a tweet showing this social distancing solution has now been liked more than 570,000 times. It has even inspired parody art, such as the following effort from Redditor Tomdoerr88: A man desperate to hug his grandmother while protecting her from possible infection has come up with what has been dubbed the ""cuddle curtain"". Footage of the pair enjoying a long-awaited hug has been viewed millions of times on social media. Based on a plastic shower curtain and featuring disposable gloves, it was created by Antony Cauvin, from Stratford-upon-Avon in England. He said he had been thinking about the problem for some time. Despite the easing of some lockdown measures in England, the government is still asking people to avoid meeting up with more than one person at a time from a different household and to maintain a gap of at least two metres at all times.

The latest job cuts come after plans to cut 3,700 jobs were announced earlier this month, meaning around a quarter of the company's jobs will be lost. The workforce cuts do not include drivers, whom Uber considers independent contractors. Uber said it would reorganise its remaining staff and cut back spending in areas that are not part of its core personal transport or food delivery businesses, including its AI Labs. The number of Uber rides dropped 80% around the world last month as the company was hit by coronavirus restrictions. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The number of children crossing the Channel in dinghies is rising, Kent County Council says The number of unaccompanied child migrants arriving in Kent has risen significantly in the past 12 months, the county council leader has said. Roger Gough claimed the number of young asylum seekers in the county had ""doubled in a little more than a year"". A drop in lorries crossing the Channel due to coronavirus had caused a rise in children arriving in dinghies, he said. It has led to fears children are being trafficked into modern slavery, the Immigration Services Union said. When asylum-seeking children arrive unaccompanied in Kent, usually at Dover, they are passed into the care of the county council. There were 450 child migrants in the council's care at the end of April, compared with 257 in April 2019. Volunteers say between 100 and 200 migrant children are camped in Calais About 20 childrenarrived in small boats over the bank holiday weekend, Mr Gough said. While stowing away on lorries had until recently been the ""typical route for a young person,"" he said they were ""to a large degree now coming in the boats"". ""What we are now seeing, particularly as you can imagine all the changes with lockdowns across Europe and a significant reduction in freight transport, is that actually the boats are becoming a route for those unaccompanied asylum-seeking children."" The increase in new arrivals was putting ""severe and growing pressure"" on the council's finances and social care services, he said. Lucy Moreton, of the Immigration Services Union, said the age of children arriving unaccompanied ""does appear to be dropping"" and fears the journeys may be the result of human trafficking. Smugglers usually charged between Â£5,000 to Â£10,000 per head, she said, adding: ""Unaccompanied children do not have the financial resources to do this."" Ms Moreton fears organised crime groups may be ""bringing the children here for the purposes of modern slavery or sexual slavery"". Newly-arrived children must be watched closely by social services and not allowed to ""vanish"", as has sometimes happened with older children in the past, Ms Moreton said. Personal hygiene in migrant camps had deteriorated, charities say Volunteers have said conditions in makeshift migrant camps in northern France have deteriorated during the pandemic because of a reduction in charities working in the area. Care4Calais volunteer Tia Bush said there were between 100 and 200 children living in Calais, who were mostly unaccompanied. ""The problem is the conditions have got so bad here with the virus that obviously people are more desperate to get to the UK,"" she said. ""They are not safe here, so they have nothing to lose,"" she said. A Home Office spokesman said: ""The government takes the welfare of unaccompanied children very seriously and provides funding to local authorities, including Kent, as a contribution to the cost of supporting unaccompanied children and those who leave care."" It said it was working to dismantle the ""ruthless criminal gangs put people's lives in grave danger"". RISK AT WORK:How exposed is your job? SCHOOLS:When will children be returning?
