"South Africa's president has urged everyone to get vaccinated The new coronavirus variant Omicron has now become dominant in South Africa and is driving a sharp increase in new infections, health officials say. Some 11,500 new Covid infections were registered in the latest daily figures. That is a sharp rise on the 8,500 cases confirmed the previous day. By contrast, daily infections were averaging between 200 and 300 in mid-November, a top South African scientist told the BBC. Omicron has now been detected in at least 24 countries around the world, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Those who have already had other variants of coronavirus do not appear to be protected against Omicron but vaccines are still believed to protect against severe disease, according to top scientists from the global health body and South Africa's National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD). ""Previous infection used to protect against Delta but now with Omicron that doesn't seem to be the case,"" said Anne von Gottberg, microbiologist at NICD. The full picture in South Africa will not become clear until ""people get so sick that they need to go to hospital"" which is generally ""three, four weeks later,"" says Prof Salim Abdool Karim of the Africa Task Force for Coronavirus. ""But the feedback we're getting from the ground is that there's really no red flags - we're not seeing anything dramatically different, what we're seeing is what we are used to,"" he told the BBC's Newsday programme. The BBC's Pumza Fihlani in South Africa's biggest city, Johannesburg, says that restaurants and supermarkets remain packed, ahead of the Christmas and New Year holidays. People are talking about the new variant - but so far there's little panic and, according to scientists, there shouldn't be. How can I tell I have Omicron? Covid map: Where are cases the highest? South Africa was the first country to report on the highly mutated new variant. The NICD says more than 70% of all the virus genomes it sequenced last month have been of the new variant. India, Ghana, Saudi Arabia and the UAE are among the latest countries to have confirmed their first cases of Omicron. Others including the UK, US and Germany have also seen people infected by the new variant. Many questions about Omicron remain to be answered, including how much protection current vaccines provide. The WHO has categorised it as a ""variant of concern"", and says early evidence suggests it has a higher re-infection risk. Earlier this week, countries around the world restricted travel from southern Africa as details of the spread emerged. This prompted South Africa's foreign ministry to complain that it wasbeing punished - instead of applauded - for discovering Omicron. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus later warned that blanket Covid measures were penalising southern Africa. The rate of new infection is expected to increase in what is now the beginning of the fourth wave in South Africa, and the national health department says there has also been a slight increase in hospital admissions. This video can not be played Omicron symptoms mild so far, says South African doctor who spotted it Most of the people who have been hospitalised in South Africa had not been vaccinated against coronavirus, according to the NICD. There are no vaccine shortages in the country, and Mr Ramaphosa has urged more people to get jabbed, saying this remains the best way to fight the virus. About 24% of South Africans have so far been fully vaccinated - far more than the 7% average recorded across the African continent, but lower than the latest European average of 54%. Officials in South Africa are ramping up efforts to get more people vaccinated. Before the detection of the Omicron variant late last month, vaccination campaigns had stalled, in part because of the low rate of reported new infections, experts say. But our South Africa reporter says that seems to be changing - on 25 November about 120,000 vaccines were administered and a week later the number had risen to just over 160,000 new vaccinations a day. It could be the silver lining that health officials were hoping for, she says. What this means for the rest of the world remains very uncertain. South Africa had a wave driven by another variant - Beta -  that did not take off in other places. Levels of a later variant, Delta, were very low when Omicron took hold in South Africa - meaning the new variant did not have to work hard to compete. South Africa has low levels of vaccination although it has had high levels of infection and that brings its own immunity. How it fares in places like the UK, where there is plenty of Delta circulating but the population is heavily vaccinated, therefore, remains to be seen. Is low vaccination a factor in the rise of Omicron?

"Jurors held a minute's silence for Arthur Labinjo-Hughes after they returned their verdicts A father and his partner have been found guilty of the killing of six-year-old Arthur Labinjo-Hughes. The boy was tortured by Thomas Hughes and Emma Tustin, eventually dying of a head injury in Solihull in June 2020 while in the care of his stepmother. Tustin shook him and banged his head on a hard surface after poisoning him with salt, the court heard. At Coventry Crown Court, Tustin was convicted of murder and Hughes found guilty of manslaughter. The pair were also convicted of child cruelty charges. Emma Tustin was convicted of Arthur's murder while his father, Thomas Hughes, found guilty of his manslaughter Following the verdicts the jury asked if they could hold a minute's silence for Arthur, which they were allowed to do. They were also excused from sitting on another jury for life. They heard weeks of harrowing evidence, including how Arthur was force-fed salt-laced meals, kept isolated in the home, starved, dehydrated and routinely beaten. He was forced to ""stand like a statue"" near the front door of Tustin's home for hour after hour, and on another occasion his father cut up two of his Birmingham City shirts as punishment. Arthur Labinjo-Hughes: A life cut short by cruelty Boy cried 'no-one loves me' before death Six-year-old appeared skeletal Jurors, who took six hours and 15 minutes to return their verdicts, were also shown and listened to hours and hours worth of audio and video clips recorded in the final weeks of Arthur's life, including CCTV from an in-lounge camera on the morning before he was fatally injured, where he appeared to limp and cry, and struggled to fold up a duvet he had been given to sleep on downstairs. This video can not be played Emma Tustin lies to police, saying Arthur Labinjo-Hughes was responsible for his own injuries In one audio clip, Arthur could be heard crying ""no-one loves me,"" repeating the phrase four times, while in another he cries ""no-one's gonna feed me"" seven times. Arthur was ""scarcely able to articulate his words"" and could no longer support his own weight by the time of his murder. Arthur's biological mother had herself been jailed for stabbing her own partner to death. Hughes and Olivia Labinjo-Halcrow had shared custody of their son until her arrest for killing 29-year-old delivery driver Gary Cunningham in their home at Frensham Way, Birmingham, in February 2019. Video was shown to the court of Arthur struggling to pick up his pillow and blanket at his home During Tustin's evidence, prosecutor Jonas Hankin QC said it was clear from the tone of her commands to Arthur that she had ""relished"" being cruel towards him. While Tustin was accused of carrying out the fatal assault by violently shaking him and repeatedly banging Arthur's head on a hard surface after poisoning him with a ""salt slurry"", Hughes was ""complicit in the violence,"" prosecutors had told jurors. Despite medical evidence suggesting there was no way Arthur could have self-inflicted his fatal injuries, Tustin maintained she was not responsible. She took a photograph of Arthur on her mobile phone as he lay dying in the hallway, sending the image to Hughes, the court heard. She then took 12 minutes to call 999, lying to medics that Arthur ""fell and banged his head and while on the floor banged his head another five times"", later claiming he must have thrown himself down the stairs, despite evidence he was barely strong enough to pick up his own bedding. An NSPCC spokesperson said the cruelty inflicted on Arthur ""almost defies belief"" Although he was not present for the fatal assault on Arthur, prosecutors argued Hughes was equally culpable as he ""encouraged"" violence against his son, as well as dealing out beatings himself. The court previously heard Hughes made a number of threats towards his son, including to ""put him six feet under"", and had also sent Tustin messages such as ""just end him"". The court also heard Arthur had told others his ""dad was going to kill him"", he expressed this to his wider family, his doctor and his school. On one occasion before his death, Arthur told his father: ""I am in danger with you, dad"". In court, the pair had been described by prosecutors as ""utterly ruthless, unthinking and pitiless"". The circumstances surrounding Arthur Labinjo-Hughes's death are truly shocking. No-one can be blamed for what happened other than the people who were supposed to be looking after him - Emma Tustin and Thomas Hughes. However, there were opportunities when - if the agencies involved had intervened - Arthur might have been saved. This will be the subject of a serious case review which is expected to be published next year. It's hard not to see some similarities between Arthur's case and others that I have covered, including the deaths of Daniel Pelka, Keanu Williams and Keegan Downer. After his death, Arthur was found to have 130 injuries all over his body But there is one big difference. Arthur's abuse escalated as soon as he and his father moved in with Tustin at the start of the first lockdown last year. It carried on behind closed doors at a time when everyone was isolating and face-to-face meetings were rare. The NSPCC has said it saw a 23% increase in calls at the time. It may be that lockdown might also be considered to have been a factor in the little boy's death. Speaking after the verdicts, Arthur's maternal grandmother, Madeleine Halcrow, called them ""wicked"" and ""evil"" and described their behaviour as ""unfathomable"". ""I think they are cold, calculating, systematic torturers of a defenceless little boy. They're wicked, evil. There's no word for them, especially your own child,"" she said. Det Insp Laura Harrison of West Midlands Police said it was not clear why Tustin and Hughes caused Arthur so much harm and suffering or why they installed a CCTV camera in their home, but it proved invaluable in showing what his life was like. She added they found no evidence of a space in the house Arthur ""could have called his own"". ""Officers found his duvet shoved in a cupboard under the stairs, because he was made to sleep on the floor in the living room each night."" This video can not be played Arthur Labinjo-Hughes: Grandmother pays tribute to boy, six Tustin, of Cranmore Road in Shirley, had admitted two counts of child cruelty which accused her of intimidation and assaults but denied a third count alleging she poisoned Arthur with salt-laced drinks and meals. Hughes, 29, was also convicted of the cruelty offences which Tustin had admitted but cleared of withholding food and drink, or of poisoning his own son with salt. It emerged at trial that Arthur had been seen by social workers just two months before his death, after concerns were raised by his paternal grandmother Joanne Hughes, but they concluded there were ""no safeguarding concerns"". An independent review is now under way into the authorities' contact with Arthur before his death. An NSPCC spokesperson said the cruelty inflicted ""almost defies belief"", adding their convictions must be the start of a process to ""uncover the chain of events"" and ""establish what lessons need to be learned"". The pair will be sentenced on Friday at Coventry Crown Court. If you have been affected by the issues raised in this article, help and support is availablevia BBC Action Line.

"Siccar Point Energy says it will continue talks with the UK Government over the future of the field Oil giant Shell has pulled out of the controversial Cambo oil field development west of Shetland. The company had a 30% stake in the field, which hasfaced sustained criticism from environmental groups. Shell said the economic case for investment in the North Atlantic project was ""not strong enough"". Majority stakeholder Siccar Point Energy said it would continue talks with the UK government over the future of the field. Shell said it had carried out ""comprehensive screening"" before reaching a decision to ""ensure the best returns for the business"". Is a new oil field climate change hypocrisy? Sturgeon urges PM to reassess Cambo oil field plan A spokesperson said: ""The economic case for investment in this project is not strong enough at this time, as well as having the potential for delays. ""However, continued investment in oil and gas in the UK remains critical to the country's energy security. ""We believe the North Sea - and Shell in it - has a critical role to play in the UK's energy mix, supporting the jobs and skills to enable a smooth transition to Britain's low-carbon future."" The Cambo oil field is situated approximately 125km (75 miles) to the west of Shetland in water depths of between 1,050m (3,445ft) and 1,100m (3,609ft). It was originally licensed for exploration in 2001 and could yield hundreds of millions of barrels of oil. If approved by the Oil and Gas Authority, drilling could start as early as 2022 - and continue for 25 years. Project leader Siccar Point Energy said the development ""remains critical"" to the UK's economy and energy security. CEO Jonathan Roger said:  ""Whilst we are disappointed at Shell's change of position, we remain confident about the qualities of a project. ""It will not only create over 1,000 direct jobs as well as thousands more in the supply chain, but also help ease the UK's transition to a low carbon future through responsibly produced domestic oil. ""Given Shell's decision, we are now in discussions with our contractors, supply chain and wider stakeholders to review options."" This puts the Cambo oil field in serious doubt but despite the predictions of environmentalists, it doesn't yet kill it off. It's clear from reading between the lines that it's becoming too much of a reputational liability for Shell. But the majority of the North Sea is no longer operated by the traditional big oil and gas giants. Investors - whose driver is the bottom line - are playing an increasing role. And that means that if the sums work as they still might, someone else could still swoop in to take Shell's share. Trade body OGUK said investor confidence in oil and gas ""remains essential"". External relations director Jenny Stanning said: ""This is a commercial decision between partners, but doesn't change the facts that the UK will need new oil and gas projects if we are to avoid increasing reliance on imports."" But climate campaigners said Shell's announcement signalled ""the beginning of the end"" for new oil and gas projects. Friends of the Earth Scotland's Caroline Rance said: ""People power has made the Cambo development so toxic that even oil giant Shell doesn't want to be associated with it. ""Both the UK and Scottish Governments must now officially reject Cambo, say no to any future oil and gas developments in UK waters and get on with planning a fair and fast transition for people working in this industry."" The Scottish government says unlimited extraction of fossil fuels goes against its climate obligations Last month First Minister Nicola Sturgeonsaid Cambo ""should not get the green light"". She had previously called for the development to be reassessed, but had stopped short of opposing it outright. But she told MSPs: ""I don't think we can go on extracting oil and gas forever, and I don't think we can continue to give the go-ahead to new oil fields."" The decision on whether drilling gets the go-ahead rests with UK authorities. The UK government said that despite moves to renewable energy sources, ""there will continue to be ongoing demand for oil and gas over the coming years"". The Scottish government said that unlimited extraction of fossil fuels is ""not consistent with our climate obligations"". A spokesperson added: ""We continue to call on the UK Government, who have the power to act in this instance, to urgently re-assess all approved oil licenses where drilling has not yet commenced against our climate commitments.""

"Thousands of people are still without power in Scotland and northern England, six days after Storm Arwen hit the UK. About 16,000 homes did not have electricity, Boris Johnson said, with the majority expected to have supply restored by the end of the week. Amajor incident has been declared in County Durham, meaning extra support can be provided to the thousands of people still without power. Three people died as the storm brought high winds and cold weather on Friday. Among them was 35-year-oldDavid Lapage, who died after his truck was struck by a falling treein Aberdeenshire. More than 50 rare trees toppled in Storm Arwen Stranded Tally the turtle begins its recovery Downing Street has said it is in ""hourly contact"" with network operators and is working urgently to ensure welfare and shelter is provided to those who need it. The prime minister said about120 military personnel were being drafted in to help the recovery effortin the Grampian region of Scotland. Mr Johnson said:  ""It was a very, very big storm. We are doing everything we can to to help people."" He said that while there had been about 19,000 homes without power on Thursday morning about 3,000 had now had electricity restored. ""That is no consolation for the 16,000 who are still suffering but we are working flat out to help you,"" he added. Welfare centres have been set up and in some cases energy suppliers have found emergency accommodation and provided generators and food vans to support communities without power. Butsome residents have criticised utility companiesfor ""woeful"" communication and have said they feel forgotten. Some properties - particularly in remote areas - may not get electricity before Saturday, energy suppliers have warned. Sara Stanley said she was unable to leave her home for a hotel as she was self-isolating with Covid Durham County Council said the decision to declare a major incident had been made as Northern Powergrid was ""not yet in a position to confirm when supplies will be reinstated to all properties"". It means additional support from the council and emergency services will be made available to people hit by a loss of power. Laura and David Venner have been temporarily housed in a Newcastle hotel with their four children - three of whom are disabled - since Sunday, after losing power at their home. ""It was absolutely freezing,"" Mrs Venner said. ""I broke down at 6am and said 'we've got to leave.'"" Cold temperatures could make their children ""seriously ill"", she said, adding that while they were grateful being in a hotel was ""far from ideal"" as they were unable to bring medical equipment their children needed. Their power was restored on Thursday and Mrs Venner said it felt like a ""massive Christmas present that's just come early"" to be able to get back to normality. ""Electricity, warmth and lighting everybody takes for granted every day. We've been without, I really won't take it for granted any more,"" she said. Sara Stanley, from Medburn in Northumberland, told BBC News she had been without power until Tuesday when, after pressure from residents, a generator was provided for her estate. She said it had been ""a bit grim"" as she had tested positive for Covid and thought she would have ended up in hospital if not for the generator. She said the initial advice had been to go to a hotel or stay with relatives - but she was not able to as she was required to self-isolate. Linda Dunk said she expected more power cuts over the winter due to damage to infrastructure Linda Dunk had the power restored to her Aberdeenshire home on Thursday afternoon after six days without heating, light or water. She told BBC News they were going to get a generator as she thought the infrastructure had been so badly damaged there may be more problems later this winter. ""I don't want to spend another six days like this, I'm too old,"" she said. ""I want to go to bed not worrying about these sorts of things."" Tony and Nicola Hills from Kirkby Lonsdale, Cumbria, have had to move out as they and their five children were ""struggling to keep warm, washed and properly fed"". In a letter to his MP Mr Hills described Electricity North West's call centres and IT systems as ""woefully inadequate"", adding that he had received a text saying they had been reconnected when they had not. Many power lines have been damaged by falling trees The ongoing efforts to restore power come as cold weather, including rain and sleet, is expected across the UK. The Met Office saidmore snow is expected to hit Scotland,externalon Friday, while rain is predicted for the north western parts. Energy suppliers have said they are working to fix power cuts but there are still outages in some areas, this includes: Northern Powergrid, which covers the North East of England, Yorkshire and north Lincolnshire, said 6,600 properties remain cut off. It had said it would not be able to restore all supplies - especially in remote areas - before the weekend Electricity North West said 2,000 customers remained without power as of 14:30 GMT on Thursday, and said they were confident no customers would be without after the weekend Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) said 3,100 customers still did not have electricity in Scotland. It said it aimed to reconnect all customers by Friday, but that some might not have it till Saturday In the south of Scotland, Scottish Power Energy Networks said it was working to restore the ""few hundred customers in the Borders without power"". The last homes in Wales that were still without power following the stormwere reconnected on Wednesday. Energy regulator Ofgem has said it willexamine the speed of energy companies' responses,externaland the resilience of the UK power network in extreme weather. Labour's shadow environment secretary Jim McMahon said the government had ""mostly abandoned"" those without power, particularly in rural and remote areas. He called for the government to ""ensure there is resilient infrastructure across the country to stand up to the more severe storms"".

"Elle has become the first major fashion publisher to pledge an end to the promotion of animal fur in its editorial and advertising content. A senior executive said it was in support of animal welfare, and a reflection of changing tastes. The magazine's 45 global editions have signed a charter written with animal rights group Humane Society and industry reform group Creatives4Change. Thirteen editions have already implemented the charter. A further 20 will join them at the start of 2022, and the remainder in 2023. Animal fur industry advocates have argued that using synthetic fur is counter-intuitive, because it is made with plastics that harm the environment. Fake fur coats are often created from polyester, which takes hundreds of years to biodegrade. ""Fur appears to be outdated and not fashionable anymore, and especially for the Gen Z, who is the golden target of fashion and luxury industry,"" said Valeria Bessolo LLopiz, Elle's international director, speaking at a conference in Oxfordshire. ""Gen Z wants fashion to be responsible, ethical and innovative, and that's what's happening,"" she added. How the pandemic is putting the spotlight on wildlife trade Founded in France in 1945, Elle is one of the world's largest fashion and lifestyle publications. Among those welcoming the decision has been animal rights charity Peta. ""Fur promotions belong only in the back copies of fashion magazines from days gone by,"" said Elisa Allen, the group's UK director. She also hailed British Vogue, InStyle USA, Cosmopolitan UK and Vogue Scandinavia's pledges to reject fur in their editorial content, and said she expected this would eventually extend to their advertising policies. Several fashion houses and retailers have ditched the use of fur and skin, citing pressure from lobbying groups and consumers. Most recently, in September, luxury group Kering announced that all of its brands would permanently stop using animal furs - four years after its star label, Gucci, made a similar move. The group's houses - including Balenciaga, Alexander McQueen and Saint Laurent - have also phased out fur in recent years.

"Reports suggesting a US decision to maintain tariffs on British steel is linked to Brexit and Northern Ireland are a ""false narrative"", trade minister Penny Mordaunt has said. She said wrangles with Brussels over the Irish border were ""entirely separate"" from trade with Washington. It comes after theFinancial Times reported,externalthe issue was stopping the UK resolving the steel row with America. The US lifted tariffs on EU steel last month but kept them on UK steel. Speaking in the Commons, Ms Mordaunt said the FT's report ""might be true in terms of how some people in the US feel, but it is a false narrative. These are two entirely separate issues."" ""We don't do ourselves any favours if we perpetuate these false narratives,"" she added. The Trump-era tariffs of 25% on steel products and 10% on aluminium were imposed on the EU in 2018, when the UK was still part of the trading bloc. The US agreed to end the duties on EU productsin the autumn, but the tariffs, which nearly halved UK steel exports to its second largest market, remain in place on British steel. NI riots: What is behind the violence in Northern Ireland? UK steel makers 'left behind' as US ends trade war The FT reported that US and UK talks to resolve the issue could not move ahead due to Washington's concerns over UK threats to trigger Article 16 of the Northern Ireland Protocol. The protocol is a clause in the Brexit deal that leaves Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods, while checks are imposed between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The idea was to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, which many feared would would have destabilised the Good Friday Agreement peace deal. But it has increased red tape on trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, and, according to unionist leaders, sparkedrioting and violencethis year in Belfast. Downing Street has threatened to trigger Article 16 to override the protocol - something Washington has warned against. Kim Darroch, a former ambassador to the US, said the reports on the ""troubled state"" of trade relations between the UK and the US are ""confirmation that the US will act to protect a peace they helped broker"" in Northern Ireland. He added that the UK was ""not going to have a thriving trade relationship with our biggest trading partner"" - the EU, nor a free trade agreement with the US, ""until the government stops threatening to walk away from an international agreement [on Northern Ireland] they negotiated and acclaimed only a few months ago"". President Biden and head of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen have both warned the UK against triggering Article 16 Chris Morris, global trade correspondent The warnings have been coming thick and fast - and publicly - for some time. Washington is not impressed by UK threats to invoke Article 16 of the Northern Ireland Protocol. That's true in the White House. It's also true within the vocal Irish lobby in the US Congress. The UK and the EU have been holding talks on the effects of the Protocol - including checks and controls on goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. The UK wants the text of the Protocol rewritten, and the Brexit Minister Lord Frost has called for more urgency in the discussion. The EU has offered a package of measures which it says would reduce checks considerably. It also argues that the UK needs to honour the agreement it signed up to, which is now part of an international treaty, rather than walk away from it. The US is backing that line. It's true that negotiations on the steel tariffs and negotiations on the NI Protocol are entirely separate processes. But political links are being made in influential quarters in Washington. The International Trade Secretary, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, will travel to the US next week for previously planned talks on the steel tariffs and other issues. But if unresolved arguments about the Protocol start to have a direct effect on other trade matters, that will be a cause for concern in London. Ms Mordaunt said that International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan would be holding talks about steel and other issues with her American counterparts next week. She also defended the UK's approach to discussions on the Northern Ireland protocol: ""We have acted in good faith. We will do more to tell America we have acted in good faith and we are determined to be pragmatic. Lord Frost [the Brexit Minister] is going to do that."" She was answering a question from the SNP MP and chair of the International Trade Committee Angus MacNeil, who said: ""Does she welcome America keeping control?"" - a reference to the Brexiteer slogan that Brexit would allow the UK to ""Take Back Control"". Earlier another International Trade Minister, Ranil Jayawardena described the punishing US steel tariffs as ""unfair and unnecessary."" ""We will continue to make representations to back British businesses,"" he said. A Department for International Trade spokesman said it welcomed the US government's willingness ""to address trade issues relating to steel and aluminium"". ""We remain focused on agreeing a resolution that sees damaging tariffs removed to the benefit of businesses on both sides of the Atlantic. ""We continue to engage closely with the administration on the Northern Ireland Protocol and we share a deep commitment to the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement and the peace process."" Gareth Stace, director general of UK Steel, a trade group, said: ""The UK's steel sector and our customers in the US urge the UK and US governments to continue to work together to find a solution to the issue of Section 232 tariffs, and to strain every sinew to do so. ""On the 1st January, steelmakers in the EU will gain a significant price advantage over their UK counterparts. ""Already, customers in the US will be factoring in January 2022 prices to their plans for the next year, which of course risks the UK sector losing market share in the US, to EU exporters.""

"Siccar Point Energy says it will continue talks with the UK Government over the future of the field Oil giant Shell has pulled out of the controversial Cambo oil field development west of Shetland. The company had a 30% stake in the field, which hasfaced sustained criticism from environmental groups. Shell said the economic case for investment in the North Atlantic project was ""not strong enough"". Majority stakeholder Siccar Point Energy said it would continue talks with the UK government over the future of the field. Shell said it had carried out ""comprehensive screening"" before reaching a decision to ""ensure the best returns for the business"". Is a new oil field climate change hypocrisy? Sturgeon urges PM to reassess Cambo oil field plan A spokesperson said: ""The economic case for investment in this project is not strong enough at this time, as well as having the potential for delays. ""However, continued investment in oil and gas in the UK remains critical to the country's energy security. ""We believe the North Sea - and Shell in it - has a critical role to play in the UK's energy mix, supporting the jobs and skills to enable a smooth transition to Britain's low-carbon future."" The Cambo oil field is situated approximately 125km (75 miles) to the west of Shetland in water depths of between 1,050m (3,445ft) and 1,100m (3,609ft). It was originally licensed for exploration in 2001 and could yield hundreds of millions of barrels of oil. If approved by the Oil and Gas Authority, drilling could start as early as 2022 - and continue for 25 years. Project leader Siccar Point Energy said the development ""remains critical"" to the UK's economy and energy security. CEO Jonathan Roger said:  ""Whilst we are disappointed at Shell's change of position, we remain confident about the qualities of a project. ""It will not only create over 1,000 direct jobs as well as thousands more in the supply chain, but also help ease the UK's transition to a low carbon future through responsibly produced domestic oil. ""Given Shell's decision, we are now in discussions with our contractors, supply chain and wider stakeholders to review options."" This puts the Cambo oil field in serious doubt but despite the predictions of environmentalists, it doesn't yet kill it off. It's clear from reading between the lines that it's becoming too much of a reputational liability for Shell. But the majority of the North Sea is no longer operated by the traditional big oil and gas giants. Investors - whose driver is the bottom line - are playing an increasing role. And that means that if the sums work as they still might, someone else could still swoop in to take Shell's share. Trade body OGUK said investor confidence in oil and gas ""remains essential"". External relations director Jenny Stanning said: ""This is a commercial decision between partners, but doesn't change the facts that the UK will need new oil and gas projects if we are to avoid increasing reliance on imports."" But climate campaigners said Shell's announcement signalled ""the beginning of the end"" for new oil and gas projects. Friends of the Earth Scotland's Caroline Rance said: ""People power has made the Cambo development so toxic that even oil giant Shell doesn't want to be associated with it. ""Both the UK and Scottish Governments must now officially reject Cambo, say no to any future oil and gas developments in UK waters and get on with planning a fair and fast transition for people working in this industry."" The Scottish government says unlimited extraction of fossil fuels goes against its climate obligations Last month First Minister Nicola Sturgeonsaid Cambo ""should not get the green light"". She had previously called for the development to be reassessed, but had stopped short of opposing it outright. But she told MSPs: ""I don't think we can go on extracting oil and gas forever, and I don't think we can continue to give the go-ahead to new oil fields."" The decision on whether drilling gets the go-ahead rests with UK authorities. The UK government said that despite moves to renewable energy sources, ""there will continue to be ongoing demand for oil and gas over the coming years"". The Scottish government said that unlimited extraction of fossil fuels is ""not consistent with our climate obligations"". A spokesperson added: ""We continue to call on the UK Government, who have the power to act in this instance, to urgently re-assess all approved oil licenses where drilling has not yet commenced against our climate commitments.""

"Germany will ban unvaccinated people from shops and bars, unless they have recently recovered from Covid Chancellor Angela Merkel says a nationwide vaccination mandate could be imposed in Germany from February 2022 The UK government signs deals to buy 114 million more doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to use in 2022 and 2023 The deals were speeded up after the Omicron variant emerged - but talks were already under way But the WHO points out that many poorer countries have still not been able to vaccinate their most vulnerable UK regulators approve new treatment that could reduce hospitalisation and death by 79% in high-risk adults Health officials say Omicron has now become dominant in South Africa and is driving a sharp increase in new infections We're pausing our live coverage of the pandemic now but we'll be back tomorrow morning. Here's a reminder of the day's main developments:  Today's live page posts were written by Jen Meierhans, Joseph Lee, Hamish Mackay, George Wright and Jack Hunter. The live page was edited by Emma Harrison and Emma Owen. Thanks for joining us.  Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter With the rise of the Omicron variant, Joe Biden is back in front of the American people later with another set of steps to stop the spread of Covid-19. Unlike hislast major action, however, the administrationâs plan is light on government mandates â perhaps a reflection of the political firestorm his previous orders created and the legal morass that has enveloped them. Instead, Biden is pushing for greater access to testing and encouraging, but not requiring, all Americans to get vaccination booster shots. He also makes specific mention of keeping schools open and children in classrooms â a reflection of the white-hot rage last yearâs extended closures generated among some suburban parents, who have become a key part of the Democratsâ electoral voting bloc. When Biden assumed the presidency earlier this year, he acknowledged the success of his tenure would be determined in large part by his ability to contain the pandemic and return a semblance of normalcy to American life. After some early positive results, the rise of new variants â along with vaccine hesitancy among some in the US â dampened those hopes and exacted an economic and political toll. Todayâs actions suggest Biden knows a return to normal is still a long way off. As we've been reporting, Germany has announced sweeping new restrictions for unvaccinated people to curb coronavirus infections. Chancellor Angela Merkel has described the measures as an ""act of national solidarity"" in response to a ""very serious"" situation in Germany. Some German states already operate so-called 2G policies - which stands for forgenesen(recovered in the past six months) orgeimpft(vaccinated). Here's what Merkel announced:  Read more about Germany's new rules here. Pilots are urging the UK government to provide specific financial support for the aviation sector due to the impact of the Omicron variant of coronavirus. Fully-vaccinated UK arrivals must self-isolate until they receive a negative result from a PCR test. And the red list has also been resurrected, with 10 southern African countries added. EasyJet said on Tuesday that it has seen demand softening due to the emergence of the new strain of Covid-19. Pilots' union Balpa is calling for the government to provide a Winter Resilience Fund to ensure cash-strapped airlines and other aviation companies survive the coming months. Balpa general secretary Martin Chalk says: ""Holiday and New Year traffic is a core part of the winter season for airlines. ""With this being severely depressed by shattered confidence and restrictions, we need winter support measures to help us weather the storm of Omicron uncertainty."" The advertising regulator has cleared Tesco's Christmas TV campaign featuring Father Christmas bearing a Covid vaccine passport after it prompted 5,000 complaints from viewers. The ad, titled This Christmas, Nothing's Stopping Us, shows the supermarket's customers determined to enjoy a proper Christmas with family and friends after last year's Covid-related restrictions. However, in one scene a reporter appears on TV with ""breaking news"", telling viewers that ""Santa could be quarantined"".
Father Christmas is then shown presenting his Covid pass at border control, proving he has been vaccinated to a customs officer so he can enter the country without restriction. Commenting on complaints that the ad is coercive and encourages medical discrimination, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) says the advert ""doesn't break our rules and there are no grounds for further action"". ""In summary, we consider that the depiction of Santa displaying a proof of vaccine status in an airport is likely to be seen as a humorous reference to international travel rules people have experienced this year; it is unlikely to be interpreted as a message about these rules or the Covid-19 vaccine more widely. ""While we understand that some people disagree with the vaccine programme and may find the ad in poor taste, we have concluded that the ad is unlikely to be seen as irresponsible or cause serious or widespread offence on the basis suggested."" As the debate over Christmas parties rumbles on (No 10 says, for now, they should take place), Transport for London (TfL) is already looking ahead to New Year's Eve. Whether Londoners will be out socialising amid the spread of Omicron remains unclear, but one thing that is certain is that free Tube travel on New Year's Eve has been scrapped for the second year in a row. This is due to the ""catastrophic impact of the pandemic"" on finances, TfL says. Normally London's Underground is free from 23:45 GMT until 04:30 GMT. Services will still run through the night but usual fares will apply. It is the second year of no free travel, but last year's celebrations were restricted due to the pandemic. This year a ticketedcelebration at Trafalgar Square replacesthe annual fireworks display on the Thames. Read the full story. Covid measures have been strengthened in response to concern over the newly identified Omicron variant. Let's have a look at what the rules are in the UK. The rules in England changed this week, meaning that face coverings are once again compulsory in shops and on public transport. Anyone entering the UK also now requires a PCR test within 48 hours of arrival and must self-isolate until they have a negative result. The 10 day self-isolation rule has also been brought in again for all contacts of suspected Omicron cases. Face coverings are already mandatory in shops, health and social care settings and on public transport in Wales. But First Minister Mark Drakeford has urged people to ""think carefully"" about whether to meet vulnerable relatives over Christmas. In Northern Ireland either proof of vaccination, a negative lateral flow test or a positive PCR test in the past 30-180 days is now needed to access some venues and events. And the Covid booster programme is being expanded in England and Scotland. The Scottish government has also set up ""enhanced surveillance"" in a bid to identify cases quickly and break chains of transmission. You can read more about the latest restrictionshere. This video can not be played We've heard from the prime minister this afternoon on whether Christmas parties and gatherings should be cancelled, in light of the new Omicron variant. People ""shouldn't be cancelling things, there is no need for that"", Boris Johnson says during a visit to St Thomas' Hospital to get his booster jab. ""The most important thing is people should follow the guidance we have set out,"" he says. He insists that the government is taking a ""balanced and proportionate approach to the risk"". Asked why he was refusing to discuss reports that a Downing Street gathering on 18 December 2020 broke the guidance in place at the time, the prime minister refuses to engage. One source told the BBC that ""several dozen"" people were at the event, where party games were played, and food and drink was served. Families who lost loved ones during the pandemic have said they are ""sickened"" by a No 10 Christmas party held during last year's Covid restrictions. The party took place on 18 December, when such events were banned, with a source telling the BBC ""several dozen"" people attended. Boris Johnson said on Wednesday no rules were broken but, pressed on the issue at PMQs, did not deny a party took place. Downing Street has refused to explain how the staff party was in-keeping with the rules. The Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group has called for an apology from Johnson. One of its spokespeople, Safiah Ngah, tells the BBC: ""My dad died in February from Covid-19, despite being in good health. The last Christmas period is sadly one I will never forget. ""One in 20 people in my borough had Covid-19 and my family were desperately trying to do what we could to keep each other safe. Unfortunately it wasn't enough. ""To think that just a few miles away, No 10 was throwing a 'Christmas Party', with no care for the rules they had set, is sickening."" A further 53,945 coronavirus cases have been recorded in the UK, official figures show. It is the highest daily total since 17 July, when 54,674 were recorded. There have also been a further 141 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test result. We've been hearing a lot about Christmas parties today and whether companies should host them this year. A UK minister who says it is up to individual businesses to decide whether to have a Christmas party this year says he has cancelled his own. Science minister George Freeman earlier told LBC Radio: ""I can tell you that my parliamentary team and I normally have a Christmas party. ""We've decided this year that it is probably sensible to do it by Zoom and wait for the spring. It won't be the best party in the world. ""But... we don't want to be telling every individual business what they should or shouldn't be doing. It is a matter for them."" It comes after the prime minister and health secretary said there wasno need to cancel Christmas parties. Sir Martin Sorrell, of advertising agency S4Capital, is urging the government to offer clear guidance to businesses who he says are seeing a ""sharp series of cancellations"" in Christmas parties since the emergence of the Omicron variant. Mandatory vaccinations may be needed to combat the spread of Covid cases in Germany, an ICU doctor tells the BBC. Chancellor Angela Merkel says a vaccine mandate could be imposed from February next year, if approved by parliament. Dr Hans Bodeker, a hospital consultant in Dresden, Saxony - which has the highest infection rate in the country - says a rise in hospitalisations is being driven by unvaccinated people. The surge has made him change his mind about forced vaccinations. ""If you had asked me a few weeks ago, I would have said no I don't want that. [But] at the moment I think it's the only way to get out of the situation is vaccinating, vaccinating, and probably it needs to be mandatory to heighten rates,"" he tells the BBC World Service's OS programme. Bodeker says scepticism about the government and mainstream media is making young people unsure about getting jabbed. ""People are living in their social media bubble - and they think the danger is coming not from the virus but from the vaccination. It's horrible."" Norway has announced strict new Covid measures in Oslo and nearby areas after a suspected cluster of Omicron cases was found in the capital. People have been ordered to wear masks in public places and work from home where possible. Travellers arriving in Norway must do a Covid test within 24 hours of arrival. The measures come as officials raise alarm over a possible Omicron cluster among dozens of people who attended a Christmas dinner in the capital. Up to 50 people who were at the event have since tested positive, and at least one of them has the new variant, city officials say. If the new strain is detected among all of them, it would be the one of the largest known outbreaks of the new variant in Europe. Mining company Anglo American, which employs 95,000 people worldwide, is the latest business topropose making vaccination mandatory. The Daily Telegraph reported thatinternal documents said workers who refused to get jabbed could be fired,external""as a last resort"". The company said it is consulting with staff on the policy, after encouraging workers over the last 18 months to get vaccinated and setting up facilities to give the jab at some of its sites. ""Requiring vaccination for access is the next step, given that vaccination is the best defence available,"" Anglo American said. The company has a large presence in southern Africa, where the new coronavirus variant Omicron was found to be circulating last week. It also has its headquarters in London and employs about 1,300 workers at the Woodsmith mine project in North Yorkshire. Anglo American said the policy may vary according to local laws and requirements. Vaccination rates in Africa are still dangerously low, a leading World Health Organization (WHO) official said. ""It is almost one year since the world's first Covid-19 shot was given. Yet, Africa has made little inroads in the path to providing vaccine protection,"" said Dr Salam Gueye, the WHO regional emergency director for Africa. Only 102 million people in Africa - just 7.5% of the continent's population - are fully vaccinated, he said. More than 80% have not received even a single dose, he added. ""This is a dangerously wide gap,"" he said, adding that there has been a welcome increase in vaccine supplies in the last three months. Professor Salim Abdool Karim, who is a South African epidemiologist and a member of the Africa Task Force for Coronavirus, tells the BBC there are no ""red flags"" yet with the new Omicron variant. Although transmission rates are high, the new strain appears to be similar to previous variants, Karim tells Newsday. But he cautions that as yet the evidence is only anecdotal, ""so it needs to be taken with a lot of caution"". He says doctors are seeing cases ""that are very similar to what we have seen before"". Doctors are not seeing as many cases with loss of smell or taste, but mainly more common symptoms, he says, adding severe cases could come a bit later. ""By the time people get so sick they need to be hospitalised, it's three or four weeks later. We haven't seen that picture yet,"" he says. ""But the feedback we're getting from the ground is that we are not seeing any red flags, we are not seeing anything dramatically different."" Reality Check Back to South Africa now. While there have been problems with uneven supplies of vaccines in South Africa, the fact its government has had to delay the delivery of doses suggests there is also something else going on. South Africa's Health Minister Joe Phaahla suggests ""fake news"" is playing a role in making people - especially younger age groups - unsure about the vaccine. There is a lot of fear,external- sometimes driven by misinformation or a lack of good information - about the safety of the vaccine. Serious complications are extremely rare,,externalbased on evidence from wide-scale clinical trials and the billions already jabbed, and pale in comparison to the complications from Covid, even in younger people. Some of the claims circulating are outright false, but some are based on an element of truth - that you can still get Covid after being vaccinated, for example. Research in partnership with South Africa's health department found this has led some people to believe vaccines don't work. But that's not the case - you may still catch Covid, but for most people it will be far milder because the vaccine reduces symptoms, keeps people out of hospital and massively reduces deaths from the virus. Read in full:Does southern Africa have enough vaccines? Chancellor Angela Merkel is set to hand over power to her successor Olaf Scholz next week The Covid measures just announced by Germany are an ""act of national solidarity"" in order to ""get the infection rate down and take the pressure off our health system"", Chancellor Angela Merkel says. ""The number
of infections has stabilised, but on a far too high a level,"" she adds. On Thursday, Germany recorded 73,000 new Covid cases and 388 deaths. Just under 70% of Germany's population is vaccinated against Covid - lower than several European countries, including France and the UK. Germany is also restricting the number of people who can meet inside and the country is closing nightclubs in regions with high numbers of cases. Merkel announced the new measures alongside her successor Olaf Scholz, who is set to formally take over as chancellor next week. Scholz says Germany is in a ""very, very difficult situation"" and getting unvaccinated people to get the jab is crucial to halt a new wave of infections. Jenny HillBBC Berlin correspondent Angela Merkel is preparing to
retire from office as Germany faces the worst wave of infection it's experienced
so far in the pandemic. A situation which most experts agree is due â in part â
to the millions of Germans whoâve not yet been vaccinated. Today Merkel and
her soon-to-be successor Olaf Scholz said the German Parliament would vote
on whether to make vaccination mandatory. Thereâs no date, but Merkel
suggested that â if approved â such a measure could be in place by February of
next year. She also announced further restrictions on unvaccinated people
whoâll be banned from many businesses and shops and prohibited from meeting
more than two people from another household. Angela Merkel has always resisted
mandatory vaccination, saying it was the responsibility of government to
persuade citizens. But, asked today whether she now supported the measure, she
replied: ""If I were a member of parliament, I would vote for it."" Germany has announced sweeping new restrictions for people who have not been vaccinated against Covid. Chancellor Angela Merkel says unvaccinated people will be barred from many public places, including non-essential shops and events, unless they have recently recovered from Covid. ""Culture and leisure nationwide will be open only to those who have been vaccinated or recovered,"" Merkel says. ""We have understood that the situation is very serious and
that we want to take further measures in addition to those
already taken,"" she adds. Merkel also says a nationwide
vaccination mandate could be imposed from February 2022, after it's been debated in parliament. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,1.0
"This video can not be played Watch our exclusive interview with Pfizer's CEO as he hits out at the fake news that his wife died from the vaccine People will be likely to need to have annual Covid vaccinations for many years to come, the head of Pfizer has told the BBC Dr Albert Bourla said he thought this would be needed to maintain a ""very high level of protection"". The UK has now secured an extra 114 million doses of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to be delivered over the next two years. A year ago the UK was the first country to approve the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. How worrying is the new Covid variant? Will our vaccines still work against Covid variants? Pfizers's chief executive was speaking to the BBC before the emergence of the Omicron variant, first identified in South Africa and also before the announcement that the UK government had signed contracts to buy the 54 million additional Pfizer-BioNTech and 60 million Moderna doses for 2022 and 2023. These deals include access to modified vaccines if needed to combat Omicron and future variants of concern, the Department of Health has said. Dr Bourla said Pfizer had already made updated vaccines in response to the Beta, also first identified in South Africa, and Delta, first identified in India, variants but that they had not been needed. The company is now working on an updated jab in response to the Omicron variant that could be ready in 100 days. He said vaccines had helped save millions of lives during the pandemic, and without them the ""fundamental structure of our society would be threatened"" By the end of the year Pfizer expects to have supplied three billion doses of its messenger ribonucleic-acid (mRNA) vaccine with four billion planned for next year. There had been a global race to protect people protected, Dr Bourla said, but in 2022, countries would have ""as many doses as they need"". Several global health charities see the money Pfizer, BioNTech and Moderna are making out of the pandemic as immoral. Pfizer will generate at least $35bn of Covid vaccine sales this year and has seen its share price soar. But while most people in the world have now had at least one Covid jab,in parts of Africa it is less than one person in 20. Many people in Africa remained unvaccinated Dr Bourla was unapologetic about making a profit, saying ""the bottom line is millions of lives were saved."" He continued; ""We have saved the global economy trillions of dollars. ""It is a strong incentive for innovation for the next pandemic. ""But people will see that if they step up to the game, to bring something that saves lives and saves money, there is also a financial reward."" He denied profiteering - saying the jab was the ""cost of a takeaway meal"" for richer countries but sold at no profit to low-income ones - but accepted rich countries such as the UK had placed orders early and availability had initially been limited. Having to be stored at -70C, the Pfizer vaccine has been tricky to deploy in countries with limited health services. But within a month or so, Pfizer says it will roll out a new formulation of the vaccine that can be stored for three months in a fridge, which Dr Bourla said, would make a ""huge difference"" for sub-Saharan African countries. Pfizer has also developed an antiviral pill, Paxlovid, which in trialscut hospital admissions and deaths by nearly 90%. It should be approved in the US shortly and the UK government has agreed to buy enough for 250,000 patients. Pfizer is also conducting Covid-vaccine trials in the under-fives. And in October, the United States Food and Drug Administration approved the Pfizer jab for five to 11-year-olds. Immunising that age group in the UK and Europe would be a very good idea, Dr Bourla said. ""Covid in schools is thriving,"" he said. ""This is disturbing, significantly, the educational system, and there are kids that will have severe symptoms. ""So there is no doubt in my mind that the benefits, completely, are in favour of doing it."" The mRNA vaccines, from Pfizer and Moderna have now taken over almost completely from the UK developed Oxford-AstraZeneca jab. And Dr Bourla had a strong message for those who did not want to have vaccines. ""For those that are just afraid, the only emotion of human beings stronger than fear is love,"" he said. ""So I am using always this argument that the decision to get another vaccine is not going to influence only your health, it is going to affect the health of others and particularly the health of the people you love the most, because they are the ones that you will interact with. ""So take the courage to overcome your fears and do the right thing."" He has recently been the target of some bizarre fake news stories, alleging the US Federal Bureau of Investigation had arrested him for fraud and his wife had died as a result of side-effects from the Pfizer vaccine - both untrue. ""In the first news, that I was arrested by the FBI, of course I laughed,"" he said. ""On the second news, that my wife died, with a picture of her, I was really [angry]. ""I worried about my kids, so I tried to call them and I could not get my son on the phone. ""What we had to go through, it is nothing compared to the lives that will be lost because of the rubbish that those people published, because people will really think that my wife died because of the vaccine... and she is fine - she is wonderful.""

"A number of big businesses are holding smaller Christmas parties within departments, rather than larger, company-wide events. Uncertainty over the Omicron Covid variant has added to safety concerns over large gatherings. Several companies, including NatWest, Aviva and Deloitte are hosting smaller team-based parties, and said attendance at any event will be a personal choice. Events businesses said they hoped for big parties to help them recoup losses. Consultancy firms PwC, EY and KPMG also confirmed that firm-wide events were not planned, but smaller teams could make plans among themselves. ""We won't be holding a large firm-wide Christmas party for our people in the UK this year, but teams will be able to have smaller celebrations,"" EY said. How are Covid rules and booster jabs changing? What are England's mask rules now? Meanwhile, KPMG said in light of the new Covid variant, team gatherings could ""still take place but we are stressing that this is only if our people feel comfortable doing"". About 52% of UK workplaces have decided not to hold a Christmas office party, according to a survey of 2,000 office workers commissioned by Covid testing company Prenetics. The government has said there isno need to cancel Christmas partiesdespite the emergence of the Omicron coronavirus variant, with people urged to get a booster vaccine. However, NHS Providers said some NHS trusts have asked staff ""not to mix in big groups"" in the run-up to Christmas. Plextek Services Ltd, an engineering services business based in Great Chesterford, told the BBC it had postponed its office Christmas party from 10 December to 25 February. Chief executive Brent Hudson said some of its 80-strong workforce were ""becoming worried"" about the new variant, so the postponement made sense because Plextek wanted to have ""as well-attended an event as possible"". ""The venue said that if we postponed any closer to 10 December than now, we would be liable for the full cost,"" he added. ""We felt there is a reasonable chance the government will ban such gatherings between now and 10 December and are unwilling to write off the cost."" Sir Martin Sorrell, executive chairman of the advertising agency S4 Capital, said that among its clients there has been ""a sharp series of cancellations since this [Omicron] happened just three, four, five days ago"". ""The uncertainty is extreme,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. ""And government policy - understandably, to be a little bit sympathetic to the government, it is an extremely difficult situation - but we have been through this before with Delta and the previous variants so you would have thought the government would be a little bit more prepared for what may or may not happen in terms of scenarios and planning."" NatWest, which employs nearly 60,000 full-time staff, has urged employees to take a lateral flow test before attending team events. Insurance firm Aviva has also asked staff to take a Covid test on the morning of their Christmas parties, which are understood to be taking place within teams. The company also advised people to ""wear face coverings as appropriate"". Covid: Is an office Christmas party too risky? 'Weâve had 20 cancellations in one weekend' No need to cancel Christmas party plans - Javid Rosie McInerney, people and talent lead at broadband provider Cuckoo, said there was ""so much value in all getting together as a business,"" adding: ""There's only so much that Zoom and Google Meet can do for you."" Alisa Mistry, HR advice manager at CharlieHR, said the 3,000 businesses the company it works with were not looking to cancel their Christmas parties, but were asking for ""guidance on how they can keep everyone safe"". Matthew Dibley is taking his staff on holiday to Lanzarote to thank them for their hard work Matthew Dibley, owner and manager of Bang and Olufsen in Exeter, is taking his six staff on a four-day Christmas holiday to Lanzarote. Mr Dibley told the BBC he decided on the trip, from 16 December to 19 December, to reward his staff for their hard work over a ""rough couple of years"". ""We like to treat our staff well and pay them well,"" he said. ""It's not something we would normally do."" However, Mr Dibley said he and his team are worried whether concerns over the new Omicron variant will lead to more international travel restrictions. ""We just think this will be typical if we are not allowed to go,"" he added. ""We are hoping we can still go."" Business Minister George Freeman said: ""For many small businesses who have four or five staff who work together every day anyway gathering to have a drink is not a big risk, but some companies might normally bring hundreds of people in from around the world and they, this year, may decide is that sensible, given the pandemic and where we are. ""In the end I think businesses know how to make those decisions."" The emergence of the new Covid strain has not led to restrictions being placed on hospitality, but businesses say customer confidence in eating and drinking out has taken a hit, with a flurry of cancellations ahead of the sector's main money-making period of the year. Michael Kill, chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association, told the BBC he would have ""absolutely loved"" to have seen the return of the Christmas party this year, but bookings had ""stalled"" since the emergence of the Omicron variant. He said a number of event companies had also reported cancellations in recent days. ""The government needs to recognise that, while restrictions are not in place for the hospitality and night time economy sectors, we are reliving the moments of March 2020 where the prime minister asked people not to go to pubs, bars, clubs and theatres,"" Mr Kill added. Design My Night, a digital platform which allows people to make bookings at restaurants, bars and pubs, said it had seen a spike in people cancelling bookings scheduled during December. The company said that after the government announced masks would be mandatory in shops in England again last week, cancellations increased 14%, compared to the week before. Hospitality has been one of the hardest hit industries by the coronavirus pandemic, with pubs, hotels and eateries having to close during three lockdowns. ""The chilling talk of Plan B is already being felt across hospitality as bookings are cancelled and plans changed,"" said Kate Nicholls, chief executive of industry body UK Hospitality. ""There is no doubt that this will have a damaging effect on businesses, just as they head into their key trading period.""

"(Clockwise from top left) Elton John, Nadiya Hussain, Iain Duncan Smith, Jill Scott, Ainsley Harriot, Gabby Logan The government has been fined Â£500,000 for mistakenly sharing the postal addresses of more than 1,000 New Year Honours recipients online. Singer Sir Elton John, sports presenter Gabby Logan and TV cook Nadiya Hussain were among those affected. The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) found that the Cabinet Office had failed to put adequate measures in place to avoid such data breaches. The error, which occurred in 2019, resulted from ""complacency"", it added. The government apologised for the data breach and said it had put measures in place to avoid a repeat of it. Government apologises for honours list data breach On 27 December 2019 the Cabinet Office, the government department which handles honours. published a file on the gov.uk website showing the unredacted addresses of 1,097 people receiving New Year honours for 2020. After officials became aware of the data breach, the weblink to the file was removed, but it was still cached and available online to people typing in the exact web address. The data was online for two hours and 21 minutes and was accessed 3,872 times. Cricketer Ben Stokes, chef Ainsley Harriott and former Ofcom boss Sharon White were also among those affected. The ICO received three complaints from people whose details were shared. Its director of investigations, Steve Eckersley, said: ""At a time when [the recipients] should have been celebrating and enjoying the announcement of their honour, they were faced with the distress of their personal details being exposed. ""The Cabinet Office's complacency and failure to mitigate the risk of a data breach meant that hundreds of people were potentially exposed to the risk of identity fraud and threats to their personal safety. ""The fine issued today sends a message to other organisations that looking after people's information safely, as well as regularly checking that appropriate measures are in place, must be at the top of their agenda."" The Cabinet Office said it wanted to ""reiterate"" a previous apology it made over the incident. A spokesperson added: ""We took action to mitigate any potential harm by immediately informing the information commissioner and everyone affected by the breach. ""We take the findings of the information commissioner very seriously, and have completed an internal review, as well as implemented a number of measures to ensure this does not happen again. ""This includes a review of the overall security of the system, information management training and improving internal processes for how data is handled by the honours team.""

"Ballyclare Secondary School has ""a number of issues"", its board of governors confirmed The Education Authority (EA) has investigated ""staffing related matters"" and financial issues at a County Antrim post-primary school. The board of governors at Ballyclare Secondary School confirmed there were ""a number of issues"" at the school. A survey of staff health and wellbeing carried out by four teaching unions also highlighted a number of concerns. The investigation into finances found school funds were ""used inappropriately in relation to some activities"". The EA said its investigation ""found no evidence of fraudulent activity,"" but concerns about the school have also been raised with the Northern Ireland Audit Office (NIAO). The local Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) assembly member Steve Aiken has also written to Education Minister Michelle McIlveen warning of a ""worrying catalogue of issues"" in the school. In statement, the Department of Education (DE) said there were ""a range of significant and complex issues"" there which ""may take time to resolve"". Some teachers who responded to a union survey said there was a ""culture of fear"" at the school Ballyclare Secondary School has more than 1,000 pupils. However, following a number of concerns, four teaching unions - the NEU, NASUWT, INTO and UTU - carried out a joint survey into the health and wellbeing of their members in the school. That sort of joint action by teaching unions is highly unusual, BBC News NI understands. A total of 69 out of 77 eligible teaching union members of staff responded to the extensive survey which was carried out in May and June 2021 - a response rate of about 90%. Two-thirds (46) of those who responded said they did not ""feel valued as a member of staff"" while a similar number (47) disagreed that ""the health, safety and welfare of staff"" was viewed as a priority within the school. Some teachers also described a ""culture of fear"" in the school in the survey. The National Education Union (NEU) said the joint survey ""pointed to clear and unmistakeable problems of leadership and governance"" at Ballyclare Secondary School. ""The level of intervention in the school by the Education Authority is unparalleled in Northern Ireland's schools system,"" the union said. In a statement the EA said that ""due to ongoing HR and legal processes the EA is very restricted in what we can say about any ongoing staffing issues"". However the authority said it was ""working closely with the board of governors, leadership team and staff at Ballyclare Secondary School to provide ongoing support, advice and guidance in relation to a range of matters, which include HR, school improvement, and governance and audit"". The EA said it was providing ""ongoing support and advice"" to the school in a number of ways. One of the authority's senior school improvement officers is in Ballyclare Secondary School providing ""support to the principal and senior leadership team in taking forward school improvement priorities,"" according to the EA. An EA officer is also providing support for the board of governors on ""school governance matters"" while the authority has also held what it described as ""workshops"" with staff to address ""some key issues"". It has been warned that schools are facing a ""perfect storm"" Meanwhile, the EA's internal audit and assurance department also carried out an investigation into concerns raised by a whistle-blower into financial matters at the school. That investigation was into both the use of money contributed through voluntary contributions by parents - ""private school funds"" - and the budget provided directly to the school by the DE and EA. ""The investigation into the use of private school funds reported in November 2020 and concluded that there were a number of occasions when the Ballyclare Secondary School's private fund account and also local management of schools budget was used inappropriately in relation to some activities,"" the EA told BBC News NI. ""Whilst this expenditure was not in line with best practice guidance, the investigation found no evidence of fraudulent activity. ""We are working closely with the school to ensure all key actions are fully addressed and implemented. ""We have also briefed the Northern Ireland Audit Office in relation to the concerns raised, investigations carried out, steps taken, and will co-operate fully in any further actions as required."" Children design site to tackle cyberbullying Parents 'should prepare' for disruption in schools Some pupils remote learning amid staff shortage In a statement to BBC News NI, the NIAO said concerns regarding Ballyclare Secondary School had been raised with it. ""An NIAO investigation is not under way, but we are engaging with both the Department of Education and the Education Authority on these matters, and continue to monitor the situation,"" the NIAO said. But the EA did not specify exactly how money was ""used inappropriately"". BBC News NI also contacted Ballyclare Secondary School's board of governors regarding the concerns raised about the school. In a statement they said: ""We fully recognise and accept that there are a number of issues that we are working through. ""This doesn't and shouldn't in anyway detract from the hard work and dedication of all of our staff and senior leadership team who strive to give our young people the best educational experience and start in life. ""We are on an improvement journey and are absolutely committed to addressing all of the issues identified and continuing to ensure that our school grows and develops and delivers for all young people. ""A part of this we will be listening to our staff, their representatives and the wider school community as we work to make improvements. ""We will also continue to work with EA and other partners to fully support our staff, their health and wellbeing and professional development."" Mr Aiken wrote to the education minister on 14 October to highlight ""significant areas of concern"" in Ballyclare Secondary School. ""I think it is fair to say that the level of correspondence I have received about the school far exceeds that of any other establishment in my constituency,"" he wrote. ""That there are systemic issues at the school needing resolution, is now beyond any doubt."" UUP assembly member Steve Aiken has called for action Mr Aiken suggested a meeting between local assembly members, the EA, DE and the chairman of the school governors ""to resolve these issues"". The EA also said it had briefed DE and the minister ""on the range of concerns raised in relation to Ballyclare Secondary School and the actions being taken to resolve the issues"". In a statement to BBC News NI a spokesperson for DE said the minister was ""aware of the issues regarding Ballyclare Secondary School and is keen to see these resolved as soon as possible"". ""The minister has met with the Education Authority to discuss the efforts being made to address the issues,"" they added. ""It is understood there are a range of significant and complex issues and these may take time to resolve. ""The minister will continue to monitor progress through updates from the EA.""

"""Jane"" cried when describing how difficult she found it to tell her story Defence lawyers for British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell have been trying to find inconsistencies in the testimony of a key accuser at her trial. The accuser, known as ""Jane"", says she was abused by Ms Maxwell and convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein aged 14. But on Wednesday, defence counsel Laura Menninger presented documents suggesting Jane was uncertain about Ms Maxwell's participation in the abuse. Ms Maxwell denies sex-trafficking charges. She has pleaded not guilty to eight charges of sex trafficking and other crimes, covering a period from 1994-2004. She has been in a US jail since her arrest last year, and faces up to 80 years in prison if convicted. The defence claims she is being used as a scapegoat for Epstein's crimes, following his death in prison in 2019. Prosecutors argue the pair were ""partners in crime"" in sex abuse. They say Ms Maxwell, who also has American and French citizenship, recruited and groomed underage girls for her long-term companion Epstein to abuse. Epstein died in a New York prison cell on 10 August 2019 as he awaited trial on sex-trafficking charges in a federal case. His death was ruled to be a suicide. Ghislaine Maxwell 'won't get fair trial' - brother Who is Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's ex-girlfriend? Panorama: The Prince and the Epstein Scandal Who was Jeffrey Epstein? Jane is the first of four alleged victims to testify at the trial. Cross-examining the witness, defence lawyer Laura Menninger produced documents from law enforcement dating back to December 2019 suggesting that Jane was unclear about whether Ms Maxwell was present during the abuse, or whether she touched or kissed her. In her court appearance on Tuesday, Jane had described the alleged abuse - which went on from 1994 to 1997 -  in graphic detail, saying that Ms Maxwell was present for much of it and was ""very casual"" about the encounters. Under cross-examination she denied changing her story and questioned the accuracy of the documents, adding that the statements she made then were never recorded. Through tears she said she had found it difficult to tell the officers involved in initial questioning ""the most shameful, deepest secrets that I've been carrying around with me my whole life"". Jane also denied using her experience as a soap opera actor to embellish her testimony, and said she had no financial interest in testifying. She said that while she had received $5m (Â£3.75m) from the victims' compensation fund she wished she had never received that money. ""I guess in this country compensation is the only thing you can get to try and move on with your life,"" Jane added. Her only motivation for testifying, she said, was to ""find some sort of closure"". Four charges relate to the years 1994-97 when Ms Maxwell was, according to an indictment, among Epstein's closest associates and also in an ""intimate relationship"" with him. Two other charges - of sex trafficking conspiracy and sex trafficking of a minor - came in an amended indictment and relate to the period 2001 and 2004. 6 July 2019 Financier Jeffrey Epstein is arrested in New Jersey after returning from France on a private jet. Federal charges accuse Epstein of trafficking a “vast network” of underage girls for sex. He kills himself in a New York jail 36 days after his arrest. 3 July 2020 British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell is arrested in New Hampshire and accused of helping Epstein groom his victims. Charges accuse her of befriending girls as young as 14 and enticing them into having sexual relations with Epstein. One alleged victim told the BBC that she “controlled the girls - she was like Madam”. Prosecutors claim the abuse occurred in locations around the world, including Ms Maxwellâs London home. She pleads not guilty. A judge denies her bail, calling her a flight risk. 29 March 2021 Two new US federal charges of sex trafficking conspiracy and sex trafficking of a minor are filed against Ms Maxwell, adding to the six she already faced. Prosecutors say a fourth victim has been identified. The victim was allegedly abused in 2001 when she was 14 years old. Ms Maxwell denies these charges. 23 April 2021 Ms Maxwell appears in court for the first time, pleading not guilty to multiple charges of sex abuse, sex-trafficking and perjury. Her defence lawyers argue that the conditions in her Brooklyn jail are inhumane and argue that she is “being treated horribly”. She is denied bail. 29 November 2021 Ms Maxwell trial begins in New York, where she has been in jail since her arrest. Earlier in November, a jury candidate pool of over 600 New Yorkers was whittled down to 12 jury members. Born outside Paris on Christmas Day, 1961, Ms Maxwell grew up in a country mansion, went to Oxford University and speaks several languages. She is the youngest child of late media mogul Robert Maxwell. She is said to have had a very close relationship with her late father, and he named his luxury yacht - the Lady Ghislaine - after her. Ghislaine Maxwell was said to be very close to her late father Robert Maxwell Soon after her father's death in 1991, Ms Maxwell left the UK to settle in America, where she worked in real estate, and not long after met Jeffrey Epstein. She sold her Manhattan townhouse in 2016, and kept a low profile until she was arrested last July at her secluded mansion in the state of New Hampshire.

"Germany will ban unvaccinated people from shops and bars, unless they have recently recovered from Covid Chancellor Angela Merkel says a nationwide vaccination mandate could be imposed in Germany from February 2022 The UK government signs deals to buy 114 million more doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to use in 2022 and 2023 The deals were speeded up after the Omicron variant emerged - but talks were already under way But the WHO points out that many poorer countries have still not been able to vaccinate their most vulnerable UK regulators approve new treatment that could reduce hospitalisation and death by 79% in high-risk adults Health officials say Omicron has now become dominant in South Africa and is driving a sharp increase in new infections We're pausing our live coverage of the pandemic now but we'll be back tomorrow morning. Here's a reminder of the day's main developments:  Today's live page posts were written by Jen Meierhans, Joseph Lee, Hamish Mackay, George Wright and Jack Hunter. The live page was edited by Emma Harrison and Emma Owen. Thanks for joining us.  Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter With the rise of the Omicron variant, Joe Biden is back in front of the American people later with another set of steps to stop the spread of Covid-19. Unlike hislast major action, however, the administrationâs plan is light on government mandates â perhaps a reflection of the political firestorm his previous orders created and the legal morass that has enveloped them. Instead, Biden is pushing for greater access to testing and encouraging, but not requiring, all Americans to get vaccination booster shots. He also makes specific mention of keeping schools open and children in classrooms â a reflection of the white-hot rage last yearâs extended closures generated among some suburban parents, who have become a key part of the Democratsâ electoral voting bloc. When Biden assumed the presidency earlier this year, he acknowledged the success of his tenure would be determined in large part by his ability to contain the pandemic and return a semblance of normalcy to American life. After some early positive results, the rise of new variants â along with vaccine hesitancy among some in the US â dampened those hopes and exacted an economic and political toll. Todayâs actions suggest Biden knows a return to normal is still a long way off. As we've been reporting, Germany has announced sweeping new restrictions for unvaccinated people to curb coronavirus infections. Chancellor Angela Merkel has described the measures as an ""act of national solidarity"" in response to a ""very serious"" situation in Germany. Some German states already operate so-called 2G policies - which stands for forgenesen(recovered in the past six months) orgeimpft(vaccinated). Here's what Merkel announced:  Read more about Germany's new rules here. Pilots are urging the UK government to provide specific financial support for the aviation sector due to the impact of the Omicron variant of coronavirus. Fully-vaccinated UK arrivals must self-isolate until they receive a negative result from a PCR test. And the red list has also been resurrected, with 10 southern African countries added. EasyJet said on Tuesday that it has seen demand softening due to the emergence of the new strain of Covid-19. Pilots' union Balpa is calling for the government to provide a Winter Resilience Fund to ensure cash-strapped airlines and other aviation companies survive the coming months. Balpa general secretary Martin Chalk says: ""Holiday and New Year traffic is a core part of the winter season for airlines. ""With this being severely depressed by shattered confidence and restrictions, we need winter support measures to help us weather the storm of Omicron uncertainty."" The advertising regulator has cleared Tesco's Christmas TV campaign featuring Father Christmas bearing a Covid vaccine passport after it prompted 5,000 complaints from viewers. The ad, titled This Christmas, Nothing's Stopping Us, shows the supermarket's customers determined to enjoy a proper Christmas with family and friends after last year's Covid-related restrictions. However, in one scene a reporter appears on TV with ""breaking news"", telling viewers that ""Santa could be quarantined"".
Father Christmas is then shown presenting his Covid pass at border control, proving he has been vaccinated to a customs officer so he can enter the country without restriction. Commenting on complaints that the ad is coercive and encourages medical discrimination, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) says the advert ""doesn't break our rules and there are no grounds for further action"". ""In summary, we consider that the depiction of Santa displaying a proof of vaccine status in an airport is likely to be seen as a humorous reference to international travel rules people have experienced this year; it is unlikely to be interpreted as a message about these rules or the Covid-19 vaccine more widely. ""While we understand that some people disagree with the vaccine programme and may find the ad in poor taste, we have concluded that the ad is unlikely to be seen as irresponsible or cause serious or widespread offence on the basis suggested."" As the debate over Christmas parties rumbles on (No 10 says, for now, they should take place), Transport for London (TfL) is already looking ahead to New Year's Eve. Whether Londoners will be out socialising amid the spread of Omicron remains unclear, but one thing that is certain is that free Tube travel on New Year's Eve has been scrapped for the second year in a row. This is due to the ""catastrophic impact of the pandemic"" on finances, TfL says. Normally London's Underground is free from 23:45 GMT until 04:30 GMT. Services will still run through the night but usual fares will apply. It is the second year of no free travel, but last year's celebrations were restricted due to the pandemic. This year a ticketedcelebration at Trafalgar Square replacesthe annual fireworks display on the Thames. Read the full story. Covid measures have been strengthened in response to concern over the newly identified Omicron variant. Let's have a look at what the rules are in the UK. The rules in England changed this week, meaning that face coverings are once again compulsory in shops and on public transport. Anyone entering the UK also now requires a PCR test within 48 hours of arrival and must self-isolate until they have a negative result. The 10 day self-isolation rule has also been brought in again for all contacts of suspected Omicron cases. Face coverings are already mandatory in shops, health and social care settings and on public transport in Wales. But First Minister Mark Drakeford has urged people to ""think carefully"" about whether to meet vulnerable relatives over Christmas. In Northern Ireland either proof of vaccination, a negative lateral flow test or a positive PCR test in the past 30-180 days is now needed to access some venues and events. And the Covid booster programme is being expanded in England and Scotland. The Scottish government has also set up ""enhanced surveillance"" in a bid to identify cases quickly and break chains of transmission. You can read more about the latest restrictionshere. This video can not be played We've heard from the prime minister this afternoon on whether Christmas parties and gatherings should be cancelled, in light of the new Omicron variant. People ""shouldn't be cancelling things, there is no need for that"", Boris Johnson says during a visit to St Thomas' Hospital to get his booster jab. ""The most important thing is people should follow the guidance we have set out,"" he says. He insists that the government is taking a ""balanced and proportionate approach to the risk"". Asked why he was refusing to discuss reports that a Downing Street gathering on 18 December 2020 broke the guidance in place at the time, the prime minister refuses to engage. One source told the BBC that ""several dozen"" people were at the event, where party games were played, and food and drink was served. Families who lost loved ones during the pandemic have said they are ""sickened"" by a No 10 Christmas party held during last year's Covid restrictions. The party took place on 18 December, when such events were banned, with a source telling the BBC ""several dozen"" people attended. Boris Johnson said on Wednesday no rules were broken but, pressed on the issue at PMQs, did not deny a party took place. Downing Street has refused to explain how the staff party was in-keeping with the rules. The Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group has called for an apology from Johnson. One of its spokespeople, Safiah Ngah, tells the BBC: ""My dad died in February from Covid-19, despite being in good health. The last Christmas period is sadly one I will never forget. ""One in 20 people in my borough had Covid-19 and my family were desperately trying to do what we could to keep each other safe. Unfortunately it wasn't enough. ""To think that just a few miles away, No 10 was throwing a 'Christmas Party', with no care for the rules they had set, is sickening."" A further 53,945 coronavirus cases have been recorded in the UK, official figures show. It is the highest daily total since 17 July, when 54,674 were recorded. There have also been a further 141 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test result. We've been hearing a lot about Christmas parties today and whether companies should host them this year. A UK minister who says it is up to individual businesses to decide whether to have a Christmas party this year says he has cancelled his own. Science minister George Freeman earlier told LBC Radio: ""I can tell you that my parliamentary team and I normally have a Christmas party. ""We've decided this year that it is probably sensible to do it by Zoom and wait for the spring. It won't be the best party in the world. ""But... we don't want to be telling every individual business what they should or shouldn't be doing. It is a matter for them."" It comes after the prime minister and health secretary said there wasno need to cancel Christmas parties. Sir Martin Sorrell, of advertising agency S4Capital, is urging the government to offer clear guidance to businesses who he says are seeing a ""sharp series of cancellations"" in Christmas parties since the emergence of the Omicron variant. Mandatory vaccinations may be needed to combat the spread of Covid cases in Germany, an ICU doctor tells the BBC. Chancellor Angela Merkel says a vaccine mandate could be imposed from February next year, if approved by parliament. Dr Hans Bodeker, a hospital consultant in Dresden, Saxony - which has the highest infection rate in the country - says a rise in hospitalisations is being driven by unvaccinated people. The surge has made him change his mind about forced vaccinations. ""If you had asked me a few weeks ago, I would have said no I don't want that. [But] at the moment I think it's the only way to get out of the situation is vaccinating, vaccinating, and probably it needs to be mandatory to heighten rates,"" he tells the BBC World Service's OS programme. Bodeker says scepticism about the government and mainstream media is making young people unsure about getting jabbed. ""People are living in their social media bubble - and they think the danger is coming not from the virus but from the vaccination. It's horrible."" Norway has announced strict new Covid measures in Oslo and nearby areas after a suspected cluster of Omicron cases was found in the capital. People have been ordered to wear masks in public places and work from home where possible. Travellers arriving in Norway must do a Covid test within 24 hours of arrival. The measures come as officials raise alarm over a possible Omicron cluster among dozens of people who attended a Christmas dinner in the capital. Up to 50 people who were at the event have since tested positive, and at least one of them has the new variant, city officials say. If the new strain is detected among all of them, it would be the one of the largest known outbreaks of the new variant in Europe. Mining company Anglo American, which employs 95,000 people worldwide, is the latest business topropose making vaccination mandatory. The Daily Telegraph reported thatinternal documents said workers who refused to get jabbed could be fired,external""as a last resort"". The company said it is consulting with staff on the policy, after encouraging workers over the last 18 months to get vaccinated and setting up facilities to give the jab at some of its sites. ""Requiring vaccination for access is the next step, given that vaccination is the best defence available,"" Anglo American said. The company has a large presence in southern Africa, where the new coronavirus variant Omicron was found to be circulating last week. It also has its headquarters in London and employs about 1,300 workers at the Woodsmith mine project in North Yorkshire. Anglo American said the policy may vary according to local laws and requirements. Vaccination rates in Africa are still dangerously low, a leading World Health Organization (WHO) official said. ""It is almost one year since the world's first Covid-19 shot was given. Yet, Africa has made little inroads in the path to providing vaccine protection,"" said Dr Salam Gueye, the WHO regional emergency director for Africa. Only 102 million people in Africa - just 7.5% of the continent's population - are fully vaccinated, he said. More than 80% have not received even a single dose, he added. ""This is a dangerously wide gap,"" he said, adding that there has been a welcome increase in vaccine supplies in the last three months. Professor Salim Abdool Karim, who is a South African epidemiologist and a member of the Africa Task Force for Coronavirus, tells the BBC there are no ""red flags"" yet with the new Omicron variant. Although transmission rates are high, the new strain appears to be similar to previous variants, Karim tells Newsday. But he cautions that as yet the evidence is only anecdotal, ""so it needs to be taken with a lot of caution"". He says doctors are seeing cases ""that are very similar to what we have seen before"". Doctors are not seeing as many cases with loss of smell or taste, but mainly more common symptoms, he says, adding severe cases could come a bit later. ""By the time people get so sick they need to be hospitalised, it's three or four weeks later. We haven't seen that picture yet,"" he says. ""But the feedback we're getting from the ground is that we are not seeing any red flags, we are not seeing anything dramatically different."" Reality Check Back to South Africa now. While there have been problems with uneven supplies of vaccines in South Africa, the fact its government has had to delay the delivery of doses suggests there is also something else going on. South Africa's Health Minister Joe Phaahla suggests ""fake news"" is playing a role in making people - especially younger age groups - unsure about the vaccine. There is a lot of fear,external- sometimes driven by misinformation or a lack of good information - about the safety of the vaccine. Serious complications are extremely rare,,externalbased on evidence from wide-scale clinical trials and the billions already jabbed, and pale in comparison to the complications from Covid, even in younger people. Some of the claims circulating are outright false, but some are based on an element of truth - that you can still get Covid after being vaccinated, for example. Research in partnership with South Africa's health department found this has led some people to believe vaccines don't work. But that's not the case - you may still catch Covid, but for most people it will be far milder because the vaccine reduces symptoms, keeps people out of hospital and massively reduces deaths from the virus. Read in full:Does southern Africa have enough vaccines? Chancellor Angela Merkel is set to hand over power to her successor Olaf Scholz next week The Covid measures just announced by Germany are an ""act of national solidarity"" in order to ""get the infection rate down and take the pressure off our health system"", Chancellor Angela Merkel says. ""The number
of infections has stabilised, but on a far too high a level,"" she adds. On Thursday, Germany recorded 73,000 new Covid cases and 388 deaths. Just under 70% of Germany's population is vaccinated against Covid - lower than several European countries, including France and the UK. Germany is also restricting the number of people who can meet inside and the country is closing nightclubs in regions with high numbers of cases. Merkel announced the new measures alongside her successor Olaf Scholz, who is set to formally take over as chancellor next week. Scholz says Germany is in a ""very, very difficult situation"" and getting unvaccinated people to get the jab is crucial to halt a new wave of infections. Jenny HillBBC Berlin correspondent Angela Merkel is preparing to
retire from office as Germany faces the worst wave of infection it's experienced
so far in the pandemic. A situation which most experts agree is due â in part â
to the millions of Germans whoâve not yet been vaccinated. Today Merkel and
her soon-to-be successor Olaf Scholz said the German Parliament would vote
on whether to make vaccination mandatory. Thereâs no date, but Merkel
suggested that â if approved â such a measure could be in place by February of
next year. She also announced further restrictions on unvaccinated people
whoâll be banned from many businesses and shops and prohibited from meeting
more than two people from another household. Angela Merkel has always resisted
mandatory vaccination, saying it was the responsibility of government to
persuade citizens. But, asked today whether she now supported the measure, she
replied: ""If I were a member of parliament, I would vote for it."" Germany has announced sweeping new restrictions for people who have not been vaccinated against Covid. Chancellor Angela Merkel says unvaccinated people will be barred from many public places, including non-essential shops and events, unless they have recently recovered from Covid. ""Culture and leisure nationwide will be open only to those who have been vaccinated or recovered,"" Merkel says. ""We have understood that the situation is very serious and
that we want to take further measures in addition to those
already taken,"" she adds. Merkel also says a nationwide
vaccination mandate could be imposed from February 2022, after it's been debated in parliament. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,1.1562614e-10
"The Duchess of Sussex has apologised to a court for making a misleading statement in her privacy case against the Mail on Sunday's publishers. The Appeal Court heard she had asked an aide to pass on information to the authors of a biography - despite having earlier said she ""did not contribute"". Meghan said she had forgotten the events and had not intended to mislead. Associated Newspapers is trying to overturn a ruling after it published a letter from the duchess to her father. Meghan, 40, won her privacy case against the publisher of the Mail on Sunday earlier this year, when the High Courtfound its publication of the letter was unlawful. Associated Newspapers' legal team are now seeking to overturn this judgement at the Court of Appeal, disputing that this was simply a private and personal letter - and have argued that it was crafted with the ""possibility of public consumption"" in mind. Meghan weighed up calling father 'daddy' Privacy damage 'runs deep', says Meghan Newspaper must publish statement on Meghan case A spokesman for the Sussexes had previously said the couple""did not contribute"" to the Finding Freedom biography, written by Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand. But in new evidence heard on Wednesday, Jason Knauf, the couple's former communications secretary, said the book was ""discussed on a routine basis"" and ""discussed directly with the duchess multiple times in person and over email"". He also discussed planning a meeting with the authors to provide background information and said Meghan had given him briefing points to share with them, including information on how she had ""very minimal contact"" with her half-siblings during her childhood. Two of the arguments put forward by Meghan's lawyers in her battle with the Mail on Sunday would appear to have been compromised by these latest revelations. She has always claimed that she did not co-operate with the authors of the book Finding Freedom, but she has now remembered that she provided ""briefing notes"" to one of her key aides who she knew was in touch with the book's authors. The second strand of her case that would appear to have been undermined is her assertion that she had an ""expectation of privacy"" when she sent her handwritten letter to her estranged father Thomas Markle, which was partially published by the Mail on Sunday. It has now emerged in previously unpublished texts that she accepted the possibility the letter might be leaked. She had used language, she said in one text to her head of communications, that ""would pull at the heartstrings"". It will now be for the Court of Appeal to decide whether to stand by or overturn the original finding that was in favour of the duchess. Inthe second day of the appeal hearing,lawyers for Associated Newspapers had also challenged the extent to which the letter from Meghan to her father - at the centre of the case it is trying to overturn - was ""private"". They quoted an exchange of text messages between the duchess and Mr Knauf in which Meghan said: ""Obviously everything I have drafted is with the understanding that it could be leaked, so I have been meticulous in my word choice."" Mr Knauf's evidence to the court also included emails with the Duke of Sussex, discussing the proposed meeting with the authors and the need to conceal any involvement by Prince Harry and Meghan. The former aide said Prince Harry replied: ""I totally agree that we have to be able to say we didn't have anything to do with it. ""Equally, you giving the right context and background to them would help get some truths out there."" In a witness statement to the court the duchess said she accepted that her aide did provide information to the authors of the book with her knowledge but she said the ""extent of the information he shared is unknown to me"". ""When I approved the passage... I did not have the benefit of seeing these emails and I apologise to the court for the fact that I had not remembered these exchanges at the time,"" she said. ""I had absolutely no wish or intention to mislead the defendant or the court."" The court heard Prince Harry - pictured with Meghan at an event in New York on Wednesday - had said the couple needed to be able to deny any involvement in briefing the authors The duchess added that she would have been ""more than happy"" to refer to the exchanges with Mr Knauf if she had been aware of them at the time, but said they were ""a far cry from the very detailed personal information that the defendant alleges that I wanted or permitted to put into the public domain"". Another reason the duchess gave for not discovering the emails between her and Mr Knauf sooner was that the disclosure stage of the litigation had not yet been reached, and in October last year her lawyers applied to adjourn the trial date as she was pregnant. She said she was advised to avoid stress after a recent miscarriage, which came shortly after Associated Newspapers Limited indicated it wished to reveal the identities of her five friends who gave an interview to the US magazine People, in which they referred to her relationship with her father. Meghan said: ""I was in the first trimester of my third pregnancy at the time, having suffered a miscarriage a few months prior, and was feeling very unwell. ""My doctor advised me to avoid stress, particularly given the recent miscarriage days after the defendant threatened to break the confidentiality of the original 'sources' for the People magazine article, which resulted in my having to make an urgent application for an anonymity order. ""This was granted... but I found the process extremely stressful, and it took its toll physically and emotionally. ""I have at all times wanted to protect the privacy of those friends, while the defendant was, it seemed to me, doing everything it could to make this litigation as intrusive as possible.""

"Dealing with the legacy of the Troubles has proved divisive but all Stormont parties oppose a statute of limitations Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis has suggested that the government will not introduce legislation on legacy imminently. He was speaking in London after a meeting of the British Irish Intergovernmental Conference (BIIC). On Tuesday,Sinn FÃ©in and the DUP criticised Number 10's intention to press ahead with plans to end Troubles-related prosecutions. However Mr Lewis refused to be drawn on specific timing. ""If it takes more time, we're prepared to do that,"" he said. He suggested that he wanted to find agreement on an approach to ""help Northern Ireland move forward"". ""This is ultimately about delivering for the people,"" he added. He said it appeared the legislation would not make into the final autumn statement this week, and said the government would do everything it could to reach consensus. All the main Stormont parties havecriticised the plans. Mr Lewis refused to be drawn on specific timing and said ""if it takes more time, we're prepared to do that"" It would bring in a statute of limitations to cover crimes committed during the Troubles up to April 1998 and would apply to military veterans as well as ex-paramilitaries. Also speaking at the BIIC, Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney reiterated that there was ""not support"" for the UK government's plans. Mr Coveney said discussions would continue with the Stormont parties. Political reaction to PM's Troubles prosecutions plan Legacy proposals 'may give amnesty to killers' In June, thefirst British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference in more than two yearstook place at Dublin Castle. After that meeting, the UK and Irish governments agreed ""a process of intensive engagement"" on legacy matters. The BIIC is a body set up to promote cooperation between the UK and Ireland and brings together representatives from both sides of the Irish Sea. Troubles amnesty 'set for imminent introduction' Plan to end all NI Troubles prosecutions confirmed On Thursday, at London's Foreign Office, Mr Lewis was also asked about negotiations over the Northern Ireland Protocol. He said there remained ""substantive gaps"" between the UK and EU but repeated that Number 10 did not want to trigger Article 16 to suspend parts of the arrangements. Simon Coveney and Brandon Lewis last attended a British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference in June Relations between London and Dublin have deteriorated because of the fallout from Brexit. Unionists have also objected to the protocol, which put a trade border in the Irish Sea and kept Northern Ireland aligned with some EU rules. The Irish government believes that an agreement on animal and plant standards would get rid of up to 80% of all checks but the UK is reluctant to align to EU rules. Discussions to reach a breakthrough between the UK and EU have been taking place for some six weeks, with more talks expected later this week.

"This video can not be played Watch our exclusive interview with Pfizer's CEO as he hits out at the fake news that his wife died from the vaccine People will be likely to need to have annual Covid vaccinations for many years to come, the head of Pfizer has told the BBC Dr Albert Bourla said he thought this would be needed to maintain a ""very high level of protection"". The UK has now secured an extra 114 million doses of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to be delivered over the next two years. A year ago the UK was the first country to approve the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. How worrying is the new Covid variant? Will our vaccines still work against Covid variants? Pfizers's chief executive was speaking to the BBC before the emergence of the Omicron variant, first identified in South Africa and also before the announcement that the UK government had signed contracts to buy the 54 million additional Pfizer-BioNTech and 60 million Moderna doses for 2022 and 2023. These deals include access to modified vaccines if needed to combat Omicron and future variants of concern, the Department of Health has said. Dr Bourla said Pfizer had already made updated vaccines in response to the Beta, also first identified in South Africa, and Delta, first identified in India, variants but that they had not been needed. The company is now working on an updated jab in response to the Omicron variant that could be ready in 100 days. He said vaccines had helped save millions of lives during the pandemic, and without them the ""fundamental structure of our society would be threatened"" By the end of the year Pfizer expects to have supplied three billion doses of its messenger ribonucleic-acid (mRNA) vaccine with four billion planned for next year. There had been a global race to protect people protected, Dr Bourla said, but in 2022, countries would have ""as many doses as they need"". Several global health charities see the money Pfizer, BioNTech and Moderna are making out of the pandemic as immoral. Pfizer will generate at least $35bn of Covid vaccine sales this year and has seen its share price soar. But while most people in the world have now had at least one Covid jab,in parts of Africa it is less than one person in 20. Many people in Africa remained unvaccinated Dr Bourla was unapologetic about making a profit, saying ""the bottom line is millions of lives were saved."" He continued; ""We have saved the global economy trillions of dollars. ""It is a strong incentive for innovation for the next pandemic. ""But people will see that if they step up to the game, to bring something that saves lives and saves money, there is also a financial reward."" He denied profiteering - saying the jab was the ""cost of a takeaway meal"" for richer countries but sold at no profit to low-income ones - but accepted rich countries such as the UK had placed orders early and availability had initially been limited. Having to be stored at -70C, the Pfizer vaccine has been tricky to deploy in countries with limited health services. But within a month or so, Pfizer says it will roll out a new formulation of the vaccine that can be stored for three months in a fridge, which Dr Bourla said, would make a ""huge difference"" for sub-Saharan African countries. Pfizer has also developed an antiviral pill, Paxlovid, which in trialscut hospital admissions and deaths by nearly 90%. It should be approved in the US shortly and the UK government has agreed to buy enough for 250,000 patients. Pfizer is also conducting Covid-vaccine trials in the under-fives. And in October, the United States Food and Drug Administration approved the Pfizer jab for five to 11-year-olds. Immunising that age group in the UK and Europe would be a very good idea, Dr Bourla said. ""Covid in schools is thriving,"" he said. ""This is disturbing, significantly, the educational system, and there are kids that will have severe symptoms. ""So there is no doubt in my mind that the benefits, completely, are in favour of doing it."" The mRNA vaccines, from Pfizer and Moderna have now taken over almost completely from the UK developed Oxford-AstraZeneca jab. And Dr Bourla had a strong message for those who did not want to have vaccines. ""For those that are just afraid, the only emotion of human beings stronger than fear is love,"" he said. ""So I am using always this argument that the decision to get another vaccine is not going to influence only your health, it is going to affect the health of others and particularly the health of the people you love the most, because they are the ones that you will interact with. ""So take the courage to overcome your fears and do the right thing."" He has recently been the target of some bizarre fake news stories, alleging the US Federal Bureau of Investigation had arrested him for fraud and his wife had died as a result of side-effects from the Pfizer vaccine - both untrue. ""In the first news, that I was arrested by the FBI, of course I laughed,"" he said. ""On the second news, that my wife died, with a picture of her, I was really [angry]. ""I worried about my kids, so I tried to call them and I could not get my son on the phone. ""What we had to go through, it is nothing compared to the lives that will be lost because of the rubbish that those people published, because people will really think that my wife died because of the vaccine... and she is fine - she is wonderful."" Update 20 February 2023: Following publication of this article, the opinions expressed by Dr Bourla were the subject of a lengthy complaint to the Prescription Medicines Code of Practice Authority. Ina ruling published in Dec 2022,external, some aspects of the complaint were upheld by the PMCPA Appeal Board. CASES:How many cases are there in your area? VACCINE:When will I get the jab?

"Thousands of people are still without power in Scotland and northern England, six days after Storm Arwen hit the UK. About 16,000 homes did not have electricity, Boris Johnson said, with the majority expected to have supply restored by the end of the week. Amajor incident has been declared in County Durham, meaning extra support can be provided to the thousands of people still without power. Three people died as the storm brought high winds and cold weather on Friday. Among them was 35-year-oldDavid Lapage, who died after his truck was struck by a falling treein Aberdeenshire. More than 50 rare trees toppled in Storm Arwen Stranded Tally the turtle begins its recovery Downing Street has said it is in ""hourly contact"" with network operators and is working urgently to ensure welfare and shelter is provided to those who need it. The prime minister said about120 military personnel were being drafted in to help the recovery effortin the Grampian region of Scotland. Mr Johnson said:  ""It was a very, very big storm. We are doing everything we can to to help people."" He said that while there had been about 19,000 homes without power on Thursday morning about 3,000 had now had electricity restored. ""That is no consolation for the 16,000 who are still suffering but we are working flat out to help you,"" he added. Welfare centres have been set up and in some cases energy suppliers have found emergency accommodation and provided generators and food vans to support communities without power. Butsome residents have criticised utility companiesfor ""woeful"" communication and have said they feel forgotten. Some properties - particularly in remote areas - may not get electricity before Saturday, energy suppliers have warned. Sara Stanley said she was unable to leave her home for a hotel as she was self-isolating with Covid Durham County Council said the decision to declare a major incident had been made as Northern Powergrid was ""not yet in a position to confirm when supplies will be reinstated to all properties"". It means additional support from the council and emergency services will be made available to people hit by a loss of power. Laura and David Venner have been temporarily housed in a Newcastle hotel with their four children - three of whom are disabled - since Sunday, after losing power at their home. ""It was absolutely freezing,"" Mrs Venner said. ""I broke down at 6am and said 'we've got to leave.'"" Cold temperatures could make their children ""seriously ill"", she said, adding that while they were grateful being in a hotel was ""far from ideal"" as they were unable to bring medical equipment their children needed. Their power was restored on Thursday and Mrs Venner said it felt like a ""massive Christmas present that's just come early"" to be able to get back to normality. ""Electricity, warmth and lighting everybody takes for granted every day. We've been without, I really won't take it for granted any more,"" she said. Sara Stanley, from Medburn in Northumberland, told BBC News she had been without power until Tuesday when, after pressure from residents, a generator was provided for her estate. She said it had been ""a bit grim"" as she had tested positive for Covid and thought she would have ended up in hospital if not for the generator. She said the initial advice had been to go to a hotel or stay with relatives - but she was not able to as she was required to self-isolate. Linda Dunk said she expected more power cuts over the winter due to damage to infrastructure Linda Dunk had the power restored to her Aberdeenshire home on Thursday afternoon after six days without heating, light or water. She told BBC News they were going to get a generator as she thought the infrastructure had been so badly damaged there may be more problems later this winter. ""I don't want to spend another six days like this, I'm too old,"" she said. ""I want to go to bed not worrying about these sorts of things."" Tony and Nicola Hills from Kirkby Lonsdale, Cumbria, have had to move out as they and their five children were ""struggling to keep warm, washed and properly fed"". In a letter to his MP Mr Hills described Electricity North West's call centres and IT systems as ""woefully inadequate"", adding that he had received a text saying they had been reconnected when they had not. Many power lines have been damaged by falling trees The ongoing efforts to restore power come as cold weather, including rain and sleet, is expected across the UK. The Met Office saidmore snow is expected to hit Scotland,externalon Friday, while rain is predicted for the north western parts.

"The Duchess of Sussex has apologised to a court for making a misleading statement in her privacy case against the Mail on Sunday's publishers. The Appeal Court heard she had asked an aide to pass on information to the authors of a biography - despite having earlier said she ""did not contribute"". Meghan said she had forgotten the events and had not intended to mislead. Associated Newspapers is trying to overturn a ruling after it published a letter from the duchess to her father. Meghan, 40, won her privacy case against the publisher of the Mail on Sunday earlier this year, when the High Courtfound its publication of the letter was unlawful. Associated Newspapers' legal team are now seeking to overturn this judgement at the Court of Appeal, disputing that this was simply a private and personal letter - and have argued that it was crafted with the ""possibility of public consumption"" in mind. Meghan weighed up calling father 'daddy' Privacy damage 'runs deep', says Meghan Newspaper must publish statement on Meghan case A spokesman for the Sussexes had previously said the couple""did not contribute"" to the Finding Freedom biography, written by Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand. But in new evidence heard on Wednesday, Jason Knauf, the couple's former communications secretary, said the book was ""discussed on a routine basis"" and ""discussed directly with the duchess multiple times in person and over email"". He also discussed planning a meeting with the authors to provide background information and said Meghan had given him briefing points to share with them, including information on how she had ""very minimal contact"" with her half-siblings during her childhood. Two of the arguments put forward by Meghan's lawyers in her battle with the Mail on Sunday would appear to have been compromised by these latest revelations. She has always claimed that she did not co-operate with the authors of the book Finding Freedom, but she has now remembered that she provided ""briefing notes"" to one of her key aides who she knew was in touch with the book's authors. The second strand of her case that would appear to have been undermined is her assertion that she had an ""expectation of privacy"" when she sent her handwritten letter to her estranged father Thomas Markle, which was partially published by the Mail on Sunday. It has now emerged in previously unpublished texts that she accepted the possibility the letter might be leaked. She had used language, she said in one text to her head of communications, that ""would pull at the heartstrings"". It will now be for the Court of Appeal to decide whether to stand by or overturn the original finding that was in favour of the duchess. Inthe second day of the appeal hearing,lawyers for Associated Newspapers had also challenged the extent to which the letter from Meghan to her father - at the centre of the case it is trying to overturn - was ""private"". They quoted an exchange of text messages between the duchess and Mr Knauf in which Meghan said: ""Obviously everything I have drafted is with the understanding that it could be leaked, so I have been meticulous in my word choice."" Mr Knauf's evidence to the court also included emails with the Duke of Sussex, discussing the proposed meeting with the authors and the need to conceal any involvement by Prince Harry and Meghan. The former aide said Prince Harry replied: ""I totally agree that we have to be able to say we didn't have anything to do with it. ""Equally, you giving the right context and background to them would help get some truths out there."" In a witness statement to the court the duchess said she accepted that her aide did provide information to the authors of the book with her knowledge but she said the ""extent of the information he shared is unknown to me"". ""When I approved the passage... I did not have the benefit of seeing these emails and I apologise to the court for the fact that I had not remembered these exchanges at the time,"" she said. ""I had absolutely no wish or intention to mislead the defendant or the court."" The court heard Prince Harry - pictured with Meghan at an event in New York on Wednesday - had said the couple needed to be able to deny any involvement in briefing the authors The duchess added that she would have been ""more than happy"" to refer to the exchanges with Mr Knauf if she had been aware of them at the time, but said they were ""a far cry from the very detailed personal information that the defendant alleges that I wanted or permitted to put into the public domain"". Another reason the duchess gave for not discovering the emails between her and Mr Knauf sooner was that the disclosure stage of the litigation had not yet been reached, and in October last year her lawyers applied to adjourn the trial date as she was pregnant. She said she was advised to avoid stress after a recent miscarriage, which came shortly after Associated Newspapers Limited indicated it wished to reveal the identities of her five friends who gave an interview to the US magazine People, in which they referred to her relationship with her father. Meghan said: ""I was in the first trimester of my third pregnancy at the time, having suffered a miscarriage a few months prior, and was feeling very unwell. ""My doctor advised me to avoid stress, particularly given the recent miscarriage days after the defendant threatened to break the confidentiality of the original 'sources' for the People magazine article, which resulted in my having to make an urgent application for an anonymity order. ""This was granted... but I found the process extremely stressful, and it took its toll physically and emotionally. ""I have at all times wanted to protect the privacy of those friends, while the defendant was, it seemed to me, doing everything it could to make this litigation as intrusive as possible.""

"This video can not be played Watch our exclusive interview with Pfizer's CEO as he hits out at the fake news that his wife died from the vaccine People will be likely to need to have annual Covid vaccinations for many years to come, the head of Pfizer has told the BBC Dr Albert Bourla said he thought this would be needed to maintain a ""very high level of protection"". The UK has now secured an extra 114 million doses of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to be delivered over the next two years. A year ago the UK was the first country to approve the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. How worrying is the new Covid variant? Will our vaccines still work against Covid variants? Pfizers's chief executive was speaking to the BBC before the emergence of the Omicron variant, first identified in South Africa and also before the announcement that the UK government had signed contracts to buy the 54 million additional Pfizer-BioNTech and 60 million Moderna doses for 2022 and 2023. These deals include access to modified vaccines if needed to combat Omicron and future variants of concern, the Department of Health has said. Dr Bourla said Pfizer had already made updated vaccines in response to the Beta, also first identified in South Africa, and Delta, first identified in India, variants but that they had not been needed. The company is now working on an updated jab in response to the Omicron variant that could be ready in 100 days. He said vaccines had helped save millions of lives during the pandemic, and without them the ""fundamental structure of our society would be threatened"" By the end of the year Pfizer expects to have supplied three billion doses of its messenger ribonucleic-acid (mRNA) vaccine with four billion planned for next year. There had been a global race to protect people protected, Dr Bourla said, but in 2022, countries would have ""as many doses as they need"". Several global health charities see the money Pfizer, BioNTech and Moderna are making out of the pandemic as immoral. Pfizer will generate at least $35bn of Covid vaccine sales this year and has seen its share price soar. But while most people in the world have now had at least one Covid jab,in parts of Africa it is less than one person in 20. Many people in Africa remained unvaccinated Dr Bourla was unapologetic about making a profit, saying ""the bottom line is millions of lives were saved."" He continued; ""We have saved the global economy trillions of dollars. ""It is a strong incentive for innovation for the next pandemic. ""But people will see that if they step up to the game, to bring something that saves lives and saves money, there is also a financial reward."" He denied profiteering - saying the jab was the ""cost of a takeaway meal"" for richer countries but sold at no profit to low-income ones - but accepted rich countries such as the UK had placed orders early and availability had initially been limited. Having to be stored at -70C, the Pfizer vaccine has been tricky to deploy in countries with limited health services. But within a month or so, Pfizer says it will roll out a new formulation of the vaccine that can be stored for three months in a fridge, which Dr Bourla said, would make a ""huge difference"" for sub-Saharan African countries. Pfizer has also developed an antiviral pill, Paxlovid, which in trialscut hospital admissions and deaths by nearly 90%. It should be approved in the US shortly and the UK government has agreed to buy enough for 250,000 patients. Pfizer is also conducting Covid-vaccine trials in the under-fives. And in October, the United States Food and Drug Administration approved the Pfizer jab for five to 11-year-olds. Immunising that age group in the UK and Europe would be a very good idea, Dr Bourla said. ""Covid in schools is thriving,"" he said. ""This is disturbing, significantly, the educational system, and there are kids that will have severe symptoms. ""So there is no doubt in my mind that the benefits, completely, are in favour of doing it."" The mRNA vaccines, from Pfizer and Moderna have now taken over almost completely from the UK developed Oxford-AstraZeneca jab. And Dr Bourla had a strong message for those who did not want to have vaccines. ""For those that are just afraid, the only emotion of human beings stronger than fear is love,"" he said. ""So I am using always this argument that the decision to get another vaccine is not going to influence only your health, it is going to affect the health of others and particularly the health of the people you love the most, because they are the ones that you will interact with. ""So take the courage to overcome your fears and do the right thing."" He has recently been the target of some bizarre fake news stories, alleging the US Federal Bureau of Investigation had arrested him for fraud and his wife had died as a result of side-effects from the Pfizer vaccine - both untrue. ""In the first news, that I was arrested by the FBI, of course I laughed,"" he said. ""On the second news, that my wife died, with a picture of her, I was really [angry]. ""I worried about my kids, so I tried to call them and I could not get my son on the phone. ""What we had to go through, it is nothing compared to the lives that will be lost because of the rubbish that those people published, because people will really think that my wife died because of the vaccine... and she is fine - she is wonderful."" Update 20 February 2023: Following publication of this article, the opinions expressed by Dr Bourla were the subject of a lengthy complaint to the Prescription Medicines Code of Practice Authority.

"(Clockwise from top left) Elton John, Nadiya Hussain, Iain Duncan Smith, Jill Scott, Ainsley Harriot, Gabby Logan The government has been fined Â£500,000 for mistakenly sharing the postal addresses of more than 1,000 New Year Honours recipients online. Singer Sir Elton John, sports presenter Gabby Logan and TV cook Nadiya Hussain were among those affected. The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) found that the Cabinet Office had failed to put adequate measures in place to avoid such data breaches. The error, which occurred in 2019, resulted from ""complacency"", it added. The government apologised for the data breach and said it had put measures in place to avoid a repeat of it. Government apologises for honours list data breach On 27 December 2019 the Cabinet Office, the government department which handles honours. published a file on the gov.uk website showing the unredacted addresses of 1,097 people receiving New Year honours for 2020. After officials became aware of the data breach, the weblink to the file was removed, but it was still cached and available online to people typing in the exact web address. The data was online for two hours and 21 minutes and was accessed 3,872 times. Cricketer Ben Stokes, chef Ainsley Harriott and former Ofcom boss Sharon White were also among those affected. The ICO received three complaints from people whose details were shared. Its director of investigations, Steve Eckersley, said: ""At a time when [the recipients] should have been celebrating and enjoying the announcement of their honour, they were faced with the distress of their personal details being exposed. ""The Cabinet Office's complacency and failure to mitigate the risk of a data breach meant that hundreds of people were potentially exposed to the risk of identity fraud and threats to their personal safety. ""The fine issued today sends a message to other organisations that looking after people's information safely, as well as regularly checking that appropriate measures are in place, must be at the top of their agenda."" The Cabinet Office said it wanted to ""reiterate"" a previous apology it made over the incident. A spokesperson added: ""We took action to mitigate any potential harm by immediately informing the information commissioner and everyone affected by the breach. ""We take the findings of the information commissioner very seriously, and have completed an internal review, as well as implemented a number of measures to ensure this does not happen again. ""This includes a review of the overall security of the system, information management training and improving internal processes for how data is handled by the honours team.""

"""Jane"" cried when describing how difficult she found it to tell her story Defence lawyers for British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell have been trying to find inconsistencies in the testimony of a key accuser at her trial. The accuser, known as ""Jane"", says she was abused by Ms Maxwell and convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein aged 14. But on Wednesday, defence counsel Laura Menninger presented documents suggesting Jane was uncertain about Ms Maxwell's participation in the abuse. Ms Maxwell denies sex-trafficking charges. She has pleaded not guilty to eight charges of sex trafficking and other crimes, covering a period from 1994-2004. She has been in a US jail since her arrest last year, and faces up to 80 years in prison if convicted. The defence claims she is being used as a scapegoat for Epstein's crimes, following his death in prison in 2019. Prosecutors argue the pair were ""partners in crime"" in sex abuse. They say Ms Maxwell, who also has American and French citizenship, recruited and groomed underage girls for her long-term companion Epstein to abuse. Epstein died in a New York prison cell on 10 August 2019 as he awaited trial on sex-trafficking charges in a federal case. His death was ruled to be a suicide. Ghislaine Maxwell 'won't get fair trial' - brother Who is Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's ex-girlfriend? Panorama: The Prince and the Epstein Scandal Who was Jeffrey Epstein? Jane is the first of four alleged victims to testify at the trial. Cross-examining the witness, defence lawyer Laura Menninger produced documents from law enforcement dating back to December 2019 suggesting that Jane was unclear about whether Ms Maxwell was present during the abuse, or whether she touched or kissed her. In her court appearance on Tuesday, Jane had described the alleged abuse - which went on from 1994 to 1997 -  in graphic detail, saying that Ms Maxwell was present for much of it and was ""very casual"" about the encounters. Under cross-examination she denied changing her story and questioned the accuracy of the documents, adding that the statements she made then were never recorded. Through tears she said she had found it difficult to tell the officers involved in initial questioning ""the most shameful, deepest secrets that I've been carrying around with me my whole life"". Jane also denied using her experience as a soap opera actor to embellish her testimony, and said she had no financial interest in testifying. She said that while she had received $5m (Â£3.75m) from the victims' compensation fund she wished she had never received that money. ""I guess in this country compensation is the only thing you can get to try and move on with your life,"" Jane added. Her only motivation for testifying, she said, was to ""find some sort of closure"". Four charges relate to the years 1994-97 when Ms Maxwell was, according to an indictment, among Epstein's closest associates and also in an ""intimate relationship"" with him. Two other charges - of sex trafficking conspiracy and sex trafficking of a minor - came in an amended indictment and relate to the period 2001 and 2004. 6 July 2019 Financier Jeffrey Epstein is arrested in New Jersey after returning from France on a private jet. Federal charges accuse Epstein of trafficking a “vast network” of underage girls for sex. He kills himself in a New York jail 36 days after his arrest. 3 July 2020 British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell is arrested in New Hampshire and accused of helping Epstein groom his victims. Charges accuse her of befriending girls as young as 14 and enticing them into having sexual relations with Epstein. One alleged victim told the BBC that she “controlled the girls - she was like Madam”. Prosecutors claim the abuse occurred in locations around the world, including Ms Maxwellâs London home. She pleads not guilty. A judge denies her bail, calling her a flight risk. 29 March 2021 Two new US federal charges of sex trafficking conspiracy and sex trafficking of a minor are filed against Ms Maxwell, adding to the six she already faced. Prosecutors say a fourth victim has been identified. The victim was allegedly abused in 2001 when she was 14 years old. Ms Maxwell denies these charges. 23 April 2021 Ms Maxwell appears in court for the first time, pleading not guilty to multiple charges of sex abuse, sex-trafficking and perjury. Her defence lawyers argue that the conditions in her Brooklyn jail are inhumane and argue that she is “being treated horribly”. She is denied bail. 29 November 2021 Ms Maxwell trial begins in New York, where she has been in jail since her arrest. Earlier in November, a jury candidate pool of over 600 New Yorkers was whittled down to 12 jury members. Born outside Paris on Christmas Day, 1961, Ms Maxwell grew up in a country mansion, went to Oxford University and speaks several languages. She is the youngest child of late media mogul Robert Maxwell. She is said to have had a very close relationship with her late father, and he named his luxury yacht - the Lady Ghislaine - after her. Ghislaine Maxwell was said to be very close to her late father Robert Maxwell Soon after her father's death in 1991, Ms Maxwell left the UK to settle in America, where she worked in real estate, and not long after met Jeffrey Epstein. She sold her Manhattan townhouse in 2016, and kept a low profile until she was arrested last July at her secluded mansion in the state of New Hampshire.

"Sandy Birtles says she is worried about rising prices When she goes in to check on him at night, Sandy Birtles says she can hardly see her teenage son for all the layers on his bed. The single mother of two says that the family do all they can to keep warm as the bills continue to rise. ""I do not have the heating on when the kids are at school,"" she said. ""If I'm not running around and clearing up, then I'm wrapping up in a coat."" She said that financial pressures mean she had been ""penny-pinching all the time"", but she said rising energy bills have added to the strain. They have to be careful not to use too much hot water, she said, and when her 15-year-old son wanted to add to his bedding she got him a double duvet. How to save energy at home and help the planet What can I do if my energy supplier goes bust? She is worried that these bills will continue to rise, and a charity has predicted that she - and millions of others - will face a particularly difficult bill shock early next year. National Energy Action has predicted that when domestic energy prices rise in April, it will mean that the typical domestic gas bill will have doubled in 18 months. The charity, which campaigns for warm, dry homes, used industry data and forecasts to predict that the typical gas bill, for those on standard tariffs, is likely to have gone up from Â£466 a year in October 2020, to Â£944 in April 2022. Catherine Geddes uses blankets to stay warm Catherine Geddes, who lives on her own in Keighley, is also struggling to cover her energy costs and was worried about the likelihood of them continuing to rise sharply. She has found unusual ways to try to keep the cost down. ""I very rarely put the heating on. Basically I wrap myself up in a blanket and I will use the hairdryer to warm me up. ""My anxiety levels are so high. It is just a nightmare."" National Energy Action information on help with energy bills,external Most households pay for their gas and electricity together in a dual-fuel deal. Those who pay a standard tariff are protected by the industry regulator Ofgem's price cap. This was set at its lowest level in October 2020, owing to relatively low wholesale prices faced by suppliers. It meant the typical annual domestic energy bill for millions of households was no higher than Â£1,042 a year. However, it has increased twice since then, most recently its biggest increase to date this October, which meant those on standard tariffs, with typical household levels of energy use, saw an increase of Â£139 to Â£1,277 a year. There is widespread expectation that owing to soaring wholesale gas prices in recent months the next price cap in April will be set at a much higher level than now. National Energy Action has predicted that this is likely to be a Â£550 a year increase for a typical standard tariff dual fuel customer. ""The cost of living in the UK is at its highest level in a decade with household energy bills the biggest driver. When the costs of essential services go up, those on lowest incomes get hit hardest,"" said Adam Scorer, the charity's chief executive. ""For people already on a budgetary knife-edge, the cost of keeping a family warm has exploded while budgets have collapsed. No amount of useful tips or savvy shopping can cope with that."" The existence of the price cap has delayed the impact of surging wholesale prices on household bills. However, it has also been blamed as creating an unmanageable market by some of the smaller energy firms which have collapsed during the current crisis. Their customers have been moved onto tariffs with other suppliers, in line with the price cap. As a result, hundreds of thousands of people who might have expected to be protected from price rises as they were on a fixed rate will now also be hit by the April price rise. In October, Ofgem chief executive Jonathan Brearley told the BBC that the price cap was there to stop firms making unfair profits, but ""legitimate costs have to be passed through"". He said it was too early to say how much the rise in April would be or whether Ofgem would have to review the price cap more frequently in future. Energy UK, which represents the industry, has said that anyone who is struggling to pay for their energy bill should call their supplier for support. ""Suppliers have put forward more support for customers who might be struggling with their bills this year, and we are currently working with consumer groups to help raise awareness of the help that is available,"" said Emma Pinchbeck, Energy UK's chief executive.

"A number of big businesses are holding smaller Christmas parties within departments, rather than larger, company-wide events. Uncertainty over the Omicron Covid variant has added to safety concerns over large gatherings. Several companies, including NatWest, Aviva and Deloitte are hosting smaller team-based parties, and said attendance at any event will be a personal choice. Events businesses said they hoped for big parties to help them recoup losses. Consultancy firms PwC, EY and KPMG also confirmed that firm-wide events were not planned, but smaller teams could make plans among themselves. ""We won't be holding a large firm-wide Christmas party for our people in the UK this year, but teams will be able to have smaller celebrations,"" EY said. How are Covid rules and booster jabs changing? What are England's mask rules now? Meanwhile, KPMG said in light of the new Covid variant, team gatherings could ""still take place but we are stressing that this is only if our people feel comfortable doing"". About 52% of UK workplaces have decided not to hold a Christmas office party, according to a survey of 2,000 office workers commissioned by Covid testing company Prenetics. The government has said there isno need to cancel Christmas partiesdespite the emergence of the Omicron coronavirus variant, with people urged to get a booster vaccine. However, NHS Providers said some NHS trusts have asked staff ""not to mix in big groups"" in the run-up to Christmas. Plextek Services Ltd, an engineering services business based in Great Chesterford, told the BBC it had postponed its office Christmas party from 10 December to 25 February. Chief executive Brent Hudson said some of its 80-strong workforce were ""becoming worried"" about the new variant, so the postponement made sense because Plextek wanted to have ""as well-attended an event as possible"". ""The venue said that if we postponed any closer to 10 December than now, we would be liable for the full cost,"" he added. ""We felt there is a reasonable chance the government will ban such gatherings between now and 10 December and are unwilling to write off the cost."" Sir Martin Sorrell, executive chairman of the advertising agency S4 Capital, said that among its clients there has been ""a sharp series of cancellations since this [Omicron] happened just three, four, five days ago"". ""The uncertainty is extreme,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. ""And government policy - understandably, to be a little bit sympathetic to the government, it is an extremely difficult situation - but we have been through this before with Delta and the previous variants so you would have thought the government would be a little bit more prepared for what may or may not happen in terms of scenarios and planning."" NatWest, which employs nearly 60,000 full-time staff, has urged employees to take a lateral flow test before attending team events. Insurance firm Aviva has also asked staff to take a Covid test on the morning of their Christmas parties, which are understood to be taking place within teams. The company also advised people to ""wear face coverings as appropriate"". Covid: Is an office Christmas party too risky? 'Weâve had 20 cancellations in one weekend' No need to cancel Christmas party plans - Javid Rosie McInerney, people and talent lead at broadband provider Cuckoo, said there was ""so much value in all getting together as a business,"" adding: ""There's only so much that Zoom and Google Meet can do for you."" Alisa Mistry, HR advice manager at CharlieHR, said the 3,000 businesses the company it works with were not looking to cancel their Christmas parties, but were asking for ""guidance on how they can keep everyone safe"". Matthew Dibley is taking his staff on holiday to Lanzarote to thank them for their hard work Matthew Dibley, owner and manager of Bang and Olufsen in Exeter, is taking his six staff on a four-day Christmas holiday to Lanzarote. Mr Dibley told the BBC he decided on the trip, from 16 December to 19 December, to reward his staff for their hard work over a ""rough couple of years"". ""We like to treat our staff well and pay them well,"" he said. ""It's not something we would normally do."" However, Mr Dibley said he and his team are worried whether concerns over the new Omicron variant will lead to more international travel restrictions. ""We just think this will be typical if we are not allowed to go,"" he added. ""We are hoping we can still go."" Business Minister George Freeman said: ""For many small businesses who have four or five staff who work together every day anyway gathering to have a drink is not a big risk, but some companies might normally bring hundreds of people in from around the world and they, this year, may decide is that sensible, given the pandemic and where we are. ""In the end I think businesses know how to make those decisions."" The emergence of the new Covid strain has not led to restrictions being placed on hospitality, but businesses say customer confidence in eating and drinking out has taken a hit, with a flurry of cancellations ahead of the sector's main money-making period of the year. Michael Kill, chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association, told the BBC he would have ""absolutely loved"" to have seen the return of the Christmas party this year, but bookings had ""stalled"" since the emergence of the Omicron variant. He said a number of event companies had also reported cancellations in recent days. ""The government needs to recognise that, while restrictions are not in place for the hospitality and night time economy sectors, we are reliving the moments of March 2020 where the prime minister asked people not to go to pubs, bars, clubs and theatres,"" Mr Kill added. Design My Night, a digital platform which allows people to make bookings at restaurants, bars and pubs, said it had seen a spike in people cancelling bookings scheduled during December. The company said that after the government announced masks would be mandatory in shops in England again last week, cancellations increased 14%, compared to the week before. Hospitality has been one of the hardest hit industries by the coronavirus pandemic, with pubs, hotels and eateries having to close during three lockdowns. ""The chilling talk of Plan B is already being felt across hospitality as bookings are cancelled and plans changed,"" said Kate Nicholls, chief executive of industry body UK Hospitality. ""There is no doubt that this will have a damaging effect on businesses, just as they head into their key trading period.""

"Boris Johnson pictured at a Christmas market at Downing Street earlier this week A week is a long time in politics. If that old saying is correct, a year represents decades, centuries even. Butclaims on Wednesday about what happened in Downing Street 12 months agodo seem relevant today, and may not just be consigned to the past. The Mirror newspaper splashed claims,externalthat there'd been 'boozy parties' in No 10 this time last year on more than one occasion. The suggestions weren't made on the record, but were solid enough for not one, but two opposition leaders to take them on. And despite what his team had told journalists early on Wednesday morning, Boris Johnson himself, when put under pressure on the issue in the Commons, didn't deny the gatherings had taken place, saying only that the Covid rules at the time had been followed. Later, a source who had attended the alleged gatherings on 18 December in No 10 told us there'd been ""several dozen"" people in attendance, with food, drink and even party games on offer, with the event, however it was described, going on past midnight. At the time, reasonable interactions were acceptable under the rules in the work place. But socialising was clearly off limits. It's even said that on the night the mood was subdued because staff were discussing the possible impact of what was then known as the new ""Kent variant"". It was only the next day, the 19 December, that Boris Johnson tightened Covid rules still further, ""cancelling Christmas"". This video can not be played Watch: Keir Starmer asks if No 10 held a Christmas party while the rest of the country was in lockdown The revelations, continued in Thursday's papers, can't just be shrugged off, for two reasons. First, what happened gives yet more ammunition to the opposition parties to make one of their most charged claims - that the prime minister and his team (even though he was not said to be at this gathering) set the rules for the country, but don't pay much attention to convention themselves. And second, the doubts about No 10's commitment have emerged during a period of awkward limbo. Downing Street and the rest of us are waiting to find out more about the winter 2021 new variant, hoping fervently that there is no need for a drastic step backwards, a reintroduction of strict limits on our lives, to protect against the spread of the  virus. Reminders of the dramatic reversal of government policy 12 months ago don't do much to assuage that fear.

"Germany will ban unvaccinated people from shops and bars, unless they have recently recovered from Covid Chancellor Angela Merkel says a nationwide vaccination mandate could be imposed in Germany from February 2022 The UK government signs deals to buy 114 million more doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to use in 2022 and 2023 The deals were speeded up after the Omicron variant emerged - but talks were already under way But the WHO points out that many poorer countries have still not been able to vaccinate their most vulnerable UK regulators approve new treatment that could reduce hospitalisation and death by 79% in high-risk adults Health officials say Omicron has now become dominant in South Africa and is driving a sharp increase in new infections We're pausing our live coverage of the pandemic now but we'll be back tomorrow morning. Here's a reminder of the day's main developments:  Today's live page posts were written by Jen Meierhans, Joseph Lee, Hamish Mackay, George Wright and Jack Hunter. The live page was edited by Emma Harrison and Emma Owen. Thanks for joining us.  Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter With the rise of the Omicron variant, Joe Biden is back in front of the American people later with another set of steps to stop the spread of Covid-19. Unlike hislast major action, however, the administrationâs plan is light on government mandates â perhaps a reflection of the political firestorm his previous orders created and the legal morass that has enveloped them. Instead, Biden is pushing for greater access to testing and encouraging, but not requiring, all Americans to get vaccination booster shots. He also makes specific mention of keeping schools open and children in classrooms â a reflection of the white-hot rage last yearâs extended closures generated among some suburban parents, who have become a key part of the Democratsâ electoral voting bloc. When Biden assumed the presidency earlier this year, he acknowledged the success of his tenure would be determined in large part by his ability to contain the pandemic and return a semblance of normalcy to American life. After some early positive results, the rise of new variants â along with vaccine hesitancy among some in the US â dampened those hopes and exacted an economic and political toll. Todayâs actions suggest Biden knows a return to normal is still a long way off. As we've been reporting, Germany has announced sweeping new restrictions for unvaccinated people to curb coronavirus infections. Chancellor Angela Merkel has described the measures as an ""act of national solidarity"" in response to a ""very serious"" situation in Germany. Some German states already operate so-called 2G policies - which stands for forgenesen(recovered in the past six months) orgeimpft(vaccinated). Here's what Merkel announced:  Read more about Germany's new rules here. Pilots are urging the UK government to provide specific financial support for the aviation sector due to the impact of the Omicron variant of coronavirus. Fully-vaccinated UK arrivals must self-isolate until they receive a negative result from a PCR test. And the red list has also been resurrected, with 10 southern African countries added. EasyJet said on Tuesday that it has seen demand softening due to the emergence of the new strain of Covid-19. Pilots' union Balpa is calling for the government to provide a Winter Resilience Fund to ensure cash-strapped airlines and other aviation companies survive the coming months. Balpa general secretary Martin Chalk says: ""Holiday and New Year traffic is a core part of the winter season for airlines. ""With this being severely depressed by shattered confidence and restrictions, we need winter support measures to help us weather the storm of Omicron uncertainty."" The advertising regulator has cleared Tesco's Christmas TV campaign featuring Father Christmas bearing a Covid vaccine passport after it prompted 5,000 complaints from viewers. The ad, titled This Christmas, Nothing's Stopping Us, shows the supermarket's customers determined to enjoy a proper Christmas with family and friends after last year's Covid-related restrictions. However, in one scene a reporter appears on TV with ""breaking news"", telling viewers that ""Santa could be quarantined"".
Father Christmas is then shown presenting his Covid pass at border control, proving he has been vaccinated to a customs officer so he can enter the country without restriction. Commenting on complaints that the ad is coercive and encourages medical discrimination, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) says the advert ""doesn't break our rules and there are no grounds for further action"". ""In summary, we consider that the depiction of Santa displaying a proof of vaccine status in an airport is likely to be seen as a humorous reference to international travel rules people have experienced this year; it is unlikely to be interpreted as a message about these rules or the Covid-19 vaccine more widely. ""While we understand that some people disagree with the vaccine programme and may find the ad in poor taste, we have concluded that the ad is unlikely to be seen as irresponsible or cause serious or widespread offence on the basis suggested."" As the debate over Christmas parties rumbles on (No 10 says, for now, they should take place), Transport for London (TfL) is already looking ahead to New Year's Eve. Whether Londoners will be out socialising amid the spread of Omicron remains unclear, but one thing that is certain is that free Tube travel on New Year's Eve has been scrapped for the second year in a row. This is due to the ""catastrophic impact of the pandemic"" on finances, TfL says. Normally London's Underground is free from 23:45 GMT until 04:30 GMT. Services will still run through the night but usual fares will apply. It is the second year of no free travel, but last year's celebrations were restricted due to the pandemic. This year a ticketedcelebration at Trafalgar Square replacesthe annual fireworks display on the Thames. Read the full story. Covid measures have been strengthened in response to concern over the newly identified Omicron variant. Let's have a look at what the rules are in the UK. The rules in England changed this week, meaning that face coverings are once again compulsory in shops and on public transport. Anyone entering the UK also now requires a PCR test within 48 hours of arrival and must self-isolate until they have a negative result. The 10 day self-isolation rule has also been brought in again for all contacts of suspected Omicron cases. Face coverings are already mandatory in shops, health and social care settings and on public transport in Wales. But First Minister Mark Drakeford has urged people to ""think carefully"" about whether to meet vulnerable relatives over Christmas. In Northern Ireland either proof of vaccination, a negative lateral flow test or a positive PCR test in the past 30-180 days is now needed to access some venues and events. And the Covid booster programme is being expanded in England and Scotland. The Scottish government has also set up ""enhanced surveillance"" in a bid to identify cases quickly and break chains of transmission. You can read more about the latest restrictionshere. This video can not be played We've heard from the prime minister this afternoon on whether Christmas parties and gatherings should be cancelled, in light of the new Omicron variant. People ""shouldn't be cancelling things, there is no need for that"", Boris Johnson says during a visit to St Thomas' Hospital to get his booster jab. ""The most important thing is people should follow the guidance we have set out,"" he says. He insists that the government is taking a ""balanced and proportionate approach to the risk"". Asked why he was refusing to discuss reports that a Downing Street gathering on 18 December 2020 broke the guidance in place at the time, the prime minister refuses to engage. One source told the BBC that ""several dozen"" people were at the event, where party games were played, and food and drink was served. Families who lost loved ones during the pandemic have said they are ""sickened"" by a No 10 Christmas party held during last year's Covid restrictions. The party took place on 18 December, when such events were banned, with a source telling the BBC ""several dozen"" people attended. Boris Johnson said on Wednesday no rules were broken but, pressed on the issue at PMQs, did not deny a party took place. Downing Street has refused to explain how the staff party was in-keeping with the rules. The Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group has called for an apology from Johnson. One of its spokespeople, Safiah Ngah, tells the BBC: ""My dad died in February from Covid-19, despite being in good health. The last Christmas period is sadly one I will never forget. ""One in 20 people in my borough had Covid-19 and my family were desperately trying to do what we could to keep each other safe. Unfortunately it wasn't enough. ""To think that just a few miles away, No 10 was throwing a 'Christmas Party', with no care for the rules they had set, is sickening."" A further 53,945 coronavirus cases have been recorded in the UK, official figures show. It is the highest daily total since 17 July, when 54,674 were recorded. There have also been a further 141 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test result. We've been hearing a lot about Christmas parties today and whether companies should host them this year. A UK minister who says it is up to individual businesses to decide whether to have a Christmas party this year says he has cancelled his own. Science minister George Freeman earlier told LBC Radio: ""I can tell you that my parliamentary team and I normally have a Christmas party. ""We've decided this year that it is probably sensible to do it by Zoom and wait for the spring. It won't be the best party in the world. ""But... we don't want to be telling every individual business what they should or shouldn't be doing. It is a matter for them."" It comes after the prime minister and health secretary said there wasno need to cancel Christmas parties. Sir Martin Sorrell, of advertising agency S4Capital, is urging the government to offer clear guidance to businesses who he says are seeing a ""sharp series of cancellations"" in Christmas parties since the emergence of the Omicron variant. Mandatory vaccinations may be needed to combat the spread of Covid cases in Germany, an ICU doctor tells the BBC. Chancellor Angela Merkel says a vaccine mandate could be imposed from February next year, if approved by parliament. Dr Hans Bodeker, a hospital consultant in Dresden, Saxony - which has the highest infection rate in the country - says a rise in hospitalisations is being driven by unvaccinated people. The surge has made him change his mind about forced vaccinations. ""If you had asked me a few weeks ago, I would have said no I don't want that. [But] at the moment I think it's the only way to get out of the situation is vaccinating, vaccinating, and probably it needs to be mandatory to heighten rates,"" he tells the BBC World Service's OS programme. Bodeker says scepticism about the government and mainstream media is making young people unsure about getting jabbed. ""People are living in their social media bubble - and they think the danger is coming not from the virus but from the vaccination. It's horrible."" Norway has announced strict new Covid measures in Oslo and nearby areas after a suspected cluster of Omicron cases was found in the capital. People have been ordered to wear masks in public places and work from home where possible. Travellers arriving in Norway must do a Covid test within 24 hours of arrival. The measures come as officials raise alarm over a possible Omicron cluster among dozens of people who attended a Christmas dinner in the capital. Up to 50 people who were at the event have since tested positive, and at least one of them has the new variant, city officials say. If the new strain is detected among all of them, it would be the one of the largest known outbreaks of the new variant in Europe. Mining company Anglo American, which employs 95,000 people worldwide, is the latest business topropose making vaccination mandatory. The Daily Telegraph reported thatinternal documents said workers who refused to get jabbed could be fired,external""as a last resort"". The company said it is consulting with staff on the policy, after encouraging workers over the last 18 months to get vaccinated and setting up facilities to give the jab at some of its sites. ""Requiring vaccination for access is the next step, given that vaccination is the best defence available,"" Anglo American said. The company has a large presence in southern Africa, where the new coronavirus variant Omicron was found to be circulating last week. It also has its headquarters in London and employs about 1,300 workers at the Woodsmith mine project in North Yorkshire. Anglo American said the policy may vary according to local laws and requirements. Vaccination rates in Africa are still dangerously low, a leading World Health Organization (WHO) official said. ""It is almost one year since the world's first Covid-19 shot was given. Yet, Africa has made little inroads in the path to providing vaccine protection,"" said Dr Salam Gueye, the WHO regional emergency director for Africa. Only 102 million people in Africa - just 7.5% of the continent's population - are fully vaccinated, he said. More than 80% have not received even a single dose, he added. ""This is a dangerously wide gap,"" he said, adding that there has been a welcome increase in vaccine supplies in the last three months. Professor Salim Abdool Karim, who is a South African epidemiologist and a member of the Africa Task Force for Coronavirus, tells the BBC there are no ""red flags"" yet with the new Omicron variant. Although transmission rates are high, the new strain appears to be similar to previous variants, Karim tells Newsday. But he cautions that as yet the evidence is only anecdotal, ""so it needs to be taken with a lot of caution"". He says doctors are seeing cases ""that are very similar to what we have seen before"". Doctors are not seeing as many cases with loss of smell or taste, but mainly more common symptoms, he says, adding severe cases could come a bit later. ""By the time people get so sick they need to be hospitalised, it's three or four weeks later. We haven't seen that picture yet,"" he says. ""But the feedback we're getting from the ground is that we are not seeing any red flags, we are not seeing anything dramatically different."" Reality Check Back to South Africa now. While there have been problems with uneven supplies of vaccines in South Africa, the fact its government has had to delay the delivery of doses suggests there is also something else going on. South Africa's Health Minister Joe Phaahla suggests ""fake news"" is playing a role in making people - especially younger age groups - unsure about the vaccine. There is a lot of fear,external- sometimes driven by misinformation or a lack of good information - about the safety of the vaccine. Serious complications are extremely rare,,externalbased on evidence from wide-scale clinical trials and the billions already jabbed, and pale in comparison to the complications from Covid, even in younger people. Some of the claims circulating are outright false, but some are based on an element of truth - that you can still get Covid after being vaccinated, for example. Research in partnership with South Africa's health department found this has led some people to believe vaccines don't work. But that's not the case - you may still catch Covid, but for most people it will be far milder because the vaccine reduces symptoms, keeps people out of hospital and massively reduces deaths from the virus. Read in full:Does southern Africa have enough vaccines? Chancellor Angela Merkel is set to hand over power to her successor Olaf Scholz next week The Covid measures just announced by Germany are an ""act of national solidarity"" in order to ""get the infection rate down and take the pressure off our health system"", Chancellor Angela Merkel says. ""The number
of infections has stabilised, but on a far too high a level,"" she adds. On Thursday, Germany recorded 73,000 new Covid cases and 388 deaths. Just under 70% of Germany's population is vaccinated against Covid - lower than several European countries, including France and the UK. Germany is also restricting the number of people who can meet inside and the country is closing nightclubs in regions with high numbers of cases. Merkel announced the new measures alongside her successor Olaf Scholz, who is set to formally take over as chancellor next week. Scholz says Germany is in a ""very, very difficult situation"" and getting unvaccinated people to get the jab is crucial to halt a new wave of infections. Jenny HillBBC Berlin correspondent Angela Merkel is preparing to
retire from office as Germany faces the worst wave of infection it's experienced
so far in the pandemic. A situation which most experts agree is due â in part â
to the millions of Germans whoâve not yet been vaccinated. Today Merkel and
her soon-to-be successor Olaf Scholz said the German Parliament would vote
on whether to make vaccination mandatory. Thereâs no date, but Merkel
suggested that â if approved â such a measure could be in place by February of
next year. She also announced further restrictions on unvaccinated people
whoâll be banned from many businesses and shops and prohibited from meeting
more than two people from another household. Angela Merkel has always resisted
mandatory vaccination, saying it was the responsibility of government to
persuade citizens. But, asked today whether she now supported the measure, she
replied: ""If I were a member of parliament, I would vote for it."" Germany has announced sweeping new restrictions for people who have not been vaccinated against Covid. Chancellor Angela Merkel says unvaccinated people will be barred from many public places, including non-essential shops and events, unless they have recently recovered from Covid. ""Culture and leisure nationwide will be open only to those who have been vaccinated or recovered,"" Merkel says. ""We have understood that the situation is very serious and
that we want to take further measures in addition to those
already taken,"" she adds. Merkel also says a nationwide
vaccination mandate could be imposed from February 2022, after it's been debated in parliament. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,2.4183718e-08
"Susan Arnold, Disney's chairman-elect Walt Disney has elected a woman to chair its board for the first time in the entertainment giant's 98-year history. Susan Arnold, who has been a Disney board member for 14 years, will succeed Bob Iger at the end of this year. She was formerly an executive at global investment firm Carlyle. Mr Iger, who stepped down as Disney's chief executive in 2020 after 15 years in the role, will leave the company by the end of this month. ""As I step into this new role as chairman of the board, I look forward to continuing to serve the long-term interests of Disney's shareholders and working closely with CEO Bob Chapek as he builds upon the company's century-long legacy of creative excellence and innovation,""Ms Arnold said in a statement,external. She has also served in senior roles at some of America's biggest companies. For the last eight years Ms Arnold has been an executive at Carlyle Group, having previously held roles at consumer goods giant Procter and Gamble and fast food chain McDonald's. ""Susan is an incredibly esteemed executive whose wealth of experience, unwavering integrity, and expert judgment have been invaluable to the company since she first joined the Board in 2007,"" Mr Iger said. Her appointment comes as large companies are moving away from management structures where the chief executive and chairperson roles are held by the same person after pressure from corporate governance experts, investors and, in some cases, regulators to separate the two key positions. Mr Iger's exit marks the end of an era for Disney, who has been in a senior role at the company since 1996. In his time as chief executive Disney made a number of major acquisitions, including the takeovers of Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm and 21st Century Fox. In 2016, the firm opened its first theme park and resort in mainland China. Several other Disney executives have announced plans to leave by the end of this year, including studios head Alan Horn, president and chief creative officer of Disney Branded Television Gary Marsh and company general counsel Alan Braverman.

"This video can not be played Watch our exclusive interview with Pfizer's CEO as he hits out at the fake news that his wife died from the vaccine People will be likely to need to have annual Covid vaccinations for many years to come, the head of Pfizer has told the BBC Dr Albert Bourla said he thought this would be needed to maintain a ""very high level of protection"". The UK has now secured an extra 114 million doses of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to be delivered over the next two years. A year ago the UK was the first country to approve the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. How worrying is the new Covid variant? Will our vaccines still work against Covid variants? Pfizers's chief executive was speaking to the BBC before the emergence of the Omicron variant, first identified in South Africa and also before the announcement that the UK government had signed contracts to buy the 54 million additional Pfizer-BioNTech and 60 million Moderna doses for 2022 and 2023. These deals include access to modified vaccines if needed to combat Omicron and future variants of concern, the Department of Health has said. Dr Bourla said Pfizer had already made updated vaccines in response to the Beta, also first identified in South Africa, and Delta, first identified in India, variants but that they had not been needed. The company is now working on an updated jab in response to the Omicron variant that could be ready in 100 days. He said vaccines had helped save millions of lives during the pandemic, and without them the ""fundamental structure of our society would be threatened"" By the end of the year Pfizer expects to have supplied three billion doses of its messenger ribonucleic-acid (mRNA) vaccine with four billion planned for next year. There had been a global race to protect people protected, Dr Bourla said, but in 2022, countries would have ""as many doses as they need"". Several global health charities see the money Pfizer, BioNTech and Moderna are making out of the pandemic as immoral. Pfizer will generate at least $35bn of Covid vaccine sales this year and has seen its share price soar. But while most people in the world have now had at least one Covid jab,in parts of Africa it is less than one person in 20. Many people in Africa remained unvaccinated Dr Bourla was unapologetic about making a profit, saying ""the bottom line is millions of lives were saved."" He continued; ""We have saved the global economy trillions of dollars. ""It is a strong incentive for innovation for the next pandemic. ""But people will see that if they step up to the game, to bring something that saves lives and saves money, there is also a financial reward."" He denied profiteering - saying the jab was the ""cost of a takeaway meal"" for richer countries but sold at no profit to low-income ones - but accepted rich countries such as the UK had placed orders early and availability had initially been limited. Having to be stored at -70C, the Pfizer vaccine has been tricky to deploy in countries with limited health services. But within a month or so, Pfizer says it will roll out a new formulation of the vaccine that can be stored for three months in a fridge, which Dr Bourla said, would make a ""huge difference"" for sub-Saharan African countries. Pfizer has also developed an antiviral pill, Paxlovid, which in trialscut hospital admissions and deaths by nearly 90%. It should be approved in the US shortly and the UK government has agreed to buy enough for 250,000 patients. Pfizer is also conducting Covid-vaccine trials in the under-fives. And in October, the United States Food and Drug Administration approved the Pfizer jab for five to 11-year-olds. Immunising that age group in the UK and Europe would be a very good idea, Dr Bourla said. ""Covid in schools is thriving,"" he said. ""This is disturbing, significantly, the educational system, and there are kids that will have severe symptoms. ""So there is no doubt in my mind that the benefits, completely, are in favour of doing it."" The mRNA vaccines, from Pfizer and Moderna have now taken over almost completely from the UK developed Oxford-AstraZeneca jab. And Dr Bourla had a strong message for those who did not want to have vaccines. ""For those that are just afraid, the only emotion of human beings stronger than fear is love,"" he said. ""So I am using always this argument that the decision to get another vaccine is not going to influence only your health, it is going to affect the health of others and particularly the health of the people you love the most, because they are the ones that you will interact with. ""So take the courage to overcome your fears and do the right thing."" He has recently been the target of some bizarre fake news stories, alleging the US Federal Bureau of Investigation had arrested him for fraud and his wife had died as a result of side-effects from the Pfizer vaccine - both untrue. ""In the first news, that I was arrested by the FBI, of course I laughed,"" he said. ""On the second news, that my wife died, with a picture of her, I was really [angry]. ""I worried about my kids, so I tried to call them and I could not get my son on the phone. ""What we had to go through, it is nothing compared to the lives that will be lost because of the rubbish that those people published, because people will really think that my wife died because of the vaccine... and she is fine - she is wonderful."" Update 20 February 2023: Following publication of this article, the opinions expressed by Dr Bourla were the subject of a lengthy complaint to the Prescription Medicines Code of Practice Authority. Ina ruling published in Dec 2022,external, some aspects of the complaint were upheld by the PMCPA Appeal Board. CASES:How many cases are there in your area? VACCINE:When will I get the jab?

"Sandy Birtles says she is worried about rising prices When she goes in to check on him at night, Sandy Birtles says she can hardly see her teenage son for all the layers on his bed. The single mother of two says that the family do all they can to keep warm as the bills continue to rise. ""I do not have the heating on when the kids are at school,"" she said. ""If I'm not running around and clearing up, then I'm wrapping up in a coat."" She said that financial pressures mean she had been ""penny-pinching all the time"", but she said rising energy bills have added to the strain. They have to be careful not to use too much hot water, she said, and when her 15-year-old son wanted to add to his bedding she got him a double duvet. How to save energy at home and help the planet What can I do if my energy supplier goes bust? She is worried that these bills will continue to rise, and a charity has predicted that she - and millions of others - will face a particularly difficult bill shock early next year. National Energy Action has predicted that when domestic energy prices rise in April, it will mean that the typical domestic gas bill will have doubled in 18 months. The charity, which campaigns for warm, dry homes, used industry data and forecasts to predict that the typical gas bill, for those on standard tariffs, is likely to have gone up from Â£466 a year in October 2020, to Â£944 in April 2022. Catherine Geddes uses blankets to stay warm Catherine Geddes, who lives on her own in Keighley, is also struggling to cover her energy costs and was worried about the likelihood of them continuing to rise sharply. She has found unusual ways to try to keep the cost down. ""I very rarely put the heating on. Basically I wrap myself up in a blanket and I will use the hairdryer to warm me up. ""My anxiety levels are so high. It is just a nightmare."" National Energy Action information on help with energy bills,external Most households pay for their gas and electricity together in a dual-fuel deal. Those who pay a standard tariff are protected by the industry regulator Ofgem's price cap. This was set at its lowest level in October 2020, owing to relatively low wholesale prices faced by suppliers. It meant the typical annual domestic energy bill for millions of households was no higher than Â£1,042 a year. However, it has increased twice since then, most recently its biggest increase to date this October, which meant those on standard tariffs, with typical household levels of energy use, saw an increase of Â£139 to Â£1,277 a year. There is widespread expectation that owing to soaring wholesale gas prices in recent months the next price cap in April will be set at a much higher level than now. National Energy Action has predicted that this is likely to be a Â£550 a year increase for a typical standard tariff dual fuel customer. ""The cost of living in the UK is at its highest level in a decade with household energy bills the biggest driver. When the costs of essential services go up, those on lowest incomes get hit hardest,"" said Adam Scorer, the charity's chief executive. ""For people already on a budgetary knife-edge, the cost of keeping a family warm has exploded while budgets have collapsed. No amount of useful tips or savvy shopping can cope with that."" The existence of the price cap has delayed the impact of surging wholesale prices on household bills. However, it has also been blamed as creating an unmanageable market by some of the smaller energy firms which have collapsed during the current crisis. Their customers have been moved onto tariffs with other suppliers, in line with the price cap. As a result, hundreds of thousands of people who might have expected to be protected from price rises as they were on a fixed rate will now also be hit by the April price rise. In October, Ofgem chief executive Jonathan Brearley told the BBC that the price cap was there to stop firms making unfair profits, but ""legitimate costs have to be passed through"". He said it was too early to say how much the rise in April would be or whether Ofgem would have to review the price cap more frequently in future. Energy UK, which represents the industry, has said that anyone who is struggling to pay for their energy bill should call their supplier for support. ""Suppliers have put forward more support for customers who might be struggling with their bills this year, and we are currently working with consumer groups to help raise awareness of the help that is available,"" said Emma Pinchbeck, Energy UK's chief executive.
