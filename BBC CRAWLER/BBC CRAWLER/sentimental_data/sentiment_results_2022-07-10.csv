"Willie Walsh said Heathrow Airport could have prepared better to welcome back passengers The price of airline tickets will go up ""without doubt"" as fuel costs rise, an air industry boss has warned. Oil prices have jumped as economies recover from the Covid pandemic and due to the war in Ukraine. These costs will be passed on to consumers, Willie Walsh, director general of the International Air Transport Association (IATA), said. The ex-British Airways boss also said Heathrow Airport ""should have prepared better"" to avoid recent disruption. But Heathrow said Mr Walsh's comments were ""ill-informed"". Holidaymakers need to be prepared for the cost of flights to go up, Mr Walsh told the BBC Sunday Morning programme. ""Flying will be more expensive for consumers, without doubt"", he said, adding that the ""high price of oil"" will be ""reflected in higher ticket prices"". Will my summer holiday flights be cancelled? Jet2 says airports 'woefully ill-prepared' Oil prices were already rising as demand picked up again in economies that had started recovering from the Covid pandemic. The fallout from the war in Ukraine has pushed prices up further. The US has announced a complete ban on oil imports from Russia, with the UK is to phase out Russian supplies by the end of the year. European Union leaders have said they will block most Russian oil imports by the end of 2022. This means demand for oil from other producers has increased, leading to higher prices. Mr Walsh said fuel prices were at record highs, and that ""oil is the single biggest element of an airline's cost base"". ""It's inevitable that ultimately the high oil prices will be passed through to consumers in higher ticket prices."" Alongside ticket price rises, UK airline passengers have had to deal with flight cancellations amid major disruption at some airports, including at Heathrow, Gatwick and Manchester. Mr Walsh said passengers whose flights are cancelled may not have to pay more to rebook. Willie Walsh headed up BA's parent company IAG before becoming the boss of IATA But he said airports which ""cannot cope"" should adjust their schedules now, ""so that they can accommodate as many people as possible"". He singled out Heathrow in particular which has had problems recently with aircraft fuelling and its baggage system. ""Heathrow definitely should have prepared better,"" Mr Walsh said. ""They were arguing that airlines should be operating at least 80% of their slots through the summer period. ""They clearly did not provide sufficient resources to deal with that level of activity, so you would have to be critical of Heathrow."" Mr Walsh admitted that many of the issues affecting airlines and airports were caused by staffing problems, but said he had ""no regrets"" about making deep cuts to British Airways' headcount during the pandemic, when he was the boss of the airline. Heathrow Airport hit back at Mr Walsh's comments on Sunday. ""Aviation is under considerable pressure as demand ramps up - at Heathrow we've faced 40 years of growth in just four months - and what we need is collaborative working and investment in services to protect passengers, not ill-informed comments from retired airline bosses seeking to justify their own bonuses,"" said a Heathrow spokesperson. ""Unlike Mr Walsh, our overriding concern is not a blame game or abdication of responsibility, but what is in passengers' best interest."" The spokesperson added that Heathrow had requested that airlines ""limit demand in line with capacity and this has enabled the vast majority of travellers to get away smoothly in recent months"". ""The most significant risk to travel remains airspace constraints across Europe and a lack of airline ground handling staff. ""We will work closely with all our airport partners and take action where needed, to ensure we can give passengers the safe and reliable journey they deserve this summer,"" the spokesperson said.

"Charles Leclerc (left), Max Verstappen (right) and Lewis Hamilton (centre) filled the podium places in Austria on Sunday Formula 1 will investigate claims that some spectators at the Austrian Grand Prix suffered discriminatory abuse. Lewis Hamilton was one of those to call for action, saying he was ""disgusted and disappointed"" by the reports. ""Something must be done to ensure races are safe spaces for all,"" he added. Formula 1's statement read: ""We take these matters very seriously, have raised them with the promoter and event security, and will be speaking to those who reported them."" It added that the reported behaviour was ""unacceptable and will not be tolerated"". Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said: ""We are shocked to hear that there have been some incidents of abusive behaviour in the grandstands and the fan parks. This is completely unacceptable and we hope that security and the authorities deal with this swiftly as there is no place for it in racing or society as a whole. ""We value inclusion and want a safe space for fans to enjoy our sport."" Ferrari added in a Twitter post: ""There is no room for abuse either verbal or physical against any group of people in sport. Therefore we stand together with F1 in stating that this behaviour is completely unacceptable."" Leclerc wins in Austria to revive title hopes Aston Martin driver Sebastian Vettel said after the race Formula 1 should take a ""zero tolerance"" stance on discriminatory abuse and hand out lifetime bans to any fans who are found guilty. ""I think it is good that this stuff comes out, that's the start, but it is horrible,"" said the four-time world champion, who finished 17th at the Red Bull Ring. ""Whoever these people are, they should be ashamed of themselves and they should be banned from racing events for their lives. ""I think there should be zero tolerance. If people have a good time and drink too much that's OK, but it doesn't justify or excuse wrong behaviour. ""We race as one, so the fans are a part of that."" The top three drivers in Austria were also asked to give their thoughts on what the sport should do to tackle any appropriate behaviour fans experienced during a race weekend. ""As Formula 1, if we manage to find these people, we need to take hard actions, they shouldn't be allowed to be anywhere close to our sport,"" said winner Charles Leclerc. Max Verstappen, who finished second in front a huge crowd at the home of Red Bull, said a possible issue may lie in the consumption of alcohol over the course of a three-day event. The Dutchman added: ""I think one thing can be improved, maybe with security around places, you know, to keep people more in check. ""And also don't forget, it's not an excuse, but of course, they watch the races and then they go back and party and have fun and drink alcohol. And sometimes when you drink alcohol, you can do stupid things. I don't say this as an excuse but also these things can be regulated."" Hamilton added that not enough had been done to continue the message of inclusion within Formula 1. ""We Race as One was all good and well, but it was just words,"" said the seven-time world champion. ""It didn't actually do anything; there was no funding towards anything; there was no programme to actually create change and spark that conversation. ""So, definitely need to utilise our platforms... we really have to step up and actually really start actioning some of the things we're saying."" Hamilton's crash left him ninth on the grid for Saturday's sprint race Earlier in the weekend, Hamilton criticised spectators at the Red Bull Ring for cheering when he crashed in qualifying. Hamilton went off at Turn Seven, close to grandstands packed with Dutch fans of his 2021 title rival Max Verstappen. ""I was going through a bunch of stuff in the crash, but to hear it afterwards you know... I don't agree with any of that, no matter what,"" he said. ""A driver could have been in hospital, and you are going to cheer that?"" The incident left Hamilton 10th in qualifying, although he was promoted to ninth on the grid for Saturday's sprint event after a penalty for Red Bull's Sergio Perez, qualified eighth and took third place in Sunday's race. Vettel handed suspended fine for briefing walk-out Speaking after the sprint, Hamilton added: ""It's just mind-blowing that people would do that, knowing how dangerous our sport is. I'm grateful that I wasn't in hospital and I wasn't heavily injured. ""You should never cheer someone's downfall or someone's injury.""

"This video can not be played Watch: Sajid Javid says tax cuts are needed before growth Conservative leadership hopefuls have been setting out competing plans to cut taxes, as the race to replace Boris Johnson heats up. A flurry of weekend announcements has seen most candidates promise cuts for individuals, businesses, or both. But divisions have opened up over the timing and scale of the proposed reductions. They also mark a contrast with ex-chancellor Rishi Sunak, who has played down the prospect of immediate cuts. Meanwhile the contest has widened further, with Trade Minister Penny Mordaunt becoming the ninth Tory MP to throw her hat into the ring. The Brexit-supporting former defence secretary launched her campaign on Sunday, styling herself as a pragmatist and a team player. Javid and Hunt join Tory leadership race Who could be the next prime minister? Political landscape being re-shaped before our eyes She joins a field of contenders that has increased significantly in recent days, with an official timetable for the contest set to be confirmed next week. As well as Mr Sunak, his successor Nadhim Zahawi, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, and former health secretaries Sajid Javid and Jeremy Hunt have all launched campaigns for the top job. They join Attorney General Suella Braverman, former equalities minister Kemi Badenoch and backbencher Tom Tugendhat - with Foreign Secretary Liz Truss expected to launch her campaign within the next 24 hours. WatchBoris Johnson Quits: What Next & More Questionson iPlayer. Mr Javid has promised wide-ranging tax cuts, including cancelling next year's scheduled hike in corporation tax from 19% to 25%, and instead gradually reduce it by 1p a year to 15%. He also wants to bring forward next year'splanned 1p cut to income taxand reverse April's National Insurance hike, introduced when he was health secretary to fund the NHS and social care. Speaking on the BBC's Sunday Morning programme, he said those proposed cuts would cost Â£39bn a year. In addition, he also wants to cut fuel duty. Arguing the cuts were required to boost growth in the UK economy, he said not introducing them was a ""much greater risk"". Pressed on how he would fund them, he said he would be setting out details in the coming days, but pointed to official projections of a Â£30bn ""fiscal headroom"" against spending targets by 2024. Penny Mordaunt, the latest candidate to enter the race, has been MP for Portsmouth North since 2010. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank, said the Â£30bn figure was calculated at a time when inflation predictions were lower. Writing on Twitter,external, he added that using the headroom to fund tax cuts would ""almost certainly"" require public-sector pay cuts or more borrowing. ""Everyone would like lower taxes. But [we] need to be clear about consequences,"" he added. Mr Hunt, a former foreign and health secretary, has set out a rival plan to reduce corporation tax to 15% in one go at the Budget this autumn. He says that, if elected, he would also freeze business rates - a tax on commercial property - for the poorest areas for five years. And in another dividing line with Mr Javid, he has said any cuts to income tax should depend on achieving economic growth first. He also revealed that if he becomes leader he would make Tatton MP Esther McVey - who founded the ""blue collar"" group aiming to target working-class voters - his deputy prime minister. This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt says he wants ""smart tax cuts that grow the economy"" Mr Zahawi, who announced his leadership bid on Saturday, has pledged to cut taxes for ""individuals, families and businesses,"" and Mr Shapps has promised to cut personal tax for the poorest. Responding to newspaper reports that the authorities are looking into his tax affairs, Mr Zahawi issued a statement saying he was not aware of any investigation and described the claims as ""smears"". He added he would ""answer any questions"" HM Revenue and Customs had for him and pledged to publish his tax returns every year, if he becomes prime minister ""to reassure colleagues and the wider public"". Mr Shapps told Sophy Ridge on Sky News he would stop next year's corporation tax rise, and the 1p cut to income tax ""should happen now"". Speaking to the same programme, foreign affairs committee chair Tom Tugendhat said he would reverse the National Insurance rise and reduce ""crippling"" fuel taxes. The slew of tax-cutting plans to have been announced so far mark a contrast with Mr Sunak, who has played down the prospect of tax cuts before public finances improve. The former chancellor has not yet set out his economic pitch for the leadership, promising more details in the coming days and weeks. But in a video launching his campaign, he warned against ""comforting fairy tales"" that would ""leave our children worse off tomorrow"". Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper criticised candidates promising to scrap the National Insurance rise, adding they had not joined Labour inopposing it at the time. ""I don't think any of them have put forward any costed proposals,"" she told the Sunday Morning programme. ""While they've been talking about being a low-tax party, they've all been voting for 15 tax rises,"" she added. Launching her leadership bid earlier, former naval reservist Ms Mordaunt emphasised her teambuilding abilities, adding that leadership should be ""less about the leader and more about the ship"". She is yet to announce a policy platform. However in an early mishap shortly after launching, she posted a new version of her campaign video after paralympian Jonnie Peacock asked for footage of him included in the clip to be removed. A new version of the video was posted around two hours later, with footage of cricketer Jonny Bairstow and the Welsh national football team also removed. The timetable and rules for the leadership contest are expected to be announced next week, with the 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs that organises contests meeting late on Monday. It will be a two-stage process, with Conservative MPs whittling down the field to two candidates through successive rounds of voting, before Tory party members choose the winner. While the campaign is yet to formally get under way, Brexit opportunities minister Jacob Rees-Mogg has said people will ""think an election is necessary"" once the race is over. Speaking on Channel 4's Andrew Neil show, he said many candidates would promise they will not call an early general election - but added it was ""highly probable"" one could be held if the polls favour Mr Johnson's successor in the coming months.

"This video can not be played Wimbledon 2022: Watch Novak Djokovic fight back against Nick Kyrgios to win title Wimbledon 2022 on the BBC Venue:All England ClubDates:27 June-10 July Coverage:Live across BBC TV, radio and online with extensive coverage on BBC iPlayer, Red Button, Connected TVs and mobile app. Novak Djokovic underlined his recent dominance at Wimbledon with a composed and controlled fightback against Australia's Nick Kyrgios to win a fourth consecutive men's singles title. Serbia's Djokovic, 35, lost the first set after some superb serving from Kyrgios, but ended up winning 4-6 6-3 6-4 7-6 (7-3) on Centre Court. It is Djokovic's seventh SW19 men's title and only Roger Federer has more. Victory also moved him one behind Rafael Nadal's record 22 men's majors. Top seed Djokovic made a slower start than his 27-year-old opponent, who initially seemed nerveless in his first Grand Slam singles final. But the Serb did not lose belief as he showed all of his experience and nous to turn the match around. ""He's a bit of a god, I'm not going to lie. I thought I played well,"" Kyrgios said as he congratulated Djokovic. Losing his winning position began to irritate Kyrgios, who is known for his fiery temperament as well as his exciting tennis. While Kyrgios increasingly remonstrated with his support team, Djokovic remained cool in the heat of the battle on a scorching Centre Court. After clinching victory with his third match point, Djokovic dropped to his haunches and picked a blade of the Centre Court grass to eat in what has now become a customary celebration. It was a first major win of the year for the Serb, who was stopped from playing in the Australian Open after being deported because of his vaccination status, and lost to Rafael Nadal in the French Open quarter-finals. I needed to weather the storm after Australia - Djokovic 'Ridiculous' I reached Wimbledon final - Kyrgios Barker's final Wimbledon ends in emotional send-off Hewett beaten in dramatic final-set tie-break This video can not be played Wimbledon 2022: Novak Djokovic wins final on his wedding anniversary In temperatures passing 30C in London, a 15,000 near-capacity crowd including royals and celebrities were enthralled in what was surely the hottest ticket in town. Djokovic had joked there would be ""fireworks"" in a match against a player who, like him, has shown the tendency to be combustible on the court. The pair have also had an uneasy relationship in the past, with Kyrgios last year branding Djokovic a ""tool"" and a ""strange cat"". The tension had eased at the All England Club, with Kyrgios revealing a ""bromance"" had developed between the pair before they were seen joking together at their practices on Saturday. The relationship remained cordial when the serious business began on Sunday, both knowing that losing their cool could provide encouragement to their opponent. This video can not be played Wimbledon 2022: Watch Nick Kyrgios reflect on his first Grand Slam final and Novak Djokovic Kyrgios, who had spoken about struggling to sleep because of the excitement of reaching his first major singles final, initially did well to keep his emotions in check. But, as the momentum of the match began to turn, Kyrgios took his frustration out on his family and friends. Having so far been calm and reserved, he began chuntering and gesturing at them midway through the second set. The frustrations reappeared as the third set and fourth-set tie-break moved away from him, with the steely Djokovic drawing out mistakes to seal a 21st major title with the third of five championship points. Djokovic roared towards his box in delight at clinching victory, then put his arm around Kyrgios, who smiled as he received some words - seemingly of encouragement - from his opponent. In his on-court victory speech, Djokovic told Kyrgios he would ""be back"" in a major final. ""It is tough to find consolation words at a moment like this but you showed why you are one of the best players in the world,"" he said. ""I wish you all the best. I respect you a lot and you are a phenomenal talent. ""I never thought I would say so many nice things about you! OK, it's official: it is a bromance."" This video can not be played Wimbledon 2022: Watch Nick Kyrgios complain about fan in final Kyrgios had beaten Djokovic in both of their previous two matches, which came in three-set matches on hard courts. Playing Djokovic over five sets on grass was always likely to be a different proposition. Djokovic had not lost a match at Wimbledon since 2017 - when he retired from a quarter-final against Tomas Berdych - and was going for his 28th consecutive victory on the surface. But Djokovic - regarded as the game's greatest returner - could not live with Kyrgios' serve as the world number 40 made a superb start. Kyrgios broke for a 3-2 lead on the way to taking the opening set and dropped just five points on serve, hitting seven aces and winning 81% of his first-serve points. A delicately-poised third game of the second set swung Djokovic's way as he outlasted Kyrgios in a 23-shot rally and then ended another long duel with a sublime drop shot to clinch the break. That set the platform for the world number three, now fully dialled in, to swing the second set in his favour. Djokovic was unable to convert either of two break points in the first game of the third set, shortly before the match was briefly disrupted by a protester in the stands who was removed from Centre Court by security. Djokovic continued to make Kyrgios work hard for his holds but the set continued on serve until a ninth game where the Australian produced a double fault for break point and then hit a backhand into the net. While Kyrgios ranted again at his box, Djokovic remained calm on his chair as he prepared to serve out for the lead. The Serb managed to block out the drama from his opponent to clinch the third set and, in a sign of his focused state of mind, celebrated with a gentle shake of his racquet. Neither player made much of an impression on the other's serve in the fourth set, leading to a tie-break where Djokovic drew more errors to clinch victory. Nine-time Wimbledon doubles champion Todd Woodbridge on BBC TV Kyrgios came out as he had to, to put the pressure on the champion, with an exceptional array of shots. But then Novak, who we have seen so many times before, came through with the consistency, the determination and the accuracy. There's no indication of Djokovic slowing down. His intention is to continue to go after that (Grand Slam) record. He's got a little closer again now. But when you watch him here on the grass, there's a lot of work to be done by the rest of the field to be able to beat him here at the Championships.

"Robert Buckland agreed to become Welsh secretary after Boris Johnson announced his resignation Standards in public life have been ""a real issue"" during Boris Johnson's leadership, according to the newly appointed Welsh secretary. Sir Robert Buckland said he wanted to see ""a quick return"" to higher standards under the next prime minister. Ex-government minister Stephen Crabb said he always had question marks about Mr Johnson's ability to lead. Labour and Plaid Cymru called for a snap general election. After calling for Boris Johnson's resignation earlier this week, the Llanelli-born MP for South Swindonfilled the Welsh Secretary vacancyto ""serve the country"" rather than to ""prop Boris Johnson up"". Why true blue county voters turned against Johnson 'More drama in Johnson downfall than Love Island' PM's behaviour irrational, says top Welsh Tory Asked on theBBC Politics Wales programmewhether public standards had been degraded during Boris Johnson's leadership, Mr Buckland said standards had been a ""real issue of concern and debate"". ""I personally think the Conservatives should embody the highest standards in public life,"" he said. Conservative MPs says standard were as issue with Boris Johnson as leader ""I think part of the tradition of being Conservative is about respect for institutions, respect for the office, and respect for political opponents and I want to see a quick return to that,"" he added. Mr Buckland said he wanted to ""have a business-like relationship with the first minister and the government of Wales"" and ""not just fly the flag for Wales but to try and draw in as much investment and support as possible"". As the number ofleadership contenders continues to growMr Buckland did not rule himself out as a candidate. ""Well, who knows - I've learnt to expect the unexpected,"" he said. Ex-minister Stephen Crabb says trust was 'draining away' during Mr Johnson's time as Conservative leader Stephen Crabb, who served as Welsh Secretary and Work and Pensions Secretary during David Cameron's tenure, said he was ""never a huge believer"" in Boris Johnson. Speaking to Politics Wales, Mr Crabb said: ""I didn't support him in the 2019 election because I had real question marks about his ability to run a really effective and efficient administration. ""He obviously won an incredible mandate in the 2019 general election... which was impressive and was one of the things that did bind the party together. ""But what we've had over the last eight months, in particular, is a steady draining away of trust and goodwill,"" he added. He said he ""never felt that comfortable"" with Boris Johnson's ""very punchy, very pugnacious"" style of government. As for policy direction, he said he was ""just sceptical of boiling down very, very complicated, difficult challenges into simple slogans and propositions"". The Preseli Pembrokeshire MP said: ""I don't want to see any Conservative candidate going out there and trying to pretend that really big, difficult challenges are easy and can be solved with a few simple words and a few simple slogans. Montgomeryshire MP Craig Williams is backing Rishi Sunak as the next Conservative leader ""We do need really honesty about the nature of the challenges facing the country,"" he added. ""I really want to hear from them their plans for the union because, I think, at times over the last few years, I think there's been an insensitivity towards different parts of the union and I want to see that we have a new Conservative leader that can be a compelling face for UK government in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland."" Mr Crabb is yet to decide which candidate to support. Former Welsh Secretary Simon Hart announced he was backing Rishi Sunak. On Sunday, Mr Hart tweeted a photo of himself bearing the slogan ""Ready for Rishi!"" beneath the words: ""Only Rishi has the experience, values and vision to be our next prime minister.""

Labour and Plaid Cymru want a snap election following Mr Johnson's departure Labour's Shadow Welsh Secretary Jo Stevens MP said: ""Why should the public put up with him [Boris Johnson] for another three months, squatting in Downing Street, when he's unfit to be prime minister? ""What damage, what more damage, is he going to do in the next three months? ""He needs to go now and we need not just a change at the top of government, we need a completely new government, and that's why we need a general election,"" she added. Plaid Cymru's Westminster Leader Liz Saville-Roberts MP said: ""Surely if Conservative MPs have seen the light with Boris Johnson and they want him gone, he should be gone in the here and now to make sure that there's none of his malign influence with the next prime minister.

"Uber's embattled chief executive Travis Kalanick has resigned from the firm, following pressure from shareholders. His resignation comes after a chaotic few months at the firm, including a series of scandals about sexual harassment, macho culture and the departure of senior executives. Mr Kalanick had already said that he was taking an indefinite leave of absence following the sudden death of his mother in a boating accident. There is no doubt that Travis Kalanick, the billionaire founder of the Uber lift-sharing platform, built a company that is one of the giants of Silicon Valley. However, recent months have seen him make a series of apologies for both his own behaviour and that of members of his leadership team. Uber now operates in 662 cities around the world and is valued at nearly $70bn (Â£55bn). Mr Kalanick's reputation for ruthlessness and machismo has led to some deeply uncomfortable reports about the culture inside Uber: with persistent stories about organisational sexism and disputes with drivers over their terms and with local authorities and taxi companies. ""Travis's biggest strength is that he will run through a wall to accomplish his goals,"" investor and mentor  Mark Cubantold the New York Times,external. ""Travis's biggest weakness is that he will run through a wall to accomplish his goals. That's the best way to describe him."" Travis Kalanick's informal ""bro-like"" tone has not always helped. Ina widely reported email to staff ahead of a company party in Miami in 2013,external, Mr Kalanick - known as TK - asked employees not to have sex with each other if they were in the ""same chain of command"" or to throw beer kegs off tall buildings, and levied a $200 (Â£158) ""puke charge"" for anyone who was sick, presumably as a result of over-indulgence. Arianna Huffington has said Travis Kalanick needs to change his leadership style It's difficult to imagine Apple's Tim Cook or Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg writing a similar missive. Board member Arianna Huffington said in March that Mr Kalanick needed to evolve his leadership style from ""scrappy entrepreneur"" to ""leader of a major global company."" President Jeff Jones is one of a stream of executives who have parted ways with the company in recent months. Mr Jones left after less than one year in post. ""It is now clear... that the beliefs and approach to leadership that have guided my career are inconsistent with what I saw and experienced at Uber, and I can no longer continue as president of the ride-sharing business,""he said in a statement to Recode,external. Mr Kalanick himself acknowledged that he needed to ""grow up"", aftera video of him swearing at an Uber driver,externalin a row over rates was shared online. He said he was ""ashamed"" of his behaviour and accepted that he needed ""leadership help"". He now has a private driver. It has been claimed that Mr Kalanick saw the medical records of a woman who accused an Uber driver of rape in India, after they wereobtained by Uber Asia executive Eric Alexander,external. Uber did not comment directly but confirmed that Mr Alexander no longer worked there. In February 2017,a blog post by former Uber engineer Susan J Fowler,external, which documented her experiences of sexism at Uber, went viral. It led to Mr Kalanick launching an investigation into the culture of the organisation. He described her experiences as ""abhorrent"" and against the company's values. Another Uber employeewho wrote about her time there,externalsaid it had been suggested to her - by another woman - that a male manager couldn't look her in the eye because she was wearing a sleeveless tank top. There are other anecdotes about Uber's attitude to women that have raised eyebrows. During aninterview with the magazine GQ,externalin 2014, Mr Kalanick joked about a service for women on demand, which he nicknamed ""Boob-er"". Uber chief Kalanick may face bumpy ride Dear Travis... leadership tips for Uber's beleaguered boss Uber investigates 'abhorrent' sexism claims Ex-girlfriend Gabi Holzwarth recalledgoing with Mr Kalanick and a team of employees to an escort-karaoke bar in Korea,externalwhere women sat in a circle at the bar, wearing tags with numbers on them. He did not get involved and the pair did not stay for long. She said she had later been asked by senior vice-president Emil Michael to tell reporters they had sung karaoke and ""had a good time"". Mr Michael said this was not his recollection of the conversation. Uber said the event had been reported to human resources and the workplace culture report investigators. Mr Michael left the company on 12 June. Also in 2014, a promotion by Uber in Lyon promised to pair riders with ""hot chick"" drivers for a maximum period of 20 minutes  -Buzzfeed obtained screenshots,externalof the blog post, subsequently deleted, which featured models in lingerie. The same year Emil Michael suggested at a dinner that the company should hire researchers to dig dirt on its critics, singling out one female journalist in particular. Mr Michael later apologised for the ""off the record"" remarks. Some of Uber's operations under Travis Kalanick's watch have been in decidedly grey areas. The New York Times revealed that it had beenusing a computer program called Greyball, which it claimed had been used to identify officials trying to catch its drivers and deny them service in areas where Uber had not yet been authorised. Uber said the program had been used to prevent ""fraudulent users"" from violating its terms. Apple forbids apps from tracking its devices It was also reported thatApple boss Tim Cook had personally intervenedwhen his company had discovered Uber had been using ""fingerprinting"" code to track iPhones by collecting their serial numbers, which is against the terms of the app store. Uber claimed the process deterred criminals from installing its app on stolen handsets. Waymo, the self-driving car firm owned by Google's parent firm Alphabet, has accused Uber of stealing trade secrets. In court, Waymo alleged that Anthony Levandowski, a former employee, downloaded 14,000 confidential files before leaving the company in 2016 and later joining Uber to head up its self-driving car project. Uber denies receiving or using stolen technology. In May 2017 itfired Mr Levandowski for allegedly declining to assist in its investigation relating to the lawsuit. An Uber driverless car in San Francisco The idea of driverless cars was never going to sit well with Uber's thousands of drivers, even though it appealed to its investors, and the company approached it with the steamrolling tactics favoured by Mr Kalanick. A research collaboration with Carnegie Mellon University's robotics centre soured after 40 of its researchers and scientists left to join the ride-sharing firm. Uber was criticised for raising prices during heavy snow in New York Uber has also been criticised over its price-surging policy, where the price of a journey goes up if it is in high demand. On that subject, Mr Kalanick was unapologetic. ""We did more trips because of our approach, not fewer,"" hetold Wired following a price surge during heavy snow in New York in 2013.,external ""We gave people more options to get around, and that is the whole fricking goal."" Perhaps it is his burning ambition to meet that one ""fricking goal"" that might ultimately have driven Travis Kalanick to bad behaviour. ""We characterise him as aggressive, dog-eat-dog, and he's obviously an extremely driven individual, that's how he's achieved what he's achieved,"" said John Blakey, executive coach and author of The Trusted Executive, in a recent BBC interview. ""[But] what got you here, won't get you there. Those attributes - the challenge, the boldness, the brashness - to get to the next stage of the game, he has to recognise he needs new qualities.""

"Uber's co-founder Travis Kalanick is to step down from its board at the end of the year. The 43-year-old ousted the ride-hailing firm's original chief executive within a year of its creation, but was himself forced tostand down six-and-a-half years later in 2017after a number of scandals. He had, however, remained involved as one of its nine directors. Mr Kalanick also recently sold off most of his shares in the company. In the past two months he has liquidated about $2.5bn (Â£1.9bn) worth of stock, representing more than 90% of his earlier stake in the business. ""At the close of the decade, and with the company now public, it seems like the right moment for me to focus on my current business and philanthropic pursuits,""said Mr Kalanick in a statement issued by Uber,external. ""I will continue to cheer for its future from the sidelines."" Uber promises changes to avoid Germany ban Uber had 6,000 US sexual assault reports in two years Uber loses licence to operate in London Mr Kalanick currently heads up City Storage Systems. The Los Angeles-based start-up buys up land and establishes kitchens for use by delivery-only restaurants, which operate via apps including Uber Eats. The entrepreneur had previously declared: ""I love Uber more than anything in the world."" However, investors pressured him to step aside in the run up to the company's flotation following a series of controversies. They had involved: a report that another executive had obtained the medical records of a woman who was raped by an Uber driver in 2014, and then shared them with Mr Kalanick among others hundreds of complaints from staff about harassment and bullying a legal dispute with Google's parent company Alphabet over the alleged theft of trade secrets related to driverless cars an argument between Mr Kalanick and one of Uber's San Francisco drivers over fares, which was filmed and released to the media Mr Kalanick had also repeatedly clashed with regulators, which had helped Uber overcome and sometimes ignore restrictions that would have otherwise prevented it entering some markets. But there was a perception that the company's image had been tarnished as a consequence, and that his replacement - Expedia's former chief Dara Khosrowshahi - would be seen as a less risky bet by the markets once the firm had listed. But Mr Khosrowshahi has paid his own respects following the latest announcement. ""Very few entrepreneurs have built something as profound as Travis Kalanick did with Uber,"" he said. ""I'm enormously grateful for Travis' vision and tenacity while building Uber, and for his expertise as a board member."" Mr Khosrowshahi has faced issues of his own, including one of Uber's test self-drive cars killing a woman, and Transport for London (TfL) deciding not to renew the company's licence to operate in the capital.

"The files show Emmanuel Macron was on first name terms with Uber's founder while ex-EU commissioner Neelie Kroes secretly lobbied for the firm Thousands of leaked files have exposed how Uber courted top politicians, and how far it went to avoid justice. They detail the extensive help Uber got from leaders such as Emmanuel Macron and ex-EU commissioner Neelie Kroes. They also show how the taxi firm's former boss personally ordered the use of a ""kill switch"" to prevent raiding police from accessing computers. Uber says its ""past behaviour wasn't in line with present values"" and it is a ""different company"" today. The Uber Files are a trove of more than 124,000 records, including 83,000 emails and 1,000 other files involving conversations, spanning 2013 to 2017. They were leaked tothe Guardian,external, and shared with theInternational Consortium of Investigative Journalists,externaland a number of media organisations including BBC Panorama. They reveal, for the first time, how a $90m-a-year lobbying and public relations effort recruited friendly politicians to help in its campaign to disrupt Europe's taxi industry. While French taxi drivers staged sometimes violent protests in the streets against Uber, Mr Macron - now president - was on first name terms with Uber's controversial boss Travis Kalanick, and told him he would reform laws in the firm's favour. Uber's ruthless business methods were widely known, but for the first time the files give a unique inside view of the lengths it went to in achieving its goals. UBER FILES:Tech firm lobbied top ministers at undeclared meetings UBER FILES:Greyballing, kill switches, lobbying - Uber's dark tricks revealed They show how ex-EU digital commissioner Neelie Kroes, one of Brussels' top officials, was in talks to join Uber before her term ended - and then secretly lobbied for the firm, in potential breach of EU ethics rules. At the time, Uber was not just one of the world's fastest-growing companies - it was one of the most controversial, dogged by court cases, allegations of sexual harassment, and data breach scandals. Eventually shareholders had enough, andTravis Kalanick was forced out in 2017. Uber says his replacement, Dara Khosrowshahi, was ""tasked with transforming every aspect of how Uber operates"" and has ""installed the rigorous controls and compliance necessary to operate as a public company"". Paris was the scene of Uber's first European launch, and it met stiff resistance from the taxi industry, culminating in violent protests in the streets. In August 2014, an ambitious former banker named Emmanuel Macron had just been appointed minister for the economy. He saw Uber as a source of growth and badly needed new jobs, and was keen to help. That October, he held a meeting with Mr Kalanick and other executives and lobbyists, which marked the start of a long - but little-publicised - stint as a champion of the controversial firm's interests within government. Uber lobbyist Mark MacGann described the meeting as ""spectacular. Like I've never seen,"" the files show. ""We will dance soon,"" he added. ""Emmanuel"" and ""Travis"" were soon on first name terms, and met at least four times, the files show - in Paris, and at the World Economic Forum conference in Davos, Switzerland. Only the Davos meeting has been previously reported. At one point Uber wrote to Mr Macron saying it was ""extremely grateful"". ""The openness and welcome we receive is unusual in government-industry relations."" French taxi drivers were particularly enraged by the 2014 launch of UberPop - a service that allowed unlicensed drivers to offer rides, at much lower prices. Courts and parliament banned it, but Uber kept the service running as it challenged the law. Mr Macron didn't think there was a future for UberPop, but he agreed to work with the company to rewrite France's laws governing its other services. ""Uber will provide an outline for a regulatory framework for ridesharing. We will connect our respective teams to start working on a feasible proposal that could become the formal framework in France,"" an email from Travis Kalanick to Mr Macron reads. On 25 June 2015, the protests became violent, and a week later Mr Macron texted Mr Kalanick with an apparent offer of help. Protests against UberPop turned violent. Paris, 25 June 2015 ""[I] will gather everybody next week to prepare the reform and correct the law."" The same day, Uber announced the suspension of UberPop in France. The extent of the now-president of France's relationship with the controversial global firm that was operating in violation of French law has not been revealed until now. A spokesperson for Mr Macron said in an email: ""His functions naturally led him to meet and interact with many companies engaged in the sharp shift which came out during those years in the service sector, which had to be facilitated by unlocking administrative and regulatory hurdles."" Uber said the ""suspension of UberPop was in no way followed by more favourable regulations,"" and a new law that came into force in 2018 resulted in France adopting ""stricter regulations"" that were ""in no way beneficial to Uber"". The files also reveal how Uber's relationship with one of Europe's top officials, European Commission vice-president Neelie Kroes, began significantly earlier and ran deeper than previously was known, putting her in an apparent breach of rules governing commissioners' conduct. They reveal she was in talks to join Uber's advisory board before she even left her last European post in November 2014. EU rules say commissioners have to respect a ""cooling-off"" period, then 18 months, during which new jobs require the approval of the commission. As a commissioner, Ms Kroes oversaw digital and competition policy, and was a high-profile scourge of big tech, playing a leading role in hitting Microsoft andIntel with massive fines,external. But of all the companies she could have worked for after leaving, Uber was a particularly controversial choice. In her home country, the Netherlands, the UberPop ridesharing service had also brought legal and political trouble. Uber drivers were arrested in October 2014, and that December a judge in the Hague banned UberPop, threatening fines up to 100,000 euros. In March 2015, Uber's Amsterdam office was raided by Dutch police. Emails say that Ms Kroes called ministers and other members of the government to persuade them to back down during the raid.During another raid a week later, Ms Kroes again contacted a Dutch minister the Uber Files show, and, in the words of an email, ""harassed"" the head of the Dutch civil service. An internal email advised staff not to discuss her informal relationship externally: ""Her reputation and our ability to negotiate solutions in the Netherlands and elsewhere would suffer from any casual banter inside or outside the office."" The files show that the company wanted Ms Kroes to pass messages on to the office of the Dutch Prime Minister, Mark Rutte. In October 2015, an email reads: ""We'll get backchannel going with Neelie and the PM's Chief of Staff, to extract maximum advantage through 'giving' them the notion of a 'victory'."" She wrote to the commission's Ad Hoc Ethical Committee requesting permission to join Uber's advisory board before the 18 months were up, and appealed to commission president Jean-Claude Juncker. That permission was denied, but documents show Ms Kroes continued to help the company informally until her appointment was announced, shortly after the cooling-off period had ended. This underlines that Ms Kroes was in a ""clear breach"" of the rules, says Alberto Alemanno, Jean Monnet professor of European Union law at HEC Paris. Dutch PM Mark Rutte, Uber's then CEO Travis Kalanick and Neelie Kroes on a visit to Silicon Valley in 2016 ""You're proving the fact that you're doing something you are not allowed to do,"" he told BBC Panorama. ""Because if she didn't necessarily ask for permission, you might still argue there was a grey area, there was a grey zone. But now it's no longer there."" Looking at all the disclosures about Ms Kroes' relationship with Uber, he said: ""It makes me feel that our system is probably not fit for purpose because this situation should have been prevented."" Ms Kroes denies that she had any ""formal or informal role at Uber"" before May 2016, when the cooling-off period expired. She said as an EU commissioner she interacted with numerous technology companies, ""always driven by what I believe would benefit the public interest"". During the cooling off period, the Dutch government appointed her special envoy for start-ups, which involved interactions with a ""wide array of business, government and non-governmental entities"" with the aim of promoting a ""business-friendly and welcoming ecosystem in the Netherlands"", she said. A spokesperson for the Dutch ministry of economic affairs says that ""Uber was not considered a start-up in 2015"". Uber says Ms Kroes left the advisory board in 2018, and says it has since introduced new guidelines ""strengthening oversight"" of ""lobbying and external engagements with policymakers"" in Europe. If the police came knocking, Uber had a second line of defence - the ""kill switch"", which made it impossible for visiting law enforcement to access the company's computers. This would restrict officers' access to sensitive company data, such as lists of drivers, which the company believed would harm its growth. The files confirm earlier news reports about the kill switch, and reveal that Mr Kalanick himself activated the system at least once. ""Please hit the kill switch ASAP. Access must be shut down in AMS [Amsterdam],"" an email from his account says. The kill switch was also used in Canada, Belgium, India, Romania and Hungary, and at least three times in France. Uber says it has had no ""'kill switch' designed to thwart regulatory inquiries anywhere in the world"" since the new chief executive took over in 2017. A spokesperson for Mr Kalanick said he never authorised any actions or programmes that would obstruct justice in any country, and any accusation he did is completely false. He said Uber ""used tools that protect intellectual property and the privacy of their customers"" and that ""these fail-safe protocols do not delete any data or information, and were approved by Uber's legal and regulatory departments"". The Uber Files is a leak of 124,000 records including emails and texts exposing conversations and meetings between Uber executives and public officials as the technology-driven taxi firm sought to expand its business. The files were leaked tothe Guardian,externalwhich shared them with theInternational Consortium of Investigative Journalists,externalin Washington DC and media partners in 29 countries, including the BBC's Panorama.

""Because if she didn't necessarily ask for permission, you might still argue there was a grey area, there was a grey zone. But now it's no longer there."" Looking at all the disclosures about Ms Kroes' relationship with Uber, he said: ""It makes me feel that our system is probably not fit for purpose because this situation should have been prevented."" Ms Kroes denies that she had any ""formal or informal role at Uber"" before May 2016, when the cooling-off period expired. She said as an EU commissioner she interacted with numerous technology companies, ""always driven by what I believe would benefit the public interest"". During the cooling off period, the Dutch government appointed her special envoy for start-ups, which involved interactions with a ""wide array of business, government and non-governmental entities"" with the aim of promoting a ""business-friendly and welcoming ecosystem in the Netherlands"", she said. A spokesperson for the Dutch ministry of economic affairs says that ""Uber was not considered a start-up in 2015"". Uber says Ms Kroes left the advisory board in 2018, and says it has since introduced new guidelines ""strengthening oversight"" of ""lobbying and external engagements with policymakers"" in Europe. If the police came knocking, Uber had a second line of defence - the ""kill switch"", which made it impossible for visiting law enforcement to access the company's computers. This would restrict officers' access to sensitive company data, such as lists of drivers, which the company believed would harm its growth. The files confirm earlier news reports about the kill switch, and reveal that Mr Kalanick himself activated the system at least once. ""Please hit the kill switch ASAP. Access must be shut down in AMS [Amsterdam],"" an email from his account says. The kill switch was also used in Canada, Belgium, India, Romania and Hungary, and at least three times in France. Uber says it has had no ""'kill switch' designed to thwart regulatory inquiries anywhere in the world"" since the new chief executive took over in 2017. A spokesperson for Mr Kalanick said he never authorised any actions or programmes that would obstruct justice in any country, and any accusation he did is completely false. He said Uber ""used tools that protect intellectual property and the privacy of their customers"" and that ""these fail-safe protocols do not delete any data or information, and were approved by Uber's legal and regulatory departments"". The Uber Files is a leak of 124,000 records including emails and texts exposing conversations and meetings between Uber executives and public officials as the technology-driven taxi firm sought to expand its business. The files were leaked tothe Guardian,externalwhich shared them with theInternational Consortium of Investigative Journalists,externalin Washington DC and media partners in 29 countries, including the BBC's Panorama.

"Uber has been valued at $82bn (Â£63bn) ahead of its share listing in what is expected to be one of the biggest stock market flotations this year. The ride-hailing app is asking investors to pay $45 a share, at the lower end of the price range expected. Uber's conservative price is an attempt to avoid the fate of rival Lyft whose shares fell by up to a third after its recent listing, said analysts. Uber is yet to make a profit and warned recently it may never do so. Since its foundation in 2009, the company has lost about $9bn. Daniel Ives, an analyst at investment company Wedbush Securities, said the lower-than-expected valuation was Uber's attempt to deflect scrutiny of its financial performance. ""They know that they are going to have a target on their back in terms of, not just investors, but regulators as well as drivers, so they need to tread carefully here in terms of how they price it. ""Their success is not going to be determined over the coming days or weeks or months, it's really over the coming years. But the last thing they want is for stock to drop through the IPO price like Lyft has,"" he said. What do drivers think of Uber? Is Uber really worth billions of dollars? Are internet unicorns really worth billions? Uber had originally suggested a price range of between $44-$50 for its share price listing, valuing the company at up to $120bn. Investors are betting on Uber's growth prospects as it diversifies into several other sectors. As well as the original ""ride-hailing"" business, Uber is developing driverless cars, and has a food delivery operation, Uber Eats. Union organiser Lydia Hughes joined Uber drivers in their strike in London on Wednesday Uber's chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, has emphasised that the firm's future is not as a ride-hailing company, but as a wide technology platform shaping logistics and transportation. But Brian Hamilton, a tech entrepreneur and founder of data firm Sageworks, said its losses were hard to overlook. ""Uber is basically Lyft 2.0. Good model, growing sales. But, yet again, here comes California math once more. It is still losing a ton of money,"" he said. The firm's revenue last year surged 42% to $11.3bn, but its adjusted loss - following a tax benefit - still hit $1.8bn. In the first three months of the year, it was a similar story with the firm reporting a loss of around $1bn. The firm's flotation comesdays after drivers in the US and UK went on strikeover pay and working conditions. Unions are urging Uber to cut the rate of commission it takes, to increase the average fare rate and for better job security. What do drivers think of Uber? Is Uber really worth billions of dollars?

"Uber's embattled chief executive Travis Kalanick has resigned from the firm, following pressure from shareholders. His resignation comes after a chaotic few months at the firm, including a series of scandals about sexual harassment, macho culture and the departure of senior executives. Mr Kalanick had already said that he was taking an indefinite leave of absence following the sudden death of his mother in a boating accident. There is no doubt that Travis Kalanick, the billionaire founder of the Uber lift-sharing platform, built a company that is one of the giants of Silicon Valley. However, recent months have seen him make a series of apologies for both his own behaviour and that of members of his leadership team. Uber now operates in 662 cities around the world and is valued at nearly $70bn (Â£55bn). Mr Kalanick's reputation for ruthlessness and machismo has led to some deeply uncomfortable reports about the culture inside Uber: with persistent stories about organisational sexism and disputes with drivers over their terms and with local authorities and taxi companies. ""Travis's biggest strength is that he will run through a wall to accomplish his goals,"" investor and mentor  Mark Cubantold the New York Times,external. ""Travis's biggest weakness is that he will run through a wall to accomplish his goals. That's the best way to describe him."" Travis Kalanick's informal ""bro-like"" tone has not always helped. Ina widely reported email to staff ahead of a company party in Miami in 2013,external, Mr Kalanick - known as TK - asked employees not to have sex with each other if they were in the ""same chain of command"" or to throw beer kegs off tall buildings, and levied a $200 (Â£158) ""puke charge"" for anyone who was sick, presumably as a result of over-indulgence. Arianna Huffington has said Travis Kalanick needs to change his leadership style It's difficult to imagine Apple's Tim Cook or Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg writing a similar missive. Board member Arianna Huffington said in March that Mr Kalanick needed to evolve his leadership style from ""scrappy entrepreneur"" to ""leader of a major global company."" President Jeff Jones is one of a stream of executives who have parted ways with the company in recent months. Mr Jones left after less than one year in post. ""It is now clear... that the beliefs and approach to leadership that have guided my career are inconsistent with what I saw and experienced at Uber, and I can no longer continue as president of the ride-sharing business,""he said in a statement to Recode,external. Mr Kalanick himself acknowledged that he needed to ""grow up"", aftera video of him swearing at an Uber driver,externalin a row over rates was shared online. He said he was ""ashamed"" of his behaviour and accepted that he needed ""leadership help"". He now has a private driver. It has been claimed that Mr Kalanick saw the medical records of a woman who accused an Uber driver of rape in India, after they wereobtained by Uber Asia executive Eric Alexander,external. Uber did not comment directly but confirmed that Mr Alexander no longer worked there. In February 2017,a blog post by former Uber engineer Susan J Fowler,external, which documented her experiences of sexism at Uber, went viral. It led to Mr Kalanick launching an investigation into the culture of the organisation. He described her experiences as ""abhorrent"" and against the company's values. Another Uber employeewho wrote about her time there,externalsaid it had been suggested to her - by another woman - that a male manager couldn't look her in the eye because she was wearing a sleeveless tank top. There are other anecdotes about Uber's attitude to women that have raised eyebrows. During aninterview with the magazine GQ,externalin 2014, Mr Kalanick joked about a service for women on demand, which he nicknamed ""Boob-er"". Uber chief Kalanick may face bumpy ride Dear Travis... leadership tips for Uber's beleaguered boss Uber investigates 'abhorrent' sexism claims Ex-girlfriend Gabi Holzwarth recalledgoing with Mr Kalanick and a team of employees to an escort-karaoke bar in Korea,externalwhere women sat in a circle at the bar, wearing tags with numbers on them. He did not get involved and the pair did not stay for long. She said she had later been asked by senior vice-president Emil Michael to tell reporters they had sung karaoke and ""had a good time"". Mr Michael said this was not his recollection of the conversation. Uber said the event had been reported to human resources and the workplace culture report investigators. Mr Michael left the company on 12 June. Also in 2014, a promotion by Uber in Lyon promised to pair riders with ""hot chick"" drivers for a maximum period of 20 minutes  -Buzzfeed obtained screenshots,externalof the blog post, subsequently deleted, which featured models in lingerie. The same year Emil Michael suggested at a dinner that the company should hire researchers to dig dirt on its critics, singling out one female journalist in particular. Mr Michael later apologised for the ""off the record"" remarks. Some of Uber's operations under Travis Kalanick's watch have been in decidedly grey areas. The New York Times revealed that it had beenusing a computer program called Greyball, which it claimed had been used to identify officials trying to catch its drivers and deny them service in areas where Uber had not yet been authorised. Uber said the program had been used to prevent ""fraudulent users"" from violating its terms. Apple forbids apps from tracking its devices It was also reported thatApple boss Tim Cook had personally intervenedwhen his company had discovered Uber had been using ""fingerprinting"" code to track iPhones by collecting their serial numbers, which is against the terms of the app store. Uber claimed the process deterred criminals from installing its app on stolen handsets. Waymo, the self-driving car firm owned by Google's parent firm Alphabet, has accused Uber of stealing trade secrets. In court, Waymo alleged that Anthony Levandowski, a former employee, downloaded 14,000 confidential files before leaving the company in 2016 and later joining Uber to head up its self-driving car project. Uber denies receiving or using stolen technology. In May 2017 itfired Mr Levandowski for allegedly declining to assist in its investigation relating to the lawsuit. An Uber driverless car in San Francisco The idea of driverless cars was never going to sit well with Uber's thousands of drivers, even though it appealed to its investors, and the company approached it with the steamrolling tactics favoured by Mr Kalanick. A research collaboration with Carnegie Mellon University's robotics centre soured after 40 of its researchers and scientists left to join the ride-sharing firm. Uber was criticised for raising prices during heavy snow in New York Uber has also been criticised over its price-surging policy, where the price of a journey goes up if it is in high demand. On that subject, Mr Kalanick was unapologetic. ""We did more trips because of our approach, not fewer,"" hetold Wired following a price surge during heavy snow in New York in 2013.,external ""We gave people more options to get around, and that is the whole fricking goal."" Perhaps it is his burning ambition to meet that one ""fricking goal"" that might ultimately have driven Travis Kalanick to bad behaviour. ""We characterise him as aggressive, dog-eat-dog, and he's obviously an extremely driven individual, that's how he's achieved what he's achieved,"" said John Blakey, executive coach and author of The Trusted Executive, in a recent BBC interview. ""[But] what got you here, won't get you there. Those attributes - the challenge, the boldness, the brashness - to get to the next stage of the game, he has to recognise he needs new qualities.""

"Uber's co-founder Travis Kalanick is to step down from its board at the end of the year. The 43-year-old ousted the ride-hailing firm's original chief executive within a year of its creation, but was himself forced tostand down six-and-a-half years later in 2017after a number of scandals. He had, however, remained involved as one of its nine directors. Mr Kalanick also recently sold off most of his shares in the company. In the past two months he has liquidated about $2.5bn (Â£1.9bn) worth of stock, representing more than 90% of his earlier stake in the business. ""At the close of the decade, and with the company now public, it seems like the right moment for me to focus on my current business and philanthropic pursuits,""said Mr Kalanick in a statement issued by Uber,external. ""I will continue to cheer for its future from the sidelines."" Uber promises changes to avoid Germany ban Uber had 6,000 US sexual assault reports in two years Uber loses licence to operate in London Mr Kalanick currently heads up City Storage Systems. The Los Angeles-based start-up buys up land and establishes kitchens for use by delivery-only restaurants, which operate via apps including Uber Eats. The entrepreneur had previously declared: ""I love Uber more than anything in the world."" However, investors pressured him to step aside in the run up to the company's flotation following a series of controversies. They had involved: a report that another executive had obtained the medical records of a woman who was raped by an Uber driver in 2014, and then shared them with Mr Kalanick among others hundreds of complaints from staff about harassment and bullying a legal dispute with Google's parent company Alphabet over the alleged theft of trade secrets related to driverless cars an argument between Mr Kalanick and one of Uber's San Francisco drivers over fares, which was filmed and released to the media Mr Kalanick had also repeatedly clashed with regulators, which had helped Uber overcome and sometimes ignore restrictions that would have otherwise prevented it entering some markets. But there was a perception that the company's image had been tarnished as a consequence, and that his replacement - Expedia's former chief Dara Khosrowshahi - would be seen as a less risky bet by the markets once the firm had listed. But Mr Khosrowshahi has paid his own respects following the latest announcement. ""Very few entrepreneurs have built something as profound as Travis Kalanick did with Uber,"" he said. ""I'm enormously grateful for Travis' vision and tenacity while building Uber, and for his expertise as a board member."" Mr Khosrowshahi has faced issues of his own, including one of Uber's test self-drive cars killing a woman, and Transport for London (TfL) deciding not to renew the company's licence to operate in the capital.

"This video can not be played Watch: Sajid Javid says tax cuts are needed before growth Conservative leadership hopefuls have been setting out competing plans to cut taxes, as the race to replace Boris Johnson heats up. A flurry of weekend announcements has seen most candidates promise cuts for individuals, businesses, or both. But divisions have opened up over the timing and scale of the proposed reductions. They also mark a contrast with ex-chancellor Rishi Sunak, who has played down the prospect of immediate cuts. Meanwhile the contest has widened further, with Trade Minister Penny Mordaunt becoming the ninth Tory MP to throw her hat into the ring. The Brexit-supporting former defence secretary launched her campaign on Sunday, styling herself as a pragmatist and a team player. Javid and Hunt join Tory leadership race Who could be the next prime minister? Political landscape being re-shaped before our eyes She joins a field of contenders that has increased significantly in recent days, with an official timetable for the contest set to be confirmed next week. As well as Mr Sunak, his successor Nadhim Zahawi, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, and former health secretaries Sajid Javid and Jeremy Hunt have all launched campaigns for the top job. They join Attorney General Suella Braverman, former equalities minister Kemi Badenoch and backbencher Tom Tugendhat - with Foreign Secretary Liz Truss expected to launch her campaign within the next 24 hours. WatchBoris Johnson Quits: What Next & More Questionson iPlayer. Mr Javid has promised wide-ranging tax cuts, including cancelling next year's scheduled hike in corporation tax from 19% to 25%, and instead gradually reduce it by 1p a year to 15%. He also wants to bring forward next year'splanned 1p cut to income taxand reverse April's National Insurance hike, introduced when he was health secretary to fund the NHS and social care. Speaking on the BBC's Sunday Morning programme, he said those proposed cuts would cost Â£39bn a year. In addition, he also wants to cut fuel duty. Arguing the cuts were required to boost growth in the UK economy, he said not introducing them was a ""much greater risk"". Pressed on how he would fund them, he said he would be setting out details in the coming days, but pointed to official projections of a Â£30bn ""fiscal headroom"" against spending targets by 2024. Penny Mordaunt, the latest candidate to enter the race, has been MP for Portsmouth North since 2010. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank, said the Â£30bn figure was calculated at a time when inflation predictions were lower. Writing on Twitter,external, he added that using the headroom to fund tax cuts would ""almost certainly"" require public-sector pay cuts or more borrowing. ""Everyone would like lower taxes. But [we] need to be clear about consequences,"" he added. Mr Hunt, a former foreign and health secretary, has set out a rival plan to reduce corporation tax to 15% in one go at the Budget this autumn. He says that, if elected, he would also freeze business rates - a tax on commercial property - for the poorest areas for five years. And in another dividing line with Mr Javid, he has said any cuts to income tax should depend on achieving economic growth first. He also revealed that if he becomes leader he would make Tatton MP Esther McVey - who founded the ""blue collar"" group aiming to target working-class voters - his deputy prime minister. This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt says he wants ""smart tax cuts that grow the economy"" Mr Zahawi, who announced his leadership bid on Saturday, has pledged to cut taxes for ""individuals, families and businesses,"" and Mr Shapps has promised to cut personal tax for the poorest. Responding to newspaper reports that the authorities are looking into his tax affairs, Mr Zahawi issued a statement saying he was not aware of any investigation and described the claims as ""smears"". He added he would ""answer any questions"" HM Revenue and Customs had for him and pledged to publish his tax returns every year, if he becomes prime minister ""to reassure colleagues and the wider public"". Mr Shapps told Sophy Ridge on Sky News he would stop next year's corporation tax rise, and the 1p cut to income tax ""should happen now"". Speaking to the same programme, foreign affairs committee chair Tom Tugendhat said he would reverse the National Insurance rise and reduce ""crippling"" fuel taxes. The slew of tax-cutting plans to have been announced so far mark a contrast with Mr Sunak, who has played down the prospect of tax cuts before public finances improve. The former chancellor has not yet set out his economic pitch for the leadership, promising more details in the coming days and weeks. But in a video launching his campaign, he warned against ""comforting fairy tales"" that would ""leave our children worse off tomorrow"". Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper criticised candidates promising to scrap the National Insurance rise, adding they had not joined Labour inopposing it at the time. ""I don't think any of them have put forward any costed proposals,"" she told the Sunday Morning programme. ""While they've been talking about being a low-tax party, they've all been voting for 15 tax rises,"" she added. Launching her leadership bid earlier, former naval reservist Ms Mordaunt emphasised her teambuilding abilities, adding that leadership should be ""less about the leader and more about the ship"". She is yet to announce a policy platform. However in an early mishap shortly after launching, she posted a new version of her campaign video after paralympian Jonnie Peacock asked for footage of him included in the clip to be removed. A new version of the video was posted around two hours later, with footage of cricketer Jonny Bairstow and the Welsh national football team also removed. The timetable and rules for the leadership contest are expected to be announced next week, with the 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs that organises contests meeting late on Monday. It will be a two-stage process, with Conservative MPs whittling down the field to two candidates through successive rounds of voting, before Tory party members choose the winner. While the campaign is yet to formally get under way, Brexit opportunities minister Jacob Rees-Mogg has said people will ""think an election is necessary"" once the race is over. Speaking on Channel 4's Andrew Neil show, he said many candidates would promise they will not call an early general election - but added it was ""highly probable"" one could be held if the polls favour Mr Johnson's successor in the coming months.

"Charles Leclerc (left), Max Verstappen (right) and Lewis Hamilton (centre) filled the podium places in Austria on Sunday Formula 1 will investigate claims that some spectators at the Austrian Grand Prix suffered discriminatory abuse. Lewis Hamilton was one of those to call for action, saying he was ""disgusted and disappointed"" by the reports. ""Something must be done to ensure races are safe spaces for all,"" he added. Formula 1's statement read: ""We take these matters very seriously, have raised them with the promoter and event security, and will be speaking to those who reported them."" It added that the reported behaviour was ""unacceptable and will not be tolerated"". Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said: ""We are shocked to hear that there have been some incidents of abusive behaviour in the grandstands and the fan parks. This is completely unacceptable and we hope that security and the authorities deal with this swiftly as there is no place for it in racing or society as a whole. ""We value inclusion and want a safe space for fans to enjoy our sport."" Ferrari added in a Twitter post: ""There is no room for abuse either verbal or physical against any group of people in sport. Therefore we stand together with F1 in stating that this behaviour is completely unacceptable."" Leclerc wins in Austria to revive title hopes Aston Martin driver Sebastian Vettel said after the race Formula 1 should take a ""zero tolerance"" stance on discriminatory abuse and hand out lifetime bans to any fans who are found guilty. ""I think it is good that this stuff comes out, that's the start, but it is horrible,"" said the four-time world champion, who finished 17th at the Red Bull Ring. ""Whoever these people are, they should be ashamed of themselves and they should be banned from racing events for their lives. ""I think there should be zero tolerance. If people have a good time and drink too much that's OK, but it doesn't justify or excuse wrong behaviour. ""We race as one, so the fans are a part of that."" The top three drivers in Austria were also asked to give their thoughts on what the sport should do to tackle any appropriate behaviour fans experienced during a race weekend. ""As Formula 1, if we manage to find these people, we need to take hard actions, they shouldn't be allowed to be anywhere close to our sport,"" said winner Charles Leclerc. Max Verstappen, who finished second in front a huge crowd at the home of Red Bull, said a possible issue may lie in the consumption of alcohol over the course of a three-day event. The Dutchman added: ""I think one thing can be improved, maybe with security around places, you know, to keep people more in check. ""And also don't forget, it's not an excuse, but of course, they watch the races and then they go back and party and have fun and drink alcohol. And sometimes when you drink alcohol, you can do stupid things. I don't say this as an excuse but also these things can be regulated."" Hamilton added that not enough had been done to continue the message of inclusion within Formula 1. ""We Race as One was all good and well, but it was just words,"" said the seven-time world champion. ""It didn't actually do anything; there was no funding towards anything; there was no programme to actually create change and spark that conversation. ""So, definitely need to utilise our platforms... we really have to step up and actually really start actioning some of the things we're saying."" Hamilton's crash left him ninth on the grid for Saturday's sprint race Earlier in the weekend, Hamilton criticised spectators at the Red Bull Ring for cheering when he crashed in qualifying. Hamilton went off at Turn Seven, close to grandstands packed with Dutch fans of his 2021 title rival Max Verstappen. ""I was going through a bunch of stuff in the crash, but to hear it afterwards you know... I don't agree with any of that, no matter what,"" he said. ""A driver could have been in hospital, and you are going to cheer that?"" The incident left Hamilton 10th in qualifying, although he was promoted to ninth on the grid for Saturday's sprint event after a penalty for Red Bull's Sergio Perez, qualified eighth and took third place in Sunday's race. Vettel handed suspended fine for briefing walk-out Speaking after the sprint, Hamilton added: ""It's just mind-blowing that people would do that, knowing how dangerous our sport is. I'm grateful that I wasn't in hospital and I wasn't heavily injured. ""You should never cheer someone's downfall or someone's injury.""

"Two of the RAF's F-35Bs will be taking part in the exercises Six Royal Air Force fighter jets have flown to Finland and Sweden for joint training exercises, the MoD has said. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said the deployment, which came at the request of both nations, underlined the UK's commitment to strengthening collective defence capabilities. The exercise also follows the countries' applications to join Nato following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Two cutting-edge F-35 jets are among the aircraft taking part.

""These deployments highlight our determination to enhance that partnership and ensure our forces can work together seamlessly,"" he added.

Finland has recently announced plans to purchase its own F-35s, a single-seat fighter jet produced by US aerospace firm Lockheed Martin. The aircraft are the UK's most advanced and expensive jets. Costing almost Â£100m each, they can land vertically - similar to the Harrier Jump Jet - and combine radar-evading stealth technology with supersonic speeds. The exercises represent a ""practical demonstration"" of the mutual security assurance declarations the UK signed with Finland and Sweden in May, the MoD said.

"Charles Leclerc (left), Max Verstappen (right) and Lewis Hamilton (centre) filled the podium places in Austria on Sunday Formula 1 will investigate claims that some spectators at the Austrian Grand Prix suffered discriminatory abuse. Lewis Hamilton was one of those to call for action, saying he was ""disgusted and disappointed"" by the reports. ""Something must be done to ensure races are safe spaces for all,"" he added. Formula 1's statement read: ""We take these matters very seriously, have raised them with the promoter and event security, and will be speaking to those who reported them."" It added that the reported behaviour was ""unacceptable and will not be tolerated"". Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said: ""We are shocked to hear that there have been some incidents of abusive behaviour in the grandstands and the fan parks. This is completely unacceptable and we hope that security and the authorities deal with this swiftly as there is no place for it in racing or society as a whole. ""We value inclusion and want a safe space for fans to enjoy our sport."" Ferrari added in a Twitter post: ""There is no room for abuse either verbal or physical against any group of people in sport. Therefore we stand together with F1 in stating that this behaviour is completely unacceptable."" Leclerc wins in Austria to revive title hopes Aston Martin driver Sebastian Vettel said after the race Formula 1 should take a ""zero tolerance"" stance on discriminatory abuse and hand out lifetime bans to any fans who are found guilty. ""I think it is good that this stuff comes out, that's the start, but it is horrible,"" said the four-time world champion, who finished 17th at the Red Bull Ring. ""Whoever these people are, they should be ashamed of themselves and they should be banned from racing events for their lives. ""I think there should be zero tolerance. If people have a good time and drink too much that's OK, but it doesn't justify or excuse wrong behaviour. ""We race as one, so the fans are a part of that."" The top three drivers in Austria were also asked to give their thoughts on what the sport should do to tackle any appropriate behaviour fans experienced during a race weekend. ""As Formula 1, if we manage to find these people, we need to take hard actions, they shouldn't be allowed to be anywhere close to our sport,"" said winner Charles Leclerc. Max Verstappen, who finished second in front a huge crowd at the home of Red Bull, said a possible issue may lie in the consumption of alcohol over the course of a three-day event. The Dutchman added: ""I think one thing can be improved, maybe with security around places, you know, to keep people more in check. ""And also don't forget, it's not an excuse, but of course, they watch the races and then they go back and party and have fun and drink alcohol. And sometimes when you drink alcohol, you can do stupid things. I don't say this as an excuse but also these things can be regulated."" Hamilton added that not enough had been done to continue the message of inclusion within Formula 1. ""We Race as One was all good and well, but it was just words,"" said the seven-time world champion. ""It didn't actually do anything; there was no funding towards anything; there was no programme to actually create change and spark that conversation. ""So, definitely need to utilise our platforms... we really have to step up and actually really start actioning some of the things we're saying."" Hamilton's crash left him ninth on the grid for Saturday's sprint race Earlier in the weekend, Hamilton criticised spectators at the Red Bull Ring for cheering when he crashed in qualifying. Hamilton went off at Turn Seven, close to grandstands packed with Dutch fans of his 2021 title rival Max Verstappen. ""I was going through a bunch of stuff in the crash, but to hear it afterwards you know... I don't agree with any of that, no matter what,"" he said. ""A driver could have been in hospital, and you are going to cheer that?"" The incident left Hamilton 10th in qualifying, although he was promoted to ninth on the grid for Saturday's sprint event after a penalty for Red Bull's Sergio Perez, qualified eighth and took third place in Sunday's race. Vettel handed suspended fine for briefing walk-out Speaking after the sprint, Hamilton added: ""It's just mind-blowing that people would do that, knowing how dangerous our sport is. I'm grateful that I wasn't in hospital and I wasn't heavily injured. ""You should never cheer someone's downfall or someone's injury.""

"This video can not be played Watch: The prime minister's home on fire, after protesters broke in and set it alight Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa has announced he will step down after protesters stormed his official residence and set the prime minister's house on fire. Neither the PM nor the president were in the buildings at the time. Hundreds of thousands descended on the capital Colombo, calling for Mr Rajapaksa to resign after months of protests over economic mismanagement. Mr Rajapaksa will step down on 13 July. PM Wickremesinghe has agreed to resign. The speaker of parliament said the president decided to step down ""to ensure a peaceful handover of power"" and called on the public to ""respect the law"". The announcement triggered an eruption of celebratory fireworks in the city. Political leaders are due to hold further meetings to discuss a smooth transition of power. Sri Lanka's military has appealed to people to cooperate with security forces to maintain calm. After Saturday's events, the United States appealed to the Sri Lankan leadership to act promptly to resolve the country's economic crisis. The daily heartbreak of life in a country gone bankrupt Sri Lanka: 'I canât afford milk for my babies' What's behind Sri Lanka's petrol shortage? One protester, Fiona Sirmana, who was demonstrating at the president's house, said it was time ""to get rid of the president and the prime minister and to have a new era for Sri Lanka"". ""I feel very, very sad that they didn't go earlier because had they gone earlier there wouldn't have been any destruction,"" she told Reuters. Dozens of people were injured in Saturday's protests, and a spokesperson for Colombo's main hospital told AFP news agency that three people were being treated for gunshot wounds. Sri Lanka is suffering rampant inflation and is struggling to import food, fuel and medicine amid the country's worst economic crisis in 70 years. It has run out of foreign currency and has had to impose a ban on sales of petrol and diesel for private vehicles, leading to days-long queues for fuel. Protesters made their way into the house, chanting slogans and waving the national flag The extraordinary events of Saturday appeared to be the culmination of months of mainly peaceful protests in Sri Lanka. Huge crowds converged on the official residence of President Rajapaksa, chanting slogans and waving the national flag before breaking through the barricades and entering the property. Footage online showed people roaming through the house and swimming in the president's pool, while others emptied out a chest of drawers, picked through the president's belongings and used his luxurious bathroom. The contrast between the luxury of the palace and the months of hardship endured by the country's 22 million people was not lost on the protesters. ""When the whole country is under such strain people have come here to release that pressure. When you see the luxuries in this house it is obvious that they don't have time to work for the country,"" Chanuka Jayasuriya told Reuters. By Ethirajan Anbarasan, BBC News, Colombo These are some extraordinary times for Sri Lanka. After a day of fury and violence, the two senior leaders of the country have agreed to step down. The news triggered jubilation at the main protest site in Colombo. Firecrackers were set off in many parts of the city. I am at the Galle Face protest site - many protesters have started returning home, thousands are still present. Some have been singing and playing musical instruments, celebrating. What a turnaround of events. A few days ago a photo of President Rajapaksa and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe smiling in parliament was widely shared on social media. Many vented their anger, saying the two men appeared to be happy while millions were struggling to eat three meals a day. But a week is a long time in politics. Read more here. Mr Rajapaksa vacated his official residence on Friday as a safety precaution ahead of the planned protests, two defence ministry sources said, according to Reuters. Although it is Mr Rajapaksa's official residence, he usually sleeps at a separate house nearby. The BBC has been unable to confirm the president's whereabouts. Many protesters posed for selfies after entering the palace Protesters cheer inside the president's residence in Colombo Protesters also set fire to Prime Minister Wickremesinghe's private home in an affluent neighbourhood of Colombo. He said earlier that he was willing to resign to ensure the safety of civilians and to make way for an all-party government, but soon after his announcement videos started circulating of his house up in flames. The prime minister lives with his family in the private home and uses his official residence for official business only. Whether or not the president's and the prime minister's planned resignations will be enough to appease the protesters is not yet clear. ""Just two resignations alone will not satisfy the demands, the demand of a system change, but at least this is a start if the president and the prime minister depart,"" said Bhavani Fonseka, a prominent human rights lawyer in Colombo. ""There has to be a peaceful transition of power which is yet to be seen,"" she warned. Sri Lanka is an island nation off southern India: It won independence from British rule in 1948. Three ethnic groups - Sinhalese, Tamil and Muslim - make up 99% of the country's 22 million population. One family of brothers has dominated for years: Mahinda Rajapaksa became a hero among the majority Sinhalese in 2009 when his government defeated Tamil separatist rebels after years of bitter and bloody civil war. His brother Gotabaya, who was defence secretary at the time, is the current president but says he is standing down. Now an economic crisis has led to fury on the streets: Soaring inflation has meant some foods, medication and fuel are in short supply, there are rolling blackouts and ordinary people have taken to the streets in anger with many blaming the Rajapaksa family and their government for the situation.

"Willie Walsh said Heathrow Airport could have prepared better to welcome back passengers The price of airline tickets will go up ""without doubt"" as fuel costs rise, an air industry boss has warned. Oil prices have jumped as economies recover from the Covid pandemic and due to the war in Ukraine. These costs will be passed on to consumers, Willie Walsh, director general of the International Air Transport Association (IATA), said. The ex-British Airways boss also said Heathrow Airport ""should have prepared better"" to avoid recent disruption. But Heathrow said Mr Walsh's comments were ""ill-informed"". Holidaymakers need to be prepared for the cost of flights to go up, Mr Walsh told the BBC Sunday Morning programme. ""Flying will be more expensive for consumers, without doubt"", he said, adding that the ""high price of oil"" will be ""reflected in higher ticket prices"". Will my summer holiday flights be cancelled? Jet2 says airports 'woefully ill-prepared' Oil prices were already rising as demand picked up again in economies that had started recovering from the Covid pandemic. The fallout from the war in Ukraine has pushed prices up further. The US has announced a complete ban on oil imports from Russia, with the UK is to phase out Russian supplies by the end of the year. European Union leaders have said they will block most Russian oil imports by the end of 2022. This means demand for oil from other producers has increased, leading to higher prices. Mr Walsh said fuel prices were at record highs, and that ""oil is the single biggest element of an airline's cost base"". ""It's inevitable that ultimately the high oil prices will be passed through to consumers in higher ticket prices."" Alongside ticket price rises, UK airline passengers have had to deal with flight cancellations amid major disruption at some airports, including at Heathrow, Gatwick and Manchester. Mr Walsh said passengers whose flights are cancelled may not have to pay more to rebook. Willie Walsh headed up BA's parent company IAG before becoming the boss of IATA But he said airports which ""cannot cope"" should adjust their schedules now, ""so that they can accommodate as many people as possible"". He singled out Heathrow in particular which has had problems recently with aircraft fuelling and its baggage system. ""Heathrow definitely should have prepared better,"" Mr Walsh said. ""They were arguing that airlines should be operating at least 80% of their slots through the summer period. ""They clearly did not provide sufficient resources to deal with that level of activity, so you would have to be critical of Heathrow."" Mr Walsh admitted that many of the issues affecting airlines and airports were caused by staffing problems, but said he had ""no regrets"" about making deep cuts to British Airways' headcount during the pandemic, when he was the boss of the airline. Heathrow Airport hit back at Mr Walsh's comments on Sunday. ""Aviation is under considerable pressure as demand ramps up - at Heathrow we've faced 40 years of growth in just four months - and what we need is collaborative working and investment in services to protect passengers, not ill-informed comments from retired airline bosses seeking to justify their own bonuses,"" said a Heathrow spokesperson. ""Unlike Mr Walsh, our overriding concern is not a blame game or abdication of responsibility, but what is in passengers' best interest."" The spokesperson added that Heathrow had requested that airlines ""limit demand in line with capacity and this has enabled the vast majority of travellers to get away smoothly in recent months"". ""The most significant risk to travel remains airspace constraints across Europe and a lack of airline ground handling staff. ""We will work closely with all our airport partners and take action where needed, to ensure we can give passengers the safe and reliable journey they deserve this summer,"" the spokesperson said.

"Rogers is the mobile carrier for nearly 11 million people in Canada One of Canada's largest mobile and internet providers, Rogers, has apologised for the country-wide outage of its services which began on Friday. The company's CEO Tony Staffieri said the failure followed ""a maintenance update in our core network"". Transport, banking and emergency services were all hit by Friday's blackout, with 911 hotlines and bank ATMs left unavailable. Canadians flocked to coffee shops and libraries to find a connection. The service outage began at 04:30 local time (08:30 GMT) on Friday and lasted for more than 15 hours, but most services have now been restored. Mr Staffieri said the maintenance work ""caused some of our routers to malfunction early Friday morning"". The outage had a huge effect on a wide range of services across Canada, serving as a reminder of how reliant society has become on modern communications. Many 911 services reported difficulties with incoming calls and hospitals asked on-call staff to come into work until the issue was resolved. One mother, Lara Morgan, described how she struggled to contact emergency services after her son was injured in a rugby game with a suspected spinal injury. Speaking to the Globe and Mail newspaper, she said she eventually found someone with a non-Rogers mobile phone to call 911, only to discover that ambulance services also relied on the Rogers network and were having difficulties dispatching paramedics. Her son eventually made it to hospital and was not badly injured. In a statement, Mr Staffieri said the company was ""particularly troubled that some customers could not reach emergency services"". Toronto residents flocked to a local Starbucks to use the internet The outage also caused some events to be cancelled, including the Toronto tour date of Canadian singer The Weeknd. The gig was due to take place at the home of the Toronto Blue Jays, which is owned by Rogers Communications. In the province of Quebec, a Montreal court had to delay a trial hearing for disgraced fashion mogul Peter Nygard after jail officials were unable to connect him to a videoconference system. Critics say the outage demonstrated a need for more competition in the Canadian telecoms sector. Three companies - Rogers, Bell Canada and Telus Corp - control 90% of the market share in Canada. Rogers alone is the mobile carrier of nearly 11 million Canadians, with a stake in everything from hockey to cable television.

"Moira Stuart was awarded an honorary degree of Doctor of Letters by Northumbria University Celebrated broadcaster Moira Stuart has received an honorary degree from Northumbria University. Ms Stuart was the first black newsreader on BBC Radio 4 in 1978 and three years later became the first black woman to front the national news on British television. The university in Newcastle awarded her a Doctor of Letters. The 72-year-old said her career allowed her to ""shift barriers"" and ""change so many stagnant stereotypes"". After accepting her new doctorate at a graduation service in Newcastle, Ms Stuart said: ""I'm so moved by this honour. I'm deeply indebted to [the university's] grace and generosity."" Ms Stuart started at the BBC in the 1970s as a production assistant in BBC Radio's Talks and Documentaries department, before becoming a BBC Radio 4 announcer, newsreader and programme presenter.

"Mourners at the site of the assassination in Nara Japanese police have admitted there were flaws in the security for former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who was shot dead in the southern city of Nara on Friday. ""It is undeniable that there were problems in the security,"" said Nara police chief Tomoaki Onizuka. A gunman opened fire on Abe at a political campaign event - a crime that has profoundly shocked Japan. Sunday's elections for the upper house went ahead as planned. Voting began at 07:00 local time (22:00GMT on Saturday), just two days after Abe's assassination, and closed at 21:00. Exit polls suggested the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), in which Abe was a leading and hugely influential figure, and its junior coalition partner Komeito were set to retain their majority. A moment of silence for Abe was held at the LDP Tokyo headquarters as members waited for the results to come in, Reuters report. Elections for Japan's less-powerful upper house of parliament are typically seen as a referendum on the current government. But a big victory for the LDP would strengthen the current prime minister's ability to push though his key policies, including a doubling of defence spending. Shinzo Abe: The legacy of Japan's longest serving PM A shock killing that could change Japan forever How Shinzo Abe aimed to revitalise Japan's economy World leaders express shock over Abe assassination Police say the suspect, named as Tetsuya Yamagami, 41, held a grudge against a ""specific organisation"". Japanese media quote sources close to the investigation, who say Yamagami believed Abe to be linked to a religious group which, Yamagami alleged, had ruined his mother financially. The suspect has admitted shooting Abe with a homemade gun, according to police. ""The urgent matter is for us to conduct a thorough investigation to clarify what happened,"" police chief Onizuka said, without specifying where he saw failings. He was on the verge of tears, addressing journalists. Yamagami told police he had served in Japan's navy, the Maritime Self-Defense Force, for three years. More recently, he had worked at a factory in western Japan. Abe was Japan's longest-serving prime minister and died aged 67. He was campaigning for the LDP in the run-up to upper house parliamentary elections on Sunday. Current Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, also an LDP member, said he was ""simply speechless"", vowing that Japan's democracy would ""never yield to violence"". Gun violence is extremely rare in Japan, where handguns are banned and incidences of political violence are almost unheard of. The hearse carrying Abe's body arrived at his Tokyo residence on Saturday Police are investigating why Abe was targeted and whether his killer acted alone. Abe was giving a speech on behalf of a political candidate at a road junction when he was shot from behind. Photos show the suspect standing close to Abe moments beforehand. Witnesses described seeing a man carrying a large gun moving within a few metres of Abe and firing twice. The former prime minister fell to the ground as bystanders screamed in shock and disbelief. Security officers dived on to the gunman, who made no attempt to run. The twin-barrelled weapon that killed Abe was crudely made with metal and wood, wrapped in heavy-duty black tape. Several other handmade guns and explosives were later found at the suspect's home. Abe was wounded in the neck and was bleeding profusely as he was airlifted to hospital. He was said to be conscious and responsive in the minutes after the attack, but doctors said no vital signs were detected by the time he was transferred for treatment. Medics worked for hours to save him before he was pronounced dead at 17:03 local time (08:03 GMT) on Friday. The suspect was confronted by a police officer following the shooting On Japanese social media, the hashtag ""We want democracy, not violence"" was trending throughout Friday, with many users expressing their horror and disgust over the incident. In 2014, there were just six incidents of gun deaths in Japan, compared to 33,599 in the US. People have to undergo a strict exam and mental health tests in order to buy a gun. Even then, only shotguns and air rifles are allowed. Abe first held office for a year in 2006 and then again from 2012 to 2020 before stepping down, citing health reasons. While he was in office, he pushed more assertive policies on defence and foreign policy and had long sought to amend Japan's pacifist post-war constitution. He also pushed foran economic policy that came to be known as ""Abenomics"", built on monetary easing, fiscal stimulus and structural reforms.

"This video can not be played Wimbledon 2022: Watch Nick Kyrgios on 'bromance' with Novak Djokovic Wimbledon 2022 men's singles final on the BBC Venue:All England ClubDate:10 JulyTime:14:00 BST Coverage:Live on BBC One from 13:00 BST, with coverage across radio, online, BBC iPlayer, Red Button, Connected TVs and mobile app. Nick Kyrgios says he will be playing for ""the ultimate glory"" and ""tennis immortality"" when he faces Novak Djokovic in the Wimbledon men's final. Serbia's Djokovic is bidding for a fourth consecutive Wimbledon title and a 21st Grand Slam overall on Sunday. Kyrgios is aiming for a first major singles trophy when many thought the mercurial Australian's time had passed. He leads the head-to-head between the pair and Djokovic did not win a set in their two meetings in 2017. However, Djokovic at Wimbledon and in a Grand Slam is a different prospect. He has not lost a match at the Championships since 2017, when he retired through injury in the quarter-finals, and he will be playing in his 32nd major final - a men's record. ""I'm very anxious and nervous,"" Kyrgios told BBC Sport. ""It's something I've never had a chance to do before, play in a Slam final. ""I've been in a lot of finals in my career but this is the first time at Wimbledon, at a Grand Slam, the biggest tournament in the world. That's what kept me up at night - the chance to play for the ultimate glory and become tennis immortality."" Kyrgios, who does not have a coach, says he does not compare himself to Djokovic or the other members of his sport's 'big three' - Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer - because ""they're untouchable"" and that he is doing things differently. ""They're the perfect role models,"" said Kyrgios, who has been fined twice at Wimbledon this year for his on-court behaviour. ""I feel like there's a lot of people who know that's unobtainable so they look at me, who is relatable and has a lot of imperfections, and is still able to go up against the greats and give them a run for their money. ""Wimbledon is clean-cut and you have someone in the final who is edgy, tattoos, not the clean-cut kind of Roger Federer. ""I think that's an inspiration to so many people. I think I have completely done it my way. I've never really listened to any coaches."" The Wimbledon final comes at the end of a week Kyrgios found out he is set to appear in court in Australia next month in relation to an allegation ofcommon assault, something he said had made it ""hard to focus"" on his performances at the tournament. He said he had ""things I want to say"" but had been advised not to by his lawyers, who said he takes the allegations ""very seriously"". Live scores, results and order of play Listen to the latest Wimbledon Daily podcast Alerts: Get tennis news sent to your phone This video can not be played Djokovic predicts 'fireworks' against Kyrgios Djokovic and Kyrgios have moved beyond an initially spiky relationship, with Kyrgios describing the pair as having ""a bit of a bromance now"". Kyrgios previously called Djokovic a ""tool"" and said he would not take advice from someone ""that is partying with his shirt off during a global pandemic"", in reference to a tennis tournament organised by Djokovic that took place in the early months of Covid-19. Djokovic in return said he did not have much respect for Kyrgios away from the court. However, Kyrgios defended Djokovic when the Serb was deported from Australia earlier this year because of not being vaccinated against coronavirus. Kyrgios wrote on Twitter at the time: ""I got vaccinated because of others and for my mum's health, but how we are handling Novak's situation is bad. ""Like these memes, headlines, this is one of our great champions but at the end of the day, he is human. Do better."" Djokovic, who has been limited in which tournaments he can compete in because he has not been vaccinated, got in touch with Kyrgios to thank him for his support. ""I felt like I was almost the only kind of player and someone to stand up for him with all that kind of drama at the Australian Open,"" Kyrgios said. ""I feel like that's where respect is kind of earned. Not on the tennis court, but I feel like when a real-life crisis is happening and someone stands up for you. ""We actually message each other on DMs in Instagram now and stuff. It's real weird. Earlier in the week, he was like, 'hopefully I'll see you Sunday'."" An amused Djokovic responded: ""I don't know if I can call it a bromance yet, but we definitely have a better relationship than what it was probably prior to January this year. ""When it was really tough for me in Australia, he was one of the very few players that came out publicly and supported me and stood by me. I respect him for that a lot."" Kyrgios has long been regarded as a wasted talent - a player who was tipped to win Grand Slams but lacked either the mentality or the focus to do so. He said after his quarter-final that he did not expect to ever reach a major semi-final, let alone a final when Rafael Nadal withdrew injured. However, Kyrgios has credited winning the men's doubles title with close friend Thanasi Kokkinakis in front of raucous crowds at the Australian Open in January with improving his game at Wimbledon. Djokovic, who is two titles behind Rafael Nadal's men's record of 22 majors, will be wary of which Kyrgios will show up to the match and with how much freedom he may play. ""He's a big-match player,"" he said. ""If you see his career, the best tennis he's played is always against the top guys."" Many younger players have appeared awed when facing Djokovic, Nadal or Roger Federer, as though they were almost grateful to be on court with them. That will not be an issue for Kyrgios, says fellow Australian Todd Woodbridge, a 16-time Grand Slam doubles champion and BBC commentator at Wimbledon. ""He knows he's the underdog, but he also has massive confidence in his ability to beat the top guys,"" he said. ""He knows that he's one of the only guys that can do it. That's what he'll take into this match. He plays better with that mindset of, 'yes, underdog, but I'm better. I can beat you and I know you're rattled by me'. That's exactly the mindset that I think he'll bring."" Despite Djokovic being set to play his 32nd Grand Slam final when this is Kyrgios' first, Woodbridge believes it is as ""even-money match"". He says the Serb will have to ""come out sharper"" than he did against Norrie and Jannik Sinner in the quarter-finals, where he trailed by two sets to love, because Kyrgios might not allow him a way back into the match. ""Nick's not going to do that if he gets given a start because he holds serve so much easier,"" said Woodbridge. Having not played since Wednesday, Woodbridge feels the ""four-day break could work against him"" because it has disrupted his ""flow of the tournament"". Managing his emotions over that period, and in the hours before the final on Sunday, will be key to setting him up for the challenge of Djokovic and the occasion. ""Nick has to be able to cope with those hours leading in until the walk-on,"" said Woodbridge. ""They are quite intense in the energy you can consume with nerves. If he can cope with that and not use too much, be relaxed, come out and play a really, really strong opening set, he's got a chance to win. ""I think the opening set, for Nick to win the championship, I really feel he has to win that, to set the tone for the match."" To win that opening set, and go on to win the title, Woodbridge says Kyrgios needs to impose his game on the defending champion. ""He has to play aggressively, he has to serve well, he has to use his forehand,"" he said. ""You don't want to engage in long rallies against Novak because he's better, he moves better and he will wear you down. We know he will last longer in a physical encounter than Nick will. He has to be keeping points short, he has to be dynamic and take some chances. Playing conservatively in a match like this is not going to win you the championship.""

"Rory Stewart's ring could be seen during his appearance on The Andrew Marr Show in 2019 Former Conservative MP Rory Stewart has appealed to the public to help him find his wedding ring, which he ""dropped"" as he left an event. The former Tory cabinet minister said he lost the ring in Buxton, Derbyshire, after giving a talk at the town's Opera House on Saturday afternoon. In a tweet, he said he thought it was ""dropped on St John's Road"", which runs close to the venue. He added he was ""embarrassed"" and would be ""grateful"" for retweets. Mr Stewart, who was the Conservative MP for Penrith and the Border until he wasexpelled from the Tories after he rebelled over Brexit in 2019, said it was ""an old gold ring with a cross on the face"".

Thanks for following along, you can keep up with the latest developmentshere. Today's reporting was brought to you by Jeremy Gahagen, Holly Wallis, Marita Moloney and Jo Couzens. Jeremy Hunt and Sajid Javid both launched their campaign bids on Sunday We'll be ending our live coverage of the leadership contest shortly. Here's a recap of what's happened today: Chris MasonPolitical editor This is the week we found out, barring something totally unforeseen, who will lead the Labour Party into the next general election: Sir Keir Starmer. And we found out who definitely won't be leading the Conservatives into it: Boris Johnson. As the PM's political woes multiplied in recent months, he was, for Labour and others, a political target the size of a barn door. And Starmer sought to define himself as everything Boris Johnson was not. But now, Johnson will soon be the former prime minister, the Labour leader now faces the moving target of a range of possible future ones. And whoever replaces Johnson may not present Starmer with quite the same scope for critique as he's had in recent months. That said, the new Conservative leader won't have a mandate to call their own, and so it will be easier for opponents to question their legitimacy as prime minister. Read more here. Jeremy Hunt is among the candidates doing the rounds on TV and radio today As those entering the running for leader set out their stalls, most of the early pledging has been focused around tax. Many of the declared candidates have already promised to cut taxes on individuals, businesses, or both. Former health secretaries Sajid Javid and Jeremy Hunt have pledged to cut corporation tax - Javid has also promised to bring forward a 1p reduction in income tax to next year. However, Jeremy Hunt tells BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend programme: ""No Conservative should ever promise unfunded tax cuts. It's immoral to load up debt on future generations - my kids, your kids, our grandkids - just for the sake of jam today. ""And so the business tax cuts that I'm proposing are carefully costed. We can do them within the fiscal rules."" But he adds: ""I am passionately in favour of reducing personal taxation. ""But the way you do it is by growing the economy, creating the wealth to make it possible to afford a personal tax cut that will last."" The latest candidate to enter the leadership race, Penny Mordaunt, launched her campaign earlier with a video montage showing the best of Britain. But Paralympian Jonnie Peacock was not best pleased to see a clip of himself sprinting to victory in the 2021 London games in the video, and has requested the footage is removed.

The race is evidently under way - so how will the Tories actually choose a new leader? The timetable for the Conservative leadership race is due to be confirmed on Monday and the new prime minister is expected to be in position by September. People putting themselves forward will first have to secure the backing of Tory MPs before the final two go to a ballot of Conservative members. Under the current rules, candidates need the support of eight Conservative MPs to stand. If there are more than two, Tory MPs hold a series of votes until just two remain. At that point there is a ballot of the wider Conservative Party membership to select the winner. The timescale for each contest is decided by the 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs, and the committee could vote to change the rules before the contest takes place. Attorney General Suella Braverman - the first to throw her hat in the ring for the leadership contest - has been setting out her position on the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). A stauch Brexiteer, Braverman believes the UK ""must fully take back control of our borders"" by ""leaving the jurisdiction of the ECHR"". She says that when people voted for Brexit, they expected this to be done. ""The British people should be able to vote for their priorities and expect that their government can carry them out. This is the definition of taking back control,"" she says. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In recent weeks,the ECHR intervened in a UK court rulingthat would have allowed asylum seekers to be removed to Rwanda - a controversial policy designed to deter smugglers sending people across the English Channel in small boats. ""It is unacceptable"", she says, that ""a foreign court"" was able to stop the first flight to Rwanda. She adds this ""obstruction"" destroys trust in politics. What is the Human Rights Act? This video can not be played Tom Tugendhat has been speaking to BBC News. The tax plans of the leadership contenders once again feature, with Mr Tugendhat pointing out that he hadn't voted in favour of the recent rise in National Insurance. He said the tax rise could inhibit the UK from becoming a ""high-growth"" economy, and he would be ""looking really hard"" at taxes as part of a 10-year economic plan to ensure well-performing public services and a ""strong, more resilient and fairer economy"". Tugendhat also spoke about fuel duty and how the record petrol prices ""had made a difference in my life"". Earlier we reported that Jeremy Hunt has chosen Esther McVey as his deputy prime minister should he win the Tory leadership race. McVey has since written an opinion piece inthe Express,externalin which she says she has not ""sold out"" on her principles by supporting Hunt despite the pair not being ""ideological soulmates"". This ""is not a weakness, it is a strength"", she writes, as ""the Conservative Party is a broad church with a wide base of support and it is essential that we always are"". ""With Jeremy as prime minister, and me serving as his deputy, I believe we can offer the strongest possible appeal to the whole country and to ensure we retain all of our seats at the next General Election with policies and priorities which will resonate in different parts of the country,"" McVey says. She goes on describe what she sees as Hunt's qualities for the top job: work ethic, attention to detail, and an honesty which proves him to be ""a man of impeccable integrity"". Penny Mordaunt is the most recent Tory MP to enter the leadership race Today's Sunday morning was far from easy for those vying for the top job in No 10, with many Tory leadership contenders up and about early outlining why they should be the next prime minister. If you're just joining us, here's a summary of the main developments so far:  You can also read our story on the leadership race here. Therese Coffey says she's proud to be backing her friend Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey says she'd back Foreign Secretary Liz Truss to be the next Tory leader - although Truss hasn't yet declared she's in the running. In a tweet, Coffey says: ""We need a leader who can unite the Red and Blue Wall, has a clear vision for the country and economy, and has the skills and experience to get the tough decisions right. ""Liz's delivery record in government is second to none. She has helped lead the international response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, brokered dozens of post-Brexit trade deals that people thought would be impossible to do. ""Liz is our best chance of winning the next election."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

We know that Boris Johnson has said he will step down as prime minister when a new Conservative Party leader is found. But how will the process unfold? In the past, prime ministers choosing to step down have usually stayed in office until a successor is selected. That means Johnson will stay in position until the Conservatives find a new leader, just as his predecessors Theresa May and David Cameron did when they resigned. It's been suggested that process could last until October, although it could be much shorter - finding May's replacement took two months. In his resignation statement Johnson said: ""I've agreed with Sir Graham Brady, the chairman of our backbench MPs, that the process of choosing that new leader should begin now and the timetable will be announced next week."" Whoever wins the contest to lead the Conservatives will become the leader of the party with the largest number of MPs in Parliament. The Queen will therefore ask them to form a government and they'll become PM. When a prime minister resigns, there is not automatically a general election. The latest an election can be held isJanuary 2025,external, but the new prime minister could choose to call an election before then. Leadership contender Sajid Javid will no doubt be hoping to emulate the viral success of his counterpart Rishi Sunak with his own social media campaign. In the last few minutes, Javid has just resurrected his Team Saj account which lay dormant since July 2019.

In an interview with Sky News' Sophy Ridge on Sunday, he emphasised there would be a ""clean start"" for the government under his stewardship. On whether he would consider cutting corporation tax as prime minister, he said plans by his opponents to do so were ""not realistic unless you have ten-year economic plan"". ""You can't simply look at each of these taxes as a one-off, you need to look at it as part of a whole,"" he said. The reality is this economy needs not only lower taxes for growth, but it also needs sound money, and that is why we need to deliver both.""  Tugendhat also warned against the ""real danger"" of ""chasing inflationary spirals"" when asked if public sector workers should get a pay rise.

""That is not the way to set out a growing economy, that is not the way to restart the economy, that is not the way to get a clean start."" David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent There are nine
official candidates so far in this leadership election, but one very prominent
issue - taxes. This morning we've heard from
two high-profile candidates - both who used to be health secretary. Jeremy Hunt and Sajid Javid. Hunt confirmed a prominent Brexiteer, Esther McVey, would be his deputy prime minister. That's perhaps an attempt to distance himself from his Remain-voting
past. He's promised tax
cuts under his premiership. He's specifically focusing on lowering costs for
business, and argues these sort of changes won't fuel inflation. His rival, Sajid
Javid, is promising Â£39bn of tax cuts, many of them aimed at allowing people to
keep more of their money. He argues it's actually a risk to not do this. He's even changed
his mind on a tax rise introduced in April to help the NHS - the very health
service he was running at the time. They're not alone
in these pledges, most candidates are promising similar. Remember, they're
pitching themselves to Tory members, many who will feel the tax burden is
currently too high. Transport Secretary Grant Shappshas been doing his first media interviews since deciding to run for PM. Speaking to Radio 4's Broadcasting House programme earlier this morning, he set out where he stands on a few major areas. On leadership:Shapps insists he'll deliver competent government, telling the BBC he's got the experience. On tax: Tax cuts are a good lever to get money into people's pockets, says Shapps. He would cut the basic rate of tax from 20p to 19p, and would not put corporation tax up. If he's elected, he'll hold an emergency budget. On Partygate:Asked whether he was lied to by the PM about gatherings happening in Downing Street during lockdown, Shapps says no, adding he's run his own department better. He adds that he wasn't able to see his father in hospital during the pandemic. Northern Ireland:Speaking about the current impasse over the Northern Ireland protocol - part of the UK's Brexit deal governing trade arrangments there - Shapps says he believes we're one United Kingdom, but refuses to reveal his negotiating approach on this matter. Trans issues:Shapps is asked whether a Trans woman is a woman. He says one can't deny biology, adding that he has love and respect for those who change their gender. He says his government will not be obsessed with these issues. Rwanda asylum programme:Shapps says he'll keep the programme under which asylum seekers entering the UK illegally are to be sent to Rwanda where they can progress with their applications. He says this country has a big open heart - with many people including himself hosting Ukrainian refugees in their houses. But an open heart doesn't mean allowing people to die in boats in the English Channel, Shapps adds. General election:People expect us to deliver on the vast majority of the 2019 programme, Shapps says. He plans to make the UK the biggest economy in Europe by 2050. More now on Penny Mordaunt, the Minister for Trade since 2021, who has become the ninth person to join the increasingly crowded Tory leadership race. She was first elected as an MP for Portsmouth North in 2010, and was subsequently re-elected to the same seat every year since. She was made Secretary of State for International Development in 2017 and, in May 2019, she became the first woman to hold the post of Secretary of State for Defence - only to be sacked in July, when Boris Johnson became PM. She later re-entered the Government, becoming Paymaster General in 2020. Mordaunt is a staunch Brexiteer and campaigned for Vote Leave in 2016. In a speech last December, she said that Brexit is not ""an act of self-harm or one that requires us to be punished. It is a massive opportunity to anyone who believes in democracy and the power of trade as a force for good in the world."" In the video she shared on social media announcing her leadership bid, Mordaunt says that ""our leadership has to change. It needs to become a little less about the leader and a lot more about the ship"". Moving away from the Conservative leadership contenders briefly now to the opposition, where Labour has been leading calls for a general election and for the prime minister to depart immediately. ""I think it's in the national interest that Boris Johnson goes. I actually think it's really damaging, him clinging on now,"" Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper tells the BBC. ""We need a change from the last 12 years, not the last 12 months."" She says there is still hope that Johnson will ""do the right thing"" and leave Downing Street quickly, but if he clings to power, Labour will push ahead in calling for a no confidence vote in the prime minister next week. ""That (pushing for a vote of no confidence) is what Keir is proposing but we are hoping the Conservatives will address this at their meeting tomorrow,"" she adds. Should asylum seekers be sent toRwanda?""I agree with that policy."" Would youlock downthe country again if there was another pandemic: ""Not for Covid."" Do you keep the commitment to get tonet zeroby 2050: ""Yes."" Will you scrap theBBC licence fee:""No."" Scottish independence:Javid says the last referendum was supposed to be a once in a generation event so he wouldn't allow another for at least a decade. For how many years were younon-domiciled for taxpurposes in the past?  Javid says this was in the 2000s before public life. He adds he had a job that was international and he lived abroad including in the US and Singapore. In 2009 he moved back to the UK and ever since then he's been tax resident and tax domiciled in the UK. ""Everything I've ever done when it comes to UK tax affairs has been properly consistent with UK tax... I've never been investigated for my tax affairs,"" he adds. Â© 2025 BBC.

Speaking to Radio 4's Broadcasting House programme earlier this morning, he set out where he stands on a few major areas. On leadership:Shapps insists he'll deliver competent government, telling the BBC he's got the experience. On tax: Tax cuts are a good lever to get money into people's pockets, says Shapps. He would cut the basic rate of tax from 20p to 19p, and would not put corporation tax up. If he's elected, he'll hold an emergency budget. On Partygate:Asked whether he was lied to by the PM about gatherings happening in Downing Street during lockdown, Shapps says no, adding he's run his own department better. He adds that he wasn't able to see his father in hospital during the pandemic. Northern Ireland:Speaking about the current impasse over the Northern Ireland protocol - part of the UK's Brexit deal governing trade arrangments there - Shapps says he believes we're one United Kingdom, but refuses to reveal his negotiating approach on this matter. Trans issues:Shapps is asked whether a Trans woman is a woman. He says one can't deny biology, adding that he has love and respect for those who change their gender. He says his government will not be obsessed with these issues. Rwanda asylum programme:Shapps says he'll keep the programme under which asylum seekers entering the UK illegally are to be sent to Rwanda where they can progress with their applications. He says this country has a big open heart - with many people including himself hosting Ukrainian refugees in their houses. But an open heart doesn't mean allowing people to die in boats in the English Channel, Shapps adds. General election:People expect us to deliver on the vast majority of the 2019 programme, Shapps says. He plans to make the UK the biggest economy in Europe by 2050. More now on Penny Mordaunt, the Minister for Trade since 2021, who has become the ninth person to join the increasingly crowded Tory leadership race. She was first elected as an MP for Portsmouth North in 2010, and was subsequently re-elected to the same seat every year since. She was made Secretary of State for International Development in 2017 and, in May 2019, she became the first woman to hold the post of Secretary of State for Defence - only to be sacked in July, when Boris Johnson became PM. She later re-entered the Government, becoming Paymaster General in 2020. Mordaunt is a staunch Brexiteer and campaigned for Vote Leave in 2016. In a speech last December, she said that Brexit is not ""an act of self-harm or one that requires us to be punished. It is a massive opportunity to anyone who believes in democracy and the power of trade as a force for good in the world."" In the video she shared on social media announcing her leadership bid, Mordaunt says that ""our leadership has to change. It needs to become a little less about the leader and a lot more about the ship"". Moving away from the Conservative leadership contenders briefly now to the opposition, where Labour has been leading calls for a general election and for the prime minister to depart immediately. ""I think it's in the national interest that Boris Johnson goes. I actually think it's really damaging, him clinging on now,"" Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper tells the BBC. ""We need a change from the last 12 years, not the last 12 months."" She says there is still hope that Johnson will ""do the right thing"" and leave Downing Street quickly, but if he clings to power, Labour will push ahead in calling for a no confidence vote in the prime minister next week. ""That (pushing for a vote of no confidence) is what Keir is proposing but we are hoping the Conservatives will address this at their meeting tomorrow,"" she adds. Should asylum seekers be sent toRwanda?""I agree with that policy."" Would youlock downthe country again if there was another pandemic: ""Not for Covid."" Do you keep the commitment to get tonet zeroby 2050: ""Yes."" Will you scrap theBBC licence fee:""No."" Scottish independence:Javid says the last referendum was supposed to be a once in a generation event so he wouldn't allow another for at least a decade. For how many years were younon-domiciled for taxpurposes in the past?  Javid says this was in the 2000s before public life. He adds he had a job that was international and he lived abroad including in the US and Singapore. In 2009 he moved back to the UK and ever since then he's been tax resident and tax domiciled in the UK. ""Everything I've ever done when it comes to UK tax affairs has been properly consistent with UK tax... I've never been investigated for my tax affairs,"" he adds. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Nine candidates have now declared their intention to run to replace Boris Johnson - Penny Mordaunt is the latest to declare Tax is high on the agenda, with Sajid Javid and Jeremy Hunt both saying they will cancel the planned rise in corporation tax and reduce it further Jeremy Hunt denies tax cuts would exacerbate inflation, and says he would appoint Esther McVey as his deputy Sajid Javid denies he was naive to trust Boris Johnson and says he would cut taxes so that people could keep more of their money Former chancellor Rishi Sunak is the bookies' favourite and has suggested tax cuts will have to wait Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi and Transport Secretary Grant Shapps have also joined the race Former equalities minister Kemi Badenoch, Attorney General Suella Braverman and Tom Tugendhat, chair of the Commons foreign affairs committee, are also running Allies of Liz Truss say she will throw her hat in the ring, and Priti Patel is also being touted as a contender Edited by Jeremy Gahagan We're pausing our live coverage for the day now after a busy weekend in the Conservative Party leadership race. Thanks for following along, you can keep up with the latest developmentshere. Today's reporting was brought to you by Jeremy Gahagen, Holly Wallis, Marita Moloney and Jo Couzens. Jeremy Hunt and Sajid Javid both launched their campaign bids on Sunday We'll be ending our live coverage of the leadership contest shortly. Here's a recap of what's happened today: Chris MasonPolitical editor This is the week we found out, barring something totally unforeseen, who will lead the Labour Party into the next general election: Sir Keir Starmer. And we found out who definitely won't be leading the Conservatives into it: Boris Johnson. As the PM's political woes multiplied in recent months, he was, for Labour and others, a political target the size of a barn door. And Starmer sought to define himself as everything Boris Johnson was not. But now, Johnson will soon be the former prime minister, the Labour leader now faces the moving target of a range of possible future ones. And whoever replaces Johnson may not present Starmer with quite the same scope for critique as he's had in recent months. That said, the new Conservative leader won't have a mandate to call their own, and so it will be easier for opponents to question their legitimacy as prime minister. Read more here. Jeremy Hunt is among the candidates doing the rounds on TV and radio today As those entering the running for leader set out their stalls, most of the early pledging has been focused around tax. Many of the declared candidates have already promised to cut taxes on individuals, businesses, or both. Former health secretaries Sajid Javid and Jeremy Hunt have pledged to cut corporation tax - Javid has also promised to bring forward a 1p reduction in income tax to next year. However, Jeremy Hunt tells BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend programme: ""No Conservative should ever promise unfunded tax cuts. It's immoral to load up debt on future generations - my kids, your kids, our grandkids - just for the sake of jam today. ""And so the business tax cuts that I'm proposing are carefully costed. We can do them within the fiscal rules."" But he adds: ""I am passionately in favour of reducing personal taxation. ""But the way you do it is by growing the economy, creating the wealth to make it possible to afford a personal tax cut that will last."" The latest candidate to enter the leadership race, Penny Mordaunt, launched her campaign earlier with a video montage showing the best of Britain. But Paralympian Jonnie Peacock was not best pleased to see a clip of himself sprinting to victory in the 2021 London games in the video, and has requested the footage is removed.

The race is evidently under way - so how will the Tories actually choose a new leader? The timetable for the Conservative leadership race is due to be confirmed on Monday and the new prime minister is expected to be in position by September. People putting themselves forward will first have to secure the backing of Tory MPs before the final two go to a ballot of Conservative members. Under the current rules, candidates need the support of eight Conservative MPs to stand. If there are more than two, Tory MPs hold a series of votes until just two remain. At that point there is a ballot of the wider Conservative Party membership to select the winner. The timescale for each contest is decided by the 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs, and the committee could vote to change the rules before the contest takes place. Attorney General Suella Braverman - the first to throw her hat in the ring for the leadership contest - has been setting out her position on the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). A stauch Brexiteer, Braverman believes the UK ""must fully take back control of our borders"" by ""leaving the jurisdiction of the ECHR"". She says that when people voted for Brexit, they expected this to be done. ""The British people should be able to vote for their priorities and expect that their government can carry them out. This is the definition of taking back control,"" she says. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In recent weeks,the ECHR intervened in a UK court rulingthat would have allowed asylum seekers to be removed to Rwanda - a controversial policy designed to deter smugglers sending people across the English Channel in small boats. ""It is unacceptable"", she says, that ""a foreign court"" was able to stop the first flight to Rwanda. She adds this ""obstruction"" destroys trust in politics. What is the Human Rights Act? This video can not be played Tom Tugendhat has been speaking to BBC News. The tax plans of the leadership contenders once again feature, with Mr Tugendhat pointing out that he hadn't voted in favour of the recent rise in National Insurance. He said the tax rise could inhibit the UK from becoming a ""high-growth"" economy, and he would be ""looking really hard"" at taxes as part of a 10-year economic plan to ensure well-performing public services and a ""strong, more resilient and fairer economy"". Tugendhat also spoke about fuel duty and how the record petrol prices ""had made a difference in my life"". Earlier we reported that Jeremy Hunt has chosen Esther McVey as his deputy prime minister should he win the Tory leadership race. McVey has since written an opinion piece inthe Express,externalin which she says she has not ""sold out"" on her principles by supporting Hunt despite the pair not being ""ideological soulmates"". This ""is not a weakness, it is a strength"", she writes, as ""the Conservative Party is a broad church with a wide base of support and it is essential that we always are"". ""With Jeremy as prime minister, and me serving as his deputy, I believe we can offer the strongest possible appeal to the whole country and to ensure we retain all of our seats at the next General Election with policies and priorities which will resonate in different parts of the country,"" McVey says. She goes on describe what she sees as Hunt's qualities for the top job: work ethic, attention to detail, and an honesty which proves him to be ""a man of impeccable integrity"". Penny Mordaunt is the most recent Tory MP to enter the leadership race Today's Sunday morning was far from easy for those vying for the top job in No 10, with many Tory leadership contenders up and about early outlining why they should be the next prime minister. If you're just joining us, here's a summary of the main developments so far:  You can also read our story on the leadership race here. Therese Coffey says she's proud to be backing her friend Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey says she'd back Foreign Secretary Liz Truss to be the next Tory leader - although Truss hasn't yet declared she's in the running. In a tweet, Coffey says: ""We need a leader who can unite the Red and Blue Wall, has a clear vision for the country and economy, and has the skills and experience to get the tough decisions right. ""Liz's delivery record in government is second to none. She has helped lead the international response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, brokered dozens of post-Brexit trade deals that people thought would be impossible to do. ""Liz is our best chance of winning the next election."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

We know that Boris Johnson has said he will step down as prime minister when a new Conservative Party leader is found. But how will the process unfold? In the past, prime ministers choosing to step down have usually stayed in office until a successor is selected. That means Johnson will stay in position until the Conservatives find a new leader, just as his predecessors Theresa May and David Cameron did when they resigned. It's been suggested that process could last until October, although it could be much shorter - finding May's replacement took two months. In his resignation statement Johnson said: ""I've agreed with Sir Graham Brady, the chairman of our backbench MPs, that the process of choosing that new leader should begin now and the timetable will be announced next week."" Whoever wins the contest to lead the Conservatives will become the leader of the party with the largest number of MPs in Parliament. The Queen will therefore ask them to form a government and they'll become PM. When a prime minister resigns, there is not automatically a general election. The latest an election can be held isJanuary 2025,external, but the new prime minister could choose to call an election before then. Leadership contender Sajid Javid will no doubt be hoping to emulate the viral success of his counterpart Rishi Sunak with his own social media campaign. In the last few minutes, Javid has just resurrected his Team Saj account which lay dormant since July 2019. Also announcing her leadership bid today was Penny Mordaunt - she'll be hoping to gain some traction online with her #pm4pm tag. Allow Twitter content?

Jacob Rees-Mogg says ""gossip"" should not have dictated the fate of Boris Johnson as prime minister following his handling of the Chris Pincher allegations. Calls for Johnson to step down intesified last week after he admitted it wasa ""bad mistake"" to appoint Pincheras deputy chief whip earlier this year, despite being aware of misconduct claims against Pincher during his time at the Foreign Office. Staunch Johnson ally Rees-Mogg tells Sky: ""I believe in the principle that somebody is innocent until proven guilty, and though the reports of what Mr Pincher has done sound very serious, they have gone from sounding as if somebody was too drunk and behaved badly, to a sexual assault, that is a different category. ""And when the prime minister was first talking about it, or his spokesman was first talking about it, it sounded like somebody who was very drunk. But the principle of innocent until proved guilty is fundamental and Mr Pincher is entitled to due process, that's a constitutional fundamental. Dare I say in this current leadership election, there is all sorts of gossip running wild, about all sorts of people, none of which is known. Are we to be a society that whenever there is a little bit of gossip excludes people from their ability to be a member of Parliament?"" Jacob Rees-Mogg Tom Tugendhat, the first of nine Tory MPs to throw their hats in the ring to become their party's next leader, was speaking earlier about his campaign. In an interview with Sky News' Sophy Ridge on Sunday, he emphasised there would be a ""clean start"" for the government under his stewardship. On whether he would consider cutting corporation tax as prime minister, he said plans by his opponents to do so were ""not realistic unless you have ten-year economic plan"". ""You can't simply look at each of these taxes as a one-off, you need to look at it as part of a whole,"" he said. The reality is this economy needs not only lower taxes for growth, but it also needs sound money, and that is why we need to deliver both.""  Tugendhat also warned against the ""real danger"" of ""chasing inflationary spirals"" when asked if public sector workers should get a pay rise. ""I am not going to get into the detail of it until I have set out a ten-year economic plan,"" he said. ""I am afraid it doesn't work to penny-pinch like that or to highlight individual items. ""That is not the way to set out a growing economy, that is not the way to restart the economy, that is not the way to get a clean start."" David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent There are nine
official candidates so far in this leadership election, but one very prominent
issue - taxes. This morning we've heard from
two high-profile candidates - both who used to be health secretary. Jeremy Hunt and Sajid Javid. Hunt confirmed a prominent Brexiteer, Esther McVey, would be his deputy prime minister. That's perhaps an attempt to distance himself from his Remain-voting
past. He's promised tax
cuts under his premiership. He's specifically focusing on lowering costs for
business, and argues these sort of changes won't fuel inflation. His rival, Sajid
Javid, is promising Â£39bn of tax cuts, many of them aimed at allowing people to
keep more of their money. He argues it's actually a risk to not do this. He's even changed
his mind on a tax rise introduced in April to help the NHS - the very health
service he was running at the time. They're not alone
in these pledges, most candidates are promising similar. Remember, they're
pitching themselves to Tory members, many who will feel the tax burden is
currently too high. Transport Secretary Grant Shappshas been doing his first media interviews since deciding to run for PM.
