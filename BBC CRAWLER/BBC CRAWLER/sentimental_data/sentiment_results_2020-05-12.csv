"Rihanna is now the richest woman in music Rihanna has made her debut appearance on The Sunday Times Rich List, with an estimated fortune of Â£468 million. The Bajan pop star, who now resides in London, overtakes Sirs Elton John and Mick Jagger to claim third place on the list of Britain's richest musicians. Andrew Lloyd Webber and Paul McCartney are joint firston the list,external, with fortunes of Â£800m apiece. Rihanna's earnings are largely due to the Fenty Beauty cosmetics brand, where her reported 15% stake is worth Â£351m. ""She somewhat caught us by surprise,"" says Robert Watts, who compiles The Sunday Times' annual list. ""Very few people knew she was living in the UK until last summer. Now she's well placed to be the first musician to reach billionaire status in the UK,"" he tells the BBC. Rihanna, who turned 32 in February, is a youthful exception amongst Britain's richest musicians, most of whom found fame in the 1960s and 70s. Amongst the top 40 highest-earners, only Ed Sheeran and Adele are younger, with fortunes of Â£200m and Â£150m respectively. Further down the list, there are new entries for the next generation of pop stars, with Dua Lipa, 24, and George Ezra, 26, each said to be worth Â£16m. Theatre impresario Lord Lloyd-Webber, 72, is the only star on the list to see his valuation fall, with Watts calculating that the Covid-19 shutdown of theatres in the West End and Broadway has already wiped Â£20m off his fortune. Sir Paul, by contrast, receives a Â£50m boost to his finances, thanks to a lucrative world tour and his first children's book Hey Grandude!, which topped the New York Times' best-seller list last year. Sir Elton's farewell tour also added Â£40m to his fortune, putting him in fourth place; while Rolling Stone Sir Mick comes fifth with Â£285m. Ed Sheeran topped the young musicians (aged 30 or under) list, adding Â£40m to his overall wealth after completing a 255-date world tour last August. Harry Styles took second place, with a fortune of Â£63m. All five members of One Direction appear on the list, with Harry Styles just above his bandmate Niall Horan Eagle-eyed readers might spot that U2 have dropped off the Sunday Times' rankings entirely, despite taking third place last year with earnings of Â£583m. Their absence is solely due to coronavirus - as the pandemic has delayed the publication of the paper's Irish Rich List. When those figures are revealed later this year, the band is likely to knock Rihanna down to fourth place. Nonetheless, Watts says that Rihanna's presence is indicative of a ""seismic change"" in the make-up of the main Rich List which, since 1989, had been identifying the 1,000 wealthiest individuals or families living in the UK. ""The days when it was dominated by inherited wealth, the landed gentry and mass of largely white, middle-aged and elderly men, are changing,"" says Watts. ""For example, we've seen a big rise in the number of Asian entrepreneurs and in the number of self-made people. ""Rihanna is, I think, a very good example of someone who's come from a pretty tough upbringing in Barbados and who has a hunger and a determination to work, work work... which, I think, is one of her songs, isn't it?"" (It is,external). Rihanna's earnings from beauty and fashion eclipse those from her music career Although Rihanna made her name in music, she hasn't released an album since 2016's Anti, instead concentrating on her fashion empire. Fenty Beauty launched in September 2017, and was designed to cater to a wider range of skin types and tones than typical cosmetic brands. Thanks to the star's endorsement, and her 82 million Instagram followers, it was an immediate success, racking up sales of Â£78m in its first few weeks. The company is now valued at $3bn (Â£2.4bn). Rihanna also has a lingerie line, Savage X Fenty, and continues to receive royalties from hit songs like SOS, Umbrella and Only Girl In The World. Her Â£468m fortune makes her the richest female musician not just in the UK, but the world - ahead of Madonna (Â£462m), Celine Dion (Â£365m) and BeyoncÃ© (Â£325m). Watts notes that musicians' wealth ""held up better than many other ultra-high net worth individuals"" over the last 12 months, but says the impact of cancelled tours could impact next year's list. ""Their fortunes have held up a little better this year because they're coming off the back of big tours and their valuation is not affected by a plunging stock market,"" he says. ""But next year I would expect, for a lot of these musicians, their wealth to flatline - and some of them may even have to dip into their reserves.""

"MyTechDomestic listed hard-to-find gadgets at discounted prices A suspected scam store, featuring hard-to-find gadgets priced below the norm, topped Google search results for days. MyTechDomestic accepted payments via direct bank transfers only - despite indicating support for credit cards and PayPal - and falsely claimed to be owned by a UK-registered company. It was flagged to Google last week but the US company took action only after being contacted by BBC News on Monday. The site's operator did not respond to several requests for comment. However, the platform went offline shortly after BBC News asked for a response to customers' claims it amounted to a ""scam"". Action Fraud - the UK's national reporting centre for fraud and cyber-crime - is looking into the matter after receiving a complaint from a member of the public. ""Given the large numbers of people who view these adverts, Google should move much more quickly in response to reports of scams, and be proactive about vetting them to help prevent people losing money to fraudsters,"" Which? Computing editor Kate Bevan said. MyTechDomestic's website was registered with a Canadian domain registrar on 19 April. It was subsequently promoted via ads bought from Google's Shopping service, meaning its listings featured a ""By Google"" tag when they appeared within its search results. By late last week, the site was top billed for several gadgets sold out or priced at a premium elsewhere. These ads appeared at the top of Google's mobile search results and to the side of some desktop searches. The products included: the Oculus Quest virtual-reality headset, 64GB edition the Fortnite edition of the Sony PlayStation 4 Reebok's GX40S cross-trainer The company's ads appeared at the top of search results on mobile phones The store often indicated it had relatively low supplies left in stock and frequently priced products at an 18% discount. And although its pages featured logos for American Express, Mastercard and PayPal, at point-of-sale it allowed customers to pay via a bank transfer only. Initially, it listed a Paris-based account. But after one user drew attention to this beingunusual, on a post to MoneySavingExpert.com's forum,,externalthe site switched to using an English bank. MyTechDomestic stated it was operated by a London-based corporation, for which it provided an address and registration number. But that company turned out to be a seven-year-old business consultancy with similar initials, which denied involvement. ""MyTechDomestic is nothing whatsoever to do with MTDO Ltd,"" a spokesman said. ""We don't sell anything on the internet and we were shocked that it was that easy to set up something that steals someone else's company's identity."" MTDO said it had reported the issue to Google on Friday, 8 May, via its Report Phishing tool. However, the adverts remained online until Monday evening. The site often indicated its stock levels were low, in the individual product listings After being contacted by BBC News, Google began its own investigation. It concluded the site had violated its ""misrepresentation policy"" and should have been dealt with more quickly. ""We take dishonest business practices very seriously and consider them to be an egregious violation of our policies,"" a spokeswoman said. ""We have a tool where anyone can report these ads and these complaints are reviewed manually by our team. ""In 2019, we removed 2.7 billion bad ads and we're constantly updating our policies as we see new threats emerge."" The site's registrar, PlanetHoster, confirmed it had also taken action of its own. ""Currently, the website mytechdomestic.com is suspended for a violation of our policy,"" it said in a statement. ""Unfortunately, we cannot share more information about this case without an official warrant."" Meanwhile, several of the site's users voiced concerns they may have been""scammed"" out of hundreds of pounds, in complaints posted to TrustPilot's,externalreview site. ""[An] investigation is currently ongoing with my bank and the Action Fraud police,"" one, who had paid Â£311.59 for a treadmill, told BBC News. One cyber-security expert said consumers should be ""wary"" of listings from unfamiliar names - even if they were promoted by Google. ""Having been warned of a suspicious site, Google could easily have confirmed that the site was less than a month old and asking for payment in a way which doesn't protect consumers,"" Graham Cluley said. ""At the very least, it should have suspended the shopping lists while it investigated the domain.""

"This video can not be played Nineteen babies are being cared for at the Ataturk Children's Hospital The number of people who were killed in a militant attack on a maternity ward in the Afghan capital has risen to 24. Mothers, newborn babies and nurses were among the victims. At least 16 people were injured, the health ministry said. Tuesday's attack in Kabul prompted widespread condemnation. No group has said it carried it out. In a second incident that day, a suicide bomber killed at least 32 people at a funeral in Nangarhar, in the east of the country. US-Taliban deal raises hope for peace The Afghan war: The short and long story A month of killing in Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani has ordered the resumption of offensive operations against the Taliban and other groups. He accused the militants of ignoring repeated calls for a reduction in violence. Warning: Some readers may find details in this story upsetting The Islamic State (IS) group said it was behind the attack on the police commander's funeral in Nangarhar. It is still not clear who carried out the attack at the Dasht-e-Barchi hospital in Kabul, and the Taliban have denied any involvement. Allow Twitter content?

Nineteen babies have been taken to safety in a children's hospital in the city but many of their mothers are feared to be dead. In all,about 100 people were killed in violence around Afghanistan on Tuesday,external, the New York Times said. The attacks underline the fragility of peace efforts, and have dimmed hopes for an end to decades of war. Locals describe hearing two blasts then gunfire at the start of the attack at about 10:00 (05:30 GMT) on Tuesday. About 140 people were in the hospital at the time, one doctor who escaped told the BBC. The maternity ward in the hospital is run by the international medical charity MÃ©decins sans FrontiÃ¨res (MSF) and some of those working there were foreigners. The hospital was attacked on Tuesday morning ""Total panic"" took hold as the assault unfolded, another doctor told AFP news agency. Ramazan Ali, a vendor who saw the attack begin, told Reuters news agency: ""The attackers were shooting at anyone in this hospital without any reason."" One mother gave birth during the attack, MSF was quoted as saying by AFP news agency. Another woman called Zainab had given birth just before the attack, Reuters reports. She named her baby boy Omid, which means ""hope"" in Dari, because it had taken her years to conceive. Alerted by the commotion as she was visiting the washroom, the new mother rushed back to find her child of four hours, her hope of seven years, dead. ""I brought my daughter-in-law to Kabul so that she would not lose her baby,"" said Zahra Muhammadi, Zainab's mother-in-law, in her grief. ""Today we'll take his dead body to Bamiyan."" Afghan special forces rescued 100 women and children, including three foreigners, an official told the BBC. The three attackers, who reportedly had gained access dressed as police officers, were all killed by security personnel. Images from the scene showed soldiers carrying newborn babies swaddled in blood-stained blankets to safety. In the past, similar attacks in this mostly Shia Muslim area of the capital have been attributed to IS which, like the Taliban, is Sunni Muslim. The IS leader in South Asia and the Far East was arrestedin Kabul on Monday along with two other high-profile members, Afghan intelligence said. As well as two babies, at least 12 mothers and healthcare workers were killed In 2017, IS gunmen disguised as medical staffattacked Kabul's main military hospital, prompting widespread shock and anger and raising questions about security. The authorities later confirmed about 50 people had been killed. But the Taliban also attack hospitals. Last September, 20 people died after a truck packed with explosives was detonated by militants from the group outside a hospital in southern Zabul province. On TV, Mr Ghani said: ""In order to provide security for public places and to thwart attacks and threats from the Taliban and other terrorist groups, I'm ordering Afghan security forces to switch from an active defence mode to an offensive one and to resume their operations against the enemies."" Even in a country which has seen the worst of the worst, this savage attack on newborn babies and their mothers has shocked, and shaken fragile hope this would be the year Afghanistan would finally start to turn towards peace. Images of special forces in bulky body armour, carrying infants to safety, will remain long in the memory of those who have repeatedly called for a ceasefire - especially when Afghans are battling another deadly enemy in Covid-19. Despite Taliban denials that this ghastly attack was their work, President Ghani's denunciation reflects the anger and frustration of many. Some worry that groups like Islamic State, trying to drive an even greater wedge between Taliban and the government, have also killed for now what were slow uncertain steps toward peace talks. And for those who have never trusted the Taliban's commitment, this latest attack solidifies their resolve to keep fighting. Tuesday's attacks were widely condemned by countries around the world and human rights groups, with Amnesty International saying: ""The unconscionable war crimes in Afghanistan today... must awaken the world to the horrors civilians continue to face."" Relatives were still looking for news of their loved ones on Wednesday, a day after the attack ""Who attacks newborn babies and new mothers? Who does this?"" tweeted Debra Lyons, the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said: ""Any attack on innocents is unforgiveable, but to attack infants and women in labour... is an act of sheer evil. ""Terrorists who attack mourners lining up for prayer at a funeral are only seeking to tear apart the bonds that hold families and communities together, but they will never succeed."" According to survivors, thousands of people had gathered for the funeral in Nangarhar, and the bomb detonated about half-way through. Casualty figures have been rising since first reports of the bombing. Officials now say 133 people were injured. People help those injured during the attack on the funeral to a hospital Meanwhile, in northern Balkh province, at least 10 people were killed and many others injured in an air strike by US forces, reports said. Residents and the Taliban claimed the victims were all civilians, but the Afghan Defence Ministry said all those killed were militants. Since a February troop withdrawal agreement signed between the US and the Taliban, talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban have broken down over a prisoner swap and violence has continued unabated. The agreement was aimed at ending more than 18 years of war since US-led forces ousted the Taliban from power following the 9/11 attacks on the US, whose mastermind Osama Bin Laden had been given sanctuary by the hardline Islamist group. Tens of thousands of people, most of them civilians, have been killed in the conflict. Many more have been injured or displaced from their homes.

"Perranporth Golf Club, in Cornwall, will be one of many courses to reopen on Wednesday - although people will not be able to play fourballs Phones have been ringing off the hook, venue bosses are working harder than ever and search engines are being sent into overdrive after some recreational sports were given the go-ahead to return in England. Golf, tennis, angling and basketball are among the sports taking tentative steps in allowing the general public to return to participation on Wednesday as coronavirus lockdown measures are eased. But each sport is also urging caution and vigilance as they seek to keep the spread of the virus under control while also helping protect people's mental health and wellbeing. So how has the first wave of the nation's sports begun to come out of hibernation after two months? BBC Sport has spoken to a number of clubs and organisations hoping to use fun and games as a vehicle for helping the country come gradually out of lockdown. Courses across England will once again be alive with the sound of golf balls being hit on Wednesday. Governing bodies have worked together to formulate how the game can be played safely during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. There is plenty of guidance on how to socially distance, new rules on course etiquette and phrases such as ""wash your hands, don't touch the flag"" which have now entered the golfing lexicon. Golf is back - but what are the differences? David Rickman, the R&A's executive director of governance, said everyone in the sport is ""conscious of the continued impact of the pandemic and that lives are still being lost"", but added that golf has a ""small part to play"" in the nation's wellbeing. ""We are fortunate that golf lends itself to social distancing, so by making a few relatively small changes to the rules and the environment in which we play, we can make it safe for golfers,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live. Already Perranporth Golf Course, in Cornwall, is fully booked for when play can resume on Wednesday. All tee times for the first day of play in more than seven weeks were snapped up in less than 24 hours after prime minister Boris Johnson announced that golfers could get back on the greens. Sue McDevitt, general manager of the course, said the ""booking system went crazy"" after the announcement. ""I had one of the busiest days of my working career on Monday,"" McDevitt told BBC Sport. Members will be able to play either the front or back nine at Perranporth Golf Club to double capacity on the course The booking of tee times, which was previously advisable at the club, has now become compulsory during the pandemic in an effort to help keep golfers safe and numbers on the course in check. While it is largely done online, McDevitt says she is also taking bookings from older members who simply don't have access to technology. It has been a busy two days getting ready to once again host golf at Perranporth, but with seven weeks of preparation the challenge has been met ""with ease"" considering the circumstances. ""We always knew it was going to come back at some point, so I've been really busy during these last few weeks coming up with a plan on how we are going to do it, "" McDevitt said. ""I even emailed what the plan was to the members so they would be ready."" Just hours after the government announced that recreational golf would be free to restart, the club published a nine-point notice on their social media channels outlining their approach. It is a basic roadmap back to the greens that was drawn up with the help of the major golfing bodies in England and in conjunction with neighbouring clubs, West Cornwall, Tehidy Park, Mullion and Newquay. ""We already had close working relationships so we decided between us that we would have similar plans so golfers in the area would all have similar options,"" McDevitt said. ""It is in all our interests to get as much golf going in Cornwall as possible."" As far as business goes, much of the club remains unable to open during the pandemic, with the course's accommodation, restaurant, bar, golf shop and practice facilities all shut. A majority of staff, including some green keepers, remain furloughed, which makes aspects of opening - including maintaining the course and keeping tabs on golfers - a challenge. ""The course is open and it looks absolutely beautiful, but it is perhaps not going to play as well as it normally would at this time of year because it hasn't had all those man hours manicuring it,"" McDevitt said. ""It is playable but the members may lose their ball in the rough initially. They are quite happy with that because they can play golf. It doesn't need to be at Championship standard yet, but we will get there."" Fishing is one of the sports that people can start to resume doing on Wednesday Angling has found itself thrust into the limelight since the gradual easing of lockdown restrictions was announced, with both fresh and saltwater recreational fishing being allowed to resume across England. But why has it been identified among the sports and pastimes deemed appropriate and suitable? According to Martin Salter, head of policy at the Angling Trust, it's the result of producing a detailed plan to demonstrate why angling is a Covid-19 compliant sport due to its general nature, and earning recognition from the government that it ""has potential to be part of the solution and not part of the problem"". ""Spending time outdoors and in fresh air can limit the spread of the virus rather than the other way round,"" Salter told BBC Sport. ""We can help disperse crowds and have a positive effect on people's mental health and wellbeing. ""But it really is incumbent on all of us to realise we're going to be ambassadors for our sport. The spotlight is going to be on us. ""The last thing I want to see is pictures in newspapers and other media outlets of anglers crowding around piers or breakwaters too close to each other. ""We must continue to respect the social distancing guidelines and ensure, when we say to both government and society that angling is a Covid-19 compliant sport, we demonstrate that responsibility to ourselves and each other."" The Angling Trust is also continuing to lobby government for clarity over when and how tackle and bait shops can reopen to support the angling infrastructure, in a similar way to  cycle shops being allowed to continue trading during lockdown. ""Those shops are where you pick up your permits, your licences, your day tickets, where you get your advice as anglers,"" he said. ""A lot of those retailers have been struggling so we've made direct representations to government and we hope they can grant an extension to allow those shops to reopen before June."" While recreational angling is free to resume from Wednesday, match fishing and competitions remain banned for the foreseeable future in line with other major sporting events and mass gatherings. The coarse fishing close season for rivers and some still waters also remains in place until 16 June. Some commercial fisheries across England will actually remain closed as they choose to ""wait and see"" how the sport's approach to coming out of lockdown unfolds. One that will be welcoming anglers back is Makins Fishery, near Nuneaton, in Warwickshire, but under a series of rules and guidelines, including only allowing pre-booked visits and operating strict daytime opening hours. Wendell Ward, manager of the three-lake facility, has had three phones ringing off the hook since Sunday evening, but stresses anglers will need to be responsible. ""We have to ensure people can return to fishing in a safe environment,"" he said. ""Initially I did think it might be a bit too soon to reopen and I would've been happy to wait a bit longer. But if we put the right measures in place and control numbers, people can get back to enjoying the sport. ""I know people have been chomping at the bit to get back out there since lockdown, but I don't want them being careless and reckless. ""Restrictions have been relaxed and reopening is vital for our business, but if people turn up in big groups and car loads, they will be sent away and we'll have to reconsider our choice."" Many tennis courts across England will reopen on Wednesday for the first time since being closed on 23 March because of the coronavirus pandemic With people in England allowed to exercise outside as many times as they wish, a variety of facilities can now be accessed. Although playgrounds, outdoor gyms and ticketed outdoor leisure venues will remain closed, playing one-on-one sports, including tennis, basketball and even a hit in the cricket nets, is permissible as long as social distancing rules are observed. Sunday's government announcement saw searches for venues ""go bonkers"" for Playfinder, an online booking portal for grassroots facilities. Where? How? Who with? Getting yourself back into playing tennis Jamie Foale, the founder and chief executive of the company which has 5,200 venues on its books across the UK, said Monday was the marketplace's busiest day since lockdown began. A new filter is poised to be added to their search options, distinguishing what venues are open to the public as not every court, course or venue is suitable or able to host people yet. ""As a result of the clarification given on Monday we are seeing almost all councils open their suitable venues to a degree,"" said Foale, whose company manages bookings for a number of councils, as well as schools and commercial sites. ""Councils recognise they a have a big part to play in helping people stay fit and healthy through this and I know that they want to be able to open facilities so they can do that. ""We had a number of bookings made on Monday and a lot of searches for free courts, which has always been a big part of what we do."" Foale said the most difficult part of helping people prepare for the resumption of recreational sports has been getting in touch with the venues themselves when huge swathes of employees in the sector have been furloughed. ""We've madly been calling up the venues to make sure we have a firm grip on what is available and what isn't,"" said Foale, whose company will not be taking booking fees during the pandemic. ""Communication has been hard when all these businesses are struggling, trying to work out how they will operate in a post-pandemic world. ""We need to keep the nation moving and active. We, as a business, set up to to help people play sport. And that service is now needed more than ever."" A sign of the times that many may end up seeing on their local court or around their favourite course will be signage reminding participants of the rules which have made a return to action possible. Governing bodies for each sport have different directives to best suit the game being played. All of them, however, have the same underlying message about maintaining social distance. Not every sporting venue will automatically open as a result, with this being a key message from the Lawn Tennis Association, which governs the game in Britain. Venues have been advised to take time to ensure they are set up to reopen safely, so players in certain places might have to wait a little longer before they can get back on court. The Queen's Club in London, one of the nation's most iconic clubs, for example, will not be at full capacity as they have chosen to open only nine of its 27 outdoor courts to members from Wednesday. It is a similar situation at the Northern Tennis Club, in Manchester, where only seven of their 18 outdoor courts will be opened to ensure social distancing is maintained. ""We're hugely relieved and excited that we're able to start reopening the courts, but we're also conscious that we must do it slowly and cautiously,"" chairman Neville Hewer told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""We've been maintaining our courts during the lockdown period so we were in a position to go when we had the opportunity to, but we're mindful of the fact that in this circumstance we're walking on eggshells because of this unprecedented scenario.""

"The first step includes changes to rules on exercise and allowing churches to open for private prayer A five-stage plan for easing the Covid-19 lockdown in Northern Ireland has been published by the executive. Unlike plans announced inEngland,externaland theRepublic of Ireland, NI's blueprint does not include a timetable - but the first minister said she hoped to reach the final stage by December. Progression will depend on key health criteria being met, Arlene Foster said. The first step includes changes to rules on exercise and churches being able to open for private prayer. It comes as a further nine deaths were recorded by the Department of Health on Tuesday, although only one had occurred within the past 24 hours. The document, entitledExecutive Approach to Decision-Making,external, was outlined by Mrs Foster and Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill in the Stormont Assembly. In the first stage, groups of four to six people who do not share a household would be allowed to meet outdoors while maintaining social distancing. Large outdoor-based retailers such as garden centres will also be allowed to reopen in this first phase, as life slowly edges its way back towards normality. However, the plan stresses that aspects of some steps may not take effect at the same time. Movement between stages of the Pathway to Recovery would depend on progress in reducing the transmission of the virus, said Mrs Foster. ""We will not be driven by a timetable and we know some will be disappointed by that - but our roadmap doesn't answer every query, it provides people with an indication of how things might move in the weeks and months ahead."" Ms O'Neill appealed to the public to ""be patient"". ""When we're in position to slowly and carefully move out of the lockdown, we will keep you updated every step of the way,"" she added. ""It's not in the too-distant future, if people keep following the advice."" Some business leaders in Northern Ireland have expressed disappointment that indicative timings have not been included in the plan, with Chief Executive of the Belfast Chamber of Commerce, Simon Hamilton, sayinga timetable was needed in order for firms to plan,externalproperly. But Mrs Foster said the ""sad truth"" was that some businesses in Northern Ireland would not survive. ""It's right we're honest about that,"" she told the assembly. ""What we have to do is to try and make sure the maximum number of businesses survive and that has always been what has driven the executive in terms of their economic interventions, put alongside Westminster government interventions."" Chancellor Rishi Sunak has announced that the UK scheme to pay workers on leave because of the lockdownwill be extended to October. While a path out of the lockdown has been laid out, the 'Stay at Home' message remains in place Northern Ireland has its own powers to set and lift restrictions at different rates to the rest of the UK. The executive must review its coronavirus regulations every three weeks, with the next due by 28 May. In some reviews, no changes may be recommended, but a flexible approach will mean each review stage does not have to be tied to the next step of relaxations. The plan says the executive will only relax restrictions in line with the long-term interest of people's health and wellbeing. Step one: Encouragement to those unable to work from home to return to work on a phased basis Large outdoor-based retail can open including garden centres, though associated cafes and restaurants can only offer takeaway or collection Groups of four to six people who do not share a household can meet outdoors maintaining social distancing. With the exception of people who are shielding, visits to immediate family allowed indoors where social distancing is possible Drive-through church services and churches open for private prayer, with appropriate social distancing and cleaning of shared contact hard surfaces Outdoor spaces and public sport amenities to open. For example, walking, running, cycling, some water activities, golf, tennis Drive-through cinemas can open Step two: Non-food retail can open where numbers are limited, with social distancing Groups of up to 10 can meet outdoors As demand increases on public transport within social distancing requirements, people encouraged to walk and cycle for short journeys where possible Resumption of, for example, team sports training on a non-contact basis in small groups Selected libraries reopen with restricted services Open-air museums reopen Step three: Phased return to office and onsite working subject to risk assessment. Work that can be done from home should still be done from home Schools expand provision for priority groups on a part-time basis, using a combination of in-school and remote learning Gatherings can accommodate up to 30 people while maintaining social distancing Resumption of, for example, team sports training on a non-contact basis Museums and galleries open Libraries open Concert and theatre rehearsals resume Step four: Other ""contact"" retail (hairdressers, fitness studios, tattoo and piercing parlours) can open subject to mitigations following risk assessment Schools expand provision to accommodate all pupils on part-time basis with combination of in-school and remote learning Reducing and staggering demand for public transport at peak times through continued home working and staggered start times for businesses Wider range of gatherings permitted including church services subject to social distancing and other suitable mitigations, such as cleaning of hard surfaces Resumption of competitive sport ""behind closed doors"" or with limitations on the number of spectators Leisure centres and other indoor leisure facilities open Outdoor concerts on restricted basis Step five: All able to return to work subject to mitigations. Remote working still strongly encouraged Hospitality retail (restaurants, cafes, pubs) can open subject to risk assessment, initially on a limited basis Expand early-year school provision to full-time basis Public transport operating full service but subject to ongoing risk assessment People can meet in extended groups subject to social distancing Resumption of close physical contact sports Return to competitive sport and full use of sporting facilities Spectators can attend live events on restricted basis Nightclubs, concerts open on a limited basis Read the full document,external How do lockdown rules differ in Northern Ireland? The focus on a recovery plan comes as 447 Covid-19 related deaths,mostly comprising hospital fatalities, have been reported by Northern Ireland's Department of Health so far. However, that figure is likely to be higher when all fatalities in the community are recorded. A further nine deaths were recorded by the department on Tuesday, only one had occurred within the past 24 hours. There have been 4,193 positive cases of the virus in NI, with 44 new cases confirmed by Tuesday. Across the UK, the death toll currently stands at 32,692 while in the Republic of Ireland, 1,488 people have died. As the infection has spread at different rates in various parts of the UK, Stormont ministers have said Northern Ireland must follow its own criteria and scientific advice. The R-value - or reproduction number- is at the heart of the executive's decision to extend the lockdown until at least the end of May. R refers to the average number of people that someone with Covid-19 is expected to infect after contracting the virus. The goal is to keep R under one. On Tuesday Arlene Foster told the executive's daily press conference that Northern Ireland's R-rate is sitting below one, at 0.79, but that it must fall as low as possible before restrictions can begin to be lifted. If the number drops to a suitable level before the restrictions are next due to be reviewed, ministers hope to trigger the first step of the plan sooner, added Michelle O'Neill. The executive will assess the figure on a ""daily"" basis, but a wider programme of testing and tracing will accompany any decisions around easing restrictions. Contact tracing aims to identify and alert people who have come into contact with a person infected with coronavirus. It largely stopped in the UK on 12 March, as the government moved into a different stage of its response to the virus, but apilot programme recommenced in NIlast month. Mrs Foster said this was now set to be extended from 18 May. The benefit of this approach is that the Executive will not tie itself down or have to engage in any difficult retreats in previously stated policies. Stormont ministers point to other countries around the world which have appeared to make great progress in curbing the virus, but have more recently experienced flare ups and had to re-impose controls. However, maximum flexibility for Stormont equals maximum uncertainty for wider society. Maybe that's just the reality in these challenging times. In future weeks ,we shall all be trying to become increasingly well versed with the R-number, which measures the spread of the virus. But ministers will know that their five-step approach will also be judged alongside the different five-point plans already laid out by Dublin and London, which will influence the context in which people comply with the coronavirus regulations in the months ahead.

"Hormone-fed beef and chlorine-washed chicken should remain banned in England after Brexit, the government has been warned. Ministers say the issue will be dealt with in the upcoming Trade Bill. But opponents of these practices say that could lead to farm standards being bargained away in negotiations. Instead, they want ministers to guarantee food standards in the Agriculture Bill, which returns to the House of Commons on Wednesday. Some Conservative MPs have joined up with the opposition to demand protection for England's farmers from lower standard produce from countries like the US. Farmers there are allowed to feed beef with hormones and wash chickens with chlorine solution in order to maximise productivity. But both of these practices are currently banned in the EU. The US demands that ban should be lifted. A government spokesperson said existing protections would not be compromised in trade negotiations. How safe is chlorine-washed chicken? UK's chlorine-washed chicken ban 'to remain' US firms seek changes to UK beef standards US urges UK to embrace chlorinated chicken The issue is part of a great upheaval in UK farm and countryside policy â the biggest since World War II. The UK government wants to shift farm grants to reward activities that enhance the environment. Its opponents are concerned at the lack of clarity over exactly how the transformation will happen, and want the changes to be delayed. Minsters are likely to suffer huge pressure in the Commons on the question of food import standards. They face almost identical amendments to the Bill from some Conservative back-benchers; the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Efra) Select Committee; and the Labour and Liberal Democrat front benches. They are all calling for a level playing field on food standards. Jyoti Fernandes, from the Landworkers' Alliance, a union of farmers and other land-based workers, said: ""The Agriculture Bill is a historic moment to make or break our food system. There are concerns imports won't meet existing farm standards âIf we donât protect our farms from being undercut by cheap imports and make a firm commitment to supporting our farmers through this transition, we can wave goodbye to a humane and ecological domestic food supply for future generations."" Sally-Ann Spence, from the Nature Friendly Farming Network, runs a farm in Wiltshire. She said: âAs a farmer doing my best to protect our precious natural environment and heritage, the prospect of low-standard imports fills me with dread. âIn the UK, we are striving to deliver healthy food at world-leading standards whilst managing the land for wildlife and public goods. âI urge MPs to safeguard our high environmental and animal welfare standards in trade law.â With its huge majority, the government is not thought to be in danger of losing key votes. But Neil Parish, Conservative chair of the Efra committee, said: âWe (Tories) put high welfare standards in our manifesto so people will be expecting us to deliver on that. âThe government mustnât allow any trade deal with the US, or anyone else, to undermine British food standards.â A government spokesperson said: ""The UK is renowned for its high environmental, food safety and animal welfare standards. ""We have been clear that in all of our trade negotiations we will not compromise on our high environmental protection, animal welfare and food standards."" Agricultural policies in the UK are devolved.

Meanwhile, the property markets in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland remain shut. Home viewings are not permitted under lockdown regulations, and their land registries are either running a reduced service or are not registering transactions. The updated regulations, presented to Parliament by Health Secretary Matt Hancock, also allow people in England to leave their homes to collect goods ordered from businesses and travel to waste or recycling centres.

"This video can not be played Matt Hancock: ""Unlikely that big, lavish international holidays are going to possible for this summer"" Many British people are unlikely to be able to take foreign holidays this summer because of coronavirus, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said. He told ITV's This Morning it's ""likely to be the case"" there won't be a normal summer holiday season. The government is opening up parts of the economy, and Ryanair is planning to start services in July. But Mr Hancock said the traditional big-break holiday season is unlikely. Social distancing will have to be maintained for some time, he said. ""The conclusion from that is it is unlikely that big, lavish international holidays are going to be possible for this summer."" What are the new travel quarantine rules? How will transport need to change? Mr Hancock's comments came as many airlines detailed plans to restart flights. Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary, who last month said that leaving the middle seat free to help social distancing was ""idiotic"", said he planned to sell as many seats as possible this summer. The airline is planning to operate nearly 1,000 flights a day from July, up from 30 today. It said face coverings being worn by all crew and passengers and cashless on-board transactions would help keep passengers safe as well as a new system for toilet breaks. Passengers will haveto ask crew to use the toiletto stop queues forming. Meanwhile, EasyJet has told the BBC that it does not have a date for restarting flights, but is keeping the situation under review. The announcement came despite government plans to introducea 14-day quarantine for international travellersto prevent a second spike in the virus, infuriating airlines which planned to resume flying in the coming months. Willie Walsh, boss of rival firm IAG, which owns British Airways, criticised the move, warning it would force him to review his plans to ramp up flights in the summer. ""There's nothing positive in anything I heard the prime minister say [on Sunday],"" he told MPs. Virgin Atlantic also released its summer schedule for 2021 on Tuesday, promising more flights to Tel Aviv as well as routes linking Florida with Manchester, Glasgow, London Heathrow and Belfast after it pulled out of Gatwick. Scenes that are unlikely to be seen this summer John and Irene Hays, owners of travel company Hays Travel,which took over Thomas Cook's shops last year, said the news has not dampened people's enthusiasm to get away. Mr Hay told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""There is a real desire to go on holiday. People have been locked down, and in terms of new bookings we're getting strong demand."" Talking about trips which were booked earlier in the year, Mrs Hays added: ""Many people are not cancelling, they are just deferring their holiday or in some cases holding on to a credit note for now."" Mr Hays also thought that having to self-isolate at home for 14 days after returning from abroad may not stop people travelling. ""If people in the UK are already in lockdown, they might be happy to spend another fortnight at home. Some people might say go to Spain or somewhere, have a nice holiday and then come back and continue their lockdown,"" he said. Mr Hancock's comments echo those from Transport Secretary Grant Shapps last month who warned people not to book summer holidays - domestic and overseas - until social distancing rules are relaxed. ""I won't be booking a summer holiday at this point,"" he told the BBC on 17 April. Airlines, and the travel industry generally, have been among the biggest financial losers of the international lockdown. Aircraft fleets have been grounded and thousands of job cuts announced, withBritish Airways shedding 12,000  jobsandVirgin 3,000 jobs. LOCKDOWN UPDATE:What's changing, where?

People across India watched PM Modi's address to the nation Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has announced a 20tn-rupee (Â£216bn; $266bn) support package for the country's economy to help mitigate the damage caused by
the coronavirus outbreak. In a televised address to the nation, Modi said the crisis was also an opportunity for India to become self-reliant. Details of the package - equivalent to about 10% of India's GDP - are expected to be unveiled shortly.

Fifteen of the holes at Llanymynech Golf Club, near Oswestry, are completely in Wales - where golf clubs are not allowed to reopen yet. Two of the holes are across the border in Shropshire, while the fourth hole is split across Wales and England. The club has expressed its disappointment at ""conflicting guidelines that hinder practical compliance"" for people who live in border areas. Wales' former world number one Ian Woosnam learned to play golf at Llanymynech Golf Club NYPD officers arrest a man on 2 May for spitting at people on the street The district attorneys (DAs) of every New York City borough - except Staten Island - have said they won't prosecute arrests for violating social distancing orders, in place to contain the spread of coronavirus. The DAs of Manhattan, the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens announced their policies after the city produced New York police arrest data that showed most social distancing suspects were ethnic minorities. The head of the city's largest police union called on Mayor Bill de Blasio to ""get cops out of the social distancing enforcement business altogether"". ""My membership demands to know the rationale behind being ordered to make arrests - and risking injury to themselves and citizens - when those arrests not result in criminal prosecution,"" the letter states. Across the US, police have been criticised for seeming to take a heavy hand with racial minorities, while going easy on white people accused of similar social distancing violations. Fewer than 100 organ transplants were carried out in the UK last month, the lowest number for 36 years, causing concerns that waiting times for patients could increase. NHS Blood and Transplant analysis showed there were 99 operations in April, down from 244 in March. The last time the monthly total dropped below 100 was February 1984. Some specialists fear the fall in the number of operations will cause a backlog of patients needing organ donations, leading to increased waiting times. Prof Peter Friend, director of the Oxford Transplant Centre, told the BBC: ""Every transplant that does not take place now means that a patient somewhere, and at some point, never receives their transplant.""

US infectious disease specialist Dr Fauci says the expectation that students will go back to school in the autumn would be a ""bit of a bridge too far"". Neither testing nor a vaccine will be available enough to allow students  to go back so soon, he says. ""Even at the top speed weâre going we donât see a vaccine playing in the ability of individuals to get back to school this fall."" Several US states have already cancelled classes for the remainder of this school year. Testifying before the US Senate, the country's top infectious disease specialist Dr Fauci has said the US needs to ""go by the guidelines"" - referring to the White House plans for ""opening up America again"". The three-phased approach is based on the advice of public health experts. Among its key recommendations, US states should have a ""downward trajectory of positive tests"" or a ""downward trajectory of documented cases"" of coronavirus over two weeks, while conducting contact tracing and ""sentinel surveillance"" to screen for asymptomatic carriers, especially in vulnerable populations. In anticipation of his testimony, Dr Fauci warned of ""needless suffering and death"" if states preempt these guidelines. Already, more than half of US states have begun to reopen, or have plans to do so soon. Georgia, Texas and South Carolina are among the states who have made significant strides to reopen. With more than 80,000 deaths in the US already, Dr Fauci has warned of unnecessary suffering if states reopen prematurely There are now more than 226,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 32,600 people have died, according to the latest government figures. New figures released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) on Tuesday suggest the total number of deaths relating to coronavirus had reached more than 36,000 by 1 May. The difference in numbers is because the government looks at only those who tested positive for the virus, whereas the ONS looks at all death certificates which mentioned Covid-19 - which is also why their figures lag behind. A third way of counting coronavirus deaths is to look at all those who have died over and above the expected total for this time of year and it comes to more than 50,000 by 1 May. This figure is likely to include undiagnosed coronavirus deaths, as well as others indirectly caused by the pandemic. Another 627 deaths were announced on Tuesday, bringing the total number of deaths in the UK to 32,692. Almost 1.5 million people have now been tested. In the most recent 24-hour period, the total number of tests fell below the government's current target of 100,000 per day. That figure includes test kits sent to individuals or to testing locations but not yet analysed or returned, as well as tests fully processed through the relevant UK labs. This chart shows that though the number of tests carried out each day is now far higher than it was a month ago, the target of 100,000 tests per day has only been hit three times since the beginning of May.

Daniel SandfordHome Affairs Correspondent The new unit which will setEngland's official Covid-19 ""alert level""will be run by a senior specialist in counter-terrorism. Tom Hurd, who currently runs the Office for Security and Counter Terrorism, will be taking on the role leading the Joint Biosecurity Centre. Until that team is set up, chief medical officer Chris Whitty will decide the threat level of the virus. It is currently at level four, with five the highest, but the prime minister said it was heading towards level three in his speech on Sunday. The unit will draw on public data and bring together epidemiological expertise with ""the best analytical capability across government"". A Coronavirus Status Checker has also been created to give health professionals âgreater insightâ into how the virus is affecting the country. Mr Hurd has previously been talked about as a possible leader of MI5 or MI6 and is the son of former Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, now Lord Hurd of Westwell. Ministers will consider whether the Joint Biosecurity Centre will remain a permanent unit once the Covid-19 threat has subsided.

Nick Thorpe, BBC News Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban was granted power to rule by decree during the pandemic Preliminary results from an ongoing medical survey of the Hungarian population suggest that around 1% have caught coronavirus. Of 8,700 people, only two tested positive, while nine had already had it. The tests are voluntary, and do not include patients in institutions like elderly care homes. In the next week, 9,000 more will be tested. Hungary's official statistics show 3,300 people have had the virus, while 425 have died. The survey suggests that between 0.27% and 1.1% of the population are believed to have had the virus - meaning between 22,000 and 93,000 people among the 8.3m Hungarians aged 14 and over. Hungary has been one of the European countries least affected by coronavirus, but its government has adopted some of the most draconian powers, including the right to rule by decree until it deems the emergency over. Prime Minister Viktor Orban said it was necessary to ""prepare for the worst, and hope for the best"". He ordered 36,000 of the countryâs 65,000 hospital beds to be readied for coronavirus patients. No more than 1,000 were filled at any one time. A ministerial order for all seriously ill coronavirus patients in the country to be transferred to two Budapest hospitals, issued last Friday, was abruptly cancelled over the weekend. A senior doctor, who asked not to be named, told the BBC that the handling of the pandemic by medical staff had been exemplary. Social-distancing measures introduced early on by the government, and the self-discipline of the population in staying at home, were the main factors in Hungaryâs success, he said. Rock star Bryan Adams has apologised after posting an expletive-laden coronavirus rant on social media, saying he has ""love for all people and my thoughts are with everyone dealing with this pandemic around the world"". On Monday, he wrote: ""Thanks to some bat eating, wet market animal selling, virus making greedy [expletives], the whole world is now on hold."" Manyinterpreted the star's commentsas anti-Asian or anti-Chinese, but he was praised by some animal rights groups. ""Apologies to any and all that took offence to my posting yesterday,""Adams said in a new post on Tuesday.,external ""No excuse, I just wanted to have a rant about the horrible animal cruelty in these wet markets being the possible source of the virus, and promote veganism."" The Canadian singer was due to be performing in London this week, before lockdown measures came into force. France has overtaken Spain in the number of coronavirus deaths it has officially recorded, making it the world's fourth worst-affected country (after the US, the UK and Italy). The latest daily toll of 348 deaths takes the country's overall total to 26,991 - 17,003 of those have come in hospital and 9,988 in care homes. However, the number of people in hospital and intensive care with the virus has fallen. Experts warn that it is hard to make precise international comparisons between death tolls as countries do not record deaths in exactly the same way. Even pandas aren't immune to Covid-19 supply chain disruptions. The Calgary Zoo is returning two giant pandas back to China years ahead of schedule because ofproblems obtaining bamboo,external. Pandas need to eat about 40kg (88lb) of bamboo, which grows in Asia, a day. But cancelled flights and delays have made it difficult to ship to Canada, and the zoo has decided the pandas -Er Shun and Da Mao,external- would be better off back in China, where supplies of the right sort of bamboo are plentiful. Giant pandas eat bamboo - and lots of it If people returning to work in England do not feel safe, they should take it up with their bosses and can call on the health and safety body, Business Secretary Alok Sharma told reporters at the UK government's daily briefing.

Ben Kelly, 26, was killed at Sand Dollar Beach in California which, according toNBC,,externalis the first fatal shark attack in the state since 2012. Wildlife biologist Forrest Galante said animals are relaxing and occupying areas where there are fewer humans because of the coronavirus pandemic. When sharks attack surfers it is ""always a case of mistaken identity"" because they are hunting for seals or sealions, Galante added. âAll these times you have human-predator conflict because we are invading their space, not because they are coming into our space,â he toldTMZ.,external Many surfers have been staying indoors since the coronavirus restrictions were imposed, leading to an increase of shark sightings on the northern California coastline. Photographer Eric Mailander told the KRON4 station he has observed ""dozens of great white sharks"" swimming near the shoreline.

"This video can not be played Matt Hancock: ""Unlikely that big, lavish international holidays are going to possible for this summer"" Many British people are unlikely to be able to take foreign holidays this summer because of coronavirus, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said. He told ITV's This Morning it's ""likely to be the case"" there won't be a normal summer holiday season. The government is opening up parts of the economy, and Ryanair is planning to start services in July. But Mr Hancock said the traditional big-break holiday season is unlikely. Social distancing will have to be maintained for some time, he said. ""The conclusion from that is it is unlikely that big, lavish international holidays are going to be possible for this summer."" What are the new travel quarantine rules? How will transport need to change? Mr Hancock's comments came as many airlines detailed plans to restart flights. Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary, who last month said that leaving the middle seat free to help social distancing was ""idiotic"", said he planned to sell as many seats as possible this summer. The airline is planning to operate nearly 1,000 flights a day from July, up from 30 today. It said face coverings being worn by all crew and passengers and cashless on-board transactions would help keep passengers safe as well as a new system for toilet breaks. Passengers will haveto ask crew to use the toiletto stop queues forming. Meanwhile, EasyJet has told the BBC that it does not have a date for restarting flights, but is keeping the situation under review. The announcement came despite government plans to introducea 14-day quarantine for international travellersto prevent a second spike in the virus, infuriating airlines which planned to resume flying in the coming months. Willie Walsh, boss of rival firm IAG, which owns British Airways, criticised the move, warning it would force him to review his plans to ramp up flights in the summer. ""There's nothing positive in anything I heard the prime minister say [on Sunday],"" he told MPs. Virgin Atlantic also released its summer schedule for 2021 on Tuesday, promising more flights to Tel Aviv as well as routes linking Florida with Manchester, Glasgow, London Heathrow and Belfast after it pulled out of Gatwick. Scenes that are unlikely to be seen this summer John and Irene Hays, owners of travel company Hays Travel,which took over Thomas Cook's shops last year, said the news has not dampened people's enthusiasm to get away. Mr Hay told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""There is a real desire to go on holiday. People have been locked down, and in terms of new bookings we're getting strong demand."" Talking about trips which were booked earlier in the year, Mrs Hays added: ""Many people are not cancelling, they are just deferring their holiday or in some cases holding on to a credit note for now."" Mr Hays also thought that having to self-isolate at home for 14 days after returning from abroad may not stop people travelling. ""If people in the UK are already in lockdown, they might be happy to spend another fortnight at home. Some people might say go to Spain or somewhere, have a nice holiday and then come back and continue their lockdown,"" he said. Mr Hancock's comments echo those from Transport Secretary Grant Shapps last month who warned people not to book summer holidays - domestic and overseas - until social distancing rules are relaxed. ""I won't be booking a summer holiday at this point,"" he told the BBC on 17 April. Airlines, and the travel industry generally, have been among the biggest financial losers of the international lockdown. Aircraft fleets have been grounded and thousands of job cuts announced, withBritish Airways shedding 12,000  jobsandVirgin 3,000 jobs. LOCKDOWN UPDATE:What's changing, where?

"This video can not be played The BBC's political editor asks Rishi Sunak if the UK is looking at a recession due to the coronavirus outbreak. The chancellor turned 40 today. The tiny number of staff at work in Number 11 did make an effort at celebration in these grim times with, apparently, a few balloons in the office. There is, though, not much time in government for anything other than trying to get through this emergency - nor anything to celebrate. The impact on the economy has already been so extreme that Rishi Sunak confirmed today that the taxpayer will carry on paying 80% of the wages of more than seven million people until the end of July and then sharing the cost of that with employers, extending the furlough scheme until the end of October. The idea is the Treasury picks up swathes of the country's wage bill so that businesses can close their doors but can keep their staff on standby. The plan has, ministers firmly believe, staved off a much, much more serious economic disaster where we'd be heading into a period of mass unemployment. By carrying on for a few more months, the hope is to keep the brakes on, to stop a slide into profound and prolonged downturn. There are fears about the extension, however: not least how much businesses will be asked to share the bill from August. What happens to businesses who still haven't reopened by then and still have no income, so can't split the bill? What about businesses who decide not to reopen? UK furlough scheme extended by four months What does it mean if I've been furloughed by work? There are also fears among some ministers about how extending the scheme for every part of the economy reduces the incentive for people to go back to work and businesses to reopen too. But, in the months to come, the question for the government is likely to extend far beyond the dilemmas over furlough. More broadly, they may have to consider which sectors of the economy do they ask the taxpayer to help preserve, and which do they let go? In this emergency phase, we are living with an astonishing level of state support being lent to keep big swathes of the economy afloat. This chancellor and this Tory government are prepared to wear massive levels of borrowing for the foreseeable future. There will, in time, be a limit and an end point to how much more to add. But many industries' models may not work for a long time; the sums may simply not add up. Rishi Sunak may therefore have to decide whether it's the right thing to keep propping up business and industries whose future after corona may not be viable. That's not just a decision about what we need, and how we want to earn our living as a country in the future, but a series of political choices about what the economy ought to look like in the years to come. LOCKDOWN:How will it change now? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? EXERCISE:What are the guidelines on getting out? SCHOOLS:When will children be returning? When ministers make decisions about the best use of taxpayers' money - awful though it may be to consider - the changes that Covid-19 has forced on our way of life may mean that some previously successful businesses may simply not be able to make the sums work for a very long time on the other side. Not that long ago, the chancellor and others talked brightly of a swift bounce back to the economy. It is, of course, possible that may yet happen. There is, and will continue to be, vigorous economic debate about exactly what the numbers display. But politically a mood is sinking in now, that very hard decisions about the shape of the country's income will have to be made. When we asked him today about whether we're facing recession, the chancellor was reluctant to use the ""r"" word - recession - but accepted there were signs it was already happening. He says his own ""heart breaks"" as people are already losing their jobs. But it may not be long before he and the prime minister have no choice but to acknowledge the economic reality more explicitly - the sting in the virus' poisonous tail may be hardship for massive numbers of people in the country and harder decisions for Number 11 too.

"The furlough scheme, which protected millions of jobs during the pandemic, is being wound up at the end of September. The government has been paying towards the wages of people who couldn't work, or whose employers could no longer afford to pay them, up to a monthly limit of Â£2,500. At first it paid 80% of the wages, but in August and September it paid 60%, with employers paying 20%. The most recent figures show1.6 million people were on furlough at the end of July- the lowest level since the start of the pandemic and 340,000 fewer than a month earlier. Nearlyone million workers were expected to still be on the scheme at the end of September, according to research by the Resolution Foundation. The numbers have dropped as the economy reopened. In May 2020, nearly nine million people were on furlough. What impact has the furlough scheme had? High numbers of workers in restaurants and hotels were furloughed Some employers with workers on furlough may find they cannot afford to keep them on when furlough ends. International travel, and other businesses which depend on it, are still seriously disrupted. Some furloughed workers in these areas may lose their jobs. Many forecasters, including the Bank of England, are expecting a small rise in unemployment. How many people could lose their jobs? How do I find a new job and who is hiring? If you were made redundant while on furlough, you have a number of legal rights. The selection process must be fair, you must be given notice, and you are entitled to tax-free redundancy pay. Government guidance: Furlough and redundancy,external Government guidance: Redundancy and benefits,external What are my rights if I am made redundant? If you've been made redundant - or been told that you will soon be made redundant - there are three main types of financial support that you may be entitled to: Universal credit,external New Style Jobseeker's Allowance,external(New Style JSA), or New Style Employment and Support Allowance,external(New Style ESA) You might be able to claim a combination of these benefits. The amount of help you get depends on your personal circumstances, including the amount of national insurance contributions you made while you were employed. You may be entitled to extra money if you have children or are a carer, or have a disability or health condition. You may also be entitled to help with housing costs. There is lots of free benefits guidance and advice available, including: There are a number offree online benefits calculators,externalfrom organisations includingentitledto,external,Turn2Us,external, andPolicy in Practice,external TheMoney Navigator tool,externalfrom the Money and Pensions Service relates to coronavirus-related money matters Further guidance is available fromCitizens Advice,externaland from theLow Incomes Tax Reform Group,external The government says 11.6 million jobs have been supported by the scheme. From March 2020 to the end of September 2021, the cost of furlough will come to about Â£66bn, according to estimates from the Office for Budget Responsibility. That's a huge sum, around one fifth of the money the government has spent on the response to Covid. The Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, launched the furlough scheme in March 2020 However, the scheme has undoubtedly helped to save millions of jobs. At the start of the pandemic it was feared that more than one in 10 workers would become unemployed. Instead the unemployment rate is currently less than one in 20. VACCINE:When will I get my jab?

"Millions of workers are receiving a smaller pay packet as the economic realities of coronavirus bite. Struggling companies and self-employed workers have been offered financial help by the government, to help keep their businesses afloat and staff paid during the coronavirus outbreak. But, with millions on reduced wages, who is affected and what happens when workers fall ill? If you work in the private sector, and pay tax through the pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) system, your employer can put you on furlough - essentially, lay you off temporarily -by applying for a government grant,externalto pay 80% of your gross salary up to a limit of Â£2,500 per month. What does it mean if I've been furloughed by work? More than eight million workers have been furloughed since March, at a cost of billions of pounds to the government. Full and part-time employees are eligible, as are those on agency, flexible or zero-hour contracts. The typical full-time worker is paid Â£585 a week,external, about Â£2,340 a month, using a median average - the middle point of all workers. It has been hoped the grants, available through Revenue & Customs (HMRC) by the end of April, will stop big redundancy announcements. The money was backdated to March and the scheme will last until the end of October. New rules will apply over the summer that will see employers sharing some of the burden of these costs. Employers will be able to bring back furloughed employees part-time from July - although they will be expected to share the cost of paying people's salaries. An employer still pays their staff, and can decide whether to pay in full or only the 80% that has been covered. Ria Fortin only started her job as a coordinator with Morepour, a cellar and bar installation and maintenance company, four months ago. Now, she has been furloughed. ""There was an intake of breath when I was paid. It was not as much as I have been used to,"" says the 34-year-old, who has just bought a home with her self-employed partner. ""But it is a relief just to be paid. At least it is something. Other people are in a much worse situation."" Ria Fortin says she feels lucky to still have her job The company she works for is small, so she feels grateful to have been furloughed, rather than laid off, given that the hospitality industry may be one of the last to reopen. The couple have organised payment holidays on regular bills, but know these will eventually have to be paid, so Ria - a former NHS worker - says they are very conscious of budgeting. If you are self-employed and have had a loss of income,you can receive a taxable grantof 80% of your average monthly profits over the past three years - up to a cap of Â£2,500 per month. Initially, this has been available for three months in one lump-sum payment. A ""second and final"" payment, covering another three months and representing 70% of profits up to a cap of Â£2,190 a month will be available from August. You can access theCoronavirus Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS),externalas long as you traded in the past financial year, are still trading now and plan to continue doing so. Most of your income needs to come from self-employment and your average trading profit needs to have been less than Â£50,000 a year. If you became self-employed since April 2019, you will not receive any help under this scheme. This is because you haven't yet have filed a tax return, which is needed to help calculate financial support. HMRC will contact those who are eligible. You will have to try to claim benefits - such asuniversal credit,externaland/or contribution-basedemployment and support allowance (ESA),external. In his Budget, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said claimants could apply for ESA straight away, rather than waiting a week. He also temporarily removed the minimum income floor criteria for self-employed people - which looked at how much people could expect to earn in a month to calculate universal credit levels. Self-employed people not covered by the SEISS can now access universal credit in full, potentially allowing them to receivea payment equivalent to statutory sick pay (SSP). However, this does depend on your household's financial situation. If you are already in receipt of other benefits, these could stop when applying for universal credit, so it may be worth getting some advice. You can now apply on the phone or online, instead of having to attend a job centre. Benefit levels have also been increased temporarily. Rishi Sunak's 2020 budget speech in full,external What is universal credit? You should continue to work and have your wages paid as normal, even if you are home-working or have been told to work at another location temporarily. If you can work from home, you should do so. Working hours can still be clearly defined. Employers still have a duty of care and are responsible for any equipment they give you. The Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Servicehas set out guidance.,external If you are an employee, your employermust give you time off,externalin an emergency. But you might not get paid - it depends on the terms of your work contract. However, many bosses during this period are allowing parents to work flexibly, to try to manage both work and childcare.

AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash If you are an employee, any sick pay you may receive will depend on where you work. Some workers' contracts offer full pay to those off ill - albeit for a limited time. If that time runs out, or if you don't get paid sick leave in the first place,you should receive SSP.,external The money - set at Â£95.85 a week - is paid by employers for up to 28 weeks. So if you are self-employed, you will not be eligible - but if you are a casual or agency worker, you will be. To receive SSP you need to be earning at least Â£120 a week.The ONS estimates,externalthere are 1,766,000 adult jobs in the UK that pay less than that amount - although some people will earn money from several jobs over the course of a week. SSP can now be claimed from a person's first day away from work, rather than the fourth day as before. Anyone claiming should be able to get a sick note from the NHS's 111 service rather than their GP. There have been concerns aboutwhether SSP is sufficient, especially for those who must self-isolate more than once following the introduction of the various test and trace systems.

"People across the country have to wear face coverings in certain circumstances when out of the house, to help limit the spread of coronavirus. It is compulsory to wear one on public transport and in shops, supermarkets and shopping centres. While medical face masks and respirators are prioritised for health and care workers, you might want to try making your own face covering. Here's our guide to different types and step-by-step instructions on how to make them. Whether you're handy with a sewing machine, like cutting up old t-shirts or just want a quick fix, the principles are the same: the more layers of material the better, and the mask needs to fit snugly around the face, covering the nose and mouth, and you should be able to breathe comfortably. One study has shown thatthe best materials to use,externalare tightly woven cottons or twill, natural silk or quilted cotton material. But you can also make do with what you have around your home. Let's start with a simple one. The government advises washing your hands thoroughly or using hand sanitiser before putting on and after taking off face coverings. Make sure the mask covers your nose and mouth Avoid touching the mask, your eyes, nose, or mouth at all times Try not to keeping taking it off and putting it back on again, eg when going in and out of shops Store used face coverings in a plastic bag until you have an opportunity to wash them Wash a face covering regularly - it can go in with other laundry, using your normal detergent VIDEO: How to wear a face covering safely Foggy glasses, recycling, kids: Your guide to wearing a mask Our next example uses an old t-shirt, preferably thick cotton or a cotton and polyester mix. And still nothing to sew. Homemade masks are not necessarily intended to help the wearer, the government says, but they could help stop you inadvertently passing on the disease to others if you have it but are not showing symptoms. If you do have coronavirus symptoms - such as a high temperature or continuous cough, you should stay indoors and isolate at home. Whichever face covering you use, they are not a substitute for other guidance, such as social distancing and hand washing. Hand hygiene especially is just as important as before - so washing your hands with soap for at least 20 seconds when you get home. FACE MASKS:Should I be wearing one? Our third example needs a few stitches, but they can be as simple or as complicated as you like - as long as it all holds in place and survives a few washes. There are plenty of other ways to make a face covering - and many examples on social media from professional, designer logo'd masks to cut-up sports socks. UK government: How to make a face covering,external Have fun giving them a go. Remember you might need more than one, so you have something to use while the other is being washed. Face coverings should not be used for children under the age of two years or people who might not be able to fit them correctly. When you have your mask, here are a few reminders of whatnotto do.

"This video can not be played The BBC's political editor asks Rishi Sunak if the UK is looking at a recession due to the coronavirus outbreak. The UK scheme to pay wages of workers on leave because of coronavirus will be extended to October, Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said. Mr Sunak confirmed that employees will continue to receive 80% of their monthly wages up to Â£2,500. But he said the government will ask companies to ""start sharing"" the cost of the scheme from August. A quarter of the workforce, some 7.5 million people, are now covered by the scheme, which has cost Â£14bn a month. The chancellor said that from August, the scheme would continue for all sectors and regions of the country but with greater flexibility to support the transition back to work. Employers currently using the scheme will then be able to bring furloughed employees back part-time. Mr Sunak will attempt slowly to reduce the cost to the taxpayer of the subsidy scheme, but full details are still to be worked out. However, sources have told the BBC the Treasury stills expects to be paying more than half the costs between August and October. Later on Tuesday,in an interview with the BBC, Mr Sunak said the number of job losses ""breaks my heart"", adding: ""That's why I'm working night and day to limit the amount of job losses."" Mr Sunak told the Commons said: ""I'm extending the scheme because I won't give up on the people who rely on it. ""Our message today is simple: we stood behind Britain's workers and businesses as we came into this crisis, and we will stand behind them as we come through the other side."" There has been growing concern about the cost of the scheme, and last week Mr Sunak said it could not continue in its current form. However, he was under pressure to announce changes soon to avoid a so-called ""cliff edge"" in which employers begin mass redundancies. Any company seeking to cut more than 100 jobs must run a 45-day consultation, meaning 18 May was the last date employers could start this process before the furlough scheme ended in June. The chancellor rejected suggestions some people might get ""addicted"" to furlough if it was extended. ""Nobody who is on the furlough scheme wants to be on this scheme,"" the chancellor said. ""People up and down this country believe in the dignity of their work, going to work, providing for their families, it's not their fault their business has been asked to close or asked to stay at home."" Hard decisions over the economy loom What does it mean if I've been furloughed by work? Why payday is different during the crisis PM 'not expecting' flood of people back to work Shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said broadly welcomed the changes, saying ""at least we are moving in the right direction"". But she said the ""big elephant in the room"" is over what the government's employer contribution will involve, adding that the ""critical point is that any changes to the scheme must not result in any spike in unemployment"". Despite the extension of the furlough scheme, Patrick Langmaid said it's still unlikely to stop him making people redundant from his Mother Ivey's Bay holiday park, at Padstow. He has furloughed seven staff and has nine still working. The handful of staff he would usually employ seasonally he has let go. ""There is no income - and huge costs,"" he says. ""We are very worried about how we, as employers, are going to make contributions through August, September and October [when employers will be expected to share the costs of the scheme]"", he said. ""I am very, very worried about how I am going to cope in the winter. ""I've already started briefing my team that there will have to be redundancies,"" he says. He reckons four or five jobs may have to go, depending how long the lockdown lasts. Dealing with redundancy is ""horrible"", he says, adding: ""It is really not a nice time to be running a business."" Businesses largely welcomed the extension, with business group the British Chambers of Commerce saying the move would bring ""significant relief"" to employers and workers, And Stephen Phipson, chief executive of manufacturing group Make UK, said it would avoid ""a looming cliff edge triggering significant redundancies for many companies and recognises the need for greater flexibility as the economy fires up."" However, he warned that there was no ""silver bullet"" and that both government and industry would have to be flexible. There was also support from the TUC, with general secretary Frances O'Grady saying the extension ""will be a big relief for millions"". But she added: ""As the economic consequences of Covid-19 become clear, unions will keep pushing for a job guarantee scheme to make sure everyone has a decent job."" Paul Johnson, director of the Institute of Fiscal Studies economic think tank, estimates the scheme will have cost nearly Â£100bn by October. It is thought that about 935,000 businesses signed up for the scheme in total. Reports of the demise of the furlough scheme have been somewhat exaggerated. It was never going to be scrapped, especially after the Bank of England stressed the scheme's importance for economic recovery. Over a quarter of all jobs - 27%, 7.5 million in total - are now paid for by the taxpayer, potentially for eight months. After that, the level of subsidy from taxpayer will be lowered, with employers expected to pay a contribution. By August, the scheme could start to look quite similar to longer standing wage subsidy schemes seen in continental Europe. The cost of the scheme to date is already over Â£10bn. This extension will be tens of billions more, but difficult to put a precise number on this given the lack of detail on the ""employer contribution"". Expensive yes. But what is also costly is letting unemployment sky rocket, as, without the extension, many businesses would have begun 45-day redundancy consultations this week. The question now is how many businesses still see this as a bridge to some sort of normality where furloughed staff can be phased back into their old jobs. Unfortunately some in industries which will not return to normal have already started to fire staff. This announcement buys most workers more time. LOCKDOWN UPDATE:What's changing, where?

Despite the extension of the furlough scheme, Patrick Langmaid said it's still unlikely to stop him making people redundant from his Mother Ivey's Bay holiday park, at Padstow. He has furloughed seven staff and has nine still working. The handful of staff he would usually employ seasonally he has let go. ""There is no income - and huge costs,"" he says. ""We are very worried about how we, as employers, are going to make contributions through August, September and October [when employers will be expected to share the costs of the scheme]"", he said. ""I am very, very worried about how I am going to cope in the winter. ""I've already started briefing my team that there will have to be redundancies,"" he says. He reckons four or five jobs may have to go, depending how long the lockdown lasts. Dealing with redundancy is ""horrible"", he says, adding: ""It is really not a nice time to be running a business."" Businesses largely welcomed the extension, with business group the British Chambers of Commerce saying the move would bring ""significant relief"" to employers and workers, And Stephen Phipson, chief executive of manufacturing group Make UK, said it would avoid ""a looming cliff edge triggering significant redundancies for many companies and recognises the need for greater flexibility as the economy fires up."" However, he warned that there was no ""silver bullet"" and that both government and industry would have to be flexible. There was also support from the TUC, with general secretary Frances O'Grady saying the extension ""will be a big relief for millions"". But she added: ""As the economic consequences of Covid-19 become clear, unions will keep pushing for a job guarantee scheme to make sure everyone has a decent job."" Paul Johnson, director of the Institute of Fiscal Studies economic think tank, estimates the scheme will have cost nearly Â£100bn by October. It is thought that about 935,000 businesses signed up for the scheme in total. Reports of the demise of the furlough scheme have been somewhat exaggerated. It was never going to be scrapped, especially after the Bank of England stressed the scheme's importance for economic recovery. Over a quarter of all jobs - 27%, 7.5 million in total - are now paid for by the taxpayer, potentially for eight months. After that, the level of subsidy from taxpayer will be lowered, with employers expected to pay a contribution. By August, the scheme could start to look quite similar to longer standing wage subsidy schemes seen in continental Europe. The cost of the scheme to date is already over Â£10bn. This extension will be tens of billions more, but difficult to put a precise number on this given the lack of detail on the ""employer contribution"". Expensive yes. But what is also costly is letting unemployment sky rocket, as, without the extension, many businesses would have begun 45-day redundancy consultations this week. The question now is how many businesses still see this as a bridge to some sort of normality where furloughed staff can be phased back into their old jobs. Unfortunately some in industries which will not return to normal have already started to fire staff. This announcement buys most workers more time. LOCKDOWN UPDATE:What's changing, where?

Fewer than 100 organ transplants were carried out in the UK last month, the lowest number for 36 years, causing concerns that waiting times for patients could increase. NHS Blood and Transplant analysis showed there were 99 operations in April, down from 244 in March. The last time the monthly total dropped below 100 was February 1984. Some specialists fear the fall in the number of operations will cause a backlog of patients needing organ donations, leading to increased waiting times. Prof Peter Friend, director of the Oxford Transplant Centre, told the BBC: ""Every transplant that does not take place now means that a patient somewhere, and at some point, never receives their transplant.""

""The record low numbers were mainly due to the effects of coronavirus, which have also delayed the reporting of border crossing data by national authorities,"" Frontex said. Thousands of illegal migrants every year make perilous journeys across the Mediterranean, trying to reach Europe. The other main migratory route is the Western Balkans. US infectious disease specialist Dr Fauci says the expectation that students will go back to school in the autumn would be a ""bit of a bridge too far"". Neither testing nor a vaccine will be available enough to allow students  to go back so soon, he says. ""Even at the top speed weâre going we donât see a vaccine playing in the ability of individuals to get back to school this fall."" Several US states have already cancelled classes for the remainder of this school year. Testifying before the US Senate, the country's top infectious disease specialist Dr Fauci has said the US needs to ""go by the guidelines"" - referring to the White House plans for ""opening up America again"". The three-phased approach is based on the advice of public health experts. Among its key recommendations, US states should have a ""downward trajectory of positive tests"" or a ""downward trajectory of documented cases"" of coronavirus over two weeks, while conducting contact tracing and ""sentinel surveillance"" to screen for asymptomatic carriers, especially in vulnerable populations. In anticipation of his testimony, Dr Fauci warned of ""needless suffering and death"" if states preempt these guidelines. Already, more than half of US states have begun to reopen, or have plans to do so soon. Georgia, Texas and South Carolina are among the states who have made significant strides to reopen. With more than 80,000 deaths in the US already, Dr Fauci has warned of unnecessary suffering if states reopen prematurely There are now more than 226,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 32,600 people have died, according to the latest government figures. New figures released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) on Tuesday suggest the total number of deaths relating to coronavirus had reached more than 36,000 by 1 May. The difference in numbers is because the government looks at only those who tested positive for the virus, whereas the ONS looks at all death certificates which mentioned Covid-19 - which is also why their figures lag behind. A third way of counting coronavirus deaths is to look at all those who have died over and above the expected total for this time of year and it comes to more than 50,000 by 1 May. This figure is likely to include undiagnosed coronavirus deaths, as well as others indirectly caused by the pandemic. Another 627 deaths were announced on Tuesday, bringing the total number of deaths in the UK to 32,692. Almost 1.5 million people have now been tested. In the most recent 24-hour period, the total number of tests fell below the government's current target of 100,000 per day. That figure includes test kits sent to individuals or to testing locations but not yet analysed or returned, as well as tests fully processed through the relevant UK labs. This chart shows that though the number of tests carried out each day is now far higher than it was a month ago, the target of 100,000 tests per day has only been hit three times since the beginning of May.

Daniel SandfordHome Affairs Correspondent The new unit which will setEngland's official Covid-19 ""alert level""will be run by a senior specialist in counter-terrorism. Tom Hurd, who currently runs the Office for Security and Counter Terrorism, will be taking on the role leading the Joint Biosecurity Centre. Until that team is set up, chief medical officer Chris Whitty will decide the threat level of the virus. It is currently at level four, with five the highest, but the prime minister said it was heading towards level three in his speech on Sunday. The unit will draw on public data and bring together epidemiological expertise with ""the best analytical capability across government"". A Coronavirus Status Checker has also been created to give health professionals âgreater insightâ into how the virus is affecting the country. Mr Hurd has previously been talked about as a possible leader of MI5 or MI6 and is the son of former Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, now Lord Hurd of Westwell. Ministers will consider whether the Joint Biosecurity Centre will remain a permanent unit once the Covid-19 threat has subsided. Pictures of rainbows have been springing up in windows across the UK, since lockown began.

But under new rules, estate agents can open, viewings can be carried out, and removal firms and conveyancers can re-start operations.

Nick Thorpe, BBC News Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban was granted power to rule by decree during the pandemic Preliminary results from an ongoing medical survey of the Hungarian population suggest that around 1% have caught coronavirus. Of 8,700 people, only two tested positive, while nine had already had it. The tests are voluntary, and do not include patients in institutions like elderly care homes. In the next week, 9,000 more will be tested. Hungary's official statistics show 3,300 people have had the virus, while 425 have died. The survey suggests that between 0.27% and 1.1% of the population are believed to have had the virus - meaning between 22,000 and 93,000 people among the 8.3m Hungarians aged 14 and over. Hungary has been one of the European countries least affected by coronavirus, but its government has adopted some of the most draconian powers, including the right to rule by decree until it deems the emergency over. Prime Minister Viktor Orban said it was necessary to ""prepare for the worst, and hope for the best"". He ordered 36,000 of the countryâs 65,000 hospital beds to be readied for coronavirus patients. No more than 1,000 were filled at any one time. A ministerial order for all seriously ill coronavirus patients in the country to be transferred to two Budapest hospitals, issued last Friday, was abruptly cancelled over the weekend. A senior doctor, who asked not to be named, told the BBC that the handling of the pandemic by medical staff had been exemplary. Social-distancing measures introduced early on by the government, and the self-discipline of the population in staying at home, were the main factors in Hungaryâs success, he said. Rock star Bryan Adams has apologised after posting an expletive-laden coronavirus rant on social media, saying he has ""love for all people and my thoughts are with everyone dealing with this pandemic around the world"". On Monday, he wrote: ""Thanks to some bat eating, wet market animal selling, virus making greedy [expletives], the whole world is now on hold."" Manyinterpreted the star's commentsas anti-Asian or anti-Chinese, but he was praised by some animal rights groups. ""Apologies to any and all that took offence to my posting yesterday,""Adams said in a new post on Tuesday.,external ""No excuse, I just wanted to have a rant about the horrible animal cruelty in these wet markets being the possible source of the virus, and promote veganism."" The Canadian singer was due to be performing in London this week, before lockdown measures came into force. France has overtaken Spain in the number of coronavirus deaths it has officially recorded, making it the world's fourth worst-affected country (after the US, the UK and Italy). The latest daily toll of 348 deaths takes the country's overall total to 26,991 - 17,003 of those have come in hospital and 9,988 in care homes. However, the number of people in hospital and intensive care with the virus has fallen. Experts warn that it is hard to make precise international comparisons between death tolls as countries do not record deaths in exactly the same way. Even pandas aren't immune to Covid-19 supply chain disruptions. The Calgary Zoo is returning two giant pandas back to China years ahead of schedule because ofproblems obtaining bamboo,external. Pandas need to eat about 40kg (88lb) of bamboo, which grows in Asia, a day. But cancelled flights and delays have made it difficult to ship to Canada, and the zoo has decided the pandas -Er Shun and Da Mao,external- would be better off back in China, where supplies of the right sort of bamboo are plentiful. Giant pandas eat bamboo - and lots of it If people returning to work in England do not feel safe, they should take it up with their bosses and can call on the health and safety body, Business Secretary Alok Sharma told reporters at the UK government's daily briefing.

Ben Kelly, 26, was killed at Sand Dollar Beach in California which, according toNBC,,externalis the first fatal shark attack in the state since 2012. Wildlife biologist Forrest Galante said animals are relaxing and occupying areas where there are fewer humans because of the coronavirus pandemic. When sharks attack surfers it is ""always a case of mistaken identity"" because they are hunting for seals or sealions, Galante added. âAll these times you have human-predator conflict because we are invading their space, not because they are coming into our space,â he toldTMZ.,external Many surfers have been staying indoors since the coronavirus restrictions were imposed, leading to an increase of shark sightings on the northern California coastline. Photographer Eric Mailander told the KRON4 station he has observed ""dozens of great white sharks"" swimming near the shoreline.

Corner-flags, balls, cones, goalposts and even playing surfaces will also be disinfected after each training session, which will be restricted to 75 minutes.

Some specialists fear the fall in the number of operations will cause a backlog of patients needing organ donations, leading to increased waiting times. Prof Peter Friend, director of the Oxford Transplant Centre, told the BBC: ""Every transplant that does not take place now means that a patient somewhere, and at some point, never receives their transplant.""

US infectious disease specialist Dr Fauci says the expectation that students will go back to school in the autumn would be a ""bit of a bridge too far"". Neither testing nor a vaccine will be available enough to allow students  to go back so soon, he says. ""Even at the top speed weâre going we donât see a vaccine playing in the ability of individuals to get back to school this fall."" Several US states have already cancelled classes for the remainder of this school year. Testifying before the US Senate, the country's top infectious disease specialist Dr Fauci has said the US needs to ""go by the guidelines"" - referring to the White House plans for ""opening up America again"". The three-phased approach is based on the advice of public health experts. Among its key recommendations, US states should have a ""downward trajectory of positive tests"" or a ""downward trajectory of documented cases"" of coronavirus over two weeks, while conducting contact tracing and ""sentinel surveillance"" to screen for asymptomatic carriers, especially in vulnerable populations. In anticipation of his testimony, Dr Fauci warned of ""needless suffering and death"" if states preempt these guidelines. Already, more than half of US states have begun to reopen, or have plans to do so soon. Georgia, Texas and South Carolina are among the states who have made significant strides to reopen. With more than 80,000 deaths in the US already, Dr Fauci has warned of unnecessary suffering if states reopen prematurely There are now more than 226,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 32,600 people have died, according to the latest government figures. New figures released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) on Tuesday suggest the total number of deaths relating to coronavirus had reached more than 36,000 by 1 May. The difference in numbers is because the government looks at only those who tested positive for the virus, whereas the ONS looks at all death certificates which mentioned Covid-19 - which is also why their figures lag behind. A third way of counting coronavirus deaths is to look at all those who have died over and above the expected total for this time of year and it comes to more than 50,000 by 1 May. This figure is likely to include undiagnosed coronavirus deaths, as well as others indirectly caused by the pandemic. Another 627 deaths were announced on Tuesday, bringing the total number of deaths in the UK to 32,692. Almost 1.5 million people have now been tested. In the most recent 24-hour period, the total number of tests fell below the government's current target of 100,000 per day. That figure includes test kits sent to individuals or to testing locations but not yet analysed or returned, as well as tests fully processed through the relevant UK labs. This chart shows that though the number of tests carried out each day is now far higher than it was a month ago, the target of 100,000 tests per day has only been hit three times since the beginning of May.

Daniel SandfordHome Affairs Correspondent The new unit which will setEngland's official Covid-19 ""alert level""will be run by a senior specialist in counter-terrorism. Tom Hurd, who currently runs the Office for Security and Counter Terrorism, will be taking on the role leading the Joint Biosecurity Centre. Until that team is set up, chief medical officer Chris Whitty will decide the threat level of the virus. It is currently at level four, with five the highest, but the prime minister said it was heading towards level three in his speech on Sunday. The unit will draw on public data and bring together epidemiological expertise with ""the best analytical capability across government"". A Coronavirus Status Checker has also been created to give health professionals âgreater insightâ into how the virus is affecting the country. Mr Hurd has previously been talked about as a possible leader of MI5 or MI6 and is the son of former Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, now Lord Hurd of Westwell.

Nick Thorpe, BBC News Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban was granted power to rule by decree during the pandemic Preliminary results from an ongoing medical survey of the Hungarian population suggest that around 1% have caught coronavirus. Of 8,700 people, only two tested positive, while nine had already had it. The tests are voluntary, and do not include patients in institutions like elderly care homes. In the next week, 9,000 more will be tested. Hungary's official statistics show 3,300 people have had the virus, while 425 have died. The survey suggests that between 0.27% and 1.1% of the population are believed to have had the virus - meaning between 22,000 and 93,000 people among the 8.3m Hungarians aged 14 and over. Hungary has been one of the European countries least affected by coronavirus, but its government has adopted some of the most draconian powers, including the right to rule by decree until it deems the emergency over. Prime Minister Viktor Orban said it was necessary to ""prepare for the worst, and hope for the best"". He ordered 36,000 of the countryâs 65,000 hospital beds to be readied for coronavirus patients. No more than 1,000 were filled at any one time. A ministerial order for all seriously ill coronavirus patients in the country to be transferred to two Budapest hospitals, issued last Friday, was abruptly cancelled over the weekend. A senior doctor, who asked not to be named, told the BBC that the handling of the pandemic by medical staff had been exemplary. Social-distancing measures introduced early on by the government, and the self-discipline of the population in staying at home, were the main factors in Hungaryâs success, he said. Rock star Bryan Adams has apologised after posting an expletive-laden coronavirus rant on social media, saying he has ""love for all people and my thoughts are with everyone dealing with this pandemic around the world"".

Manyinterpreted the star's commentsas anti-Asian or anti-Chinese, but he was praised by some animal rights groups. ""Apologies to any and all that took offence to my posting yesterday,""Adams said in a new post on Tuesday.,external ""No excuse, I just wanted to have a rant about the horrible animal cruelty in these wet markets being the possible source of the virus, and promote veganism."" The Canadian singer was due to be performing in London this week, before lockdown measures came into force. France has overtaken Spain in the number of coronavirus deaths it has officially recorded, making it the world's fourth worst-affected country (after the US, the UK and Italy). The latest daily toll of 348 deaths takes the country's overall total to 26,991 - 17,003 of those have come in hospital and 9,988 in care homes. However, the number of people in hospital and intensive care with the virus has fallen. Experts warn that it is hard to make precise international comparisons between death tolls as countries do not record deaths in exactly the same way. Even pandas aren't immune to Covid-19 supply chain disruptions. The Calgary Zoo is returning two giant pandas back to China years ahead of schedule because ofproblems obtaining bamboo,external. Pandas need to eat about 40kg (88lb) of bamboo, which grows in Asia, a day. But cancelled flights and delays have made it difficult to ship to Canada, and the zoo has decided the pandas -Er Shun and Da Mao,external- would be better off back in China, where supplies of the right sort of bamboo are plentiful. Giant pandas eat bamboo - and lots of it If people returning to work in England do not feel safe, they should take it up with their bosses and can call on the health and safety body, Business Secretary Alok Sharma told reporters at the UK government's daily briefing.

Ben Kelly, 26, was killed at Sand Dollar Beach in California which, according toNBC,,externalis the first fatal shark attack in the state since 2012. Wildlife biologist Forrest Galante said animals are relaxing and occupying areas where there are fewer humans because of the coronavirus pandemic. When sharks attack surfers it is ""always a case of mistaken identity"" because they are hunting for seals or sealions, Galante added. âAll these times you have human-predator conflict because we are invading their space, not because they are coming into our space,â he toldTMZ.,external Many surfers have been staying indoors since the coronavirus restrictions were imposed, leading to an increase of shark sightings on the northern California coastline.

"This video can not be played Matt Hancock: ""Unlikely that big, lavish international holidays are going to possible for this summer"" Many British people are unlikely to be able to take foreign holidays this summer because of coronavirus, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said. He told ITV's This Morning it's ""likely to be the case"" there won't be a normal summer holiday season. The government is opening up parts of the economy, and Ryanair is planning to start services in July. But Mr Hancock said the traditional big-break holiday season is unlikely. Social distancing will have to be maintained for some time, he said. ""The conclusion from that is it is unlikely that big, lavish international holidays are going to be possible for this summer."" What are the new travel quarantine rules? How will transport need to change? Mr Hancock's comments came as many airlines detailed plans to restart flights. Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary, who last month said that leaving the middle seat free to help social distancing was ""idiotic"", said he planned to sell as many seats as possible this summer. The airline is planning to operate nearly 1,000 flights a day from July, up from 30 today. It said face coverings being worn by all crew and passengers and cashless on-board transactions would help keep passengers safe as well as a new system for toilet breaks. Passengers will haveto ask crew to use the toiletto stop queues forming. Meanwhile, EasyJet has told the BBC that it does not have a date for restarting flights, but is keeping the situation under review. The announcement came despite government plans to introducea 14-day quarantine for international travellersto prevent a second spike in the virus, infuriating airlines which planned to resume flying in the coming months. Willie Walsh, boss of rival firm IAG, which owns British Airways, criticised the move, warning it would force him to review his plans to ramp up flights in the summer. ""There's nothing positive in anything I heard the prime minister say [on Sunday],"" he told MPs. Virgin Atlantic also released its summer schedule for 2021 on Tuesday, promising more flights to Tel Aviv as well as routes linking Florida with Manchester, Glasgow, London Heathrow and Belfast after it pulled out of Gatwick. Scenes that are unlikely to be seen this summer John and Irene Hays, owners of travel company Hays Travel,which took over Thomas Cook's shops last year, said the news has not dampened people's enthusiasm to get away. Mr Hay told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""There is a real desire to go on holiday. People have been locked down, and in terms of new bookings we're getting strong demand."" Talking about trips which were booked earlier in the year, Mrs Hays added: ""Many people are not cancelling, they are just deferring their holiday or in some cases holding on to a credit note for now."" Mr Hays also thought that having to self-isolate at home for 14 days after returning from abroad may not stop people travelling. ""If people in the UK are already in lockdown, they might be happy to spend another fortnight at home. Some people might say go to Spain or somewhere, have a nice holiday and then come back and continue their lockdown,"" he said. Mr Hancock's comments echo those from Transport Secretary Grant Shapps last month who warned people not to book summer holidays - domestic and overseas - until social distancing rules are relaxed. ""I won't be booking a summer holiday at this point,"" he told the BBC on 17 April. Airlines, and the travel industry generally, have been among the biggest financial losers of the international lockdown. Aircraft fleets have been grounded and thousands of job cuts announced, withBritish Airways shedding 12,000  jobsandVirgin 3,000 jobs. LOCKDOWN UPDATE:What's changing, where?

"Harry Dunn died in hospital after his motorbike was involved in a crash outside RAF Croughton The US has said its decision to refuse an extradition request for Harry Dunn's alleged killer was final. It comes after an Interpol Red Notice was issued for US national Anne Sacoolas who is now""wanted internationally"". A US official said she had diplomatic immunity, but Downing Street branded the refusal ""a denial of justice"". Mr Dunn, 19, died after a crash in Northamptonshire, with Mrs Sacoolas accused of death by dangerous driving. The shadow foreign secretary has accused the Foreign Office of ""clear and repeated failings"". Mrs Sacoolas, the wife of a US intelligence official based at RAF Croughton, claimed diplomatic immunity following the crash and was able to return to her home country, sparking an international outcry. The Interpol Red notice means she can be arrested if she leaves the US. Mr Dunn's mother Charlotte Charles was notified by Northamptonshire Police about the Interpol notice. She said it was ""a huge step in the right direction"". Anne Sacoolas, pictured on her wedding day in 2003, cited diplomatic immunity after the crash outside RAF Croughton Motorcyclist Mr Dunn died in a crash with a car near US military base RAF Croughton on 27 August. A Home Office extradition request was refused by US secretary of state Mike Pompeo in January. On Tuesday, the state department's spokeswoman said that decision was final. She said that granting the extradition request for Mrs Sacoolas would have rendered the invocation of diplomatic immunity a practical nullity and would have set an ""extraordinarily troubling precedent"". She added that the US has a history of close law enforcement co-operation with the UK, and values that relationship. But the Prime Minister's official spokesman said Boris Johnson ""has been clear that he wants to see justice served for Harry and his family"". Mr Johnson had raised the case with Donald Trump ""on a number of occasions"", the spokesman said. ""The US refusal to extradite Anne Sacoolas amounts to a denial of justice and she should return to the UK,"" the spokesman added. Shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy has called for a parliamentary inquiry, in which the Foreign Secretary would have to explain ""failings"" with Mr Dunn's case. Road side banner supporting justice for Harry Dunn But the Dunn family spokesman Radd Seiger said: ""The White House may feel that secretary Pompeo's refusal to extradite Anne Sacoolas was final but that does not reflect the real position. ""In fact quite the contrary, as the US Embassy in London said in a recent letter to Andrea Leadsom, both countries recognise that the final decision will rest with the court following a judicial review."" An Interpol Red Notice is a request to law enforcement worldwide to locate and provisionally arrest a person pending extradition, surrender, or similar legal action.

"In 2019-20 Transport for London earned Â£4.9bn from fares - 47% of its income Transport for London (TfL) expects to lose Â£4bn this year due to the impact of coronavirus. Ahead of an emergency finance committee meeting, the organisation said it needs Â£3.2bn to balance a proposed emergency budget for next year. During the lockdown TfL has lost 90% of its overall income. Speaking at the committee meeting, Deputy Mayor for Transport Heidi Alexander said the situation was ""now critical"". ""We have to reach an agreement with the government on this in the next 48 hours,"" she said. Ms Alexander warned that TfL may be forced to issue a Section 114 notice - the equivalent of a public body going bust. ""I think the impact of the Section 114 notice is quite honestly unthinkable, with very serious implications for Tube and bus services in London,"" she added. A TfL spokesperson said it had done everything possible to help reduce the spread of coronavirus. ""This was the right thing to do and has saved lives,"" he said. ""It is clear that the long term impact of the coronavirus will mean that we need financial support now and into the future so that we can support the recovery of London and the UK. ""We are in constructive discussions with the government over the necessary financial support."" Travellers using London buses do not currently need to pay In the 2019-20 budget TfL set up a reserve of Â£2.2bn to meet future financial challenges. That yearTfL earned Â£4.9bn from fares,external, making up 47% of the transport authority's income. However, the lockdown has led to a 95% cut in people using the Tube compared to this time last year. The number of bus passengers has also dropped, by 85%, and customers no longer have to tap-in to pay for rides as part of measures to protect drivers. Most TfL services are still running, but 7,000 staff - about 25% of the workforce - have been furloughed to cut costs. Unless emergency funding can be found TfL may publish an unbalanced budget, which would ban TfL from spending any new cash. Conservative candidate for mayor of London, Shaun Bailey, said: ""Coronavirus has only accentuated existing problems. ""The 'fares freeze' - that benefitted tourists, not Londoners - cost TfL over Â£600m in lost revenue. TfL has record debt which stands at Â£13bn.

"India's CO2 emissions have fallen for the first time in four decades - and not just as a result of the country's coronavirus lockdown. Falling electricity use and competition from renewables had weakened the demand for fossil fuels even before the coronavirus hit, according toanalysis by the environmental website, Carbon Brief.,externalHowever, it was the sudden nationwide lockdown in March that finally tipped the country's 37-year emissions growth trend into reverse. The study finds that Indian carbon dioxide emissions fell 15% in March, and are likely to have fallen by 30% in April. Virtually all of the drop-off in power demand has been borne by coal-fired generators, which explains why the emissions reductions have been so dramatic. Coal-fired power generation was down 15% in March and 31% in the first three weeks of April, according to daily data from the Indian national grid. But even before India's sudden coronavirus lockdown, the demand for coal was weakening. The study finds that in the fiscal year ending March 2020, coal deliveries were down by around 2%, a small but significant reduction when set against the trend - an increase in thermal power generation of 7.5% a year set over the previous decade. Indian oil consumption shows a similar reduction in demand growth. The nationwide lockdown finally tipped a 37-year emissions growth trend into reverse It has been slowing since early 2019. And, once again, the trend has been compounded by the impact of the Covid-19 lockdown measures on the transport industry. India's double first in climate battle How India's 'smart villages' are centralising solar power Why power theft in India is a complex problem Oil consumption was down 18% year-on-year in March 2020. Meanwhile, the supply of energy from renewables has increased over the year and has held up since the pandemic struck. This resilience the renewables energy sector shows in the face of the sudden reduction in demand caused by coronavirus is not confined to India. This video can not be played Delhi smog disappears during India's lockdown According to figures published by the International Energy Agency (IEA) at the end of April, the world's use of coal was down 8% in the first quarter of the year. By contrast, wind and solar power saw a slight uptick in demand internationally. A key reason that coal has taken the brunt of the fall in electricity demand is that it cost more to run on a day-to-day basis. Once you have installed a solar panel or a wind turbine, operating costs are very low and, therefore, tend to get priority on electricity grids. India's use of coal has plummeted, in line with that of other countries Thermal power stations - those powered by coal, gas or oil - by contrast, require you to buy fuel in order to generate power. But analysts warn that the decline in fossil fuel use may not last. They say when the pandemic subsides, there is a risk that emissions will soar again as countries attempt to kick-start their economies. The US has already started to relax environmental regulations and the fear is other nations could follow suit. However, the analysis from Carbon Brief suggests there are reasons to think India could buck this trend. The coronavirus crisis has brought the long-brewing financial troubles in the Indian coal sector to a head, and the Indian government is finalising a relief package which could top 900bn rupees ($12bn; Â£9.6bn). But, at the same time, the government is talking about supporting renewable energy as part of the recovery. Renewables have the economic edge in India, offering far cheaper electricity than coal Renewables have the economic edge in India, offering far cheaper electricity than coal. The report claims that new solar capacity can cost as little 2.55 rupees per kilowatt hour, while the average cost for electricity generated from coal is 3.38 rupees per hour. Investing in renewables is also consistent with the country's National Clean Air Programme, launched in 2019. Environmentalists hope the clean air and clear skies Indians have enjoyed since lockdown will increase public pressure on the government to clean up the power sector and improve air quality.

But even before India's sudden coronavirus lockdown, the demand for coal was weakening. The study finds that in the fiscal year ending March 2020, coal deliveries were down by around 2%, a small but significant reduction when set against the trend - an increase in thermal power generation of 7.5% a year set over the previous decade. Indian oil consumption shows a similar reduction in demand growth. The nationwide lockdown finally tipped a 37-year emissions growth trend into reverse It has been slowing since early 2019. And, once again, the trend has been compounded by the impact of the Covid-19 lockdown measures on the transport industry. India's double first in climate battle How India's 'smart villages' are centralising solar power Why power theft in India is a complex problem Oil consumption was down 18% year-on-year in March 2020. Meanwhile, the supply of energy from renewables has increased over the year and has held up since the pandemic struck. This resilience the renewables energy sector shows in the face of the sudden reduction in demand caused by coronavirus is not confined to India. This video can not be played Delhi smog disappears during India's lockdown According to figures published by the International Energy Agency (IEA) at the end of April, the world's use of coal was down 8% in the first quarter of the year. By contrast, wind and solar power saw a slight uptick in demand internationally. A key reason that coal has taken the brunt of the fall in electricity demand is that it cost more to run on a day-to-day basis. Once you have installed a solar panel or a wind turbine, operating costs are very low and, therefore, tend to get priority on electricity grids. India's use of coal has plummeted, in line with that of other countries Thermal power stations - those powered by coal, gas or oil - by contrast, require you to buy fuel in order to generate power. But analysts warn that the decline in fossil fuel use may not last. They say when the pandemic subsides, there is a risk that emissions will soar again as countries attempt to kick-start their economies. The US has already started to relax environmental regulations and the fear is other nations could follow suit. However, the analysis from Carbon Brief suggests there are reasons to think India could buck this trend. The coronavirus crisis has brought the long-brewing financial troubles in the Indian coal sector to a head, and the Indian government is finalising a relief package which could top 900bn rupees ($12bn; Â£9.6bn). But, at the same time, the government is talking about supporting renewable energy as part of the recovery. Renewables have the economic edge in India, offering far cheaper electricity than coal Renewables have the economic edge in India, offering far cheaper electricity than coal. The report claims that new solar capacity can cost as little 2.55 rupees per kilowatt hour, while the average cost for electricity generated from coal is 3.38 rupees per hour. Investing in renewables is also consistent with the country's National Clean Air Programme, launched in 2019. Environmentalists hope the clean air and clear skies Indians have enjoyed since lockdown will increase public pressure on the government to clean up the power sector and improve air quality.

"This video can not be played Matt Hancock: ""Unlikely that big, lavish international holidays are going to possible for this summer"" Many British people are unlikely to be able to take foreign holidays this summer because of coronavirus, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said. He told ITV's This Morning it's ""likely to be the case"" there won't be a normal summer holiday season. The government is opening up parts of the economy, and Ryanair is planning to start services in July. But Mr Hancock said the traditional big-break holiday season is unlikely. Social distancing will have to be maintained for some time, he said. ""The conclusion from that is it is unlikely that big, lavish international holidays are going to be possible for this summer."" What are the new travel quarantine rules? How will transport need to change? Mr Hancock's comments came as many airlines detailed plans to restart flights. Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary, who last month said that leaving the middle seat free to help social distancing was ""idiotic"", said he planned to sell as many seats as possible this summer. The airline is planning to operate nearly 1,000 flights a day from July, up from 30 today. It said face coverings being worn by all crew and passengers and cashless on-board transactions would help keep passengers safe as well as a new system for toilet breaks. Passengers will haveto ask crew to use the toiletto stop queues forming. Meanwhile, EasyJet has told the BBC that it does not have a date for restarting flights, but is keeping the situation under review. The announcement came despite government plans to introducea 14-day quarantine for international travellersto prevent a second spike in the virus, infuriating airlines which planned to resume flying in the coming months. Willie Walsh, boss of rival firm IAG, which owns British Airways, criticised the move, warning it would force him to review his plans to ramp up flights in the summer. ""There's nothing positive in anything I heard the prime minister say [on Sunday],"" he told MPs. Virgin Atlantic also released its summer schedule for 2021 on Tuesday, promising more flights to Tel Aviv as well as routes linking Florida with Manchester, Glasgow, London Heathrow and Belfast after it pulled out of Gatwick. Scenes that are unlikely to be seen this summer John and Irene Hays, owners of travel company Hays Travel,which took over Thomas Cook's shops last year, said the news has not dampened people's enthusiasm to get away. Mr Hay told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""There is a real desire to go on holiday. People have been locked down, and in terms of new bookings we're getting strong demand."" Talking about trips which were booked earlier in the year, Mrs Hays added: ""Many people are not cancelling, they are just deferring their holiday or in some cases holding on to a credit note for now."" Mr Hays also thought that having to self-isolate at home for 14 days after returning from abroad may not stop people travelling. ""If people in the UK are already in lockdown, they might be happy to spend another fortnight at home. Some people might say go to Spain or somewhere, have a nice holiday and then come back and continue their lockdown,"" he said. Mr Hancock's comments echo those from Transport Secretary Grant Shapps last month who warned people not to book summer holidays - domestic and overseas - until social distancing rules are relaxed. ""I won't be booking a summer holiday at this point,"" he told the BBC on 17 April. Airlines, and the travel industry generally, have been among the biggest financial losers of the international lockdown. Aircraft fleets have been grounded and thousands of job cuts announced, withBritish Airways shedding 12,000  jobsandVirgin 3,000 jobs. LOCKDOWN UPDATE:What's changing, where?

"The first step includes changes to rules on exercise and allowing churches to open for private prayer A five-stage plan for easing the Covid-19 lockdown in Northern Ireland has been published by the executive. Unlike plans announced inEngland,externaland theRepublic of Ireland, NI's blueprint does not include a timetable - but the first minister said she hoped to reach the final stage by December. Progression will depend on key health criteria being met, Arlene Foster said. The first step includes changes to rules on exercise and churches being able to open for private prayer. It comes as a further nine deaths were recorded by the Department of Health on Tuesday, although only one had occurred within the past 24 hours. The document, entitledExecutive Approach to Decision-Making,external, was outlined by Mrs Foster and Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill in the Stormont Assembly. In the first stage, groups of four to six people who do not share a household would be allowed to meet outdoors while maintaining social distancing. Large outdoor-based retailers such as garden centres will also be allowed to reopen in this first phase, as life slowly edges its way back towards normality. However, the plan stresses that aspects of some steps may not take effect at the same time. Movement between stages of the Pathway to Recovery would depend on progress in reducing the transmission of the virus, said Mrs Foster. ""We will not be driven by a timetable and we know some will be disappointed by that - but our roadmap doesn't answer every query, it provides people with an indication of how things might move in the weeks and months ahead."" Ms O'Neill appealed to the public to ""be patient"". ""When we're in position to slowly and carefully move out of the lockdown, we will keep you updated every step of the way,"" she added. ""It's not in the too-distant future, if people keep following the advice."" Some business leaders in Northern Ireland have expressed disappointment that indicative timings have not been included in the plan, with Chief Executive of the Belfast Chamber of Commerce, Simon Hamilton, sayinga timetable was needed in order for firms to plan,externalproperly. But Mrs Foster said the ""sad truth"" was that some businesses in Northern Ireland would not survive. ""It's right we're honest about that,"" she told the assembly. ""What we have to do is to try and make sure the maximum number of businesses survive and that has always been what has driven the executive in terms of their economic interventions, put alongside Westminster government interventions."" Chancellor Rishi Sunak has announced that the UK scheme to pay workers on leave because of the lockdownwill be extended to October. While a path out of the lockdown has been laid out, the 'Stay at Home' message remains in place Northern Ireland has its own powers to set and lift restrictions at different rates to the rest of the UK. The executive must review its coronavirus regulations every three weeks, with the next due by 28 May. In some reviews, no changes may be recommended, but a flexible approach will mean each review stage does not have to be tied to the next step of relaxations. The plan says the executive will only relax restrictions in line with the long-term interest of people's health and wellbeing. Step one: Encouragement to those unable to work from home to return to work on a phased basis Large outdoor-based retail can open including garden centres, though associated cafes and restaurants can only offer takeaway or collection Groups of four to six people who do not share a household can meet outdoors maintaining social distancing. With the exception of people who are shielding, visits to immediate family allowed indoors where social distancing is possible Drive-through church services and churches open for private prayer, with appropriate social distancing and cleaning of shared contact hard surfaces Outdoor spaces and public sport amenities to open. For example, walking, running, cycling, some water activities, golf, tennis Drive-through cinemas can open Step two: Non-food retail can open where numbers are limited, with social distancing Groups of up to 10 can meet outdoors As demand increases on public transport within social distancing requirements, people encouraged to walk and cycle for short journeys where possible Resumption of, for example, team sports training on a non-contact basis in small groups Selected libraries reopen with restricted services Open-air museums reopen Step three: Phased return to office and onsite working subject to risk assessment. Work that can be done from home should still be done from home Schools expand provision for priority groups on a part-time basis, using a combination of in-school and remote learning Gatherings can accommodate up to 30 people while maintaining social distancing Resumption of, for example, team sports training on a non-contact basis Museums and galleries open Libraries open Concert and theatre rehearsals resume Step four: Other ""contact"" retail (hairdressers, fitness studios, tattoo and piercing parlours) can open subject to mitigations following risk assessment Schools expand provision to accommodate all pupils on part-time basis with combination of in-school and remote learning Reducing and staggering demand for public transport at peak times through continued home working and staggered start times for businesses Wider range of gatherings permitted including church services subject to social distancing and other suitable mitigations, such as cleaning of hard surfaces Resumption of competitive sport ""behind closed doors"" or with limitations on the number of spectators Leisure centres and other indoor leisure facilities open Outdoor concerts on restricted basis Step five: All able to return to work subject to mitigations. Remote working still strongly encouraged Hospitality retail (restaurants, cafes, pubs) can open subject to risk assessment, initially on a limited basis Expand early-year school provision to full-time basis Public transport operating full service but subject to ongoing risk assessment People can meet in extended groups subject to social distancing Resumption of close physical contact sports Return to competitive sport and full use of sporting facilities Spectators can attend live events on restricted basis Nightclubs, concerts open on a limited basis Read the full document,external How do lockdown rules differ in Northern Ireland? The focus on a recovery plan comes as 447 Covid-19 related deaths,mostly comprising hospital fatalities, have been reported by Northern Ireland's Department of Health so far. However, that figure is likely to be higher when all fatalities in the community are recorded. A further nine deaths were recorded by the department on Tuesday, only one had occurred within the past 24 hours. There have been 4,193 positive cases of the virus in NI, with 44 new cases confirmed by Tuesday. Across the UK, the death toll currently stands at 32,692 while in the Republic of Ireland, 1,488 people have died. As the infection has spread at different rates in various parts of the UK, Stormont ministers have said Northern Ireland must follow its own criteria and scientific advice. The R-value - or reproduction number- is at the heart of the executive's decision to extend the lockdown until at least the end of May. R refers to the average number of people that someone with Covid-19 is expected to infect after contracting the virus. The goal is to keep R under one. On Tuesday Arlene Foster told the executive's daily press conference that Northern Ireland's R-rate is sitting below one, at 0.79, but that it must fall as low as possible before restrictions can begin to be lifted. If the number drops to a suitable level before the restrictions are next due to be reviewed, ministers hope to trigger the first step of the plan sooner, added Michelle O'Neill. The executive will assess the figure on a ""daily"" basis, but a wider programme of testing and tracing will accompany any decisions around easing restrictions. Contact tracing aims to identify and alert people who have come into contact with a person infected with coronavirus. It largely stopped in the UK on 12 March, as the government moved into a different stage of its response to the virus, but apilot programme recommenced in NIlast month. Mrs Foster said this was now set to be extended from 18 May. The benefit of this approach is that the Executive will not tie itself down or have to engage in any difficult retreats in previously stated policies. Stormont ministers point to other countries around the world which have appeared to make great progress in curbing the virus, but have more recently experienced flare ups and had to re-impose controls. However, maximum flexibility for Stormont equals maximum uncertainty for wider society. Maybe that's just the reality in these challenging times. In future weeks ,we shall all be trying to become increasingly well versed with the R-number, which measures the spread of the virus. But ministers will know that their five-step approach will also be judged alongside the different five-point plans already laid out by Dublin and London, which will influence the context in which people comply with the coronavirus regulations in the months ahead.

"Harry Dunn died in hospital after his motorbike was involved in a crash outside RAF Croughton The US has said its decision to refuse an extradition request for Harry Dunn's alleged killer was final. It comes after an Interpol Red Notice was issued for US national Anne Sacoolas who is now""wanted internationally"". A US official said she had diplomatic immunity, but Downing Street branded the refusal ""a denial of justice"". Mr Dunn, 19, died after a crash in Northamptonshire, with Mrs Sacoolas accused of death by dangerous driving. The shadow foreign secretary has accused the Foreign Office of ""clear and repeated failings"". Mrs Sacoolas, the wife of a US intelligence official based at RAF Croughton, claimed diplomatic immunity following the crash and was able to return to her home country, sparking an international outcry. The Interpol Red notice means she can be arrested if she leaves the US. Mr Dunn's mother Charlotte Charles was notified by Northamptonshire Police about the Interpol notice. She said it was ""a huge step in the right direction"". Anne Sacoolas, pictured on her wedding day in 2003, cited diplomatic immunity after the crash outside RAF Croughton Motorcyclist Mr Dunn died in a crash with a car near US military base RAF Croughton on 27 August. A Home Office extradition request was refused by US secretary of state Mike Pompeo in January. On Tuesday, the state department's spokeswoman said that decision was final. She said that granting the extradition request for Mrs Sacoolas would have rendered the invocation of diplomatic immunity a practical nullity and would have set an ""extraordinarily troubling precedent"". She added that the US has a history of close law enforcement co-operation with the UK, and values that relationship. But the Prime Minister's official spokesman said Boris Johnson ""has been clear that he wants to see justice served for Harry and his family"". Mr Johnson had raised the case with Donald Trump ""on a number of occasions"", the spokesman said. ""The US refusal to extradite Anne Sacoolas amounts to a denial of justice and she should return to the UK,"" the spokesman added. Shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy has called for a parliamentary inquiry, in which the Foreign Secretary would have to explain ""failings"" with Mr Dunn's case. Road side banner supporting justice for Harry Dunn But the Dunn family spokesman Radd Seiger said: ""The White House may feel that secretary Pompeo's refusal to extradite Anne Sacoolas was final but that does not reflect the real position. ""In fact quite the contrary, as the US Embassy in London said in a recent letter to Andrea Leadsom, both countries recognise that the final decision will rest with the court following a judicial review."" An Interpol Red Notice is a request to law enforcement worldwide to locate and provisionally arrest a person pending extradition, surrender, or similar legal action.

"Social distancing measures being trialled on the number 24 bus in Bristol Bus operators face a challenge to restore services for returning workers amid union claims lockdown easing plans had caused ""chaos and panic"". With fewer passengers allowed on each bus and the government encouraging people to avoid public transport, firms say fares will not cover their costs. Unions are also concerned about safety amid reports ofhigher death rates linked to Covid-19 among male drivers. The government says it will work with bus operators. The Confederation of Passenger Transport UK (CPT) said bus operators were running about 40% of their services for about 10% of the passengers they would expect at this time of year. Bristol bus operator First West of England is running two buses in tandem on some peak routes to boost seat numbers while social distancing is in place, according to theLocal Democracy Reporting Service. Boss James Freeman: ""We've tried to reorganise the business to face the challenge of how we protect people from coronavirus at the same time as providing a minimum level of service for the people who need to travel. ""They are essential workers who haven't got any other form of transport. There aren't that many - patronage is down to about 8%. ""Buses are still running from first thing in the morning to late at night. Most are completely empty. It's turned our world upside down."" A total of 26 bus workers in London have died from Covid-19 so far Social distancing would differ depending on the layout of buses, but might typically involve passengers only sitting in window seats with a row's gap between them, the CPT said. In that scenario, ""farebox revenue would not be enough to cover the industry's costs"", the CPT said, and it would ""need some form of investment from central government to make that work"". First West said it was trialling signs to advise passengers on where to sit and will be taping off some areas - steps that limit the number of passengers buses can carry. Mr Freeman said: ""There are 20 seats on a double decker. That should reassure people there won't be someone sitting behind them, breathing down their neck."" Transport for London (TfL) said the requirement to keep 2m social distancing wherever possible meant the bus network would only be able to carry around 13-15% of the normal number of passengers even when all services were operating again. Its advice to passengers who cannot avoid using public transport is to travel outside of peak times, wear a face ""covering"", carry a hand sanitiser and wash hands before and after travel. Transport Salaried Staffs' Association (TSSA) union general secretary Manuel Cortes said Prime Minister Boris Johnson's announcement on Sunday to ""actively encourage"" people to return to work, but discouraging the use of public transport had caused ""chaos and panic"". ""Frankly, it's dangerous and will put the lives of bus drivers, and all public transport workers, at risk,"" he said. London bus driver Johnie MeHarry is a senior shop steward for his branch of the Unite union. Though he has been driving throughout the pandemic, he says he has only just been issued with a face mask. Mr MeHarry says he limits his chance of infection by driving with the window open and washing his hands regularly. ""Drivers are worried it's going to be overcrowded,"" the father-of-two, 39, said. ""It's already happening on a lot of routes. ""The more people there is on the bus, the more risk there is of contamination. ""What we are calling for is a fully-sealed-off cab,"" he said. ""TfL is working on this, but it won't be in place for tomorrow when this increase is going to happen."" Mr MeHarry said central London routes had been quiet during the lockdown, though he expects that to change over the coming weeks. Despite his fears, Mr MeHarry said he was still proud to be keeping the health workforce moving. Mike Brown, London's transport commissioner, said: ""Our intention is to progressively build up service levels to as close to pre-pandemic levels as possible, but it is clear life simply won't be swiftly returning to what it was before. ""The travel demand challenge facing us outstrips that faced during the 2012 games due to the national requirement to maintain 2m distance between passengers wherever possible."" First West's Mr Freeman said: ""With the number of the passengers dropping, they have taken a large chunk of revenue. Most costs are being met from the public purse. ""When the lockdown is relaxed we're expecting to be asked to put on as much as 80% of the service back on. It can only be done if central government is willing to pay."" Robert Williams, the chief executive of Reading Buses, said: ""There is a balance of need between domestic and economic necessities and minimising the transmission of the virus. ""We wouldn't be providing services if we felt it was fundamentally unsafe, but we also can't run services at a loss."" LOCKDOWN UPDATE:What's changing, where?

BBC Four has shared a video telling the story of the thousands of Caribbean and African women who answered the call 70 years ago to come to the UK to save the then ailing health service. It's a tale of a struggle to overcome racism, their fight for career progression and their battle for national recognition. The video is part of a documentary which aired on the channel in September.

"Oil and Gas UK (OGUK) wants action from the UK government to allow businesses in its sector to access finance to help them through the Covid-19 crisis Claims by oil and gas companies that they are curbing their carbon emissions in line with net zero targets are overstated, according to a new review. The independent analysis of six large European corporations acknowledges they have taken big steps on CO2 recently. In April, Shell became the latest to announce ambitious plans to be at net zero for operational emissions by 2050. But the authors say none of the companies are yet aligned with the 1.5C temperature goal. Scientists argue that the global temperature must not rise by more than 1.5C by the end of the century if  the world is to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. Can coronavirus crisis spur a green recovery? BP profits dive 66% as coronavirus hits oil demand Shell cuts dividend for first time since WW2 Don't forget 'deeper emergency', says UN chief The research has been carried out by theTransition Pathway Initiative,external(TPI), an investor-led group which investigates how companies are preparing for the move to a low-carbon economy. Goingâ¯net zeroâ¯means removing as many emissions as are produced. TPI found that the relationship between the oil and gas industry and climate change has evolved rapidly over the last three years. In Europe, in 2017, no European company had set targets to reduce the carbon intensity of the energy it supplied. Today, all six companies assessed by the analysis have targets and plans. Over the last six months, say the authors of the report, climate ambitions among these companies have risen markedly. In February,the new head of BP, Bernard Looney, committed to cutting net carbon emissions to zero by 2050 or sooner. Going further than his predecessor, Mr Looney said BP would cut the emissions intensity of its sold products by 50% by the middle of this century. But according to this new analysis, BP and Austrian company OMV are the only two oil and gas companies of the six assessed who have failed to align with the pledges made under the Paris climate agreement. ""Is it sufficient? No, it's not,"" said Adam Matthews, co-chair of TPI. ""There are ones that have more comprehensive commitments that put them on a path much closer to two degrees than some of the others."" Shell is classed as the most ambitious of the companies assessed and are the closest to a 2C warming scenario. However, despite Shell'sstated commitment,externalto having a net-zero energy business by 2050, TPI says that ""the claim that it will be aligned with a 1.5C climate scenario is not consistent with our analysis."" The authors say that they have not been able to assess Shell's plan to sell only its energy products to companies that are committed to net zero. Climate protestors have mounted actions against the major oil companies ""We can't yet quantify that,"" said Adam Matthews. ""But that potentially is very significant. And does get them to a sort of one and a half degree of warming kind of commitment, which is equivalent to net zero."" According to the authors, a genuine net zero strategy for the average European oil and gas company would require 100% emissions cuts between now and 2050. TPI point out that all of the plans they have assessed are, to some degree, dependent on carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology and nature-based solutions such as planting trees. ""There are very significant assumptions that need further probing,"" said Adam Matthews. ""And we obviously need greater understanding of the role that that these will play in delivering these strategies."" Four of the companies assessed, Shell, Eni, Total and Repsol, are now aligned with the pledges made under the Paris climate agreement. However, the authors draw a sharp contrast between the actions of these European companies and oil and gas producers in the US. None of the dozens of American fossil fuel corporations have public disclosures on climate change comparable to Europe, which TPI says is a concern. ""We simply don't know what their intentions are on this issue, that poses a greater financial risk to us,"" said Adam Matthews. ""We're continuing to engage, but engagements are finite, there comes a point at which you have to draw very clear conclusions.""

"The executive has already extended lockdown in NI until 28 May The executive intends to publish a five-stage plan on Tuesday that will set out a slow easing of NI's lockdown. Ministers have been discussing a blueprint, which will not include projected dates, for lifting some restrictions. Setting ""arbitrary timeframes"" would be unhelpful, said junior minister Declan Kearney. Downing Street haspublished a conditional plan to ease lockdown,external, but it mostly applies only in England. Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales have their own powers to set and lift restrictions at different rates. Speaking at the executive's daily press conference, Sinn FÃ©in's Mr Kearney said discussions on Monday had been detailed and positive, but ""further work is needed in the next 24 hours"". If the plan is signed off by the executive, the first and deputy first ministers are expected to bring it to the assembly on Tuesday for debate. The focus on a recovery plan comes asthree more Covid-19 related deaths have been recorded,externalby the Department of Health in Northern Ireland, taking its total, mostly comprising of hospital deaths, to 438. However, that figure is likely to be higher when all fatalities in the community are recorded. Ministers have said that unlike in England, where Boris Johnson has placed projected dates next to different phases of easing the lockdown, that will not happen in Northern Ireland. ""At any given moment in time we will be operating a staged approach with a three-weekly interval,"" said Mr Kearney. Executive ministers have said people in Northern Ireland should still stay at home as much as possible The executive wants ""sufficient flexibility"" to allow it to make modifications in line with scientific advice, as opposed to setting targeted dates that may need to be pushed back if there is another spike in cases. There will likely only be ""minor changes"" announced by the executive to take effect this week, on issues such as outdoor exercise and potentially some churches being allowed to facilitate individual prayer. Each step will be ""incremental and cautious"", said DUP junior minister Gordon Lyons. ""Social distancing is going to be with us for a very long time. ""Just as it has become a reality of how we shop, it will be a reality of how we work together, study together, socialise and even how we worship - it would be a grave mistake to assume we have beaten Covid-19."" Aphased return of schools is not likely until September. The executive is aware that while its own roadmap may differ from that announced by Downing Street, Northern Ireland is still reliant on Westminster for some financial support. Manybusinesses in NI have availed of the government's furlough scheme, allowing employers to temporarily lay off staff while the government pays 80% of their wages during the crisis. As the infection has spread at different rates in various parts of the UK, Stormont ministers have said Northern Ireland must follow its own criteria and scientific advice. The R-value - or reproduction number- is at the heart of the executive's decision to extend the lockdown until at least the end of May. The R-number shows how many people will get infected for every one person who gets ill. In Northern Ireland, the R-rate is sitting just below one, at 0.8-0.9, and the executive has said it must remain at a low level before restrictions can begin to be lifted. Ministers have already extended the lockdown until 28 May, so the earliest the recovery plan could take effect from would be the beginning of June. In England, fines for breaking lockdown rules will increase to Â£100 from Wednesday - but the executive has not yet decided if it will follow this approach. The Irish government hasalready announced a detailed planfor bringing the Republic of Ireland slowly out of lockdown. It also has five stages, with the first beginning on 18 May and the last phase by 10 August, if the spread of the virus is contained. The promenade in Blackrock, County Louth, which is close to the Irish border Phase one includes the reopening of golf courses on a restricted basis, and outdoor meetings between people from different households. There are questions about how the Republic of Ireland's plan fits with what the NI Executive will announce. The two jurisdictions share a 310-mile long border which people cross each day for work or leisure. At the beginning of the lockdown, it emerged that gardaÃ­ (Irish police)had been informed they had no enforcement powersover people from Northern Ireland, who may have breached Covid-19 regulations in the Republic of Ireland. There have been calls for testing to be increased further across Northern Ireland Northern Ireland has been working to increase its testing capacity sincethe first case of the virus was confirmedin February. Health officials say capacity has grown from 40 tests a day, to more than 2,000 tests now, withanother laboratory due to start workthis week. However, testing remains limited to people who are being admitted to hospital, live in care homes or are essential workers. In care homes, wherealmost half of Covid-19 deaths have been recordedso far, residents and staff are only tested where there is a suspected outbreak, or if they are new entrants to the care home sector. It is not clear when the Executive intends to move to wider testing within the community. There is a considerable difference in the death tolls in the two sets of figures published in Northern Ireland. While the Northern Ireland Statistical Research Agency recorded 516 deaths by 1 May, the Department of Health - which records deaths of patients who tested positive for coronavirus, and therefore mostly died in hospital - had recorded365 deathsby the same date. Nisra's toll is 35% higher because its weekly bulletin, released each Friday, records all fatalities with Covid-19 mentioned on the death certificate, regardless of where the individual died and whether or not they had been tested for the virus. So although the health department confirmed three more deaths on Sunday, taking its toll to 438, the overall death toll will be significantly higher. The disparity between the two sets of figures has caused confusion, but the department said there was always a time lag for registering deaths in the community - which can take five days - so Nisra's report could not feasibly be linked to the daily figures. Nisra's report on Friday showed there were 27 patients in intensive care with Covid-19 symptoms, compared to 58 a month ago. Although comparisons between countries and regions are difficult due to differences in how statistics are compiled, Northern Ireland's death rate (27 per 100,000 of the population) is similar to that of the Republic of Ireland (29 per 100,000) and significantly lower than that of Great Britain (43 per 100,000). A further 210 coronavirus-related deaths were confirmed across the UK on Monday, taking the total to 32,065. The Republic of Ireland announced a further 12 deaths on Sunday, bringing its overall death toll to 1,458. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

"This video can not be played ""Huge deficit"" in intensive care doctors More intensive care doctors need to be trained in Wales to address a ""huge deficit"", a senior medic has warned. Jack Parry-Jones said most of Wales' intensive care units were short of doctors before the coronavirus pandemic struck. He called for more training places for intensive care doctors and for the units themselves to be upgraded. The NHS body responsible for training said there had been a ""sustainable increase"" in training places. A Welsh Government spokesman said: ""We are committed to improving critical care capacity across Wales. ""The health minister set out a programme for improving critical care, including Â£15m of funding. We have also featured critical care as part of ourTrain Work Live,externalcampaign."" Jack Parry-Jones said other health boards needed the same investment in critical care units as the Aneurin Bevan board was making at the new Grange University Hospital Dr Parry-Jones, who is an intensive care consultant in south Wales and a board member of the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine, said units were staffed by doctors who were not necessarily specialists in intensive care medicine. ""Most units are short of intensive care medicine doctors, and that would be from consultants all the way through to juniors. ""But the important thing really is that 50% of intensive care posts are not properly filled. And by that I mean that most intensive care units in Wales still require the intensive care consultant rota to be covered at some point by people who aren't intensive care medicine trained."" He said they tended to be anaesthetic consultants who ""cross-covered"" into intensive care, as opposed to fully-trained intensive medicine consultants. Wales 'uniquely at risk' with lack of ICU beds 'Wales needs more intensive care staff to cope' Behind the scenes on the intensive care front line The organisation responsible for training doctors, Health Education and Improvement Wales (HEIW), said there had been a ""planned, sustainable increase"" in training places in recent years. Pushpinder Mangat, HEIW medical director and a former intensive care consultant, said: ""Since 2017 we have increased the number of permanent higher speciality intensive care training posts in Wales by 58%. ""We have continued this plan with new posts for this year's intake and plan to include further posts next year."" He said they had also increased the number of internal medicine training posts, meaning every year an extra 39 trainee doctors would work and gain experience in Welsh intensive care units. But Dr Parry-Jones said while the number of trainees had increased there was still a significant shortfall. ""There's a huge deficit because we have a deficit anyway, and then obviously we have consultants retiring all the time. And there's a constant fill-rate that needs to go on just to maintain the status quo."" He said there would eventually be ""limits"" to how many trainees could be taken on, but that was not the case at the moment. During the coronavirus pandemic, extra ""surge capacity"" beds have been made available in hospitals to cope with the potential numbers of critically ill patients, on a temporary basis. Conservative health spokeswoman in the Senedd Angela Burns said shortfalls across the NHS needed to be addressed for it to cope with the pressures it faces. Ms Burns said: ""With sadness I think this pandemic is not going to be the only time we are under this kind of pressure. So we have to absolutely make sure we can ramp up the resources we need."" Can you compare Covid-19 in different countries? 'Real focus' urged on transmission rate She said expanding capacity to cope with the pressure meant the right staff needed to be recruited. ""These people take an awfully long time to train because they are highly specialised. Getting the bed is one thing, getting the right calibre of people to staff it is completely different."" Dr Parry-Jones said the units themselves needed upgrading to match the standard that would open at the new Grange University Hospital near Cwmbran next year, which will have 30 intensive care beds, all of them isolated. ""We've been trying to do the increase [in training posts] for many, many years. For 10 to 15 years we've been asking for an increase. I think the Welsh Government really picked up and started listening to this about two years ago now."" He said Cardiff had far too few isolation facilities and that investment was needed ""to bring it into the 21st Century.""

"This video can not be played ""Employers will not be allowed to get away with forcing people to work in conditions that are not Covid-secure"" A ""sudden big flood"" of people returning to work is not expected after the release of new coronavirus guidance, Boris Johnson has said. The PM said measures, including encouraging people in England to return to work if safe, were ""baby steps"". He also said employers should be sympathetic to workers who do not have access to childcare. It came as new rules said people in England can soon meet one person from outside their household, at a distance. From Wednesday, people can socialise in open spaces or play one-to-one sport such as tennis with another person, as long as they stay 2m apart. Mr Johnson used Monday's daily Downing Street briefing to clarify hisreturn to work message,saying employers would need to prove they met a new safety standard, dubbed ""Covid secure"". He said: ""I don't think any of us expect that tomorrow or for the rest of this week there is going to be a sudden big flood of people back to work. ""I think a lot of people will now start to think whether they fall into that category, whether they could think about going back to work."" He told people in England their workplaces ""must be safe, must be Covid secure and employers will not be allowed to get away with forcing people to work in conditions that are not Covid secure"". ""Everyone must obey social distancing and we're going to have a lot more inspections by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), we'll have a random spot inspections to check that companies are doing the right thing,"" he said. ""If people find themselves in conditions that they think are unsafe, then they should immediately report it and we will take action, and that goes for all work."" It comes as a further 210 people have died in the UK after testing positive for coronavirus,taking the total number of deaths recorded to 32,065,external. After eight days of missing its goal of 100,000 tests a day, on Monday the government counted 100,490 tests on 10 May. Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK government's chief scientific adviser, told the Downing Street briefing that Office for National Statistics data suggests an estimated 136,000 people were currently infected with coronavirus in the UK. He said the amount of time it may take for this number to halve is around two weeks on current infection rates. LOCKDOWN UPDATE:What's changing, where? SCHOOLS:When will children be returning? EXERCISE:What are the guidelines on getting out? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters Earlier, the government published newguidance for the public,external, as well asa lengthy strategy document,external, on the next steps in its coronavirus response in England. The information includes new advice for people in England to wear face coverings while on public transport and in some shops. It also set out how, from Wednesday, people in England will be allowed to meet one person from outside their household as long as they stay outdoors and stay 2m apart. Sage, the government's group of scientific advisers, said the risk of infection outside is significantly lower than inside, according to the strategy document. Mr Johnson told Parliament the public should exercise ""good, solid, British common sense"" in adapting their lives to the next phase of the coronavirus response. Scotland: Non-essential trips 'could break law' NI: Plan to ease lockdown 'over five stages' Wales: 'Do not drive from England to exercise' But Mr Johnson defended the differing approaches between the UK nations after leaders in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland said ""stay at home"" messages remained in place there. ""For those who think that the 'stay alert' is not the right message, I think it is absolutely the right message for our country now,"" he said. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland all have devolved powers over their own lockdown restrictions. It comes as the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy releasednew guidance for UK employers,externalon how to implement social distancing measures, with eight separate documents published for sectors which can now reopen. What are the new rules? Who am I allowed to meet now? How to make your own face mask The HSE has been given Â£14m in funding for extra call-centre workers, inspectors and equipment. The guidance for employers says they could be Covid secure by re-designing workplaces with 2 metre (6ft) distances in mind, staggering start times, building one-way systems and publishing detailed risk assessments. The Trades Union Congress said the new guidelines were ""a step in the right direction"". Meanwhile, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer used an official response to the PM's coronavirus address on Sunday to urge further clarity and reassurance for workers and parents that returning to work and school would be safe. This video can not be played In a recorded statement, Sir Keir Starmer said the UK couldn't ""go back to business as usual"" after coronavirus The new guidance said the government's ambition was for all primary school children in England to return to school for a month before the summer. Childminders in England will also be permitted to look after children again. Fresh guidance published for primary schools on Monday nightsaid class sizes should be limited to 15and drop-off and pick-up times staggered when they are able to return. Asked during the Downing Street briefing what people should do in the meantime if they do not have access to childcare and cannot work from home, Mr Johnson said he was sure employers would be understanding. ""If people don't have access to childcare and they have a child who isn't back in school then I think that's only fair to regard that as an obvious barrier to their ability to go back to work and I am sure employers will agree with that,"" he said. The PM told Parliament the government's ""roadmap"" would help control Covid-19 Meanwhile, the guidance confirmed garden centres will also be able to reopen on Wednesday with distancing measures in place. It is likely that the government will continue to advise people who are clinically extremely vulnerable to continue to shield beyond June, the strategy document added. The 60-page document also said: People in England can drive to any outdoor open space in the country - but not to other UK nations whose rules should be respected Healthy people aged 70 and over should take particular care to minimise contact with others - even if they have not been advised to shield by the NHS Clothes should be washed regularly if people work with others outside of their household Doors and windows should be left open in places where people from different households interact A ""rapid re-engineering of government's structures and institutions"" is needed to deal with Covid-19 Fines for those who do not follow the rules in Englandwill increase from Â£60 to Â£100 from Wednesday, with maximum total penalties for repeat offenders of Â£3,200. Speaking about potential future measures, Mr Johnson told MPs the government was exploring how to safely allow people to expand their household to include one other ""on a strictly reciprocal basis"". The new guidance also reflected the government's three-step plan, announced by the PM on Sunday night. CORONAVIRUS QUIZ:Fact or fiction?
