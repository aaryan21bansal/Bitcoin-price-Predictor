"Liverpool FC topped the list of Premier League club names used as passwords Millions of people are using easy-to-guess passwords on sensitive accounts, suggests a study. The analysis by the UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) found 123456 was the most widely-used password on breached accounts. The study helped to uncover the gaps in cyber-knowledge that could leave people in danger of being exploited. The NCSC said people should string three random but memorable words together to use as a strong password. For its first cyber-survey, the NCSC analysed public databases of breached accounts to see which words, phrases and strings people used. Top of the list was 123456, appearing in more than 23 million passwords. The second-most popular string, 123456789, was not much harder to crack, while others in the top five included ""qwerty"", ""password"" and 1111111. The most common name to be used in passwords was Ashley, followed by Michael, Daniel, Jessica and Charlie. When it comes to Premier League football teams in guessable passwords, Liverpool are champions and Chelsea are second. Blink-182 topped the charts of music acts. People who use well-known words or names for a password put themselves people at risk of being hacked, said Dr Ian Levy, technical director of the NCSC. ""Nobody should protect sensitive data with something that can be guessed, like their first name, local football team or favourite band,"" he said. The NCSC study also quizzed people about their security habits and fears. It found that 42% expected to lose money to online fraud and only 15% said they felt confident that they knew enough to protect themselves online. It found that fewer than half of those questioned used a separate, hard-to-guess password for their main email account. Security expert Troy Hunt, who maintains a database of hacked account data, said picking a good password was the ""single biggest control"" people had over their online security. ""We typically haven't done a very good job of that either as individuals or as the organisations asking us to register with them,"" he said. Letting people know which passwords were widely used should drive users to make better choices, he said. The survey was published ahead of the NCSC's Cyber UK conference that will be held in Glasgow from 24-25 April.

"Seven-year-old Leia Armitage lived in total silence for the first two years of her life, but thanks to pioneering brain surgery and years of therapy she has found her voice and can finally tell her parents she loves them. ""We were told you could put a bomb behind her and she wouldn't hear it at all if it went off,"" said Leia's father, Bob, as he recalled finding out their baby daughter had a rare form of profound deafness. Leia, from Dagenham in east London, had no inner ear or hearing nerve, meaning that even standard hearing aids or cochlear implants wouldn't help her. As a result, she was never expected to speak - but despite the risks, her parents fought for her to be one of the first children in the UK to be given an auditory brainstem implant, requiring complex brain surgery when she was two years old. NHS England calls the surgery ""truly life-changing"" and has said it will fund the implant for other deaf children in a similar position. It is estimated that about 15 children a year will be assessed for the procedure and nine will go on to have surgery. Bob says opting for this type of brain surgery was a huge decision for them, but ""we wanted to give Leia the best opportunity in life"". He and his wife Alison hoped that after the surgery at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust she would be able to hear things like cars beeping their horns as she crossed the road - to make her safer in the world. However, in the five years since the surgery, her progress has been much greater than they ever expected. Leia with her parents, Bob and Alison, and brother Jacob It started slowly, with Leia turning her head at the sound of train doors closing shortly after the operation. Gradually, she started to understand the concept of sound while her parents continually repeated words, asking her to mimic the sound. Now, after lots of regular speech and language therapy, she can put full sentences together, attempt to sing along to music and hear voices on the phone. ""We can call her upstairs when we're downstairs and she will hear us,"" Bob explains. But it's at mainstream school, in a classroom with hearing children, where Leia is really flying, thanks to assistants using sign language and giving her plenty of one-to-one time. ""She is picking up more and more and she's not far behind others of her age in most things,"" Bob says. At home, using her voice is what pleases her parents most. ""'I love you Daddy' is probably the best thing I've heard her say,"" Bob says. ""When I'm putting her to bed she now says 'good night Mummy', which is something I never expected to hear,"" Alison says. The cutting-edge surgery involves inserting a device directly into the brain to stimulate the hearing pathways in children born with no cochlea or auditory nerves. The implant is inserted directly into the brain next to the brainstem at the bottom of the brain A microphone and sound processor unit worn on the side of the head then transmits sound to the implant. This electrical stimulation can provide auditory sensations, but it cannot promise to restore normal hearing. However, Prof Dan Jiang, consultant otologist and clinical director of the Hearing Implant Centre at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, said some children can develop a degree of speech. ""The outcomes are variable. Some will do better than others,"" he said. ""They have to adapt to it and younger children do better so we like to insert the implant early if possible."" Children under five are best placed to learn new concepts of sound and respond to intensive therapy, he said. Susan Daniels, chief executive of the National Deaf Children's Society, said: ""Every deaf child is different and for some, technology like auditory brainstem implants can be the right option and can make a huge difference to their lives. ""With the right support, deaf children can achieve just as well as their hearing peers and this investment is another important step towards a society where no deaf child is left behind.""

"The group mostly included young children and their mothers Kosovo has brought back 110 of its citizens from Syria, mostly mothers and their children but also several jihadist fighters. The group contained 74 children, 32 women and four men suspected of fighting for the Islamic State group (IS) who were arrested on arrival. They flew back with the help of the US military before police escorted them to an army barracks near Pristina. The issue of repatriations has come to the fore since the collapse of IS. ""An important and sensitive operation was organised in which the government of Kosovo, with the help of the [US], has returned 110 of its citizens from Syria,"" Kosovo's Justice Minister, Abelard Tahiri, said on Saturday. ""We will not stop before bringing every citizen... back to their country and anyone that has committed any crime or was part of these terrorist organisations will face justice,"" he added. Has IS been defeated? Why countries face a dilemma over IS children How do countries deal with IS returnees? Kosovo, which declared independence from Serbia in 2008, is 90% Muslim. More than 300 of its citizens have travelled to Syria since 2012, according to government figures. This number includes 70 men who were killed fighting alongside jihadist groups, Reuters news agency reports. Police say 30 Kosovan fighters, 49 women and 8 children still remain in conflict zones in Syria and Iraq. A map showing the verified origin countries of children who travelled to Iraq or Syria In recent months, a number of women have come forward to say they want to return to their home countries, including the UK, US and France, so they could raise their children in peace. In response, the UK and US have barred two mothers from returning. Shamima Begum, who joined IS in Syria aged 15, begged to return home shortly before giving birth to a son, but the UK government refused to let her back. She did not renounce her allegiance to IS and the government removed her citizenship.There was much sympathy for her plight when her baby died in March. Meanwhile, that same month,France brought back five young childrenof jihadist fighters. The recent repatriations come weeks after some IS militants reportedly fled into the desert from Baghuz - their last stronghold. The area was declared ""freed"" by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) on 23 March. Although the declaration marked the last territorial victory over the group's ""caliphate"", experts warn it does not mean the end of IS or its ideology.

"Omar al-Bashir was deposed by the military after months of protests A large hoard of cash has been found at the home of Sudan's ousted president Omar al-Bashir and he is now being investigated for money laundering, prosecutors say. Security services found euros, dollars and Sudanese pounds totalling more than $130m (Â£100m). The ex-leader was placed under house arrest after months of protests led to his removal. Reports say Mr Bashir is now being held at the Kobar high-security prison. In pictures: A campaign of defiance Why Omar al-Bashir was overthrown Timeline: How Sudan got here A source in Sudan's judiciary told Reuters news agency that suitcases loaded with more than $351,000, â¬6m ($6.7m; Â£5.2m) and five billion Sudanese pounds ($105m) were found at Mr Bashir's home. The source also confirmed Mr Bashir was under investigation, telling Reuters prosecutors would ""question the former president in Kobar prison"". A picture carried by the Netherlands-based media outlet Radio Dabanga shows men in army uniforms standing over what appears to be several sacks full of cash. Allow Twitter content?

The money, which Radio Dabanga says was shown to reporters, was stuffed in bags designed to contain 50kg (110lbs) of grain. On Saturday, Sudan's attorney general said a new committee would be set up to oversee anti-corruption investigations. But despite moves to hold Mr Bashir and others to account, Sudan's army does not appear to have the confidence of protesters demanding civilian rule, BBC Africa correspondent, Alastair Leithead, says. Protesters fear that the military will continue to pull the strings Alastair Leithead, BBC News, Khartoum The mass sit-in continues in the centre of Khartoum, amid a lack of trust that the military council is committed to handing over power to a civilian transitional authority. Each day concessions are announced, but there's little proof that what's been promised has been delivered. There have been no images of the former president in prison, nor any response from the generals over a demand they give up power to a civilian administration. The general public prosecutor's announcement that Mr Bashir is being investigated for money laundering after cash was found at his home is news the demonstrators would like to hear. The Sudanese military toppled Mr Bashir on 11 April but demonstrators, led by The Sudanese Professionals Association, have vowed to stay on the streets until there is a move to civilian rule. Mr Bashir, who ruled Sudan for almost 30 years, is wanted by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for alleged war crimes in the country's western Darfur region. Sudan's military, however, says it will not extradite him and will try him in the country instead. This video can not be played 'Protesters won't move until they get real change' Uganda would consider offering the deposed leader asylum if he applied, the country's Minister for Foreign Affairs Henry Oryem Okello told Reuters. Until this week, Mr Bashir's whereabouts since his removal were unknown. The coup leader at the time, Awad Ibn Auf, said Mr Bashir was being detained in a ""safe place"". He himself stood down soon afterwards, with Lt Gen Abdel Fattah Abdelrahman Burhan named as head of the transitional military council. Demonstrators remain camped out at military headquarters in the Sudanese capital, Khartoum. Huge crowds braved scorching heat and fatigue for a 14th day on Friday, demanding that the military council hand over the reins of power to a civilian authority. Plans to unveil a civilian body to replace the military council will be announced on Sunday, the SPA said in a statement. Sudan protests: A campaign of defiance Why the protests started Ahmed Rabi, leader of the SPA, told The Associated Press that he and others behind the protest movement met the military council on Saturday. It is the third such meeting between them, with no sign of a breakthrough to end the deadlock. So far, the SPA has been uncompromising in its demands, fearful of a military-led administration stuffed full of Mr Bashir's allies. An SPA spokesman previously told the BBC that the group ""completely rejected"" the transitional military council leading the country, and said protesters seek the dismantling of state intelligence agencies and the ""full dissolution of the deep state"". Demonstrators have vowed to stay on the streets until there is a move to civilian rule Military council has announced a raft of new measures, including the end of censorship and new heads of the security forces. The council has arrested former government members and says it will put in place whatever civilian government and whichever prime minister opposition groups agree. Are military takeovers on the rise in Africa? But while the council promised not to remove protesters from their sit-in, it has also called on them to stop unauthorised roadblocks and ""let normal life resume"". ""Taking up arms will not be tolerated,"" military council spokesman Maj Gen Shams Ad-din Shanto said last week.

"Fire crews were called in from across the region to help deal with the blaze Firefighters have been working through the night to bring a large moorland blaze under control. West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service (WYFRS) said several acres of Ilkley Moor caught fire on Saturday after a day of soaring temperatures. The fire involves moorland above White Wells in Ilkley. Bradford Council is warning walkers to keep off the moors. Crews from 10 engines remained at the scene of the blaze overnight to damp down. Originally there were 14 crews at the scene but WYFRS said it had scaled back its response to the blaze. Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn said the ""awful scenes"" on the moor were a reminder ""of why we urgently need to tackle climate change"". On Saturday night Martyn Hughes, a watch manager at North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service which is assisting WYFRS, tweeted: ""The intense heat, steep slopes and rough terrain are causing the fire to spread rapidly whilst we try to get near the flames.""

Temperatures are expected to climb to 26C on Easter Sunday and 27C on Monday, though north-west Scotland could be clipped by outbursts of rain. The record temperature for Easter Sunday in the UK is 25.3C reached in Solent, Hampshire in April 2011. The Solent also lays claim to the hottest Easter Monday with 24C recorded, also in 2011. Met Office forecaster Helen Roberts said the Solent's records were the ""ones to keep an eye on and could be broken"".

"Libya's UN-backed government says it has launched a counter-offensive against Gen Khalifa Haftar's forces. Heavy fighting has erupted south of Tripoli after Libya's UN-backed government announced a counter-offensive against insurgent forces. It comes after days of limited advances by either side, in clashes which have killed 220 people. Soldiers loyal to Gen Khalifa Haftar launched an attack earlier this month with the aim of taking Tripoli. Prime Minister Fayez al-Serra hascondemned the ""silence"" of his international allies amid the fighting. Who is military strongman Khalifa Haftar? Why is Libya so lawless? Details of progress by both sides was not immediately clear. Mr Serra's Government of National Accord says it has carried out seven air strikes on areas held by Gen Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA). The group has been advancing on the city from multiple directions, and says it has taken Tripoli's international airport. The UN-backed government says it has launched a counter-offensive against Gen Haftar's forces. Soldiers loyal to the Tripoli government have been defending the capital since Gen Haftar began an assault on 4 April Gen Haftar, a former army officer, was appointed chief of the LNA in 2015 under an earlier, internationally recognised government based in Tobruk.. He has support from Egypt, Russia and the UAE. The White House says President Trump has spoken to Gen Haftar, suggesting the US may also endorse a new government under his command. Gen Haftar is fighting to unseat the UN-backed government Both America and Russia have refused to support a UK-drafted UN Security Council resolution calling for a ceasefire. An LNA spokesperson told AFP news agency: ""We have won the political battle and we have convinced the world that the armed forces are fighting terrorism."" Gen Haftar has support from several foreign powers, who see him as a potentially stabilising force in the chaos of post-revolution Libya, BBC Arab Affairs editor Sebastian Usher reports. Some Libyans feel the same way, but others see him as just another warlord bent on winning power by force, our editor.

"Prison staff are using technology to find and seize phones used illegally by inmates in England and Wales. New detection kits can narrow a phone's location down to a single jail cell, the Ministry of Justice said.

"This video can not be played The toxic legacy of the Vietnam War The US has launched a multi-million dollar clean-up operation at an air base in Vietnam it used to store the notorious chemical Agent Orange. The ten-year programme, unveiled more than four decades after the end of the Vietnam War, will cost $183m (Â£141m). The site at Bien Hoa airport, outside Ho Chi Minh City, is considered the most contaminated in the country. Agent Orange was a defoliant sprayed by US forces to destroy jungles and uncover the enemy's hiding places. It contained dioxin, which is one of the most toxic chemicals known to man and has been linked to increased rates of cancers and birth defects. Repairing the legacy of Agent Orange A one-man rescue mission in Vietnam The battle that destroyed a city Vietnam says several million people have been affected by Agent Orange, including 150,000 children born with severe birth defects. At Bien Hoa the chemical has contaminated the soil and seeped into nearby rivers. The site at Bien Hoa airport is considered the most contaminated in Vietnam The amount of dioxin in the area is four times higher than that found atDanang airport where a similar operation was completed in November. Vietnam country profile A statement from the US development agency USAID, which is behind the clean-up, described the site as the ""largest remaining hotspot"" of dioxin in Vietnam. ""The fact that two former foes are now partnering on such a complex task is nothing short of historic,"" US ambassador to Vietnam, Daniel Kritenbrink, said at Saturday's programme launch.

"Phil Foden is the first player born in the 2000s to score a Premier League goal for Man City Phil Foden's first Premier League goal returned Manchester City to the top of the table as they overcame Champions League conquerors Tottenham at Etihad Stadium. The 18-year-old's diving header, created by Sergio Aguero, after only five minutes ensured the reigning champions maintained the pressure on rivals Liverpool before their match at Cardiff City on Sunday. It was, however, a nervous performance in a game a far cry from the drama ofWednesday's European gamehere as City relied on goalkeeper Ederson to make several crucial saves. They also lost key midfielder Kevin de Bruyne to injury. Foden gave City the perfect start but Ederson thwarted Son Heung-min on three occasions and saved well from Christian Eriksen and Lucas Moura. Son was also denied by a magnificent tackle by Aymeric Laporte. Raheem Sterling had City's best chance after the break, only to be frustrated by the outstretched leg of Spurs keeper Paulo Gazzaniga - in for injured Hugo Lloris - but Pep Guardiola's side held on to move a point clear of Liverpool with four games left. 'Chewed fingernails and unbearable tension - Man City show their steely side' 'We are fighting with the best Liverpool ever' Who will win the title? Make your prediction The joy at the final whistle was a mixture of celebration and relief. This was a huge win for City and everyone inside the Etihad knew it. City needed to pick themselves up instantly after the crushing disappointment of their Champions League exit in the knowledge that one slip, even if it came in the shape of a draw, could hand the title to Liverpool. This was not the fluent City that is their trademark. The other qualities that can make champions came to the fore here - concentration, determination, heart, resilience and character. This video can not be played Man City will 'fight until the end' for title And it was in abundant supply throughout the team, from Ederson's outstanding saves, Laporte's priceless tackle on Son and in the outstanding performances of Foden and Bernardo Silva. Foden showed maturity beyond his years, even apart from his winner, demanding the ball, taking responsibility and directing more experienced players. It is early days but the evidence is clear that he is a special talent. Silva simply gets better, the ideal combination of limitless energy and creative skill, all employed within the Guardiola framework. The only downside, a considerable one, was that injury to De Bruyne, which, judging from the player's reaction, may be a problem that threatens his participation in the rest of the season. This City win will not earn maximum marks for artistic merit, but they did exactly what was needed after the traumatic Champions League exit as they recorded their 10th Premier League win in a row. Spurs felt City received a generous decision from referee Michael Oliver in the second half when they appealed for handball against Kyle Walker as he challenged with Dele Alli - but it is three points and on to the Manchester derby at Old Trafford on Wednesday. Race for the Premier League title Date Liverpool fixtures Date Man City fixtures 21 April Cardiff (A) 24 April Manchester United (A) 26 April Huddersfield (H) 28 April Burnley (A) 5 May Newcastle (A) 4 May Leicester (H) 12 May Wolves (H) 12 May Brighton (A) Son Heung-min may not have punished City as he did on Wednesday, but his performance confirmed he will be Tottenham's torch bearer in the absence of the injured Harry Kane. When Kane is missing, weight inevitably shifts on to the shoulders of the South Korean, but it is an added burden he carries lightly. Son was the man who had the Etihad's nerves on edge whenever he had the ball or was in the general vicinity of it. He brought important saves from Ederson and played with the pace and power that now makes him out as one of the Premier League's finest forwards. Spurs could not quite replicate their heroics of Wednesday when, even though they lost 4-3 on the night, they made it through to the Champions League semi-finals on aggregate. It is a result that inflicts some damage because, even though they remain in third place, the defeat offers up more hope to Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United in the increasingly competitive battle for the top four. Ederson's four saves helped Man City keep a 17th Premier League clean sheet of the season Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola:""Both teams have incredible players with heart and personality. It was a real tough game after our mental defeat on Wednesday and we knew we could have lost the Premier League today. ""As a footballer, I could not have done what my players have done today. The title is still in our hands. ""We've been on a remarkable run, playing against an incredible team like Tottenham and fighting for the Premier League with the best Liverpool team ever, one of the best teams I've seen in my life. ""We'll fight until the end and see how far we get."" On goalscorer Phil Foden:""He's so dynamic and adds extra intensity into our game. I wanted more attack and aggression in the box and he brings that to us with his work and ability. He did well today against top players."" Foden:""When an opportunity comes along, I want to be able to take it. Today it paid off. Kun (Aguero) did great to head it back across goal and luckily I was there. ""I want to get in the box and score goals. I look up to every player in this team and try and learn from them."" Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino:""It was an amazing game. Both teams competed really well and we deserved more. Ederson was man of the match. ""I am happy; disappointed with the result but so happy with the performance. Our next three games will be decisive in achieving all we want this season."" This video can not be played Mauricio Pochettino 'so happy' with Spurs in defeat Manchester City have won 25 home games in all competitions this season, the most in a single campaign and the most by an English top-flight club since Manchester United won 26 in 2010-11. Tottenham have lost five successive league away games for the first time since May 2004, a run of six under manager David Pleat. City have won their past 10 league games - their longest streak since a run of 18 between August and December 2017, which remains the top-flight record. Tottenham have lost 11 league games this season, as many as they had in their previous two campaigns combined (4 in 2016-17, 7 in 2017-18). Phil Foden became the third youngest City player to score in the Premier League after Micah Richards and Daniel Sturridge. Sergio Aguero has now failed to score in his past seven Premier League appearances against Spurs, having netted 10 goals in his first seven against them. Bernardo Silva was directly involved in seven of Manchester City's 15 shots in the match, having three attempts and creating four. Tottenham have lost a league game without Harry Kane taking part for the first time since October 2017 at Manchester United. Tottenham host Brighton at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Tuesday (19:45 BST), while City make the short trip to Old Trafford to play Manchester United on Wednesday (20:00).

"This video can not be played Hundreds of people were evacuated from the area near the communications ministry Seven people were killed in an attack on the Afghan ministry of information in Kabul, officials said. An explosion was heard at 11:40 local time (07:10 GMT) and sporadic gunfire continued for over six hours before officials declared the incident over. A ministry source said one of the attackers got inside the building. The attack comes a day after talks between Afghan officials and the Taliban were suspended, but the Taliban said they were not behind the assault. Among the dead were four civilians and three police officers, while another eight civilians were wounded. Although Kabul still sees fighting, this attack follows months of relative calm. The attack happened in a busy area of central Kabul, near one of the city's most popular hotels, a couple of other ministries, and the presidential palace. There were four attackers in total - all of whom were eventually shot dead by police officers. Why is Afghanistan more dangerous than ever? Will talks with the Taliban bring peace or chaos? 'We can't go back': The Afghan women determined not to lose The Serena Hotel, which is heavily fortified, is one of the few still used by foreign visitors. At 18 storeys high, the information ministry building is believed to be one of the tallest in Kabul. About 2,000 people were feared to have been stranded inside for hours, until they were eventually freed. Footage broadcast on local TV showed a small cloud of smoke rising near the tower block, while people climbed out of the windows of one of the lower levels, AFP news agency reported. Hundreds of civilians were evacuated from the building, the ministry said, but eight people were injured and taken to hospital. The attack happened in a busy area of central Kabul The Taliban's spokesman, Zabiullah Mujahid, said the organisation was not behind Saturday's attack. The Afghan branch of the Islamic State group has carried out a number of deadly attacks in Kabul but has not so far said it was behind this one. The US and the Taliban have been involved in attempts to negotiate a peace process. The sides have held five rounds of direct talks since October 2018, and are now in the middle of their sixth. A conference between officials from the militant group and about 250 Afghan politicians had been due to take place in the Qatari capital Doha on 20 and 21 April. But the meeting was abruptly called off on Thursday after the Taliban complained about the size and status of the Afghan delegation. In a statement, the Taliban accused the Afghan government of ""sabotaging this conference and peace efforts"". The building is believed to be one of the tallest in Kabul The goal is to resolve Afghanistan's civil conflict and negotiate the withdrawal of US forces in the country. The US also wants the Taliban to guarantee that Afghan territory won't be used by foreign militants, and that they won't pose a security threat to the rest of the world. In 2001 a US-led military coalition overthrew the Taliban for sheltering al-Qaeda, the militant group behind the 9/11 attacks. US officials say the conflict in Afghanistan now costs them about $45bn (Â£34bn) a year. The Taliban currently control and influence more territory than they have at any point in the past 18 years.

"This video can not be played PSNI released CCTV footage after Lyra McKee's murder Two teenage men have been arrested in connection with the killing of journalist Lyra McKee. The pair, aged 18 and 19, were detained under the Terrorism Act. Ms McKee, 29, was shot as she was observing rioting in Londonderry in Northern Ireland on Thursday night. It happened in the Creggan estate. Violence broke out after raids in the nationalist Mulroy Park and Galliagh areas by police investigating dissident republican activity. Ms McKee was standing near a police 4x4 vehicle with other journalists when she was shot. CCTV captured her final moments in the crowd and mobile phone footage showed the suspected gunman. The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said a gunman fired shots towards police officers at about 23:00 BST on Thursday. This video can not be played Journalist Lyra McKee, 29,  was shot during rioting in Londonderry In the video, the masked attacker leans from behind cover and appears to fire shots towards police and onlookers. There has been widespread condemnation of the killing. At a vigil in Derry on Friday, Ms McKee's partner, Sara Canning,described her as a ""tireless advocate and activist"" for the LGBT community. Ms Canning said her partner's dreams had been ""snuffed out by a single barbaric act"" and she had been left without ""the woman I was planning to grow old with"". ""The senseless murder of Lyra McKee has left a family without a beloved daughter, a sister, an aunt and a great-aunt; so many friends without their confidante,"" added Ms Canning. ""We are all poorer for the loss of Lyra."" Sara Canning (centre) was ""planning to grow old"" with her partner Lyra McKee PSNI Det Supt Jason Murphy, who is leading the investigation, described Ms McKee's death as ""senseless and appalling beyond belief"". As he appealed for information on Saturday, he said her killing hadled to a ""palpable change"" in the community's support of the police. ""Yesterday we realised that the vast majority of communities across the whole of Northern Ireland support policing and support police and they support the peace process,"" he added. ""What we saw yesterday was the visible demonstration of that within the Creggan community. A community that has been very frightened for a long time and for a large part has been held to ransom by terrorist organisations that claims to represent them."" Ms McKee's killing came 21 years after the Good Friday peace agreement was signed in Northern Ireland. The 1998 peace deal marked the end of decades of violent conflict - known as the Troubles - involving republicans and loyalists during which about 3,600 people are estimated to have died. The Good Friday Agreementwas the result of intense negotiations involving the UK and Irish governments and Northern Ireland's political parties.

"Floral tributes to Lyra McKee have been left at the scene of her shooting in Derry The killing of journalist Lyra McKee has led to a ""palpable change"" in community sentiment in support of policing in Northern Ireland, a senior detective has said. Ms McKee, 29, was shot while observing rioting in Londonderry's nationalist Creggan estate on Thursday. Two men, aged 18 and 19, arrestedunder the Terrorism Act were released without charge on Sunday. Det Supt Jason Murphy urged people to come forward with evidence. This video can not be played PSNI released CCTV footage after Lyra McKee's murder Journalist shot dead during Derry rioting Profile: 'Her commitment to truth was absolute' Speaking on Saturday, the detective leading the investigation said there was a sense that what had happened to Ms McKee had marked a ""real sea change"". He also warned that he had a broader concern about a ""new breed of terrorist coming through the ranks"". ""And that is very worrying for me,"" he added. But he said that police officers had felt a ""palpable"" change in the community sentiment towards policing. This video can not be played Journalist Lyra McKee, 29,  was shot during rioting in Londonderry ""Yesterday we realised that the vast majority of communities across the whole of Northern Ireland support policing and support police and they support the peace process,"" added Mr Murray. ""What we saw yesterday was the visible demonstration of that within the Creggan community. ""A community that has been very frightened for a long time and for a large part has been held to ransom by terrorist organisations that claims to represent them."" Ms McKee was standing near a police 4x4 vehicle with other journalists when she was shot on Thursday night. CCTV captured her final moments in the crowd and mobile phone footage showed the suspected gunman. Books of condolence have been opened across Northern Ireland for tributes to Lyra McKee In the video, the masked attacker can be seen leaning from behind cover and appears to fire shots towards police and onlookers. The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said that the gunman fired shots towards police officers at about 23:00 BST on Thursday. In a Facebook post, the political party Saoradh - a group that police have said is closely aligned to the New IRA - sought to justify violence on the night. They said Ms McKee was killed ""accidentally"" by a ""volunteer"" after the PSNI raided houses in Derry in search for weapons and ammunition. Who are the New IRA? The New IRA was formed in 2012 aftera number of dissident republican organisations said they were unifyingunder one leadership and is believed to be the largest dissident republican organisation. Saoradh, which means liberation in Irish, is a political group that was founded in 2016 and has the support of prisoners from the dissident group referred to as the New IRA. According to its constitution, Saoradh's objective is to ""effect an end to Britain's illegal occupation of the six counties"" and establish a 32-county Irish socialist republic. The party has been highly critical of Sinn FÃ©in in the past, with its chairman describing members as ""false prophets who have been defeated and consumed by the very system they claim to oppose"". Timeline: Dissident republican activity There has been widespread condemnation of the killing. At a vigil in Derry on Friday, Ms McKee's partnerSara Canning described her as a ""tireless advocate and activist""for the LGBT community. Her partner's dreams had been ""snuffed out by a single barbaric act"", said Ms Canning, and she had been left without ""the woman I was planning to grow old with"". Sara Canning said ""we are all poorer for the loss"" of her partner Lyra McKee Ms McKee's killing came 21 years after the Good Friday peace agreement was signed in Northern Ireland. The 1998 peace deal marked the end in the region of decades of violent conflict - known as the Troubles - involving republicans and loyalists during which about 3,600 people are estimated to have died. The Good Friday Agreementwas the result of intense negotiations involving the UK and Irish governments and Northern Ireland's political parties.

"Dissident republican groups oppose the 1998 Good Friday Agreement BBC News NI takes a look at significant events involving dissident republicans since March 2009. The term ""dissident republicans"" describes a range of individuals who do not accept the Good Friday Agreement - the 1998 peace deal which ended the worst of the Troubles in Northern Ireland. The Provisional IRA - the main armed republican paramilitary group for most of the Troubles - declared a ceasefire in the run up to the agreement and officially ended its violent campaign in 2005. Dissident republicanism is made up of various groups which broke away from the Provisional IRA in the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s, including the Continuity IRA and New IRA. The groups are much smaller than the Provisional IRA, although they have access to high-calibre weapons and have used improvised explosive devices and mortars in attacks and attempted attacks. They have continued to use violence to attempt to unite Northern Ireland with the Republic of Ireland in a single state but their activities have been sporadic and often undermined by the security services. A list containing the details of 10,000 police officers and civilian staff is in the hands of dissident republicans, police confirmed. The information was contained in a spreadsheet mistakenly released as part of a PSNI response to a freedom of information request. Chief Constable Simon Byrne said the data breach was on an industrial scale and included the surnames, initials and ranks of colleagues. He said dissident republicans could use the information, part of which appeared in redacted form on a wall in west Belfast, to""intimidate or target officers and staff"". Young hooded men prepare to throw a petrol bomb at police vehicle in Londonderry. Police described a petrol bomb attack on officers as ""senseless and reckless"". The trouble followed an illegal republican parade in Londonderry and came on the eve of a visit by US President Joe Biden to Belfast. DCI John Caldwell was also released from hospital in April and in a later interview said children witnessed""horrors that no child should ever have to"". The terrorism threat level in Northern Ireland is increased from substantial to severe, meaning the risk of attack or attacks is now ""highly likely"" instead of ""likely"". The move, based on an MI5 intelligence assessment, reverses a downgrade to the threat level in 2022, the first such downgrade in 12 years. A severe threat level is one step below critical, the highest level of threat. It comes after the shooting of Det Ch Insp John Caldwell in February and a bomb attack on police officers in November 2022. Senior police officer Det Ch Insp John Caldwell was shot at a sports complex in Omagh, County Tyrone, on 22 February. He was off duty and was putting footballs into the boot of his car after coaching young people when two gunmen approached him and shot him several times. An attempted murder investigation was launched. Police said the primary focus of their investigation was on violent dissident republicans, including the New IRA. The New IRA later claimed responsibility in a typed statement which appeared in Londonderry on Sunday 26 February. An attempted murder investigation was launched aftera police patrol vehicle was damaged in a bomb attackin Strabane, County Tyrone, on 17 November.

A suspicious device, which was later described by police as an elaborate hoax, was placed in the vehicle. Ch Supt Nigel Goddard described the attack as ""reckless"" and said detectives believed the New IRA were involved. Officers were attacked with petrol bombs following an Easter paradelinked to dissident republicans in Derry. The police described the attack at the City Cemetery on 18 April as ""premeditated violence"". The violence broke out following a parade that had been planned by the National Republican Commemoration Committee, which organises events on behalf of the anti-agreement republican party, Saoradh - a party police say islinked to the New IRA. A police officer was targeted in this attack in Dungiven A bomb was left near a police officer's car outside her home on 19 April in County Londonderry in what the police saidwas an attempt to kill her and her young daughter. The explosive was attached to a container of flammable liquid next to her car in Dungiven. Police said they linked the attempted murder to the New IRA. Police provided this image of the bomb Abomb was found in the Creggan area of Derry after police searches in the area on 9 September. The device was found in a parked car and was described by detectives as in ""an advanced state of readiness"" and was made safe by Army technical officers.

A long bang was heard on the Tullygally Road and a ""viable device"" was later found. Police said they believed the attack was set up to target officers responding to a call from the public. The bomb was discovered at Shandon Park Golf Club in east Belfast The ""New IRA"" claimedresponsibility for a bomb under a police officer's car at Shandon Park Golf Club in east Belfast.

The weapons including two shotguns, four handguns, explosives, ammunition and a suspected mortar tube Police said a ""significant amount of dangerous weapons"" were seized during a 12-day search operation in counties Armagh and Tyrone. Thirteen searches took place on land and properties in Lurgan and Benburb from 29 April to 11 May.

"Floral tributes to Lyra McKee have been left at the scene of her shooting in Derry The killing of journalist Lyra McKee has led to a ""palpable change"" in community sentiment in support of policing in Northern Ireland, a senior detective has said. Ms McKee, 29, was shot while observing rioting in Londonderry's nationalist Creggan estate on Thursday. Two men, aged 18 and 19, arrestedunder the Terrorism Act were released without charge on Sunday. Det Supt Jason Murphy urged people to come forward with evidence. This video can not be played PSNI released CCTV footage after Lyra McKee's murder Journalist shot dead during Derry rioting Profile: 'Her commitment to truth was absolute' Speaking on Saturday, the detective leading the investigation said there was a sense that what had happened to Ms McKee had marked a ""real sea change"". He also warned that he had a broader concern about a ""new breed of terrorist coming through the ranks"". ""And that is very worrying for me,"" he added. But he said that police officers had felt a ""palpable"" change in the community sentiment towards policing. This video can not be played Journalist Lyra McKee, 29,  was shot during rioting in Londonderry ""Yesterday we realised that the vast majority of communities across the whole of Northern Ireland support policing and support police and they support the peace process,"" added Mr Murray. ""What we saw yesterday was the visible demonstration of that within the Creggan community. ""A community that has been very frightened for a long time and for a large part has been held to ransom by terrorist organisations that claims to represent them."" Ms McKee was standing near a police 4x4 vehicle with other journalists when she was shot on Thursday night. CCTV captured her final moments in the crowd and mobile phone footage showed the suspected gunman. Books of condolence have been opened across Northern Ireland for tributes to Lyra McKee In the video, the masked attacker can be seen leaning from behind cover and appears to fire shots towards police and onlookers. The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said that the gunman fired shots towards police officers at about 23:00 BST on Thursday. In a Facebook post, the political party Saoradh - a group that police have said is closely aligned to the New IRA - sought to justify violence on the night. They said Ms McKee was killed ""accidentally"" by a ""volunteer"" after the PSNI raided houses in Derry in search for weapons and ammunition. Who are the New IRA? The New IRA was formed in 2012 aftera number of dissident republican organisations said they were unifyingunder one leadership and is believed to be the largest dissident republican organisation. Saoradh, which means liberation in Irish, is a political group that was founded in 2016 and has the support of prisoners from the dissident group referred to as the New IRA. According to its constitution, Saoradh's objective is to ""effect an end to Britain's illegal occupation of the six counties"" and establish a 32-county Irish socialist republic. The party has been highly critical of Sinn FÃ©in in the past, with its chairman describing members as ""false prophets who have been defeated and consumed by the very system they claim to oppose"". Timeline: Dissident republican activity There has been widespread condemnation of the killing. At a vigil in Derry on Friday, Ms McKee's partnerSara Canning described her as a ""tireless advocate and activist""for the LGBT community.

Sara Canning said ""we are all poorer for the loss"" of her partner Lyra McKee Ms McKee's killing came 21 years after the Good Friday peace agreement was signed in Northern Ireland. The 1998 peace deal marked the end in the region of decades of violent conflict - known as the Troubles - involving republicans and loyalists during which about 3,600 people are estimated to have died. The Good Friday Agreementwas the result of intense negotiations involving the UK and Irish governments and Northern Ireland's political parties.

Originally there were 14 crews at the scene but WYFRS said it had scaled back its response to the blaze. Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn said the ""awful scenes"" on the moor were a reminder ""of why we urgently need to tackle climate change"". On Saturday night Martyn Hughes, a watch manager at North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service which is assisting WYFRS, tweeted: ""The intense heat, steep slopes and rough terrain are causing the fire to spread rapidly whilst we try to get near the flames.""

"Clare Bronfman said she was ""truly remorseful"" for her role US heiress Clare Bronfman has pleaded guilty to her role in an alleged sex trafficking operation. Bronfman, the 40-year-old heir to the Seagram alcohol fortune, was accused of using more than $100m (Â£77m) to fund the suspected sex cult Nxivm. She pleaded guilty on two counts - conspiracy to conceal and harbour illegal immigrants for financial gain, and fraudulent use of identification. She told the court in Brooklyn that she was ""truly remorseful"". ""I wanted to do good in the world and help people,"" she added. ""However, I have made mistakes."" Six people in total have been accused of being involved with Nxivm, pronounced nexium. Bronfman is the fifth to plead guilty, with just one defendant - the suspected cult leader Keith Raniere - due to go on trial next month. Bronfman will be sentenced on 25 July. She could face up to 25 years in prison, although sentencing guidelines suggest it could be up to only 27 months. Nxivm is a group that started in 1998 as a self-help programme and says it has worked with more than 16,000 people, including Smallville actress Allison Mack, who pleaded guilty earlier this month. On its website, Nxivm describes itself as a ""community guided by humanitarian principles that seek to empower people and answer important questions about what it means to be human"". Despite its tagline of ""working to build a better world"", its leader, Mr Raniere, stands accused of overseeing a ""slave and master"" system within the group. Keith Raniere, the leader of Nxivm, goes on trial next month According to the group's website, it has suspended enrolment and events because of the ""extraordinary circumstances facing the company at this time"". Prosecutors allege the group mirrors a pyramid scheme, in which members paid thousands of dollars for courses to rise within its ranks. Bronfman, a philanthropist and former showjumper, is the daughter of the late Canadian businessman Edgar Bronfman, whose net worth was estimated to be about $2.6bn (Â£2bn). Bronfman was on Nxivm's executive board. The millions of dollars she was accused of giving to the group were thought to have been used to pay for fake identities and court summons against perceived enemies. Female recruits were also allegedly branded with Mr Raniere's initials and expected to have sex with him, as part of the system. 'Why I joined a cult and how I left' Actress Allison Mack pleads guilty Nxivm leader charged with sex trafficking Appearing at a court in Brooklyn, Bronfman admitted knowingly harbouring a woman brought to the US on a fake work visa in order to exploit her for labour. As part of her plea, she agreed to forfeit $6m (Â£4.6m) and not to appeal any prison sentence of 27 months or less. Mr Raniere, 58, was arrested in Mexico last year on sex trafficking charges, and is being held without bail. He has pleaded not guilty to charges against him. His defence team has argued that the alleged sexual relationships with women were consensual, and says he has denied child abuse charges against him.

"Blind sailor Mitsuhiro Iwamoto (L) celebrates with his navigator Doug Smith A blind Japanese sailor has completed a non-stop Pacific crossing, reportedly making him the first visually impaired person to do so. Mitsuhiro Iwamoto, 52, sailed the 8,700-mile (14,000 km) crossing with the help of a sighted navigator. His 12m (40 ft) yacht made port in Fukushima on Saturday morning, ending his two-month trip. He left California on 24 February with Doug Smith, an American navigator who assisted him. Blind man runs New York half marathon His first attempt at the journey in 2013 ended in failure after his boat struck a whale and sank. He had to be rescued by the Japanese military. Speaking at the port of Iwaki, he told Japan's Kyodo News that completing the challenge on his second attempt was a ""dream come true"". Mr Iwamoto made port in Fukushima on Saturday morning ""I'm the happiest person on earth,"" he said, according to the news agency. Mr Iwamoto, who lost his sight aged 16, steered the vessel while Mr Smith gave him verbal guidance, advising him on wind directions and potential hazards. He is the first blind person to successfully sail across the Pacific without stopping, the Japan Blind Sailing Association says. Mr Iwamoto had to be rescued on his first attempt in 2013 Determined to make the crossing second time around, Mr Iwamoto - a Japanese citizen who currently lives in San Diego - took part in triathlons. ""We undertake this voyage not only for personal accomplishment, but to send a message that anything is possible when people come together,"" Iwamoto wrote on his website. He and Mr Smith made the voyage to raise money for charity and for efforts to prevent diseases that cause blindness. Blind man climbs Europe's highest mountain.

"Carys opted for amputation after living with chronic pain When Carys Price had her lower left leg amputated, she was not going to let it stop her following her passion. Born with congenital talipes, known as 'club foot', she lived with almost constant pain. So at the age of 16 she opted for an amputation and a prosthetic leg that would prove a new lease of life. Now she is part of the Wales para-cheer team that will fly to Florida this weekend to compete at the World Cheerleading Championships. Despite her disability, Carys, of Ynyshir, Rhondda Cynon Taff, took up cheerleading aged five and was immediately hooked. ""I was always on medication, which helped, but it was still very painful - but I never thought of giving up,"" she said. ""There were some really tough times but cheerleading always made me happy."" Team members have paid for themselves to compete in Orlando After 49 operations, her condition was worsening and doctors agreed to Carys's request to amputate her leg below the knee in 2016. Yet rather than being a traumatic experience, it ""opened a whole new world"". ""I was scared because I didn't know what would happen but overall I was so happy,"" she said. ""The relief of being pain-free was almost instant. ""There were so many things I hadn't been able to do, like going out with friends. But having the amputation was the best decision I ever made.

"Phil Foden is the first player born in the 2000s to score a Premier League goal for Man City Phil Foden's first Premier League goal returned Manchester City to the top of the table as they overcame Champions League conquerors Tottenham at Etihad Stadium. The 18-year-old's diving header, created by Sergio Aguero, after only five minutes ensured the reigning champions maintained the pressure on rivals Liverpool before their match at Cardiff City on Sunday. It was, however, a nervous performance in a game a far cry from the drama ofWednesday's European gamehere as City relied on goalkeeper Ederson to make several crucial saves. They also lost key midfielder Kevin de Bruyne to injury. Foden gave City the perfect start but Ederson thwarted Son Heung-min on three occasions and saved well from Christian Eriksen and Lucas Moura. Son was also denied by a magnificent tackle by Aymeric Laporte. Raheem Sterling had City's best chance after the break, only to be frustrated by the outstretched leg of Spurs keeper Paulo Gazzaniga - in for injured Hugo Lloris - but Pep Guardiola's side held on to move a point clear of Liverpool with four games left. 'Chewed fingernails and unbearable tension - Man City show their steely side' 'We are fighting with the best Liverpool ever' Who will win the title? Make your prediction The joy at the final whistle was a mixture of celebration and relief. This was a huge win for City and everyone inside the Etihad knew it. City needed to pick themselves up instantly after the crushing disappointment of their Champions League exit in the knowledge that one slip, even if it came in the shape of a draw, could hand the title to Liverpool. This was not the fluent City that is their trademark. The other qualities that can make champions came to the fore here - concentration, determination, heart, resilience and character. This video can not be played Man City will 'fight until the end' for title And it was in abundant supply throughout the team, from Ederson's outstanding saves, Laporte's priceless tackle on Son and in the outstanding performances of Foden and Bernardo Silva. Foden showed maturity beyond his years, even apart from his winner, demanding the ball, taking responsibility and directing more experienced players. It is early days but the evidence is clear that he is a special talent. Silva simply gets better, the ideal combination of limitless energy and creative skill, all employed within the Guardiola framework. The only downside, a considerable one, was that injury to De Bruyne, which, judging from the player's reaction, may be a problem that threatens his participation in the rest of the season. This City win will not earn maximum marks for artistic merit, but they did exactly what was needed after the traumatic Champions League exit as they recorded their 10th Premier League win in a row. Spurs felt City received a generous decision from referee Michael Oliver in the second half when they appealed for handball against Kyle Walker as he challenged with Dele Alli - but it is three points and on to the Manchester derby at Old Trafford on Wednesday. Race for the Premier League title Date Liverpool fixtures Date Man City fixtures 21 April Cardiff (A) 24 April Manchester United (A) 26 April Huddersfield (H) 28 April Burnley (A) 5 May Newcastle (A) 4 May Leicester (H) 12 May Wolves (H) 12 May Brighton (A) Son Heung-min may not have punished City as he did on Wednesday, but his performance confirmed he will be Tottenham's torch bearer in the absence of the injured Harry Kane. When Kane is missing, weight inevitably shifts on to the shoulders of the South Korean, but it is an added burden he carries lightly. Son was the man who had the Etihad's nerves on edge whenever he had the ball or was in the general vicinity of it. He brought important saves from Ederson and played with the pace and power that now makes him out as one of the Premier League's finest forwards. Spurs could not quite replicate their heroics of Wednesday when, even though they lost 4-3 on the night, they made it through to the Champions League semi-finals on aggregate. It is a result that inflicts some damage because, even though they remain in third place, the defeat offers up more hope to Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United in the increasingly competitive battle for the top four. Ederson's four saves helped Man City keep a 17th Premier League clean sheet of the season Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola:""Both teams have incredible players with heart and personality. It was a real tough game after our mental defeat on Wednesday and we knew we could have lost the Premier League today. ""As a footballer, I could not have done what my players have done today. The title is still in our hands. ""We've been on a remarkable run, playing against an incredible team like Tottenham and fighting for the Premier League with the best Liverpool team ever, one of the best teams I've seen in my life. ""We'll fight until the end and see how far we get."" On goalscorer Phil Foden:""He's so dynamic and adds extra intensity into our game. I wanted more attack and aggression in the box and he brings that to us with his work and ability. He did well today against top players."" Foden:""When an opportunity comes along, I want to be able to take it. Today it paid off. Kun (Aguero) did great to head it back across goal and luckily I was there. ""I want to get in the box and score goals. I look up to every player in this team and try and learn from them."" Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino:""It was an amazing game. Both teams competed really well and we deserved more. Ederson was man of the match. ""I am happy; disappointed with the result but so happy with the performance. Our next three games will be decisive in achieving all we want this season."" This video can not be played Mauricio Pochettino 'so happy' with Spurs in defeat Manchester City have won 25 home games in all competitions this season, the most in a single campaign and the most by an English top-flight club since Manchester United won 26 in 2010-11. Tottenham have lost five successive league away games for the first time since May 2004, a run of six under manager David Pleat. City have won their past 10 league games - their longest streak since a run of 18 between August and December 2017, which remains the top-flight record. Tottenham have lost 11 league games this season, as many as they had in their previous two campaigns combined (4 in 2016-17, 7 in 2017-18). Phil Foden became the third youngest City player to score in the Premier League after Micah Richards and Daniel Sturridge. Sergio Aguero has now failed to score in his past seven Premier League appearances against Spurs, having netted 10 goals in his first seven against them.

"About 200 extra officers from other police forces are being sent to London The Met Police has requested about 200 extra officers from neighbouring forces to help deal with the Extinction Rebellion protests in central London. Oxford Circus was reopened to traffic on Saturday afternoon after officers cleared demonstrators. Protesters continue to occupy Waterloo Bridge and Parliament Square. The Met said 750 people have been arrested and 28 have been charged. Commissioner Cressida Dick said it had caused ""miserable disruption"". ""Every day we have had over 1,000 officers - and now over 1,500 officers - working to police these protests,"" she said. ""It's had an impact not just on the police but also on the public."" Pedestrians and vehicles cross the Oxford Circus junction after police cleared protesters The junction had previously been blocked by a pink boat since Monday At about 17:30 BST, police were able to clear protesters from the centre of Oxford Circus, allowing for traffic to flow through normally. Dozens of officers also carried out arrests on Waterloo Bridge and slowly removed campaigners who had attached themselves to a truck acting as a stage. Ms Dick said the force was still liaising with others and encouraging them to go to Marble Arch to carry out a ""lawful protest"". ""If you don't want to go to Marble Arch, then go home,"" she said. ""I've been walking about there today and I can assure you many people are very fed up."" Arrests in connection with the protest since it began on Monday have topped 750 It is understood the Met made a request to the National Police Coordination Centre (NPoCC) ""late on Thursday"" for help with extra officers from neighbouring regions in the east and south-east of England. Essex Police, Kent Police, Hampshire Constabulary and Sussex Police confirmed they had sent officers to London under national mutual aid protocols. Extinction Rebellion: Can the plan work? Police move in on climate protesters What is climate change? A spokesman for the National Police Chief's Council said ""forces routinely share officers through mutual aid"" in order to deal with large-scale events. He added: ""It is used to ensure an appropriate police presence exists where there is increased demand for it. ""NPoCC works with forces to determine their requirements should the need arise."" Protesters had blocked traffic through Oxford Circus since Monday The Met also quelled rumours that its cells are full. A spokesman said: ""One thing that is unusual about this demonstration is the willingness of those participating to be arrested and also their lack of resistance to the arrests. ""Our custody suites are not full and we are continuing to arrest those who are breaking the law."" He said contingency plans were in place should they become full. In London, there are 41 custody suites - 34 of which are owned by the Met, six by British Transport Police and one in Bishopsgate by City of London Police. Protesters have also occupied Waterloo Bridge and Parliament Square Officers on Waterloo Bridge have formed cordons while activists continue to play music and passers-by gather to watch. Members of the public watching have been asked to move on. Earlier, one demonstrator said to the group: ""Holding the space is important and being arrested is not undignified. ""We are here for an important reason, so we should be prepared to be removed for that. Being arrested is a statement."" The Met previously said it has had to cancel officers' leave over the Easter break On Good Friday, police removed a pink boat that had been parked in the middle of Oxford Circus since Monday. Earlier that day, actress Dame Emma Thompson addressed demonstrators from the top of the ship. Extinction Rebellion said nearly 50,000 people had signed up to join the group since the protests started. This video can not be played The co-founder of the protest group invites people to join Since the group was set up last year, members have shut bridges, poured buckets of fake blood outside Downing Street, blockaded the BBC and stripped semi-naked in Parliament. It has three core demands: for the government to ""tell the truth about climate change""; to reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2025; and to create a citizens' assembly to oversee progress. Controversially, the group is trying to get as many people arrested as possible. But critics say they cause unnecessary disruption and waste police time when forces are already overstretched.

"Cathedral beekeeper Nicolas Geant says the bees would have got ""drunk"" on smoke from the fire Notre-Dame's smallest residents have survived the devastating fire which destroyed most of the cathedral's roof and toppled its famous spire. Some 200,000 bees living in hives on the roof were initially thought to have perished in the blaze. However Nicolas GÃ©ant, the cathedral's beekeeper, has confirmed that the bees are alive and buzzing. Mr GÃ©ant has looked after the cathedral's three beehives since 2013, when they were installed. That was part of an initiative to boost bee numbers across Paris. The hives sit on top of the sacristy by Notre-Dame's south side, around 30m (98 ft) below the main roof.

"New track is being installed at Shawfield junction over the bank holiday weekend Engineering works on the West Coast Main Line are set to cause severe disruption for rail passengers over the Easter bank holiday weekend. Shawfield junction, south of Glasgow, is undergoing a Â£4m signal and track upgrade which will not be completed until Tuesday morning. Passengers travelling between Scotland and northern England will be affected. Network Rail admitted the work would cause disruption, but said a short-term line closure was unavoidable. National Rail said journey times to or from Scotland,externalcould be considerably extended over the bank holiday weekend. There are no train services running north of Lancaster, which means rail replacement coaches will operate between Glasgow and the north of England on Saturday, Sunday and Monday. Easter travel 2019: Where to avoid In addition, the closure of London Euston station means passengers will have to change services in order to reach the English capital. Virgin Trains has recommended that passengers avoid travelling. The West Coast Main Line serves London, Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool and Glasgow Donald Morris, Network Rail infrastructure projects programme manager, said: ""Our engineers will be working hard to complete this complex programme as quickly as possible for passengers. ""The West Coast Main Line plays a key role in the economic life of the country - carrying passengers and freight - and this work will help improve its reliability. ""We understand the inconvenience this work may cause to some passengers and residents, but such a huge investment in the railway cannot be delivered without a short-term closure of the line."" Further south on the West Coast Main Line, engineers will also be carrying out work between Beattock and Abington in South Lanarkshire.

"Chris Tait and Tammy Lavigne began planning their marriage blessing in Scotland two years ago A Canadian couple who travelled 3,000 miles to have their marriage blessed arrived in Scotland to find their dream castle venue had gone bust. Chris Tait and his wife, Tammy Lavigne, spent almost Â£2,000 on the romantic ceremony at Comlongon Castle in Dumfries and Galloway. But shortly after arriving in Scotland last weekend, they learned the business had collapsed. It left them two days to rearrange the blessing they spent two years planning. Mr Tait said the bombshell cast a shadow over the first few days of their holiday. And the couple fear they will be unable to recoup the money they shelled out on the ceremony. Couples' shock as wedding venue shuts Comlongon Castle had been one of Dumfries and Galloway's most popular wedding venues but it ceased trading on 8 April. The partnership that ran the hotel is applying to be declared bankrupt after running into cash-flow problems last year. Last year, the business was ordered to pay almost Â£40,000 to a former employee, after anemployment tribunal,externalruled she had been unfairly dismissed. Mr Tait, 47, told the BBC Scotland news website that he learned of the castle's closure in an email from a photographer booked to capture images of their ceremony. The paramedic from Ontario said it was a ""total shock"" as they had received an email from the hotel seven days earlier and ""everything was fine"". Comlongon Castle is attached to a 14-bedroom hotel ""We were told that there would be absolutely no problem,"" he said. ""I did email them on the 9th and did not receive a reply which I thought was a bit strange but I thought if there was any problems they would have contacted us. ""Then we arrived, and next thing we know, they're in administration."" The couple had been planning to take part in a ""Laird's Blessing"" - a symbolic ritual said to have its origins in Celtic ceremonies. They said they paid about Â£1,900 for a deal which included two nights at Comlongon, meals and a piper, with their first payment made in 2017. But when they learned the hotel at Clarencefield had closed, Mr Tait said his wife, who works in a regional police office, managed to make alternative arrangements. Instead, they had a ceremony at the blacksmith's in Gretna Green. The Comlongon Castle website directs visitors to accountants Johnston Carmichael, which has been appointed trustee ""It's not exactly what we wanted but at least we were able to pull something together,"" Mr Tait said. ""It was still an additional cost that we weren't expecting. We already had everything else paid for."" They have contacted accountants Johnston Carmichael, which is dealing with claims from creditors, but said they were given little hope of having their money returned. And as their first payment by credit card was made more than 500 days ago, their card holder has told them they will not issue a refund. ""It's quite disheartening to have this situation happening,"" Mr Tait said. ""You read about it - especially in North America - all the time but to have it actually affect you is eye-opening, just how unfair it is."" The couple said they felt sorry for the staff at the hotel who have now lost their jobs, but he criticised the owner for failing to alert them to the hotel's closure. The castle is set in 140 acres of grounds ""It just seems unfair that he knew what was going on in his books and just suddenly had to close down,"" Mr Tait said. ""It's not something that happens overnight - it's something you're aware of beforehand. ""If you know that's something approaching on 8 April and people are supposed to be showing up on the 16th from out-of-country, the least you could have done was contact all your patrons. Let them know."" He said it had ""definitely put a dampener"" on the first couple of days of the holiday but the couple were now travelling to Aberdeenshire and the Highlands and were enjoying excellent weather. ""We're trying to get as much in of Scotland as we can so we can at least praise its beauty when we go back home.""

"Sunbathers flocked to Bournemouth beach in Dorset on Saturday to enjoy the hot weather The Met Office has confirmed Saturday as the hottest day of the year, with 25.5C recorded in Gosport, Hampshire. And the UK is set for record-breaking temperatures over the rest of the Easter weekend, forecasters have said. Temperatures are expected to climb to 26C on Easter Sunday and 27C on Monday, though north-west Scotland could be clipped by outbursts of rain. The record temperature for Easter Sunday in the UK is 25.3C reached in Solent, Hampshire in April 2011. The Solent also lays claim to the hottest Easter Monday with 24C recorded, also in 2011. Met Office forecaster Helen Roberts said the Solent's records were the ""ones to keep an eye on and could be broken"".

"US classroom (file image) Two teenage girls have been arrested in the state of Florida for allegedly planning to murder nine people, US media report. The pair from Avon Park Middle School, both aged 14, were arrested on Wednesday after a teacher found a folder detailing their alleged plans. In eight sheets of notes, the girls allegedly laid out plans to obtain guns and move and dispose of the bodies. They are both being held in custody, pending a trial hearing. Each suspect faces nine counts of conspiracy to commit murder and three counts of conspiracy to commit kidnapping. The teacher reportedly noticed the girls acting ""hysterical"" whilst looking for the folder, and allegedly overheard one of them say ""I'm just going to tell them it's a prank if they call me or if they find it"". The teacher later found the folder, which had been labelled as ""Private info"", ""Do not open,"" and ""Project 11/9"". Inside,handwritten notes outlined a list of names and included detailed plans,externalabout how to carry out the killings, according to the broadcaster NBC. The documents talk about obtaining firearms and destroying evidence by burning and burying their victims' bodies. Another note also addressed what clothing the teenagers would wear for the task. ""NO NAILS,"" it reportedly read. ""NO Hair Showing from the moment we put on our clothes"". ""It doesn't matter if they thought it was a joke,"" said Scott Dressel, spokesperson for Highlands County Sheriff's Office,external, quoted by Fox47 news channel.

"Carys opted for amputation after living with chronic pain When Carys Price had her lower left leg amputated, she was not going to let it stop her following her passion. Born with congenital talipes, known as 'club foot', she lived with almost constant pain. So at the age of 16 she opted for an amputation and a prosthetic leg that would prove a new lease of life. Now she is part of the Wales para-cheer team that will fly to Florida this weekend to compete at the World Cheerleading Championships. Despite her disability, Carys, of Ynyshir, Rhondda Cynon Taff, took up cheerleading aged five and was immediately hooked. ""I was always on medication, which helped, but it was still very painful - but I never thought of giving up,"" she said. ""There were some really tough times but cheerleading always made me happy."" Team members have paid for themselves to compete in Orlando After 49 operations, her condition was worsening and doctors agreed to Carys's request to amputate her leg below the knee in 2016. Yet rather than being a traumatic experience, it ""opened a whole new world"". ""I was scared because I didn't know what would happen but overall I was so happy,"" she said. ""The relief of being pain-free was almost instant. ""There were so many things I hadn't been able to do, like going out with friends. But having the amputation was the best decision I ever made. It surprises people to hear that."" Amputee makes history on Everest summit Mascot to wear 'Swansea City legs' Veteran's fight to have leg amputated Carys, now 18 and studying childcare at Coleg y Cymoedd, remained determined to pursue the sport she loves and earned a place on the Wales para-cheer team. The 20-strong team, made up of both disabled and non-disabled athletes, will take on competitors from around the world in Orlando on Wednesday. ""After my operation, I thought if I could do it with two legs, I'd find a way of doing it with one,"" said Carys. ""I managed to get back into it and I'm proud of how far I've come. Now I'm so excited to compete for Wales. It's a dream come true."" The 20-strong team includes members with various disabilities The para-team has previously won gold at the World Championships The para-cheer team - aged between 14 and 27 - includes members with autism, visual impairment, brittle-bone disease and myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) from across Wales. They have a chance of success, having previouslywon gold and silver medals,externalin the freestyle pom category. Head coach Sabrina Mountjoy said: ""It's wonderful that this team has the opportunity to compete at the world championships. ""We should celebrate the fact that in Wales we are able to select an inclusive team that compete against the likes of the United States. ""It's such a special moment for them to compete for Wales.""

"US classroom (file image) Two teenage girls have been arrested in the state of Florida for allegedly planning to murder nine people, US media report. The pair from Avon Park Middle School, both aged 14, were arrested on Wednesday after a teacher found a folder detailing their alleged plans. In eight sheets of notes, the girls allegedly laid out plans to obtain guns and move and dispose of the bodies. They are both being held in custody, pending a trial hearing. Each suspect faces nine counts of conspiracy to commit murder and three counts of conspiracy to commit kidnapping. The teacher reportedly noticed the girls acting ""hysterical"" whilst looking for the folder, and allegedly overheard one of them say ""I'm just going to tell them it's a prank if they call me or if they find it"". The teacher later found the folder, which had been labelled as ""Private info"", ""Do not open,"" and ""Project 11/9"". Inside,handwritten notes outlined a list of names and included detailed plans,externalabout how to carry out the killings, according to the broadcaster NBC. The documents talk about obtaining firearms and destroying evidence by burning and burying their victims' bodies. Another note also addressed what clothing the teenagers would wear for the task. ""NO NAILS,"" it reportedly read. ""NO Hair Showing from the moment we put on our clothes"". ""It doesn't matter if they thought it was a joke,"" said Scott Dressel, spokesperson for Highlands County Sheriff's Office,external, quoted by Fox47 news channel.

"More than 1,000 revellers went to an illegal rave in Carmarthenshire in 2018 People are being urged to help prevent illegal raves from damaging the countryside in Wales. Illegal parties frighten residents, harm wildlife and damage the environment, Dyfed-Powys Police said. With longer daylight hours and dry weather on the way, there are concerns raves are being planned. Police want people in Pembrokeshire, Ceredigion, Powys and Carmarthenshire to report anything suspicious in order to help them tackle the problem. The force said a swift response was crucial to preventing illegal festivals and parties becoming established. Last year,more than 1,000 revellers descended on the small villageof Brechfa, Carmarthenshire. When ravers are your neighbours New police tactics for festive raves This video can not be played Rave ""ruined bank holiday weekend"" Residents said human faeces and drug paraphenalia were among the mess left behind after the four-day rave. They were critical of the police's response and the force's police and crime commissioner, Dafydd Llywelyn, saidlessons ""must be learned""to prevent a repeat. Police say social media has made it easier to organise raves at short notice and for numbers to grow quickly. How the underground scene has never really gone away The rave that changed the law Residents picked up some of the mess left at the site of the rave Supt Robyn Mason said: ""We keep an eye on social media but the organisers of these raves know that we do that. ""There's nothing better than the local communities who see and hear things happening. Hopefully then we can deal with these events before they escalate. ""Once they start they are very challenging and it's more a case of tolerating it and dealing with the aftermath. ""It's frightening for people living in small isolated communities and there's the significant impact loud music has on wildlife and that hundreds or thousands of people have on the environment. ""If those rave-goers understood that then perhaps they would consider doing something else with their leisure time."" Litter left after a rave at Halfway Forest near Llandovery Natural Resources Wales said the impact of illegal raves on forests, such as Halfway Forest near Llandovery, could be ""devastating"" and wasted limited resources. It has installed lockable barriers at several access points to Brechfa forest and increased patrols before weekends. Land Management team leader Dai Rees said: ""Last year's illegal rave at Brechfa Forest not only caused distress to local people but also required considerable time and money to clean up afterwards. ""We strongly urge anyone who is concerned about any suspicious activity in their local forest to report it to the police.""

"This video can not be played Hundreds of people were evacuated from the area near the communications ministry Seven people were killed in an attack on the Afghan ministry of information in Kabul, officials said. An explosion was heard at 11:40 local time (07:10 GMT) and sporadic gunfire continued for over six hours before officials declared the incident over. A ministry source said one of the attackers got inside the building. The attack comes a day after talks between Afghan officials and the Taliban were suspended, but the Taliban said they were not behind the assault. Among the dead were four civilians and three police officers, while another eight civilians were wounded. Although Kabul still sees fighting, this attack follows months of relative calm. The attack happened in a busy area of central Kabul, near one of the city's most popular hotels, a couple of other ministries, and the presidential palace. There were four attackers in total - all of whom were eventually shot dead by police officers. Why is Afghanistan more dangerous than ever? Will talks with the Taliban bring peace or chaos? 'We can't go back': The Afghan women determined not to lose The Serena Hotel, which is heavily fortified, is one of the few still used by foreign visitors. At 18 storeys high, the information ministry building is believed to be one of the tallest in Kabul. About 2,000 people were feared to have been stranded inside for hours, until they were eventually freed. Footage broadcast on local TV showed a small cloud of smoke rising near the tower block, while people climbed out of the windows of one of the lower levels, AFP news agency reported. Hundreds of civilians were evacuated from the building, the ministry said, but eight people were injured and taken to hospital. The attack happened in a busy area of central Kabul The Taliban's spokesman, Zabiullah Mujahid, said the organisation was not behind Saturday's attack. The Afghan branch of the Islamic State group has carried out a number of deadly attacks in Kabul but has not so far said it was behind this one. The US and the Taliban have been involved in attempts to negotiate a peace process. The sides have held five rounds of direct talks since October 2018, and are now in the middle of their sixth. A conference between officials from the militant group and about 250 Afghan politicians had been due to take place in the Qatari capital Doha on 20 and 21 April. But the meeting was abruptly called off on Thursday after the Taliban complained about the size and status of the Afghan delegation. In a statement, the Taliban accused the Afghan government of ""sabotaging this conference and peace efforts"". The building is believed to be one of the tallest in Kabul The goal is to resolve Afghanistan's civil conflict and negotiate the withdrawal of US forces in the country. The US also wants the Taliban to guarantee that Afghan territory won't be used by foreign militants, and that they won't pose a security threat to the rest of the world. In 2001 a US-led military coalition overthrew the Taliban for sheltering al-Qaeda, the militant group behind the 9/11 attacks. US officials say the conflict in Afghanistan now costs them about $45bn (Â£34bn) a year. The Taliban currently control and influence more territory than they have at any point in the past 18 years.

"Nearly one in 10 heart attacks and strokes in England and Wales could be prevented if routine check-ups were better targeted, say researchers. Currently, people aged 40 and over are eligible to have their heart health assessed every five years. But UCL scientists say people at low risk are being checked too often while those considered at high risk are not checked often enough. They say a personalised approach could save lives without costing any more. Chances of a heart attack or stroke can be worked out by looking at risk factors such as blood pressure, cholesterol and blood-sugar levels, age, family history and whether the person smokes. High-risk patients are told to change their lifestyle, and if that does not work they are offered statins to reduce ""bad"" cholesterol or drugs to lower blood pressure. The researchers followed 7,000 people to see how long they spent in different risk categories. The study, in the Lancet Public Health, showed: ""Low-risk"" patients took an average of nine years to reach ""intermediate-low-risk"" ""Intermediate-low-risk"" patients spent an average of seven years in this category; 90% went on to become ""intermediate-high-risk"" But within four years, 70% of ""intermediate-high-risk"" patients became ""high-risk"" and needed treatment The researchers then simulated different ways of screening people depending on their heart-risk category. For example, screening low-risk patients every seven years, intermediate-low every four years and intermediate-high every year cost the same as the current system. However, the targeted system would enable high-risk patients to be treated sooner and prevent 8% of heart attacks and strokes, say the researchers. That would prevent 5,000 people a year in England and Wales having a potentially life-threatening heart attack or stroke. Prof Mika Kivimaki, one of the researchers, said: ""The key message is use individualised screening, not one-size-fits-all. ""I believe this will change because there is a tendency towards precision medicine and individualised treatment and prevention. ""I think this will be taken up in future and I hope it will happen sooner rather than later."" The next stage of the research would be to perform a clinical trial to see whether switching screening methods would actually make a difference. Prof Sir Nilesh Samani, medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said: ""While changing the frequency of heart-health check-ups based on a person's individual risk could potentially save lives and costs, it's easier said than done. ""An issue that is even more important to address is why so many people who could benefit from health checks are not getting them in the first place. ""If you know you're at higher risk of developing heart and circulatory disease, it's really important to attend regular health checks to help manage your risk factors to prevent problems later in life.""

"Earlier this month John, who believed he was due a tax refund, received a text message from ""InfoHM"". ""I was bleary-eyed from waking up early,"" he says. ""The excitement of what my tax refund would be overwhelmed my normally pretty rational brain."" He followed online instructions, and unwittingly provided personal and bank account details to online fraudsters. HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) is now warning young adults to be wary of such phone scams. In April and May, the government body says, fraudsters target vulnerable people with fake messages to coincide with the time legitimate rebates are being processed. Because younger adults typically manage their finances via their mobile phones, they can be particularly susceptible to an approach via text message, HMRC warns. Last Spring, HMRC received 250,000 reports of such scams. Can't save money? Is this the answer? Minimum wage: How high could the lowest salaries go? Fake HMRC phone scams 'surge by 360%' John, who did not want the BBC to use his real name, says he is now ""cringing"" over falling for it. But he says the page he was directed to was ""the spitting image"" of a gov.uk site. After entering his national insurance number and date of birth, it informed him he was due a credible sounding rebate of Â£462. He ended up providing details including his bank details and even his mother's maiden name. Example of a scam text, provided by HMRC ""I didn't even think twice about giving out this information to this website,"" he says. ""They just have to catch you off guard. If I'd have got the text yesterday at 11:30am after a good night's sleep, I'd have been like: 'This is clearly a scam'."" John reported the breach to HMRC and Action Fraud, and has since put in place extra online security on his accounts. ""You don't need to tell me I'm an idiot,"" he says. ""I know I'm an idiot, this is one of the most idiotic things I've ever done."" The HMRC says it never requests bank details by text or phone, and that it is shutting down hundreds of sites a week associated with these schemes, which are known as ""phishing scams"". ""We are determined to protect honest people from these fraudsters who will stop at nothing to make their phishing scams appear legitimate,"" says head of customer services at HMRC, Angela MacDonald. ""If you receive one of these emails or texts, don't respond and report it to HMRC so that more online criminals are stopped in their tracks."" Scammers also use phone calls, voicemails and emails, which may contain computer viruses designed to copy personal or financial information.

"New track is being installed at Shawfield junction over the bank holiday weekend Engineering works on the West Coast Main Line are set to cause severe disruption for rail passengers over the Easter bank holiday weekend. Shawfield junction, south of Glasgow, is undergoing a Â£4m signal and track upgrade which will not be completed until Tuesday morning. Passengers travelling between Scotland and northern England will be affected. Network Rail admitted the work would cause disruption, but said a short-term line closure was unavoidable. National Rail said journey times to or from Scotland,externalcould be considerably extended over the bank holiday weekend. There are no train services running north of Lancaster, which means rail replacement coaches will operate between Glasgow and the north of England on Saturday, Sunday and Monday. Easter travel 2019: Where to avoid In addition, the closure of London Euston station means passengers will have to change services in order to reach the English capital. Virgin Trains has recommended that passengers avoid travelling. The West Coast Main Line serves London, Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool and Glasgow Donald Morris, Network Rail infrastructure projects programme manager, said: ""Our engineers will be working hard to complete this complex programme as quickly as possible for passengers. ""The West Coast Main Line plays a key role in the economic life of the country - carrying passengers and freight - and this work will help improve its reliability. ""We understand the inconvenience this work may cause to some passengers and residents, but such a huge investment in the railway cannot be delivered without a short-term closure of the line.""

"An eyewitness said three men ran across the pedestrianised area at the end of Ashbourne Road and into Deans Road Two people have been arrested after a six-year-old boy was injured when shots were fired at a house. The boy is thought to have been inside the property in Wolverhampton when it was targeted with a shotgun shortly before 16:00 BST. He sustained non life-threatening injuries to his back and hand in the shooting on Ashbourne Road in the Eastfield area of the city.

"Dissident republican activity has been increasing of late, with police in Northern Ireland fearful of a spate of violent incidents marking the anniversary of the 1916 Easter Rising. Londonderry's Creggan estate is central to their concerns. An intelligence-led operation took them into the area late on Thursday night in a hunt for weapons and ammunition. They were concerned they could be used in the days ahead to attack officers. The group blamed for killing journalist Lyra McKee is known as the New IRAand was behind a bomb attack outside the city's courthouse at the start of the year. There have been other signs of violent intentions elsewhere. Recently, a horizontal mortar tube and command wire were discovered near Castlewellan in County Down. The dissident republican threat remains classed as severe and in recent days the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) has been assessing what could, in particular, occur over coming days. They had called for calm ahead of illegal parades planned in Londonderry and Lurgan in County Armagh. But that appeal was shattered by gunfire that killed a journalist standing near police lines.

"This video can not be played One of the couple's children reads a statement during the sentencing A couple from the US state of California have been sentenced to life in prison for starving and torturing all but one of their 13 children. David and Louise Turpin were arrested in January 2018 when their 17-year-old daughter escaped their home in the city of Perris and raised the alarm. The children had been abused for at least nine years and some were found chained up in filthy conditions. But several of the children told the court they had forgiven their parents. The couple are expected to serve the rest of their lives behind bars, unless they are granted parole in 25 years. The couple's Facebook page contained numerous family photos The Turpins wept as they heard victim-impact statements from four of their children at Friday's hearing. One child recounted being haunted by the ordeal. I cannot describe in words what we went through growing up,"" said his statement. ""Sometimes I still have nightmares of things that had happened such as my siblings being chained up or getting beaten. ""That is the past and this is now. ""I love my parents and have forgiven them for a lot of the things they did to us."" David Turpin broke down as he learned his fate Another child, in a statement read by her brother, also forgave her parents for the abuse. ""I love both of my parents so much,"" she said. ""Although it may not have been the best way of raising us, I am glad that they did because it made me the person I am today."" How can parents torture their children? 'Happy family' image hid house of horrors But not all the children were so conciliatory. One daughter, who was visibly shaking, said: ""My parents took my whole life from me, but now I'm taking my life back. ""I'm a fighter, I'm strong and I'm shooting through life like a rocket."" She added: ""I saw my dad change my mom. They almost changed me, but I realised what was happening."" Louise Turpin occasionally smiled during Friday's sentencing David and Louise Turpin cried as they apologised for the treatment of their children. The 57-year-old father's lawyer read a prepared statement on his behalf, saying: ""My home schooling and discipline had good intentions. ""I never intended for any harm to come to my children. I love my children and I believe my children love me."" He was an engineer for major US defence contractors Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman. David and Louise Turpin have agreed to lengthy prison terms after pleading guilty to torture, child abuse and false imprisonment Speaking directly to the court, housewife Louise Turpin, 50, said she was ""truly sorry"" for what she had done. ""I love my children so much,"" she said. ""I really look forward to the day I can see them, hug them and tell them I'm sorry."" The couple sat stony-faced as the judge rebuked them for their ""selfish, cruel and inhuman treatment"". Judge Bernard Schwartz said: ""You have severed the ability to interact and raise your children that you have created and brought into this world. The Turpin family with an Elvis impersonator in Las Vegas, where the parents renewed their vows ""The only reason that your punishment is less than the maximum time in my opinion is because you accepted responsibility at an early stage in the proceeding. ""And you spared your children having to relive the humiliation and the harm they endured in that house of horrors."" The tidy exterior of the middle-class family home 70 miles (112km) south of Los Angeles offered a veneer of respectability that masked the squalor and stench of human waste found by authorities within. The children, between the ages of two to 29 at the time of the police raid, were severely malnourished. A 22-year-old son was discovered chained to a bed. His two sisters had just been released from shackles. The victims were forbidden to shower more than once a year, were unable to use the toilet and none of them had ever seen a dentist. The Turpins on a family trip to Disneyland - it was apparently a favourite destination Some of the adult siblings' growth had been so severely stunted by starvation that authorities at first mistook them for children. Newly released audio of their daughter's call to 911, obtained by ABC,external, provides a hint of the conditions in which the children lived. ""Two of my sisters and one of my brothers... they're chained up to their bed"", the 17-year-old girl, who did not know her own address, told the emergency operator. ""Sometimes I wake up and I can't breathe because how dirty the house is."" The girl was also unaware of the year or month, or the meaning of the word ""medication"". The children - whose names all begin with the letter J - were kept indoors, but were allowed out for Halloween, or on family trips to Disneyland and Las Vegas. About 20 people from across the country, including nurses and psychologists, have offered to care for the seven adult siblings and six children. What we know about shackled siblings' lives.

The US Justice Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment from the BBC, and no detail of charges has been revealed. In a statement,Free Joseon said it was ""dismayed"" by arrest warrants being executed,external. ""The last US citizen who fell into the custody of the Kim regime returned home maimed from torture and did not survive,"" said spokesperson Lee Wolosky.

Members of the group allegedly made off with several computers and hard drives, data from which was allegedly passed on to American authorities.

"When Toronto Raptors won the NBA Finals against Golden State Warriors last night, they weren't just celebrating a sporting success. The Canadian basketball team had managed something perhaps more significant - killing the Drake curse. The rapper has for years been taunted by sports fans for bringing ""bad luck"" to their teams. Now the star has finally overseen a win, watching his favourite team become the first Canadians to win the NBA. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

Football squads have previously been banned from posting selfies with Drake and he's been blamed for big losses by Anthony Joshua, Serena Williams and Conor McGregor. But it seems as though Drake's bad omen has finally been lifted. British boxer Anthony Joshua was itslast notable ""victim"", earlier this month, when he lost his heavyweight title fight. But when Joshua met Drake in March, he was so confident of breaking the ""curse"" that he tweeted this photo. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The British boxer (who was 1-25 favourite to win) was beaten by Andy Ruiz Jr during their world heavyweight title fight in New York's Madison Square Garden. ""He's a champion for now, I shall return,""he said after the fight. But he'll probably want to make that return after hanging out with some different celebrity friends. Sports fans on Twitter were quick to lay the blame on Drake - rather than the skills of Anthony's opponent. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Earlier this year, the Drake ""curse"" also struck for Paris Saint-Germain's Layvin Kurzawa, when the footballer posed for a photo with the Canadian star and then had his team lose their very next game. PSG's spectacular 5-1 loss to Lille reignited suspicions that Drake, while obviously multi-talented, is a curse on every sports star he meets. And AS Roma wanted nothing to do with it.

Paul Pogba saw Drake perform at the Manchester Arena and got a picture taken with him - not long before Manchester United lost 2-1 to Wolves in the FA Cup. It was a similar story for Arsenal's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who was at one of Drake's seven shows at the O2 in London. After losing 1-0 to Everton the following weekend, plenty of Gooners will probably be wishing he'd never posed for a picture. Allow Instagram content?

And could the rapper also be to blame for Borussia Dortmund losing 5-0 to Bayern Munich, after hanging out with their English rising star Jadon Sancho? At this point, why not? How it all began The Drake Curse has become a bit of asocial media phenomenonin recent years. In a way, it kicked off with the team that seems to have finally broken the spell this week - the Toronto Raptors. He became a global ambassador for the basketball club in 2013, and can normally be seen cheering them on from the sidelines whenever they've got a big game. Unfortunately though, until their win last night, the last six years have seen the Raptors develop a bit of a reputation for choking in those big games. Luckily that's no longer the case. The standard ""watching sport"" expression of a man who's cursed In 2015 Serena Williams was trying to become the first woman to win all four tennis Grand Slams in a calendar year since Steffi Graf did it in 1988. But 2015 was also the year that Drake was spotted watching a lot of her games. Roberta Vinci was a 300-1 underdog when she faced Serena in the US Open - but we're pretty sure by now you can guess what the outcome of the match was. And if you still need more evidence, last year Conor McGregor tapped out in the fourth round of his fight against Khabib Nurmagomedov. Any guesses who he'd been hanging out with beforehand?

With so many infamous examples, it's unsurprising that Drake has got in on the joke. Ahead of the game that decided who'd be playing in the most recent Super Bowl, Drake wore a jumper featuring the logos of all four teams that were in with a chance. Two teams had to make it to the final, so surely that was the end of the curse? What followed was the lowest-scoring Super Bowl in history - a curse in the eyes of everyone who watched it. But maybe now the Toronto Raptors have taken the trophy home Drake will no longer be banned from hanging out with sports stars.

"Sharna Jackson's debut novel stars sisters Norva and Nik Author Sharna Jackson is something of a rarity. As a black children's writer, she's already in a minority. But her debut book High-Rise Mystery, a detective story starring young black sisters and featuring a diverse cast, puts Jackson in an extra select league. ""When I was young, I kept on reading and watching but the representation wasn't there,"" Jackson tells BBC News. ""It was hard to find role models outside popular culture. ""When I read, the default in my head was 'white'. Unless the character was black, it wouldn't be stated."" According to the recent reportBookTrust Represents,external, covering 2007-2017, just 5.6% of published UK children's authors and illustrators are from a black and minority ethnic (BAME) background. And in 2018,figures from the Centre for Literacy in Primary Education,external(CLPE) showed that of the 9,115 children's books published over the previous 12 months, 4% featured BAME characters. Only 1% had a character of colour as lead. In many cases, the stories were about social justice issues or conflict rather than mystery, magic or fun. Farrah Serroukh, director of the CLPE study, says lack of representation is a ""cross-sector systemic issue"".  But, she adds, ""it is fundamental for a child's personal development that they see themselves reflected in the pages of the books they read and have the opportunity to experience realities beyond their own... such self-affirming experiences are invaluable in nurturing a child's reader identity"". Jackson confirms she struggled in her formative years to find anyone to associate with on the page. Now the problem is being repeated with her nine-year-old son, she says. And, she says, the quality of the representation is vital too. ""All children need to see themselves and others reflected in culture - representation leads to empathy. That visibility is extremely important, but so is moving away from stereotypes and one-note, 'prop' characters. ""I don't just want to read about black children in 'issue-based' narratives. Why can't black children exist in 'white' genres? Why can't they see themselves being clever, creative and having fun?"" Lack of representation can lead BAME children to become dispirited by reading and quashes ambitions to enter publishing, so extending the problem into the adult market. Former Children's Laureate Malorie Blackman is best known for the series Noughts and Crosses This was recently highlighted in a campaign to encouragemore women BAME crime writers,external, backed by JK Rowling and other big names. Jill Coleman of BookTrust says: ""The world that children's books represents has a huge impact on how young readers see themselves and the world around them and on their aspirations for the future."" Former Children's LaureateMalorie Blackman said in 2014,external: ""A very significant message goes out when you cannot see yourself at all in the books you are reading... it is saying 'well, you may be here, but do you really belong?'"" Jackson says she'd always harboured a desire to be an author but concentrated on her career as a curator engaging children in the arts. She loved old-fashioned detective stories, such as Poirot and Sherlock, as well as the concept of mash-up genres. Her idea was to combine the two in a children's novel, one that embraced diversity, felt relevant and empowered its readers. ""I thought it'd be really interesting to take a traditional murder mystery and set it in a council estate and see what happened,"" says Jackson. ""I also thought it's important to be writing stories where young diverse people can see themselves and doing interesting things."" When Knights Of, an inclusive children's publisher, was founded by Aimee Felone and David Stevens in 2017, Jackson ""reached out to David on Twitter and he said, 'why don't you consider writing a book?'"". High-Rise Mystery stars black sleuthing sisters Norva, 13, and Nik, 11, living on a London council estate. Their latest, and biggest, case is uncovering who killed Hugo, the much-liked art teacher and antiques dealer. Farrah Serroukh says the encouragement to increase BAME representation in publishing has to be ongoing They are super smart and eagle-eyed. And their skilled use of technology, analytics and gut instinct keeps them one step ahead. Nik and Norva are also chalk and cheese. ""They are both like me but different parts of my personality,"" explains Jackson. ""I went through a phase where I loved shaving my head because it was really practical and that's like Nik. She's very straightforward and 'bish, bash, bosh,' gets things done. ""Norva is more flighty and dramatic and that can also be me."" The story has an eclectic cast of varied age, background and foibles. ""I wanted to make them feel engaging and like people you want to spend time with even if they were doing bad things,"" says Jackson. BookTrust's Jill Coleman says they aim to increase the number of BAME authors and illustrators from 5% to 10% by 2022 But their ethnicities are only implied.  ""My thinking was that if a character is black it doesn't occur to them that they are. That is just the default,"" says Jackson. Jackson grew up in Luton, which she describes as a ""much maligned town that has a lot to celebrate"" and didn't want to perpetuate the similar negative stereotype suffered by housing estates. ""I worried for a second but the fact is there are black people on estates and instead of shying away from it, let's try to tell some interesting stories,"" she says. ""Estates get a bad press but there are people living there having good lives and doing great things. ""I was friends with children who lived on estates and I was always struck by the sense of community and everybody mucking in. It felt really special."" And she hopes her story will appeal regardless of background. ""It will give a window onto a world that's completely different. It may not be not directly relevant to their lives, but neither is going into space."" Jackson's son Joseph kept the story grounded. They transformed their home into a makeshift police investigation room, with Post-it notes over the walls and up the stairs. ""He was especially brilliant at collecting quotes and thinking of possible murder methods and weapons, which was a bit worrying!"" says Jackson. David Stevens and Aimee Felone of publisher Knights Of foster diversity in their authors and workforce ""But his input helped keep the writing in touch with who was writing it for. Input from kids is a vital part of writing or creating anything for children - it makes the end product better."" For the push for more BAME children's stories and authors to be more than a trend, the encouragement has to be ongoing, says Farrah Serroukh. She also says under-representation is not limited to the UK, illustrated in the US by theUniversity of Winsconsin-Madison's research,external. Initiatives in publishing and in schools are up and running or in the pipeline, galvanised by the CLPE report, she says. The report will now be issued annually. Knights Of is an independent publisher aiming to foster diversity in their authors and workforce by demystifying the industry. ""Publishing is so secretive. And you have to know the right people to get ahead. There's a lack of knowledge within certain communities of the routes into publishing,"" says Aimee Felone. ""And then there's not seeing themselves in bookshops. Before you can even consider being a published author you have to see yourself as one. ""That's not to say that people should only be able to write the background that they're from, but we need to address the fact that there aren't enough authors from Asian or minority ethnic backgrounds. ""Then we can see about exclusion across the board.""

"Avoiding meat and dairy products is one of the biggest ways to reduce your environmental impact, according to scientific studies. Switching to a plant-based diet can help fight climate change, according to a major report by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which says theWest's high consumption of meat and dairy is fuelling global warming. But what is the difference between beef and chicken? Does a bowl of rice produce more climate warming greenhouse gases than a plate of chips? Is wine more environmentally friendly than beer? To find out the climate impact of what you eat and drink, choose from one of the 34 items in our calculator and pick how often you have it. Don't cry because you can't play with our interactive.Update your browser to have a go! All figures for each food in the calculator are global averages. If you cannot view the food calculator,click to launch the interactive content,external. Design by Prina Shah, development by Felix Stephenson and Becky Rush. Food production is responsible for a quarter of all greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to global warming, according to aUniversity of Oxford study.,external However, the researchers found that the environmental impact of different foods varies hugely. Their findings showed that meat and other animal products are responsible for more than half of food-related greenhouse gas emissions, despite providing only a fifth of the calories we eat and drink. Of all the products analysed in the study, beef and lamb were found to have by far the most damaging effect on the environment. The findings echo recommendations on how individuals can lessen climate change by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). When it comes to our diets, the IPCC says we need to buy less meat, milk, cheese and butter - but also eat more locally sourced seasonal food, and throw less of it away. The IPCC also recommends that we insulate homes, take trains and buses instead of planes, and use video conferencing instead of business travel. Cutting meat and dairy products from your diet could reduce an individual's carbon footprint from food by two-thirds, according to the Oxford study, published in the journal Science. ""What we eat is one of the most powerful drivers behind most of the world's major environmental issues, whether it's climate change or biodiversity loss,"" study researcher Joseph Poore told BBC News. Changing your diet can make a big difference to your personal environmental footprint, from saving water to reducing pollution and the loss of forests, he said. ""It reduces the amount of land required to produce your food by about 75% - that's a huge reduction, particularly if you scale that up globally,"" Poore explained. If you fly regularly, replacing flying with other forms of transport may have a bigger impact on your carbon footprint than changing your diet. A passenger's carbon footprint from a one-way flight from London to New York is just under half a tonne of greenhouse gases. Switching from a regular petrol vehicle to an electric car could save more than double that over a year. Knowing how and where your food is produced is also important, as the same food can have huge differences in environmental impact. For example, beef cattle raised on deforested land is responsible for 12 times more greenhouse gas emissions than cows reared on natural pastures. The average beef from South America results in three times the amount of greenhouse gases as beef produced in Europe - and uses 10 times as much land. Meat and dairy are not the only foods where the choices you make can make a big difference. Chocolate and coffee originating from deforested rainforest produce relatively high greenhouse gases. For climate-friendly tomatoes, choose those grown outdoors or in high-tech greenhouses, instead of in greenhouses heated by gas or oil. Environmentally-minded beer-drinkers may be interested to know that draught beer is responsible for fewer emissions than recyclable cans, or worse, glass bottles. Even the most climate-friendly meat options still produce more greenhouse gases than vegetarian protein sources, like beans or nuts. Climate change: Where we are in seven charts Failure to tackle warming 'suicidal' Climate change is 'shrinking winter' University of Oxford researcher Joseph Poore, andThomas Nemecek of the Agroecology and Environment Research Division in Zurich, Switzerland,,externallooked at the environmental impact of 40 major food products that represent the vast majority of what is eaten globally. They assessed the effect of these foods on climate-warming greenhouse gas emissions and the amount of land and fresh water used across all stages of their production, including processing, packaging, and transportation, but excluding the cooking process. By analysing data from nearly 40,000 farms, 1,600 processors, packaging types and retailers, Poore and Nemecek were able to assess how different production practices and geographies have very different consequences on the planet. The data in the study looked at the environmental impact for 1kg of each of the different food products. For this story, these were converted to impact per serving sizes based onserving sizes from the British Dietetic Association (BDA),externalandhealthy diet portion sizes from BUPA,external. The figures for serving sizes based on the BDA and BUPA suggestions are oftenlower than portion sizes commonly found in restaurantsand what people normally expect, so the figures returned by the calculator on the impact of individuals' consumption are likely to be higher in reality. Protein-rich foods were calculated using the impact per 100g of protein from Poore and Nemecek's research and data on protein per serving from the BDA, to avoid differences between cooked and uncooked foods. The figures for greenhouse gas emissions are in kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2eq). This is a unit that converts the impact of different kinds of greenhouse gases, like methane and nitrous oxide, to the equivalent amount of carbon dioxide. The annual impact from eating a specific food is calculated by multiplying the impact of one serving of that food by the times it is eaten in a year, based on the weekly estimates submitted by the user. These are then compared with the emissions of other daily habits. TheEuropean Environment Agency,externalestimates that driving a regular petrol car produces 392g of CO2eq/mile over its entire lifecycle, including emissions from the vehicle's production, fuel production and exhaust emissions per mile. Heating the average UK home produces 2.34 tonnes of CO2eq annually, according to data from theCommittee on Climate Change,external, and a passenger's carbon footprint for a return flight from London to Malaga is 320kg CO2eq, based on 2018 figures from the Carbon Neutral Calculator. The Carbon Neutral Calculator is no longer online, but themethodology behind it can still be accessed,external. The land used to produce the annual consumption of each food is compared with the size of a double tennis court, 261 metres squared. The annual amount of water used is compared with a shower, based onfigures suggesting the average shower lasts eight minutes,externaland uses up 65 litres. Only ""blue water"", i.e. water taken out of rivers or the ground, is included in the data.
