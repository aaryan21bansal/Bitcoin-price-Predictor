"The chancellor is known by some around Westminster as ""box office Phil"", an ironic nickname for a politician who favours caution and prudence over showmanship and headline-grabbing pyrotechnics. So this should be Philip Hammond's sort ofBudget. The government is sticking with its aim of plugging the deficit and balancing the books. Although borrowing has fallen to its lowest level in a decade,the expected slowdown in productivity growthis likely to push future borrowing numbers back up, shrinking Mr Hammond's room to spend. Add in the economic uncertainty around Brexit, and Mr Hammond might be tempted to play safe and avoid any drama. There are political reasons for caution too. The Tories have a precarious working majority in the Commons with the help of the DUP, which means any remotely controversial votes on tax rises or spending cuts could easily be lost. Budget 2017: Everything you need to know Chancellor defends employment record Hammond: UK needs to get on with Brexit Who is the real Philip Hammond? Mr Hammond has already been burned from fumbling a Budget measure, whenhe had to scrap plans to raise National Insurance contributions for the self-employed within a week of announcing the policyin March. The chancellor does not revel in the political chess games enjoyed by his predecessor, George Osborne, who delighted in trying to outfox his opponents with a mischievous surprise. Not always successfully. Philip Hammond definitely does not need his own ""omnishambles"" Budget this week, and nor does the government. Badly wounded by the botched general election in June, hit by the departure of two cabinet ministers in a month, divided on Brexit, for the Tories this is a Budget that must not backfire. Laura Kuenssberg: Reshuffle maintains cabinet's Brexit balance Ironically, it was June's election that kept Philip Hammond in his job. There has been evidence of real tensions between the prime minister and her chancellor Hardly allowed out in public during the campaign, he was widely expected to be chopped after the expected victory - an impression Theresa May did nothing to dispel at a joint press conference with her chancellor in May. Tensions between Number 10 and Number 11 were clear and the source of the agro was of course Brexit. A supporter of Remain during the referendum, Mr Hammond has found himself battling the Brexiteers in the cabinet. He wants a two-year post-Brexit transition deal agreed with the EU as soon as possible to stop businesses moving out. He is resisting calls to set aside billions of pounds now for a no-deal scenario. Mr Hammond wants to protect financial services as much as possible. In October,the former Tory Chancellor Lord Lawson accused Mr Hammond of acting in a way that was ""close to sabotage"", because of his Brexit negativity, and urged Theresa May to sack him. But the prime minister, an Oxford university contemporary of her chancellor, shows no sign of wanting to move him. Former Chancellors can also be dangerous to a prime minister. Theresa May might recall the resignation speech of Geoffrey Howe in 1990 after he quit as Deputy Prime Minister, following a political career spent at the Treasury and the Foreign Office. This video can not be played Watch extracts of Geoffrey Howe's 1990 resignation speech, widely considered pivotal in Margaret Thatcher's downfall If you haven't seen it, his quietly deadly resignation speech is worth a few minutes of your time. So considering the constraints, what are Tory MPs hoping for from Wednesday's budget? ""Nobody is expecting much,"" one veteran of the Conservative back benches told me. While no fan of Philip Hammond, ""we don't want a bloodbath"", they said. ""We don't want him to screw it up,"" said another senior Tory, who is hoping for a sunnier message from the sometimes doleful Chancellor. The Tory MP Nigel Evans also says he wants a bit of cheer from Mr Hammond. ""If he comes to the despatch box and starts hand-wringing, and saying, 'We've got no money,' but at the same time we know they are prepared to up the amount of money they don't necessarily have to give the EU, then we'll all think, 'What the heck's going on?'"" The consistent view among Leave-supporting Tories is that they want him to sound upbeat about the possibilities of Brexit. But the chancellor has strong admirers on the Tory benches too, relieved he is in the Treasury's driving seat while the government argues about the final destination of Brexit. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has demanded ""an emergency Budget for our public services"", which he says are in crisis The MP for Chelmsford, Vicky Ford, is a fan. ""I want a chancellor who's as boring as anything, but really understands the numbers and the finances. I think Philip Hammond's been doing an incredibly good, detailed analysis and that's exactly what we need at this time."" Tory MPs agree it is a very difficult Budget for Philip Hammond to pitch. It needs to try to prove the government has a purpose other than Brexit, while having very little cash to splash. Maybe the chancellor will surprise us. The former schoolboy disco entrepreneur turned wealthy businessman took career risks long before he entered politics. But Wednesday will be one of his toughest challenges yet.

"The Scottish government has dismissed the chancellor's pledge of extra funding for Holyrood as a ""con"". Philip Hammond said moves in his Autumn Budget would ""mean Â£2bn more for the Scottish government"". But Scotland's finance secretary said Holyrood had been ""short changed"", and that funds for day to day spending would actually fall. Ministers have also traded barbs over plans to allow Scotland's police and fire services to claim VAT refunds. Mr Hammond took aim at ""SNP obstinacy"" over the issue, while the SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford accused the UK government of ""vindictiveness and nastiness"" for not having made the change sooner. Budget 2017: Live updates and reaction At-a-glance summary: Budget key points Sharp cut to UK growth forecast The disputed funds come in the form of Barnett consequentials, which are Scotland's share of additional spending in England which falls in areas of devolved competence - like health, education and housing. The Â£2bn cited by Mr Hammond is spread over the period from the current financial year through to 2020-21, and includes more than Â£1.1bn in financial transaction funding. This is capital funding for loan or equity initiatives, like ""help to buy"" schemes, meaning the government is constrained in how it is spent. Scotland's finance secretary, Derek Mackay - who will unveil his own draft budget in December - said it was ""money with strings attached"" which could not be spent ""directly on frontline public services"" and would eventually have to be repaid to the Treasury. He said the overall deal was ""disappointing"", telling the BBC's Politics Scotland programme that ""it's not a Â£2bn boost to Scotland, it's a con"". But Scottish Secretary David Mundell told the same programme there would be a ""significant increase in Scottish government spending"". On the capital funds, he said the Scottish government could ""use that money in innovative ways"", saying: ""The money is definitely available. It's for the Scottish government to come forward with the mechanisms that allow it to be used. ""Additional money is coming to Scotland and directly will benefit Scotland."" Derek Mackay said the claims of extra funding for Scotland were a ""con"" Mr Mackay also claimed the block grant for day to day spending was being cut in real terms, something refuted by the UK government. The Fraser of Allander Institute, an economic think tank based at the University of Strathclyde, said the extra funding for the resource budget amounted to ""around Â£350m"", saying it ""remains on track to be squeezed in real terms over the next two years"". Director Graeme Roy said: ""The challenge therefore remains for Derek Mackay as to how best to balance the resource budget with major commitments like additional support for the NHS, more money for childcare and public sector pay uplifts all to be paid for."" The other point of conflict between the governments is over VAT for the Scottish police and fire services, after Mr Hammond confirmed they would be eligible for refunds from April 2018. This brings Police Scotland and the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service into line with their counterparts elsewhere in the UK - but tax paid since the creation of the national forces will not be reimbursed. The two services pay about Â£35m a year in VAT - bringing the total bill since they were set up four years ago to Â£140m. Scottish ministers have repeatedly called on the UK government to end the ""glaring disparity"" in the way that VAT affects emergency services across the UK, pointing out that territorial police and fire services in England and Wales already get refunds on their VAT bills. Scotland's police and fire services pay about Â£35m a year in VAT The UK government says the Scottish government knew of the VAT implications before the police and fire service mergers were approved, but pressed on with them regardless. In his budget speech, Mr Hammond said he had been persuaded by Scottish Conservative MPs to make the change. He added: ""The SNP knew the rules, they knew the consequences of introducing these bodies, and they ploughed ahead anyway. ""But my Scottish Conservative colleagues have persuaded me that the Scottish people should not lose out just because of the obstinacy of the SNP government."" On spending, Mr Hammond trumpeted a ""boost"" for Scotland in the shape of Â£2bn extra. He said he had ""delivered for Scotland"". In response, Derek Mackay said it was a ""con"". The money was over four years (the Chancellor never disguised that) - and more than half of the dosh was in the form of financial transactions. These have caused contention in the past. They are, in essence, loan funds available for private projects such as housing, business or agriculture. They fall, thus, to be repaid. Scottish ministers readily concede that such funds have proved valuable in the past - although they tend, discreetly, to cite their own deftness in finding useful vehicles. But they say it is cash with strings and it leaves day-to-day spending on the NHS, education and the like facing a real-terms cut. At which point, Mr Mundell says that the total package going to Scotland will be helpful. At which pointâ¦..you get the concept. Read more from Brian here The chancellor also said progress was being made on city deals for Tay Cities and Stirling, and for a growth deal for Borderlands. And he said the government would introduce transferable tax history for oil and gas fields in the North Sea - which he described as an ""innovative tax policy that will encourage new entrants to bring fresh investment to a basin that still holds up to 20 billion barrels of oil"". Many of the measures announced by Mr Hammond - such as homebuyers no longer having to pay stamp duty for properties of up to Â£300,000 - will not apply in Scotland, where the tax is devolved and known as Land and Buildings Transaction Tax. It will be up to the Scottish government in its own forthcoming budget to decide whether to follow the chancellor's lead. In alengthy Twitter thread,external, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon welcomed the announcements on oil and gas, and on VAT. But she said both were ""overdue"", and that it was ""disappointing and unfair to emergency services"" that VAT that had already been paid would not be refunded. The chancellor said a freeze on spirit duty would benefit the Scotch whisky industry Among the other budget measures which the Treasury said would impact on Scotland were: A freeze on spirits duty, which it said would give distillers the confidence needed to invest and grow their businesses and encourage new firms to enter the market Fuel duty will be frozen, with support for islands extended Â£3.3m support for Scottish charities The chancellor said the budget was proof that the Conservative government was ""giving power back to the people of Britain and driving prosperity and greater fairness across our United Kingdom"". But he also said that the Office for Budget Responsibility had revised down forecasts for Britain's GDP to 1.5% in 2017, down from the 2% it had previously predicted. Scottish Labour's new leader, Richard Leonard, said Mr Hammond had ""delivered a failing budget, on a failing economy from a failing government"". He added: ""They are rudderless and without a plan to grow our economy, help our industries and create the work of the future. This Tory government is a driverless vehicle. This budget is insufficient, inadequate and insincere.""

"Millions of names, email addresses and mobile phone numbers were accessed Uber concealed a hack that affected 57 million customers and drivers, the company has confirmed. The 2016 breach was hidden by the ride-sharing firm which paid hackers $100,000 (Â£75,000) to delete the data. The company's former chief executive Travis Kalanick knew about the breach over a year ago,according to Bloomberg, which first broke the news,external. The hackers found 57 million names, email addresses and mobile phone numbers, Uber said. Within that number, 600,000 drivers had their names and licence details exposed.A resource page for those affected has been set up,external. Drivers have been offered free credit monitoring protection, but according to Uber's statement, affected customers will not be given the same. ""While we have not seen evidence of fraud or misuse tied to the incident, we are monitoring the affected accounts and have flagged them for additional fraud protection,"" Uber's chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi said. ""None of this should have happened, and I will not make excuses for it,"" he added. ""While I can't erase the past, I can commit on behalf of every Uber employee that we will learn from our mistakes."" In the wake of the news, Uber's chief security officer Joe Sullivan has left the company. The scandals that drove Travis Kalanick out Uber loses London licence to operate Uber: we are determined to make things right UK 'huge concerns' over Uber breach Uber did not confirm precise details of the hack - and it is not known which countries were affected - but according to Bloomberg's report, two hackers were able to access a private area of Github, an online resource for developers. From there it is understood they found Uber's log-in credentials to Amazon Web Services. AWS is a cloud computing service used by companies to store data. As is often the case, it will likely be the cover up that proves more bothersome for Uber than the hack itself. Companies are required to disclose significant data breaches to regulators, something it has by its own admission failed to do in this case. Uber has form. In January it was fined $20,000 for failing to disclose a considerably less serious breach in 2014. Analysis by BBC Business Managing Uber appears to be like a game of Whac-A-Mole - no sooner has one crisis been dealt with when another one rears its ugly head. This latest scandal, however, threatens to tear apart an already fragile truce between Uber's former chief executive Travis Kalanick and Benchmark, the shareholder that trounced him from the top job then tried to kick him off the board. These two managed to park their hostilities in order that an investment by Japanese conglomerate Softbank - thought to be worth up to $10bn - would go ahead. But the fact that Uber concealed a massive data breach, which Mr Kalanick knew about a year ago, will do nothing to help matters. Softbank's investment is significant for Uber because it will result in a significant reform of its board and help the business improve its corporate governance, something that desperately needs to be overhauled. Uber's new chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi appears to be starting as he means to go on. In his statement regarding the data breach, he said the company needed to be open and honest if is to ""repair our past mistakes"". Rajeev Misra, a board director at Softbank, described progress on a deal with Uber as ""long and arduous"". With Uber's latest problems, it may become a whole lot tougher.

"This video can not be played DUP leader attacks EU over Brexit talks Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar ""should know better"" than to ""play around"" with Northern Ireland over Brexit, the leader of the Democratic Unionist Party says. Arlene Foster accused Mr Varadkar of being ""reckless"" as Brexit talks enter a ""critical phase"". She was speaking after meeting Theresa May at Downing Street. The Irish government says any hard border with Northern Ireland should be off the table. And an EU paper recently suggested Northern Ireland would have to continue to follow many EU rules after Brexit if a hard border was to be avoided. It hinted Northern Ireland may need to stay in the EU customs union if there were to be no checks at the border. Barnier challenges UK on border plans Sinn FÃ©in 'glorifying murder', says DUP Stormont deadlock: What you need to know That is something which the UK Conservative government - which is supported in key votes by the DUP at Westminster - have said they cannot accept as it would effectively create a border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. The Irish government has said it will veto the start of Brexit trade talks unless border issues are concerned By the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg While there are genuine and sincerely held logistical and understandable concerns about what happens to the Irish border after Brexit, there is a sense building that perhaps the Irish government is playing those concerns rather harder than is justified. DUP leader Arlene Foster, using rather strong language, told off the Irish leader Leo Varadkar for doing just that today. But the next step in what many would say is a conspiracy theory, borne out of Brexiteer desperation, is to ponder whether the EU as a whole is over-egging their true level of worry about what happens to the border. Brexit and the Irish border: Is all as it seems? Speaking to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg, Mrs Foster said: ""Some people are taking their moment in the sun, to try and get the maximum in relation to the negotiations - and I understand that but you shouldn't play about with Northern Ireland particularly at a time when we're trying to bring about devolved government again."" She said that suggesting leaving the EU would jeopardise the peace process was ""a very careless thing to say"", particularly with no devolved administration in place, and accused Ireland's government of being ""reckless"". Mrs Foster said she recognised Brexit was a ""big shock"" for the Republic of Ireland - ""and they are trying to process all of that"". ""But they certainly shouldn't be using Northern Ireland to get the maximum deal for their citizens."" All you need to know about Brexit UK government wants an 'unprecedented solution' for the Irish border Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that will share a land border with an EU state post-Brexit, and what happens to the border is one of the key subjects being debated between the EU and the UK. Key to this is how to avoid customs checks on the border when the UK leaves the EU's customs union - the arrangement that allows goods to flow freely between member states. Negotiations have yet to make a breakthrough so the EU says talks on future matters like trade and customs cannot begin yet. But Mrs Foster said it was crucial to move on to the second phase now because the trade arrangement is linked to the border situation. The DUP pledged in June to support Theresa May's minority government over Brexit and other core issues as part of a parliamentary pact due to last at least two years. But Nigel Dodds, the party's deputy leader, has warned that any prospect of the border moving to the Irish Sea after Brexit - an idea suggested by some within the Irish government - would be ""gravely destabilising"" to the UK government.

"Charlie Rose, 75, is one of America's most respected broadcasters US TV host Charlie Rose has been fired by CBS News following sexual harassment allegations. An email to staff said the presenter's employment had been ""terminated... effective immediately"". It said the move followed the revelation of ""extremely disturbing and intolerable behaviour"" said to have taken place around his programme. Eight women accused the veteran TV interviewer of inappropriate behaviourin a report by the Washington Post,external. Following the allegations he was suspended by CBS, PBS and Bloomberg. Rose co-hosted the CBS This Morning show and was a correspondent for its Sunday night news magazine 60 Minutes. He appeared on PBS and Bloomberg with the Charlie Rose show. Rose apologised following the Washington Post story, but said not all the claims were accurate. The allegations span from the 1990s to 2011 and include groping, lewd telephone calls and unwanted advances. How 'MeToo' is exposing the scale of sexual abuse Harassment in Hollywood: Who's been accused? What to do if you're being sexually harassed at work The internal email to staff from CBS News president David Rhodes read: ""Despite Charlie's important journalistic contribution to our news division, there is absolutely nothing more important, in this or any organisation, than ensuring a safe, professional workplace - a supportive environment where people feel they can do their best work. We need to be such a place. ""I've often heard that things used to be different.  And no-one may be able to correct the past. But what may once have been accepted should not ever have been acceptable."" Rose, 75, is one of America's most respected broadcasters and his interviews have won him Emmy and Peabody awards. He was named by Time magazine as one of its 100 most influential people in 2014. He is known for conducting in-depth interviews, including with such high-profile guests as former President Barack Obama, talk show host Oprah Winfrey and billionaire Warren Buffett, on his eponymous television programme which first aired in 1991. Charlie Rose's interviews have won him several awards In recent weeks, numerous high-profile figures, including Oscar-winning actors and a Hollywood filmmaker, have been accused of sexual harassment. The accusations were sparked bymultiple women speaking out against the Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein, and a subsequent campaign encouraging victims to share their stories of sexual harassment under the #metoo hashtag.

"This video can not be played Dr Mark Vanderpump told the BBC patients were seeing liothyronine sold for Â£5 in other European cities Drug company Concordia overcharged the NHS by millions for a key thyroid treatment, the Competition and Markets Authority has provisionally found. The CMA said that last year the NHS spent Â£34m,externalon its drug, liothyronine, up from about Â£600,000 in 2006. The amount the NHS paid per pack rose from around Â£4.46 in 2007 to Â£258.19 by July 2017, an increase of almost 6,000%. Concordia said,externalit did ""not believe that competition law has been infringed"". The price change occurred in the years after the drug was de-branded in 2007. The CMA said the price rise took place despite ""broadly stable"" production costs. Canadian drugs giant Concordia sells drugs to patients in more than 100 countries. Liothyronine tablets are primarily used to treat hypothyroidism, a condition caused by a deficiency of thyroid hormone affecting at least two in every 100 people and which can lead to depression, tiredness and weight gain. Until earlier this year, Concordia was the only supplier of the drug. CMA chief executive, Andrea Coscelli, said: ""Pharmaceutical companies which abuse their position and overcharge for drugs are forcing the NHS - and the UK taxpayer - to pay over the odds for important medical treatments. ""We allege that Concordia used its market dominance in the supply of liothyronine tablets to do exactly that."" Prescription medicines that are still under patent can be expensive, but the government caps profits from any that are sold to the NHS to keep costs low. But this system does not cover so-called ""generic medicines"", where a drug's patent has run out. The loophole means the price of older, established drugs coming off patent can rocket. A company, after filing and obtaining appropriate approval, can start trading the rebranded medicine and set a high price for it through a process known as ""debranding"". It's something the Competition and Markets Authority has challenged a number of drugs companies over. Mr Coscelli stressed that, at this stage in the investigation, the findings were provisional and there had been no definitive decision that there had been a breach of competition law. Concordia said the pricing of liothyronine had been conducted ""openly and transparently with the Department of Health in the UK over a period of 10 years"". ""Over that time, significant investment has been made in this medicine to ensure its continued availability for patients in the UK. ""We continue to work co-operatively with the CMA as it proceeds with its investigation."" It added that the CMA's statement included matters that pre-dated Concordia's ownership of its international segment, which it bought in 2015 from investment firm Cinven and other sellers, including Hg Capital. The CMA has also written to those two firms. Before she started taking liothyronine, Tara Riddle said her life was ""utter, utter exhaustion"". She told BBC 5 live: ""I had to lean on something, rather than stand, I couldn't go out, I couldn't shop. It was awful, absolutely awful."" Having researched her condition online she convinced her GP to prescribe her liothyronine which she took for four weeks. ""My life came back completely,"" she said. ""Then I called my GP and he said 'I am so, so glad, but I'm afraid I am not allowed to to give you any more because they are so expensive.'"" Tara is now forced to buy the drug overseas via the internet. She said: ""I get some from Greece, some from Mexico. I talked to my MP about it and he said they could be dirty drugs, and I said I know, but I said I wasn't going to go back to that bad place I was in. ""The NHS is paying around Â£900 for 100 tablets, and in Greece and Turkey they can be got for about Â£3. The NHS is paying way, way too much and there's something wrong."" An NHS England spokesperson said: ""This action sends an important enforcement signal to relevant generic drug manufacturers, and also wholesalers, that taxpayers and the NHS will not tolerate market abuses."" Dr Mark Vanderpump, former president of the British Thyroid Association, explained how he saw the cost of liothyronine rocket: ""Historically the drug cost the NHS about Â£20-30 a month. The new cost was over Â£300 a month. ""Patients were telling me they could go to a foreign capital and pay about Â£4-5 a month, so there was a massive difference in what the NHS was being charged versus what people were accessing it at at a European level."" If the provisional finding is upheld the CMA can impose a fine of up to 10% of Concordia's annual worldwide turnover. Earlier this year, Concordia was also accused of pushing up the price of a ""lifesaving"" NHS drug by striking a deal not to compete with another firm. The CMAsaid in provisional findings,externalthat Actavis and Concordia fixed the market for hydrocortisone tablets. Concordia also said then it did not think it was in breach of competition law. The CMA said the liothyronine case was one of a number it was looking at within the pharmaceutical sector. Previously, the watchdog has fined drugs giant Pfizer and Flynn Pharma nearly Â£90m in relation to what it called ""excessive and unfair prices"" for the anti-epilepsy treatment, phenytoin sodium capsules. It also fined a number of pharmaceutical companies a total of Â£45m in relation to anti-depressant medicine paroxetine. Both those decisions are under appeal. The CMA is pursuing another seven investigations into several companies in relation to drug pricing and competition issues.

"Faiz Siddiqui is suing Oxford university for Â£1m in damages An Oxford graduate's failure to get a top degree cost him a lucrative legal career, the High Court has heard. Faiz Siddiqui alleges ""inadequate"" teaching on his modern history course resulted in him getting an upper second degree in June 2000. He blames staff being absent on sabbatical leave and is suing the university for Â£1m. Oxford denies negligence and causation and says the case is ""massively"" outside the legal time limit. Mr Siddiqui also alleges medical information about him was not submitted to examiners by a tutor. The 39-year-old studied at Brasenose College and singled out the teaching on the Indian special subject part of his course for criticism. Julian Milford, for Oxford University, told the court Mr Siddiqui described the teaching as ""a little bit dull"" His counsel Roger Mallalieu told Mr Justice Foskett that Mr Siddiqui had been a ""driven young man"" aiming at a postgraduate qualification at an Ivy League university. He said: ""Whilst a 2:1 degree from Oxford might rightly seem like a tremendous achievement to most, it fell significantly short of Mr Siddiqui's expectations and was, to him, a huge disappointment."" Mr Mallalieu said his employment history in legal and tax roles was ""frankly poor"" and he was now unemployed, rather than having a career at the tax bar in England or a major US law firm. Mr Siddiqui also said his clinical depression and insomnia have been significantly exacerbated by his ""inexplicable failure"". Julian Milford, for Oxford University, told the court Mr Siddiqui complained about insufficient resources, but had only described the teaching as ""a little bit dull"". He added the student received exactly the same amount of teaching as he would have in any other year. The seven-day hearing is concerned only with liability - with damages to be assessed later if Mr Siddiqui succeeds.

"The process of using divining rod has been in use for hundreds of years Water companies are using divining rods to find underground pipes despite there being no scientific evidence they work, an Oxford University scientist found. Sally Le Page said her parents were surprised when a technician used two ""bent tent pegs"" to find a mains pipe. She contacted all the UK's water companies,external, and a majority confirmed engineers still use the centuries-old technique. However, a number said the equipment was not standard-issue equipment. The process of using divining rods, also known as dowsing, has been in use for hundreds of years. A dowser will typically hold the rods, usually shaped like the letter Y, while walking over land and being alert for any movement to find water. Evolutionary biologist Ms Le Page, whose parents live in Stratford-upon-Avon,first contacted Severn Trent Water via Twitter,external. It replied: ""We've found that some of the older methods are just as effective than the new ones, but we do use drones as well, and now satellites."" Other companies which gave a similar response were: Anglian Water Thames Water Scottish Water Southern Water Welsh Water United Utilities Yorkshire Water Ms Le Page said: ""I can't state this enough: there is no scientifically rigorous, doubly blind evidence that divining rods work. ""Isn't it a bit silly that big companies are still using magic to do their jobs?"" In a statement issued later, Severn Trent said: ""We don't issue divining rods but we believe some of our engineers use them."" All the companies emphasised they do not encourage the use of divining rods nor issue them to engineers, and said modern methods such as drones and listening devices were preferred. Northern Ireland Water, Northumbrian Water, South West Water and Wessex Water said their engineers do not use them.

"The school said the forum would not be studying Mein Kampf but incorporating it within ""wider debate"" A school has defended plans encouraging students to debate controversial ideologies and texts such as Hitler's Mein Kampf. Simon Langton Grammar School in Canterbury said the optional course called The Unsafe Space would be ""the antidote to political correctness"". The National Education Union (NEU) in Kent has urged caution and some students have expressed concern. But the school said the negative reaction was ""scandal-mongering"". In a letter to parents, the school said the seminars would be ""a vehicle for freedom of speech"". It said they would challenge pupils to ""think oppositely"" and consider ""manifestos to change the world"". Christine Dickinson, secretary of the Kent section of the NEU (formerly the National Union of Teachers), said: ""There are many uncomfortable subjects that have to be discussed in school but the school must be very careful about the way that they approach it."" Dr James Soderholm, running the course, said: ""To examine a text is not to peddle its propaganda or fall in league with its message... it is to lay bare that ideology for inspection."" He branded the suggestion that a teacher might use Mein Kampf as a ""recipe book for anti-Semitism"" as ""scandal-mongering"". Dr Soderholm added that anyone who did not understand was ""wilfully ignorant or doesn't understand the first thing about good teaching"".

"This video can not be played The chancellor abolishes stamp duty on homes under Â£300,000 to help first-time buyers. Chancellor Philip Hammond has given a sobering assessment of the economy, saying it is expected to grow more slowly than previously thought. But he sought to rally Conservative MPs in his Budget by scrapping stamp duty for the first Â£300,000 spent by first-time buyers, a saving of up to Â£5,000. The cut will apply to buyers in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Mr Hammond also promised Â£1.5bn to ""address concerns"" about the flagship universal credit scheme. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the government had a ""record of failure"". Key points at-a-glance: A Budget summary Budget Live: Rolling text and video updates What the Budget 2017 means for you In depth: The BBC's Budget coverage At the start of his speech, Mr Hammond struck a positive note, saying the economy continued to ""confound those who seek to talk it down"" by creating jobs and continuing to grow. But he then said productivity levels remained ""stubbornly flat"" with growth until 2021 expected to be lower than predicted in March. It is the first time in a generation that growth is forecast to grow below 2% every year. Mr Hammond's statement came with him under pressure from Eurosceptic Tory MPs and others calling for more spending to ease austerity. The chancellor - who has been accused of being too pessimistic about life outside the EU - said Â£3bn would be spent on Brexit planning, and that the government would prepare for ""every possible outcome"" Freezing alcohol duty apart from an increase in duty on high-strength white ciders The price of 20 cigarettes goes up by 28p and by 41p for 30g of rolling tobacco A promise to fund a pay rise for nurses if one is recommended by an independent panel Refunds onVAT for Scottish emergency services A one-offtax on new diesel carsthat do not meet latest emissions standards Â£28m for Kensington and Chelsea council for counselling and regeneration in the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower fire Bringing forward a plannedcut in business rate risesby two years to 2018 An extraÂ£2.8bn for the NHSin England up to 2022 Support for electric cars including a Â£400m charging infrastructure fund Anew railcardoffering discounts to those aged between 26 and 30 Housing had been billed as one of the key themes of the Budget - and the chancellor promised the ""next generation"" that getting on the housing ladder would not be just a ""dream"". Promising the government would deliver 300,000 new homes a year, he pledged Â£44bn capital investment and measures aimed at getting building projects started. And towards the end of his speech he made the pledge on stamp duty, which is paid by people buying properties over a certain value. Rates vary across the UK - in England, Wales and Northern Ireland it kicks in at Â£125,000 - and in Scotland, which has its own devolved tax - at Â£145,000. The cut will only operate in Wales until the matter is devolved next April and stamp duty replaced by a land transaction tax. Mr Hammond said his change would benefit 95% of first-time buyers. But in its assessment, the Office for Budget Responsibility said the main gainers would be those who already own a home. It also said it would lead to higher house prices and predicted it would only lead to an extra 3,500 first-time buyer purchases. Among the Â£44bn package was a pledge to make it easier for councils to build in areas of high housing need. There was also a threat to intervene with compulsory purchase orders if landowners and developers were found to be holding back on building ""for commercial rather than technical reasons"". Mr Hammond said investing more money alone would simply inflate prices and make matters worse. He added: ""Solving the housing challenge takes more than money, it takes planning reform. We will focus on the urban areas where people want to live... building high quality, high density homes."" As well as spending announcements, the chancellor also uses his Budget to update MPs on the state of the economy. And they cast a shadow on his other announcements, with the Office for Budget Responsibility predicting the economy would grow by 1.5% this year, down from the estimate of 2% it made in March. Growth, it says, will drop to 1.3% by 2020 and then rise to 1.5% in 2021, lower in every year than was predicted in March. Borrowing was predicted to be Â£8.4bn lower than in March, but long-term deficit predictions were hiked to Â£34.7bn in 2019, going down to Â£30.1bn in 2021. Mr Hammond said he was still on track to hit his target to balance the nation's books by the middle of the next decade. Sharp cut to UK growth forecast Another high-profile announcement was on universal credit, which is the government's major reform to the way benefits are paid and is currently being rolled out across the UK. Campaigners and MPs in all parties have been calling for changes to the way it is managed. The Â£1.5bn will remove a mandatory seven-day wait after someone submits a claim, taking the overall wait down from six weeks to five. Mr Hammond also said it would become  easier for claimants to receive an advance. Reality Check: What do Universal Credit reforms mean? This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""So much for tackling injustices"" Responding in the Commons, Mr Corbyn predicted the Budget would unravel, warning ""misery"" will continue for people across the country. He cited falling wages and added that economic growth in the first three quarters of this year was the lowest since 2009. The Labour leader also noted the lack of major social care policies in Mr Hammond's statement. And he reacted angrily to a heckle from the Tory benches as he said elderly people were not receiving good enough care. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Conservative and unionist MPs want a ""statute of limitations"" to prevent security force members being prosecuted for offences early in the Troubles Sinn FÃ©in's Gerry Adams has expressed concern about a proposed ""amnesty for British crown forces"" allegedly involved in Troubles' offences. Mr Adams said there had been a change to legacy arrangements envisaged under a previous political agreement. He was speaking after meeting Prime Minister Theresa May. Conservative and unionist MPs want a ""statute of limitations"" to prevent security force members being prosecuted for offences early in the Troubles. DUP's Foster warns Irish PM over Brexit Is Sinn FÃ©in leadership a one-horse race? Profile: Gerry Adams Brexit: All you need to know Gerry Adams held talks with Theresa May on Tuesday Mr Adams, the outgoing Sinn FÃ©in leader, said he understood a new section had been added to the 2014Stormont House Agreementand that it was ""about an amnesty for British crown forces"" - the term republicans to describe the Army and police. ""That is an act of bad faith, we weren't told this, we understand the Irish government weren't told this,"" Mr Adams said. ""So how on earth can a British prime minister hope to persuade anybody that there's a possibility of a new dispensation emerging when she takes up this position and her secretary of state takes up this position also?"" A government source told the BBC that their preferred approach remained the proposals set out under the Stormont House Agreement, but that the government wanted, in their consultation, to ask the public what they thought about a statute of limitations. The Irish government said it would ""not look favourably"" on any amnesty measure in Northern Ireland. ""There are no amnesties from prosecution provided for in the Good Friday Agreement or any subsequent agreements including the Stormont House Agreement,""  a spokesman for the Department of Foreign Affairs said. Earlier, the DUP said Sinn FÃ©in must stop glorifying the murders of innocent people. DUP leader Arlene Foster said remarks made about IRA terrorism at Sinn Fein's annual gathering were 'quite disgraceful' Speaking after a separate meeting with Mrs May, DUP leader Arlene Foster said remarks made about IRA terrorism at Sinn FÃ©in's annual gathering were ""quite disgraceful"". She said the DUP would continue to work towards the restoration of devolution. Mr Adams, however, rejected Mrs Foster's allegations, saying they were an excuse not to strike a deal. The Sinn FÃ©in president was accompanied to the Downing Street talks by the party's leader north of the border, Michelle O'Neill, and its vice president, Mary-Lou McDonald. Northern Ireland has been without a devolved administration since January, when the governing parties - the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in -split in a bitter row over a botched green energy scheme. At the Sinn FÃ©in gathering (ard fheis) in Dublin at the weekend, tributes were paid to the late Martin McGuinness. Sinn FÃ©in was viewed as the political wing of the IRA during the Troubles. Party members regularly attend commemorations for IRA members. The Provisional IRA killed almost 1,800 people during its campaign, about 650 of those were civilians. Tributes were paid to the late Martin McGuinness at the Sinn FÃ©in party conference at the weekend One of the loudest cheers of the conference came when delegates were told that the former Stormont deputy first minister, Mr McGuinness, had been a ""proud member of the IRA"". Mrs Foster said she had told Mrs May the glorification of terrorism made the restoration of power sharing in Northern Ireland more difficult. She said the DUP was talking about a deal to restore power sharing that both unionism and nationalism could live with, but she accused Sinn FÃ©in of only being concerned with nationalism. She also criticised calls from Sinn FÃ©in for more direct involvement by both the London and Dublin governments over the political stalemate at Stormont - saying the internal governance of Northern Ireland was a matter for the UK government. The Sinn FÃ©in delegation had been expected to tell Theresa May that instead of direct rule, the British and Irish governments should deliver on equality issues like same-sex marriage and an Irish Language Act. But DUP MP Nigel Dodds was scathing about Sinn FÃ©in's complaints about equal rights. Michelle O'Neill and Gerry Adams are expected to press the government on same-sex marriage and an Irish language act ""When Sinn FÃ©in lectures everybody about rights, remember that the greatest right of all is the right to life,"" said Mr Dodds, who met the prime minister with Mrs Foster. ""It is not just that Sinn FÃ©in have supported IRA terrorism in the past, and the murder of innocent people, but even at the weekend they were continuing to eulogise and glorify the murder of innocent people. ""In a rights-based society, that has got to stop,"" he added. Mrs May said it was clear the issues dividing the parties are relatively small in number, focusing mainly around culture, legacy, identity and the future stability of the devolved institutions. ""While not in any way underestimating the challenges involved, I believe that a way forward can be found and an agreement reached,"" she said. Sinn FÃ©in has called for a British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference to be convened to consider a way forward, but Mrs Foster described that body as a ""talking shop which has not met since 2007"". She said Northern Ireland must not be used as a pawn in ongoing Brexit negotiations, accusing some in Dublin and Brussels of trying torecklessly use Northern Ireland for their own objectives. Sinn FÃ©in said the confidence and supply arrangement between the DUP and the Conservative Party had ""compounded"" the problems the parties faced.

"What a way to start the week - settling down to watch one of the major events of the year that affects your finances. In his speech, the chancellor will announce the government's plans for tax and spending for the financial year which starts in April 2019. Here is your essential guide. It is on Monday, 29 October, at about 15:30 GMT. Three aspects of the timing are relatively unusual. Firstly, it is earlier in the year than usual to avoid clashing with the final stage of Brexit negotiations in November. Five things to watch for in the Budget Philip Hammond prepares last Budget before Brexit Secondly, the Budget is being presented on a Monday, normally it is revealed on a Wednesday after Prime Minister's Questions. This year that would mean it would fall on Halloween - a gift to headline writers - although the government denies that was a factor in choosing the day. Thirdly, the Chancellor will start his speech at about 15:30 GMT, three hours later than usual. That's because Parliamentary business starts later on a Monday because MPs have to travel to London from their constituencies. The speech usually lasts about an hour, although the longest continuous Budget speech was by William Gladstone in 1853, lasting four hours and 45 minutes. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn then gets the first response, before MPs debate the Budget. Arguably, the second most powerful person in government, behind the Prime Minister. He was appointed as chancellor - known in many countries as the finance minister - in July 2016. Philip Hammond (right) has not got much spare cash (left) to spend Mr Hammond entered Parliament at the relatively late age of 41 as a millionaire. He has been the Conservative MP for Runnymede and Weybridge since 1997. He has been dubbed ""Spreadsheet Phil"" owing to his love of numbers, including running over finances while on the beach on holiday. No. Many powers, as well as some tax issues, are devolved to the nations of the UK. Expect more on those in the coming weeks. One big announcement will be the Scottish government's intentions on income tax levels, to be outlined at its Budget on 12 December. The Budget comes hot on the heels of the Conservative Party conference, during which Prime Minister Theresa May claimed that austerity is coming to an end. ""The British people need to know that the end is in sight,"" she said. That could be rather restrictive for Mr Hammond, who needs to raise extra money somehow. The government has committed to finding an extra Â£20bn for the NHS by 2023. Ministers have indicated it will be partly funded by tax rises, so all eyes are on the chancellor for a solution. Mrs May also said that the borrowing cap for local councils wanting to build new homes will be scrapped, potentially adding to the national debt. As usual, there have been a host of Treasury announcements in the run-up to the speech ranging from potholes to interest-free loans. Of course. This is the final Budget when the UK is part of the European Union, so how the economy is prepared for the UK's exit will clearly be a significant, and closely watched, part of the speech. Arguably, the nature of any deal struck with the EU - or the failure to reach any kind of deal - would have a much bigger impact on the nation's finances than anything Mr Hammond says in the Budget. The chancellor has already said a new Budget would be needed if the UK and the EU cannot agree a Brexit deal. The Chancellor sets the so-called ""sin taxes"" on cigarettes and booze. So, at the end of Budget day, any change in these duties will come into effect and is likely to have an immediate impact on prices. The Chancellor has special permission to drink alcohol during the speech, although the last one to do so was Kenneth Clarke, who had a whisky. In her party conference speech, Mrs May scotched speculation that fuel duty could go up for the first time in nearly a decade, saying she was extending the duty freeze for a ninth year in a row, a move costing the Exchequer Â£800m. That said, petrol prices are relatively high, so drivers are already feeling the pinch. There is some speculation that the level of income at which workers pay income tax could be frozen, despite a Conservative pledge at the 2017 election that the thresholds would rise to Â£12,500 by 2020. The starting point for the higher rate of tax was also pledged to rise to Â£50,000 by 2020. Many working-age benefits are nearly three years through a four-year freeze. These include Jobseeker's Allowance, Employment and Support Allowance, some types of Housing Benefit, and Child Benefit. The cap on public sector pay rises in England and Wales has been in place in some form since 2010, although there is nowsome flexibility in pay awards for public servants. The cap has effectively been lifted, with more significant pay rises for police, NHS workers and others. However, these increases have needed to come from departmental budgets so a squeeze on funding still exists. The real detail on all of these plans, and how much they will cost or save, is in the Budget red book - a fat document published as soon as the chancellor has sat down after his speech. At about the same time next year. If you cannot wait that long, then there is the spring statement, usually in late February or early March, which updates the state of the nation's finances. There is always the chance of a mini-Budget, or a major financial statement of some kind, if and when a Brexit deal is announced.

"With no ministers in place, civil servants have been making the decisions on running public services There have been a year's headlines about deadlines to restore power-sharing in Northern Ireland. It has been without an executive since January 2017, when the governing parties - the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in -split in a bitter row. Northern Ireland's biggest political crisis for more than a decade has left Stormont in limbo. The latest round of talks began at Stormont on 24 January. Head of the NI Civil Service David Sterling has said there needs to be clarity about a budget by 8 February. Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley is to update the House of Commons on progress later this week. Ms Bradley was appointed Secretary of State in Januaryafter theresignation of James Brokenshiredue to health reasons. So, what are the chances of settlement any time soon, and what will happen if the parties can only agree to disagree? It has been a long year in Northern Ireland politics. In a strange sort of way, a lot has changed while much has stayed the same. The first of two elections saw Sinn FÃ©in strengthen its hand in the Northern Ireland Assembly in March, while the DUP did the same in the House of Commons after June's Westminster poll. But in spite of days, weeks and months of talks, the relationship between the two powerhouses has remained a cold one. In November, when some informed onlookers were predicting that a deal between the two parties was close, the prospect was punctured again. With the talks collapsing again, Mr Brokenshire moved to introduce a budget bill to keep money flowing into Northern Ireland's public services. In December, an official review of MLAs' salaries recommended a 13% pay cut. Talks resumed in late January, with Ms Bradley declaring that ""time is short"" but saying there was one last opportunity to restore the executive. While some of the issues that led to the demise of the Stormont institutions appear to have been resolved, or at least lessened in significance for either party, the split remains as wide as ever on others. Take the big sticking point ofSinn FÃ©in's demand for legislation to give official status to the Irish languagein Northern Ireland. Sinn FÃ©in wants an Irish language act but the DUP is opposed to that demand The party has been frank and forthright in its insistence that Stormont won't get up and running again until a standalone act to allow that is agreed. The DUP has made moves to open itself to the Irish language, meeting campaign groups and leaderArlene Foster even publicly spoke a few words of it. But its suggestion of a culture bill, encompassing legislation for Irish and Ulster Scots, falls short of what Sinn FÃ©in wants. Other issues, including rights for same-sex couples to marry and measures to deal with investigations into killings during the Troubles, also feature high on the talks agenda. With no ministers in place at Stormont, civil servants have been making the day-to-day calls on running public services, but their hands are largely tied. Major decisions - many involving hundreds of thousands or even millions of pounds of public money - need to be approved by an executive. Karen Bradley has said there is one last opportunity to restore the executive Take the reform of Northern Ireland's health service as one example. With the system at breaking point, an ambitious plan was unveiled almost exactly 12 months ago. But with no health minister and no executive in place, no changes can be implemented and the difficulties remain. That's one way of putting it. Business leaders, public service workers, those relying on the health service and many others have voiced their frustration and anger about the situation at Stormont. If power were to transfer to Westminster, the Conservative government would make the big decisions in areas such as health, education and justice. The pressure has increased steadily on the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in the longer their stalemate has gone on. The question remains - is either side ready to make the compromises required to do a deal?

"The chancellor is known by some around Westminster as ""box office Phil"", an ironic nickname for a politician who favours caution and prudence over showmanship and headline-grabbing pyrotechnics. So this should be Philip Hammond's sort ofBudget. The government is sticking with its aim of plugging the deficit and balancing the books. Although borrowing has fallen to its lowest level in a decade,the expected slowdown in productivity growthis likely to push future borrowing numbers back up, shrinking Mr Hammond's room to spend. Add in the economic uncertainty around Brexit, and Mr Hammond might be tempted to play safe and avoid any drama. There are political reasons for caution too. The Tories have a precarious working majority in the Commons with the help of the DUP, which means any remotely controversial votes on tax rises or spending cuts could easily be lost. Budget 2017: Everything you need to know Chancellor defends employment record Hammond: UK needs to get on with Brexit Who is the real Philip Hammond? Mr Hammond has already been burned from fumbling a Budget measure, whenhe had to scrap plans to raise National Insurance contributions for the self-employed within a week of announcing the policyin March. The chancellor does not revel in the political chess games enjoyed by his predecessor, George Osborne, who delighted in trying to outfox his opponents with a mischievous surprise. Not always successfully. Philip Hammond definitely does not need his own ""omnishambles"" Budget this week, and nor does the government. Badly wounded by the botched general election in June, hit by the departure of two cabinet ministers in a month, divided on Brexit, for the Tories this is a Budget that must not backfire. Laura Kuenssberg: Reshuffle maintains cabinet's Brexit balance Ironically, it was June's election that kept Philip Hammond in his job. There has been evidence of real tensions between the prime minister and her chancellor Hardly allowed out in public during the campaign, he was widely expected to be chopped after the expected victory - an impression Theresa May did nothing to dispel at a joint press conference with her chancellor in May. Tensions between Number 10 and Number 11 were clear and the source of the agro was of course Brexit. A supporter of Remain during the referendum, Mr Hammond has found himself battling the Brexiteers in the cabinet. He wants a two-year post-Brexit transition deal agreed with the EU as soon as possible to stop businesses moving out. He is resisting calls to set aside billions of pounds now for a no-deal scenario. Mr Hammond wants to protect financial services as much as possible. In October,the former Tory Chancellor Lord Lawson accused Mr Hammond of acting in a way that was ""close to sabotage"", because of his Brexit negativity, and urged Theresa May to sack him. But the prime minister, an Oxford university contemporary of her chancellor, shows no sign of wanting to move him. Former Chancellors can also be dangerous to a prime minister. Theresa May might recall the resignation speech of Geoffrey Howe in 1990 after he quit as Deputy Prime Minister, following a political career spent at the Treasury and the Foreign Office. This video can not be played Watch extracts of Geoffrey Howe's 1990 resignation speech, widely considered pivotal in Margaret Thatcher's downfall If you haven't seen it, his quietly deadly resignation speech is worth a few minutes of your time. So considering the constraints, what are Tory MPs hoping for from Wednesday's budget? ""Nobody is expecting much,"" one veteran of the Conservative back benches told me. While no fan of Philip Hammond, ""we don't want a bloodbath"", they said. ""We don't want him to screw it up,"" said another senior Tory, who is hoping for a sunnier message from the sometimes doleful Chancellor. The Tory MP Nigel Evans also says he wants a bit of cheer from Mr Hammond. ""If he comes to the despatch box and starts hand-wringing, and saying, 'We've got no money,' but at the same time we know they are prepared to up the amount of money they don't necessarily have to give the EU, then we'll all think, 'What the heck's going on?'"" The consistent view among Leave-supporting Tories is that they want him to sound upbeat about the possibilities of Brexit. But the chancellor has strong admirers on the Tory benches too, relieved he is in the Treasury's driving seat while the government argues about the final destination of Brexit. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has demanded ""an emergency Budget for our public services"", which he says are in crisis The MP for Chelmsford, Vicky Ford, is a fan. ""I want a chancellor who's as boring as anything, but really understands the numbers and the finances. I think Philip Hammond's been doing an incredibly good, detailed analysis and that's exactly what we need at this time."" Tory MPs agree it is a very difficult Budget for Philip Hammond to pitch. It needs to try to prove the government has a purpose other than Brexit, while having very little cash to splash. Maybe the chancellor will surprise us. The former schoolboy disco entrepreneur turned wealthy businessman took career risks long before he entered politics. But Wednesday will be one of his toughest challenges yet.

"This video can not be played DUP leader attacks EU over Brexit talks Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar ""should know better"" than to ""play around"" with Northern Ireland over Brexit, the leader of the Democratic Unionist Party says. Arlene Foster accused Mr Varadkar of being ""reckless"" as Brexit talks enter a ""critical phase"". She was speaking after meeting Theresa May at Downing Street. The Irish government says any hard border with Northern Ireland should be off the table. And an EU paper recently suggested Northern Ireland would have to continue to follow many EU rules after Brexit if a hard border was to be avoided. It hinted Northern Ireland may need to stay in the EU customs union if there were to be no checks at the border. Barnier challenges UK on border plans Sinn FÃ©in 'glorifying murder', says DUP Stormont deadlock: What you need to know That is something which the UK Conservative government - which is supported in key votes by the DUP at Westminster - have said they cannot accept as it would effectively create a border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. The Irish government has said it will veto the start of Brexit trade talks unless border issues are concerned By the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg While there are genuine and sincerely held logistical and understandable concerns about what happens to the Irish border after Brexit, there is a sense building that perhaps the Irish government is playing those concerns rather harder than is justified. DUP leader Arlene Foster, using rather strong language, told off the Irish leader Leo Varadkar for doing just that today. But the next step in what many would say is a conspiracy theory, borne out of Brexiteer desperation, is to ponder whether the EU as a whole is over-egging their true level of worry about what happens to the border. Brexit and the Irish border: Is all as it seems? Speaking to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg, Mrs Foster said: ""Some people are taking their moment in the sun, to try and get the maximum in relation to the negotiations - and I understand that but you shouldn't play about with Northern Ireland particularly at a time when we're trying to bring about devolved government again."" She said that suggesting leaving the EU would jeopardise the peace process was ""a very careless thing to say"", particularly with no devolved administration in place, and accused Ireland's government of being ""reckless"". Mrs Foster said she recognised Brexit was a ""big shock"" for the Republic of Ireland - ""and they are trying to process all of that"". ""But they certainly shouldn't be using Northern Ireland to get the maximum deal for their citizens."" All you need to know about Brexit UK government wants an 'unprecedented solution' for the Irish border Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that will share a land border with an EU state post-Brexit, and what happens to the border is one of the key subjects being debated between the EU and the UK. Key to this is how to avoid customs checks on the border when the UK leaves the EU's customs union - the arrangement that allows goods to flow freely between member states. Negotiations have yet to make a breakthrough so the EU says talks on future matters like trade and customs cannot begin yet. But Mrs Foster said it was crucial to move on to the second phase now because the trade arrangement is linked to the border situation. The DUP pledged in June to support Theresa May's minority government over Brexit and other core issues as part of a parliamentary pact due to last at least two years. But Nigel Dodds, the party's deputy leader, has warned that any prospect of the border moving to the Irish Sea after Brexit - an idea suggested by some within the Irish government - would be ""gravely destabilising"" to the UK government.

But Ireland's foreign minister Simon Coveney said his government was right to seek more assurances about the border issue before agreeing to the next phase of Brexit talks.

Arguing Dublin had the support of the other 26 EU members, he added.

"Pairs of John Lennon's signature round glasses were also found German police have recovered more than 100 items stolen from John Lennon's estate, including three diaries. The diaries were put on display at Berlin police headquarters with other items including a tape recording of a Beatles concert, two pairs of glasses, sheet music and a cigarette case. Police said a 58-year-old man had been arrested on suspicion of handling stolen goods. The items were stolen in New York in 2006 from Lennon's widow, Yoko Ono. Detectives said much of the haul was confiscated from an auction house in Berlin in July, sparking an investigation to find the rest of the stolen items. Ono identified the objects from photos she was shown at the German consulate in New York, German media reported. The diaries, along with other items, were displayed by police in Berlin The suspect was arrested on Monday in Berlin after police searched his home and cars. Martin Steltner, a spokesman for the Berlin prosecutor's office, said another suspect, who lives in Turkey, ""is unattainable for us at the present time"". It is understood the second suspect used to work as a chauffeur for Ono. Mr Steltner said it was not clear when the recovered items could be returned to Lennon's estate.

"Chris Froome rode a Pinarello bicycle during the 2013 Tour de France A leading bicycle manufacturer is facing accusations of sexism and ageism in its adverts on social media. Pinarello,  who supply bicycles to Team Sky, recently launched its electronic road bike to much fanfare. The company said the e-bike was aimed at weekend riders and female riders who want to ""follow easily the men's pace"". The Italian-based company posted a series of posts on its Instagram channel, promoting the new model. The first advert featured a woman claiming she wanted to go cycling with her boyfriend but to keep up with him on the roads ""seemed impossible."" In its second advert, a 55-year-old man said he doesn't have the ""time to work out"" but wouldn't miss a ""Sunday ride with my friends."" Both adverts sparked criticism and complaints by cyclists on social media, including the hashtag#pinarellNO,external, a play on the company's name. The company has withdrawn the adverts but criticism continues. Christine Majerus, Luxembourg's road race national champion, said she's happy to compete against male professional cyclists who ride Pinarello bikes. Allow Twitter content?

"Most of the 10,000 cases that could be affected involved traffic offences Around 50 drug-driving prosecutions have been dropped because original test results may have been ""manipulated"". More than 10,000 cases, including violent crime, may have been affected, police chiefs said. They probed Randox Testing Services in Manchester after two men were arrested on suspicion of perverting the course of justice in February. BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said it was ""the biggest forensic science scandal in the UK for decades"". Lawyers for two people convicted over road deaths are now seeking to take their cases to the Court of Appeal. Concerns have also been raised about thousands of drug test results relied on by the civil courts to determine child custody issues and employment cases. Whilst 1,500 retests will be carried out by the end of the year, thousands more will have to take place in 2018 to check the results. However, not all samples will be able to be re-tested as some are no longer viable because of their quality or quantity. James Vaughan, from the NPCC, said this was the situation for many of the 50 cases dropped that were due to go to trial. Not every court was sympathetic to requests for proceedings to be adjourned, which in turn led to more cases being dropped, he added. By BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw Most of the 10,000 cases that could be affected involved traffic offences The scale of the re-testing that will now have to take place, together with a dearth of suitably-qualified experts, is such that police reckon it will be three years before all the re-testing is completed. I think that's a conservative estimate - it does not include the re-testing that may have to be done in non-criminal cases. The impact on an overstretched criminal justice system, where there are already delays in examining forensic evidence, can't be under-estimated; neither can the effect this will all have on public confidence. It will also doubtless raise questions about the decision to close down the government-owned Forensic Science Service in 2012, though private companies already played a big part in scientific testing before then. A total of 42 police forces across the country sent data to the laboratory for testing. Of the 10,000 cases that could have been affected, 75% were traffic offences, such as drug driving, the National Police Chiefs' Council said. Other cases included violent crime, sexual offences and unexplained deaths. So far, re-tests on samples involved in sexual offence cases, violence or homicide have showed no change. Potential data manipulation at a different facility, Trimega Laboratories, is also being investigated by Greater Manchester Police, said the NPCC. In these incidents, child protection and family court cases could be affected. Nick Hurd, the minister for policing, fire and criminal justice, said all tests carried out by Trimega between 2010 and 2014were currently being treated as ""potentially unreliable"",external. He also said due to ""poor record-keeping practices"", it may not be possible to identify all the customers affected. The Forensic Services Regulator said it had asked all major centres to carry out an audit of their cases to look at whether the issue was more widespread, but no evidence was uncovered. Gillian Tully, from the regulator, said: ""If there was large-scale manipulation going on across the board, I do expect it would have been found during that audit."" Nick Freeman, a solicitor who has defended clients who were inaccurately tested for drugs by Randox, said: ""It's absolutely imperative that the public have total confidence in a thoroughly reliable forensic science service, because we need to be sure that the results that are produced are 100% accurate. ""If they're not, innocent people are going to lose their children, be incarcerated, have their lives destroyed, on the basis of an entirely false premise."" Mr Hurd added: ""The government recognises the seriousness of this issue and the potential impact on public confidence in the use of forensic science within the justice system. ""The senior judiciary are aware and government officials are working with the police to monitor the scale of the issue, as information emerges.""

It saiditems in its Malm range and other chests and dressers,externalpose a ""serious tip-over and entrapment hazard"" if not secured to a wall, Ikea first recalled the furniture in 2016 after four children had died. It has no plans for a UK recall, stating that the chest of drawers ""meet all mandatory stability requirements"". Josef Dudek, a 2-year-old boy in California, died when he became trapped beneath a three-drawer Malm chest after he had been put down for a nap by his father. Since 2011, four other young children have been killed in connection with the Malm range. A further three children have died as a result of other Ikea chests and dressers tipping over, with the earliest death occurring in 1989. Jozef Dudek died after an Ikea Malm dresser toppled over onto him Widespread criticism spurred the companyto add China to the recall last year. However, it has not made announcements in other countries, including the UK. Ikea said it meets ""mandatory stability standards"" in all markets and that the products remain safe if secured to a wall, as recommended. It has a ""Secure It!"" campaignto raise awareness of the issue,external. A spokeswoman for Ikea said it was not aware of any tip-over fatalities outside the US and has no plans to expand the recall. She said: ""Our priority is and has always been to ensure that our products are safe to use. That means securing the chest of drawers to the wall according to the assembly instructions, using the tip-over restraint provided with the product. ""We don't believe a global recall from IKEA would be the solution. Instead, we are convinced that we can make a difference by raising awareness among consumers of the tip-over risks and how to prevent them through the global Secure it! campaign."" The re-launched recall involves Ikea children's chests of drawers taller than 60 cm and adult chest of drawers taller than 75 cm, including those from the Malm line. It follows reports of more than 300 tip-over incidents in the US and Canada since 1985, resulting in eight deaths and 144 injuries to children between the ages of 19 months and 10 years old. Lawyer Alan Feldman, an attorney for the Dudek family whose son was killed in May,has said that the recall in 2016 was not effective,external. Ikea said it had done ""extensive"" outreach to customers about the recall, including an email campaign. A spokeswoman said: ""The most recent incident has indicated to us that there is more work to be done in spreading the message. However, we had to wait to confirm that the product is IKEA, which took some time."" She said Ikea said it has provided refunds or wall-anchoring help for more than one million dressers or chests since 2015, when it started offering free anchoring kits.

BBC World Affairs Editor John Simpson writes: Most people assumed that
the only way Robert Mugabe would give up being president was to die in his
bed. He probably thought so too. In fact the last of the old-style
1970s and 80s liberation leaders most untypically resigned in writing. Perhaps that says something about the way the world has changed in the 21st century. No storming the presidential palace, no ugly
end at the hands of a crowd like Colonel Gaddafi, no execution by firing squad
like President Ceausescu of Romania, no hanging like Saddam Hussein. Zimbabwe, in spite of everything Robert Mugabe visited upon it, is essentially a peaceable, gentle country.  And despite all the immense crimes for which he was responsible, he is in some ways an intellectual, rather than a brutal thug. Heâll be remembered for the massacres in Matabeleland in the 1980s, for the farm invasions of the 1990s and later, and for the brutal repression of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change when they seemed on course to win the 2008 presidential election. The man who seems about to take his place, former vice-president Emmerson Mnangagwe, was deeply involved in most of those crimes, yet people in Zimbabwe - like the outside world - will be so relieved to see Mugabe go that they will be tempted to forget all that. Theyâll also forget the few unquestionably good things Robert Mugabe did. Zimbabwe, for instance, has an extraordinarily high literacy rate, because of him. But thatâs certainly not what heâll be remembered for.   During his first years in office, Mugabe was feted by leaders across the world, including Cuba's Fidel Castro. See more pictures from his life in office, here. From an icon of his nation's liberation to a cartoonish dictator - what was Robert Mugabe's rule like? For those who haven't followed the former president, the BBC's Joseph Winter has condensed decades of Mugabe's political career: Even after 37 years in power, Mr Mugabe still maintained the same worldview - the patriotic socialist forces of his Zanu-PF party were still fighting the twin evils of capitalism and colonialism.

Following their report that former vice president Emmerson Mnangagwa will be sworn in as vice president in the coming days, Reuters now says he will serve until 2018. The chief whip of ruling party Zanu-PF, Lovemore Matuke, told the news agency that Mr Mnangagwa would serve the remainder of Mugabe's term. Under the current schedule, the next
general elections could be held as late as September 2018. The Visionguinee news website reports... BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Guinean president and current African Union chief, Alpha 
Conde, has said he is ""truly delighted"" that former 
President Robert Mugabe has agreed to resign. Mr Conde also described Mugabe as a ""great fighter"" and 
an ""African hero"". ""It is a shame that he is leaving through the back door and 
that he is forsaken by the parliament,"" he added. Mr Conde said that the presidential election 
should be held in 2018 and that the African Union will offer 
all its support to Zimbabwe for its organisation. Reuters news agency reports that Mr Emmerson Mnangagwa - the former and briefly exiled vice-president - will be sworn in as president on either Wednesday or Thursday. It quoted the ruling Zanu-PF party's legal secretary. Speaking to BBC television earlier, activist and political candidate Vimbaishe Musvaburi cried as she described what Mr Mugabe's departure meant.

Zimbabwe's sacked Vice-President Emmerson Mnangagwa will take over as president in the next 48 hours, ruling party chief whip Lovemore Matuke has told The Associated Press news agency. Mr Mnangagwa engineered the downfall of Mr Mugabe after he sacked him about two weeks ago. The veteran leader apparently wanted to anoint his wife, Grace Mugabe, as his political heir, but the move backfired as the army and ruling party rallied behind Mr Mnangagwa.

"Paul Coppola was jailed for two years for faking the will of his relative Desiderio Coppola A man who faked a relative's will to prevent a charity benefitting from a multi-million pound legacy has been jailed. Paul Coppola, 65,admitted forging the signature of Desiderio Coppolajust days before his death in October 2011. The deceased had wanted his Â£7m estate to be divided between his family and the balance left to the charity, Medecins Sans Frontieres. Coppola was jailed for two years at Edinburgh Sheriff Court. The court was told that Coppola had known his second cousin, Desiderio Coppola, all his life and that the accused had referred to him as ""uncle"". In July 2010 Desiderio Coppola made a will bequeathing much of his estate to his friends and family, including Â£100,000 to Paul Coppola. It also gave instructions that tenants of business premises that he owned were to be offered the chance to buy them. Mr Coppola also stated that the residue of his estate was to go to Medecins Sans Frontieres, the charity that provides medical assistance in war torn regions and developing countries. However, days before his gravely ill relative's death, the court was told that Paul Coppola presented a new will to the family that made no mention of the charity. It also made no reference to the business premises and instructed that the remainder of the estate be paid to Coppola, of Waverley Park Terrace, Edinburgh. Coppola was jailed for two years at Edinburgh Sheriff Court Fiscal Ann MacNeill told the court that the day after Desiderio Coppola's death, the accused contacted his goddaughter, Elvira Fearn, to tell her about the content of the faked document. The fiscal said: ""Although she had no knowledge of the wills or the deceased's intentions, she was suspicious of the will because she was aware that the deceased hated to pay tax and she did not believe that he would have omitted Medecins Sans Frontieres completely and left the residue to the accused as there would have been a large tax liability to pay."" She added: ""Elvira Fearn was of the opinion that the changes to the will reflected the accused's allegiances rather than the wishes of the deceased."" Several days after the death, friends and family held a meeting with Coppola, where he was asked how the new will had come about. The fiscal said: ""The accused explained that he found out that the deceased was due to leave the majority of his wealth to charity and that he had persuaded the deceased to change his will. ""He said the deceased had agreed to change the terms of his will."" In June 2012 confirmation of the will was granted and a total of Â£1.2m was paid to friends and family who had been bequeathed specific amounts. By March 2013 Coppola had received a property from the estate in Edinburgh's Raeburn Place, which he sold for Â£290,000. He also received a further property in the city's Waterloo Place. Coppola also received more than Â£270,000 from the estate into his bank account in October 2013. However, weeks later lawyers went to the Court of Session in Edinburgh and successfully raised an action to have the will set aside. Coppola chose not to defend the action. The police were informed and lawyers then took over administration of the estate and began trying to recover money that had been due to the charity. Coppola later admitted to officers that he had forged the signature of his relative. Sheriff Frank Crowe told him: ""Your actions caused much grief, inconvenience and disappointment to the other legatees and your friends and uncertainty to the tenants of properties which were rented from the deceased."" The sheriff told Coppola he would have faced a three-year jail sentence if he had been convicted after trial, but it would be reduced in view of his early guilty plea.

"Rodney Bewes, who has died aged 79, found fame as the aspirational Bob in theBBC sitcom The Likely Lads. Teaming Bewes with James Bolam, it regularly drew audiences of more than 20 million. Despite the success of a sequel, the two fell out in spectacular style - effectively ending the chance of the series being continued. It turned out to be the peak of Bewes's career and he later found himself reduced to playing a series of less distinguished roles. Rodney Bewes was born in Bingley, Yorkshire, on 27 November 1937. His family later moved to Luton in Bedfordshire where his schooling was often interrupted by ill-health. He answered a newspaper letter from a BBC producer asking for children to appear in the corporation's Children's Hour. He appeared alongside his friend Tom Courtenay in Billy Liar By the age of 14 he had appeared in a number of BBC TV productions including a role as Joe in a 1952 adaptation of The Pickwick Papers. He also secured a place at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art's preparatory school. ""All the kids were posh and they were the children of actors in the West End of London and I'm just this boy from Bingley, near Bradford, and broad Yorkshire,"" he later recalled. After completing his National Service in the RAF he returned to Rada. He financed his studies by washing up in hotels at night, something that caused him to fall asleep during the day which culminated in him being asked to leave the academy. He managed to secure some small stage roles, as well as parts in TV productions including Dixon of Dock Green, Emergency Ward 10 and Z-Cars. He made his film debut in 1962 in Prize of Arms, a yarn about a gang that attempts to rob an army payroll convoy. The film is notable for early performances by a number of later well-known actors including Tom Bell, Jack May and Fulton Mackay. A year later he secured the role of Arthur Crabtree in Billy Liar, alongside his friend Tom Courtenay. It was the age of British cinema's so-called new wave, when film-makers were turning their attention to gritty working-class dramas and desperate for actors with regional accents. There was a brief spell as straight man for Basil Brush Despite Bewes hailing from Yorkshire, rather than Tyneside, he was cast as Bob Ferris in The Likely Lads, a sitcom conceived by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais. His aspirational character was in direct contrast to that of his friend, Terry Collier, the workshy, cynical figure played by James Bolam. Much of the comedy revolved around Bob's attempts to become middle-class in the face of constant derision from Terry. The final series ended in 1966 and Bewes played a number of TV parts and was also in films including Man in a Suitcase, Spring and Port Wine and a star-studded musical version of Alice in Wonderland in which he played the Knave of Hearts. He spent a year as Mr Rodney, who was one of a series of stooges for the puppet Basil Brush, before creating and starring in the ITV sitcom Dear Mother... Love Albert. It showcased his skills as a scriptwriter and proved to be popular with audiences. In 1973 he teamed up with James Bolam again forWhatever Happened to the Likely Lads,a sequel to the original series. The series saw Bolam's character Terry return from his time away in the Army to discover that Bewes's Bob has bought his own house, secured a managerial job and is engaged to the boss's daughter. Off stage the pair enjoyed a warm relationship. ""We were great friends,"" said Bewes. ""When my babies were born, his was the first house I went to."" In 1975 there was a film spin-off which proved to be the last time the pair worked together. Bolam was famous for guarding his privacy and was furious when Bewes let slip to a newspaper that Bolam's wife, the actress Susan Jameson, was pregnant. Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads was even more successful than the original series After a fraught phone call the two did not speak to each other again. Bolam was so incensed that he refused to appear on an edition of This Is Your Life, which featured his former acting partner. ""It's this actor's ego thing - he thinks he is important,""Bewes once said.,external ""Actors aren't important. I'm not important; I have fun. I think Jimmy takes himself very seriously as an actor."" Bewes's acting career never again scaled the heights of Likely Lads. There were bit parts in the films Jabberwocky and The Wildcats of St Trinians and he was able to use his abilities as a serious actor in a 1980 TV adaptation of the Restoration play 'Tis Pity She's a Whore. Earlier in his career he had appeared in productions of She Stoops to Conquer and there was a role in a 1984 production of George Gascoigne's play Big in Brazil at the Old Vic Theatre in London, with Prunella Scales and Timothy West. In the same year he also appeared in a Doctor Who story entitled Resurrection of the Daleks. It was one of his last significant appearances on the small screen. He had some stage success with his one-man shows, Three Men in a Boat and Diary of a Nobody, which he toured for more than a decade. He won a Stella Artois Prize for the former at the 1997 Edinburgh Festival. His role in Resurrection of the Daleks was one of his last TV appearances His wife, the designer Daphne Black, whom he married in 1973, acted as his helper, setting up the stage and the props for his various performances. Bewes never gave up on the idea of a revival of The Likely Lads, feeling that the characters were still relevant 40 years on. ""Instead of being the Likely Lads, we'd have been the Unlikeliest Granddads,"" he said. ""We would have been sitting on a park bench in a pair of grubby grey anoraks, feeding the pigeons and grumping about youngsters.""

"Robert Gabriel Mugabe was educated at a mission school and went on to train as teacher, graduating from Fort Hare university where Nelson Mandela studied. In 1958, he went to work in Ghana There he met Sally Hafron whom he married in 1961. She was actually more political than him before he was recruited by black nationalists. He was later imprisoned by the Rhodesian government, but was not allowed to attend the funeral of his son After his release from jail in 1974, he came to prominence as one of the leaders of a guerrilla war against white-minority rule, along with Joshua Nkomo (left) They agreed to disarm at peace talks hosted by the British. They formed the patriotic front - and to the surprise of Western observers won elections held in February 1980 by a landslide Robert Mugabe had arrived in the country only six weeks before the election, after spending 10 years in exile. He became prime minister, forming an inclusive government During his first years in office, he was feted by leaders across the world, including Cuba's Fidel Castro, who visited the country in 1986 He also had a close relationship with UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher - and initially pursued a policy of reconciliation with his white former enemies, letting them keep their economic wealth He married his typist Grace Marufu, with whom he already had two children, in 1996 a few years after his first wife died. The 1990s also saw the country's intervention in the war in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which proved costly to the economy When Tony Blair's UK government pulled out of talks to fund controversial land reforms in 1997 and after Mr Mugabe lost a referendum on a new constitution three years later, pro-Mugabe militias began to invade white-owned farms It was around this time that Mr Mugabe abandoned his Savile Row and safari suits in favour of brightly coloured attire emblazoned with his face when he was on the campaign trail It became a cult of personality, and big celebrations were organised by the ruling Zanu-PF party each year to mark his birthday... These included extravagant cakes. This one reflects how many Africans regarded him as a hero, admiring his stand against white farmers However, his popularity, especially in urban areas, steadily declined at home - and he lost the first round of the presidential election in 2008, winning the run-off after the opposition MDC withdrew, citing violence Sanctions imposed by the US and EU prompted Mr Mugabe's ""Look East"" policy, turning to China for investment. He used to travel to Asia for medical treatment - his daughter Bona (C) studied in Hong Kong and Singapore His Zanu-PF party won elections in 2013, after four years of a power-sharing government, on a platform of indigenisation - a policy of ceding economic control to black Zimbabweans. Crippling cash shortages led to protests in 2016 However, the security forces always stood by Mr Mugabe - until his wife's ambition for power proved too much for them to stomach and they launched a takeover on 15 November 2017 They were anxious that it not look like a coup, and Mr Mugabe carried on with some of his duties - though his age showed as he appeared to doze during a graduation ceremony But after a mass demonstration and amid impeachment proceedings, the 93-year-old leader bowed to pressure. He resigned after 37 years in power - prompting wild celebrations. All pictures copyright Â© 2025 BBC.

"The resignation of Robert Mugabe comes after Zimbabwe's military took over the country and put him under house arrest Theresa May has welcomed the resignation of Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe, saying it offered an opportunity to ""rebuild the country's economy"". The president stepped down after 37 years in power via a letter that was read out to the country's parliament. It followed a takeover by the Zimbabwean military, who put Mr Mugabe under house arrest last week. Boris Johnson called the end of Mr Mugabe's reign a ""moment of hope."" Zimbabwe's President Mugabe resigns Live updates from Harare Robert Mugabe - hero or villain? How Zimbabwe is celebrating The 93-year-old had resisted calls to step down, despite the intervention of the country's military and protests across the capital of Harare. However, on Tuesday, parliament speaker Jacob Mudenda read a letter from the former leader of Zanu-PF, which said his decision was ""voluntary"" and ""arising from my concern for the welfare of the people of Zimbabwe."" Responding to the announcement, Mrs May said: ""In recent days we have seen the desire of the Zimbabwean people for free and fair elections and the opportunity to rebuild the country's economy under a legitimate government. ""As Zimbabwe's oldest friend, we will do all we can to support this, working with our international and regional partners to help the country achieve the brighter future it so deserves."" The foreign secretary also welcomed the announcement, but warned it should not mark ""the transition from one despotic rule to another"". Mr Johnson said: ""I think it's very important at the moment that we don't focus too much on the personalities. ""Let's concentrate on the potential, the hope for Zimbabwe - an incredible country, a beautiful country, blessed with extraordinary physical and human potential."" This video can not be played Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson says Robert Mugabe's resignation as president is a ""moment of hope"" for Zimbabwe Asked about what he thought should happen to Mr Mugabe and his wife Grace - who the former leader had been priming as a successor - he added: ""[Mr Mugabe] played an important part in the birth of the independent nation of Zimbabwe. ""And yet, tragically, he allowed that legacy to be squandered and his country went to rack and ruin and in some cases his people were driven to the brink of starvation. ""It's time now for a new future and how Robert Mugabe spends the rest of his years is very much a matter for his countrymen."" Labour MP and former Africa minister, Peter Hain, said the president's attempt to ensure Grace Mugabe would follow in his footsteps was his downfall. He told BBC News: ""It was his determination to create a family dynasty and protect himself that finally meant his party gave up on him and the ruling elite gave up on him as well. ""The Zanu-PF party, that Mugabe had controlled with an iron fist, reacted against it and would not accept his wife being ushered in as his presidential replacement. ""The military said we have had enough and we are not going to put up with this, although they had ruled with him and supported him at times in murderous extermination of the opposition. Lord Peter Hain met with Mr Mugabe when he was the minister for Africa in 1999 Lord Hain added that the people of Zimbabwe had the chance for a ""fresh start"", and called on former vice president Emmerson Mnangagwa, who is expected to will be sworn in as president in the coming days, to take the country ""in a different direction"". Salil Shetty, secretary general of London-based Amnesty International, said Mr Mugabe's leadership had allowed ""grotesque crimes to thrive"", but his resignation was a turning point. She said: ""After more than three decades of violent repression, the way forward for the country is to renounce the abuses of the past and transition into a new era where the rule of law is respected and those who are responsible for injustices are held to account.""

"RT has run a series of ad campaigns on the London Underground Google is to ""derank"" stories from Kremlin-owned publications Russia Today (RT) and Sputnik in response to allegations about election meddling by President Putin's government. Alphabet chairman Eric Schmidt said the search giant needed to deal with the spread of misinformation. RT has been described by US intelligence agencies as ""Russia's state-run propaganda machine"". The publications said the move was a form of censorship. Speaking at the Halifax International Security Forum, Mr Schmidt said: ""We're well aware of this one, and we're working on detecting this kind of scenario you're describing and deranking those kinds of sites."" He then named two of Russia's biggest media outlets: RT, a TV and online news organisation, and Sputnik, an online media network. ""I am strongly not in favour of censorship. I am very strongly in favour of ranking. It's what we do,"" he added. ""It's a very legitimate question as to how we rank, A or B, right? And we do the best we can in millions and millions of rankings every day,"" said Mr Schmidt. But he added that it was a constant tug-of-war altering the search giant's algorithms to detect ""weaponised"" information because those seeking to manipulate the news agenda ""will get better tools too"". The comments drew an angry response from the two publications, which have always defended themselves as legitimate news organisations. ""Good to have Google on record as defying all logic and reason: facts aren't allowed if they come from RT, 'because Russia' - even if we have Google on Congressional record saying they've found no manipulation of their platform or policy violations by RT,""Sputnik and RT editor-in-chief Margarita Simonyan said in a statement published on RT.,external In October, Twitter announced that it would no longer allow advertisements from RT and Sputnik. And in November, RT was forced to register itself as a '""foreign agent"" by the US Department of Justice. The broadcaster is fighting the order in court. Russia has repeatedly denied claims that it interfered in the 2016 presidential elections.

"Most of the 10,000 cases that could be affected involved traffic offences Around 50 drug-driving prosecutions have been dropped because original test results may have been ""manipulated"". More than 10,000 cases, including violent crime, may have been affected, police chiefs said. They probed Randox Testing Services in Manchester after two men were arrested on suspicion of perverting the course of justice in February. BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said it was ""the biggest forensic science scandal in the UK for decades"". Lawyers for two people convicted over road deaths are now seeking to take their cases to the Court of Appeal. Concerns have also been raised about thousands of drug test results relied on by the civil courts to determine child custody issues and employment cases. Whilst 1,500 retests will be carried out by the end of the year, thousands more will have to take place in 2018 to check the results. However, not all samples will be able to be re-tested as some are no longer viable because of their quality or quantity. James Vaughan, from the NPCC, said this was the situation for many of the 50 cases dropped that were due to go to trial. Not every court was sympathetic to requests for proceedings to be adjourned, which in turn led to more cases being dropped, he added. By BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw Most of the 10,000 cases that could be affected involved traffic offences The scale of the re-testing that will now have to take place, together with a dearth of suitably-qualified experts, is such that police reckon it will be three years before all the re-testing is completed. I think that's a conservative estimate - it does not include the re-testing that may have to be done in non-criminal cases. The impact on an overstretched criminal justice system, where there are already delays in examining forensic evidence, can't be under-estimated; neither can the effect this will all have on public confidence. It will also doubtless raise questions about the decision to close down the government-owned Forensic Science Service in 2012, though private companies already played a big part in scientific testing before then. A total of 42 police forces across the country sent data to the laboratory for testing. Of the 10,000 cases that could have been affected, 75% were traffic offences, such as drug driving, the National Police Chiefs' Council said. Other cases included violent crime, sexual offences and unexplained deaths. So far, re-tests on samples involved in sexual offence cases, violence or homicide have showed no change. Potential data manipulation at a different facility, Trimega Laboratories, is also being investigated by Greater Manchester Police, said the NPCC. In these incidents, child protection and family court cases could be affected. Nick Hurd, the minister for policing, fire and criminal justice, said all tests carried out by Trimega between 2010 and 2014were currently being treated as ""potentially unreliable"",external. He also said due to ""poor record-keeping practices"", it may not be possible to identify all the customers affected. The Forensic Services Regulator said it had asked all major centres to carry out an audit of their cases to look at whether the issue was more widespread, but no evidence was uncovered. Gillian Tully, from the regulator, said: ""If there was large-scale manipulation going on across the board, I do expect it would have been found during that audit."" Nick Freeman, a solicitor who has defended clients who were inaccurately tested for drugs by Randox, said: ""It's absolutely imperative that the public have total confidence in a thoroughly reliable forensic science service, because we need to be sure that the results that are produced are 100% accurate. ""If they're not, innocent people are going to lose their children, be incarcerated, have their lives destroyed, on the basis of an entirely false premise."" Mr Hurd added: ""The government recognises the seriousness of this issue and the potential impact on public confidence in the use of forensic science within the justice system. ""The senior judiciary are aware and government officials are working with the police to monitor the scale of the issue, as information emerges.""

"Find out how much you've spent on the so-called tampon tax - the VAT on sanitary products. Tampons and towels are currently taxed at 5% in the UK. But they have been subject to five different rates since 1973. So how much you've spent depends on how old you are and when you started your first period. Try our calculator to see roughly what you've spent so far, and how much you might spend in your lifetime. Your browser does not support this calculator Age your period started should not be greater than your current age. All figures are in current prices. The lifetime VAT calculation assumes a continued rate of 5%. Can't see the calculator? Clickhere,external. The calculator is based on a number of assumptions: You have 13 periods a year with a 28-day cycle - although periods can range from 21 to 35 days You use 22 tampons and/or towels per cycle You will go through, or went through, menopause at age 51 Tampons and towels cost 13p per unit Biological figures are based on information fromNHS UK.,externalThe unit cost is an average calculated on today's prices, courtesy of mysupermarket.co.uk, from three leading UK retailers (not including those which have already reduced their prices by 5% to cover the tampon tax). We reached your result by calculating how many years you were menstruating for during each of the five VAT rates that have applied to sanitary products since 1973 and how many years you are likely to continue to menstruate, assuming that menopause is at age 51. All calculations are in whole years, from 1 January of the year you entered. For simplicity, we have not taken pregnancy or other reasons for missing periods into the calculation. The figure of 22 products used per cycle is from theAbsorbent Hygiene Products Manufacturers Association,externaland theWomen's Environmental Network,external. This video can not be played Counting the cost of the tampon tax Value Added Tax is currently charged at the reduced rate of5% on sanitary products,external, including panty liners and certain maternity pads. But this hasn't always been the case. The UK first introduced VAT in 1973 when it joined the European Economic Community, with a standard rate of 10% - which applied to sanitary products. In summer 1974, standard VAT was cut to 8%, before rising to 15% in 1979 and 17.5% in 1991. The Labour government moved sanitary products on to a reduced rate of 5% from January 2001, following a campaign and debates in parliament. This is currently the lowest rate possible under the EU's VAT rules. In 2015, activist Laura Coryton created apetition,externalcalling for the UK government to introduce a zero-rate for the products, which gained more than 320,000 signatures. That October, the government confirmed it would seek a change in EU law to allow any rate of VAT to be applied to sanitary protection, as part of a review of VAT rates to be undertaken by the European Commission in 2016. And the then Chancellor George Osborne announced in the 2015 Autumn Statement that the funds raised by VAT on tampons and towels would be donated to women's health and support charities. This sum was worth Â£15m in 2016-17. In July this year, supermarket Tesco cut prices on nearly 100 menstrual protection products in order to shoulder the 5% VAT cost. Competitors Waitrose and Morrisons followed suit in August and other retailers have pledged to pass on a price cut if VAT becomes zero-rated. The European Commission says it is aiming to bring in a zero rate for sanitary products in 2018 and the UK government has already legislated to allow this to happen as soon as rules change. But for now, tampons and towels will be continue to be charged for VAT at the same rate as solar panels, child car seats and nicotine patches.

"Pairs of John Lennon's signature round glasses were also found German police have recovered more than 100 items stolen from John Lennon's estate, including three diaries. The diaries were put on display at Berlin police headquarters with other items including a tape recording of a Beatles concert, two pairs of glasses, sheet music and a cigarette case. Police said a 58-year-old man had been arrested on suspicion of handling stolen goods. The items were stolen in New York in 2006 from Lennon's widow, Yoko Ono. Detectives said much of the haul was confiscated from an auction house in Berlin in July, sparking an investigation to find the rest of the stolen items. Ono identified the objects from photos she was shown at the German consulate in New York, German media reported. The diaries, along with other items, were displayed by police in Berlin The suspect was arrested on Monday in Berlin after police searched his home and cars. Martin Steltner, a spokesman for the Berlin prosecutor's office, said another suspect, who lives in Turkey, ""is unattainable for us at the present time"". It is understood the second suspect used to work as a chauffeur for Ono. Mr Steltner said it was not clear when the recovered items could be returned to Lennon's estate.

"This video can not be played The crashes happened in the Scottish Borders and near Inverness (some people may find images in this report distressing) Three deaths at a rally in the Scottish Borders could have been avoided if people had been clearly banned from standing in the area where the crash took place, a sheriff has ruled. A fatal accident inquiry was held into the deaths at the Jim Clark Rally in 2014, and a fourth fatality at the Snowman Rally near Inverness in 2013. Sheriff Kenneth Maciver found no reasonable precautions could have avoided the death at the Snowman Rally. A joint inquiry examined both events. Iain Provan, 64, Elizabeth Allan, 63, and Len Stern, 71, died at the Jim Clark Rally. Joy Robson, 51, lost her life at the Snowman Rally the previous year. Elizabeth Allan, Len Stern and Iain Provan died at the Jim Clark Rally in 2014, while Joy Robson, right, died at the Snowman Rally in 2013 The inquiry found,externalthat all four had died from ""multiple injuries"" after being struck by the cars, which had experienced an ""involuntary loss of control"". The sheriff said he found no defects in the system of working at the Snowman Rally, and that no precautions might have avoided the death. However, he said that the deaths at the Jim Clark event might have been avoided had an area north of the Leet bridge been ""created, delineated and identified"" so it ""clearly prohibited spectators or photographers from standing anywhere in that area"". He also identified a ""weak, ambiguous, and ultimately inadequate verification system"" for checking the proper performance of the work of stage commanders or stage setup crews in identifying the areas which were prohibited to spectators for safety reasons. The sheriff delivered a string of recommendations including: all rallies should have clear and properly prepared set-up arrangements shared with marshals so they are clear of precise prohibited areas at least one safety car should have a specific remit to ensure prohibited areas are clearly marked rally organisers should keep a record of crashes or ""near misses"" to identify areas where spectators might be at risk of injury the introduction of a warning light system in rally cars to ensure they can be stopped as quickly as possible consideration should be given to training marshals to deal with situations where spectators put themselves on a live rally track. The sheriff criticised the verification system at the Jim Clark Rally A spokesman for the Jim Clark Rally said: ""Those involved in the organisation of the rally have received a copy of the sheriff's determination. ""This is quite a lengthy report which will have to be read and digested. ""After which the senior officials will meet up to discuss it and its findings."" Donald Martin suffered a shattered pelvis in the crash at the Jim Clark Rally Donald Martin, from Renfrew was among those injured in the Jim Clark Rally crash. He suffered a shattered pelvis, seven fractured ribs and injuries to his leg. He had been watching the rally with his sister-in-law Ms Allan, her partner Mr Provan and his friend Mr Stern. He told BBC Scotlandthey believed they were in a ""safe area"". ""Where we stood there was no signage to state that there were no spectators allowed to stand there and we were even allowed to stand behind the taped area and considered it a safe area,"" he said. ""We didn't get moved in any way. We assumed it was safe. The organisers didn't tell us anything different. They came through with the spectator control cars and nobody moved us back from the taped area."" Speaking ahead of the publication of the sheriff's findings, he said he hoped rallying overall would be made a ""lot safer"" from a spectator point of view. Andrew Henderson, from Thompsons Solicitors, issued a statement on behalf of Ms Robson's family. ""For Joy's children this was never about trying to stop rallying but rather to improve safety for the spectators,"" he said. ""They always believed that the best way to do this was through the FAI process so that evidence could be properly evaluated and recommendations made. ""This is a very difficult time for them but they are absolutely resolute in their wish that no other family should ever go through the horror they have and that rallying is made as safe for its fans as it can possibly be."" Rob Jones, chief executive of the Motor Sports Association, welcomed the swift publication of the determination and its ""thoroughness"". ""We acknowledge the sheriff's analysis of the circumstances leading up to each accident, in both cases arising in the context of events that were organised by what were stated to be experienced volunteers demonstrating the highest levels of dedication and responsibility,"" he said. ""At this stage, we require more time to fully consider the sheriff's recommendations and we will offer our response as soon as we are able to do so. In the meantime, we wish to reiterate our sincere sympathies to the victims' families."" Plans to hold a hearing into both accidentswere announced almost a year ago. The Crown Office said new legislation, making possible to hold a single hearing into deaths in different parts of Scotland, would allow it to hold such an inquiry for the first time. The aim was to examine the full circumstances of the accidents and ""help to avoid such incidents happening in the future"". The Crown Office said the two events raised ""similar questions in relation to spectator safety at rallies"", and that the Lord Advocate felt it was in the public interest for the issues to be explored together. Edinburgh Sheriff Court heard from a wide range of witnesses to both crashes. The inquiry began in mid-July with a rally driver describing howhis car went out of control before hitting a spectator at the Snowman event. Ms Robson's son, Dean, also gave evidence of the moments leading up to his mother's death. After a couple of weeks, attention turned to the events at the Jim Clark Rally where three people died. A co-driver at the rally recountedhow she had tried to give medical aid to people at the scene. The driver of the car involved in the crash broke downas he told the inquiry he saw a woman ""flying in the air"".

"Camelot, the operator of the National Lottery, is planning to introduce a new game which offers winners a monthly income for the rest of their lives. Instead of winning a lump sum, those taking part could win as much as Â£10,000 a month, providing them with a lifetime annuity. Camelot said it was one of the different options it was looking at as a way for it to attract new players. It follows a poor performance, as the firm raised less money for good causes. A spokesperson for Camelot said binge spending was not a factor behind the idea. He said it was for people who had ""a different dream"". It is likely to be introduced some time in 2019. In the six months to the 23 September, National Lottery ticket sales fell by 3.2% compared to the same period last year. Over the same time it raised Â£746.6m for good causes, a 4.7% drop on 2016. Camelot UK has also appointed Nigel Railton as its permanent chief executive. He is charged with returning the National Lottery to growth. Mr Railton is said to be keen on the annuity idea, having spent time in Chicago as boss of Camelot Global. In the United States pay-outs of $10,000 a month for life are a regular feature of local lotteries. In the UK a small number of lump-sum lottery winners have lost all their cash after spending it. Since 1994 it is thought that around ten millionaires have blown their winnings, out of 4,750 winners. Pete Kyle, who reportedly spent most of his Â£5m winnings Among them was Pete Kyle from Plymouth, who won over Â£5m in 2005. In August this year The Sunreported,externalthat he was penniless, after blowing the cash on luxury cars and holidays. Camelot said it was also planning to re-design its Lotto game, following criticism by players. In 2015 it added 10 extra balls to the draw, making it harder to win a jackpot. From next year it said it will offer a better game, with a jackpot being won more frequently. However it is going to keep the existing number of balls.

BBC World Affairs Editor John Simpson writes: Most people assumed that
the only way Robert Mugabe would give up being president was to die in his
bed. He probably thought so too. In fact the last of the old-style
1970s and 80s liberation leaders most untypically resigned in writing. Perhaps that says something about the way the world has changed in the 21st century. No storming the presidential palace, no ugly
end at the hands of a crowd like Colonel Gaddafi, no execution by firing squad
like President Ceausescu of Romania, no hanging like Saddam Hussein. Zimbabwe, in spite of everything Robert Mugabe visited upon it, is essentially a peaceable, gentle country.  And despite all the immense crimes for which he was responsible, he is in some ways an intellectual, rather than a brutal thug. Heâll be remembered for the massacres in Matabeleland in the 1980s, for the farm invasions of the 1990s and later, and for the brutal repression of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change when they seemed on course to win the 2008 presidential election. The man who seems about to take his place, former vice-president Emmerson Mnangagwe, was deeply involved in most of those crimes, yet people in Zimbabwe - like the outside world - will be so relieved to see Mugabe go that they will be tempted to forget all that. Theyâll also forget the few unquestionably good things Robert Mugabe did. Zimbabwe, for instance, has an extraordinarily high literacy rate, because of him. But thatâs certainly not what heâll be remembered for.   During his first years in office, Mugabe was feted by leaders across the world, including Cuba's Fidel Castro. See more pictures from his life in office, here. From an icon of his nation's liberation to a cartoonish dictator - what was Robert Mugabe's rule like? For those who haven't followed the former president, the BBC's Joseph Winter has condensed decades of Mugabe's political career: Even after 37 years in power, Mr Mugabe still maintained the same worldview - the patriotic socialist forces of his Zanu-PF party were still fighting the twin evils of capitalism and colonialism.

Following their report that former vice president Emmerson Mnangagwa will be sworn in as vice president in the coming days, Reuters now says he will serve until 2018. The chief whip of ruling party Zanu-PF, Lovemore Matuke, told the news agency that Mr Mnangagwa would serve the remainder of Mugabe's term. Under the current schedule, the next
general elections could be held as late as September 2018. The Visionguinee news website reports... BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Guinean president and current African Union chief, Alpha 
Conde, has said he is ""truly delighted"" that former 
President Robert Mugabe has agreed to resign. Mr Conde also described Mugabe as a ""great fighter"" and 
an ""African hero"". ""It is a shame that he is leaving through the back door and 
that he is forsaken by the parliament,"" he added. Mr Conde said that the presidential election 
should be held in 2018 and that the African Union will offer 
all its support to Zimbabwe for its organisation. Reuters news agency reports that Mr Emmerson Mnangagwa - the former and briefly exiled vice-president - will be sworn in as president on either Wednesday or Thursday. It quoted the ruling Zanu-PF party's legal secretary. Speaking to BBC television earlier, activist and political candidate Vimbaishe Musvaburi cried as she described what Mr Mugabe's departure meant.

Zimbabwe's sacked Vice-President Emmerson Mnangagwa will take over as president in the next 48 hours, ruling party chief whip Lovemore Matuke has told The Associated Press news agency.

"Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa, the man known as ""the crocodile"" because of his political cunning, achieved a long-held ambition to succeed Robert Mugabe as Zimbabwe's president in November last year. He has now won a disputed presidential election to legitimise his rule, promising voters his efforts to woo foreign investors will bring back the economy from the brink of collapse. Mr Mugabe resigned following a military takeover and mass demonstrations - all sparked by his sacking of Mr Mnangagwa as his vice-president. ""The crocodile"", who lived up to his name and snapped back, may have unseated Zimbabwe's only ruler, but he is also associated with some of the worst atrocities committed under the ruling Zanu-PF party since independence in 1980. One veteran of the liberation struggle, who worked with him for many years, once put it simply: ""He's a very cruel man, very cruel."" But his children see him as a principled, if unemotional, man. His daughter, Farai Mlotshwa - a property developer and the eldest of his nine children by two wives - told BBC Radio 4 that he was a ""softie"". As if to reinforce this softer image of the new leader, a cuddly crocodile soft toy was passed among the Zanu-PF supporters who welcomed him back to the country after Mr Mugabe's resignation. Emmerson Mnangagwa is known as ""Ngwena"", the Shona word for crocodile And what he lacks in charisma and oratory prowess, he makes up for in pragmatism, says close friend and Zanu-PF politician Josiah Hungwe. ""Mnangagwa is a practical person. He is a person who recognises that politics is politics but people must eat,"" he told the BBC, adding that reforming Zimbabwe's disastrous economy will be the focus of his leadership. This video can not be played Emmerson Mnangagwa: Who is the man known as the âcrocodileâ? Known as ""the crocodile"" because of his political shrewdness - his Zanu-PF faction is ""Lacoste"" Received military training in China and Egypt Tortured by Rhodesian forces after his ""crocodile gang"" staged attacks Helped direct Zimbabwe's war of independence in the 1960s and 1970s Became the country's spymaster during the 1980s civil conflict, in which thousands of civilians were killed, but has denied any role in the massacres Accused of masterminding attacks on opposition supporters after 2008 election Says he will deliver jobs, and seen as open to economic reforms Survived several alleged assassination attempts, blamed on Mugabe supporters Find out more on BBC Radio 4's Profile. The exact year of Mr Mnangagwa's birth is not known - but he is thought to be 75, which would make him nearly 20 years younger than his predecessor who left power aged 93. Born in the central region of Zvishavane, he is a Karanga - the largest clan of Zimbabwe's majority Shona community. Some Karangas felt it was their turn for power, following 37 years of domination by Mr Mugabe's Zezuru clan, though Mr Mnangagwa was accused of profiting while under Mr Mugabe. According to a United Nations report in 2001, he was seen as ""the architect of the commercial activities of Zanu-PF"". This largely related to the operations of the Zimbabwean army and businessmen in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Zimbabwean troops intervened in the DR Congo conflict on the side of the government and, like those of other countries, were accused of using the conflict to loot some of its rich natural resources such as diamonds, gold and other minerals. More recently military officials - many behind his rise to power -have been accused of benefiting from the rich Marange diamond fields in eastern Zimbabwe, with reports of killings and human rights abuses there. Despite his money-raising role, Mr Mnangagwa, a lawyer who grew up in Zambia, was not always well-loved by the rank and file of his own party. A Zanu-PF official posed an interesting question when asked about Mr Mnangagwa's prospects: ""You think Mugabe is bad, but have you thought that whoever comes after him could be even worse?"" The opposition candidate who defeated Mr Mnangagwa in the 2000 parliamentary campaign in Kwekwe Central, Blessing Chebundo, might agree. During a bitter campaign, Mr Chebundo escaped death by a whisker when the Zanu-PF youths who had abducted him and doused him with petrol were unable to light a match. Those who fought in Zimbabwe's war of independence have long monopolised power Mr Mnangagwa's fearsome reputation was made during the civil war which broke out in the 1980s between Mr Mugabe's Zanu party and the Zapu party of Joshua Nkomo. As national security minister, he was in charge of the Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO), which worked hand in glove with the army to suppress Zapu. Thousands of civilians - mainly ethnic Ndebeles, seen as Zapu supporters - were killed in a campaign known as Gukurahundi, before the two parties merged to form Zanu-PF. Among countless other atrocities carried out by the North Korean-trained Fifth Brigade of the army, villagers were forced at gunpoint to dance on the freshly dug graves of their relatives and chant pro-Mugabe slogans. Mr Mnangagwa has denied any role in the massacres, but the wounds are still painful and many party officials, not to mention voters, in Matabeleland might find it hard to back Mr Mnangagwa. He does enjoy the support of many of the war veterans who led the campaign of violence against the white farmers and the opposition from 2000. They remember him as one of the men who, following his military training in China and Egypt, directed the fight for independence in the 1960s and 1970s. He also attended the Beijing School of Ideology, run by the Chinese Communist Party. Mr Mnangagwa's official profile says he was the victim of state violence after being arrested by the white-minority government in the former Rhodesia in 1965, when the ""crocodile gang"" he led helped blow up a train near Fort Victoria (now Masvingo). ""He was tortured, severely resulting in him losing his sense of hearing in one ear,"" the profile says. ""Part of the torture techniques involved being hanged with his feet on the ceiling and the head down. The severity of the torture made him unconscious for days."" As he said he was under 21 at the time, he was not executed but instead sentenced to 10 years in prison. ""He has scars from that period. He was young and brave,"" a close friend of Mr Mnangagwa once said, asking not to be named. ""Perhaps that explains why he is indifferent. Horrible things happened to him when he was young."" Have Zimbabwe's generals turned into democrats? The crusader taking on Zimbabwe's 'crocodile' Zimbabwe's exiled white farmers return Snapping at the heels of Zimbabwe's 'crocodile' The age factor His ruthlessness, which it could be argued he learnt from his Rhodesian torturers, is said to have been seen again in 2008 when he reportedly masterminded Zanu-PF's response to Mr Mugabe losing the first round of the president election to long-time rival Morgan Tsvangirai. The military and state security organisations unleashed a campaign of violence against opposition supporters, leaving hundreds dead and forcing thousands from their homes. Mr Tsvangirai then pulled out of the second round and Mr Mugabe was re-elected. Mr Mnangagwa has not commented on allegations he was involved in planning the violence, but an insider in the party's security department later confirmed that he was the political link between the army, intelligence and Zanu-PF. He was seen as Mr Mugabe's right-hand man - that is until the former first lady Grace Mugabe became politically ambitious and tried to edge him out. Their rivalry took a bizarre turn when he fell ill in August 2017 at a political rally led by former President Mugabe and had to be airlifted to South Africa. Grace Mugabe (right) bit off more than she could chew by taking on Mr Mnangagwa His supporters suggested that a rival group within Zanu-PF had poisoned him and appeared to blame ice cream from Mrs Mugabe's dairy firm. In his first words to cheering supporters after Mr Mugabe's resignation, he spoke about this plot and another plan to ""eliminate"" him. He has also blamed a group linked to the former first lady for an explosion in June at a Zanu-PF rally in Bulawayo in which two people died. But in a BBC interview, he said the country was safe, told foreign investors not to worry and sought to dispel his ruthless reputation: ""I am as soft as wool. I am a very soft person in life."" This video can not be played Mnangagwa: Criminal will be hounded down, but Zimbabwe is safe His youngest son, a Harare DJ known as St Emmo, blames his reticence for his fearsome reputation. ""He was a good father, very very strict. He doesn't say much and I think that's what frightens people - like: 'What is he thinking?'"" Nick Mangwana, Zanu-PF representative in the UK, accepts that the Zimbabwe's new leader is ""not the most eloquent"". ""He's not pally-pally but more of a do-er, more of a technocrat."" But in his six months in power he has fully embraced Twitter and Facebook - after the Bulawayo blast he posted a message reiterating the strength his Christian faith gives him.

Fixing the economy is what is paramount now. Zimbabweans are on average 15% poorer now than they were in the 1980s.

"Gen Constantino Chiwenga, 61, is being hailed as a political saviour after he led the military takeover in Zimbabwe, however he is under sanctions from the European Union and the US - for his role in a brutal crackdown on the opposition, and over the seizure of white-owned farms. Zimbabweans took to the streets on Saturday to demand President Robert Mugabe's resignation, holding aloft placards which declared: ""Zimbabwe army - the voice of the people."" Pastor Patrick Mugadza, hounded by the police in January this year for predicting that the 93-year-old leader would die in nine months' time, went as far as to announce that he intended to name his son after the general. ""My wife is very, very pregnant. When the boy comes, I will be naming him after you, General Chiwenga,"" Zimbabwe's privately owned NewsDay newspaperquoted him as saying in an audio message,external. Gen Chiwenga says he stepped in to end the economic suffering of Zimbabweans Yet, Gen Chiwenga played a central role in keeping Mr Mugabe in power after he lost elections to his main rival, Morgan Tsvangirai of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), in 2008, amid reports that Mr Mugabe was going to accept defeat. ""He told Mugabe: 'We can't lose elections. We can't hand power to the MDC. We are going to obliterate them,"" UK-based Africa confidential magazine editor Patrick Smith told the BBC, adding that he carried out the operation with Emmerson Mnangagwa, the man Gen Chiwenga is trying to install as Mr Mugabe's successor as president. ""They are joined at the hip, with Mnangagwa the senior partner,"" Mr Smith said. After a long delay, the official results were announced, saying that Mr Tsvangirai had not gained the 50% required for victory and so a second round was needed. Before the run-off, pro-Zanu-PF militias backed by the security forces attacked opposition supporters around the country, beating, raping and killing. Mr Tsvangirai pulled out of the second round and Mr Mugabe remained in power. This opposition supporter was one of thousands who said their homes were attacked by pro-Zanu-PF militias Gen Chiwenga joined the guerrilla war against white minority rule in the then Rhodesia as a teenager and got military training in Mozambique and Tanzania. After independence, he received British training, as a new army, made up of ex-guerrillas and soldiers of the former white minority regime, was formed. Power in Zimbabwe is monopolised by those who fought the 1970s war of independence Recalling his ex-student in an interview with the UK-basedSunday Times newspaper, retired Lt-Col Zach Freeth, 76, said Gen Chiwenga  was once caught cheating,external, and while he was deciding what to do with him the next morning, he received news that that the ex-guerrilla fighter, then in his 20s, had shot himself in the chest twice but had miraculously survived. Lt-Col Freeth said the incident was forgotten, but when Gen Chiwenga was appointed defence chief in 2003 he invited him to his home. ""He gave me his card and said: 'If you ever need anything...' We both knew what he was referring to."" Lt-Col Freeth was quoted as saying: ""I knew him very well. I probably did too good a job."" Many Zimbabweans are hoping that the army's intervention will lead to the downfall of Mr Mugabe A Zimbabwean lawyer, who has met Gen Chiwenga on several occasions, offered a different perspective of the army chief. ""He is fearless, and as tough as nails,"" the lawyer, who asked not to be identified, told the BBC. ""In terms of his political outlook, he is a Pan-Africanist at heart. He abhors the notion that Western values are superior. He believes in equal recognition, and that comes from the heart,"" the lawyer added. Now married to Mary Chiwenga - a former model and ex-wife of footballer Shingi Kazwondera - Gen Chiwenga was involved in a messy divorce about five years ago when he ended his marriage to his then-wife, Jocelyn. At the time, the privately owned NewZimbabwe.com news site reported that it had seen court papers in which Gen Chiwenga alleged that his wife used to beat him up, and even thrashed his office at military headquarters. She hit back, alleging that she was, in fact, the victim, and their marriage ran into trouble because he was having an affair with his current wife. President Mugabe's plan to anoint his wife, Grace, as his successor caused the crisis Gen Chiwenga's messy divorce enhanced, rather than damaged, his reputation among his troops. As one soldier told the BBC: ""The general is a very patient man. Look at how his relationship with Jocelyn was, but he waited for the right time to call it off."" His second wife obtained a degree from a university where Mr Mugabe is the chancellor just two days after the general took power. Mr Mugabe conferred degrees on more than 3,000 students, in his first public appearance since being put under house arrest. However, Mrs Chiwenga failed to attend. President Robert Mugabe was to have conferred a degree on the general's wife The veteran leader's appearance in public was intended to show that the general was treating him kindly. Said the soldier: ""Gen Chiwenga is a man of the people, a hard-working person who stands for the truth. He is an achiever.... No matter what is happening, the president will never win."" The army chief put Mr Mugabe under house arrest after the president had sacked the general's close ally Vice-President Mnangagwa, in a move seen as an attempt to install the Mr Mugabe's wife, Grace, as his successor. Days earlier, Gen Chiwenga had warned that ""the current purging, which is clearly targeting members of the party with a liberation background, must stop forthwith"". Gen Chiwenga then went to China, and Mr Mugabe's allies in the security forces planned to arrest him on his return, Mr Smith said. But the general got wind of the plot, and a strong contingent of  loyalist troops arrived at the airport, to prevent his detention. Shortly afterwards, the army chief took power, but insisted that he was not staging a coup. Zimbabwe's army says the worsening economic crisis threatens national security The army said it had intervened to arrest the ""criminals"" around Mr Mugabe, a reference to the political faction headed by Mrs Mugabe, and to end the economic suffering of Zimbabweans. His intervention caught Zimbabweans by surprise but, as the lawyer who has observed his career closely, said: ""Once you cross a certain path, he does not hesitate to act. However, he respects Mugabe and will want him to go out in the most dignified way possible. ""He is genuinely worried about the economic crisis and sees it as a threat to national security. So, he wants the politicians to start dealing with it, and he did not think the G40 faction [headed by Mrs Mugabe] would,"" said the lawyer. Gen Chiwenga flanked Mr Mugabe when he addressed the nation on Sunday night, vowing to remain in office despite the intense pressure on him to leave office. The army chief helped the president with his papers, as he struggled to read his long speech, and his officers saluted Mr Mugabe, still their commander-in-chief. ""It was theatre intended to show that the military are not bully boys picking on a nonagenarian. They want this to be sorted out as amicably as possible,"" Africa Confidential's Mr Smith said.

"At least 50 people have been killed in a suicide bombing in the eastern Nigerian state of Adamawa, police say. A bomber struck inside a mosque packed with worshippers during morning prayers in the town of Mubi. Witness Abubakar Sule told AFP news agency that it appeared the bomber was part of the congregation. No-one has said they were behind the bombing but the Islamist militants Boko Haram typically target crowded places in northern Nigeria. Some 20,000 people have been killed in Boko Haram's eight-year insurgency. The BBC's Ishaq Khalid reports that Boko Haram militants have recently stepped up suicide bombings in Nigeria's north-east after the military recaptured territories previously controlled by the group. At least 45 people were killed in a suicide bomb attack in the same state last December. In that attack two female suicide bombers detonated their explosives in a busy market. Founded in 2002 Known locally as Boko Haram, meaning ""Western education is forbidden"" Launched military operations in 2009 to create Islamic state Designated a terrorist group by US in 2013 Declared a caliphate in areas it controlled in 2014 Most territory recaptured by army Who are Boko Haram?

"This video can not be played The crashes happened in the Scottish Borders and near Inverness (some people may find images in this report distressing) Three deaths at a rally in the Scottish Borders could have been avoided if people had been clearly banned from standing in the area where the crash took place, a sheriff has ruled. A fatal accident inquiry was held into the deaths at the Jim Clark Rally in 2014, and a fourth fatality at the Snowman Rally near Inverness in 2013. Sheriff Kenneth Maciver found no reasonable precautions could have avoided the death at the Snowman Rally. A joint inquiry examined both events. Iain Provan, 64, Elizabeth Allan, 63, and Len Stern, 71, died at the Jim Clark Rally. Joy Robson, 51, lost her life at the Snowman Rally the previous year. Elizabeth Allan, Len Stern and Iain Provan died at the Jim Clark Rally in 2014, while Joy Robson, right, died at the Snowman Rally in 2013 The inquiry found,externalthat all four had died from ""multiple injuries"" after being struck by the cars, which had experienced an ""involuntary loss of control"". The sheriff said he found no defects in the system of working at the Snowman Rally, and that no precautions might have avoided the death. However, he said that the deaths at the Jim Clark event might have been avoided had an area north of the Leet bridge been ""created, delineated and identified"" so it ""clearly prohibited spectators or photographers from standing anywhere in that area"". He also identified a ""weak, ambiguous, and ultimately inadequate verification system"" for checking the proper performance of the work of stage commanders or stage setup crews in identifying the areas which were prohibited to spectators for safety reasons. The sheriff delivered a string of recommendations including: all rallies should have clear and properly prepared set-up arrangements shared with marshals so they are clear of precise prohibited areas at least one safety car should have a specific remit to ensure prohibited areas are clearly marked rally organisers should keep a record of crashes or ""near misses"" to identify areas where spectators might be at risk of injury the introduction of a warning light system in rally cars to ensure they can be stopped as quickly as possible consideration should be given to training marshals to deal with situations where spectators put themselves on a live rally track. The sheriff criticised the verification system at the Jim Clark Rally A spokesman for the Jim Clark Rally said: ""Those involved in the organisation of the rally have received a copy of the sheriff's determination. ""This is quite a lengthy report which will have to be read and digested. ""After which the senior officials will meet up to discuss it and its findings."" Donald Martin suffered a shattered pelvis in the crash at the Jim Clark Rally Donald Martin, from Renfrew was among those injured in the Jim Clark Rally crash. He suffered a shattered pelvis, seven fractured ribs and injuries to his leg. He had been watching the rally with his sister-in-law Ms Allan, her partner Mr Provan and his friend Mr Stern. He told BBC Scotlandthey believed they were in a ""safe area"". ""Where we stood there was no signage to state that there were no spectators allowed to stand there and we were even allowed to stand behind the taped area and considered it a safe area,"" he said. ""We didn't get moved in any way. We assumed it was safe. The organisers didn't tell us anything different. They came through with the spectator control cars and nobody moved us back from the taped area."" Speaking ahead of the publication of the sheriff's findings, he said he hoped rallying overall would be made a ""lot safer"" from a spectator point of view. Andrew Henderson, from Thompsons Solicitors, issued a statement on behalf of Ms Robson's family. ""For Joy's children this was never about trying to stop rallying but rather to improve safety for the spectators,"" he said. ""They always believed that the best way to do this was through the FAI process so that evidence could be properly evaluated and recommendations made. ""This is a very difficult time for them but they are absolutely resolute in their wish that no other family should ever go through the horror they have and that rallying is made as safe for its fans as it can possibly be."" Rob Jones, chief executive of the Motor Sports Association, welcomed the swift publication of the determination and its ""thoroughness"". ""We acknowledge the sheriff's analysis of the circumstances leading up to each accident, in both cases arising in the context of events that were organised by what were stated to be experienced volunteers demonstrating the highest levels of dedication and responsibility,"" he said. ""At this stage, we require more time to fully consider the sheriff's recommendations and we will offer our response as soon as we are able to do so. In the meantime, we wish to reiterate our sincere sympathies to the victims' families."" Plans to hold a hearing into both accidentswere announced almost a year ago. The Crown Office said new legislation, making possible to hold a single hearing into deaths in different parts of Scotland, would allow it to hold such an inquiry for the first time. The aim was to examine the full circumstances of the accidents and ""help to avoid such incidents happening in the future"". The Crown Office said the two events raised ""similar questions in relation to spectator safety at rallies"", and that the Lord Advocate felt it was in the public interest for the issues to be explored together. Edinburgh Sheriff Court heard from a wide range of witnesses to both crashes. The inquiry began in mid-July with a rally driver describing howhis car went out of control before hitting a spectator at the Snowman event. Ms Robson's son, Dean, also gave evidence of the moments leading up to his mother's death. After a couple of weeks, attention turned to the events at the Jim Clark Rally where three people died. A co-driver at the rally recountedhow she had tried to give medical aid to people at the scene. The driver of the car involved in the crash broke downas he told the inquiry he saw a woman ""flying in the air"".

"This video can not be played Benedict Allen said he made a video for his family in case he died whilst on expedition Explorer Benedict Allen encountered a tribal war, was caught in electrical storms and fell ill with malaria and dengue fever on an ill-fated jungle trek in Papua New Guinea, he has said. A search was mounted last week after Mr Allen missed planned flights. He was rescued by helicopter a few days later. Speaking to his friend, the BBC's Frank Gardner, Mr Allen, 57, said he was weak from malaria but was ""bouncing back"". His worst moment had been making a video will for his family, he said. Mr Allen, a father of three young children, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he never took satellite phones or GPS with him on expeditions, but might consider doing so in the future. His family's distress at his apparent disappearance appeared across newspapers, TV and radio, and prompted the Daily Mail, a British newspaper, to send a helicopter into the jungle to rescue him.

Now back in the UK, he said he was weak from malaria - the sixth time he has had it - and ""not that sharp mentally"". Mr Allen denied the search and rescue was a publicity stunt to raise his profile. ""I videoed all of this and you can see me deteriorating with malaria,"" he told Today. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Allen, who has filmed a number of his adventures for BBC documentaries, said he had not got lost, but events had seemed to conspire against him. ""I always knew exactly where I was, things just began to go wrong,"" he said. The trip had been hampered by a massive storm which swept away a vine bridge over a river. He had also started to feel the symptoms of malaria and his tablets had become sodden in the wet. The final straw, he said, was when he discovered there was a war going on ahead of him and he could not get out. ""I had to make my way to the nearest airstrip and try to get any local plane to come in,"" he said. He filmed an appeal on his video camera asking for a message to his children, aged 10, seven and two, and wife, Lenka, to be taken to the British High Commission if he died. Allow Twitter content?

Asked if this latest venture had been part of a mid-life crisis, Mr Allen said he saw himself as a professional - ""a risk calculator, not a risk taker"". ""On the very day the helicopter came, I had been gearing up to do a last walk out. ""I thought I was 80-85% likely to be successful, so I hadn't given up,"" he said, in an interview from west London. ""I wasn't expecting to be rescued. ""I never asked to be rescued but when it came - for the sake of my family - I thought 'I've got to do this'."" Mr Allen set out in October for Papua New Guinea to try to find the reclusive Yaifo tribe, who he first met 30 years ago. The rainforest was, he said, an ""extraordinary place that can work to pull you apart"" - the ""leeches, the constant rain, trees thumping down in the night, sleeping in a sort of swamp"". Among his travelling companions, natives of the rainforest, he knew he was the weakest and, after three weeks, knew he was ""falling apart"". This video can not be played In a recent documentary Benedict Allen described his experiences of living in Papua New Guinea Explaining his reasoning behind travelling alone without a phone, he said he tried to immerse himself in other people's worlds. His back-up was the local people who were always friendly to him, he told BBC's Victoria Derbyshire, in his first TV interview. ""The forest to them is not a threat. It's their home and gives them their food, shelter, medicine, so I had a resource."" He also defended himself against accusations he was ""an imperialist going in to see a lost tribe"". ""It wasn't like that. I simply had the privilege 30 years ago to meet these people. ""I wanted to see that they were alive and well - and they were. ""It was magnificent - a great welcome.""

"Most of the 10,000 cases that could be affected involved traffic offences Around 50 drug-driving prosecutions have been dropped because original test results may have been ""manipulated"". More than 10,000 cases, including violent crime, may have been affected, police chiefs said. They probed Randox Testing Services in Manchester after two men were arrested on suspicion of perverting the course of justice in February. BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said it was ""the biggest forensic science scandal in the UK for decades"". Lawyers for two people convicted over road deaths are now seeking to take their cases to the Court of Appeal. Concerns have also been raised about thousands of drug test results relied on by the civil courts to determine child custody issues and employment cases. Whilst 1,500 retests will be carried out by the end of the year, thousands more will have to take place in 2018 to check the results. However, not all samples will be able to be re-tested as some are no longer viable because of their quality or quantity. James Vaughan, from the NPCC, said this was the situation for many of the 50 cases dropped that were due to go to trial. Not every court was sympathetic to requests for proceedings to be adjourned, which in turn led to more cases being dropped, he added. By BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw Most of the 10,000 cases that could be affected involved traffic offences The scale of the re-testing that will now have to take place, together with a dearth of suitably-qualified experts, is such that police reckon it will be three years before all the re-testing is completed. I think that's a conservative estimate - it does not include the re-testing that may have to be done in non-criminal cases. The impact on an overstretched criminal justice system, where there are already delays in examining forensic evidence, can't be under-estimated; neither can the effect this will all have on public confidence. It will also doubtless raise questions about the decision to close down the government-owned Forensic Science Service in 2012, though private companies already played a big part in scientific testing before then. A total of 42 police forces across the country sent data to the laboratory for testing. Of the 10,000 cases that could have been affected, 75% were traffic offences, such as drug driving, the National Police Chiefs' Council said. Other cases included violent crime, sexual offences and unexplained deaths. So far, re-tests on samples involved in sexual offence cases, violence or homicide have showed no change. Potential data manipulation at a different facility, Trimega Laboratories, is also being investigated by Greater Manchester Police, said the NPCC. In these incidents, child protection and family court cases could be affected. Nick Hurd, the minister for policing, fire and criminal justice, said all tests carried out by Trimega between 2010 and 2014were currently being treated as ""potentially unreliable"",external. He also said due to ""poor record-keeping practices"", it may not be possible to identify all the customers affected. The Forensic Services Regulator said it had asked all major centres to carry out an audit of their cases to look at whether the issue was more widespread, but no evidence was uncovered. Gillian Tully, from the regulator, said: ""If there was large-scale manipulation going on across the board, I do expect it would have been found during that audit."" Nick Freeman, a solicitor who has defended clients who were inaccurately tested for drugs by Randox, said: ""It's absolutely imperative that the public have total confidence in a thoroughly reliable forensic science service, because we need to be sure that the results that are produced are 100% accurate. ""If they're not, innocent people are going to lose their children, be incarcerated, have their lives destroyed, on the basis of an entirely false premise."" Mr Hurd added: ""The government recognises the seriousness of this issue and the potential impact on public confidence in the use of forensic science within the justice system. ""The senior judiciary are aware and government officials are working with the police to monitor the scale of the issue, as information emerges.""

"RT has run a series of ad campaigns on the London Underground Google is to ""derank"" stories from Kremlin-owned publications Russia Today (RT) and Sputnik in response to allegations about election meddling by President Putin's government. Alphabet chairman Eric Schmidt said the search giant needed to deal with the spread of misinformation. RT has been described by US intelligence agencies as ""Russia's state-run propaganda machine"". The publications said the move was a form of censorship. Speaking at the Halifax International Security Forum, Mr Schmidt said: ""We're well aware of this one, and we're working on detecting this kind of scenario you're describing and deranking those kinds of sites."" He then named two of Russia's biggest media outlets: RT, a TV and online news organisation, and Sputnik, an online media network. ""I am strongly not in favour of censorship. I am very strongly in favour of ranking. It's what we do,"" he added. ""It's a very legitimate question as to how we rank, A or B, right? And we do the best we can in millions and millions of rankings every day,"" said Mr Schmidt. But he added that it was a constant tug-of-war altering the search giant's algorithms to detect ""weaponised"" information because those seeking to manipulate the news agenda ""will get better tools too"". The comments drew an angry response from the two publications, which have always defended themselves as legitimate news organisations. ""Good to have Google on record as defying all logic and reason: facts aren't allowed if they come from RT, 'because Russia' - even if we have Google on Congressional record saying they've found no manipulation of their platform or policy violations by RT,""Sputnik and RT editor-in-chief Margarita Simonyan said in a statement published on RT.,external In October, Twitter announced that it would no longer allow advertisements from RT and Sputnik. And in November, RT was forced to register itself as a '""foreign agent"" by the US Department of Justice. The broadcaster is fighting the order in court. Russia has repeatedly denied claims that it interfered in the 2016 presidential elections.

BBC World Affairs Editor John Simpson writes: Most people assumed that
the only way Robert Mugabe would give up being president was to die in his
bed. He probably thought so too. In fact the last of the old-style
1970s and 80s liberation leaders most untypically resigned in writing. Perhaps that says something about the way the world has changed in the 21st century. No storming the presidential palace, no ugly
end at the hands of a crowd like Colonel Gaddafi, no execution by firing squad
like President Ceausescu of Romania, no hanging like Saddam Hussein. Zimbabwe, in spite of everything Robert Mugabe visited upon it, is essentially a peaceable, gentle country.  And despite all the immense crimes for which he was responsible, he is in some ways an intellectual, rather than a brutal thug. Heâll be remembered for the massacres in Matabeleland in the 1980s, for the farm invasions of the 1990s and later, and for the brutal repression of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change when they seemed on course to win the 2008 presidential election. The man who seems about to take his place, former vice-president Emmerson Mnangagwe, was deeply involved in most of those crimes, yet people in Zimbabwe - like the outside world - will be so relieved to see Mugabe go that they will be tempted to forget all that. Theyâll also forget the few unquestionably good things Robert Mugabe did. Zimbabwe, for instance, has an extraordinarily high literacy rate, because of him. But thatâs certainly not what heâll be remembered for.   During his first years in office, Mugabe was feted by leaders across the world, including Cuba's Fidel Castro. See more pictures from his life in office, here. From an icon of his nation's liberation to a cartoonish dictator - what was Robert Mugabe's rule like? For those who haven't followed the former president, the BBC's Joseph Winter has condensed decades of Mugabe's political career: Even after 37 years in power, Mr Mugabe still maintained the same worldview - the patriotic socialist forces of his Zanu-PF party were still fighting the twin evils of capitalism and colonialism.

Following their report that former vice president Emmerson Mnangagwa will be sworn in as vice president in the coming days, Reuters now says he will serve until 2018. The chief whip of ruling party Zanu-PF, Lovemore Matuke, told the news agency that Mr Mnangagwa would serve the remainder of Mugabe's term. Under the current schedule, the next
general elections could be held as late as September 2018. The Visionguinee news website reports... BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Guinean president and current African Union chief, Alpha

an ""African hero"". ""It is a shame that he is leaving through the back door and 
that he is forsaken by the parliament,"" he added. Mr Conde said that the presidential election 
should be held in 2018 and that the African Union will offer 
all its support to Zimbabwe for its organisation. Reuters news agency reports that Mr Emmerson Mnangagwa - the former and briefly exiled vice-president - will be sworn in as president on either Wednesday or Thursday.

BBC World Affairs Editor John Simpson writes: Most people assumed that
the only way Robert Mugabe would give up being president was to die in his
bed. He probably thought so too. In fact the last of the old-style
1970s and 80s liberation leaders most untypically resigned in writing. Perhaps that says something about the way the world has changed in the 21st century. No storming the presidential palace, no ugly
end at the hands of a crowd like Colonel Gaddafi, no execution by firing squad
like President Ceausescu of Romania, no hanging like Saddam Hussein. Zimbabwe, in spite of everything Robert Mugabe visited upon it, is essentially a peaceable, gentle country.  And despite all the immense crimes for which he was responsible, he is in some ways an intellectual, rather than a brutal thug. Heâll be remembered for the massacres in Matabeleland in the 1980s, for the farm invasions of the 1990s and later, and for the brutal repression of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change when they seemed on course to win the 2008 presidential election. The man who seems about to take his place, former vice-president Emmerson Mnangagwe, was deeply involved in most of those crimes, yet people in Zimbabwe - like the outside world - will be so relieved to see Mugabe go that they will be tempted to forget all that. Theyâll also forget the few unquestionably good things Robert Mugabe did. Zimbabwe, for instance, has an extraordinarily high literacy rate, because of him. But thatâs certainly not what heâll be remembered for.   During his first years in office, Mugabe was feted by leaders across the world, including Cuba's Fidel Castro.

"This video can not be played Robert Mugabe refused to resign and instead said: ""The congress is due... I will preside over its processes"". Zimbabwe's anticipated political transition is a complicated process with no obvious answers. Since the military took control of the country last Wednesday, difficult negotiations have been under way. They culminated in President Robert Mugabe's defiant message on Sunday night, vowing to stay put and confounding expectations that he would resign. ""I was surprised,"" says Evan Mawarire, pastor and activist behind#ThisFlag,external, a protest movement which began on social media. But in hindsight, he says the statement was an attempt to make the process democratic and constitutional. ""It would have been awkward for him to resign flanked by army generals,"" adds Pastor Mawarire. Since the military took control of Zimbabwe, they've insisted their action was not a coup - and referred to Mr Mugabe as the ""commander-in-chief"". There have also been calls from the international community to maintain constitutional order. But the transition many in Zimbabwe and abroad hope for is still an intricate process. There have been calls for the President to initiate the process himself by stepping down. But a resignation may not be the quick solution the forces behind the military take-over would have hoped for. In the event of Mr Mugabe stepping down, the country's constitution dictates that the vice-president would take over as acting president for a period of 90 days. As things stand, that would be 77-year-old Phelekezela Mphoko. President Mugabe now faces impeachment on charges that he ""allowed his wife to usurp constitutional power"" The former military commander is seen as a close ally of First Lady Grace Mugabe, a polarising figure whose ambition to succeed her husband has been blamed for the current political crisis. In recent weeks, she has been at loggerheads with former Vice-President Emmerson Mnangagwa. His sacking was viewed as a strategy to clear the way for Mrs Mugabe to ascend. But the military intervened in what was largely a fall-out within the ruling Zanu-PF, pre-empting her anticipated promotion. These intrigues leave her ally, Mr Mphoko, in an unfavourable position as the likely successor. He is in a weaker position now having been sacked from the ruling party over the weekend. In the absence of a resignation, the ruling party would seek change from within. The groundwork was laid on Sunday in an unprecedented decision by the party's central committee to fire Mr Mugabe as party leader and install Mr Mnangagwa in his place. The next stage is the removal of the president from power through parliament. The proponents of the process need a two thirds majority vote to succeed. Technically, Zanu-PF has a majority in both houses of parliament, but the test will be how many Mugabe loyalists can be convinced to vote him out. In the current environment, the party could benefit from legislators who may have been reluctant to force Mr Mugabe out, but who wouldn't want to drown as the wave of change hits the Southern African country. Things get even more knotty in parliament. Derek Matyszak, a Senior Researcher at the Institute of Security Studies, says the ruling party ""will need the support of [opposition party] Movement for Democratic Change, who will in turn want to cut a deal."" MDC leader Morgan Tsavangirai last week called President Mugabe to resign and make way for a transitional arrangement It is not clear on what conditions the MDC would support their political rivals, nor whether Zanu-PF would be willing to dangle the carrot. Senior Zanu-PF officials seem confident about their move to remove the president. ""The last thing they [Zanu-PF] would want is for it to fail,"" adds Mr Matyszak. That, he says, would embolden Mr Mugabe. Also heavily invested in the transition process are Mr Mugabe's fellow independence fighters. They have called for more protests to push him out of power. Saturday saw some of the biggest demonstrations ever witnessed in Zimbabwe. This video can not be played Jubilant protesters in Harare called for President Robert Mugabe to step down The military sanctioned this weekend's demonstrations, and was in turn praised by the crowds for ""delivering the second independence"". But it all appears choreographed to push their agenda and give the process some legitimacy for being ""people-driven"". There is no doubt a lot has changed. Pastor Mawarire had been leading the #ThisFlag protest long before the military intervention. ""If we had done two weeks ago what we did on Saturday, we'd have been arrested and charged with subversion,"" he says. He was arrested and charged in September for urging Zimbabweans to rise up and fight against the deteriorating economic situation in the country. It has taken bold and daring manoeuvres to get to this point in Zimbabwe's politics. Engaging the reverse gear now may prove costly, particularly for the architects of change. Defying a strongman was never going to be easy. President Mugabe has survived huge challenges during his 37-year rule including paralysing economic sanctions imposed by the West and bruising competition from a once vibrant opposition. In many cases, it has been at a huge cost - seen in the economy contracting and the loss of civilian lives. But the current attempts to end his rule come from his traditional support base - his own party, war veterans and the military. It is hard to imagine how he could survive for long. But in the midst of political turmoil, Zimbabwe remains calm and optimistic.

"If you're 26 and annoyed about paying the full fare for your train travel, the Budget may offer a reprieve. The government has said people up to 30 years-old will now be able to buy a Â£30 railcard for discounted train travel. The move - set to be announced in Wednesday's Budget - would be an extension of the current young person's railcard for those aged 16 to 25. The so called millennials' card will be available from spring next year, and offer up to a third off non-peak fares. This means the new railcard is unlikely to be much use for regular commuters, as railcard discounts are restricted at peak times, usually before 10am. Reaction to the new card was mixed with some people saying it would have little impact on them and others welcoming the move. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Jimmy Connaughton, from St Albans Regular train user Jimmy Connaughton, 29, from St Albans said he was ""very excited"" about the new card which he reckons will save him up to Â£400 a year. ""It's been a long time since I lost the use of my 16-25 year rail card. I'm probably a bit more excited than I should be, but it is just before my 30th birthday,"" he said. The keen Chelsea fan mainly uses trains for travelling to and from football games. ""I go to a lot of matches and I have a multitude of railcards to try to replicate the Student Railcard. I have a Network Railcard [for trains across the south east], a Two Together, for when I travel with my Dad, and a Friends and Family [discounts for up to four adults and children] for other occasions."" He has no truck with those who think the railcard is a meagre gesture to the hard-pressed Millennial: ""True, you can't use it on peak trains but that ship sailed a while ago - anyone used to using student rail cards are used to not travelling on peak trains."" The card is part of a series of Budget measures aimed to attract younger voters after a resurgence in 18 to 29-year-olds voting in June's general election favoured the Labour party. The national roll-out of the card comes after a successful test of the discounted card in East Anglia. Railcards were introduced as a way for train companies to help fill seats during off-peak times. The card for 16 to 25-year-olds has existed in one form or another since 1974. On average, I am told, people who have a rail card at the moment (16 to 25-year-olds) save Â£150 a year. And anything that cuts costs for younger people has got to be a good thing. But there is one critical issue with this new scheme, you won't be able to use the card at peak times. So commuting to your job will be just as expensive... and it's about to get even more pricey. Season tickets go up by 3.6% in January. The highest rise since 2013. You might also like: Apology after train departs seconds early The degrees that make you rich... and the ones that don't Meet the world's youngest self-made billionaire The Treasury said the move would help keep the cost of living down for more young people. However, Andy McDonald, Labour's shadow transport secretary, said: ""Any move that reduces the cost of travel is welcome but the Tories are tinkering around the edges of a broken system. ""Our railway should be run by and for passengers, not private shareholders and foreign governments."" Also on Wednesday, the chancellor is expected to announce a review, led by an independent chair, into airline insolvency arrangements. If follows the recent collapse of Monarch, which left 110,000 passengers without a return flight home. It cost UK taxpayers about Â£60m to bring people back to Britain.

"Norberto RodrÃ­guez, uncle of missing submariner Luis, waits for news Argentina's navy says it is worried about oxygen levels inside the submarine that went missing last Wednesday in the southern Atlantic. Forty-four people are on board the ARA San Juan, which vanished after it reported an electric breakdown. A navy spokesman, Enrique Balbi, said a massive search operation would continue until the vessel was located. Better weather conditions on Tuesday, after days of rough sea, have given new hope to relatives of the missing crew. But Mr Balbi cautioned: ""We are considering all possibilities and obviously the most critical situation would be the fact that we are on the sixth day of oxygen."" The search effort has now been narrowed down to an area of 20km by 20km (12 miles), he added. On Monday, navy officials said that noises picked up by two search vessels did not come from the sub, the second false alarm to hit the search. The ARA San Juan was returning from a routine mission to Ushuaia, near the southern-most tip of South America, when it reported an ""electrical breakdown"". According to naval commander Gabriel Galeazzi, the submarine surfaced and reported the breakdown, which Capt Galeazzi described as a ""short circuit"" in the sub's batteries. The sub was ordered to cut its mission short and return to the naval base in Mar del Plata immediately. According to navy spokesman Enrique Balbi, the captain of the ARA San Juan contacted the naval base once more after reporting the problem. In the message, he reportedly said that the problem had been adequately fixed and that the sub would submerge and proceed towards Mar del Plata naval base. The last contact was made at 07:30 local time (10:30 GMT) on Wednesday 15 November. It is not known what happened to the sub after that contact. Read:What happens when a submarine vanishes Argentine navy protocol stipulates that in peace time, submarines make contact twice a day with the base. When the submarine failed to call in, the Argentine navy began its search for the vessel. Navy commander Carlos Zavalla at that point spoke only of a ""failure to communicate"" and urged relatives of the crew to remain calm. There was no mention by navy officials of the vessel having any problems at the time and rumours of a fire on board were dismissed by the navy's spokesman, Enrique Balbi. On Sunday, relatives of some of the crew said that they had been told in messages sent before contact with the submarine was lost, that there was a problem with the sub's batteries. Naval commander Gabriel Galeazzi told journalists about the mechanical problems on Monday On Monday, naval commander Gabriel Galeazzi confirmed the sub's captain had reported a breakdown on Wednesday describing it as a ""short-circuit"" in the sub's battery system. Capt Galeazzi said that mechanical problems were not uncommon and rarely posed a risk. ""A warship has a lot of backup systems, to allow it to move from one to another when there is a breakdown,"" he said. He also said that the sub had not sent a distress signal to the navy base. There are 44 crew on board the submarine, which is under the command of Pedro MartÃ­n FernÃ¡ndez. Forty-three of the crew are men but there is also one woman, Eliana MarÃ­a Krawczyk. The 35-year-old is the first female officer in Argentina to serve on a submarine. Her family says it was Eliana MarÃ­a Krawczyk's dream to become a submariner Nicknamed ""the queen of the sea"" by her father she comes from OberÃ¡, a city in northern Argentina. Despite having been born and raised far inland, her relatives say that ""she was born to be a submariner"", citing her ""will of steel"" and a passion for her job. The rest of the crew is made up of submariners of varying ages and experience. The sub's engineer, HernÃ¡n RodrÃ­guez, has been on the ARA San Juan for 11 years, local media reported. Submarines are built to be difficult to find and the search has been further hindered by bad weather. The Argentine Navy tweeted a video showing the rough conditions at sea. Allow Twitter content?

Waves of up to six metres in height (19.6ft) have made it difficult for search vessels and planes to spot anything on the sea's surface. Brazil, Chile, Colombia, France, Germany, Peru, South Africa, Uruguay and the UK have all sent either ships or planes to help with the search. The US Navy has deployed two underwater vehicles which use sonar to create images of the sea floor. A Nasa research aircraft has also flown over the search area but failed to spot anything. Despite the failure to find any trace of the sub, the father of one of the crew said relatives remained optimistic. ""In general there's a positive outlook, with the hope that there can be some way of finding them,"" Jorge Villareal said.

"Conservative and unionist MPs want a ""statute of limitations"" to prevent security force members being prosecuted for offences early in the Troubles Sinn FÃ©in's Gerry Adams has expressed concern about a proposed ""amnesty for British crown forces"" allegedly involved in Troubles' offences. Mr Adams said there had been a change to legacy arrangements envisaged under a previous political agreement. He was speaking after meeting Prime Minister Theresa May. Conservative and unionist MPs want a ""statute of limitations"" to prevent security force members being prosecuted for offences early in the Troubles. DUP's Foster warns Irish PM over Brexit Is Sinn FÃ©in leadership a one-horse race? Profile: Gerry Adams Brexit: All you need to know Gerry Adams held talks with Theresa May on Tuesday Mr Adams, the outgoing Sinn FÃ©in leader, said he understood a new section had been added to the 2014Stormont House Agreementand that it was ""about an amnesty for British crown forces"" - the term republicans to describe the Army and police. ""That is an act of bad faith, we weren't told this, we understand the Irish government weren't told this,"" Mr Adams said. ""So how on earth can a British prime minister hope to persuade anybody that there's a possibility of a new dispensation emerging when she takes up this position and her secretary of state takes up this position also?"" A government source told the BBC that their preferred approach remained the proposals set out under the Stormont House Agreement, but that the government wanted, in their consultation, to ask the public what they thought about a statute of limitations. The Irish government said it would ""not look favourably"" on any amnesty measure in Northern Ireland. ""There are no amnesties from prosecution provided for in the Good Friday Agreement or any subsequent agreements including the Stormont House Agreement,""  a spokesman for the Department of Foreign Affairs said. Earlier, the DUP said Sinn FÃ©in must stop glorifying the murders of innocent people. DUP leader Arlene Foster said remarks made about IRA terrorism at Sinn Fein's annual gathering were 'quite disgraceful' Speaking after a separate meeting with Mrs May, DUP leader Arlene Foster said remarks made about IRA terrorism at Sinn FÃ©in's annual gathering were ""quite disgraceful"". She said the DUP would continue to work towards the restoration of devolution. Mr Adams, however, rejected Mrs Foster's allegations, saying they were an excuse not to strike a deal. The Sinn FÃ©in president was accompanied to the Downing Street talks by the party's leader north of the border, Michelle O'Neill, and its vice president, Mary-Lou McDonald. Northern Ireland has been without a devolved administration since January, when the governing parties - the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in -split in a bitter row over a botched green energy scheme. At the Sinn FÃ©in gathering (ard fheis) in Dublin at the weekend, tributes were paid to the late Martin McGuinness. Sinn FÃ©in was viewed as the political wing of the IRA during the Troubles. Party members regularly attend commemorations for IRA members. The Provisional IRA killed almost 1,800 people during its campaign, about 650 of those were civilians. Tributes were paid to the late Martin McGuinness at the Sinn FÃ©in party conference at the weekend One of the loudest cheers of the conference came when delegates were told that the former Stormont deputy first minister, Mr McGuinness, had been a ""proud member of the IRA"". Mrs Foster said she had told Mrs May the glorification of terrorism made the restoration of power sharing in Northern Ireland more difficult. She said the DUP was talking about a deal to restore power sharing that both unionism and nationalism could live with, but she accused Sinn FÃ©in of only being concerned with nationalism. She also criticised calls from Sinn FÃ©in for more direct involvement by both the London and Dublin governments over the political stalemate at Stormont - saying the internal governance of Northern Ireland was a matter for the UK government. The Sinn FÃ©in delegation had been expected to tell Theresa May that instead of direct rule, the British and Irish governments should deliver on equality issues like same-sex marriage and an Irish Language Act. But DUP MP Nigel Dodds was scathing about Sinn FÃ©in's complaints about equal rights. Michelle O'Neill and Gerry Adams are expected to press the government on same-sex marriage and an Irish language act ""When Sinn FÃ©in lectures everybody about rights, remember that the greatest right of all is the right to life,"" said Mr Dodds, who met the prime minister with Mrs Foster. ""It is not just that Sinn FÃ©in have supported IRA terrorism in the past, and the murder of innocent people, but even at the weekend they were continuing to eulogise and glorify the murder of innocent people. ""In a rights-based society, that has got to stop,"" he added. Mrs May said it was clear the issues dividing the parties are relatively small in number, focusing mainly around culture, legacy, identity and the future stability of the devolved institutions. ""While not in any way underestimating the challenges involved, I believe that a way forward can be found and an agreement reached,"" she said. Sinn FÃ©in has called for a British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference to be convened to consider a way forward, but Mrs Foster described that body as a ""talking shop which has not met since 2007"". She said Northern Ireland must not be used as a pawn in ongoing Brexit negotiations, accusing some in Dublin and Brussels of trying torecklessly use Northern Ireland for their own objectives. Sinn FÃ©in said the confidence and supply arrangement between the DUP and the Conservative Party had ""compounded"" the problems the parties faced.

"UN Security Council members cast their vote during a meeting on the election of five members of the International Court of Justice. The International Court of Justice is the principal legal body of the United Nations. It is based in The Hague and its job is to settle disputes between states. Lots of its work is highly technical and not exactly the stuff of the front pages. And let's be honest, many people would probably not have known that one of the 15 judges had always been British ever since the court was set up after the Second World War. But theloss of a British presence around that supreme judicial benchis of huge significance - not just to the court but to the UK's standing in the world. This is how it happened. Five of the 15 judges are elected every three years to ensure continuity. Britain's judge, Sir Christopher Greenwood, was hoping to win re-election for a second nine year term. He is a highly distinguished lawyer and former professor in international law at the LSE. More from James: What is diplomatic protection? What are the UK's commitments to overseas territories? Why Boris Johnson feels he must fix Libya But there was a hitch. Rather unexpectedly, Lebanon's former ambassador to the UN put his hat in the ring. So instead of there being five candidates for five places, now there were six. And the former ambassador, having spent many years at the UN, had enough friends to win the election. He won one of the slots reserved for candidates from Asia. This meant the Indian candidate - Dalveer Bhandari - had to try his luck for a slot normally reserved for Europeans and in this case that meant challenging the UK. In recent days, the four other candidates were elected. But while Sir Christopher won the support of the UN Security Council, the Indian judge was backed by the UN General Assembly. A successful candidate needs a majority of support in both bodies. And after repeated votes, there was deadlock. The Indian government was working hard, twisting arms, lobbying furiously, pulling in favours. The Indian newspapers were full of accusations that the British were using ""dirty tricks"" to try to win. Some commentators compared Britain's behaviour to its old commander in chief of British India, Robert Clive. Few anti-colonialist tropes were left unused. In contrast, British ministers made some telephone calls. The British did consider invoking a little known provision in the UN Charter which allows for an arbitration process known as a ""joint conference"" to try to resolve such an impasse. Matthew Rycroft, the UK's ambassador to the UN, said he was ""pleased"" that a ""close friend like India"" had won. But in the end, the UK chose not to use this process, fearing either it would not get enough support in the UN Security Council, or that the competition would become too bitter and potentially disrupt the UK's economic relations with India. Either way, it means that from early next year, when Sir Christopher stands down, the UK will not have a judge on the ICJ for the first time since 1946. On one level, this reflects a shift in the balance of power at the UN away from the Security Council. Many members on the General Assembly resent the way the Security Council has so much power, particularly the five permanent members. The so-called Group of 77 - which represents a coalition of mostly developing nations - has long been pushing for greater influence. The victory of India over the UK will be seen as a huge success for the G77 in pushing back against the traditional northern powers on the security council. Foreign Office sources pointed out that the UK's ousting from the ICJ is not without precedent. They pointed to France failing to get its candidate onto the International Law Commission last year and Russia's exit from the Human Rights Commission. But it is also true to say that this represents a defeat for the UK itself. This is a failure of UK diplomacy. Downing Street refused to confirm that Theresa May herself got involved in lobbying for this job - they merely said representations have been made at the highest levels of government. But Boris Johnson and his Foreign Office ministers were certainly involved. And they failed. They failed to win enough support in the General Assembly. Matthew Rycroft, the UK's highly rated ambassador to the UN, said the UK had folded because it did not want to take up more of the UN's valuable time, and he said he was ""pleased"" that a ""close friend like India"" had won. Perhaps more frankly, he admitted that the UK was ""naturally disappointed"". However hard the government tries, this defeat at the UN will be seen as a significant diplomatic set back, a symbol of Britain's reduced status on the world stage. Britain tried to win an election - but the community of nations backed the other side, no longer fearing any retribution from the traditional powers, no longer listening to what Britain had to say. Some will blame this on Brexit. That might be a little simplistic. Few countries are as obsessed with Brexit as the UK. It is simply not at the front of their minds. But what is clear is that many countries at the UN were willing to defy Britain and that would have been less likely a few years ago. The government likes to talk of what it calls ""global Britain"", a vision of a buccaneering UK, independent of the EU, promoting its interests and values and trade around the world. The problem is that many believe that vision has not yet been backed up with any policy substance. Instead, rightly or wrongly, many countries see the UK turning in on itself to sort out the complexity of Brexit. They see it as a retreat from the international stage - whatever the Brexiteers argue to the contrary - and these countries are filling the vacuum accordingly. We saw a sign of this earlier in the year in June, when the UN general assembly voted against Britain to refer a dispute between the UK and Mauritius over some islands in the Indian Ocean, to the International Court of Justice. In another age, Britain would perhaps have called in favours, flexed its P5 muscles, and taken the fight to India. But instead it withdrew, at best to take a short term hit probably to avoid a long term economic loss. At worst it simply gave up because it had no alternative and as a result, for the first time in 71 years, the UK will no longer be represented in the world's highest court.

"When the only interaction is with a machine, shopping can be a ""miserable experience"" Automated checkout machines put off about a quarter of older people from going shopping, a survey from a housing charity for the elderly suggests. They can find the automated checkouts ""intimidating"" and ""unfriendly,"" according to the charity, Anchor. Without someone to talk to at the tills, shopping can be a ""miserable experience,"" a spokesman said. The British Retail Consortium said it was important for shops to be welcome destinations for all of the community. The lack of seats in shopping centres or on High Streets can also make older people feel ""shut out"", according to the charity. It also warned that automated checkouts could add to loneliness and isolation among the elderly. ""There was a time when people knew their shopkeepers and could pass the time of day. You can't do that with a machine,"" says Mario Ambrosi, a spokesman for the charity. The report from the charity, produced by the Centre for Future Studies consultancy group, says there is a ""dire need for the High Street to re-invent itself"" if it is going to be accessible and attractive to older people. The study suggests 24% of older people are deterred from shopping by automated checkouts and 60% are worried that there will be a lack of seating if they need to rest. The report says older people can feel ""shut out"" from shopping With rising numbers of older people, the charity says that by the end of the next decade retailers could be missing out on Â£4.5bn per year if pensioners stay away from the shops. ""The technology needs to have some human interaction, it's what gets people into the shops,"" says Mr Ambrosi. He says there are still ""significant numbers"" of older people who are not online and depend on going to the shops - but who find the experience uncomfortable. For the automated checkouts, he says people might feel under pressure ""if they don't respond quickly enough"" to the instructions. It also might mean ""they can have gone shopping without having said 'hello' to a single person - and that's quite a miserable experience,"" he says. Daphne Guthrie, who is approaching her 93rd birthday, says across her lifetime she has seen a complete change in shopping culture - from small, privately owned stores, where shopkeepers knew their customers, to impersonal megastores. ""I wouldn't want everything to be automated,"" says Daphne Guthrie. Mrs Guthrie, from Market Deeping, in Lincolnshire, says she would always choose a till with a human and has never tried the automatic checkouts. She would like shops to be more welcoming to older customers and shopping centres to be less harsh environments for people who might want to stop and chat, particularly those who might not get to talk to many people. ""They should be more friendly - treat me as a person and not just someone who pays the bill. ""I wouldn't want everything to be automated,"" she says, The Campaign to End Loneliness has warned of an estimated 1.2 million people in the UK who have ""chronic"" loneliness. The campaign has highlighted thatautomated checkouts have shut down what might be some people's only chance to talk to someone during the day. Anchor is also promoting the Standing Up 4 Sitting Down campaign to improve seating in shops and the High Street. A spokeswoman for the British Retail Consortium said shops had been trying to incorporate more seating to ""ensure everyone can have an enjoyable shopping experience"". ""As high streets continue to evolve, it's increasingly important they are welcome destinations for people of all parts of the community."" But the increase in automation and self-checkout machines is about costs, the retailers' group said, reflecting the ""diverging costs of labour versus technology"". Caroline Abrahams of Age UK said: ""Clearly there is no single 'older consumer' - people in later life are incredibly diverse in terms of their interests, income and health. ""That's why it's vital that shops and companies do not stereotype  their older customers, whilst also being aware of the ways in which some might need a bit of practical support."" Martin Tett, the Local Government Association's environment spokesman, said councils understood how ""crucial it is that all members of our communities can play a role in our civic life, and that includes making sure our high streets are as accessible as possible"". He said that councils could support partnerships to ""support dementia-friendly communities or age-friendly cities"".

"If you're 26 and annoyed about paying the full fare for your train travel, the Budget may offer a reprieve. The government has said people up to 30 years-old will now be able to buy a Â£30 railcard for discounted train travel. The move - set to be announced in Wednesday's Budget - would be an extension of the current young person's railcard for those aged 16 to 25. The so called millennials' card will be available from spring next year, and offer up to a third off non-peak fares. This means the new railcard is unlikely to be much use for regular commuters, as railcard discounts are restricted at peak times, usually before 10am. Reaction to the new card was mixed with some people saying it would have little impact on them and others welcoming the move. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Jimmy Connaughton, from St Albans Regular train user Jimmy Connaughton, 29, from St Albans said he was ""very excited"" about the new card which he reckons will save him up to Â£400 a year. ""It's been a long time since I lost the use of my 16-25 year rail card. I'm probably a bit more excited than I should be, but it is just before my 30th birthday,"" he said. The keen Chelsea fan mainly uses trains for travelling to and from football games. ""I go to a lot of matches and I have a multitude of railcards to try to replicate the Student Railcard. I have a Network Railcard [for trains across the south east], a Two Together, for when I travel with my Dad, and a Friends and Family [discounts for up to four adults and children] for other occasions."" He has no truck with those who think the railcard is a meagre gesture to the hard-pressed Millennial: ""True, you can't use it on peak trains but that ship sailed a while ago - anyone used to using student rail cards are used to not travelling on peak trains."" The card is part of a series of Budget measures aimed to attract younger voters after a resurgence in 18 to 29-year-olds voting in June's general election favoured the Labour party. The national roll-out of the card comes after a successful test of the discounted card in East Anglia. Railcards were introduced as a way for train companies to help fill seats during off-peak times. The card for 16 to 25-year-olds has existed in one form or another since 1974. On average, I am told, people who have a rail card at the moment (16 to 25-year-olds) save Â£150 a year. And anything that cuts costs for younger people has got to be a good thing. But there is one critical issue with this new scheme, you won't be able to use the card at peak times. So commuting to your job will be just as expensive... and it's about to get even more pricey. Season tickets go up by 3.6% in January. The highest rise since 2013. You might also like: Apology after train departs seconds early The degrees that make you rich... and the ones that don't Meet the world's youngest self-made billionaire The Treasury said the move would help keep the cost of living down for more young people. However, Andy McDonald, Labour's shadow transport secretary, said: ""Any move that reduces the cost of travel is welcome but the Tories are tinkering around the edges of a broken system. ""Our railway should be run by and for passengers, not private shareholders and foreign governments."" Also on Wednesday, the chancellor is expected to announce a review, led by an independent chair, into airline insolvency arrangements. If follows the recent collapse of Monarch, which left 110,000 passengers without a return flight home. It cost UK taxpayers about Â£60m to bring people back to Britain.

"The fire damaged part of the first, second and third floors of the building A woman has died in a fire at a block of flats in north London. She was rescued from the four-storey building in Daleham Garden, Hampstead, in the early hours of Tuesday but died at the scene. London Fire Brigade (LFB) said about 20 people managed to escape from the building before crews arrived. The cause of the fire, which took 60 firefighters about three hours to get under control, is being investigated. The woman who died has not been named. The fire took about three hours to get under control Crews in eight fire engines, along with an aerial appliance, attended the scene after the alarm was raised just before 02:00 GMT. Retired teacher Aura Romero, 72, was one of the residents who had to flee her home, but with no time to take any of her possessions. She said: ""I was already asleep in bed when it happened. ""I heard all these people running and shouting, someone knocked on my door and said: 'Come out! Come out!' ""I was able to get dressed but there was no time for shoes, I was walking around in the street in my socks until a gentleman gave me a coat and some shoes. ""I'm OK physically, but I am obviously quite upset. I don't know where I'm going to live."" About 20 people fled the building before firefighters arrived LFB said the fire had badly damaged the ground and first floors of the building, while the second and third floors and roof were all destroyed. Rupert Barnes had been staying with his fiancÃ©e, who lived in the building. He said: ""The fire brigade arrived within five minutes, but it was pretty clear this was going to be a serious fire just by the way it had taken hold quite quickly. ""It was pretty clear that we [needed to] act pretty quickly to evacuate the building. ""There was one lady who was very good at shouting at everybody, saying 'there was a fire' and to 'get out.'""

"President Mugabe is under pressure from the public and his own Zanu-PF party Zimbabwe's former vice-president, whose sacking led to last week's army takeover, has urged President Robert Mugabe to resign immediately. Emmerson Mnangagwa said he fled abroad two weeks ago when he learned of a plot to kill him, and he would not return until he was sure of his security. Parliament has now begun a session in which the ruling Zanu-PF party is to start impeaching the president. Mr Mugabe is accused of allowing his wife to ""usurp constitutional power"". Speaking from an undisclosed location on Tuesday, Mr Mnangagwa said the 93-year-old president should heed the ""clarion call"" of his people and step down. ""I told the President that I would not return home now until I am satisfied of my personal security, because of the manner and treatment given to me upon being fired,"" he said in a statement. In a bid to resolve the crisis, South African President Jacob Zuma and his Angolan counterpart JoÃ£o LourenÃ§o will travel to Zimbabwe on Wednesday on behalf of southern Africa's regional body, Sadc, the grouping said. Zimbabwe at crossroads - full coverage: Impeachment: Latest updates Mugabe's dwindling options Emmerson Mnangagwa, ""crocodile"" and heir apparent Robert Mugabe - hero or villain? Many in Zanu-PF want Emmerson Mnangagwa to be the next president Analysis by Andrew Harding, BBC News, Harare Emmerson Mnangagwa more or less accused President Mugabe of trying to have him killed. The statement from the former vice-president gave an extraordinary insight into the vicious power struggles that preceded last week's military intervention here. Mr Mnangagwa said his security guards had warned him of plans to ""eliminate"" him, after he was sacked earlier this month. He promptly fled to South Africa. On Monday night, Zimbabwe's army generals claimed that Mr Mnangagwa had agreed to return home as part of a transitional roadmap. That roadmap now sounds like wishful thinking, as parliament here prepares to impeach the president, and Mr Mnangagwa angrily demands that his former boss respects the will of the people or face humiliation. This video can not be played Zimbabwe reacts: ""We need him to resign... our lives are terrible right now"" The president has been in power since independence in 1980. He has won elections, but over the past 15 years these have been marred by violence against political opponents. Above all, Mr Mugabe has presided over a deepening economic crisis. Zimbabweans are on average 15% poorer now than they were in 1980. What triggered moves to oust him was Mr Mnangagwa's dismissal as vice-president two weeks ago. The move was seen by many as clearing the way for Mr Mugabe's wife Grace to succeed her husband as leader. The move riled top soldiers, who stepped in and put Mr Mugabe under house arrest. However he remains president, and in recent days has defied calls from his own party and from protesters to stand down. In a further sign of his dwindling authority, only a handful of his ministers turned up for a cabinet meeting on Tuesday. This video can not be played ""Government for his relatives is not the government for us,"" say locals in President Mugabe's home town Zimbabwe's constitution lists ""serious misconduct"", ""violation"" of the constitution or ""failure to obey, uphold or defend"" it, or ""incapacity"", as grounds for impeachment. On Monday, Zanu-PF member of parliament Paul Mangwana said: ""The main charge is that he has allowed his wife to usurp constitutional power when she has no right to run government. ""He has refused to implement the constitution of Zimbabwe - particularly we had elections for the provincial councils, but up to now they have not been put into office."" This video can not be played Zimbabwe's week of upheaval in two minutes It would start with a motion, to be presented as early as Tuesday afternoon, laying out the charges against Mr Mugabe and his wife. If - as is likely - the motion is approved by a 50% majority in a joint sitting of the National Assembly and the Senate, a committee from both chambers will be appointed to investigate. Should the committee support the charges, the president can then be removed if both houses back them with two-thirds majorities. Paul Mangwana said the process could be fast-tracked and completed by Wednesday, ""because the charges are so clear"".  But others insist the process should take longer. Tendai Biti, a leader of the opposition MDC, insists the constitution allows for a fair hearing. ""Mugabe as the accused person will obviously be entitled to legal representation,"" Mr Biti told the BBC. The full process, he added, could take between one and three weeks. If the impeachment is fast-tracked, he said, ""the process will not be legitimate or credible"". He will be succeeded by the vice-president. The military would like to see Mr Mnangagwa step into that role. But it is current Vice-President Phelekezela Mphoko, a supporter of Grace Mugabe, who would in theory assume the post. It is not clear if Mr Mnangagwa could be restored to his former position. Why China matters to Zimbabwe's leaders Robert Mugabe - hero or villain?

"The allegations made against Charlie Rose span from the 1990s to 2011 US talk show host Charlie Rose has been suspended by several television networks following allegations of sexual harassment. Eight women accused the veteran TV interviewer of inappropriate behaviour,externalin a report by the Washington Post. ""These allegations are extremely disturbing and we take them very seriously,"" CBS News said. PBS and Bloomberg have also suspended him. Mr Rose has apologised, but said not all the allegations were accurate. They span from the 1990s to 2011 and include groping, lewd telephone calls and unwanted advances.

"ICJ judges sitting in the Hague in December 2015 The UK is to lose its seat on the International Court of Justice for the first time since the United Nations' principal legal body began in 1946. Sir Christopher Greenwood was hoping to be elected for a second nine-year term on the bench of 15 judges in the Hague. The government withdrew his candidacy after six rounds of votes with India's Dalveer Bhandari ended in a deadlock. Sir Christopher was backed by theUN Security Councilbut his rival was chosen by the General Assembly. A successful candidate needs to gain a majority of support in both bodies. The UK's move means Mr Bhandari will be able take up a position on theICJ,external, alongside four other judges already elected. The UK government had considered invoking a little-known arbitration process but in the end chose to take Sir Christopher out of the race. The British ambassador to the UN, Matthew Rycroft, said he was ""naturally disappointed"". Mr Rycroft said: ""The UK has concluded that it is wrong to continue to take up the valuable time of the Security Council and the UN General Assembly with further rounds of elections.... ""If the UK could not win in this run-off, then we are pleased that it is a close friend like India that has done so instead. We will continue to cooperate closely with India, here in the UN and globally."" He said the UK would continue to support the work of the ICJ ""in line with our commitment to the importance of the rule of law in the UN system and in the international community more generally"". Downing Street refused to confirm that UK Prime Minister Theresa May was involved in lobbying for Sir Christopher to get the job, saying only that representations were made at the highest levels of government. By James Landale, BBC diplomatic correspondent However hard the government tries, this defeat at the UN will be seen as a significant diplomatic set back, a symbol of Britain's reduced status on the world stage. Britain tried to win an election but the community of nations backed the other side, no longer fearing any retribution from the traditional powers, no longer listening to what Britain had to say. Some will blame this on Brexit - that might be a little simplistic. Few countries are as obsessed with Brexit as the UK. But what is clear is that many countries at the UN were willing to defy Britain and that would have been less likely a few years ago. The government likes to talk of what it calls ""global Britain"", a vision of a buccaneering UK, independent of the EU, promoting its interests and values and trade around the world. The problem is that many believe that vision has not yet been backed up with any policy substance. Instead, rightly or wrongly, many countries see the UK turning in on itself to sort out the complexity of Brexit. They see it as a retreat from the international stage - whatever the Brexiteers argue to the contrary - and these countries are filling the vacuum accordingly. How UK lost International Court of Justice place to India France and Russia, which along with the UK, US and China make up the permanent members of the UN Security Council, have also lost positions recently on UN bodies. The UN security council is made up of five permanent and 10 non-permanent members Many members on the General Assembly, which contains representatives from all UN countries, are said to have come to resent the way the Security Council has so much power, particularly the five permanent members. The so-called Group of 77 - which represent a coalition of mostly developing nations - has long been pushing for greater influence.

"Outsourced workers are are often low paid staff, such as caterers and security guards A group of 75 workers, including porters and receptionists, are going to tribunal to gain more rights at work. As outsourced employees, they are supplied to the University of London by a facilities company, but do not receive the same benefits as those employed directly. The university does not accept it should be a ""joint employer"", which would allow for better entitlements. The case could affect around 3.3 million outsourced workers in the UK. Many big organisations pay facilities companies to provide workers who are often low paid, such as cleaners or security guards. This allows them them to control the way people work, determining their pay and conditions, whilst avoiding many of the legal responsibilities of being an employer. Henry Chango Lopez is an outsourced worker at the heart of the campaign, which could become a game-changing legal challenge for millions of people around the country. He works as a porter at the university, but is employed by the business services company Cordant, and has two jobs to make ends meet. ""I start my day at 4am,"" he said. ""I travel from Hertfordshire to Southwark in London to do two hours' cleaning work. ""Then I go straight to my main job as a porter at the University of London, where I work from 8am to 3pm."" Mr Lopez wants the University of London to accept ""joint employer"" status Mr Lopez is part of the group, which also includes security guards and post-room staff, seeking a tribunal ruling that the university is recognised along with Cordant as their ""joint employer"". The concept has existed in various forms for decades in the US. It allows outsourced or franchise employees in some circumstances to legally compel client companies or franchisors to enter into collective bargaining agreements. However, it has to be shown that these companies have sufficient ""control"" over the employees. If established in the UK, unions could collectively bargain the pay, terms and conditions of outsourced workers with the ""joint employer"" - the employer that chooses to outsource. That employer may find it difficult to then justify inferior terms and conditions for its outsourced workers. The workers are being supported by the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain. Its general secretary, Dr Jason Moyer-Lee, said: ""For all intents and purposes, the outsourced workers at the University of London work for the university. ""It is the entity which essentially decides what their pay and terms and conditions are going to be. ""So, unless the workers can negotiate directly with the university, they can't really negotiate at all over their pay and terms and conditions."" UK law has never recognised the concept of ""joint employers"" for the purpose of negotiating workers' terms and conditions. Specialist employment lawyer Daphne Romney QC said that if it did, ""it would be enormous"". She added: ""There would be about 3.3 million outsourced employees whose terms and conditions would improve, because they would be on the same terms and conditions as the people they work alongside everyday but who are directly employed. ""And for the employers, of course, there would also be an impact because it would be more expensive to improve those terms and conditions."" Meanwhile, an employment lawyer with law firm CMS says if the case were to prevail it would ""almost make outsourcing pointless"". Sarah Ozanne said: ""Employees supplied to a client by an outsourced service provider, and able to claim parity with that client's own employees' terms and conditions, would undermine one of the key principles of outsourcing, which is to protect the client from employee liabilities."" Mr Lopez said his life would ""change massively"" if the principle was recognised, stopping him having to work two jobs and seeing a big improvement to his pension. But the university does not agree it is responsible. In a statement, the University of London told the BBC: ""The university does not employ any of these workers and does not accept that the relevant legislation recognises the concept of joint employment. ""We have therefore not agreed to the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain's request for recognition."" Does the EU protect workers' rights?

"This video can not be played Dr Mark Vanderpump told the BBC patients were seeing liothyronine sold for Â£5 in other European cities Drug company Concordia overcharged the NHS by millions for a key thyroid treatment, the Competition and Markets Authority has provisionally found. The CMA said that last year the NHS spent Â£34m,externalon its drug, liothyronine, up from about Â£600,000 in 2006. The amount the NHS paid per pack rose from around Â£4.46 in 2007 to Â£258.19 by July 2017, an increase of almost 6,000%. Concordia said,externalit did ""not believe that competition law has been infringed"". The price change occurred in the years after the drug was de-branded in 2007. The CMA said the price rise took place despite ""broadly stable"" production costs. Canadian drugs giant Concordia sells drugs to patients in more than 100 countries. Liothyronine tablets are primarily used to treat hypothyroidism, a condition caused by a deficiency of thyroid hormone affecting at least two in every 100 people and which can lead to depression, tiredness and weight gain. Until earlier this year, Concordia was the only supplier of the drug. CMA chief executive, Andrea Coscelli, said: ""Pharmaceutical companies which abuse their position and overcharge for drugs are forcing the NHS - and the UK taxpayer - to pay over the odds for important medical treatments. ""We allege that Concordia used its market dominance in the supply of liothyronine tablets to do exactly that."" Prescription medicines that are still under patent can be expensive, but the government caps profits from any that are sold to the NHS to keep costs low. But this system does not cover so-called ""generic medicines"", where a drug's patent has run out. The loophole means the price of older, established drugs coming off patent can rocket. A company, after filing and obtaining appropriate approval, can start trading the rebranded medicine and set a high price for it through a process known as ""debranding"". It's something the Competition and Markets Authority has challenged a number of drugs companies over. Mr Coscelli stressed that, at this stage in the investigation, the findings were provisional and there had been no definitive decision that there had been a breach of competition law. Concordia said the pricing of liothyronine had been conducted ""openly and transparently with the Department of Health in the UK over a period of 10 years"". ""Over that time, significant investment has been made in this medicine to ensure its continued availability for patients in the UK. ""We continue to work co-operatively with the CMA as it proceeds with its investigation."" It added that the CMA's statement included matters that pre-dated Concordia's ownership of its international segment, which it bought in 2015 from investment firm Cinven and other sellers, including Hg Capital. The CMA has also written to those two firms. Before she started taking liothyronine, Tara Riddle said her life was ""utter, utter exhaustion"". She told BBC 5 live: ""I had to lean on something, rather than stand, I couldn't go out, I couldn't shop. It was awful, absolutely awful."" Having researched her condition online she convinced her GP to prescribe her liothyronine which she took for four weeks. ""My life came back completely,"" she said. ""Then I called my GP and he said 'I am so, so glad, but I'm afraid I am not allowed to to give you any more because they are so expensive.'"" Tara is now forced to buy the drug overseas via the internet. She said: ""I get some from Greece, some from Mexico. I talked to my MP about it and he said they could be dirty drugs, and I said I know, but I said I wasn't going to go back to that bad place I was in. ""The NHS is paying around Â£900 for 100 tablets, and in Greece and Turkey they can be got for about Â£3. The NHS is paying way, way too much and there's something wrong."" An NHS England spokesperson said: ""This action sends an important enforcement signal to relevant generic drug manufacturers, and also wholesalers, that taxpayers and the NHS will not tolerate market abuses."" Dr Mark Vanderpump, former president of the British Thyroid Association, explained how he saw the cost of liothyronine rocket: ""Historically the drug cost the NHS about Â£20-30 a month. The new cost was over Â£300 a month. ""Patients were telling me they could go to a foreign capital and pay about Â£4-5 a month, so there was a massive difference in what the NHS was being charged versus what people were accessing it at at a European level."" If the provisional finding is upheld the CMA can impose a fine of up to 10% of Concordia's annual worldwide turnover. Earlier this year, Concordia was also accused of pushing up the price of a ""lifesaving"" NHS drug by striking a deal not to compete with another firm. The CMAsaid in provisional findings,externalthat Actavis and Concordia fixed the market for hydrocortisone tablets. Concordia also said then it did not think it was in breach of competition law. The CMA said the liothyronine case was one of a number it was looking at within the pharmaceutical sector. Previously, the watchdog has fined drugs giant Pfizer and Flynn Pharma nearly Â£90m in relation to what it called ""excessive and unfair prices"" for the anti-epilepsy treatment, phenytoin sodium capsules. It also fined a number of pharmaceutical companies a total of Â£45m in relation to anti-depressant medicine paroxetine. Both those decisions are under appeal. The CMA is pursuing another seven investigations into several companies in relation to drug pricing and competition issues.

"This video can not be played Benedict Allen said he made a video for his family in case he died whilst on expedition Explorer Benedict Allen encountered a tribal war, was caught in electrical storms and fell ill with malaria and dengue fever on an ill-fated jungle trek in Papua New Guinea, he has said. A search was mounted last week after Mr Allen missed planned flights. He was rescued by helicopter a few days later. Speaking to his friend, the BBC's Frank Gardner, Mr Allen, 57, said he was weak from malaria but was ""bouncing back"". His worst moment had been making a video will for his family, he said. Mr Allen, a father of three young children, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he never took satellite phones or GPS with him on expeditions, but might consider doing so in the future. His family's distress at his apparent disappearance appeared across newspapers, TV and radio, and prompted the Daily Mail, a British newspaper, to send a helicopter into the jungle to rescue him.

Now back in the UK, he said he was weak from malaria - the sixth time he has had it - and ""not that sharp mentally"". Mr Allen denied the search and rescue was a publicity stunt to raise his profile. ""I videoed all of this and you can see me deteriorating with malaria,"" he told Today. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Allen, who has filmed a number of his adventures for BBC documentaries, said he had not got lost, but events had seemed to conspire against him. ""I always knew exactly where I was, things just began to go wrong,"" he said. The trip had been hampered by a massive storm which swept away a vine bridge over a river. He had also started to feel the symptoms of malaria and his tablets had become sodden in the wet. The final straw, he said, was when he discovered there was a war going on ahead of him and he could not get out. ""I had to make my way to the nearest airstrip and try to get any local plane to come in,"" he said. He filmed an appeal on his video camera asking for a message to his children, aged 10, seven and two, and wife, Lenka, to be taken to the British High Commission if he died. Allow Twitter content?

Asked if this latest venture had been part of a mid-life crisis, Mr Allen said he saw himself as a professional - ""a risk calculator, not a risk taker"". ""On the very day the helicopter came, I had been gearing up to do a last walk out. ""I thought I was 80-85% likely to be successful, so I hadn't given up,"" he said, in an interview from west London. ""I wasn't expecting to be rescued. ""I never asked to be rescued but when it came - for the sake of my family - I thought 'I've got to do this'."" Mr Allen set out in October for Papua New Guinea to try to find the reclusive Yaifo tribe, who he first met 30 years ago. The rainforest was, he said, an ""extraordinary place that can work to pull you apart"" - the ""leeches, the constant rain, trees thumping down in the night, sleeping in a sort of swamp"". Among his travelling companions, natives of the rainforest, he knew he was the weakest and, after three weeks, knew he was ""falling apart"".

It's their home and gives them their food, shelter, medicine, so I had a resource."" He also defended himself against accusations he was ""an imperialist going in to see a lost tribe"".

"If you're 26 and annoyed about paying the full fare for your train travel, the Budget may offer a reprieve. The government has said people up to 30 years-old will now be able to buy a Â£30 railcard for discounted train travel. The move - set to be announced in Wednesday's Budget - would be an extension of the current young person's railcard for those aged 16 to 25. The so called millennials' card will be available from spring next year, and offer up to a third off non-peak fares. This means the new railcard is unlikely to be much use for regular commuters, as railcard discounts are restricted at peak times, usually before 10am. Reaction to the new card was mixed with some people saying it would have little impact on them and others welcoming the move. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Jimmy Connaughton, from St Albans Regular train user Jimmy Connaughton, 29, from St Albans said he was ""very excited"" about the new card which he reckons will save him up to Â£400 a year. ""It's been a long time since I lost the use of my 16-25 year rail card. I'm probably a bit more excited than I should be, but it is just before my 30th birthday,"" he said. The keen Chelsea fan mainly uses trains for travelling to and from football games. ""I go to a lot of matches and I have a multitude of railcards to try to replicate the Student Railcard. I have a Network Railcard [for trains across the south east], a Two Together, for when I travel with my Dad, and a Friends and Family [discounts for up to four adults and children] for other occasions."" He has no truck with those who think the railcard is a meagre gesture to the hard-pressed Millennial: ""True, you can't use it on peak trains but that ship sailed a while ago - anyone used to using student rail cards are used to not travelling on peak trains."" The card is part of a series of Budget measures aimed to attract younger voters after a resurgence in 18 to 29-year-olds voting in June's general election favoured the Labour party. The national roll-out of the card comes after a successful test of the discounted card in East Anglia. Railcards were introduced as a way for train companies to help fill seats during off-peak times. The card for 16 to 25-year-olds has existed in one form or another since 1974. On average, I am told, people who have a rail card at the moment (16 to 25-year-olds) save Â£150 a year. And anything that cuts costs for younger people has got to be a good thing. But there is one critical issue with this new scheme, you won't be able to use the card at peak times. So commuting to your job will be just as expensive... and it's about to get even more pricey. Season tickets go up by 3.6% in January. The highest rise since 2013. You might also like: Apology after train departs seconds early The degrees that make you rich... and the ones that don't Meet the world's youngest self-made billionaire The Treasury said the move would help keep the cost of living down for more young people. However, Andy McDonald, Labour's shadow transport secretary, said: ""Any move that reduces the cost of travel is welcome but the Tories are tinkering around the edges of a broken system. ""Our railway should be run by and for passengers, not private shareholders and foreign governments."" Also on Wednesday, the chancellor is expected to announce a review, led by an independent chair, into airline insolvency arrangements.

"Brook House holds up to 508 adult male asylum seekers, illegal immigrants and foreign national offenders Security firm G4S has commissioned an independent inquiry to review the ""attitude and behaviour"" of staff at an immigration removal centre it runs. Staff at Brook House were allegedly caught ""mocking, abusing and assaulting"" people being held there in covert footage filmed for BBC Panorama. G4S has a government contract to run the centre near Gatwick Airport. It has appointed an outside consultancy to conduct the inquiry but has not said whether the findings will be published. In September, Panorama aired footage recorded by ex-custody officer Callum Tulley at Brook House, which holds detainees who are facing deportation from the UK. Security firm G4S has since dismissed six members of staff at the centre and a number of other staff have also been disciplined. Brandon Lewis, the immigration minister, is expected to be questioned by MPs today about whether his department had concerns about the centre before the programme was broadcast. Immigration detainees 'mocked and abused' Inquiry call into immigration 'abuse' BBC News has now seen a letter from G4S to the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee which says the firm has commissioned an independent review to understand the ""extent and root causes of the treatment of detainees"" at Brook House. It has appointed investigators from consultancy organisation Verita, which carried out areview of practices at Yarl's Wood immigration centrein Bedfordshire. The investigation into Brook House will examine G4S's ""operational policies and management"", the treatment of detainees by staff, and the failings of whistleblowing procedures. BBC's home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said the inquiry is an indication of how seriously G4S regards the alleged abuse at Brook House. He added that the Home Office is still considering whether to renew the company's contract. Callum Tulley, 21, agreed to go undercover at Brook House The Equality and Human Rights Commission last month urged ministers to set up a public inquiry into wider issues with immigration centres- including allowing private firms to run them - but it says it has so far had no response from the Home Office. Home Secretary Amber Rudd, when asked about the Brook House programme at the home affairs committee last month, said she had been ""disgusted"" by the footage. ""It is completely unacceptable, and they have put together a plan of implementation to correct it,"" she told the committee. Brook House was branded ""fundamentally unsafe"" in 2010 - a year after opening. Three years later inspectors said they saw sustained improvement. The most recent report from HM Chief Inspector of Prisons, released in March this year, said some detainees had been held for excessive periods due to ""unreasonable delays in immigration decision making"".

"This video can not be played German chancellor Angela Merkel on Sunday said it was a day of ""deep reflection"" for Germany German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said she would prefer new elections to leading a minority government, after a breakdown in coalition talks plunged the country into political crisis. She also said she did not see any reason to resign from her post despite the failed negotiations. On Sunday evening, the FDP liberals pulled out of talks with Mrs Merkel's CDU/CSU bloc and the Greens. Germany's president called on parties to ""reconsider their attitudes"". Frank-Walter Steinmeier urged them to make compromises for Germany's ""well-being"", amid a situation he said was unprecedented. Mrs Merkel faces her biggest challenge in 12 years as chancellor. ""The path to the formation of a government is proving harder than any of us had wished for,"" she told broadcaster ARD. But she said she was ""very sceptical"" about a minority government, adding that ""new elections would be the better path"". In a separate interview with the ZDF broadcaster, she argued Germany needed stability and a government ""that does not need to seek a majority for every decision"". The elections were held in late September. What are the options now? Why German election was a turning point Long read: How Merkel rose to power Some in Mrs Merkel's party still hope for another grand coalition with the Social Democrats (SPD), despite that party repeatedly ruling such an option out. Earlier on Monday, SPD leader Martin Schulz said his party was ""not afraid of new elections"". When asked about the prospect of another alliance with the SPD, Mrs Merkel told ZDF she would wait to see what came of upcoming talks between President Steinmeier and SPD leaders. However, she said a demand for her to resign would not make a positive start for a new coalition. If fresh elections are to happen, they would need to be called by Mr Steinmeier, after a long drawn-out process that would take months. But he appears to view new polls as a last resort. In a brief address earlier on Monday he told politicians they had a responsibility that could not just be handed back to voters. ""Inside our country, but also outside, in particular in our European neighbourhood, there would be concern and a lack of understanding if politicians in the biggest and economically strongest country [in Europe] did not live up to their responsibilities,"" he said in a statement. Mrs Merkel's bloc won September's poll, but many voters deserted the mainstream parties. Negotiations between the pro-market FDP, the Greens and the conservative CDU/CSU bloc had gone on for four weeks before the FDP's surprise withdrawal late on Sunday. Mrs Merkel blamed the FDP for the collapse, saying that the parties were on the ""home straight"" when the liberals pulled out. But FDP leader Christian Lindner has defended his party, saying it ""did not take such a decision lightly"". Despite Mrs Merkel's words about a fresh poll, analysts say the new elections would be likely to benefit the anti-Islam, anti-immigrant AfD most, so other parties would probably try to avoid them. The far-right AfD won 12.6% of the vote in the September elections, entering parliament for the first time with more than 90 seats. Just how far to the right is AfD?

"Those undertaking fruit-picking jobs received the lowest pay, the study found One in three backpackers and a quarter of foreign students working in Australia are being paid about half the minimum wage or less, a study has said. The study, billed as the most comprehensive of its kind, found that wage theft of temporary migrants is endemic in Australia. Overall, conditions are worst for those employed in food services and on farms, and for workers from Asian countries. Authorities have urged foreign workers to report cases of exploitation. More than 4,300 workers from 107 countries were surveyed in the ""Wage Theft in Australia"" report, conducted by law professors at University of Technology, Sydney (UTS) and University of New South Wales (UNSW). It found a third of backpackers were paid A$12 (Â£6.80, $9) per hour or less, well below the legal minimum rate of A$22.13 for casual staff. On average, Asian workers received lower wages than people from English-speaking countries. Survey respondents also reported other violations that could amount to criminal forced labour, the authors said. Minister for Employment Michaelia Cash said the government had made ""several important reforms"" to address exploitation in the time since the survey began. Are backpackers worried about Australia? Taiwanese backpacker Amy Chang, 33, said she was not paid in her first month as a slicer at a meatworks in regional New South Wales. She said she was then paid A$16.86 per hour - less than the minimum wage and what Australian workers at the factory received. ""And you couldn't take sick leave or say no to working overtime, you were just worked like a machine,"" she said. Amy Chang said she found her job through a labour hire agency Ms Chang said employees knew they were being mistreated, but they were reluctant to speak out. ""Everyone was so scared of losing the job or their visa. Some of the workers joined the unions in the factories, but if you wanted to report the issue, the manager would target you."" The study authors said underpayment remained rampant across all industries, but some fared particularly badly. ""For almost 40% of students and backpackers, their lowest paid job was in a cafe, restaurant or takeaway,"" said co-author Prof Bassina Farbenblum, from UNSW. Those paid the worst were undertaking fruit-picking and farm jobs, where one in seven received as little as A$5 per hour, and almost a third earned A$10 per hour or less. The authors said some conditions could constitute forced labour: 91 workers reported having their passport confiscated by an employer 173 workers had to pay an upfront ""deposit"" to secure a job 112 workers were asked to pay cash back to their employers after receiving wages. Half of overseas workers reported either never or rarely ever receiving a pay slip, while almost half said they were paid in cash. This video can not be played Mia Ayliffe-Chung killing: Mum retraces backpacker's footsteps The report also found that a majority of workers knew they were being underpaid, but many did not expect to receive the legal minimum. This contradicted a popular assumption that foreign workers were unaware of the minimum wage, the authors said. The government urged workers with concerns to contact Australia's Fair Work Ombudsman. ""It is critical that all employers obey the law and pay the appropriate wage, regardless of the background or those employees,"" Ms Cash said in a statement. Since December last year, the government had given the ombudsman greater resources and passed legislation designed to assist vulnerable workers, Ms Cash said. The Fair Work Ombudsman urged temporary migrants, who make 11% of Australia's workforce, to look up their rights online.

"The allegations made against Charlie Rose span from the 1990s to 2011 US talk show host Charlie Rose has been suspended by several television networks following allegations of sexual harassment. Eight women accused the veteran TV interviewer of inappropriate behaviour,externalin a report by the Washington Post. ""These allegations are extremely disturbing and we take them very seriously,"" CBS News said. PBS and Bloomberg have also suspended him. Mr Rose has apologised, but said not all the allegations were accurate. They span from the 1990s to 2011 and include groping, lewd telephone calls and unwanted advances.

"Gen Constantino Chiwenga, 61, is being hailed as a political saviour after he led the military takeover in Zimbabwe, however he is under sanctions from the European Union and the US - for his role in a brutal crackdown on the opposition, and over the seizure of white-owned farms. Zimbabweans took to the streets on Saturday to demand President Robert Mugabe's resignation, holding aloft placards which declared: ""Zimbabwe army - the voice of the people."" Pastor Patrick Mugadza, hounded by the police in January this year for predicting that the 93-year-old leader would die in nine months' time, went as far as to announce that he intended to name his son after the general. ""My wife is very, very pregnant. When the boy comes, I will be naming him after you, General Chiwenga,"" Zimbabwe's privately owned NewsDay newspaperquoted him as saying in an audio message,external. Gen Chiwenga says he stepped in to end the economic suffering of Zimbabweans Yet, Gen Chiwenga played a central role in keeping Mr Mugabe in power after he lost elections to his main rival, Morgan Tsvangirai of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), in 2008, amid reports that Mr Mugabe was going to accept defeat. ""He told Mugabe: 'We can't lose elections. We can't hand power to the MDC. We are going to obliterate them,"" UK-based Africa confidential magazine editor Patrick Smith told the BBC, adding that he carried out the operation with Emmerson Mnangagwa, the man Gen Chiwenga is trying to install as Mr Mugabe's successor as president. ""They are joined at the hip, with Mnangagwa the senior partner,"" Mr Smith said. After a long delay, the official results were announced, saying that Mr Tsvangirai had not gained the 50% required for victory and so a second round was needed. Before the run-off, pro-Zanu-PF militias backed by the security forces attacked opposition supporters around the country, beating, raping and killing. Mr Tsvangirai pulled out of the second round and Mr Mugabe remained in power. This opposition supporter was one of thousands who said their homes were attacked by pro-Zanu-PF militias Gen Chiwenga joined the guerrilla war against white minority rule in the then Rhodesia as a teenager and got military training in Mozambique and Tanzania. After independence, he received British training, as a new army, made up of ex-guerrillas and soldiers of the former white minority regime, was formed. Power in Zimbabwe is monopolised by those who fought the 1970s war of independence Recalling his ex-student in an interview with the UK-basedSunday Times newspaper, retired Lt-Col Zach Freeth, 76, said Gen Chiwenga  was once caught cheating,external, and while he was deciding what to do with him the next morning, he received news that that the ex-guerrilla fighter, then in his 20s, had shot himself in the chest twice but had miraculously survived. Lt-Col Freeth said the incident was forgotten, but when Gen Chiwenga was appointed defence chief in 2003 he invited him to his home. ""He gave me his card and said: 'If you ever need anything...' We both knew what he was referring to."" Lt-Col Freeth was quoted as saying: ""I knew him very well. I probably did too good a job."" Many Zimbabweans are hoping that the army's intervention will lead to the downfall of Mr Mugabe A Zimbabwean lawyer, who has met Gen Chiwenga on several occasions, offered a different perspective of the army chief. ""He is fearless, and as tough as nails,"" the lawyer, who asked not to be identified, told the BBC. ""In terms of his political outlook, he is a Pan-Africanist at heart. He abhors the notion that Western values are superior. He believes in equal recognition, and that comes from the heart,"" the lawyer added. Now married to Mary Chiwenga - a former model and ex-wife of footballer Shingi Kazwondera - Gen Chiwenga was involved in a messy divorce about five years ago when he ended his marriage to his then-wife, Jocelyn. At the time, the privately owned NewZimbabwe.com news site reported that it had seen court papers in which Gen Chiwenga alleged that his wife used to beat him up, and even thrashed his office at military headquarters. She hit back, alleging that she was, in fact, the victim, and their marriage ran into trouble because he was having an affair with his current wife. President Mugabe's plan to anoint his wife, Grace, as his successor caused the crisis Gen Chiwenga's messy divorce enhanced, rather than damaged, his reputation among his troops. As one soldier told the BBC: ""The general is a very patient man. Look at how his relationship with Jocelyn was, but he waited for the right time to call it off."" His second wife obtained a degree from a university where Mr Mugabe is the chancellor just two days after the general took power. Mr Mugabe conferred degrees on more than 3,000 students, in his first public appearance since being put under house arrest. However, Mrs Chiwenga failed to attend. President Robert Mugabe was to have conferred a degree on the general's wife The veteran leader's appearance in public was intended to show that the general was treating him kindly. Said the soldier: ""Gen Chiwenga is a man of the people, a hard-working person who stands for the truth. He is an achiever.... No matter what is happening, the president will never win."" The army chief put Mr Mugabe under house arrest after the president had sacked the general's close ally Vice-President Mnangagwa, in a move seen as an attempt to install the Mr Mugabe's wife, Grace, as his successor. Days earlier, Gen Chiwenga had warned that ""the current purging, which is clearly targeting members of the party with a liberation background, must stop forthwith"". Gen Chiwenga then went to China, and Mr Mugabe's allies in the security forces planned to arrest him on his return, Mr Smith said. But the general got wind of the plot, and a strong contingent of  loyalist troops arrived at the airport, to prevent his detention. Shortly afterwards, the army chief took power, but insisted that he was not staging a coup. Zimbabwe's army says the worsening economic crisis threatens national security The army said it had intervened to arrest the ""criminals"" around Mr Mugabe, a reference to the political faction headed by Mrs Mugabe, and to end the economic suffering of Zimbabweans. His intervention caught Zimbabweans by surprise but, as the lawyer who has observed his career closely, said: ""Once you cross a certain path, he does not hesitate to act. However, he respects Mugabe and will want him to go out in the most dignified way possible. ""He is genuinely worried about the economic crisis and sees it as a threat to national security. So, he wants the politicians to start dealing with it, and he did not think the G40 faction [headed by Mrs Mugabe] would,"" said the lawyer. Gen Chiwenga flanked Mr Mugabe when he addressed the nation on Sunday night, vowing to remain in office despite the intense pressure on him to leave office. The army chief helped the president with his papers, as he struggled to read his long speech, and his officers saluted Mr Mugabe, still their commander-in-chief. ""It was theatre intended to show that the military are not bully boys picking on a nonagenarian. They want this to be sorted out as amicably as possible,"" Africa Confidential's Mr Smith said.

"General Chiwenga was welcomed to China by military leaders A trip to Beijing by Zimbabwe's military chief was a ""normal military exchange"", China's foreign ministry said after the army seized power in Harare. How deep are relations between China and Zimbabwe really? The news that General Constantino Chiwenga had visited China only a few days before the military takeover in Zimbabwe was a coincidence that did not go unnoticed. There was also speculation after China said it was closely watching developments, but stopped short of condemning President Mugabe's apparent removal from power. China is Zimbabwe's fourth largest trading partner and its largest source of investment - with stakes worth many billions of pounds in everything from agriculture to construction. Zimbabwe is the dependent partner - with China providing the largest market for its exports and much needed support to its fragile economy. China's relations with Zimbabwe are deep, starting during the Rhodesian Bush War. Robert Mugabe failed in 1979 to get Soviet backing, so turned to China, which provided his guerrilla fighters with weapons and training. Both countries formally established diplomatic relations atZimbabwean independence in 1980and Robert Mugabe visited Beijing as prime minister the following year. He has been a regular visitor since. Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe has met Chinese leaders a number of times For years, Zimbabwe's officials have tried to play off China against the West, advocating the country's ""Look East"" strategy, particularly following the introduction of EU sanctions in 2002. Indeed, a decade ago, Mr Mugabe told a packed rally at the Chinese-built national sports stadium in Harare: 'We have turned east, where the sun rises, and given our back to the west, where the sun sets."" China's military engagement also deepened during Zimbabwe's ""Look East"" era. Significant purchases were made, including Hongdu JL-8 jet aircraft, JF-17 Thunder fighter aircraft, vehicles, radar and weapons. However, following acontroversy about a shipment of arms in 2008,external, Beijing decided to list Zimbabwe for ""limited level"" military trading. Despite Zimbabwe's efforts, the ""Look East"" strategy did not bring the investment flood hoped for and a decade later, in August 2015, Mr Mugabe openly asked for Western re-engagement in his ""state of the nation"" address. Five things you should know about Zimbabwe Robert Mugabe - hero or villain? How can you tell a coup is happening? Now, the reality is that increasingly Chinese and Western interests - particularly those of the UK - have become aligned. Not far from each other in the outer suburbs of Harare, two of the biggest embassies in Zimbabwe are the British and the Chinese. As other embassies scaled down or closed, Beijing's expanded. Whereas British diplomats were well connected with business, civil society and opposition figures, the Chinese invested in ""technical support"" of the party of government Zanu-PF, including state security and the presidency. When it came to Zanu-PF politics and factionalism, Chinese diplomats were well connected and insightful and, like their Western colleagues, concerned about  stability, a better investment climate and adherence to the rule of law. President Xi Jinping visited Zimbabwe in 2015 and President Mugabe visited Beijing in January 2017. In public, the Chinese leader said his country is willing to encourage capable companies to invest in Zimbabwe. But in private, the message was that there would be no more loans until Zimbabwe stabilised its economy. Maj Gen Sibusiso Moyo said the military was not staging a coup In 2016 trade between the two countries amounted to $1.1bn (Â£0.8bn), with China the biggest buyer of Zimbabwean tobacco and also importing cotton and various minerals. In return Zimbabwe imported electronics, clothing and other finished products. Chinese state construction firms have also been active, building infrastructure including Zimbabwe's $100m (Â£75m) National Defence College. And last year China agreed to finance a new 650-seat parliament in Harare. But Chinese diplomats and many businesses are waiting for better days in Zimbabwe. Some companies have found the investment climate challenging - being burned on diamonds, for example - and have looked for alternative markets. A couple of weeks ago I was in China, attending a meeting on China-Africa relations and Zimbabwe was not mentioned once. Unlike Ethiopia, Sudan, or Angola that are strategic partners, or big markets like Nigeria, Kenya and South Africa, Zimbabwe is far from being Beijing's new priority. So, Beijing's interest is in a better investment climate in Zimbabwe. A clear transitional arrangement resulting in elections for a legitimate government in Harare is as much in Beijing's interest as London's. The ""Look East"" and the ""Re-engagement with the West"" strategies have not brought about the confidence and investment that Zimbabwe needs. What Zimbabwe requires is stable and accountable government - then investors from Asia, America and Europe will seriously consider that Zimbabwe has an investment future. This was the message that Mr Mugabe received in Beijing in January. And the one which Zimbabwe's military chief also was given last week.

"ICJ judges sitting in the Hague in December 2015 The UK is to lose its seat on the International Court of Justice for the first time since the United Nations' principal legal body began in 1946. Sir Christopher Greenwood was hoping to be elected for a second nine-year term on the bench of 15 judges in the Hague. The government withdrew his candidacy after six rounds of votes with India's Dalveer Bhandari ended in a deadlock. Sir Christopher was backed by theUN Security Councilbut his rival was chosen by the General Assembly. A successful candidate needs to gain a majority of support in both bodies. The UK's move means Mr Bhandari will be able take up a position on theICJ,external, alongside four other judges already elected. The UK government had considered invoking a little-known arbitration process but in the end chose to take Sir Christopher out of the race. The British ambassador to the UN, Matthew Rycroft, said he was ""naturally disappointed"". Mr Rycroft said: ""The UK has concluded that it is wrong to continue to take up the valuable time of the Security Council and the UN General Assembly with further rounds of elections.... ""If the UK could not win in this run-off, then we are pleased that it is a close friend like India that has done so instead. We will continue to cooperate closely with India, here in the UN and globally."" He said the UK would continue to support the work of the ICJ ""in line with our commitment to the importance of the rule of law in the UN system and in the international community more generally"". Downing Street refused to confirm that UK Prime Minister Theresa May was involved in lobbying for Sir Christopher to get the job, saying only that representations were made at the highest levels of government. By James Landale, BBC diplomatic correspondent However hard the government tries, this defeat at the UN will be seen as a significant diplomatic set back, a symbol of Britain's reduced status on the world stage. Britain tried to win an election but the community of nations backed the other side, no longer fearing any retribution from the traditional powers, no longer listening to what Britain had to say. Some will blame this on Brexit - that might be a little simplistic. Few countries are as obsessed with Brexit as the UK. But what is clear is that many countries at the UN were willing to defy Britain and that would have been less likely a few years ago. The government likes to talk of what it calls ""global Britain"", a vision of a buccaneering UK, independent of the EU, promoting its interests and values and trade around the world. The problem is that many believe that vision has not yet been backed up with any policy substance. Instead, rightly or wrongly, many countries see the UK turning in on itself to sort out the complexity of Brexit. They see it as a retreat from the international stage - whatever the Brexiteers argue to the contrary - and these countries are filling the vacuum accordingly. How UK lost International Court of Justice place to India France and Russia, which along with the UK, US and China make up the permanent members of the UN Security Council, have also lost positions recently on UN bodies. The UN security council is made up of five permanent and 10 non-permanent members Many members on the General Assembly, which contains representatives from all UN countries, are said to have come to resent the way the Security Council has so much power, particularly the five permanent members. The so-called Group of 77 - which represent a coalition of mostly developing nations - has long been pushing for greater influence.

"The vessel is the newest of the three submarines in the Argentine navy's fleet Argentina's navy says its ARA San Juan submarine, which has been missing since Wednesday, reported a mechanical breakdown in its last communication. The submarine, with 44 crew on board, disappeared 430km (270 miles) off the Argentine coast. ""The vessel surfaced and it reported a breakdown,"" naval commander Gabriel Galeazzi said. Argentina's navy said a ""noise"" picked up by sonar on Monday during the search did not come from the vessel. It is the second false alarm in the hunt for the submarine. Capt Galeazzi, who heads the naval base in Mar del Plata, south of Buenos Aires, said that the fault reported earlier related to a ""short circuit"" in the sub's batteries. What happens when a sub vanishes The brother of a crew member earlier told local media that in a message before communications were lost his sibling had mentioned that the vessel was having problems with its batteries. This is the first time that an official has mentioned the sub encountering mechanical problems. However Capt Galeazzi said that mechanical problems were not uncommon and rarely posed a risk. ""A warship has a lot of backup systems, to allow it to move from one to another when there is a breakdown,"" he said. The naval commander said that the submarine had been asked to cut short its mission, which was originally due to last until Monday, and go directly to Mar del Plata. According to local media, the captain of the ARA San Juan contacted the naval base again after reporting the mechanical problem. In the message, he reportedly said the sub was heading towards Mar del Plata with all 44 crew members in perfect health. The navy also announced on Monday that seven signals picked up at the weekend were not from the missing submarine's satellite phone. The failed calls, lasting between four and 36 seconds, had been received on Saturday. They had raised hopes that the crew members were alive. A huge search and rescue operation is continuing in the South Atlantic. Specialist underwater rescue equipment has arrived in Argentina from the United States and more boats and planes have also joined the search, which has been hampered by heavy winds and high waves. The ARA San Juan was returning from a routine mission to Ushuaia, near the southern-most tip of South America, towards Mar del Plata.

"When the only interaction is with a machine, shopping can be a ""miserable experience"" Automated checkout machines put off about a quarter of older people from going shopping, a survey from a housing charity for the elderly suggests. They can find the automated checkouts ""intimidating"" and ""unfriendly,"" according to the charity, Anchor. Without someone to talk to at the tills, shopping can be a ""miserable experience,"" a spokesman said. The British Retail Consortium said it was important for shops to be welcome destinations for all of the community. The lack of seats in shopping centres or on High Streets can also make older people feel ""shut out"", according to the charity. It also warned that automated checkouts could add to loneliness and isolation among the elderly. ""There was a time when people knew their shopkeepers and could pass the time of day. You can't do that with a machine,"" says Mario Ambrosi, a spokesman for the charity. The report from the charity, produced by the Centre for Future Studies consultancy group, says there is a ""dire need for the High Street to re-invent itself"" if it is going to be accessible and attractive to older people. The study suggests 24% of older people are deterred from shopping by automated checkouts and 60% are worried that there will be a lack of seating if they need to rest. The report says older people can feel ""shut out"" from shopping With rising numbers of older people, the charity says that by the end of the next decade retailers could be missing out on Â£4.5bn per year if pensioners stay away from the shops. ""The technology needs to have some human interaction, it's what gets people into the shops,"" says Mr Ambrosi. He says there are still ""significant numbers"" of older people who are not online and depend on going to the shops - but who find the experience uncomfortable. For the automated checkouts, he says people might feel under pressure ""if they don't respond quickly enough"" to the instructions. It also might mean ""they can have gone shopping without having said 'hello' to a single person - and that's quite a miserable experience,"" he says. Daphne Guthrie, who is approaching her 93rd birthday, says across her lifetime she has seen a complete change in shopping culture - from small, privately owned stores, where shopkeepers knew their customers, to impersonal megastores. ""I wouldn't want everything to be automated,"" says Daphne Guthrie. Mrs Guthrie, from Market Deeping, in Lincolnshire, says she would always choose a till with a human and has never tried the automatic checkouts. She would like shops to be more welcoming to older customers and shopping centres to be less harsh environments for people who might want to stop and chat, particularly those who might not get to talk to many people. ""They should be more friendly - treat me as a person and not just someone who pays the bill. ""I wouldn't want everything to be automated,"" she says, The Campaign to End Loneliness has warned of an estimated 1.2 million people in the UK who have ""chronic"" loneliness. The campaign has highlighted thatautomated checkouts have shut down what might be some people's only chance to talk to someone during the day. Anchor is also promoting the Standing Up 4 Sitting Down campaign to improve seating in shops and the High Street. A spokeswoman for the British Retail Consortium said shops had been trying to incorporate more seating to ""ensure everyone can have an enjoyable shopping experience"". ""As high streets continue to evolve, it's increasingly important they are welcome destinations for people of all parts of the community."" But the increase in automation and self-checkout machines is about costs, the retailers' group said, reflecting the ""diverging costs of labour versus technology"". Caroline Abrahams of Age UK said: ""Clearly there is no single 'older consumer' - people in later life are incredibly diverse in terms of their interests, income and health. ""That's why it's vital that shops and companies do not stereotype  their older customers, whilst also being aware of the ways in which some might need a bit of practical support."" Martin Tett, the Local Government Association's environment spokesman, said councils understood how ""crucial it is that all members of our communities can play a role in our civic life, and that includes making sure our high streets are as accessible as possible"". He said that councils could support partnerships to ""support dementia-friendly communities or age-friendly cities"".

"There are about 700 breeding pairs of wandering albatrosses on Bird Island The spectacular wandering albatrosses in Sunday'sBlue Planetprogramme on the BBC have suffered a major decline in numbers over the past three decades. New research suggests breeding pairs of this species are now little more than half what they were in the 1980s. Scientists say the losses are the result of careless fishing practices and climate pressures. The researchers are affiliated to the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), which organised the filming for the TV show. BAS has been running a long-term tagging and monitoring study on Bird Island, a 4km-long stretch of land on the western fringes of South Georgia in the South Atlantic. The animals' global population is spread across only a handful of sub-Antarctic territories. The wandering albatrosses are not the only species, though, to experience a slump. Black-browed and grey-headed albatrosses have followed a similar trend. ""These populations have all declined over the period we've been monitoring them,"" said BAS expert Richard Phillips. ""There have been different phases, so for the wandering albatrosses there was a gradual decline and then it got really steep before things slowed up. Some of the variability is down to a changing environment; some of it is down to fishing effort."" Albatrosses counted from space Map traces Shackleton's footsteps South Georgia's giant ice history Fur seals feel climate impacts Albatrosses will often try to take the bait on longline fishing gear. They get snagged on the hooks, are pulled under the water and are drowned. In the immediate vicinity of South Georgia, toothfish trawlers have modified the way they put their lines out to limit this collateral damage, but the birds forage over thousands of square km and will often encounter vessels that still do not use the most sensitive fishing methods. And sometimes, shifts in climate can drive the birds towards this danger, says Dr Deborah Pardo, the lead author on the new research. ""We also found the grey-headed albatross population was particularly affected by the climatic event of El NiÃ±o, which coincided with increased fishing activity in their foraging areas. ""El NiÃ±o reduced the amount of food available so the birds probably switched to feeding on discards behind fishing vessels, increasing the number being hooked on longlines."" Not all climate effects are negative. The recent increasing trend towards stronger poleward winds actually benefits the wandering albatrosses. ""Such winds make their flight more efficient,"" Dr Phillips told BBC News. ""They can fly faster. Essentially, these winds make the cost of travel cheaper for them."" Sunday's programmeconsidered the breeding outcomes for elderly pairs of wandering albatrosses. Separate BAS research has established that the very last chicks these senior albatrosses produce will often succeed and flourish. Dr Phillips explained: ""There's a theoretical prediction that if a bird is about to die then it might put more effort into rearing the last chick, or the alternative is the very fact that it has reared that chick has a cost - there's a cost of reproduction - and subsequently the bird won't recover and it will die for that reason."" Currently on Bird Island there are roughly 700 pairs of wandering albatrosses, 3,000 pairs of grey-headed albatrosses and 7,000 pairs of black-browed albatrosses.

"President Mugabe is under pressure from the public and his own Zanu-PF party Zimbabwe's former vice-president, whose sacking led to last week's army takeover, has urged President Robert Mugabe to resign immediately. Emmerson Mnangagwa said he fled abroad two weeks ago when he learned of a plot to kill him, and he would not return until he was sure of his security. Parliament has now begun a session in which the ruling Zanu-PF party is to start impeaching the president. Mr Mugabe is accused of allowing his wife to ""usurp constitutional power"". Speaking from an undisclosed location on Tuesday, Mr Mnangagwa said the 93-year-old president should heed the ""clarion call"" of his people and step down. ""I told the President that I would not return home now until I am satisfied of my personal security, because of the manner and treatment given to me upon being fired,"" he said in a statement. In a bid to resolve the crisis, South African President Jacob Zuma and his Angolan counterpart JoÃ£o LourenÃ§o will travel to Zimbabwe on Wednesday on behalf of southern Africa's regional body, Sadc, the grouping said. Zimbabwe at crossroads - full coverage: Impeachment: Latest updates Mugabe's dwindling options Emmerson Mnangagwa, ""crocodile"" and heir apparent Robert Mugabe - hero or villain? Many in Zanu-PF want Emmerson Mnangagwa to be the next president Analysis by Andrew Harding, BBC News, Harare Emmerson Mnangagwa more or less accused President Mugabe of trying to have him killed. The statement from the former vice-president gave an extraordinary insight into the vicious power struggles that preceded last week's military intervention here. Mr Mnangagwa said his security guards had warned him of plans to ""eliminate"" him, after he was sacked earlier this month. He promptly fled to South Africa. On Monday night, Zimbabwe's army generals claimed that Mr Mnangagwa had agreed to return home as part of a transitional roadmap. That roadmap now sounds like wishful thinking, as parliament here prepares to impeach the president, and Mr Mnangagwa angrily demands that his former boss respects the will of the people or face humiliation. This video can not be played Zimbabwe reacts: ""We need him to resign... our lives are terrible right now"" The president has been in power since independence in 1980. He has won elections, but over the past 15 years these have been marred by violence against political opponents. Above all, Mr Mugabe has presided over a deepening economic crisis. Zimbabweans are on average 15% poorer now than they were in 1980. What triggered moves to oust him was Mr Mnangagwa's dismissal as vice-president two weeks ago. The move was seen by many as clearing the way for Mr Mugabe's wife Grace to succeed her husband as leader. The move riled top soldiers, who stepped in and put Mr Mugabe under house arrest. However he remains president, and in recent days has defied calls from his own party and from protesters to stand down. In a further sign of his dwindling authority, only a handful of his ministers turned up for a cabinet meeting on Tuesday. This video can not be played ""Government for his relatives is not the government for us,"" say locals in President Mugabe's home town Zimbabwe's constitution lists ""serious misconduct"", ""violation"" of the constitution or ""failure to obey, uphold or defend"" it, or ""incapacity"", as grounds for impeachment. On Monday, Zanu-PF member of parliament Paul Mangwana said: ""The main charge is that he has allowed his wife to usurp constitutional power when she has no right to run government. ""He has refused to implement the constitution of Zimbabwe - particularly we had elections for the provincial councils, but up to now they have not been put into office."" This video can not be played Zimbabwe's week of upheaval in two minutes It would start with a motion, to be presented as early as Tuesday afternoon, laying out the charges against Mr Mugabe and his wife. If - as is likely - the motion is approved by a 50% majority in a joint sitting of the National Assembly and the Senate, a committee from both chambers will be appointed to investigate. Should the committee support the charges, the president can then be removed if both houses back them with two-thirds majorities. Paul Mangwana said the process could be fast-tracked and completed by Wednesday, ""because the charges are so clear"".  But others insist the process should take longer. Tendai Biti, a leader of the opposition MDC, insists the constitution allows for a fair hearing. ""Mugabe as the accused person will obviously be entitled to legal representation,"" Mr Biti told the BBC. The full process, he added, could take between one and three weeks. If the impeachment is fast-tracked, he said, ""the process will not be legitimate or credible"". He will be succeeded by the vice-president. The military would like to see Mr Mnangagwa step into that role. But it is current Vice-President Phelekezela Mphoko, a supporter of Grace Mugabe, who would in theory assume the post. It is not clear if Mr Mnangagwa could be restored to his former position. Why China matters to Zimbabwe's leaders Robert Mugabe - hero or villain?
