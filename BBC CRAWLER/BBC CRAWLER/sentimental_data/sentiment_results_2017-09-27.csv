"Ryanair has been threatened with legal action for ""persistently misleading"" passengers about their rights following thousands of flight cancellations. The Civil Aviation Authority,external(CAA)'s chief executive Andrew Haines said he was ""furious"" that the airline was not complying with the law. The authority has launched ""enforcement action"" against Ryanair for wrongly claiming it did not have to re-route passengers on rival airlines. Ryanair now says it will co-operate. In a brief statement, the airline said: ""We already comply fully with all EU261 legislation, are meeting with the CAA and will comply fully with whatever requirements they ask us to."" The action comes afterRyanair cancelled a further 18,000 flights. Ryanair: The 34 routes being suspended Ryanair cancellations: What are my rights? The CAA's Mr Haines told the BBC that he very much doubted the dispute would get as far as the courts, but added it was ""unacceptable"" that Ryanair was disregarding the law and customers' rights. ""These are simple things to fix and they're choosing not to fix them,"" he said. ""People shouldn't have to choose between low fares and legal rights."" Mr Haines singled out Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary for particular criticism, telling Radio 5live: ""Michael himself said he wasn't going to pay for passengers to fly on other airlines. That's against the law. ""My concern with Ryanair, and the reason we are speaking so openly, is they say one thing and yet they don't follow it through."" The fresh round of flight cancellations will be between November and March and affect the travel plans of a further 400,000 customers. A total of 34 routes will be suspended this winter, including Stansted to Edinburgh and Glasgow, Gatwick to Belfast and Newcastle to Faro. Earlier this month, the airline cancelled up to 50 flights a day through to the end of October, also affecting 400,000 passengers. The regulator said that on both occasions Ryanair had failed to provide customers with ""necessary and accurate"" information about their rights. Ryanair has about 24 hours after telling affected passengers of a cancellation to book them on an alternative Ryanair flight If the alternative Ryanair flight is not soon enough, or at a time that does not work for you, then you can tell Ryanair to book you on the most appropriate flight on an alternative airline at no extra cost to you Consumer group Which? says that it is best to make Ryanair do the legwork - rather than take a refund from the Ryanair flight, rebook yourself on another airline, and try to reclaim any extra cost from Ryanair if the new flight is more expensive. By doing so, you will probably only get a refund for the cancelled Ryanair flight, but not the difference for the more expensive alternative flight As more than two weeks' notice has been given for the new wave of flights cancellations, affected passengers will not be entitled to the extra compensation that is paid under EU rules for last-minute cancellations The CAA said information provided on Ryanair's website failed to make it clear that the airline was obliged to refund all expenses incurred as a result of the flight cancellation. Those expenses included meals, hotels, as well as transfer costs to re-route passengers on other airlines when there was no suitable alternative, the CAA said. The airline has said that passengers affected by the move will be offered alternative flights or full refunds and had been emailed about advising them of flight changes occurring until the end of October. They will also be offered vouchers of 40 euros (Â£35) one way, or 80 euros return, towards alternative flights on top of any refund. Ryanair has blamed the series of flight cancellations on ""messing up"" pilot holiday rosters. This is the regulator firing a shot across the bows of Ryanair. It doesn't feel that the airline is doing enough to tell people about their rights under EU law if their flight has been cancelled. They could be entitled to money and a flight back with another airline if Ryanair can't help them get home in reasonable time. The CAA will take views for the next seven days before deciding whether to press ahead with action. It could end up in court, with Ryanair facing a fine, but what normally happens is the airline makes some changes and the CAA backs off. Ryanair cancellations: What are my rights?

"This video can not be played Meet the outsider who made Trump eat his words US President Donald Trump has deleted several tweets endorsing a candidate he backed in an Alabama election after he crashed to defeat on Tuesday. ""Luther Strange has been shooting up in the Alabama polls since my endorsement,"" Mr Trump wrote in one now-removed post. He campaigned for Mr Strange, but could not save him from defeat by ultraconservative firebrand Roy Moore. The underdog's victory has sent shockwaves through Washington. Things Republican Roy Moore believes In one now-deleted Tweet, the president said Mr Strange ""will never let you down!"" according to news websiteProPublica,external, which documents Mr Trump's posts. In another, the president said ""vote today for 'Big Luther'"". Analysis:By Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter Alabama Senator Luther Strange is disappearing down the memory hole. As in George Orwell's 1984, where politically inconvenient information is scrubbed from the records, Donald Trump is airbrushing over past support for the soon-to-be-former senator. It's just part of the president's efforts to mend fences with his Make America Great Again base and their more impassioned advocates. Getting back in favour with Mr Moore's supporters shouldn't be too hard for Mr Trump, given there were few who seemed to believe his heart was in the Strange endorsement. They thought the president was mistaken or being misled, and he would eventually come around. It didn't take long. If there's a lesson the president will take from all this, it may be that he shouldn't try too hard to push his supporters in a direction they don't want to go. And if you're a Washington politician seeking re-election next year, it's best to assume you're going to be on your own. Early on Wednesday, Mr Trump changed his tune to congratulate Mr Moore on his victory. ""Sounds like a really great guy who ran a fantastic race. He will help to #MAGA!"" he tweeted, referring to his ""Make America Great Again"" catchphrase. The Republican president has been known previously to occasionally delete tweets, most often replacing them after correcting spelling errors or other mistakes. Some watchdog groups have criticised the deletions, saying that the tweets are government records that must be preserved for the historical record. Mr Moore rode a wave of support in the Republican primary from the same grassroots conservative movement that helped elect Mr Trump. Allow Twitter content?

A political fund closely linked to Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell spent nearly $9m on Mr Strange's campaign. But Mr Moore derided his opponent as an ""establishment lackey"". With all 67 counties reporting, the outspoken evangelical Christian led the incumbent by 55% to 45%. Mr Trump and Vice-President Mike Pence both appeared with Mr Strange at rallies in Alabama.

The president had tweeted support for him at least 10 times. During a campaign appearance for Mr Strange last week, Mr Trump told the crowd ""I might have made a mistake"" in endorsing the former Alabama attorney general. Mr Strange was appointed to the Alabama Senate seat after Jeff Sessions joined the Trump administration as attorney general. Mr Moore said of the vote: ""God has put me in this election at this time, and all the nation is watching"" A White House aidetold CNN,externalon Wednesday that the president felt ""embarrassed"" by Mr Strange's loss. Political websiteAxios,externalreports that Mr Trump blames Mr McConnell and ""has taken to physically mocking"" him. Mr Moore, 70, is best known for twice losing his position on the Alabama Supreme Court. He was de-benched the first time for refusing to remove a Ten Commandments monument from the courthouse and again for refusing to issue same-sex marriage licences. Mr Moore is now the heavy favourite for Alabama's special election in December against a Democrat. Alabama has not elected a Democrat to the Senate in a quarter of a century.

"This video can not be played Video from scene of Portbury Hundred incident A man has died in a shooting involving armed police at a junction of the M5 motorway near Bristol. Officers fired shots at a car on the Portbury Hundred (A369) near junction 19 for Portishead at about 09:30 BST, an eyewitness told the BBC. Avon and Somerset Police said it acted following reports of a man in a car with a handgun. The Independent Police Complaints Commission said there were reports ""he had threatened another motorist"". Latest updates from the scene Bullet holes can be seen in the rear window of the red car Forensic teams are carrying out fingertip searches of the scene A police spokesman said: ""Earlier this morning we received calls from concerned members of the public travelling on the M5 who reported they had seen a man in a car with a handgun. ""The vehicle left the motorway at junction 19 and officers stopped the car on the A369 known as the Portbury Hundred. ""Shots were subsequently fired in an incident involving police firearms and a man has died. ""We referred the incident to the IPCC: they're now on the scene carrying out an independent investigation which we are supporting."" The road will remain closed overnight whilst investigations continue. The force added it was not terror-related. An IPCC spokesman confirmed it had launched an investigation and said its teams have been at the scene gathering evidence. ""We have been advised that officers were responding to reports of a man travelling on the M5 with a handgun and that he had threatened another motorist,"" he said. ""What appears to be a non-police issue firearm was found at the scene and will also be subject to examination."" He added inquiries were continuing to formally identify the deceased and his next of kin. A post mortem is due to take place on Thursday. IPCC Commissioner Cindy Butts: ""At this stage we are currently investigating the circumstances of the incident and no individual police officer is under investigation. ""There would have been a large number of witnesses, given this incident took place on a busy road during rush hour. We would ask that anyone with information that may assist our independent investigation make contact with our investigators."" This video can not be played What appears to be a handgun can be seen on top of the damaged car Forensic officers in white protective suits are scouring every inch of the car and road surface. An object on the roof of the red car looks like a handgun to the naked eye. There are bullet holes in the windows and shards of shattered glass on the tarmac below. The driver's door is open. This afternoon police erected a large privacy barrier across the end of the road and extended the cordon around the scene. A large blue police tent has been carried in and installed next to the car. David Ellison told BBC Radio Bristol he saw officers fire between six and 10 shots through the passenger window using handguns. ""They surrounded it. They shot maybe five, six or 10 times,"" he said. ""Then they dragged a man from the car to resuscitate him. ""It came off the roundabout towards Portishead and then was boxed in by cars."" Lisa Fussell told the BBC she had been driving along the Portbury Hundred when she came across a scene of ""chaos"" involving two unmarked police cars and ""five or six officers dressed all in black"". ""The air ambulance landed in front of us. The medics got out and ran to a red car. It looked like someone had been taken ill,"" she said. ""It frightened us and it's upsetting now that we know he's been killed. He was someone's son."" The Great Western Air Ambulance's critical care team also attended. The Portbury Hundred links the M5 motorway to the town of Portishead, to the west of Bristol. Diversions are in place and police have advised drivers to plan ahead and use alternative routes.

"Theresa May defended capitalism as the main driver of greater wealth and higher living standards Theresa May has defended free market capitalism in a speech marking 20 years since the Bank of England was given the right to set interest rates. She said Britons should never forget the value of a free market economy. The prime minister also restated her determination to retain a ""balanced approach"" to public spending despite political pressure to ease austerity. ""Continuing to deal with our debts,"" is the way to strengthen the economy, she said. Her comments follow Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's speech on Wednesday at his party's conference, in which he said capitalism was facing a ""crisis of legitimacy"". Mr Corbyn - who has consistently criticised the Conservative party's austerity programme - also insisted Labour's policies were ""what most people in our country actually want"". However, the prime minister said her government would not change course. ""To abandon that balanced approach with unfunded borrowing and significantly higher levels of taxation would damage our economy, threaten jobs, and hurt working people,"" she said. Capitalism: Corbyn v May Corbyn: We're the mainstream now Mrs May argued that Britain's flexible labour market had brought prosperity, and when countries adopted free market economics ""life expectancy increases and absolute poverty falls"", she said. It was the ""only sustainable means of raising the living standards of everyone in a country"", she added. But, she acknowledged, the government needed ""to be honest about where it is not currently working"". The Bank of England was given the independence to decide interest rates on its own on 6 May 1997 by then Chancellor Gordon Brown, just days after the new Labour government took office. Prior to that, interest rate decisions were taken by the chancellor, taking into account advice from the Bank as well as Treasury officials. That meant changes were often driven by political considerations, for example lowering interest rates after a Budget to boost the economy, or raising them immediately after a general election. Mrs May said that giving the Bank the power to decide interest rates had been crucial to keeping inflation low in the past two decades. For his part, the current Bank Governor Mark Carney restated that the Bank would be vigilant to counter any economic or financial disruption from the Brexit process. ""Banks will be capitalised so that they can withstand any severe shock that could be associated with Brexit - however unlikely - and still meet demand for credit,"" he said.

"The policy at Shirley Manor Primary Academy will see parents contacted if banned items are found in lunchboxes A school ban on sausage rolls and other ""unhealthy"" foods in pupils' lunchboxes has divided opinion. The new policy at Shirley Manor Primary Academy in Bradford states parents will be called if banned foods are found in packed lunches. Steve Fryer, whose son's sausage roll was confiscated, said the school should ""stick to teaching kids"". Others have praised the school for healthy eating,according to comments on the Bradford Telegraph and Argus,external. The policy,externalsays pupils are encouraged to show their packed lunches to staff before and after they have eaten. More news from across Yorkshire It states pork pies, sausage rolls and pepperoni sticks should not be included and neither should fruit squash or flavoured water. It says this is because they are high in salt and saturated fat and the school is keen to promote a balanced diet. The school introduced the new policy at the start of the September term Mr Fryer said his son's sausage roll was removed last Monday and given back to him at the end of the day. ""He was given a ham sandwich instead but he hates ham so there's no way he was going to eat it. ""He ended up eating a dry crisp sandwich. How is that any healthier?"" He added: ""It's my job as a parent to decide what my child eats, not the school's. ""The school won't even compromise and allow us to send sausage rolls once or twice a week. I'm furious."" Head teacher Heather Lacey said the vast majority of parents supported the ban and there had been a big increase in the number of children bringing in healthy lunches.

"Dan Dugdale contacted Sainsbury's after spending a ""stressed evening at the vet's"" with Suzie Pet owners have complained to Sainsbury's after their dogs have fallen ill from eating promotional chocolate sent through the post. The supermarket chain has posted free Green & Black's chocolate bars to its reward card holders in recent days. Vets have warned that dogs only need to consume a very small amount of chocolate to find themselves in an ""emergency situation"". Sainsbury's says it is investigating complaints ""as a matter of urgency"". Sarah Hayward's cocker spaniel Jarvis was rushed to the vet after he tore into the promotional box while she was at work. Dog eats couple's wedding cake on big day Dog eats rugby player's passport ahead of tour Dog back on track after toy train surgery She toldBBC Radio 5 Live: ""My parents, who came home to let the dogs out at lunchtime, found the empty packet on his bed - and obviously they were trying to work out what it was initially. ""They realised it was chocolate and the second they called the vet they were told to rush him straight in. ""He was put on various drips to flush fluids down him to try and induce him to be sick and, yes, it was a bit of a worry"". Sainsbury's has apologised to owners of the dogs affected, which include Jarvis Meanwhile, Sammy Taylor, from Kent, wrote on Facebook that she was ""furious"" with the supermarket chain. She said her puppy's stomach was pumped after it ate the chocolate. Dan Dugdale, from York, said he contacted Sainsbury's after spending a ""stressed evening at the vet's"" with his dog. He said that the actual reward card-holder did not live at his address. A Sainsbury's spokesperson said the company was ""extremely sorry for the distress caused"". ""We know chocolate is unsafe for pets to eat and that's why we had measures in place to safeguard against pet owners receiving this promotion,"" they added. Green & Black's declined to comment. Dr Huw Stacey, Director of Clinical Services at Vets4Pets, explained that chocolate can be toxic for dogs - especially dark chocolate as it contains higher levels of chocolate solids. Chocolate contains theobromine, a naturally occurring chemical found in cocoa beans. It is fine for humans to eat, but dogs cannot metabolise it. He told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""It only takes a very small amount of dark chocolate to pose a big threat for dogs. ""The important thing is that the sooner you can do something about it, the better. If they've just eaten it you can give them drugs to make them vomit it back up again and get it out of their system"". According to the British Veterinary Association (BVA), chocolate can be poisonous for any animal but dogs are the most commonly affected pets: They usually show signs of poisoning within 12 hours but symptoms can last for up to three days. Symptoms include excessive thirst, vomiting, diarrhoea and restlessness. They can develop into hyperactivity, tremors, abnormal heart rate, hyperthermia and rapid breathing. In the worst cases, dogs can experience fits and in some cases can fall into a coma or die. Owners who know their dogs have consumed chocolate are advised to call their vets ""even if they look well in themselves"", as the symptoms may not show up in the first hour or so, Dr Stacey said.

"Police have arrested a paedophile who went missing on the same day he was convicted of 16 offences. David Hart, from Morriston, Swansea, failed to show up at the city's crown court for the last day of his trial on Tuesday. Hart, a 60-year-old taxi driver, was arrested by South Wales Police at an address in Morriston on Wednesday. His victim was just 11 or 12 when he began a campaign of abuse, which lasted for 14 years. Officers said the hunt for Hart was ""immediately treated as a top priority"". Hart was convicted of 12 charges of rape, two of indecent assault, one of assault by penetration and one of assault occasioning actual bodily harm on Tuesday. 'Life-changing consequences' Judge Geraint Walters said his victim had described ""some of the gravest sexual offences"". He adjourned sentencing, saying Hart faced ""many years"" in prison. During the trial, the court heard some of the abuse was carried out in front of a camera with hundreds of people watching at times. Hart's victim said the abuse had caused extreme pain and she thought she may have been drugged. She told police: ""I blame myself. I never did enough to stop him. I had opportunities to stop him but I was too afraid. I hate myself. I feel disgusted I let him do these things. I dream of it."" Judge Walters said it ""obviously leaves a permanent psychological mark"" and ""someone can't be subjected to this behaviour without life-changing consequences"". It was thought Hart been admitted to Morriston Hospital, but police discovered he was not there.

"This video can not be played Highlights of Jeremy Corbyn speech at Labour conference Jeremy Corbyn has said Labour now stands ""on the threshold of power"" because its policies are ""what most people in our country actually want"". ""We are now the political mainstream,"" he told Labour members in his 75-minute speech at their party conference. In what at times had the air of a victory rally, the Labour leader said they were a ""government-in-waiting"". He promised rent controls, attacked ""forced gentrification"" and said only Labour could unite the UK after Brexit. Laura Kuenssberg: Has centre ground moved Corbyn's way? What now for Labour MPs who criticised Corbyn? Recap: How Jeremy Corbyn's speech unfolded Reality Check: Decoding Corbyn's Brexit policy The Labour leader - who was greeted by a chorus of the football terrace-style chant of ""Oh Jeremy Corbyn"" as he made his way to the podium - lavished praise on party activists who he said had ""stopped the Tories in their tracks"" at the general election. He mocked the hostile coverage of his campaign, saying attacks by newspapers like the Daily Mail had actually helped his party's polling. ""Never have so many trees died in vain,"" he said. Mr Corbyn said the ""centre ground"" in British politics had shifted from where it was ""20 or 30 years ago"" and his Labour Party now stood for the things most people ""actually want"", even if a ""still broader consensus"" was needed for the party to win power. In his third keynote conference speech as party leader - Mr Corbyn also: Said only Labour could unite EU Leave and Remain voters Promised to ""repair the damage done by austerity"" Said his principles come from his parents and the North London community he lives in Urged Theresa May to call another snap election: ""Take another walking holiday and make another impetuous decision."" Condemned the ""intolerable"" abuse aimed at Diane Abbott - and sang Happy Birthday to the shadow home secretary from the stage Highlighting Labour's pledge to curb rents in the private sector, Mr Corbyn said young people's housing costs were three times those of their grandparents. This video can not be played Highlights of Jeremy Corbyn speech at Labour conference ""Rent controls exist in many cities across the world. And I want our cities to have those powers too and tenants to have those protections."" He added: ""Regeneration is a much abused word. Too often what it really means is forced gentrification and social cleansing, as private developers move in and tenants and leaseholders are moved out."" A Labour government would require any redevelopment of a housing estate to be backed by a council ballot of residents, he said. And anyone living there would be able to get a home on the same site on the same terms. He described the Grenfell Tower fire as ""an entirely avoidable human disaster,"" with the ruined tower standing as a ""chilling"" monument to privatisation and ""yawning inequality"". This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: Labour must be ""government-ready"" On Brexit, Mr Corbyn pointed the finger at divisions in Tory ranks, saying the Conservatives are ""more interested in posturing for personal advantage than in getting the best deal for Britain"". ""Never has the national interest been so ill-served on such a vital issue. If there were no other reason for the Tories to go, their self-interested Brexit bungling would be reason enough,"" he said. ""So I have a simple message to the cabinet: for Britain's sake pull yourself together or make way."" He backed Theresa May's call for a two-year transition period after Britain leaves the EU in March 2019 but claimed Labour was the only party that could ""unite everyone in our country around a progressive vision of what our country could be"" after Brexit. Labour would push for ""unimpeded access to the single market"" and fight to protect jobs and wages, while rejecting immigration targets, he told delegates. This video can not be played In full: Jeremy Corbyn's 75 minute speech He said the ""the capitalist system still faces a crisis of legitimacy"" after 2008's financial crash and the time had now come for a new economic model, with a bigger role for the public sector, renationalised utilities and more investment in infrastructure and skills. For much of his tenure, Mr Corbyn has faced heavy criticism from many of his MPs, including a no-confidence vote and a leadership challenge - but after the party's election gains he said this week had showed his party was now united and ""ready"" to take power. Mr Corbyn spent the summer touring marginal seats, and Labour aides said the party was currently selecting candidates in 76 Labour-Tory marginals, who would be in place by the end of the year. Responding to his speech for the Conservatives, First Secretary of State Damian Green said: ""Jeremy Corbyn's speech summed up the problem with Labour: lots of big promises, but no explanation of how they would deliver them."" Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable said Mr Corbyn's speech had ""once again confirmed he is one of Brexit's biggest cheerleaders"".

"The man was shot dead close to Gordano services A motorist who died in an armed police shooting near the M5 in Bristol had pointed a gun at another driver in the Midlands, police have confirmed. Officers fired at a car on the Portbury Hundred (A369) near junction 19 for Portishead at about 09:30 BST on Wednesday, an eyewitness told the BBC. West Mercia Police said it received a report about a driver with a gun on the M5 in Worcestershire at about 08:30. The police watchdog is investigating the shooting. Latest updates on this and other stories from the West of England West Mercia Police said it received the tip-off about the suspect when he was close to junction eight, near to Strensham services and the M50 junction. Police have confirmed a man was shot just off the M5 and close to Gordano services an hour later. A spokesperson for West Mercia Police said the tip-off was ""passed on to the central motorway police group"" and also to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC). Bullet holes can be seen in the rear window of the red car Avon and Somerset Police said it had referred the shooting to the IPCC, which has launched an investigation. ""We have been advised that officers were responding to reports of a man travelling on the M5 with a handgun and that he had threatened another motorist,"" an IPCC spokesman said. ""What appears to be a non-police issue firearm was found at the scene and will also be subject to examination."" He added inquiries were continuing to formally identify the deceased and his next of kin. A post-mortem examination is due to take place on Thursday. Forensic teams are carrying out fingertip searches of the scene David Ellison told BBC Radio Bristol he saw officers fire between six and 10 shots through the passenger window using handguns. ""They surrounded it. They shot maybe five, six or 10 times,"" he said. ""Then they dragged a man from the car to resuscitate him. ""It came off the roundabout towards Portishead and then was boxed in by cars."" A police spokesman said the shooting was not terror-related. ""We received calls from concerned members of the public travelling on the M5 who reported they had seen a man in a car with a handgun,"" he added. ""The vehicle left the motorway at junction 19 and officers stopped the car on the A369 known as the Portbury Hundred. ""Shots were subsequently fired in an incident involving police firearms and a man has died."" An air ambulance was at the scene of the shooting The Great Western Air Ambulance's critical care team also attended. The Portbury Hundred links the M5 motorway to the town of Portishead, to the west of Bristol.

"Ryanair will cancel another 18,000 flights between November and March, affecting the travel plans of another 400,000 passengers. It will fly 25 fewer planes to cut the risk of further flight cancellations. A total of34 routes will be suspendedthis winter, including Stansted to Edinburgh and Glasgow, Gatwick to Belfast and Newcastle to Faro. Earlier this month the Irish airline cancelled up to 50 flights a day through to the end of October. It blamed the summer cancellations on""messing up"" pilot holiday rosters. Ryanair said suspending more flights meant it could ""roster all of the extra pilot leave necessary"" in October, November and December. Ryanair: the 34 routes being suspended Passengers affected by the move will be offered alternative flights or full refunds and had been emailed about advising them of flight changes occurring until the end of October. They will also be offered vouchers of 40 euros (Â£35) one way or 80 euros return towards on alternative flights on top of any refund. The airline again denied it had a pilot shortage as some have claimed: ""In the current year less than 100 of over 2,000 captains left Ryanair (mainly retirements or to long haul airlines) and less than 160 F.O's [first officers] who have mainly left to join long haul airlines."" Ryanair added that it had more than 2,500 pilots on a waiting list and had offered jobs to more than 650 new pilots who would be join by May next year. In addition, ten days after saying it was preparing to buy the Italian carrier Alitalia, Ryanair said it would drop the bid to ""eliminate all management distractions"". Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said: ""From today, there will be no more rostering-related flight cancellations this winter or in summer 2018. ""Slower growth this winter will create lots of spare aircraft and crews, which will allow us to manage the exceptional volumes of annual leave we committed to delivering in the nine months to December 2017."" The airline also said the total cost of the flight cancellations to date was less 25m euros (Â£22m) and expected the cost of the free flight vouchers would be less than Â£22m. It said that it has had to scale back its original forecast for passenger numbers in the year to March 2018 from 131m to 129m but it said that it would not affect profitability.

"Three million savers in defined benefit pension schemes only have a 50/50 chance of receiving the payouts they were promised, a study has concluded. Some employers were under pressure to meet their pension obligations, the Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association (PLSA) said. High-profile cases such as the BHS collapse have highlighted concerns over the future of workplace pensions. The PLSA said one solution could be the pooling of resources into ""superfunds"". This would allow companies to pay a fee to transfer defined benefit schemes, such as final-salary pensions, to a larger fund - which would then have bigger investment opportunities. A standard deal for pension scheme members could see some receive better final payouts as a result, but others could see their expected income deteriorate. But pensions consultant John Ralfe described the superfund plan as ""outrageous"". He said there was ""no crisis in defined benefit pensions, so there is no need for crisis measures"" owing to a well-funded lifeboat system for collapsed schemes. ""The PSLA is trying to undermine all the safeguards put in place for members since the 2004 Pensions Act. It wants to turn the clock back to the days when companies could walk away from their pensions without fully funding them,"" he said. Can the UK afford the state pension? Sir Philip Green strikes BHS pension deal with regulator The in-depth study by the PLSA, the trade body for the industry, considered the outlook for defined benefit, including final-salary, pensions used by 11 million people in the UK. Defined benefit schemes promise savers a certain level of income when they retire, rather than relying on the success of investments. Employers have pumped in an extra Â£120bn in special payments to try to plug financial holes in these schemes, but the combined deficit of the UK's 6,000 schemes remains at Â£400bn. The majority of final-salary schemes had a sustainable model for meeting future payouts, the PLSA said. However, three million members of schemes faced a more uncertain financial future, it concluded. Ashok Gupta, who chaired the PLSA review, said there was a ""real possibility"" of a collapse for more high-profile pension schemes, and so the report's many proposals needed to be considered. ""The industry and government need to grasp this opportunity and tackle serious flaws that threaten the security of people's retirement,"" he said. A spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions said: ""Most pension schemes are operating well and the vast majority of members can expect to receive their benefits in full. But in the wake of several high profile cases, there may be more that needs to be done to support the sector. ""As we look at options such as the consolidation of pension schemes, we will continue to work with the industry, employers and scheme members to see what more can be done to increase confidence in defined benefit pensions."" Pension saving has become automatic for most workers, owing to the government's automatic enrolment scheme, but there are still concerns about a lack of saving across all age groups. Insurer Aviva estimated that two million older workers had dependent children or parents, and a third expected to delay retirement with others likely to reduce pension saving owing to the financial pressures involved. ""Many over-50s are shouldering the responsibility of putting their families' financial needs ahead of their own for a prolonged period of time,"" said Lindsey Rix, of Aviva. Aviva's survey did find that many older workers were staying on in employment owing to job satisfaction rather than financial need.

"This video can not be played About 1,000 jobs in Belfast are linked to the C-Series Boeing's trade dispute with Bombardier ""could jeopardise"" its defence contracts with the UK government, the UK's defence secretary has warned. Sir Michael Fallon made the comments after the US opted to impose a tax on the C-Series jet made by Bombardier. The proposed 220% import tariff could threaten Bombardier jobs in Belfast. Rival Boeing had complained that Bombardier had received unfair state subsidies from the UK and Canada. It claimed these subsidies helped the firm win a major order. In 2016,Boeing won a contract to supply 50 Apache helicopters,externalto the Army. Reaction to Bombardier tax ruling Analysis: Not the end of Bombardier row Why is company so important to NI? Bombardier-Boeing dispute explained Prime Minister Theresa May has said the UK's long-term partnership with Boeing was being undermined by its behaviour towards Bombardier. Mrs May said Boeing's behaviour was no way to operate in terms of such a long-term partnership. Theresa May said she was bitterly disappointed by the US ruling She said the preliminary judgement over Bombardier would cause uncertainty and that the government was doing everything it could to protect jobs in Northern Ireland. The prime minister said she had spoken to DUP leader Arlene Foster and Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill, and would be working with them both. Mrs May said she had spoken to US President Donald Trump ""more than once"" about the issue, as well as raising it during their recent meeting at the United Nations General Assembly in New York. Meanwhile, Bombardier said it would fight the ""absurd"" ruling. The firm is one of Northern Ireland's biggest employers. Sir Michael said during a visit to Belfast that ""Boeing stands to gain from British defence spending"" but that ""this kind of behaviour could jeopardise our future relationship"" with the firm. The proposed tariff could threaten jobs at Bombardier in Belfast ""We don't want to do that. Boeing is an important investor in the United Kingdom; an important employer in the United Kingdom. ""But we would prefer this kind of dispute to be settled on a negotiated basis and we will be redoubling our efforts with the Canadian government to bring about a negotiated settlement."" The UK government and trade unions fear the imposition of tariffs could make the Canadian firm question whether to remain in Northern Ireland, where it employs 4,100 of its 28,000-strong workforce. The ruling damaged the global aerospace industry and was ""frankly not what we would expect of a long-term partner to the UK"", said a UK government spokesman, while emphasising this was just the first step in a lengthy process. About 1,000 jobs are linked to the C-Series, the wings of which are made at a purpose-built Â£520m factory at Queen's Island in Belfast. Boeing said the dispute was about ""maintaining a level playing field"" The programme is not just important to Bombardier jobs in Belfast, but also to 15 smaller aerospace firms in Northern Ireland - and dozens more across the UK - which make components for the wings. The US Department of Commerce ruling, which could triple the cost of a C-Series aircraft sold into the United States, could potentially jeopardise a major order placed last year from US airline Delta - a $5.6bn (Â£4.15bn) deal for up to 125 of the jets. Bombardier said the decision was ""divorced from the reality about the financing of multibillion-dollar aircraft programmes"". The Canadian firm said Boeing was seeking to use US trade laws ""to stifle competition"". By Julian O'Neill, Northern Ireland business correspondent The outcome was predicted - but not the severity of the penalty. The tariff could triple the cost of C-Series aircraft in the US, effectively killing the market for Bombardier. It also puts a major order with Delta Airlines at risk - and things could get worse before they get better. Washington's Department of Commerce is due to make a second tariff ruling on 5 October. But a more important date is next February when the US International Trade Commission will either uphold the penalty or remove it. This was always the focus for Bombardier and its allies. Bombardier said it had created a ""superior aircraft"" that is more efficient and comfortable but Boeing was trying to prevent ""US passengers from realising these benefits, irrespective of the harm that it would cause to the US aerospace industry and the cost to airlines and consumers"". This video can not be played Sir Jeffrey Donaldson tells Today that Bombardier tariff may have 'devastating' economic consequences But Boeing said the dispute was about ""maintaining a level playing field"", and said its aim was to make sure that ""aerospace companies abide by trade agreements"". Delta, however, said there was no risk to US businesses as neither Boeing nor any other US firm produced 100-110 seat aircraft to compete with the C-Series. US Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross said one reason for the tariff ruling was Bombardier's failure to cooperate with the investigation. Allow Twitter content?

""The evidence we have to rely on is evidence not coming from Bombardier but evidence being proposed by Boeing and other outside parties,"" he said. The US government was ""not necessarily"" targeting Bombardier's Northern Ireland factory, he said, but added: ""If you're building wings for a plane that doesn't get built, that's a problem."" Analysts say that the ruling will increase tensions between the US government and Canada and the UK, both countries have dealsto supply military aircraft,externalworth billions of dollars with Boeing. The UK government and Northern Ireland Executive pledged to invest almost Â£135m in the establishment of the C-Series manufacturing site. The programme received Â£750m from Quebec's provincial government in 2015 when its fortunes appeared to be ailing. Critics say Boeing's complaints are unfounded as it does not make 100-110 seat aircrafts with which the C-Series would compete On Wednesday, Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard called the tariffs ""unfair"" and an attack on the Canadian province where Bombardier has its headquarters and employs more than 17,000 people. ""Quebec has been attacked. And Quebec will resist,""  he told journalists, adding that that Quebec remained committed to manufacturing the C-Series. ""Boeing may have won the battle but the war is far from over,"" he said. In 2016, Quebec invested US$1bn in the passenger jet. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has threatened to cancel the purchase of 18 Boeing Super Hornet jet fighters from the US in retaliation. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau threatened to cancel a Boeing order from the US Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland said on Tuesday that the government was disappointed in the decision. The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers - a machinists union - called the countervailing duty ""a protectionist and dangerous measure for the stability of the aerospace industry"". In Northern Ireland, CBI director Angela McGowan said the ruling put an important driver of Northern Ireland's economic growth at risk. Northern Ireland has effectively been without a devolved government for nine months, and Ms McGowan said the situation reinforced the need for a return of a power-sharing executive. ""With jobs and future prosperity in the region being put at risk by decisions made far away from Belfast, we need a devolved government that can speak up for and champion the needs of the local workers and businesses most affected,"" she said.

"Last week Reality Check highlighted themain points of the prime minister's speech on Brexit in Florence. Jeremy Corbyn's speech at the Labour party conference in Brighton had a much broader remit, but included a substantial section on Brexit. The BBC's Reality Check correspondent Chris Morris has been looking at what he said. What's the significance?There's an element of the pot calling the kettle black here. Divisions over Brexit within the Labour Party are pretty well documented and the only way the party has avoided Brexit overshadowing this conference is to have no votes on contentious issues such as free movement or continuing membership of the single market. Overall, Labour's policy on Brexit is far from clear, partly because it has become an issue that crosses party lines. There was nothing in this speech, for example, on how much Labour might be prepared to pay for a financial settlement with the EU before the UK leaves. What's the significance?What does Mr Corbyn mean by ""full guarantees""? Would Labour accept the European Court of Justice (ECJ), for example, as the ultimate legal arbiter of an agreement on citizens' rights, which is what the EU wants? Mr Corbyn didn't mention the ECJ in his speech, but shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer has suggested in the past that Labour would struggle to accept that. All sides agree that it is important to give certainty to EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens elsewhere in the EU as soon as possible. But once again there is an element of creative ambiguity in the Labour leader's pronouncements on Brexit. It is the negotiating team currently in Brussels that has to delve down into the technical and legal details to try to forge a compromise. What's the significance?For months, Mr Corbyn's stock line has been that Labour wants ""tariff-free trade access"" to the single market. That's now been amended to ""unimpeded access"" - presumably to take account of the fact that tariffs don't apply to the service sector, which accounts for more than three-quarters of the UK economy. What are known as non-tariff barriers (like regulations and standards) are equally, if not more, important. But even now, Mr Corbyn's remarks appear to ignore the EU's repeated insistence that you can't have unimpeded access (or ""frictionless trade"" in the government's current terminology) unless you are a full member of the single market and the customs union. Labour's London Mayor Sadiq Khan said this week that the UK should stay in the single market in the long term - others in the Labour Party disagree. What's the significance?This is another awkward issue for Labour because there are certainly those on the left who believe free movement has driven down wages. It's just as difficult for Labour to support immigration but also pledge to limit free movement as it is for the Conservatives - a case of having your stick of Brighton rock and eating it. Perception is important but aBank of England report in 2015,externalsuggested that evidence for a link between immigration and low wages was relatively marginal. A 10 percentage point increase in the proportion of immigrants working in an unskilled or semi-skilled service sector, it concluded, would be associated with a 1.88% reduction in pay.

"None of the diplomatic initiatives being pursued internationally is likely to provide a magic bullet to the Korean crisis, but they may slow it down In the wake of an escalating war of words between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un, and an unprecedented night-time sortie of US B-1B bombers and F-15 fighters off the east coast of North Korea, relations between the two countries appear to be moving closer towards military conflict and hopes for a diplomatic resolution seem increasingly distant. But are these fears exaggerated, and is the sign of resolution from the US and its regional allies in fact helping to provide clarity and reassurance at a time of maximum uncertainty? Superficially, President Trump's UN speech signalled continuity with the policy of past presidents, making it clear that military action (albeit on a catastrophic scale sufficient to ""totally destroy North Korea"") would occur only if the US were ""forced to defend itself or its allies"". Similarly, the dispatch of US aircraft north of the Northern Limit Line - the de facto border separating the two Korea - could be interpreted as a necessary reinforcement of deterrence intended to send an unambiguous signal to the North to avoid further provocations. The danger of this interpretation is that it is unduly optimistic and one-sided. The history of Cold War and post-Cold War conflict on the Korean peninsula, dating from the Korean War onwards, is littered with critical misperceptions of the intentions of the competing adversaries. By acting alone, as they did in the latest sortie, US military forces can advance the White House's strategic objectives without having to consider the South's interests The war of words between North Korea and the US and its South Korean allies (above) is taking place during a period of maximum uncertainty From Kim Il-sung's misplaced confidence that his attack on the South in June 1950 would not provoke a defensive response from the Truman Administration, supported by the United Nations, to Gen Douglas MacArthur's boast that he could push north beyond the Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) which divides the two Koreas, reuniting the peninsula without drawing China into the war. Time and again key actors have all too often misjudged their opponents with devastating consequences. Intelligence reports from South Korea suggest that the North has not responded to the US aerial show of force either because it failed to detect the incursion, or because its anti-aircraft facilities are too antiquated to deal with the US challenge, or potentially because the regime is trying to minimise the risk of escalation. North Korea-US tension: Should you worry? North Korea crisis in 300 words Yet, this cautious assessment overlooks the role of emotion in any potential escalation scenario. Mr Trump's intentionally humiliating description of Kim as ""Little Rocket Man"" will have been perceived in the North as deeply antagonistic to a North Korean leader for whom status and dignity are the bedrock of his legitimacy at home. Kim may therefore feel compelled to respond with further provocations, beyond the immediate, retaliatory insults that he and Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho have directed at the US president. One extreme option for the North would be to follow through on its threat to carry out an aerial test blast of a hydrogen bomb somewhere in the Pacific or in the waters surrounding the peninsula - an outcome that would be a major, and potentially life-threatening, escalation that could risk a military pre-emptive attack on the North by the US. South Korean President Moon Jae-in (above) is both in style and substance pursuing an approach to the North that sets him apart from President Trump A less obvious response, would be for the North to engage in low-level conventional provocations. These could, for example, include: The shelling of South Korean territory (comparable tothe attack on Yeonpyong island in October 2010) The dispatch of North Korea special forces to disable the South's missile batteries or threaten government personnel below the DMZ Cyber attacks on commercial facilities or South Korean or US military command-and-control sites in the South There is unconfirmed speculation that prior to becoming the leader of the North, Kim Jong-un planned and co-ordinated the attack on the Cheonan, the South Korean naval vessel that sank with the loss of 46 South Korean sailors in March 2010. That suggests that Kim's personal experience might encourage him to explore these options. What would war with N Korea look like? Such scenarios raise the important question of how the US would respond and with what level of co-ordination with its key South Korean ally. President Trump's national security adviser HR McMaster has made it clear that the US has four or five different options for dealing with potential provocations, including a number of military responses. South Korea President Moon Jae-in has apparently agreed tothe recent US bomber and fighter flights, but progressive critics in the South have warned that Seoul lacks any adequate means to compel Washington to consult it before deciding on an appropriate military response. By acting alone, as they did in the latest sortie, US military forces can advance the White House's strategic objectives without having to consider the South's interests - a situation almost certain to maximise fears of alliance de-coupling in Seoul that could damagingly destabilise US-South Korean co-operation. President Trump's intentionally humiliating description of Kim as 'Little Rocket Man' will have been perceived in the North as deeply antagonistic Gen Douglas MacArthur boasted that he could push north beyond the Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) which divides the two Koreas, reuniting the peninsula without drawing China into the war President Moon, both in style and substance, is pursuing an approach to the North that sets him apart from President Trump. While forcefully making the case for deterrence, he has continued to keep the door open to dialogue with the North, approving humanitarian assistance and most recently, in his speech at the UN reinforcing the case for a peaceful solution to the conflict. On the latter point, he is joined by the Chinese and the Russians, who are increasingly anxious about the risk of escalation. Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has backed Beijing's call for a suspension deal involving a halt to joint US-South Korean military manoeuvres in return for a freeze in the North's missile and nuclear tests. Twitter says Trump tweet did not break rules' BBC launches Korean news service However, the suspension deal is a non-starter, given opposition in the US Congress and within the White House. There is, therefore, an urgent need to find an opportunity for renewed discussions to restart diplomacy. For now, there seems little evidence that either the US or the North Koreans are making any serious efforts to talk to one another, either via the conventional channels via the UN, or even in a low-key gathering such as the one brokered in mid-September by the Swiss government in Geneva. In this context, the onus is on other international leaders to act. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has constructively suggested that a modified version of ""Permanent Five"" of France, Britain, America, Russia and China (P5) plus 2 [other countries] format used in the Iran talks might be applied to North-East Asia, presumably via a P5 plus 3 variant that might include the EU, South Korea and Japan in co-ordinated talks with North Korea. This video can not be played What would a war look like? In Moscow, the Putin administration is holding talks with Choe Son Hui, head of North Korean foreign ministry's North American division. Looking ahead to the 18 and 19 October Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, President Moon plans to send a high profile delegation for potentially constructive discussions with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. What weapons does North Korea have? How a Pacific nuclear test might happen Kim's 'dotard' insult explained None of these initiatives is likely to provide a magic bullet for the current crisis, but they may help to slow down the seemingly irresistible progression towards war. Here, history may act as a useful guide. In December 1950, it was in part the intervention of British Prime Minister Clement Attlee, who announced his plans to travel to Washington to urge the Truman Administration to refrain from using nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula, that helped alert the world to the risks of escalation and potentially devastating conflict. Now is arguably the time for similar interventions from our national leaders, even if the prospects of success are frustratingly limited.

"This video can not be played Sugar gets sweeter for UK farmers The UK's sugar beet industry is looking to ramp up production, as European Union quotas come to an end this week after nearly 50 years. For the first time since 1968 the UK can produce and sell as much sugar around the world as it would like. The end of the quota also means that French, German and other EU producers can sell more sugar into the UK. Experts predict that could result in lower prices - but the British industry is confident it can compete. Two years ago Paul Kenward, the boss of British Sugar, had a problem. Under the EU's quota he was only allowed to sell 1.056 million tonnes of sugar beet, but it had been a particularly bumper harvest and he'd produced more than 1.4 million tonnes. British Sugar has four factories in the UK, including this one at Newark, Nottinghamshire ""Customers wanted to buy from me, but I wasn't allowed by European Union rules to sell it,"" Mr Kenward tells the BBC. ""We had to store it for two years - that was very expensive."" From this weekend, those limits will come to an end after years of lobbying by the UK government. The 3,500 British farmers that grow beet - which looks like a big turnip - and British Sugar, which is the main processor of British-grown beet, see the change as a huge opportunity. UK beets account for approximately 60% of British sugar consumption British Sugar - which also makes Silver Spoon sugar - plans to step up production immediately and is looking to sell 1.4 million tonnes next year, up from 900,000 this year. It's also planning to export sugar to the world market for the first time in at least a decade. ""The UK is one of the most efficient producers worldwide,"" says Jane Clark, who farms sugar beet in Lincolnshire. ""It should put us in a good place to be competitive."" The changes are not linked to Brexit - and the industry is hopeful it will still be able to compete after the UK leaves the EU. Britain's other big sugar producer, Tate & Lyle Sugars, processes sugar cane, and so is not directly affected by the changes. There are nearly 10,000 workers in the industry's UK supply chain The UK consumes 2 million tonnes of sugar a year 60% of that comes from UK beets Another 15% comes from EU beets and 25% from imported sugar cane Source: British Sugar Analysts say the increased supply of sugar - not just from the UK, but from other major EU producers - should ultimately lead to lower prices. At the moment, white sugar sells for about 500 euros (Â£440) a tonne in the EU, compared with just over 300 euros a tonne on the international market, according toEU figures,external. Analysts say the price of sugar could fall - but it'll have little impact on sponge cakes Prices will become more volatile after the end of the quota, says Carlos Mera, a sugar analyst at Rabobank. ""Whether consumers benefit or not, I think they probably will."" However, the effect on sugary products, like cola and sponge cake, will be more muted, because the cost of sugar only makes up a small part of the overall price of those goods. For example, if the cost of sugar fell by 40%, that might lead to a saving of less than 1% on the price of a Victoria sponge cake. So far, though, sugar supply contracts in the EU are still much higher than international prices, says Callum Macpherson, head of commodities at financial services firm Investec. There is also the effect of the sugar tax on soft drinks to take into account. Taxing sugar: sweet and sour Sugar flavour will change 'gradually' Tate & Lyle Sugars joins campaign to leave EU The Food and Drink Federation says it is difficult to predict how prices will be affected. A wide range of factors, including world market prices, beet sugar exports, cane sugar imports, the price of other ingredients and raw materials, influence the price of sugary goods, it says. Although the end of the quota enables UK firms to sell more sugar abroad, it will also allow EU producers to sell more in the UK. French beet producers will also be able to produce more and could target the UK WhenEU milk quotas were scrappedin 2015, it flooded the market with oversupply and put some dairy farmers out of business. So will beet farmers suffer a similar fate? ""I don't think there are any sugar beet producers in the country that just grow sugar beet,"" says Jane Clark. ""We all grow a range of crops, whether it be wheat, barley, or  oats."" Mr Kenward says the industry learnt a lot from what happened with milk. ""We prepared for this for the last few decades, and can change production more easily than dairy farmers,"" he says. There's also the uncertainty around what trade terms will be in place after Brexit. British Sugar says that if the EU starts charging tariffs on its sugar beet after Brexit, the firm would ask the UK government to charge the same tariff on EU beet. As for trade with the rest of the world, British Sugar accepts that dropping sugar tariffs might be part of the deals struck with other countries. But it's still confident it can compete, as the UK is ""the most cost-efficient producer in the world"", Mr Kenward says. Brazil, Thailand and India are the world's biggest sugar cane producers When it comes to flavour, beet farmer Jane Clark says there is no difference between sugar from beets or cane. The climate and soil conditions in the UK, France, Germany, and the Netherlands suit sugar beet. Its production took off after an English blockade during the Napoleonic wars hit French cane-sugar imports. In comparison, sugar cane tends to grow in the tropics, with Brazil, Thailand and India the main producers. ""You can refine sugar down to various levels,"" Jane says. ""White sugar is the most refined, your brown sugar is less refined."" Ultimately, it's all the same chemical formulation: ""Sugar is sugar"" Jaffa quake as McVitie's cuts pack sizes Sugar flavour will change 'gradually' Audio, 00:01:11Sugar flavour will change 'gradually' Taxing sugar: sweet and sour Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles LA fires in maps: Thousands of acres, 0% contained 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Where is Greenland and why does Trump want it?

"Catalonia's police force has been caught up in the power struggle over Sunday's vote ""It won't happen,"" insists Spain's prime minister, and for the Catalan leaders trying to organise Sunday's vote on seceding from Spain, his words are becoming harder and harder to contradict. The nerve centre of the 1 October referendum - Catalonia's economy department - has been seriously damaged by raids carried out by Spain's military police force, the Civil Guard. Fourteen junior officials and associates were arrested, but more importantly close to 10 million ballot papers were impounded, and websites informing Catalans about the election have been shut down. The government in this north-eastern region of Spain admits its logistical effort to organise the referendum has been seriously disabled, as it defies a suspension of the vote by Spain's constitutional court. Catalan police, like these on the left, have been ordered to accept the command of Spain's Civil Guard (R) Spain's interior ministry has hired three ferries to accommodate the extra security contingent being sent to the region, and a power struggle has blown up over control of Catalonia's regional police, the Mossos d'Esquadra. Catalonia's chief prosecutor has ordered the Mossos to accept the command of Spain's Civil Guard to co-ordinate efforts to gather evidence of plans to hold an illegal referendum, and in effect stop it happening. But the head of the Catalan force, Major Josep LluÃ­s Trapero, is refusing to accept that order. And Catalan President Carles Puigdemont has spoken out against ""practices worthy of a totalitarian state"" as Spain tries to smash the planned ballot. This ship, decorated bizarrely with cartoon character Tweetie Pie, is one of three chartered to house extra Spanish police Madrid moves to take over Catalan police Spain plays cat and mouse as Catalan vote looms Mr Puigdemont insists it will. And after millions of ballot papers were seized, activists took photocopiers into the streets over the weekend to print off new ones. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has appealed to the Catalan government in an official address ""not to go ahead"" with the vote. ""(This) illegal plan of rupture has no place in a democratic state under the rule of law such as ours,"" he said. This video can not be played Why some Catalans want independence However, the BBC has learned from a senior minister in the Spanish cabinet that the government still expects ""a watered-down ballot"" to take place. The government is worried about the possibility of violence if supporters of the referendum resist police efforts to block polling stations. Does Catalonia want to leave Spain? Scottish politicians in plea to Spanish PM over Catalonia Could FC Barcelona be kicked out of La Liga? Beyond measures already taken by the courts, Spain's authorities still have further heavy weapons in their legal armoury if Mr Puigdemont and his associates refuse to back down. Spain's government-appointed chief public prosecutor, JosÃ© Manuel Maza, suggested on Monday that the Catalan leader could be arrested and charged with civil disobedience, abuse of office and misuse of public funds. This video can not be played Pro-independence marches so far have been peaceful but there were scuffles with police last week An article in Spain's constitution allows the government to ask the Senate for permission to use ""the necessary means"" to ensure that any of Spain's 17 autonomous regions such as Catalonia comply with national law. The vague phrasing of Article 155 and the fact that it has never been invoked mean it could allow the government to shut down Catalonia's government and even the region's parliament should Mr Puigdemont choose to follow through and announce independence in the event of a Yes vote on Sunday. Reality Check: Do referendums bring about change? If there is a vote and a yes tor independence, Mr Puigdemont has said that the first thing he would do on Monday is ""call for dialogue with the Spanish state and the European Union"", although he insists his roadmap to full sovereignty will go ahead regardless. The Catalan vote is turning into a battle of wills between Mariano Rajoy and Carles Puigdemont Unofficially, Catalan government sources admit a low turnout of less than 50% of the region's 5.5 million voters will force them to reconsider the situation. Mr Puigdemont and other Catalan government members have said they will ignore court rulings suspending them from office. From 2 October there could be a troubling situation in which two distinct legal realities coexist in Catalonia, with Spain declaring the region's government defunct while lawmakers bunker down in the Catalan parliament in Barcelona to vote for secession. Left-wingers from parties such as Podemos and nationalists from other regions like the Basque Country are pressing for a reform package that puts the option of a legal referendum on the table. But Spain's two largest parties - Mr Rajoy's Popular Party and the Socialist PSOE - do not agree with regions being able to hold a legal referendum on independence from Spain. Anti-Catalan sentiment among Spaniards may also be on the rise. Crowds have given a send-off to police contingents travelling to Catalonia with cheers of ""Go, get them!"" For the first time since becoming Spanish prime minister in 2011, Mr Rajoy has recently agreed to revise Spain's system of regional government, opening the door to possible constitutional reforms. Congress has agreed to form a standing committee charged with considering reform initiatives. Tinkering with Catalonia's autonomy statute with no chance of a legal exit from Spain would be a hard sell for regional politicians from the nationalist coalition currently in power. The pro-independence movement has demonstrated its strength in recent years with massive marches in Barcelona. But Catalans against independence want a say, too. ""We non-nationalists won't accept a reform that just gives us more finance and powers; we want a diverse and plural Catalonia with greater freedoms for Spanish speakers,"" said Ana Losada, a member of Societat Civil Catalana, which opposes Sunday's referendum.

"This T-shirt is a familiar sight at the Labour conference It is the love that dare not speak its name - so how many Labour Party members are secretly friends with Conservatives? You don't have to look far at Labour's annual conference in Brighton to see badges and T-shirts with the slogan ""never kissed a Tory"". It might be a bit of fun, but some people have read a deeper meaning into the slogan, seeing it as a depressing sign of our politically divided, tribal times. Surely people can put aside their political differences in the name of friendship or even romance? The slogan ""is meant to be very tongue-in-cheek, not divisive or hostile"", says Mancunian Chris Wills, who sells badges at the LGBT stand. In any case, the Conservatives have their own versions of it, he says, likely referring to ""I kissed a Tory (and I liked it)"". The idea of fraternising with the enemy is anathema to many old school socialists. ""I don't want to spend my time going on holidays with a Tory,"" veteran Labour MP Dennis Skinner tells the BBC. ""The idea would be appalling. When you go on holiday you want to enjoy yourself, not be arguing the toss about different things."" This video can not be played Labour conference: Delegates on befriending Conservatives Chris Owen and Paul Cooney discuss friendships with political rivals Does he have friends who are Tories? ""Doubt it. But it doesn't matter to me at all, I've never even given it a thought until you've raised it. I think it's a crazy notion."" Others take a more relaxed view of making friends across Westminster's political divide. Ealing North MP Stephen Pound - who once joked that he would disown his daughter if she came home with a Tory - suggested Labour MPs have always chummed up with those sitting on the Conservative benches on the other side of the House of Commons chamber. ""The tradition is that your opponents are sitting opposite you but your enemies are behind you,"" he says. ""Nigel Evans (Tory MP for Ribble Valley) and I have an understanding and we have been close friends for many years. ""I am friendly with Tories because I wish to show them the error of their ways, and show them the paths of righteousness."" Jo Sergeant and Harriet Bradley know some Tories This might reflect the reality of life at Westminster, where MPs from all sides work together on committees and swap cross-party gossip in the bars and restaurants, away from the tribal name-calling that we see on TV. But some MPs arrive at the place determined not to be seduced into friendly relations with the other side. Recently-elected Labour MP Laura Pidcock caused a stir last month when she said she had ""absolutely no intention"" of being friends with any of the Conservatives she encountered at Westminster. Stephen Stanners, from Blyth Valley, says Ms Pidcock's comments had been ""slightly twisted"" (she later clarified that she represented all her constituents and would work with Tories in their interests). Vince Barry: ""Stay away from politics"" ""At the end of the day she's not in Parliament to make friends, she's there to do a job for her constituents,"" he said. Vince Barry, chairman of Plymouth Labour Students, said he had personal friends who vote Conservative.

"Business partners Adam Bradford (l) and Jordan Swain on a fact-finding mission in Wadi Rum, Jordan A ""greed is good"" mentality no longer holds sway for the new generation of job candidates. Instead, they want to join a firm that offers them a good quality of life, rather than just a healthy pay packet. Londoner Adam Bradford and Californian Jordan Swain decided to set up their own business after struggling to find one which offered the right work-life balance. The pair, who met on Instagram, have visited almost 30 cities on four continents to do research for Bradford Swain, their social enterprise consultancy. Jordan says going it alone means they are able to work anywhere. ""We enjoy our ability to work from a cafe on a terrace in Morocco, from the beach in Kenya or from a hot-desk in central London if we need to,"" he says. Many young workers want the opportunity to travel with their job There are a growing number of people like Adam and Jordan who are happy to go it alone. And many firms are offering additional perks to attract and keep staff. What millennials are looking for in a job But such extras aren't always as good as they appear. ""I have spoken to people whose companies provided amazing perks - meals, healthcare and even alcohol if they had a party at home,"" says Dr Sandi Mann, senior psychology lecturer at the University of Central Lancashire. ""The downside is that they feel owned by the company and like they are expected to devote their life to it. They start to have less and less of a life 'outside' and work can become all consuming,"" she warns. With that in mind, we took a look at some of the best ones. Who?Airbnb, Macildowie Row Davies, a senior recruitment consultant at Macildowie, is living the high life on a free trip to the Grand Canyon Airbnb, an accommodation rental website, gives its US employees a yearly allowance of up to $2,000 (Â£1,500; 1,700 euros) to stay in any of its properties around the world. The firm was voted the best company to work for in 2016 on employer review website Glassdoor, with the travel perk seen as one of the most attractive aspects. Row Davies is a senior consultant at Midlands-based recruitment firm Macildowie, which also offers free holidays as an employee incentive. She has won two trips to New York and four trips to Las Vegas as a reward for hitting targets. Row says such holidays encourage employee loyalty: ""After you've been on one trip you don't want to miss out in the future, so you feel like you need to work even harder to get onto the next one."" Unlimited paid holiday leave Who?Netflix, LinkedIn, Virgin Management Some companies allow staff to take as much holiday as they want Netflix pioneered the concept of unlimited holiday. ""Our vacation policy is take vacation. We don't have any rules or forms around how many weeks per year,"" the firmsays on its website,external. Likewise, networking site LinkedIn offers its US staff unlimited discretionary time off, which it claims gives them ""more flexibility and a sense of empowerment"". When Sir Richard Branson heard about the policy from his daughter Holly, he decided to follow suit. Virgin Management - the investment and brand licensing part of his empire -brought in unlimited leave in 2014. Sharron Pomells, people operations director at Virgin Management, said the decision had received ""a great reaction"" from staff. But only a fraction of people who work for Virgin are in this division - 180 people - and it hasn't yet spread to other parts of the business. Neither Virgin Management nor LinkedIn could provide figures of how many workers had taken up the perk. And while unlimited holiday may sound incredible, the reality could be somewhat different. Writing for the World Economic Forum,external, emotional intelligence expert Dr Travis Bradberry says: ""Freedom gives people such a strong sense of ownership and accountability that, like business owners, many end up taking no vacation at all."" Egg Freezing Who?Apple and Facebook Apple and Facebook offer to cover the cost of some fertility treatments Apple and Facebook came up with a controversial solution to a notorious problem for tech companies - how to attract female workers to tech firms. They offered to pay up to $20,000 (Â£15,000) towards their US female workers storing eggs, if covered by their insurance plans. ""We want to empower women at Apple to do the best work of their lives as they care for loved ones and raise their families,"" Applesaid in a statement in 2015. Freezing their eggs is one way for a woman to potentially have children later in life, or keep their options open until they are ready. The schemes attracted criticism when they became public, with some saying they put pressure on women to defer having a family. Andthe success rate for egg freezing is not particularly high- in the UK, the pregnancy rate for transferring frozen embryos was 22.2% in 2014. Bringing your dog to work Who?Lots of employers, including Google and Mars Petcare Hubble employee Varun with Darwin the Shih Tzu It may not be ideal for cat lovers or allergy sufferers, but one boss says having a Shih Tzu in the office has had a ""sensational"" effect on his workforce. ""Judging by the figures, pets will be even more popular than things we generally see as workplace essentials, like showers, by 2018,"" says Agarwal Tushar, co-founder of digital office space platform Hubble. Dogs are a regular fixture in the office for 8% of UK employees, according to research by Reed.co.uk. Tech companies and pet-food firms are most likely to offer the perk. Google is famously staffed by dog-lovers and the search engine evenmentions the policy in its code of conduct,external, saying: ""We like cats, but we're a dog company, so as a general rule we feel cats visiting our offices would be fairly stressed out."" However, employees have to check with their colleagues first before bringing in a canine companion. Whether it's free holidays, time off or office dogs, the blurring between home and work life is a growing feature of many people's jobs. But psychologists warn against the possible downsides too. ""Everyone needs to be off duty sometimes - downtime is essential,"" says Dr Sandi Mann. The millennial generation shaking up the workplace rules What makes this Kate Spade bag unusual?

" This article contains graphic accounts of violence. There is a moment in the journey into Raqqa when you leave the real world behind. After the bombed-out Samra bridge, any signs of normal life vanish. Turn right at the shop that once sold gravestones - its owner is long gone - and you are inside the city. Ahead lies nothing but destruction and grey dust and rubble. This is a place drained of colour, of life, and of people. In six days inside Raqqa, I didn’t see a single civilian. Control of Raqqa as of 25 September 2017 They are somewhere inside, trapped by the so-called Islamic State and the Western coalition’s bombing campaign. IS uses them as human shields, and as bait, to lure out the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). It seems that not a single building has escaped the onslaught. Many have been crushed, flattened, or knocked to one side by the Western coalition’s air strikes and artillery. It is a barrage that never ceases. More than two dozen air strikes a day, and hundreds of shells fall on the city. Their target is the last men of the Islamic State. There may be as few as 400 left. SDF fighters The SDF, which is made up of Kurds, Arabs - Muslims and Christian - and Yazidis, among others, has been making good progress since the offensive began in June. It has IS surrounded. And with Western air power pounding from above, its front-line advances are chewing through neighbourhoods. It is only a matter of time - perhaps a month, maybe two - before IS in Raqqa is swallowed whole. This was the capital of the Islamic State’s unrealised caliphate. It was home to half a million people. But now it is fit for no-one. IS is already making propaganda capital out of the destruction. America says this a war of annihilation. Raqqa is the battleground and the victim. The Islamic State was a spectre of terror that had taken over our lives for four years. We grew tired and we despaired. Life had stopped. The only escape was to drown ourselves with work.” Hatem (not his real name), a shopkeeper in his early 30s, is one of the several hundred civilians who, in mid-August, took the risk and escaped a city plunged into death and destruction. When the SDF announced the Raqqa operation, Hatem says the people of the city were happy, if apprehensive, about the Kurdish role. However, the news coming from SDF-controlled areas was encouraging. “We heard about Tal Abyad becoming relatively stable. Prices of basic staples and foodstuff were decreasing. A barrel of diesel in Tal Abyad dropped to 12,000 liras (£15). In Raqqa it was nearly quadruple that,” the shopkeeper says. But it was the participation of the US-led coalition that the people of Raqqa were most excited about. The advanced weaponry, they thought, would spare them the grind of the urban warfare IS had been preparing for. “When a coalition air strike took out that French jihadi near the Clocktower Roundabout, I went shortly afterwards to check the scene,” Hatem, whose shop was near the drone strike, says. “He’d been consumed by flames in his own car. No-one else was killed. There was no shrapnel damage to be seen. We were excited because we thought it was this technology that the USA was bringing into the fight.” Destroyed street in Raqqa's Old City But the excitement was short-lived, as displaced people from the city of Tabqa started flooding into Raqqa. Tales of an “indiscriminate” bombing campaign, flattened buildings and hundreds of alleged civilian deaths rattled the local population. In June, Raqqa’s siege was completed and the US campaign was in full swing. Civilians were trapped inside with IS fighters. “America is a superpower. It was supposed to use laser-guided bombs and precision munitions. What did we get instead? Massive bombs, mortar rounds and countless artillery strikes. Is that how you liberate Raqqa? You’re murdering civilians instead,” Hatem says, his voice now quivering with a mix of anger and despair. Airwars, a group monitoring civilian deaths in Russian and US-led coalition air strikes Iraq and Syria, says that US-led forces dropped 5,775 bombs, shells and missiles in Raqqa in August alone, resulting in at least 433 likely civilian casualties. Ahmad, a Turkey-based Raqqa activist has documented the deaths of at least 750 civilians in the city since June - 520 of which he says were in coalition air strikes. Airwars, on the other hand, says at least 1000 Raqqawi civilians have been killed since June. The coalition has conceded four civilian deaths during the battle for Raqqa. It says it has adhered to strict targeting processes and procedures aimed to minimise risks to civilians. As ever, the Islamic State group was quick to use civilian deaths to its own advantage and pumped out one propaganda video after the other showing burnt corpses and maimed civilians. Lawyer Obeid Agha al-Kaakaji became the face of his bloodied city. With a deep gash across his forehead, Obeid’s face appeared caked with blood and dirt. His thick white hair and long beard were stained brown. The white of his eyes had disappeared behind a disoriented, tormented gaze. He was once a proud lawyer, known across the city of Raqqa for his philanthropy and concern for the downtrodden. Obeid Agha al-Kaakaji as a younger man “As a lawyer, Obeid was the caretaker of the family’s assets and wealth in Raqqa,” his Saudi-based relative Hani tells the BBC.  “When the siege closed in during Ramadan, he refused to leave, preferring to help people in need.” The BBC tracked down a former neighbour of Obeid. Ziad (not his real name) witnessed the coalition air strike that hit the al-Kaakajis’s house. According to Ziad, IS fighters had commandeered the house during the last week of June and set up a camouflaged mortar position in the courtyard. “They hid it right under the tree. They used to come every couple of days and fire a few rounds towards the east of Raqqa,” he says. “We tried to talk them out of it but they got angry and accused us of being apostates.” On 22 July, at about 10:30, a coalition air strike targeted Obeid’s house as Ziad was coming to visit the family for their usual morning chat and coffee. Obeid Agha al-Kaakaji before it was bombed That day, IS fighters hadn’t shown up to man the mortar, he says. “Just as I was about to knock on the door, I heard this terrifying noise and then everything turned black. It felt like a hurricane had picked me up and slammed me into the wall behind. I tried to run for cover, but then that’s when the second missile struck,” Ziad says. Lightly injured, but severely bruised, he picked himself up and headed towards the rubble to help survivors. He recognised his other neighbour, Abdellatif al-Sheikh, but he was already dead. A relative of Obeid’s, I’tidal, was in agony. “She was lying there, her legs contorted, mangled. She was begging me for help. I can still hear her whimpers asking for help. But I couldn’t do anything. She died there,” Ziad says. Six people survived, Obeid among them. He was right outside in the courtyard when the missiles hit. Obeid Agha al-Kaakaji as an older man A wall had collapsed on to him. Ziad says the lawyer didn’t look seriously injured, only “dazed and confused”. He transported him to an IS-run hospital in the west of the city. “They only tend to their own. As soon as they realised the injured person is a civilian, they stop caring. His injury becomes the lowest of their priorities - even if it’s life threatening,” Ziad says. Obeid, with his lost and haggard look, quickly came to the attention of the IS propagandists. But he was soon discarded. His condition started deteriorating the second day. An internal injury was suspected. Three days later he died, untreated and uncared for. Ziad is still angry about that day. “We know that for IS, the blood of civilians is very cheap. But is it the same for Americans? There was no-one operating the mortar that day. There were no IS fighters nearby even. It was there for nearly a month and their drones were flying night and day. Why bomb us? Why?” His question may never be answered. If you experience problems with this video you may want to change your browser. For Hatem, the shopkeeper who was excited about the US-led campaign, Raqqa was fast becoming a death-trap. At first, people he didn’t really know were being killed. But as time went by, acquaintances, friends and relatives were dying. “There were 20, 30 civilians being killed every day. People were getting buried under the rubble of their own homes,” he says. Islamic State fighters, he says, were getting aggressive with the locals. At one point, they stopped sending bulldozers and trucks to move the rubble and rescue civilians. “They’d ask, ‘You want me to sacrifice the life of a brother for a corpse?’ How can you argue with animals like that?” One day in early August, stuck at home with no electricity and nothing to do, Hatem began counting incoming thuds and bangs. “I started at 10 in the morning. By seven in the evening, I had counted more than 290 explosions. The bombing was becoming relentless.” And so he began plotting his escape. For the next 10 days, he began monitoring the route he planned to take, where IS had laid mines and at what time there were fewer fighters around. He chose to go south, past the Intercity bus station, past the Central Bank and to the bombed out Old Bridge. A date and time were chosen, and close-knit friends and family were asked to join. In the early hours of 12 August, under a Moonless sky, a group of 40 people had gathered near the Clocktower Roundabout to embark on their perilous journey to safety. “We took that chance because we all felt that to stay in Raqqa would be our death sentence,” Hatem says. “We set off at 02:55. We had elderly and disabled people among us. It took us nearly 90 minutes to walk one mile. By 04:30, we reached the bridge and stayed under its ramp,” he says. Had IS caught them, they would have been executed. “At the first break of light, we started moving again waving a white flag. The SDF saw us and sent us boats to take us to the other bank,” he says. Hatem sent word to another group waiting to take the same route. Out of the 302 civilians who set off the following night, 12 died stepping on IS mines. For Hatem safety came at a price. The SDF detained the men and started asking them about IS positions in the city. “We left 5,000 civilians behind,” he says. “Those positions are hidden in built up areas where our friends and relatives still live. Are they going to bomb them?” Asked whether he did reveal the positions, he replied: “I can’t go on remembering any more. This is very painful. I have to go and have some coffee and a cigarette.” Abu Abdo drives around central Raqqa in an armoured car that once belonged to Islamic State fighters. It's as ugly as it's uncomfortable. The unit’s Humvee is in for repair, after IS, in a common tactic, shot out the radiator. Also, Abu Abdo complains, the air conditioning doesn’t work. There is only one seat inside, the driver’s, and it is reserved for the Arab SDF commander. Abu Abdo is from Manbij in northern Syria, he is 24 but looks decades older. Abu Abdo at the wheel His unit is small, a ragtag bunch fighting in sandals and using Chinese-made AK47s. Almost no-one has a complete uniform. They are a militia, not an army. But they work well together, coordinated and fearless. Some of the fighters are very young. I ask one how old he is. He smiles and shakes his head. Like many young men and boys here in Raqqa, he knows not to answer. Abu Adbo hunches over the steering wheel, his beard almost touching the wheel. You can see some (IS) bodies here.” He points them out like a tour guide as the vehicle trundles along. The streets are strewn with rubble, but bulldozers have cut a path through the debris. There is no sign of life anywhere. The only sounds are shelling and sniper fire. The homemade armoured vehicle is hot and noisy inside, riding in it is like being rolled down a hill in an oil drum. “We got this vehicle when we attacked a Daesh [IS] base,” Abu Abdo says. “We attacked them suddenly. They had no time to take their armoured vehicle, so now it belongs to us.” I ask if it is wise to ride around the city in an IS vehicle with coalition aircraft and drones overhead? Abu Abdo “Before we go out we inform the operations centre and we tell that this vehicle is ours,” he says. “And we have a flag on the vehicle, a Syrian Democratic Forces flag. The jets can see that this belongs to us,” he adds. As we rumble along, I point out that there is no flag on the vehicle. He pauses for a moment, and then remembers: “We stopped there earlier and our men took the flag off.” He radios ahead to the next checkpoint to warn of our arrival. He takes us to a high building, near Naim roundabout, at the city’s centre. This is the edge of IS control, the front line. The vehicle lumbers across a street watched by IS marksmen. Abu Abdo wants to get as close as possible so that it is safe to get out. He misjudges and crashes with a loud thud into a pillar. I worry that the building, already half destroyed by coalition air strikes, will collapse. We climb out and enter the building, a former private hospital. His men there have piled up furniture at the bottom of the stairwell, in case IS rush the building. Further down the street, the black flag of the caliphate hangs from a building. The day is hot and still and the flag doesn’t move. It’s easily within reach, but in the direct line of sniper fire. For now, the SDF dare not remove it. They are trying to take Naim roundabout, the centre of Raqqa, the heart of the caliphate. It’s an important tactical point, overlooking many roads in an area that was full of shops, cafes and offices. Now it is called the Circle of Hell. The SDF has another reason for wanting to retake it, there their comrades and friends were crucified and beheaded by IS. When the roundabout falls, they say, they will truly cleanse Raqqa of the murderous Islamic State. IS fighters have mined the buildings and the roads, so few have been cleared. They’ve left motion sensors in some buildings so that when SDF forces enter, or open a cupboard door, a bomb detonates. Every home and workplace has been damaged. Even a captured IS weapons store has been left untouched for fear of booby traps. Abu Abdo shows me a camouflage balaclava, it’s one of the few things they retrieved from there. Their snipers have control of the rooftops. Keep your head down.” A call comes across the radio. One of his fighters has been shot and is trapped in a nearby street. When we get there the man can’t be reached. He has been hit in the chest. IS snipers are firing at the end of the street, and Abu Abdo’s men are pinned down. They are desperate to get to the injured fighter, but every time they move closer, more shots ring out. Suddenly there are two big explosions nearby. IS has dropped grenades from drones. The SDF fighters run and take cover in nearby shops. Abu Adbo pulls out his walkie-talkie, and looks at his phone. He calls up a map of the street and reads out the coordinates. He looks at me. “Air strike,” he says. Everyone is told to take cover. Abu calls in an air strike The injured fighter, his name is Nadin Abu Aziz, is still trapped on the road. He isn’t moving. I duck into an electrical shop, its shutters have been forced open. It’s quiet outside, as the men wait patiently for coalition aircraft to take out the IS gunman. We hear warplanes fly close and low, but no bang. The SDF fighters continue to wait. There’s no sign of life from the trapped fighter. Inside the electrical shop, there is a man-sized hole in the wall. A pneumatic drill lies on the floor. Through it is another store, and a stockpile of bottled water, and food. There’s enough to last a year. Beyond that, another gap in the wall, into another building, and a room with a bed, a stove and a motorcycle. This was an IS hideout. Is hideout It spans three buildings and the IS fighter would have been able to have access to all the floors above including the roof. IS has created thousands of these firing positions across the city. Mindful of IS booby traps, I don’t explore any further. Outside I can hear coalition jets flying low and close. The strike hits the targeted building precisely. Like the others in the street, it is a ruin. Time and time again, entire buildings are taken to kill a single fighter. It’s unsurprising so little of Raqqa is left. The SDF lacks the manpower to clear buildings themselves, so coalition bombs do the work. A thousand coalition sledgehammers, smashing down on a nut, building after building, street after street. The IS gunman is no longer shooting, he’s either dead or gone. SDF fighters rush to Nadin Abu Aziz, they pick him up and awkwardly place him in the back of the former IS armoured car. His eyes are closed, and it looks like the IS marksman shot him in the chest. When Abu Abdo returns with the news that Nadin is dead, no-one is surprised, but still they stop, stare and fall silent. One young fighter takes a crucifix from under his shirt and holds it while mumbling a prayer. Another crouches down in the street and says nothing. The Sun is beginning to set and the men are exhausted. But this is not an unusual day, says Abo Abdo, shaking his head. Yesterday we were supposed to receive some civilians but one of us was killed. We went to help families and babies, and one of us was shot in the head.” IS fighters were hiding, in disguise, among the civilians. “They attacked us with their men dressed as women, and there were big numbers, like a hundred,” he continues. “We guessed that they were civilians, and they also had children with them, and suddenly the civilians and children went to the side of the road, and then they started to fire at us”. Civilians in Raqqa, there may be as many as 20,000 in IS territory, are used as bait as well as human shields. “We’ll keep going,” says Abu Abdo. “We will sacrifice our blood for Raqqawi’s and our people inside, because they are having a tough time, a really tough time.” Raqqa is the doomsday city. Danger lies around corners and in the shadows. It comes from distant snipers, hidden bombs, and the deep tunnels that riddle the city. Even in areas that have been secured, IS can sneak back under the cover of darkness. The SDF has its own sniper unit. Four foreigners, from Germany, Spain, the US and the UK. A month ago, they were holed up in the old city, near the top of a building. It was getting dark, they were looking for any movement. They would wait for hours, then a shot would ring out - hopefully a kill. “We’re always on the offensive,” says Jac Holmes, from Bournemouth. “Daesh are always defending so they’ve always got the advantage. This has been their city for however many years now so they know it better than we do. It’s been very hard.” That night was particularly hard, the foreigners smelt smoke in the building. “Daesh have worked out how to start fires very quickly, they creep inside the building and try to smoke us out,” Jac says. They could hear the IS fighters moving, as the smoke grew thicker, they began firing downstairs. It was their only way of escape, but IS was waiting. They were trapped. But Jac and his unit had earlier found two IS suicide vests. They were rigged with detonation cords, like grenades. They pulled the cords and threw both vests downstairs into the smoke and the darkness. The explosion shook the building, Jac, says. “We don’t know how many we injured, they were all gone when we went down. The explosion was so big it put out the fire.” I first met Jac two years ago near the Turkish border. He was in hospital then, with a bandaged arm. It was an IS gunshot wound. He giggled about it at the time, appearing ill-equipped to be taking on IS. Before Syria, he had worked in IT. I wondered at the time how long it would be before he was killed. Jac has changed. The giggles are gone, his hair is longer, and he has a thick beard. He’s grown in stature. He won’t discuss how many IS fighters he has killed. “Why does everyone ask that?” he asks. But what is it like to kill a man? “You feel nothing,” he says, then pauses, “you feel excitement.” His weapon is an M16 with a large scope. It isn’t ideal, but Jac says: “We are never that far away from them, maybe 400m [1,300ft], it’s very close on the front line.” Jac's M16 His wage is $100 (£75) a month. He’s ambivalent towards the socialist ideology of the Kurds. Anything he needs, from food to clothing, is given for free. The $100 keeps him in energy drinks and cigarettes. His one credo, though, is his hatred of IS. The are a barbaric fascist terrorist organisation who essentially want to take over the world. If you don’t comply by their rules, they will kill you. It’s as simple as that.” There are fewer direct attacks and car bombs in Raqqa than there were in Iraq’s Mosul. Here, it’s the snipers and the roadside bombs that do the work. Mostly, IS doesn’t move, but lies in wait. As the men and women of the SDF’s Kobane brigade prepared for an operation near the city’s grain silos, they knew all of this, but still there will be surprises. Some look as young as boys. Barely hair on their top lips, they sit and load their magazines with ammunition. When I ask their age, they shake their head and smile. They know not to answer. Many of them are teenagers. The commander is Shevgar Himo. He has just celebrated his 24th birthday inside Raqqa. He’s half Arab, half Kurd, and is rarely without a tablet computer or new Samsung smartphone. Supplied by the Americans, they plot the IS retreat. His men are assembled, ahead lies a residential street, every house bombed, and IS still heading in the ruins. The target is the city’s grain silos, long held by IS and key ground because it gives the militants a high position over this part of the city. Shevgar Himo Shevgar Himo says: “The bulldozer is opening up the roads and the armoured vehicle is following behind. We are going to clean that area, then we will reach the other group of SDF that is attacking from the other side.” IS will be squeezed between the SDF forces. Immediately, the SDF take incoming fire. But they keep in formation and ensure their fighters don’t bunch together. That would only invite a rocket attack from IS. One by one they cross open streets, under fire. IS bullets zip past, missing the heads of the fighters by only inches. Armoured bulldozer At first things go to plan. Then comes the first surprise. IS snipers are good. The armoured bulldozer is covered in bullet holes, including right in the centre of the windows of the operator. But IS knows where to hit. I hear a couple of shots ring out. They’ve taken out the bulldozer’s radiator, it’s leaking fluid and needs to leave to be repaired. The second bulldozer goes in, there’s another shot, and a ""whoosh"" of escaping air. The IS sniper, hidden and invisible to the fighters, has shot off the valve on the tire. The fighters stand around and marvel at the accuracy of the shot. Bulldozer number two is now also out of action. So the fighters try a different approach. In minutes, at the end of a street, they plan a movement, half a dozen of them, including one armed with a rocket propelled grenade, to take out a sniper near a mosque. There Kurdish and Arab fighters work well together, but there are moments of confusion. One Kurdish commander doesn’t speak Arabic, his Arab counterpart speaks no Kurdish. It takes a third person to translate. When I ask some of the fighters where they are from, they reply with a vague “Rojava”, the Kurdish controlled area of northern Syria. But it seems they are not local. The suspicion is that some of the best fighters here are PKK, the Kurdistan Workers’ Party. Loathed by the Turkish government, it is also designated a terrorist organisation by the West. But here in Raqqa, they are some of the most effective ground troops in the battle. The fighters at the end of the street launch their attack on the sniper position, the noise is deafening, and the firing barely ceases for a second. Under the cover of fire, the fighter with the RPG, runs into the middle of street and fires at the IS position. Some more gunfire, then silence. But as I turn the corner to leave to get into the armoured vehicle, the sniper opens up again. About half a dozen shots, I hear them whistle past me, two smack into the wall. No-one is hurt. A boom of an air strike rattles the street and the sniper is finally killed. All of this for barely half a mile of street, but the fighters are closer to the silos now. The next day, they take them and a large swathe of Raqqa is back under SDF control. IS had promised to grow a new empire from these streets. Instead, the bodies of its fighters clog the gutters. Every few hundred metres, there is another one. Some cut in half, some still with their weapons. Two men were hiding in a building doorway, but they were spotted. They lie dead where they stood, one, his legs sliced from his body. The fins of the missile that killed them stick out of the concrete pavement. There are scorch marks at the building's entrance. An Arab fighter, with a skull and crossbones patch on his uniform, steps over the bodies, he has to check the building for booby traps. As he passes the dead fighters, he greets them, wryly: “Allah, bel kheir [May God make your evening full of good].” The fighters around laugh. The SDF forces document each corpse on their phones and tablet computers. They think it is mostly foreign fighters left inside Raqqa now. When I ask how many, most seem to agree: 400, no more. A tiny number making a last stand, but holding the might of the SDF and coalition at bay, and ensuring that what’s left of Raqqa continues to be destroyed. For four months Raqqa has been the battleground in the war of annihilation against the Islamic State. It is also a victim, broken and barely alive. The map on the SDF commander’s smartphone has a red square, it slopes at the bottom, passes Raqqa’s stadium and hospital and extends a few kilometres north. It’s all that’s left of IS territory. It’s in this area - little more than five sq km (1.9 sq miles) - where the battle for Raqqa will end. The Kurds are confident of victory. Already they are sending fighters to another front with IS, to the city of Deir al-Zour, further south. Air strikes inside the red box have lessened in recent days. It’s where most civilians remain. Jac Holmes, the British SDF sniper, is in no doubt the air power was necessary. “It’s made a huge difference. I mean, without them we would never have got this far. Let alone take Raqqa”. The Islamic State’s remaining fighters are said to be mostly foreigners, from central Asia, they have no love for the city, nor its people. They’ll gladly see it destroyed. It serves their propaganda purposes too. Here, they will say, Western bombs destroyed an ancient Arab city. If you experience problems with this video you may want to change your browser. In nearby Tabqa, I met Ismail Al Ali. “Raqqa’s citizens have paid the price,” he says in broken English. “Their city is destroyed. Raqqa has paid the price for all the world”. Nearby, a grandmother wipes her tears with her headscarf and says: “We left our beloved people, our children, everything behind, we know nothing about them. We only need to go back to Raqqa, we don’t need anything, we will stay in tents in the streets.” They haven’t yet seen what’s left of their city. When they do, they will likely ask, did so much of their beloved Raqqa have to be destroyed, so that it could be saved? Built with Shorthand",Positive,0.9734327

"Any polite gym-goer will wipe down a spinning bike or weight machine after a sweaty workout to stop the spread of germs, so should people do the same for communal yoga mats? Classes and fitness rooms are set to be busier - and sweatier - than usual, as thousands of gyms and clubs are opening their doors for UK National Fitness Day. Meanwhile, 10 million Britons are already members of a gym. It is usually up to members to use paper towels and disinfectant spray to clean off equipment another person has used - otherwise bacteria can lurk for several hours and viruses for several days. ""If you swab a yoga mat you probably are going to pick up viruses and certainly funguses,"" says Dr Seth Rankin, a GP and chief executive of the London Doctors Clinic. ""Minor things like athlete's foot can be picked up in any moist environment, it's why we wear flip flops in the gym showers,"" he says. A US surgeon - Dr David Anthony Greuner - recently issued a more serious warning by claiming that herpes, a virus more commonly associated as coming from sexual contact, could potentially be picked up from dirty mats. He says in a blogpost,external: ""Making skin contact with a dirty yoga mat covered in germs and bacteria can lead to skin infections, acne, toenail fungus and even transfer of the herpes virus and staph and strep infections in susceptible individuals."" Meanwhile, a study inSexual Health,external, a medical journal, also found a low risk of getting human papilloma virus (HPV), an infection which can lead to genital warts, by using unclean bike seats at the gym. But GP Dr Rankin insists the risk of catching a more serious infection from a mat or seat is ""vanishingly rare"" and tells people not to worry. ""If you were doing yoga on a naturist farm you'd certainly want to be very careful,"" he says, since herpes is usually spread through mucous membranes or broken skin. ""But where people are wearing Lycra or normal gym clothes the chances are incredibly slim,"" he adds. But can we rely on gyms themselves to keep the equipment clean? Sue Millward, Nuffield Health's lead for infection prevention, who monitors hygiene in its 111 gyms, says staff wipe mats and exercise equipment at the beginning and end of each day. But she says it is impractical for gyms to clean machines after every workout. ""We keep an eye on what's going on and who's using equipment,"" she says. ""If our staff see that somebody has been perspiring a lot and not cleaning they may go round and clean it."" Busier gyms do get cleaned more often, but Ms Millward says Nuffield also puts up signs to encourage members to wipe down equipment once they are finished. She adds: ""If somebody is unwell, they're not generally going to be at the gym and infecting others, and we do tell people not to come in if they've got illness or flu."" The best way to avoid getting ill from the gym is to accept that you will be picking up germs during a workout - and wash your hands and kit afterwards, says hygiene expert Dr Lisa Ackerley. ""Don't get too hung up about it,"" says Dr Ackerley, a chartered environmental health practitioner. ""There's a risk of cross-infection where you share equipment, but people do it and we're not dropping dead from it."" She says people usually have a shower after a workout - but during exercise, should avoid rubbing their eyes or touching the top of a drinking bottle. She adds: ""Kit can get really smelly, even if it's being cleaned, because people wash it at a low temperature."" She says a sure-fire way to kill germs is to wash clothes at 60 degrees Celsius, or consider using a laundry sanitiser. She adds: ""It's simple really, after you've been on your gym equipment, don't go and have a sandwich without washing your hands.""

"The man thought to have a gun was believed to have approached another man inside Childsplay Nursery Officers are searching for a man who walked into a Liverpool nursery carrying what appeared to be a gun. The man went into Childsplay Nursery in Heathfield Road, Wavertree, shortly after 08:10 BST. Police said he approached a man in the nursery before fleeing on a motorbike with a second man. No-one is reported to have been injured and there was ""no suggestion a firearm was discharged"", Merseyside Police said. Det Ch Insp John Webster said he believed what happened was ""targeted"" and the two wanted men had been ""looking for a man who was in the nursery at the time who was not a member of staff"". Police have stepped up patrols in the area and are conducting a forensic examination He added: ""I'm sure the vast majority of people in the community will be appalled to find that two men have walked into a nursery reportedly carrying a firearm when children and their parents were arriving at the start of the day"". Merseyside Police said officers remained at the nursery and a forensic examination was taking place. Police are also making house-to-house inquiries and have appealed for witnesses or anyone with information to contact them. Local councillor Andrew Makinson said: ""In an area like this it's very unusual, and for it to happen in a nursery, it's utterly shocking for the local community. ""I'm sure the nursery will be reviewing its security, as will other nurseries across the city. There probably isn't a great deal they can do against these sorts of one-off incidents, but anything they can do, they will be looking at. ""It's the sort of thing that really does frighten people.

"Jeremy Corbyn: We're ready for power His big speech closes annual conference Labour leader says Tories 'bungling Brexit' Says Labour would bring in rent controls And claims they are now the 'mainstream' Aiden James What does Germany's controversial third-biggest party actually stand for? As our coverage winds down, here's a recap of the final day of the Labour Party conference, dominated by Jeremy Corbyn's address to activists. A war of words has erupted at the top of Scottish Labour over claims of a ""plot"" to undermine former leader Kezia Dugdale. Ms Dugdale told the BBC there had been a ""lot of internal problems"" in the party ahead of her sudden resignation. Her allies have claimed there was a ""plot"" against her after interim leader Alex Rowley was caught on tape backing leadership candidate Richard Leonard. The row unfolded as Jeremy Corbyn spoke at the Labour conference in Brighton, saying that the party was ""on the way back in Scotland"" and thanking Ms Dugdale for her work. Read more.

Richard Leonard, a candidate for the leadership of Scottish Labour, calls Jeremy Corbyn's speech ""inspiring"". Mr Leonard says the Labour leader was ""right to highlight that tenants arenât being listened to and we need to
control rents"" - and is proposing rent control legislation in Scotland. ""The market has failed in housing â we need
a law that will control rents rather than the current free-for-all,  and
link any proposed increases to an affordability index,"" he says. ""I was particularly impressed with Jeremy Corbyn's statements on
the need to tackle the housing crisis that we have in every part of Britain."" âI think it was an excellent speech,"" says former Labour leader Ed Miliband of his successor's turn before the party faithful. ""I think the most
important thing about the speech was heâs right: there is a new centre ground in
politics."" ""Jeremy is right that he is shaping that centre ground and I think he
laid out a vision for what a fairer country looks like, whether itâs in housing
or public services or the economy, and I think itâs a great platform on which to
build.â Is there a cult of leadership around Jeremy Corbyn? âI donât think so,"" Mr Miliband tells the BBC. ""I think weâve always taken the view we
should respect our leaders and support them and I think what Jeremy did at the
election frankly it surprised a lot of people.""  Liz Truss said Labour were 'planning for financial collapse' First Secretary of State Damian Green said: ""Jeremy
Corbyn's speech summed up the problem with Labour: lots of big promises, but no
explanation of how they would deliver them. ""Labour say they are ready for power, but everything we've seen this week
suggests they're not fit to govern - and it's ordinary working people who would
end up footing the bill."" Chief Secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss said Labour had racked up spending
promises totalling more than Â£300m since their manifesto launch. ""No wonder they're planning for financial collapse if they get into power,"" she added. Ministers argue open markets are the best way to cut global poverty and boost prosperity after Brexit. BBC News Channel Lance Price, a former adviser to Tony Blair, tells BBC News that Jeremy Corbyn has seemed ""unsure of himself in the past but he was much more confident today"". However, he professes himself ""disturbed"" that the conference was ""a bit like a pre-election rally... rather than the introspection of a party that has just lost an election"". He argues that the Labour leadership seem to believe that the Conservative government is about to collapse and usher in a general election but this is actually ""very unlikely to happen"". Labour needs to win 60 more seats, which Mr Price says is ""a huge task"". He thinks there might have been too much ""self-congratulation"" this week. This video can not be played  The Labour leader is not the first politician to boldly claim he represents the political mainstream. ""Jeremy Corbyn has once again
confirmed he is one of Brexitâs biggest cheerleaders,"" says Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable. âCorbyn and the Labour leadership have clearly decided they donât want to
discuss Brexit, which is an appalling abdication of responsibility on the major
issue of the day. âItâs all very well for them to talk about properly funding our NHS, but the
fact is our public services are going to seriously suffer if the public
finances continue to deteriorate due to the Labour and Tory vision of Brexit,
ripping us out of the single market and customs union."" Daily Mirror ""Jeremy Corbyn declared Labour to be the 'new mainstream' of British politics in his keynote speech to Labour Party conference in Brighton,"" says the Labour-supportingDaily Mirrror.,external ""In the 75-minute address, he backed the Mirror's organ donations campaign, took aim at greedy property developers - and challenged Theresa May to another general election. ""And he made clear he sees the party as a 'government in waiting', insisting there's no need to cling to the centre ground to win elections."" The Sun The Sun,external, which has never been a fan of Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party, says: ""Jeremy Corbyn pledges to âinfectâ the country with Corbynism as he outlines hard-left plan to take Britain back to the 1970s in Labour conference speech."" ""Speaking at the end of a chaotic Labour conference overshadowed by rows over Brexit and anti-Semitism, the party boss insisted he is ready to enter Downing Street and impose his programme of nationalisation and tax hikes."" The speech was heard by a ""fanatical"" crowd, the paper adds. The Guardian ""Jeremy Corbyn promises rent controls and clampdown on gentrification,"" saysthe Guardian.,external Mr Corbyn was ""invoking the memory of the Grenfell Tower fire"" and saying ""regeneration schemes had often been cover for 'social cleansing'. ""Corbyn attacked the failures of government and management surrounding the Grenfell Tower fire disaster. ""'It was not just the result of failed political decisions, it stands for a broken system that Labour must and will replace,' he said, quoting a poem from one of his favourite writers Ben Okri, written after the deadly fire in the Kensington tower block."" The Daily Telegraph The Telegraph,externalfocuses on Jeremy Corbyn's claim that his brand of Labour politics now represents ""the political mainstream"". It's article continues: ""Meanwhile, he signalled a major shift in the party's Brexit policy as he said Labour would 'guarantee unimpeded access to the single market'."" The Labour leader promises rent controls and an end to ""forced gentrification"" in his big speech. This video can not be played  This video can not be played Labour is ""campaign-ready"" but needs to be ""government-ready too"", Jeremy Corbyn said. ""While
we were never going to come out batting for Jeremy Corbyn, his speech this
afternoon ending Labour's annual conference in Brighton marked a new low with
his promise for rent controls,"" says the Adam Smith Insitute. Head of research Ben Southwood adds: ""Rent controls will lead to smaller properties, shoddier upkeep, and long waiting lists to get a flat. What's more, it risks cronyism if councils get a role in deciding who jumps to the front of the queue. ""It may come as no surprise that the Adam Smith Institute disagrees with hardline socialist Jeremy Corbyn - but rent control is a rare case where economists almost all agree, left and right. 95% of top economists agreed rent controls in San Francisco and New York had worsened the amount and quality of affordable rental quality there. ""And you can see why: prospective tenants in rent-controlled Stockholm languish on waiting lists for 15 years on average. Expensive is one thing, but impossible is quite another."" Â© 2025 BBC.

Bombardier-Boeing dispute explained Prime Minister Theresa May has said the UK's long-term partnership with Boeing was being undermined by its behaviour towards Bombardier. Mrs May said Boeing's behaviour was no way to operate in terms of such a long-term partnership. Theresa May said she was bitterly disappointed by the US ruling She said the preliminary judgement over Bombardier would cause uncertainty and that the government was doing everything it could to protect jobs in Northern Ireland. The prime minister said she had spoken to DUP leader Arlene Foster and Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill, and would be working with them both. Mrs May said she had spoken to US President Donald Trump ""more than once"" about the issue, as well as raising it during their recent meeting at the United Nations General Assembly in New York. Meanwhile, Bombardier said it would fight the ""absurd"" ruling. The firm is one of Northern Ireland's biggest employers. Sir Michael said during a visit to Belfast that ""Boeing stands to gain from British defence spending"" but that ""this kind of behaviour could jeopardise our future relationship"" with the firm. The proposed tariff could threaten jobs at Bombardier in Belfast ""We don't want to do that. Boeing is an important investor in the United Kingdom; an important employer in the United Kingdom. ""But we would prefer this kind of dispute to be settled on a negotiated basis and we will be redoubling our efforts with the Canadian government to bring about a negotiated settlement."" The UK government and trade unions fear the imposition of tariffs could make the Canadian firm question whether to remain in Northern Ireland, where it employs 4,100 of its 28,000-strong workforce. The ruling damaged the global aerospace industry and was ""frankly not what we would expect of a long-term partner to the UK"", said a UK government spokesman, while emphasising this was just the first step in a lengthy process. About 1,000 jobs are linked to the C-Series, the wings of which are made at a purpose-built Â£520m factory at Queen's Island in Belfast. Boeing said the dispute was about ""maintaining a level playing field"" The programme is not just important to Bombardier jobs in Belfast, but also to 15 smaller aerospace firms in Northern Ireland - and dozens more across the UK - which make components for the wings. The US Department of Commerce ruling, which could triple the cost of a C-Series aircraft sold into the United States, could potentially jeopardise a major order placed last year from US airline Delta - a $5.6bn (Â£4.15bn) deal for up to 125 of the jets. Bombardier said the decision was ""divorced from the reality about the financing of multibillion-dollar aircraft programmes"". The Canadian firm said Boeing was seeking to use US trade laws ""to stifle competition"". By Julian O'Neill, Northern Ireland business correspondent The outcome was predicted - but not the severity of the penalty. The tariff could triple the cost of C-Series aircraft in the US, effectively killing the market for Bombardier. It also puts a major order with Delta Airlines at risk - and things could get worse before they get better. Washington's Department of Commerce is due to make a second tariff ruling on 5 October. But a more important date is next February when the US International Trade Commission will either uphold the penalty or remove it. This was always the focus for Bombardier and its allies. Bombardier said it had created a ""superior aircraft"" that is more efficient and comfortable but Boeing was trying to prevent ""US passengers from realising these benefits, irrespective of the harm that it would cause to the US aerospace industry and the cost to airlines and consumers"". This video can not be played Sir Jeffrey Donaldson tells Today that Bombardier tariff may have 'devastating' economic consequences But Boeing said the dispute was about ""maintaining a level playing field"", and said its aim was to make sure that ""aerospace companies abide by trade agreements"". Delta, however, said there was no risk to US businesses as neither Boeing nor any other US firm produced 100-110 seat aircraft to compete with the C-Series. US Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross said one reason for the tariff ruling was Bombardier's failure to cooperate with the investigation. Allow Twitter content?

""The evidence we have to rely on is evidence not coming from Bombardier but evidence being proposed by Boeing and other outside parties,"" he said. The US government was ""not necessarily"" targeting Bombardier's Northern Ireland factory, he said, but added: ""If you're building wings for a plane that doesn't get built, that's a problem."" Analysts say that the ruling will increase tensions between the US government and Canada and the UK, both countries have dealsto supply military aircraft,externalworth billions of dollars with Boeing. The UK government and Northern Ireland Executive pledged to invest almost Â£135m in the establishment of the C-Series manufacturing site. The programme received Â£750m from Quebec's provincial government in 2015 when its fortunes appeared to be ailing. Critics say Boeing's complaints are unfounded as it does not make 100-110 seat aircrafts with which the C-Series would compete On Wednesday, Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard called the tariffs ""unfair"" and an attack on the Canadian province where Bombardier has its headquarters and employs more than 17,000 people. ""Quebec has been attacked. And Quebec will resist,""  he told journalists, adding that that Quebec remained committed to manufacturing the C-Series. ""Boeing may have won the battle but the war is far from over,"" he said. In 2016, Quebec invested US$1bn in the passenger jet. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has threatened to cancel the purchase of 18 Boeing Super Hornet jet fighters from the US in retaliation. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau threatened to cancel a Boeing order from the US Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland said on Tuesday that the government was disappointed in the decision. The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers - a machinists union - called the countervailing duty ""a protectionist and dangerous measure for the stability of the aerospace industry"". In Northern Ireland, CBI director Angela McGowan said the ruling put an important driver of Northern Ireland's economic growth at risk. Northern Ireland has effectively been without a devolved government for nine months, and Ms McGowan said the situation reinforced the need for a return of a power-sharing executive. ""With jobs and future prosperity in the region being put at risk by decisions made far away from Belfast, we need a devolved government that can speak up for and champion the needs of the local workers and businesses most affected,"" she said.

"Kurds took to the streets of Kirkuk on Monday to celebrate after voting in the referendum People living in northern Iraq voted overwhelmingly in favour of independence for the Kurdistan Region in Monday's controversial referendum. The electoral commission said 92% of the 3.3 million Kurds and non-Kurds who cast their ballots supported secession. The announcement came despite a last-minute appeal for the result to be ""cancelled"" from Iraq's prime minister. Haider al-Abadi urged Kurds to instead engage in dialogue with Baghdad ""in the framework of the constitution"". Kurdish leaders say the ""Yes"" vote will give them a mandate to start negotiations on secession with the central government in Baghdad and neighbouring countries. Iraqi Kurdish referendum: What is at stake? Iraqi Kurdistan profile Iraq's parliament meanwhile asked the prime minister to deploy troops to the oil-rich region of Kirkuk and other disputed areas held by Kurdish forces. Kurdish Peshmerga fighters took control of Kirkuk, a multi-ethnic region claimed by the Kurds and Arab-led central government, when jihadist militants from so-called Islamic State (IS) swept across northern Iraq in 2014 and the Iraqi army collapsed. The referendum was held in the three Iraqi provinces that make up the Kurdistan Region, as well as ""areas of Kurdistan outside the region's administration"". Electoral commission officials told a news conference in Irbil on Wednesday afternoon that 2,861,000 people had voted ""yes"" to independence and 224,000 had voted ""no"". Turnout was 72.61% among those eligible to vote. In a speech to parliament before the result was announced, Mr Abadi insisted that he would ""never have a dialogue"" about the referendum's outcome with the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG). Haider al-Abadi (left) met Parliament Speaker Saleem al-Jubouri on Wednesday The vote was vehemently opposed by Baghdad and much of the international community, which expressed concern about its potentially destabilising effects, particularly on the battle against IS. Mr Abadi said his priority now was to ""preserve citizens' security"" and promised to ""defend Kurdish citizens inside or outside"" the Kurdistan Region. ""We will impose Iraq's rule in all districts of the region with the force of the constitution,"" he added. This video can not be played Iraq's Kurdish region foreign affairs minister says independence is 'inevitable' The prime minister also reaffirmed his threat to prevent direct international flights to the Kurdistan Region if Baghdad was not given control of Irbil and Sulaimaniya airports by Friday afternoon. The KRG's transport minister said he was seeking clarification from Baghdad. ""We don't understand how to give them the two airports,"" Mowlud Murad told reporters. ""They are already subject to the Iraqi Civil Aviation Authority."" Mr Abadi has demanded that his government be given control of Irbil international airport The United States, which was ""deeply disappointed"" that the referendum was held, has also questioned Mr Abadi's threat to ban international flights. State department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said on Tuesday that such a move ""would not be an example of engaging constructively"". Lebanon's Middle East Airlines and EgyptAir meanwhile warned customers they would halt flights to Irbil from Friday until further notice. This video can not be played Kexit? Iraqi Kurdistan referendum explained - by the voters themselves Mr Abadi has also demanded control of all border crossings and oil revenues. Kurds are the fourth-largest ethnic group in the Middle East but they have never obtained a permanent nation state.

"Karren Brady, Lord Sugar and Claude Littner all return for the new season The 13th series of the Apprentice begins next week, more than a decade after the show launched on BBC Two. It remains hugely popular, but how much life does the series have left? The chances are you've probably never watched the German version of The Apprentice. Or the Spanish one. Or the Finnish, Turkish, Dutch, Belgian or Norwegian ones. They all existed, most of them in the mid-noughties when the format was at its peak, but nearly all have now been wound down. In the UK, however, the show remains stubbornly popular. The finals of the most recent three seasons all attracted more than seven million viewers, according to ratings body Barb. ""That's because of us three,"" jokes Lord Sugar, referring to himself and sidekicks Karren Brady and Claude Littner. Eighteen new candidates will appear in the new series To be fair, he's probably not wrong - the personalities are a key part of the show, and Lord Sugar doesn't show any signs of wanting to pack it in any time soon. ""I'm very happy to continue doing it,"" he says when asked by BBC News. ""As far as I'm concerned, I'm up for it, before they put me in the coffin."" He continues: ""I think we're all proud of the brand really. You refer to it failing in other markets - we've kept it going, and we've kept it going because it has life in it, and we are passionate about the brand. ""We're making sure that it's not just good entertainment, but actually delivers the right message. These three don't half enjoy going outside on a cloudy day ""But of course the decision for new series remains and has always remained with the BBC. We're ready and waiting but it's up to the BBC to decide whether they wish to continue."" Well, we asked the BBC, who said: ""The Apprentice is a much loved BBC One show and we are committed to it on the channel. An announcement about future series will be made in due course."" Lord Sugar also honed in on one key aspect of the British version of the show that he thinks gave it a new lease of life. ""We changed the format after series six, to one of going into business with people,"" he explained. The first few series of the show saw an apprentice hired by Lord Sugar to work in his company, but now he invests Â£250,000 in the winner's business idea. ""That has become an absolute success as far as I'm concerned,"" he said. Last year's winner Alana Spencer makes a guest appearance in the first episode ""You see the [former winners], they're all making money, and for me it's quite exciting to really start from the grass roots again."" (He's referring to cameo appearances in the first episode of the new series from Ricky Martin, Leah Totton, Mark Wright, Alana Spencer and Tom Pellereau, who explain to the candidates what winning the show did for them.) Lord Sugar has previouslysuggestedthat the BBC should broadcast a spin-off show focusing on the winners' stories, but said on Tuesday: ""There's a problem with compliance, something to do with promoting business or something like that which means the BBC can't do it."" Not one to shy away from giving his opinion on basically anything, Lord Sugar continued to share his thoughts about what he would do if he was the BBC's director general. The Voice used to air on the BBC but later moved to ITV ""I've had a lot of thoughts about the BBC. They're a great organisation, we pay Â£12 a month, and when you compare that to other things you pay for your phone, internet, Sky television or whatever, the value you get at the BBC is tremendous,"" he said. Sounds like he wouldn't be opposed to becoming DG, right? ""The problem is..."" Oh, wait. ""The problem is that too much politics goes on, to suppress them in spending a bit of money, because it's always, 'Oh well it's licence fee payers' money'. ""What this leads to is them losing the ability to pay the going price for programmes like The Voice or Bake Off, and I think that's wrong."" Bake Off 1.0 (pre moving to Channel 4) He continues: ""Hands are tied internally because people are frightened to spend money. Now, having said all that, if I was in charge of the BBC, I would find that money. ""And the only way you find that money is to get rid of some of the money which I would consider to be wasted within the organisation. ""But I do feel for the BBC because you invent a programme and then someone else steals it from you, and you can't compete because your hands are tied because of policy. ""And you've got some idiot in Parliament moaning about the late and great Sir Bruce Forsyth, for example, having hisbirthday cake paid for,externalby licence fee payers' money, and that is absolutely outrageous. ""So would I like the job? Well I wouldn't mind the job, but I doubt very much whether they'll give it to me,"" he laughs, ""because whoever did give it to me would end up without a job."" Lord Sugar will appear on GMB with Piers Morgan next week Ahead of the new series airing next Wednesday, Lord Sugar plans to appear on Good Morning Britain with his long-term nemesis Piers Morgan. ""Yes, I'll get my boxing gloves ready,"" he joked. ""[Piers] doesn't stop talking about how he won the American Apprentice now, it's so boring. ""You can see Susanna Reid yawning every time he brings it up, and every time he mentions what a good friend he is of [President] Trump, who incidentally hasn't spoken to him since he won the election."" Eeesh. Probably a good idea to stock up on popcorn for that one. The Apprentice begins on Wednesday 4 October at 21:00 BST on BBC One.

"A woman has been arrested by counter-terrorism police on suspicion of breaching the Official Secrets Act, the Metropolitan Police has said. The 65-year-old had been working for the government and was detained after intelligence was received by police. Scotland Yard said she was arrested at a property in north London under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act. The woman is in custody at a south London police station and a north London address is being searched. Police have not identified the government department she was working for as a contractor. BBC home affairs correspondent Daniel Sandford said the fact the woman is being held under Section 1 of the Official Secrets Act 1911 means she is suspected of spying. She is not thought to have been working for any of the intelligence agencies but the arrest is based on MI5 information, BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera said.

Officers fired shots at a car on the Portbury Hundred (A369) near junction 19 for Portishead at about 09:30 BST, an eyewitness told the BBC. Avon and Somerset Police said it acted following reports of a man in a car with a handgun. The Independent Police Complaints Commission said there were reports ""he had threatened another motorist"". Latest updates from the scene Bullet holes can be seen in the rear window of the red car Forensic teams are carrying out fingertip searches of the scene A police spokesman said: ""Earlier this morning we received calls from concerned members of the public travelling on the M5 who reported they had seen a man in a car with a handgun. ""The vehicle left the motorway at junction 19 and officers stopped the car on the A369 known as the Portbury Hundred. ""Shots were subsequently fired in an incident involving police firearms and a man has died. ""We referred the incident to the IPCC: they're now on the scene carrying out an independent investigation which we are supporting."" The road will remain closed overnight whilst investigations continue. The force added it was not terror-related. An IPCC spokesman confirmed it had launched an investigation and said its teams have been at the scene gathering evidence. ""We have been advised that officers were responding to reports of a man travelling on the M5 with a handgun and that he had threatened another motorist,"" he said. ""What appears to be a non-police issue firearm was found at the scene and will also be subject to examination."" He added inquiries were continuing to formally identify the deceased and his next of kin. A post mortem is due to take place on Thursday. IPCC Commissioner Cindy Butts: ""At this stage we are currently investigating the circumstances of the incident and no individual police officer is under investigation. ""There would have been a large number of witnesses, given this incident took place on a busy road during rush hour. We would ask that anyone with information that may assist our independent investigation make contact with our investigators.""

An object on the roof of the red car looks like a handgun to the naked eye. There are bullet holes in the windows and shards of shattered glass on the tarmac below. The driver's door is open. This afternoon police erected a large privacy barrier across the end of the road and extended the cordon around the scene. A large blue police tent has been carried in and installed next to the car. David Ellison told BBC Radio Bristol he saw officers fire between six and 10 shots through the passenger window using handguns. ""They surrounded it. They shot maybe five, six or 10 times,"" he said. ""Then they dragged a man from the car to resuscitate him. ""It came off the roundabout towards Portishead and then was boxed in by cars."" Lisa Fussell told the BBC she had been driving along the Portbury Hundred when she came across a scene of ""chaos"" involving two unmarked police cars and ""five or six officers dressed all in black"". ""The air ambulance landed in front of us. The medics got out and ran to a red car. It looked like someone had been taken ill,"" she said.

"Emma Dent Coad was elected MP for Kensington in June A Labour MP who claimed Prince Harry cannot fly a helicopter has defended her comments. Emma Dent Coad, who reportedlymade the remarks,externalat a Labour fringe event, said she was told ""it's an absolute fact"", but added that she could not prove it. The MP for Kensington - which includes Kensington Palace - told the BBC taxpayers should not fund the monarchy. Prince Harry qualified as an Apache helicopter commanderin 2013. The Labour Party has declined to comment. The MP, who was elected in June, told theBBC's Daily Politics: ""Somebody else will tell me whether or not that's true but I've been told that's an absolute fact that somebody sits beside him and drives the helicopters for him."" John Woodcock, former chairman of Labour's backbench defence committee, issueda statement,externalsaying the ""highly inaccurate comments"" did not reflect the views of his party. He said the prince deserved ""praise and respect"" for his service in the armed forces. ""I am really sorry this happened,"" he added. Kensington Palace has not commented. Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner said she was more interested in the contribution the Royal Family makes to the UK. ""We have different views in the Labour Party... but I actually think Prince William and Prince Harry have made the royal family more trendy again. I think there is a role for them - they're part of the staple British diet,"" she told the BBC.

Defence minister Tobias Ellwoodinvited,externalMs Dent Coad to go the games, adding: ""Learn how it started... and who inspires our injured heroes"". In an interview with the BBC, Ms Dent Coad questioned why the UK - as a modern democracy - was ""buying into this archaic system"". ""The immediate issue is why we are paying an absolute fortune in tax to people who are already very comfortably off for them to do charity work - which they do excellently - but half of north Kensington is doing charity work for nothing,"" she said. Asked whether she called the Royal Family ""ridiculous"", she said: ""I think my point was that the system is ridiculous. ""I don't know them, I'm sure they're perfectly decent human beings.

A war of words has erupted at the top of Scottish Labour over claims of a ""plot"" to undermine former leader Kezia Dugdale. Ms Dugdale told the BBC there had been a ""lot of internal problems"" in the party ahead of her sudden resignation. Her allies have claimed there was a ""plot"" against her after interim leader Alex Rowley was caught on tape backing leadership candidate Richard Leonard. The row unfolded as Jeremy Corbyn spoke at the Labour conference in Brighton, saying that the party was ""on the way back in Scotland"" and thanking Ms Dugdale for her work. Read more.

Richard Leonard, a candidate for the leadership of Scottish Labour, calls Jeremy Corbyn's speech ""inspiring"". Mr Leonard says the Labour leader was ""right to highlight that tenants arenât being listened to and we need to
control rents"" - and is proposing rent control legislation in Scotland. ""The market has failed in housing â we need
a law that will control rents rather than the current free-for-all,  and
link any proposed increases to an affordability index,"" he says. ""I was particularly impressed with Jeremy Corbyn's statements on
the need to tackle the housing crisis that we have in every part of Britain."" âI think it was an excellent speech,"" says former Labour leader Ed Miliband of his successor's turn before the party faithful. ""I think the most
important thing about the speech was heâs right: there is a new centre ground in
politics."" ""Jeremy is right that he is shaping that centre ground and I think he
laid out a vision for what a fairer country looks like, whether itâs in housing
or public services or the economy, and I think itâs a great platform on which to
build.â Is there a cult of leadership around Jeremy Corbyn? âI donât think so,"" Mr Miliband tells the BBC. ""I think weâve always taken the view we
should respect our leaders and support them and I think what Jeremy did at the
election frankly it surprised a lot of people.""  Liz Truss said Labour were 'planning for financial collapse' First Secretary of State Damian Green said: ""Jeremy
Corbyn's speech summed up the problem with Labour: lots of big promises, but no
explanation of how they would deliver them. ""Labour say they are ready for power, but everything we've seen this week
suggests they're not fit to govern - and it's ordinary working people who would
end up footing the bill."" Chief Secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss said Labour had racked up spending
promises totalling more than Â£300m since their manifesto launch. ""No wonder they're planning for financial collapse if they get into power,"" she added. Ministers argue open markets are the best way to cut global poverty and boost prosperity after Brexit. BBC News Channel Lance Price, a former adviser to Tony Blair, tells BBC News that Jeremy Corbyn has seemed ""unsure of himself in the past but he was much more confident today"". However, he professes himself ""disturbed"" that the conference was ""a bit like a pre-election rally... rather than the introspection of a party that has just lost an election"". He argues that the Labour leadership seem to believe that the Conservative government is about to collapse and usher in a general election but this is actually ""very unlikely to happen"". Labour needs to win 60 more seats, which Mr Price says is ""a huge task"". He thinks there might have been too much ""self-congratulation"" this week. This video can not be played  The Labour leader is not the first politician to boldly claim he represents the political mainstream. ""Jeremy Corbyn has once again
confirmed he is one of Brexitâs biggest cheerleaders,"" says Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable. âCorbyn and the Labour leadership have clearly decided they donât want to
discuss Brexit, which is an appalling abdication of responsibility on the major
issue of the day. âItâs all very well for them to talk about properly funding our NHS, but the
fact is our public services are going to seriously suffer if the public
finances continue to deteriorate due to the Labour and Tory vision of Brexit,
ripping us out of the single market and customs union."" Daily Mirror ""Jeremy Corbyn declared Labour to be the 'new mainstream' of British politics in his keynote speech to Labour Party conference in Brighton,"" says the Labour-supportingDaily Mirrror.,external ""In the 75-minute address, he backed the Mirror's organ donations campaign, took aim at greedy property developers - and challenged Theresa May to another general election. ""And he made clear he sees the party as a 'government in waiting', insisting there's no need to cling to the centre ground to win elections."" The Sun The Sun,external, which has never been a fan of Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party, says: ""Jeremy Corbyn pledges to âinfectâ the country with Corbynism as he outlines hard-left plan to take Britain back to the 1970s in Labour conference speech."" ""Speaking at the end of a chaotic Labour conference overshadowed by rows over Brexit and anti-Semitism, the party boss insisted he is ready to enter Downing Street and impose his programme of nationalisation and tax hikes."" The speech was heard by a ""fanatical"" crowd, the paper adds. The Guardian ""Jeremy Corbyn promises rent controls and clampdown on gentrification,"" saysthe Guardian.,external Mr Corbyn was ""invoking the memory of the Grenfell Tower fire"" and saying ""regeneration schemes had often been cover for 'social cleansing'. ""Corbyn attacked the failures of government and management surrounding the Grenfell Tower fire disaster. ""'It was not just the result of failed political decisions, it stands for a broken system that Labour must and will replace,' he said, quoting a poem from one of his favourite writers Ben Okri, written after the deadly fire in the Kensington tower block."" The Daily Telegraph The Telegraph,externalfocuses on Jeremy Corbyn's claim that his brand of Labour politics now represents ""the political mainstream"". It's article continues: ""Meanwhile, he signalled a major shift in the party's Brexit policy as he said Labour would 'guarantee unimpeded access to the single market'."" The Labour leader promises rent controls and an end to ""forced gentrification"" in his big speech. This video can not be played  This video can not be played Labour is ""campaign-ready"" but needs to be ""government-ready too"", Jeremy Corbyn said. ""While
we were never going to come out batting for Jeremy Corbyn, his speech this
afternoon ending Labour's annual conference in Brighton marked a new low with
his promise for rent controls,"" says the Adam Smith Insitute. Head of research Ben Southwood adds: ""Rent controls will lead to smaller properties, shoddier upkeep, and long waiting lists to get a flat. What's more, it risks cronyism if councils get a role in deciding who jumps to the front of the queue. ""It may come as no surprise that the Adam Smith Institute disagrees with hardline socialist Jeremy Corbyn - but rent control is a rare case where economists almost all agree, left and right. 95% of top economists agreed rent controls in San Francisco and New York had worsened the amount and quality of affordable rental quality there. ""And you can see why: prospective tenants in rent-controlled Stockholm languish on waiting lists for 15 years on average. Expensive is one thing, but impossible is quite another."" Â© 2025 BBC.

"Three million savers in defined benefit pension schemes only have a 50/50 chance of receiving the payouts they were promised, a study has concluded. Some employers were under pressure to meet their pension obligations, the Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association (PLSA) said. High-profile cases such as the BHS collapse have highlighted concerns over the future of workplace pensions. The PLSA said one solution could be the pooling of resources into ""superfunds"". This would allow companies to pay a fee to transfer defined benefit schemes, such as final-salary pensions, to a larger fund - which would then have bigger investment opportunities. A standard deal for pension scheme members could see some receive better final payouts as a result, but others could see their expected income deteriorate. But pensions consultant John Ralfe described the superfund plan as ""outrageous"". He said there was ""no crisis in defined benefit pensions, so there is no need for crisis measures"" owing to a well-funded lifeboat system for collapsed schemes. ""The PSLA is trying to undermine all the safeguards put in place for members since the 2004 Pensions Act. It wants to turn the clock back to the days when companies could walk away from their pensions without fully funding them,"" he said. Can the UK afford the state pension? Sir Philip Green strikes BHS pension deal with regulator The in-depth study by the PLSA, the trade body for the industry, considered the outlook for defined benefit, including final-salary, pensions used by 11 million people in the UK. Defined benefit schemes promise savers a certain level of income when they retire, rather than relying on the success of investments. Employers have pumped in an extra Â£120bn in special payments to try to plug financial holes in these schemes, but the combined deficit of the UK's 6,000 schemes remains at Â£400bn. The majority of final-salary schemes had a sustainable model for meeting future payouts, the PLSA said. However, three million members of schemes faced a more uncertain financial future, it concluded. Ashok Gupta, who chaired the PLSA review, said there was a ""real possibility"" of a collapse for more high-profile pension schemes, and so the report's many proposals needed to be considered. ""The industry and government need to grasp this opportunity and tackle serious flaws that threaten the security of people's retirement,"" he said. A spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions said: ""Most pension schemes are operating well and the vast majority of members can expect to receive their benefits in full. But in the wake of several high profile cases, there may be more that needs to be done to support the sector. ""As we look at options such as the consolidation of pension schemes, we will continue to work with the industry, employers and scheme members to see what more can be done to increase confidence in defined benefit pensions."" Pension saving has become automatic for most workers, owing to the government's automatic enrolment scheme, but there are still concerns about a lack of saving across all age groups. Insurer Aviva estimated that two million older workers had dependent children or parents, and a third expected to delay retirement with others likely to reduce pension saving owing to the financial pressures involved. ""Many over-50s are shouldering the responsibility of putting their families' financial needs ahead of their own for a prolonged period of time,"" said Lindsey Rix, of Aviva. Aviva's survey did find that many older workers were staying on in employment owing to job satisfaction rather than financial need.

"Rebecca Smith will be in Cambridge's biggest intake of state school pupils since the early 1980s Rebecca Smith will begin life as a student this weekend - the first person in her family to go to university. She'll be starting at Cambridge - and will be part of an intake that has the highest proportion of state school students for 35 years. Along with the boxes and books she'll be taking, she's aware that such institutions have their own baggage. ""People see the buildings and it's very Harry Potter-esque, so they might think it's very snobby,"" she says. But Cambridge's latest admissions figures, shown to the BBC, will reveal that more than 63% of new students are state-educated - the highest since at least 1982. National comparisons across other universities have yet to be published - but compared with last year's figures, this would barely get Cambridge into a top 10 of the most privately educated. ""You shouldn't let where you've come from put you off,"" she said, a few days before taking up her place at Peterhouse, Cambridge's oldest college. She describes her approach to applying as ""nothing to lose, everything to gain"". The 18-year-old, from Cannock in Staffordshire, says she hadn't really thought about going to Cambridge until she began volunteering at an art gallery and met someone who had studied there. John Severn had been at a school in special measures and is about to study maths at Cambridge She applied to study history of art - on the principle of ""just go for it and see what happens"" - with support from her teachers at Cardinal Griffin Catholic High School. And her contact with the university didn't reveal any ""snobbishness"". Rather than finding the interview intimidating, she really enjoyed being able to talk with people who had similar enthusiasms. Now she's about to start a new life, for herself and for her family. ""My parents are going through it all with me,"" she said. Also heading to Cambridge this weekend will be John Severn from Alfreton in Derbyshire. In terms of an educational trajectory, a couple of years ago he was taking his GCSEs in a school in special measures. This video can not be played ""I had no idea what Oxbridge was...the option was just never in my grasp,"" Zareen, who is going to study at Cambridge, tells Radio 4's the World at One. He changed school for sixth form and is now going to be the first person in his immediate family to go to university, after getting four A* grades at A-level. Making contact with the university through open days was an important starting point, he said. ""There is a massive preconception about everyone there being basically posh,"" said John, who is about to start studying maths at Christ's College. But he believes it's about hard work rather than background - and from his experience of the application process, ""they're not bothered where you've been"". Nonetheless, stereotypes die hard. ""Everyone assumes that I'm going to start rowing,"" he says. Despite its rise in the proportion of state school pupils, Cambridge still falls considerably below the average across UK universities, which last year stood at almost 90%. Although last year, universities such as Oxford, Bristol, Durham and St Andrews had even lower proportions of state pupils. Cambridge's latest recruits will be arriving this weekend Sam Lucy, director of admissions for Cambridge, said the university's intake was becoming more representative of those getting top grades at A-level. There are more state school students entering than since at least 1982 - and possibly several years before that, but the admissions office says comparisons before that become unreliable. Dr Lucy attributed the increase to a great deal of outreach work, contacting schools and making links with would-be students. She said there was still work to be done in demystifying the application process and making would-be applicants recognise that academic excellence was not the same thing as being socially exclusive.

"The man thought to have a gun was believed to have approached another man inside Childsplay Nursery Officers are searching for a man who walked into a Liverpool nursery carrying what appeared to be a gun. The man went into Childsplay Nursery in Heathfield Road, Wavertree, shortly after 08:10 BST. Police said he approached a man in the nursery before fleeing on a motorbike with a second man. No-one is reported to have been injured and there was ""no suggestion a firearm was discharged"", Merseyside Police said. Det Ch Insp John Webster said he believed what happened was ""targeted"" and the two wanted men had been ""looking for a man who was in the nursery at the time who was not a member of staff"". Police have stepped up patrols in the area and are conducting a forensic examination He added: ""I'm sure the vast majority of people in the community will be appalled to find that two men have walked into a nursery reportedly carrying a firearm when children and their parents were arriving at the start of the day"". Merseyside Police said officers remained at the nursery and a forensic examination was taking place. Police are also making house-to-house inquiries and have appealed for witnesses or anyone with information to contact them. Local councillor Andrew Makinson said: ""In an area like this it's very unusual, and for it to happen in a nursery, it's utterly shocking for the local community. ""I'm sure the nursery will be reviewing its security, as will other nurseries across the city.

The paper quoted the Hamilton County coroner as saying Mr Warmbier's teeth were ""natural and in good repair"" and that he appeared to have died from brain damage caused by a lack of oxygen. US President Donald Trump, who is known to watch Fox and Friends, tweeted that it had been ""a great interview"", and that ""Otto was tortured beyond belief by North Korea"". His comment is likely to stokethe escalating tensionsbetween North Korea and the US, which have exchanged allegations and threats at an unprecedented rate in recent weeks. The leaders of both countries have directly threatened the other with nuclear annihilation. The international community is appealing for all incendiary rhetoric to be toned down.

"This video can not be played About 1,000 jobs in Belfast are linked to the C-Series Boeing's trade dispute with Bombardier ""could jeopardise"" its defence contracts with the UK government, the UK's defence secretary has warned. Sir Michael Fallon made the comments after the US opted to impose a tax on the C-Series jet made by Bombardier. The proposed 220% import tariff could threaten Bombardier jobs in Belfast. Rival Boeing had complained that Bombardier had received unfair state subsidies from the UK and Canada. It claimed these subsidies helped the firm win a major order. In 2016,Boeing won a contract to supply 50 Apache helicopters,externalto the Army. Reaction to Bombardier tax ruling Analysis: Not the end of Bombardier row Why is company so important to NI? Bombardier-Boeing dispute explained Prime Minister Theresa May has said the UK's long-term partnership with Boeing was being undermined by its behaviour towards Bombardier. Mrs May said Boeing's behaviour was no way to operate in terms of such a long-term partnership. Theresa May said she was bitterly disappointed by the US ruling She said the preliminary judgement over Bombardier would cause uncertainty and that the government was doing everything it could to protect jobs in Northern Ireland. The prime minister said she had spoken to DUP leader Arlene Foster and Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill, and would be working with them both. Mrs May said she had spoken to US President Donald Trump ""more than once"" about the issue, as well as raising it during their recent meeting at the United Nations General Assembly in New York. Meanwhile, Bombardier said it would fight the ""absurd"" ruling. The firm is one of Northern Ireland's biggest employers. Sir Michael said during a visit to Belfast that ""Boeing stands to gain from British defence spending"" but that ""this kind of behaviour could jeopardise our future relationship"" with the firm. The proposed tariff could threaten jobs at Bombardier in Belfast ""We don't want to do that. Boeing is an important investor in the United Kingdom; an important employer in the United Kingdom. ""But we would prefer this kind of dispute to be settled on a negotiated basis and we will be redoubling our efforts with the Canadian government to bring about a negotiated settlement."" The UK government and trade unions fear the imposition of tariffs could make the Canadian firm question whether to remain in Northern Ireland, where it employs 4,100 of its 28,000-strong workforce. The ruling damaged the global aerospace industry and was ""frankly not what we would expect of a long-term partner to the UK"", said a UK government spokesman, while emphasising this was just the first step in a lengthy process. About 1,000 jobs are linked to the C-Series, the wings of which are made at a purpose-built Â£520m factory at Queen's Island in Belfast. Boeing said the dispute was about ""maintaining a level playing field"" The programme is not just important to Bombardier jobs in Belfast, but also to 15 smaller aerospace firms in Northern Ireland - and dozens more across the UK - which make components for the wings. The US Department of Commerce ruling, which could triple the cost of a C-Series aircraft sold into the United States, could potentially jeopardise a major order placed last year from US airline Delta - a $5.6bn (Â£4.15bn) deal for up to 125 of the jets. Bombardier said the decision was ""divorced from the reality about the financing of multibillion-dollar aircraft programmes"". The Canadian firm said Boeing was seeking to use US trade laws ""to stifle competition"". By Julian O'Neill, Northern Ireland business correspondent The outcome was predicted - but not the severity of the penalty. The tariff could triple the cost of C-Series aircraft in the US, effectively killing the market for Bombardier. It also puts a major order with Delta Airlines at risk - and things could get worse before they get better. Washington's Department of Commerce is due to make a second tariff ruling on 5 October. But a more important date is next February when the US International Trade Commission will either uphold the penalty or remove it. This was always the focus for Bombardier and its allies. Bombardier said it had created a ""superior aircraft"" that is more efficient and comfortable but Boeing was trying to prevent ""US passengers from realising these benefits, irrespective of the harm that it would cause to the US aerospace industry and the cost to airlines and consumers"". This video can not be played Sir Jeffrey Donaldson tells Today that Bombardier tariff may have 'devastating' economic consequences But Boeing said the dispute was about ""maintaining a level playing field"", and said its aim was to make sure that ""aerospace companies abide by trade agreements"". Delta, however, said there was no risk to US businesses as neither Boeing nor any other US firm produced 100-110 seat aircraft to compete with the C-Series. US Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross said one reason for the tariff ruling was Bombardier's failure to cooperate with the investigation. Allow Twitter content?

""The evidence we have to rely on is evidence not coming from Bombardier but evidence being proposed by Boeing and other outside parties,"" he said. The US government was ""not necessarily"" targeting Bombardier's Northern Ireland factory, he said, but added: ""If you're building wings for a plane that doesn't get built, that's a problem."" Analysts say that the ruling will increase tensions between the US government and Canada and the UK, both countries have dealsto supply military aircraft,externalworth billions of dollars with Boeing. The UK government and Northern Ireland Executive pledged to invest almost Â£135m in the establishment of the C-Series manufacturing site. The programme received Â£750m from Quebec's provincial government in 2015 when its fortunes appeared to be ailing. Critics say Boeing's complaints are unfounded as it does not make 100-110 seat aircrafts with which the C-Series would compete On Wednesday, Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard called the tariffs ""unfair"" and an attack on the Canadian province where Bombardier has its headquarters and employs more than 17,000 people. ""Quebec has been attacked. And Quebec will resist,""  he told journalists, adding that that Quebec remained committed to manufacturing the C-Series. ""Boeing may have won the battle but the war is far from over,"" he said. In 2016, Quebec invested US$1bn in the passenger jet. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has threatened to cancel the purchase of 18 Boeing Super Hornet jet fighters from the US in retaliation. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau threatened to cancel a Boeing order from the US Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland said on Tuesday that the government was disappointed in the decision. The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers - a machinists union - called the countervailing duty ""a protectionist and dangerous measure for the stability of the aerospace industry"". In Northern Ireland, CBI director Angela McGowan said the ruling put an important driver of Northern Ireland's economic growth at risk. Northern Ireland has effectively been without a devolved government for nine months, and Ms McGowan said the situation reinforced the need for a return of a power-sharing executive. ""With jobs and future prosperity in the region being put at risk by decisions made far away from Belfast, we need a devolved government that can speak up for and champion the needs of the local workers and businesses most affected,"" she said.

"This video can not be played Video from scene of Portbury Hundred incident A man has died in a shooting involving armed police at a junction of the M5 motorway near Bristol. Officers fired shots at a car on the Portbury Hundred (A369) near junction 19 for Portishead at about 09:30 BST, an eyewitness told the BBC. Avon and Somerset Police said it acted following reports of a man in a car with a handgun. The Independent Police Complaints Commission said there were reports ""he had threatened another motorist"". Latest updates from the scene Bullet holes can be seen in the rear window of the red car Forensic teams are carrying out fingertip searches of the scene A police spokesman said: ""Earlier this morning we received calls from concerned members of the public travelling on the M5 who reported they had seen a man in a car with a handgun. ""The vehicle left the motorway at junction 19 and officers stopped the car on the A369 known as the Portbury Hundred. ""Shots were subsequently fired in an incident involving police firearms and a man has died. ""We referred the incident to the IPCC: they're now on the scene carrying out an independent investigation which we are supporting."" The road will remain closed overnight whilst investigations continue. The force added it was not terror-related. An IPCC spokesman confirmed it had launched an investigation and said its teams have been at the scene gathering evidence. ""We have been advised that officers were responding to reports of a man travelling on the M5 with a handgun and that he had threatened another motorist,"" he said. ""What appears to be a non-police issue firearm was found at the scene and will also be subject to examination."" He added inquiries were continuing to formally identify the deceased and his next of kin. A post mortem is due to take place on Thursday. IPCC Commissioner Cindy Butts: ""At this stage we are currently investigating the circumstances of the incident and no individual police officer is under investigation. ""There would have been a large number of witnesses, given this incident took place on a busy road during rush hour. We would ask that anyone with information that may assist our independent investigation make contact with our investigators."" This video can not be played What appears to be a handgun can be seen on top of the damaged car Forensic officers in white protective suits are scouring every inch of the car and road surface. An object on the roof of the red car looks like a handgun to the naked eye. There are bullet holes in the windows and shards of shattered glass on the tarmac below. The driver's door is open. This afternoon police erected a large privacy barrier across the end of the road and extended the cordon around the scene. A large blue police tent has been carried in and installed next to the car. David Ellison told BBC Radio Bristol he saw officers fire between six and 10 shots through the passenger window using handguns. ""They surrounded it. They shot maybe five, six or 10 times,"" he said. ""Then they dragged a man from the car to resuscitate him. ""It came off the roundabout towards Portishead and then was boxed in by cars."" Lisa Fussell told the BBC she had been driving along the Portbury Hundred when she came across a scene of ""chaos"" involving two unmarked police cars and ""five or six officers dressed all in black"". ""The air ambulance landed in front of us. The medics got out and ran to a red car. It looked like someone had been taken ill,"" she said. ""It frightened us and it's upsetting now that we know he's been killed. He was someone's son."" The Great Western Air Ambulance's critical care team also attended.

"Carew Cricket Club posed for this picture after winning the Pembrokeshire League title A cricket club at the centre of a fair play row in a Welsh league has been relegated by a disciplinary committee. Carew declared after scoring just 18 runs for one wicket against title rivals Cresselly in the final match of the Pembrokeshire league season. The declarationmeant their opponentscould not win the league as they could not pick up enough bonus points and Carew went on to be crowned champions. Carew remain champions but will consider an appeal against relegation. 'Unfair' Carew Cricket Club match investigated after row Pembroke champions Carew face disrepute charge Pembrokeshire cricket club denied by local rivals A disciplinary group was set up by Pembroke County Cricket Club (PCCC), which runs the game locally and launched the investigation following complaints. Carew started the day 21 points clear and with 20 points for a win, declared on 18-1 to deny Cresselly the chance of any batting or bowling bonus points so Carew won the title. Officials said Carew did not technically break any rules, but the complaints led to the creation of a four-man disciplinary committee which looked into the team's actions. It decided to relegate Carew to Division Two but allowed them to remain as champions. The team's captain has also been told he is banned from starting the 2018 season, and the club was also fined Â£300. The club's appeal will be heard by the PCCC in the next few weeks.

"A French property scheme is a ""slow-burning catastrophe"" for British investors who are trapped in costly contracts, an MEP has said. The leaseback schemes were aimed at encouraging people to buy properties in tourist areas, then rent them out. It was supposed to offer the owners a guaranteed return, but many say they are trapped in costly contracts with management companies. MEP Daniel Dalton says the French government should help these people. French leaseback schemes were first introduced in the 1980s as a way to increase investment in tourist destinations. They were heavily marketed in the UK and Ireland in the mid-2000s as a risk-free investment. Buyers were offered tax breaks if they signed long-term deals, typically nine years, with management companies to let the properties out to tourists. The owners were meant to be paid a guaranteed amount of money raised from this rent, but this was often not the case. Further problems come when people try to cancel the management deal at the end of the contract - one woman said she was faced with a bill off 22,000 euros (Â£19,290). This bill is compensation the management company can ask for under French commercial law to cover the loss of earnings they say they will suffer as a consequence of the contract being ended. Pauline Hitchcock and husband Mick bought a French leaseback property near the coast in 2005. She had inherited some money, and the property was in an area that the family had camped in when their children were young. She saw the system as a way to buy a holiday home that otherwise seemed financially out of reach. ""It wasn't to make profits. It was so that it covered its running costs and it gave us holidays every year,"" she says. At the end of the nine-year management contract she was keen to end her relationship with the leaseback companies. ""We were told we have to pay in the region of 22,000 euros. It doesn't make sense. We do not have 22,000 euros."" Pauline says she had no idea she could be liable for compensation. ""We made sure when we were buying the villa that we had crossed every 't' and dotted every 'i'. We had gone through the contract not only with our notaire [legal representative], but we had gone independently to another lawyer that dealt with French law."" She is one of the investors who is now seeking legal action. There are no comprehensive figures for the number of people having problems with the scheme. Around 2,000 people, mainly from the UK and Ireland, signed a petition calling for help from the EU in dealing with the problems around French leaseback schemes. Mr Dalton has heard from dozens of people in similar situations. ""In one case, someone actually had to sell their house in the UK. Many people have bought these houses as investments, they've been marketed to them as risk-free investments. They're certainly not risk-free investments. And the problem is they can't get out of the scheme,"" he said. Daniel Dalton MEP has been campaigning within the European Parliament for more protection for consumers Mr Dalton has been campaigning within the European Parliament for more protection for consumers. He thinks some of the contracts could be illegal under EU law, particularly under the mis-selling of properties directive. He has asked the UK Competition and Markets Authority to investigate the issue. They have now contacted their French counterpart, which he hopes will start moving the process forward. A man who spoke to the Victoria Derbyshire programme on condition of anonymity, who sold leaseback schemes in the mid-2000s, says that many of the brokers selling the schemes in the UK at that time didn't understand French law well enough to advise prospective buyers properly. He stopped selling new properties when his own clients started reporting problems with management companies. Guillaume Barlet-Batada, an expert in French property law for London-based firm Cubism Law, says there are ways for leaseback owners to get out of their contracts, but it's not easy and can be expensive. ""There are various ways to get out. Some co-owners have gathered and tried to do that themselves. From what I've seen it seemed to be successful. Liberating for some but it's a heavy price on time because you have to be prepared to deal with it yourself,"" he said. French leaseback deals are still available online now, but there is more consumer protection because of a change in the law introduced for buyers after 2009. The BBC contacted the French government for comment but did not receive a reply. Watch theVictoria Derbyshire programmeon weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News channel.

"This video can not be played Why Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico so hard US President Donald Trump has defended his response to the disaster in Puerto Rico, which has been ravaged by Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Maria. Much of the US island territory has lost power, while residents say they are running low on medicines and food. Critics have accused Mr Trump of being slow to respond, and of showing more concern for Texas and Florida after they were hit by hurricanes. Mr Trump has announced he will visit Puerto Rico next week. ""That island was hit as hard as you can hit,"" he said, adding the US was sending food, water and supplies on ""an hourly basis"" to the island. Hurricane Maria battered Puerto Rico last Wednesday, killing 16 people and knocking out electricity, water and telephone services. It tore through the island as one of the most powerful storms in nearly 90 years. Does Trump care about Puerto Rico? 'Will my dad get his cancer treatment?' How is Puerto Rico related to the US? About 44% of the 3.5 million residents living on the island are still without clean drinking water six days after the storm barrelled through, the Defence Department said on Tuesday. The mayor of San Juan, Puerto Rico's capital, told the BBC the island was ""in a humanitarian crisis"". ""Our hospitals have no diesel. And of course no diesel means no life support systems,"" Carmen Yulin Cruz said. ""People that are dependent on diesel in order to breathe are running out of diesel or their batteries are running out. So they're really fighting life or death situations."" Gerardo Torres, a doctor in San Juan, told the BBC that ""operating rooms are closed due to lack of air conditioning and operating kits cannot be sterilised"". Nearly half of the US island territory lacks clean drinking water Meanwhile, resident Christina Cabrero told the BBC she was unable to reach her father's doctors to discuss his cancer treatment because phone lines had been destroyed. The island's government has asked a judge to defer key deadlines in its bankruptcy case as it grapples with Maria's devastation. Mr Trump came under fire after he spent the weekend focusing on a feud with NFL players and coaches, instead of acknowledging the Puerto Rico disaster. He tweeted about the crisis on Monday - but angered critics by suggesting that the island's $72bn (Â£53bn) debt needed to be addressed amid its appeal for relief aid. Allow Twitter content?

On Tuesday, the White House announced that Mr Trump had increased federal funding and assistance for debris removal and emergency protective measures in Puerto Rico in the aftermath of the storm. Mr Trump said he would visit the territory next Tuesday - nearly a fortnight after the storm struck - because it was the ""earliest I can go without disrupting relief efforts"". He may also visit the US Virgin Islands, which was hit by both Hurricane Maria and Irma. This video can not be played Trump 'never seen anything like Puerto Rico' Mr Trump said his administration was doing a ""really good job"" and that the Governor of Puerto Rico, Ricardo Rossello, was ""so grateful"". He said rescue efforts were complicated because Puerto Rico was offshore. ""This is a thing called the Atlantic ocean, this is tough stuff,"" he said. He added: ""Puerto Rico is very important to me. The people are fantastic. I grew up in New York so I know many Puerto Rican people."" Mr Rossello told Reuters Mr Trump's handling of the disaster had been ""excellent"" and that the government had ""responded very quickly"" to the crisis. More than 10,000 US Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) staff are on the ground in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands to assist with relief efforts, according to the agency.

"Roy Moore's victory is likely to send shockwaves through Washington US President Donald Trump's pick for Alabama's Senate race has lost the state's Republican primary to a firebrand Christian conservative. Incumbent Luther Strange, 64, said he had called rival Roy Moore to concede the race. ""We wish him the best as he goes forward,"" he told supporters. Mr Moore is a populist former chief justice in the state, who rode to the voting booth on a horse named Sassy, and brandished a gun at a rally. The news is likely to rattle Washington Republicans, including President Trump, who had confidently pitted Mr Strange against the party's anti-establishment wing. Alabama election pits Trump against his base Trump turns on Republican leadership Mr Trump and Vice-President Mike Pence have both appeared with Mr Strange at rallies, while a political group linked to top Senate Republican Mitch McConnell is said to have spent nearly $9m (Â£6.7m) on his behalf. The president himself flew in to Alabama to offer his endorsement to Mr Strange Vice-President Mike Pence (R) campaigned for the incumbent senator just days before his poll defeat The Senate seat was held by Jeff Sessions until February, when Mr Trump picked him to serve as US attorney general. The president made his allegiance clear on 24 September, tweeting: ""It was great being with Luther Strange last night in Alabama. What great people, what a crowd! Vote Luther on Tuesday."" But within minutes of the result, he had thrown his weight behind the winning Republican candidate. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Moore, 70, is best known for losing his position as the state's top judge twice. The first time, he had flouted a court order to remove a Ten Commandments monument from the courthouse. When the people of Alabama elected him to the court again, he wassuspended a second timefor defying the US Supreme Court's 2015 ruling legalising gay marriage. Alabama has not elected a Democrat to the Senate in a quarter of a century, so Mr Moore is expected to beat his Democratic rival Doug Jones when they face off in a vote on 12 December. Mr Moore had threatened to upend the Republican Party if he won the nomination and branded his opponent an ""establishment lackey"". This video can not be played Meet the outsider who made Trump eat his words The bible-quoting evangelical drew support from Christian conservative Sarah Palin - and recently-fired White House chief strategist Steve Bannon. Mr Bannon, the architect of President Trump's ""America First"" agenda, said on Monday that Republican elites think Alabama voters are just ""a pack of morons"" who will vote as they are instructed to. ""You're going to see in state after state people that follow the model of Judge Roy Moore, that do not need to raise money from the elites,"" he declared at Mr Moore's victory party. Mr Moore said of the vote: ""God has put me in this election at this time, and all the nation is watching."" Though voters rejected his candidate of choice, President Trump remains popular in Alabama, which he won by 28 points last year. The new Republican nominee insists he is among the president's fans. ""Don't let anybody in the press think that because he supported my opponent I do not support him and support his agenda,"" Mr Moore said after winning. By Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter On Friday night, Mr Trump expressed his doubts about whether he was doing the right thing by coming down to Alabama to push for Mr Strange. He said he ""might have made a mistake"" and fretted that if Mr Strange were to lose on Tuesday, the media would say the president had failed to ""pull his candidate across the line"". If the president was a bit concerned, however, others in Washington are downright scared. Mr Moore's success raises the possibility that while Republican Party loyalists have sought a means to work with the president, the forces that swept him to power could be beyond even Mr Trump's control.

"This video can not be played About 1,000 jobs in Belfast are linked to the C-Series Boeing's trade dispute with Bombardier ""could jeopardise"" its defence contracts with the UK government, the UK's defence secretary has warned. Sir Michael Fallon made the comments after the US opted to impose a tax on the C-Series jet made by Bombardier. The proposed 220% import tariff could threaten Bombardier jobs in Belfast. Rival Boeing had complained that Bombardier had received unfair state subsidies from the UK and Canada. It claimed these subsidies helped the firm win a major order. In 2016,Boeing won a contract to supply 50 Apache helicopters,externalto the Army. Reaction to Bombardier tax ruling Analysis: Not the end of Bombardier row Why is company so important to NI? Bombardier-Boeing dispute explained Prime Minister Theresa May has said the UK's long-term partnership with Boeing was being undermined by its behaviour towards Bombardier. Mrs May said Boeing's behaviour was no way to operate in terms of such a long-term partnership. Theresa May said she was bitterly disappointed by the US ruling She said the preliminary judgement over Bombardier would cause uncertainty and that the government was doing everything it could to protect jobs in Northern Ireland. The prime minister said she had spoken to DUP leader Arlene Foster and Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill, and would be working with them both. Mrs May said she had spoken to US President Donald Trump ""more than once"" about the issue, as well as raising it during their recent meeting at the United Nations General Assembly in New York. Meanwhile, Bombardier said it would fight the ""absurd"" ruling. The firm is one of Northern Ireland's biggest employers. Sir Michael said during a visit to Belfast that ""Boeing stands to gain from British defence spending"" but that ""this kind of behaviour could jeopardise our future relationship"" with the firm. The proposed tariff could threaten jobs at Bombardier in Belfast ""We don't want to do that. Boeing is an important investor in the United Kingdom; an important employer in the United Kingdom. ""But we would prefer this kind of dispute to be settled on a negotiated basis and we will be redoubling our efforts with the Canadian government to bring about a negotiated settlement."" The UK government and trade unions fear the imposition of tariffs could make the Canadian firm question whether to remain in Northern Ireland, where it employs 4,100 of its 28,000-strong workforce. The ruling damaged the global aerospace industry and was ""frankly not what we would expect of a long-term partner to the UK"", said a UK government spokesman, while emphasising this was just the first step in a lengthy process. About 1,000 jobs are linked to the C-Series, the wings of which are made at a purpose-built Â£520m factory at Queen's Island in Belfast. Boeing said the dispute was about ""maintaining a level playing field"" The programme is not just important to Bombardier jobs in Belfast, but also to 15 smaller aerospace firms in Northern Ireland - and dozens more across the UK - which make components for the wings. The US Department of Commerce ruling, which could triple the cost of a C-Series aircraft sold into the United States, could potentially jeopardise a major order placed last year from US airline Delta - a $5.6bn (Â£4.15bn) deal for up to 125 of the jets. Bombardier said the decision was ""divorced from the reality about the financing of multibillion-dollar aircraft programmes"". The Canadian firm said Boeing was seeking to use US trade laws ""to stifle competition"". By Julian O'Neill, Northern Ireland business correspondent The outcome was predicted - but not the severity of the penalty. The tariff could triple the cost of C-Series aircraft in the US, effectively killing the market for Bombardier. It also puts a major order with Delta Airlines at risk - and things could get worse before they get better. Washington's Department of Commerce is due to make a second tariff ruling on 5 October. But a more important date is next February when the US International Trade Commission will either uphold the penalty or remove it. This was always the focus for Bombardier and its allies. Bombardier said it had created a ""superior aircraft"" that is more efficient and comfortable but Boeing was trying to prevent ""US passengers from realising these benefits, irrespective of the harm that it would cause to the US aerospace industry and the cost to airlines and consumers"". This video can not be played Sir Jeffrey Donaldson tells Today that Bombardier tariff may have 'devastating' economic consequences But Boeing said the dispute was about ""maintaining a level playing field"", and said its aim was to make sure that ""aerospace companies abide by trade agreements"". Delta, however, said there was no risk to US businesses as neither Boeing nor any other US firm produced 100-110 seat aircraft to compete with the C-Series. US Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross said one reason for the tariff ruling was Bombardier's failure to cooperate with the investigation. Allow Twitter content?

The UK government and Northern Ireland Executive pledged to invest almost Â£135m in the establishment of the C-Series manufacturing site.

Critics say Boeing's complaints are unfounded as it does not make 100-110 seat aircrafts with which the C-Series would compete On Wednesday, Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard called the tariffs ""unfair"" and an attack on the Canadian province where Bombardier has its headquarters and employs more than 17,000 people. ""Quebec has been attacked. And Quebec will resist,""  he told journalists, adding that that Quebec remained committed to manufacturing the C-Series. ""Boeing may have won the battle but the war is far from over,"" he said. In 2016, Quebec invested US$1bn in the passenger jet. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has threatened to cancel the purchase of 18 Boeing Super Hornet jet fighters from the US in retaliation. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau threatened to cancel a Boeing order from the US Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland said on Tuesday that the government was disappointed in the decision. The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers - a machinists union - called the countervailing duty ""a protectionist and dangerous measure for the stability of the aerospace industry"". In Northern Ireland, CBI director Angela McGowan said the ruling put an important driver of Northern Ireland's economic growth at risk. Northern Ireland has effectively been without a devolved government for nine months, and Ms McGowan said the situation reinforced the need for a return of a power-sharing executive.

"The number of conventional births has dropped from 407,031 in 2011-12 to 382,514 in 2015-16 Rising obesity and older mothers are behind thousands of extra Caesarean births, experts have said. Maternity figures show the numbers of both elected and emergency Caesarean sections have gone up despite a fall in the overall number of births. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists said the figures reflect an increase in ""complex births"", with obesity and age the main reasons. The Royal College of Midwives said the rise in Caesareans was ""a worry"". More than a quarter of all babies born in England are now delivered that way. Live from a maternity ward: Follow our updates for 24 hours There were 73,551 elective - or planned - C-sections on the NHS in 2015-16, which was about 6,750 more than in 2011-12. There was also a small rise in the number of emergency Caesarean births - up from 97,054 in 2011-12 to 99,403 in 2015-16. This video can not be played Caesarean sections: Why and when are they used? Caesarean section - or C-section - is when a baby is delivered by making a surgical cut in to the abdomen and womb. C-sections fall into two categories. The first are called elective, or planned, C-sections. These are planned in advance, usually for medical reasons, such as a baby that is either in the wrong position or very large. The second are emergency Caesareans, which are usually carried out because of complications during labour. Overall, the number of conventional births has dropped from 407,031 in 2011-12 to 382,514 in 2015-16. According to the Office of National Statistics,the average age of mothers has increasedby four years in the past 40 years and in 2015more than a fifth of all live births,externalin England and Wales were to mothers aged over 35. Forty years earlier it was a little over one in 20. A study by the Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries found about40,000 maternities each year,externalin the UK involve women who are clinically obese. Dr Pat O'Brien, a consultant obstetrician and spokesman for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said: ""In recent years, there has been a higher number of complex births due to older maternal age and obesity and these are both associated with a number of complications, including a greater risk of miscarriage, stillbirth and a more complicated labour."" He stressed that most ""elective"" Caesareans were performed for clinical reasons, rather than because it was what the mother had chosen. Alexandra Borrett with baby Lucy and partner Andrew A Caesarean section was not an easier alternative to a conventional birth for Alexandra Borrett It brought discomfort and even hallucinations after Lucy was delivered. Aged 32 and a keen runner, she was neither older nor overweight for a pregnant mother and had barely considered what a C-section involved. Miss Borrett wanted a water birth at the midwife-led (now closed) Harwich Maternity Hospital but her contractions slowed, her waters did not break and there were concerns about her baby's heartbeat. Cutting Lucy out took seconds. So quick, said Miss Borrett, that she did not immediately realise her baby had been born because there was no cry. Lucy, she learned, was not breathing and Miss Borrett feared the worst. Lucy was not breathing but was quickly resuscitated Lucy was taken away and successfully resuscitated. Miss Borrett, who describes the aftermath as a significant discomfort and of feeling ""very swollen"", was given heavy painkillers which triggered hallucinations. ""I woke up in the middle of the night in the ward, I grabbed my baby and ran off down a corridor shouting that the hospital was on fire,"" she said. She did not leave her house for 17 days afterwards because of the pain and even 13 months on, her scarring feels ""tight"". And she described how she initially felt as though she had ""failed"" by not giving birth naturally, but has since decided it was the right thing for her baby. Although she found talking through her experience with the consultant three months after Lucy was born helpful, she said there was very little support for mothers who have to have an emergency C-section. Miss Borrett, meanwhile, has recently completed a 10km running race and has ""never been fitter"". A spokesman for the Royal College of Midwives said: ""The continued rise in Caesarean sections is a worry. ""Whilst some are needed for medical reasons we need to know why the rate is increasing, and take steps to address this. ""This issue is also linked to the rising numbers of overweight and obese pregnant women and I remain concerned about the increase in these numbers. ""These women are more likely to have a Caesarean section, and may also need additional support and care because of the potential complications that can occur in pregnancy for these women."" The number of births involving medical equipment, such as forceps or a ventouse, has dropped from more than 85,000 in 2011-12 to 82,204 in 2015-16. Establishing which hospitals have seen the largest increases in elected Caesareans is difficult because of recent mergers. So while both King's College Hospital with an apparent 665% increase and Barts Health with a 254% increase might appear to have the biggest rises, they have also absorbed two other hospitals each in the past five years, meaning the total number of births they manage have increased by similar amounts. Queen Elizabeth Hospital (QEH) in Kings Lynn saw an increase in elective C-sections but a fall in the overall number of births over four years. In 2011-12, 148 mothers had elected Caesareans out of 2,332 births. By 2015-16, that number was 255 out of 2,300 births. The hospital's chief nurse Emma Hardwick said: ""Over the last five years, the QEH has seen a rise in the percentage of mothers having caesarean sections. There are a number of reasons for this increase at the trust, these include obese mothers, IVF, older mothers and changes in guidelines. ""At the QEH there have been many highly welcomed initiatives for mothers and their babies in recent years to support lowering the Caesarean section rate and give women more choice, for example homebirth and the opening of the midwifery-led unit.""
