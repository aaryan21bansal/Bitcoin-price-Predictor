"Matt Hancock was pictured leaving Downing Street with Gina Coladangelo on 1 May Health Secretary Matt Hancock has admitted breaking social distancing guidance after pictures of him kissing an aide were published in a newspaper. He said he had ""let people down"" after photos emerged of him with Gina Coladangelo - whom he appointed - and he was ""very sorry"". Labour urged the PM to sack Mr Hancock, calling his position ""untenable"". But Downing Street said Boris Johnson accepted Mr Hancock's apology and considered the matter closed. A spokesman added that the prime minister had full confidence in the health secretary. The Sun reported that its pictures of Mr Hancock and Ms Coladangelo, who are both married with three children, had been taken inside the Department of Health on 6 May. How did Matt Hancock break Covid restrictions? Matt Hancock: A high profile health secretary Queen describes health secretary as 'poor man' Social distancing at work is not a legal requirement, but the government recommends that peoplekeep 2m apart,externalwhere possible - or 1m with ""risk mitigation"", such as standing side-by-side or wearing masks. Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said his cabinet colleague was ""right to apologise"", telling BBC Radio's 4 Any Questions programme: ""There's a task to be done. Matt is on the job doing that, and I think we should allow him to get on with the job."" He added: ""The rules have been hard. It is everybody's duty to follow the rules, but equally I've not been somebody who has criticised and condemned people when they've made mistakes."" This video can not be played Labour's Anneliese Dodds on Matt Hancock: The prime minister needs to act Labour's Emily Thornberry, the shadow international trade secretary, told the same programme that Mr Hancock's actions showed ""an arrogance that they believe they're above the law"", adding that ""he should have gone a long time ago"". ""What we're talking about is somebody breaking the rules for which they were personally responsible - where they were on television night after night telling us that we weren't allowed to have intimate contact with people from outside our households,"" she said. And a Labour spokesperson said the matter was ""definitely not closed, despite the government's attempts to cover it up"". The government believes no laws were broken because Mr Hancock and Ms Coladangelo were both in the department for legitimate work purposes, sources say. The Liberal Democrats called on Mr Hancock to resign and accused him of ""hypocrisy"" over social distancing. Boris Johnson doesn't do ministerial resignations. He resists calls from the opposition, the media - and even his own colleagues. His then aide Dominic Cummings wasn't sacked last spring for his 260-mile trip to Durham during lockdown. Unlike with Mr Cummings, there has been no cacophonous clamour from Mr Hancock's Conservative colleagues for him to go straight away. But there are concerns that he won't have credibility in the Commons or in the country to argue that the existing restrictions should be respected. And in retaining Mr Hancock in office, Boris Johnson has enabled political opponents to revive an attack which they believe has resonance with voters: that there is one rule for ministers - and another for everyone else. The Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group said it was ""heartbreaking"" that Mr Hancock had been ""ignoring the rules while we were unable to hug friends and family at our loved ones' funerals"". The group wrote to the prime minister, saying that if the health secretary was ""unable to find the decency to do the right thing and resign his position, it is paramount that you relieve him from it"". In a statement, Mr Hancock, 42, said: ""I accept that I breached the social distancing guidance in these circumstances. I have let people down and am very sorry. ""I remain focused on working to get the country out of this pandemic, and would be grateful for privacy for my family on this personal matter."" The Metropolitan Police said it was not investigating Mr Hancock over alleged breaches of Covid regulations as it did not look into Covid-related issues retrospectively ""as a matter of course"". The force added it was aware of the images alleged to have been obtained within official government premises but ""at this time this remains a matter for the relevant government department"". Ms Coladangelo, a friend of the health secretary since they worked on a student radio station at Oxford University, was made a non-executive director of the Department of Health last September. The role comes with a Â£15,000 salary and involves 15 to 20 days of work per year. Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner has written to the cabinet secretary - the UK's most senior civil servant - asking him to investigate whether Mr Hancock broke ministerial rules by failing to ""declare that he was engaged in a relationship with someone whom he personally appointed at taxpayers' expense"". A government spokesman said Ms Coladangelo's appointment had been ""made in the usual way"" and had ""followed correct procedure"". The Times has reported that Mr Hancock failed to declare their friendship when appointing Ms Coladangelo - who is also communications director for fashion retailer Oliver Bonas - as an adviser in March last year. She held the role for six months, before she was appointed to the Department of Health's non-executive board. In May last year, epidemiologist Prof Neil Ferguson resigned from the government's scientific advisory group (Sage) after it emerged he had broken lockdown rules when a woman he was reportedly in a relationship with visited his home. At the time Mr Hancockcalled these actions ""extraordinary"",adding that social distancing rules were ""there for everyone"" and ""deadly serious"". On Friday, Labour's First Minister of Wales, Mark Drakeford, said Mr Hancock had been ""quick to condemn"", adding: ""We can't make laws for other people and not be willing to abide by them yourself."" But Mr Hancock's colleagues rallied around him, with International Trade Secretary Liz Truss telling the BBC: ""[Mr Hancock] does have my support."" Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said there was ""a complete difference between what people do in their job... and what they do in their personal lives"". However, Conservative backbench MP Andrew Bridgen said that if the health secretary felt that the revelations over Ms Coladangelo had ""affected his performance of his role"" he should consider his position. Mr Hancock has been married for 15 years to Martha, who is an osteopath. Ms Coladangelo, 43, is married to Oliver Bonas founder Oliver Tress.

"Bede Mullen (l) and Mark Murray (r) were both abused at the college Men who were sexually abused as boys at a training school for Roman Catholic priests have welcomed a bishop's ""momentous"" apology. The group were pupils at St Peter Claver College in Mirfield, West Yorkshire, when they were molested in the 1960s and 70s. At a meeting with the men, the Bishop of Leeds said their abusers were people they should have been able to trust. One victim said the apology marked a changing attitude from the church. St Peter Claver was a seminary run by a Roman Catholic mission, The Verona Fathers, now known as the Comboni Order. Former students who experienced sexual abuse at the school said their complaints had been ignored for decades by the church. One victim, Bede Mullen, said the abuse and the way the victims had been treated had a major impact on all of their lives, with the message up until now being: ""Go away and forget it."" ""It's a constant presence, it's always there - the feeling you are not being believed,"" he said. ""Two of our members have died before this apology. Many have suffered fractured lives largely due to their experiences as children,"" he said. Bede Mullen said the abuse had a major impact on the lives of the victims He said the bishop's apology was the first time a senior figure in the church had acknowledged what had happened to them. ""It has been a long journey, it has taken decades. It is a tremendous gesture by the bishop and we are deeply appreciative of it."" Mr Mullen has previously said that boys at the seminary were called from their dormitory at night to visit the priests in their room, often on the pretext of saying prayers together. There were occasions when one priest joined boys in the showers on the pretence of hurrying them up, he said. At a meeting attended remotely by high-ranking church officials, The Bishop of Leeds, the Rt Rev Marcus Stock, said he had spent much time ""praying and reflecting"" on how to express the shame he felt for the victims' abuse and their subsequent treatment. While he accepted the personal apology could be viewed as ""too little, too late"", he offered the men his ""heartfelt apology for the pain and trauma"" they had experienced. ""I wish, therefore, here and now, to apologise to you personally and unreservedly for the childhood sexual abuse you suffered,"" he said. ""Because they have been ignored, because they have not been listened to, and that too is a form of abuse and that is why it was important I had this meeting with them."" He said the Pope was aware the men had not had an ""adequate pastoral response"" from the leadership of the Comboni Order. The Bishop of Leeds, the Rt Rev Marcus Stock, said he offered his ""heartfelt"" apology to the men Another victim, Mark Murray, from St Asaph, Denbighshire, Wales, said the apology was ""a momentous thing"". ""We've never had that. We've always been ignored, really,"" he said. Mr Murray added that the only time the church had previously engaged with the victims was through the courts. ""I think it highlights a change in the Catholic church, where more people are beginning to listen to victims and survivors,"" he said. Mark Murray said the bishop's apology was the first time the church had acknowledged what had happened The meeting was also attended by Cardinal Vincent Nichols, Archbishop of Westminster, and Archbishop Charles Scicluna of Malta, who is Adjunct Secretary of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith - the body responsible for dealing with clerical sexual abuse cases within the Catholic church. Mr Mullen said the men hoped to get a meeting with the Pope and were encouraged by the presence of Archbishop Scicluna. The Comboni Orderpaid compensation in 2014 to 11 menwho said they had been abused at the college, however it has never formally acknowledged the abuse. Mr Murray said he did not think he would trust any apology from the order: ""An apology from the Combonis may be seen as a forced apology and I wouldn't want that. It has to come from the heart."" Meanwhile, Mr Mullen said: ""You can't wait for over a decade for an apology and believe it."" The abuse took place at St Peter Claver College in Mirfield in the 1960s and 70s During the meeting, the Bishop of Leeds acknowledged he had not been successful in arranging a meeting between the victims and the Comboni Order. In a statement issued following the bishop's apology, The Comboni Order said: ""It was with great sadness and regret that we learned about the allegations of non-recent abuse relating to our former junior seminary which closed in 1984. ""We acknowledge the harm caused by child abuse and have publicly apologised for any abuse suffered by former seminarians."" It said it had worked to respond with ""seriousness and sensitivity to the complaints and claims made"" and had co-operated with the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse. It said it condemned any action which caused ""harm or distress"" to others. ""The health, safety and wellbeing of every child remains our absolute priority, and we subscribe to the comprehensive national safeguarding policies and procedures of the Catholic Church in the UK to ensure this is paramount,"" the statement added. West Yorkshire Police investigated reports of historical sexual abuse at the seminary, but said as two of the named suspects were dead, the investigation could go no further. A third suspect is alive, but is in Italy and cannot be extradited because of ill health. Follow BBC Yorkshire onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external.

"Matt Hancock had Gina Coladangelo with him when he visited the BBC on 6 June Health Secretary Matt Hancock has resigned after he admitted breaching social distancing guidance, saying ""those of us who make these rules have got to stick by them"". His resignation and apology followedphotos published by the Sun newspaper,externalshowing him in an embrace with a colleague, Gina Coladangelo. The paper says the photos of the pair - both of whom are married - were taken inside the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) on 6 May 2021. Labour and the Liberal Democrats had called for the health secretary to be sacked before he quit. Social distancing in workplaces is not a legal requirement, but it is recommended. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE)says,external: ""Where possible you should keep people 2m apart. If this is not viable, keeping 1m apart with risk mitigation is acceptable."" The government'sguidelines,externalsay: ""When you cannot redesign an activity to meet social distance guidelines, ask if your business can continue without that activity."" Face coverings are not mandatory in offices. Guidance says they are ""not a replacement for the other ways of managing risk including ""minimising time spent in contact"". On 6 May, England was still atStage 2 of Covid restrictions. When it came to gatherings indoors, the law stated: ""No person may participate in a gathering... which consists of two or more people and takes place indoors."" There was an exception for work purposes but only if the gathering was ""reasonably necessary"". ""I cannot see how that exception could apply in the circumstances,"" Adam Wagner, a barrister from Doughty Street Chambers who is an expert on the lockdown restrictions told BBC Reality Check. ""Based on what we know, this seems to me to have been an illegal gathering."" The week before the photo is said to have been taken, Mr Hancock said: ""This is no time for complacency, it's a time for caution."" Speaking at aDowning Street press conference,external, he reminded the public to ""remember the basics of hands, face, space, and fresh air"". On 11 May, he said that once restrictions were eased he would be ""trusting people's personal responsibility"" on whether to hug others. He told Sky News: ""It depends on people's circumstances."" On 16 May, he told Sky News: ""Of course, there's people who have been yearning to have some physical contact - you should do that carefully."" On the subject of hugging, he added: ""The thing I'm really looking forward to is hugging my Mum... we'll probably do it outside and keep the ventilation going."" That was the day before hugging was allowed under the guidelines, on 17 May. A year before the photos were taken, he commented on the actions of Prof Neil Ferguson. Prof Ferguson quit as a government adviser afterthe Telegraph reported,externalthat a woman he was said to be in a relationship with had visited his home in lockdown. At the time, Mr Hancock told Sky News that it was ""just not possible"" for Prof Ferguson to continue advising the government. He said the social distancing rules ""are there for everyone"" and are ""deadly serious"". The Ministerial Code,externalsays ministers ""are expected to maintain high standards of behaviour and to behave in a way that upholds the highest standards of propriety"". It also says that they ""must ensure that no conflict arises, or could reasonably be perceived to arise, between their public duties and their private interests, financial or otherwise"". A DHSC spokesperson was asked about the appointment of Gina Coladangelo (a friend of Mr Hancock since university) as a non-executive director of the health department last year and said: ""This appointment was made in the usual way and followed correct procedure"". Dr Catherine Haddon, from the Institute of Government, says: ""There is a good case to be made that Hancock may have broken some... aspects of the ministerial code"". But she questioned whether an inquiry into this would take place: ""It is still up to the prime minister to decide whether the Independent Adviser on Ministerial Interests can look into a minister"". Downing Street had said Boris Johnson had accepted Mr Hancock's apology and considered the matter closed, before the health secretary stepped down on Saturday, 26 June.

"The star says she wants her conservatorship to end - but how realistic are her prospects? Britney Spears has apologised to fans for ""pretending like I've been OK"", while suffering under what she calls an ""abusive"" conservatorship. The star told a US court on Wednesday that she wants the conservatorship - which controls her personal life and finances - to end after 13 years. She revealed the arrangement requires her to use birth control and prevents her from marrying her boyfriend. On Instagram, she said she had not spoken out before due to ""pride"". ""I'm bringing this to people's attention because I don't want people to think my life is perfect because it's definitely not at all, and if you have read anything about me in the news this week... you obviously really know now it's not,"" she said. Spears apologised to fans for hiding the truth from them, adding: ""I did it because of my pride and I was embarrassed to share what happened to me... but honestly who doesn't want to capture there [sic] Instagram in a fun light!""

The 39-year-old has been under the conservatorship since 2008, when concerns over her mental health prompted her father, Jamie Spears, to petition the court for legal authority over his daughter's life. In court on Wednesday, Britney read a prepared statement asking for the arrangement to end. ""I've been in denial. I've been in shock. I am traumatised,"" she said in the emotional, 23-minute speech. ""I just want my life back."" In response, Britney's father said he always had her best interests at heart. So what are the chances of the conservatorship coming to an end? We asked two lawyers with experience of family law and conservatorships in the US -Alexander Ripps of Bohm Wildish & Matsen,,externalandChristopher Melcher of Walzer Melcher,external- for their analysis. Britney Spears: Everything she said in court Britney Spears in blistering attack on guardianship Timberlake leads outpouring of support for Britney The Britney Spears conservatorship case explained How effective was Britney in arguing her case? Christopher Melcher:From a legal strategy standpoint, I don't know that her statement helped her that much. It helped us, as the public, to know what she wants, and ended the speculation over whether she was under this conservatorship voluntarily. She made that crystal clear. If I were preparing her, I would have coached her to present herself in a calm way, acknowledging that she did have problems 13 years ago that justified protection; showing awareness of what those problems were; and articulating the steps she's taken to make sure that she doesn't find herself in that situation again. That would provide assurance to the court that she doesn't need that help. If it was a calm presentation, the court would struggle to find a reason why this conservatorship is needed. But we did see a more explosive, emotional, raw statement from Britney. I understand why she would feel that way, but I don't know that she did herself any favours. Alexander Ripps:Based on my reading of the transcript I think it was effective. If you cut through it all, she said in unequivocal terms that she wants the conservatorship terminated. While acknowledging she still has issues to work through, she has now directly placed her opposition to the conservatorship in front of the court. The bar for conservatorship is meant to be very high; and if Britney can show that her mental condition has improved since the conservatorship was put in place, the court should re-evaluate the need for the conservatorship. Britney says she's being prevented from marrying her boyfriend Sam Asghari What is the next step, from a legal standpoint? Christopher Melcher:So, Wednesday's hearing was just to hear from Britney. She made it clear that she wants to end the conservatorship but she hasn't asked to do so formally. The next step is to file a petition to terminate the order - and then the court would have a hearing. Alexander Ripps:In the petition, Britney would have to state facts showing that the conservatorship is no longer required or that the grounds for establishing the conservatorship no longer exist. Once the petition is filed, a hearing date would be set. At some point prior to the hearing, the court investigator should interview Britney and then submit a report to the court. Of course, interested parties would be allowed to file their objections. Christopher Melcher:Britney commented on that. She said that she was opposed to being evaluated. So the court can order the evaluation - but it can't physically force her to go there and answer questions. If Britney doesn't get evaluated, the court can consider her refusal to do so as a grounds for denying her petition to terminate [the conservatorship]. So we'll see how that plays out. She said in court that she had researched previous conservatorship cases, and there have been instances where an evaluation has not been required. Is that true, in your experience? Christopher Melcher:The court is not required to have one. To me, placing an adult under conservatorship is an extreme measure. This is taking away a person's liberty to make decisions that ordinarily an adult would make for themselves. We shouldn't do that for someone unless they're gravely disabled - developmentally disabled, unable to care for themselves, or resist undue influence. I think a judge should be able to tell that pretty quickly, just by interviewing someone. If they're able to have a 30-minute conversation with the court, we can tell a lot from that. And I do wonder what is an evaluation really going to reveal. The star told the court she had been forced to tour against her will Britney's lawyer requested that any further hearings will be held in private, so could this be the last we hear about the arguments in public? Christopher Melcher:That was a surprise from the testimony on Wednesday - that it wasn't in a closed session. I was hoping, for Britney's sake, that the court would close the courtroom to the public, because the nature of this conservatorship is highly personal. It involves medical issues, mental health issues, conflict with her father. I don't think it's healthy for Britney to have all that information blasted out in public and to be critiqued and repeated. I suspect most people who find themselves under a conservatorship would protest that it's unfair. Has that been your experience? Christopher Melcher:That's exactly right. The conservatorship, by its nature, is one adult controlling another adult. And anyone who's aware enough of their situation would protest about that, probably. The question is whether it's necessary. For Britney, I don't know what the evidence is going to be when she does make a motion to terminate. Can she bring in acquaintances that have seen her daily activities, who can attest that there's been no erratic behaviour? Or has she been isolated so much that she doesn't have any of those favourable witnesses? And will the conservators testify as to observations they've had of her behaviour that would justify the court in continuing the conservatorship? Are there recordings of Britney, maybe in a private setting, that would show, one way or the other, how she's behaving? These are all things that are going to be coming out Is there any way her conservators could prevent her from filing a petition to end the conservatorship? Alexander Ripps:No. The right of a conservatee to file a petition to terminate the conservatorship is based on the statutory provision of California Probate Code Sec. 1861(a). What sort of arguments could they mount to keep the arrangement in place? Alexander Ripps:Keep in mind that there are two elements to the conservatorship: Conservatorship of the person and conservatorship of the estate [ie Britney's finances]. Conservatorship of the estate can be warranted for someone who is substantially unable to manage their financial resources, or someone who is substantially unable to resist fraud or undue influence. This is where I think there has potentially been a disconnect with the public. I don't think the public has been privy to all the information as it relates to what was going on Britney's life that may have made her susceptible to undue influence.

"Bede Mullen (l) and Mark Murray (r) were both abused at the college Men who were sexually abused as boys at a training school for Roman Catholic priests have welcomed a bishop's ""momentous"" apology. The group were pupils at St Peter Claver College in Mirfield, West Yorkshire, when they were molested in the 1960s and 70s. At a meeting with the men, the Bishop of Leeds said their abusers were people they should have been able to trust. One victim said the apology marked a changing attitude from the church. St Peter Claver was a seminary run by a Roman Catholic mission, The Verona Fathers, now known as the Comboni Order. Former students who experienced sexual abuse at the school said their complaints had been ignored for decades by the church. One victim, Bede Mullen, said the abuse and the way the victims had been treated had a major impact on all of their lives, with the message up until now being: ""Go away and forget it."" ""It's a constant presence, it's always there - the feeling you are not being believed,"" he said. ""Two of our members have died before this apology. Many have suffered fractured lives largely due to their experiences as children,"" he said. Bede Mullen said the abuse had a major impact on the lives of the victims He said the bishop's apology was the first time a senior figure in the church had acknowledged what had happened to them. ""It has been a long journey, it has taken decades. It is a tremendous gesture by the bishop and we are deeply appreciative of it."" Mr Mullen has previously said that boys at the seminary were called from their dormitory at night to visit the priests in their room, often on the pretext of saying prayers together. There were occasions when one priest joined boys in the showers on the pretence of hurrying them up, he said. At a meeting attended remotely by high-ranking church officials, The Bishop of Leeds, the Rt Rev Marcus Stock, said he had spent much time ""praying and reflecting"" on how to express the shame he felt for the victims' abuse and their subsequent treatment. While he accepted the personal apology could be viewed as ""too little, too late"", he offered the men his ""heartfelt apology for the pain and trauma"" they had experienced. ""I wish, therefore, here and now, to apologise to you personally and unreservedly for the childhood sexual abuse you suffered,"" he said. ""Because they have been ignored, because they have not been listened to, and that too is a form of abuse and that is why it was important I had this meeting with them."" He said the Pope was aware the men had not had an ""adequate pastoral response"" from the leadership of the Comboni Order. The Bishop of Leeds, the Rt Rev Marcus Stock, said he offered his ""heartfelt"" apology to the men Another victim, Mark Murray, from St Asaph, Denbighshire, Wales, said the apology was ""a momentous thing"". ""We've never had that. We've always been ignored, really,"" he said. Mr Murray added that the only time the church had previously engaged with the victims was through the courts. ""I think it highlights a change in the Catholic church, where more people are beginning to listen to victims and survivors,"" he said. Mark Murray said the bishop's apology was the first time the church had acknowledged what had happened The meeting was also attended by Cardinal Vincent Nichols, Archbishop of Westminster, and Archbishop Charles Scicluna of Malta, who is Adjunct Secretary of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith - the body responsible for dealing with clerical sexual abuse cases within the Catholic church. Mr Mullen said the men hoped to get a meeting with the Pope and were encouraged by the presence of Archbishop Scicluna. The Comboni Orderpaid compensation in 2014 to 11 menwho said they had been abused at the college, however it has never formally acknowledged the abuse. Mr Murray said he did not think he would trust any apology from the order: ""An apology from the Combonis may be seen as a forced apology and I wouldn't want that. It has to come from the heart."" Meanwhile, Mr Mullen said: ""You can't wait for over a decade for an apology and believe it."" The abuse took place at St Peter Claver College in Mirfield in the 1960s and 70s During the meeting, the Bishop of Leeds acknowledged he had not been successful in arranging a meeting between the victims and the Comboni Order. In a statement issued following the bishop's apology, The Comboni Order said: ""It was with great sadness and regret that we learned about the allegations of non-recent abuse relating to our former junior seminary which closed in 1984. ""We acknowledge the harm caused by child abuse and have publicly apologised for any abuse suffered by former seminarians."" It said it had worked to respond with ""seriousness and sensitivity to the complaints and claims made"" and had co-operated with the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse. It said it condemned any action which caused ""harm or distress"" to others. ""The health, safety and wellbeing of every child remains our absolute priority, and we subscribe to the comprehensive national safeguarding policies and procedures of the Catholic Church in the UK to ensure this is paramount,"" the statement added. West Yorkshire Police investigated reports of historical sexual abuse at the seminary, but said as two of the named suspects were dead, the investigation could go no further. A third suspect is alive, but is in Italy and cannot be extradited because of ill health. Follow BBC Yorkshire onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external.

"Matt Hancock had Gina Coladangelo with him when he visited the BBC on 6 June Health Secretary Matt Hancock has resigned after he admitted breaching social distancing guidance, saying ""those of us who make these rules have got to stick by them"". His resignation and apology followedphotos published by the Sun newspaper,externalshowing him in an embrace with a colleague, Gina Coladangelo. The paper says the photos of the pair - both of whom are married - were taken inside the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) on 6 May 2021. Labour and the Liberal Democrats had called for the health secretary to be sacked before he quit. Social distancing in workplaces is not a legal requirement, but it is recommended. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE)says,external: ""Where possible you should keep people 2m apart. If this is not viable, keeping 1m apart with risk mitigation is acceptable."" The government'sguidelines,externalsay: ""When you cannot redesign an activity to meet social distance guidelines, ask if your business can continue without that activity."" Face coverings are not mandatory in offices. Guidance says they are ""not a replacement for the other ways of managing risk including ""minimising time spent in contact"". On 6 May, England was still atStage 2 of Covid restrictions. When it came to gatherings indoors, the law stated: ""No person may participate in a gathering... which consists of two or more people and takes place indoors."" There was an exception for work purposes but only if the gathering was ""reasonably necessary"". ""I cannot see how that exception could apply in the circumstances,"" Adam Wagner, a barrister from Doughty Street Chambers who is an expert on the lockdown restrictions told BBC Reality Check. ""Based on what we know, this seems to me to have been an illegal gathering."" The week before the photo is said to have been taken, Mr Hancock said: ""This is no time for complacency, it's a time for caution."" Speaking at aDowning Street press conference,external, he reminded the public to ""remember the basics of hands, face, space, and fresh air"". On 11 May, he said that once restrictions were eased he would be ""trusting people's personal responsibility"" on whether to hug others. He told Sky News: ""It depends on people's circumstances."" On 16 May, he told Sky News: ""Of course, there's people who have been yearning to have some physical contact - you should do that carefully."" On the subject of hugging, he added: ""The thing I'm really looking forward to is hugging my Mum... we'll probably do it outside and keep the ventilation going."" That was the day before hugging was allowed under the guidelines, on 17 May. A year before the photos were taken, he commented on the actions of Prof Neil Ferguson. Prof Ferguson quit as a government adviser afterthe Telegraph reported,externalthat a woman he was said to be in a relationship with had visited his home in lockdown. At the time, Mr Hancock told Sky News that it was ""just not possible"" for Prof Ferguson to continue advising the government. He said the social distancing rules ""are there for everyone"" and are ""deadly serious"". The Ministerial Code,externalsays ministers ""are expected to maintain high standards of behaviour and to behave in a way that upholds the highest standards of propriety"". It also says that they ""must ensure that no conflict arises, or could reasonably be perceived to arise, between their public duties and their private interests, financial or otherwise"". A DHSC spokesperson was asked about the appointment of Gina Coladangelo (a friend of Mr Hancock since university) as a non-executive director of the health department last year and said: ""This appointment was made in the usual way and followed correct procedure"". Dr Catherine Haddon, from the Institute of Government, says: ""There is a good case to be made that Hancock may have broken some... aspects of the ministerial code"". But she questioned whether an inquiry into this would take place: ""It is still up to the prime minister to decide whether the Independent Adviser on Ministerial Interests can look into a minister"". Downing Street had said Boris Johnson had accepted Mr Hancock's apology and considered the matter closed, before the health secretary stepped down on Saturday, 26 June.

"Matt Hancock was pictured leaving Downing Street with Gina Coladangelo on 1 May Labour has called on Boris Johnson to sack Matt Hancock amid reports of an extra-marital affair with a close aide. It said that if the health secretary had been ""secretly having a relationship"" with Gina Coladangelo - whom he appointed - this would be a ""blatant abuse of power"". But Mr Hancock's colleagues rallied around him, calling allegations of an affair ""a personal matter"". The Sunpublished pictures,externalof Mr Hancock and Ms Coladangelo kissing. It said these had been taken in the Department of Health offices in May this year. Mr Hancock cancelled a visit to a Covid vaccination centre at Newmarket Racecourse, in his constituency, on Friday morning, a few hours after the Sun's story was published. Queen describes health secretary as 'poor man' Hancock defends NHS data sharing plan Ms Coladangelo, who has known the health secretary since they were at Oxford University together, was made a non-executive director of the Department of Health last September. The role comes with a Â£15,000 salary and involves 15-to-20 days of work per year. A government spokesman said Ms Coladangelo's appointment had been ""made in the usual way"" and had ""followed correct procedure"". But Labour Party chairwoman Annaliese Dodds said: ""If Matt Hancock has been secretly having a relationship with an adviser in his office - whom he personally appointed to a taxpayer-funded role - it is a blatant abuse of power and a clear conflict of interest. ""The charge sheet against Matt Hancock includes wasting taxpayers' money, leaving care homes exposed and now being accused of breaking his own Covid rules. ""His position is hopelessly untenable. Boris Johnson should sack him."" Born in Cheshire in October 1978, he studied at Oxford and Cambridge universities. He worked for his family software firm and as a Bank of England economist before becoming chief of staff to George Osborne when he was shadow chancellor. Mr Hancock was elected MP for West Suffolk in 2010, becoming a minister in 2012 and being promoted to culture secretary in January 2018. He has been health secretary since July 2018 and ran for Conservative leader in 2019, pulling out of the contest after coming sixth in the first MPs' ballot. Mr Hancock is married with three children and is a keen cricketer and horse rider, having won a race at the Newmarket course, in his constituency, in 2012. The Liberal Democrats called on Mr Hancock to resign and accused him of ""hypocrisy"" over social distancing. Health spokeswoman Munira Wilson said: ""He was telling families not to hug loved ones, while doing whatever he liked in the workplace."" Following the publication of the Sun's story, a friend of the Mr Hancock told the BBC he had ""no comment on personal matters"", adding: ""No rules have been broken."" Transport Secretary Shapps also told Sky News that Ms Coladangelo - who is also marketing and communications director at fashion and homeware retailer Oliver Bonas - would have gone through an ""incredibly rigorous"" process to get her government role. International Development Secretary Truss told the BBC: ""[Mr Hancock] does have my support [in cabinet]. This is a personal matter. I understand that he hasn't broken any of the rules."" Ms Coladangelo, 43, is married to Oliver Bonas founder Oliver Tress and Mr Hancock's wife of 15 years, Martha, is an osteopath.

"Matt Hancock was pictured leaving Downing Street with Gina Coladangelo on 1 May Health Secretary Matt Hancock has admitted breaking social distancing guidance after pictures of him kissing an aide were published in a newspaper. He said he had ""let people down"" after photos emerged of him with Gina Coladangelo - whom he appointed - and he was ""very sorry"". Labour urged the PM to sack Mr Hancock, calling his position ""untenable"". But Downing Street said Boris Johnson accepted Mr Hancock's apology and considered the matter closed. A spokesman added that the prime minister had full confidence in the health secretary. The Sun reported that its pictures of Mr Hancock and Ms Coladangelo, who are both married with three children, had been taken inside the Department of Health on 6 May. How did Matt Hancock break Covid restrictions? Matt Hancock: A high profile health secretary Queen describes health secretary as 'poor man' Social distancing at work is not a legal requirement, but the government recommends that peoplekeep 2m apart,externalwhere possible - or 1m with ""risk mitigation"", such as standing side-by-side or wearing masks. Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said his cabinet colleague was ""right to apologise"", telling BBC Radio's 4 Any Questions programme: ""There's a task to be done. Matt is on the job doing that, and I think we should allow him to get on with the job."" He added: ""The rules have been hard. It is everybody's duty to follow the rules, but equally I've not been somebody who has criticised and condemned people when they've made mistakes."" This video can not be played Labour's Anneliese Dodds on Matt Hancock: The prime minister needs to act Labour's Emily Thornberry, the shadow international trade secretary, told the same programme that Mr Hancock's actions showed ""an arrogance that they believe they're above the law"", adding that ""he should have gone a long time ago"". ""What we're talking about is somebody breaking the rules for which they were personally responsible - where they were on television night after night telling us that we weren't allowed to have intimate contact with people from outside our households,"" she said. And a Labour spokesperson said the matter was ""definitely not closed, despite the government's attempts to cover it up"". The government believes no laws were broken because Mr Hancock and Ms Coladangelo were both in the department for legitimate work purposes, sources say. The Liberal Democrats called on Mr Hancock to resign and accused him of ""hypocrisy"" over social distancing. Boris Johnson doesn't do ministerial resignations. He resists calls from the opposition, the media - and even his own colleagues. His then aide Dominic Cummings wasn't sacked last spring for his 260-mile trip to Durham during lockdown. Unlike with Mr Cummings, there has been no cacophonous clamour from Mr Hancock's Conservative colleagues for him to go straight away. But there are concerns that he won't have credibility in the Commons or in the country to argue that the existing restrictions should be respected. And in retaining Mr Hancock in office, Boris Johnson has enabled political opponents to revive an attack which they believe has resonance with voters: that there is one rule for ministers - and another for everyone else. The Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group said it was ""heartbreaking"" that Mr Hancock had been ""ignoring the rules while we were unable to hug friends and family at our loved ones' funerals"". The group wrote to the prime minister, saying that if the health secretary was ""unable to find the decency to do the right thing and resign his position, it is paramount that you relieve him from it"". In a statement, Mr Hancock, 42, said: ""I accept that I breached the social distancing guidance in these circumstances. I have let people down and am very sorry. ""I remain focused on working to get the country out of this pandemic, and would be grateful for privacy for my family on this personal matter."" The Metropolitan Police said it was not investigating Mr Hancock over alleged breaches of Covid regulations as it did not look into Covid-related issues retrospectively ""as a matter of course"". The force added it was aware of the images alleged to have been obtained within official government premises but ""at this time this remains a matter for the relevant government department"". Ms Coladangelo, a friend of the health secretary since they worked on a student radio station at Oxford University, was made a non-executive director of the Department of Health last September. The role comes with a Â£15,000 salary and involves 15 to 20 days of work per year. Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner has written to the cabinet secretary - the UK's most senior civil servant - asking him to investigate whether Mr Hancock broke ministerial rules by failing to ""declare that he was engaged in a relationship with someone whom he personally appointed at taxpayers' expense"". A government spokesman said Ms Coladangelo's appointment had been ""made in the usual way"" and had ""followed correct procedure"". The Times has reported that Mr Hancock failed to declare their friendship when appointing Ms Coladangelo - who is also communications director for fashion retailer Oliver Bonas - as an adviser in March last year. She held the role for six months, before she was appointed to the Department of Health's non-executive board. In May last year, epidemiologist Prof Neil Ferguson resigned from the government's scientific advisory group (Sage) after it emerged he had broken lockdown rules when a woman he was reportedly in a relationship with visited his home. At the time Mr Hancockcalled these actions ""extraordinary"",adding that social distancing rules were ""there for everyone"" and ""deadly serious"". On Friday, Labour's First Minister of Wales, Mark Drakeford, said Mr Hancock had been ""quick to condemn"", adding: ""We can't make laws for other people and not be willing to abide by them yourself.""

"Matt Hancock was pictured leaving Downing Street with Gina Coladangelo on 1 May Labour has called on Boris Johnson to sack Matt Hancock amid reports of an extra-marital affair with a close aide. It said that if the health secretary had been ""secretly having a relationship"" with Gina Coladangelo - whom he appointed - this would be a ""blatant abuse of power"". But Mr Hancock's colleagues rallied around him, calling allegations of an affair ""a personal matter"". The Sunpublished pictures,externalof Mr Hancock and Ms Coladangelo kissing. It said these had been taken in the Department of Health offices in May this year. Mr Hancock cancelled a visit to a Covid vaccination centre at Newmarket Racecourse, in his constituency, on Friday morning, a few hours after the Sun's story was published. Queen describes health secretary as 'poor man' Hancock defends NHS data sharing plan Ms Coladangelo, who has known the health secretary since they were at Oxford University together, was made a non-executive director of the Department of Health last September. The role comes with a Â£15,000 salary and involves 15-to-20 days of work per year. A government spokesman said Ms Coladangelo's appointment had been ""made in the usual way"" and had ""followed correct procedure"". But Labour Party chairwoman Annaliese Dodds said: ""If Matt Hancock has been secretly having a relationship with an adviser in his office - whom he personally appointed to a taxpayer-funded role - it is a blatant abuse of power and a clear conflict of interest. ""The charge sheet against Matt Hancock includes wasting taxpayers' money, leaving care homes exposed and now being accused of breaking his own Covid rules. ""His position is hopelessly untenable. Boris Johnson should sack him."" Born in Cheshire in October 1978, he studied at Oxford and Cambridge universities. He worked for his family software firm and as a Bank of England economist before becoming chief of staff to George Osborne when he was shadow chancellor. Mr Hancock was elected MP for West Suffolk in 2010, becoming a minister in 2012 and being promoted to culture secretary in January 2018. He has been health secretary since July 2018 and ran for Conservative leader in 2019, pulling out of the contest after coming sixth in the first MPs' ballot. Mr Hancock is married with three children and is a keen cricketer and horse rider, having won a race at the Newmarket course, in his constituency, in 2012. The Liberal Democrats called on Mr Hancock to resign and accused him of ""hypocrisy"" over social distancing. Health spokeswoman Munira Wilson said: ""He was telling families not to hug loved ones, while doing whatever he liked in the workplace."" Following the publication of the Sun's story, a friend of the Mr Hancock told the BBC he had ""no comment on personal matters"", adding: ""No rules have been broken."" Transport Secretary Shapps also told Sky News that Ms Coladangelo - who is also marketing and communications director at fashion and homeware retailer Oliver Bonas - would have gone through an ""incredibly rigorous"" process to get her government role. International Development Secretary Truss told the BBC: ""[Mr Hancock] does have my support [in cabinet]. This is a personal matter. I understand that he hasn't broken any of the rules."" Ms Coladangelo, 43, is married to Oliver Bonas founder Oliver Tress and Mr Hancock's wife of 15 years, Martha, is an osteopath. The government'sguidelines for Englandon hugging friends who are not part of your household states that people can exercise ""personal judgement"", but should remain cautious. In May last year, epidemiologist Professor Neil Ferguson resigned from the government's scientific advisory group (SAGE) after it emerged he had broken lockdown rules when a woman he was reportedly in a relationship with visited his home. Mr Hancockcalled Prof Ferguson's actions ""extraordinary"",adding that social distancing rules were ""there for everyone"" and were ""deadly serious"".

"Central parts of Australia's largest city will enter a second lockdown on Saturday More than one million people in Sydney's central and eastern suburbs, including Bondi Beach, will be locked down after a jump in Covid cases. The Australian city is battling to contain an outbreak of the highly infectious Delta variant. Officials reported 17 new cases on Friday, taking the cluster to 65 cases. It is the first lockdown in Australia's largest city since December. The country has consistently maintained very low rates of Covid transmission. The stay-at-home order will affect the city centre and inner-city suburbs, as well as beachside suburbs in the east. ""We don't want to see this situation linger for weeks. We would like to see this situation end sooner rather than later,"" New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian said. But she added that medical experts believed only a targeted lockdown was necessary for now, sparing the wider city from shutting down. From Saturday, residents as well as people who work in the affected areas will have to stay at home except for essential reasons. The lockdown will be enforced until 2 July. The central business district in Sydney has become a virus hotspot Residents in the virus hotspots had already been banned from travelling out of the city. Other Australian states and territories have also blocked arrivals from Sydney. Sydney's current outbreak marks its most significant rise in Covid transmission since December. For most of the year, locals had enjoyed almost no restrictions on daily life. The cluster of infections emerged just a week ago in Bondi, the famous beach suburb, but has since spread into the city centre and to its western fringes. Sydney restricts movement amid 'dangerous' Covid outbreak The battle to open up 'Fortress Australia' It has been linked to a driver who transported international arrivals from the airport. Ms Berejiklian stressed that the stay-at-home order would also apply to workers, noting that office workers commuting to and from the central business district had brought the virus into outer suburbs. About half a million people work in Sydney's central financial district, generating about a third of the city's economy. Australia has enacted strict border closure and quarantine measures since March 2020 to keep the virus out of the country. However, very infectious strains of the virus - such as the Delta and Alpha variants - have increasingly breached the defences of the quarantine system, which is largely run out of hotels in state capitals. Since November, more than eight lockdowns have occurred in various state capitals across Australia including Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide due to leaks from quarantine hotels. Melbourne only last week emerged from a two-week lockdownto counter a Delta outbreak. Prime Minister Scott Morrison committed to plans on Friday for purpose-built quarantine centres, which critics said should have been built earlier. This video can not be played Border closures between Australian states have prevented families from reuniting Sydney's outbreak has also fuelled criticism over the federal government's slow vaccination rollout. Vaccine hesitancy has also been a problem. Spike in Australians rejecting AstraZeneca vaccine What's gone wrong with Australia's vaccine rollout? Why Australia's vaccine hesitancy is worrying experts Local media reported the driver at the centre of Sydney's outbreak had been reluctant to take the AstraZeneca vaccine due to its rare blood-clotting risk. So far, just over 3% of the adult population has been fully vaccinated and about 25% of Australians have received a first dose. Government critics, including political opposition, have argued that cities would not need to endure lockdowns again if a majority of the population was vaccinated. Sydney has seen outbreaks before but authorities have steered away from citywide lockdowns. Instead it has relied on its swift contact-tracing system and setting restrictions on targeted areas. In December, officials locked down the city's northern beaches districtto contain a cluster of about 150 cases.

"The Credgington brothers from Monmouthshire live a five-minute cycle from the ground in Amsterdam It's fair to say Wales supporters will be hugely outnumbered for Saturday's Euro 2020 knockout clash with Denmark in Amsterdam - but those who are going have pledged to make themselves heard. Danish fans aregetting extra ticketsfor the game as Welsh fans can't travel with the Netherlands currently barring non-essential visitors from the UK. But for two Welsh brothers, the last 16 encounter is ""like a home game"" as they live round the corner from the ground. They can't wait for the ""moving"" game. ""We haven't been home since the start of the pandemic because of Covid travel restrictions,"" said Sam Credgington, 26. 'World against Wales for Denmark game' Wales fans turned away from Amsterdam airport Rule-abiding pubs 'upset' by Euros fans images ""It has been quite challenging as we've missed our family and friends and although fans from Wales aren't allowed here for the game - in a weird way, it does feel like Wales is coming to see us. ""It'll be quite moving. Watching Wales is one of the greatest feelings. ""It'll be a chance to get our Wales shirts on, have a sing-song and just enjoy being Welsh with other Welsh people who live over here. It'll be a special moment for us."" Sam, a technology researcher who has lived in the Netherlands for six years, shares a house with younger brother Zach just a few blocks from Amsterdam's huge Johan Cruyff Arena. Danish fans can enter the Netherlands if they stay in the country for less than 12 hours as part ofan exemption to the entry rules,externalfor EU andSchengen area,externalresidents. The exception does not apply to Wales fans, following Brexit. Much has been made of Welsh fans that can't get to Saturday evening's football game - so the Credgington brothers feel like they're two of the ""fortunate"" ones. And the brothers, originally from Undy in Monmouthshire, have said they're ready to ""shout for an entire nation"" and help represent Welsh football's Red Wall in Amsterdam. Amsterdam's Johan Cruyff Arena was used as a template when building Cardiff's Principality Stadium ""We'll be singing our hearts out all game as there won't be many of us and there could be 4,000 Danish fans in the ground,"" masters student Zach, 24,told BBC Radio Wales. Wales defender Connor Roberts has already said ""99% of the world"" will be supporting Denmark after their ""emotionally charged"" knock-out stages qualification was inspired by midfielder Christian Eriksen and hisrecovery from a cardiac arreston the pitch. ""Yeah, there is a few things against us on Saturday but I don't think that will affect the Wales players,"" said Sam, who was due to watch Wales in Italy last weekend before Covid restrictions stopped him. This video can not be played Wales' goal hero Connor Roberts kept grounded by mum ""I'm reassured by the fantastic performance and win against Turkey, when Turkey had loads of fans in the ground in Baku - that was like an away game for Wales. ""No matter what the atmosphere is like on Saturday, I don't think it'll rattle our players who seem to rise to big occasions."" The brothers have managed to buy a Welsh flag in Amsterdam after Zach got the night off working in a bar to go to Saturday's game. Can Wales fans travel to Amsterdam for Euro 2020? England and Wales games live on BBC How much do you know about Wales v Denmark? ""As soon as it was confirmed Wales were playing here, it was excitement then chaos for us as we thought 'we've got to go',"" said Zach. ""Firstly we had to try and find some tickets from somewhere, then I had to get the night off work as I was due to to work."" Amsterdam is normally a popular destination for people from Wales with daily flights from local airports Covid restrictions ease in the Netherlands on Saturday and bars in Amsterdam can stay open until midnight ""It's bittersweet as we're so happy that the only knock-out game in Amsterdam involves Wales. But we do wish we were in the ground with thousands of our Welsh fans and our family who usually come to Wales games with us. ""But as we live just around the corner from the ground and can hear the crowd cheer on match days, there's no way we could have missed this one. No way."" Like the Credgington brothers, Dai Rees also lives in the Netherlands and went to watch Wales at Euro 2016 when the team reached the semi-final. Dai Rees has been watching Wales around Europe for almost 25 years The music teacher - and host of Coleman Had A Dream football podcast - is travelling with eight mates, three of whom are Welsh, from their homes in The Hague. ""Due to the format of Euro 2020, Wales could've played in many cities across Europe for their last 16 game - and I can't believe they're coming to Amsterdam,"" Dai, from Cardifftold BBC Radio Wales. ""It rode on last Sunday's game with Italy. If we stayed second in the group, we were coming to the Netherlands - so when Chris Gunter went close with that header in Rome, my heart was saying score but selfishly deep down I was thinking, please don't win the group as I want to see the boys play. ""The fact there's so many things against us pleases me as I think we thrive when our backs are against the wall.

"This video can not be played I'd be naive if I said there weren't going to be cases - BOA chief Anson The head of the British Olympic Association (BOA) says the organisation is still ""trying to convince"" some athletes to have the Covid vaccine before Tokyo 2020 starts next month. Chief executive Andy Anson said ""well over 90%"" of British athletes will have two vaccine doses by the Olympics. But he also admitted ""there are individuals who didn't want to be vaccinated"". ""We're trying to convince them it's the right thing to do,"" he added. ""People have got the right to choose, and we have to respect that. But it's not necessarily that helpful."" In a wide-ranging and exclusive interview withThe Sports Desk podcast, Anson said the BOA had been running a ""mammoth programme of vaccination of the whole entourage, well over 1,000 peopleâ¦ because that will lessen the risk"", but there had been challenges. ""There's been some difficulties with some athletes who have been travelling around the continent,"" he said. ""I'm pretty sure that nearly everyone will have at least one dose.

Organisers insist they will be safe and secure, but the vaccination roll-out has been slow. Coronavirus case numbers have been falling since May, when there were more than 6,000 a day across Japan, and a state of emergency in Tokyo has been lifted. In the host city, experts have said the daily infection rate should be below 100 in order to hold the Games safely. However, the city's health authorities reported 619 new infections on 23 June, and the average for the last seven days is 423 new cases a day. The BOA is sending a team of more than 370 athletes to the event.

""Eleven thousand athletes basically sharing one dining hall, that's the challenge. ""So we are putting in place very strict protocols along with [the organisers] to make sure, to the fullest extent possible, we follow the rules of isolation, distancing, and just keeping in our own 'semi bubbles'. ""We will eat together - we won't be mixing in the village like people normally would. So that's the tough bit. But we're confident that we've got enough people around from a medical perspective to make sure that environment is as safe as it possibly can be."" This week two Ugandan athletes tested positive after arriving in Japan despite being fully vaccinated. When asked if he feared similar cases involving British athletes, Anson said: ""I'd be a little naive if I said there weren't going to be. ""We've got to plan that there will be casesâ¦ we anticipate that and when there are cases, we manage them properly. ""But clearly there is that risk that people test positive. ""Being vaccinated gives you a chance to get out of any quarantine environments earlier. ""I think we all know that this pandemic is a very difficult thing to manage."" Athletes suspected of having Covid will be sent to the village's 'fever clinic', and could be moved to an 'isolation hotel' if a positive case is confirmed, ruling them out of their events. ""The athletes are very aware of the risks, because they've been competing and some have seen colleagues miss competition,"" said Anson. ""We have some brilliant people who are very focused on mental health and wellbeing. But it won't be easy if it happens."" Anson confirmed that Team GB athletes would not need to quarantine for six days on arrival in Japan after the UK was added to Japan's travel 'red list' because of rising cases of the Delta variant. ""We got in contact with the IOC and said that would be completely unfair. And they acknowledged that straight away,"" he said.

We're trying to take all of that weight off the athletes' shoulders so they can go out there and compete and enjoy it without worrying about all this other stuff. So I think they can be fun. ""There are some sad things - the fact the athletes have to leave the village within two days of competing and then come home means they won't be able to watch their fellow athletes. ""Friends and family were the one group we were trying to push back on to see if they would be allowed in the country. But the Japanese government, rightly probably, took the decision there were no international visitors. ""So that is a shame, but we will make it as positive an environment as possible."" Despite fears the Games may trigger a surge in coronavirus infections,up to 10,000 Japanese fans will be permitted at venues. ""There's nothing bigger and better than the Olympics for uniting the whole world. Yes, it's going to be tough, and different,"" said Anson. ""But I'm absolutely convinced it's the right thing to do. ""It's got the chance to lift the whole country and actually the world, and it could be an amazing experience."" Anson admitted that cancellation of the Games would have meant a ""very difficult situation for the BOA"".

"Amazon and Google are under investigation over concerns fake five star reviews on their websites could be misleading shoppers. The Competition and Markets Authority is also worried that ""law-abiding businesses"" who sell over Amazon and Google may be losing out to firms using false recommendations. Amazon and Google could face court action for breaking consumer law. Both firms say they have resources and policies in place to stop fake reviews. The CMA has launched the formal probe after an initial investigation last year examined whether online companies were doing enough to protect consumers. Online shopping has soared during the Covid pandemic as retailers deemed as ""non-essential"" have been forced to close physical shops during periods of lockdown. ""Our worry is that millions of online shoppers could be misled by reading fake reviews and then spending their money based on those recommendations,"" said CMA chief executive Andrea Coscelli. ""Equally, it's simply not fair if some businesses can fake five-star reviews to give their products or services the most prominence, while law-abiding businesses lose out.

The CMA is also examining whether Google and Amazon investigate and remove fake and misleading reviews promptly, as well as looking into what sanctions the companies place on users.

This could include securing formal commitments from Amazon and Google to change the way they deal with fake reviews, but it could escalate ""to court action if needed"". But it said: ""The CMA has not reached a view on whether Amazon and Google have broken the law at this stage."" The CMA said it was also concerned that Amazon's systems ""have been failing adequately to prevent and deter some sellers from manipulating product listings, for example, by co-opting positive reviews from other products"".

"The Stormont Executive is to divert funding of more than Â£30m in a bid to tackle Northern Ireland's growing waiting lists. The move is part of a reallocation exercise known as a monitoring round. It will also see extra funding of Â£10.7m diverted to the Department of Health to cope with pharmaceutical pressures linked to Brexit. Finance Minister Conor Murphy presented details of his proposed June monitoring round at Thursday's executive meeting. Other reallocations include Â£19m to the Executive Office to pay first-year costs of the Troubles compensation scheme, in which money will go to eligible victims and survivors of the conflict. Mr Murphy said long-term funding for the scheme would continue to be discussed with the Treasury. The Department of Education is also in line for almost Â£36m to provide additional support for children with special educational needs (SEN). Other allocations include: Â£39m to the Department for Communities, including urban renewable programmes funding and property adaptions for tenants living with disabilities Â£19.7m to the Department for Infrastructure for roads maintenance and NI Water Â£11.5m to the Department of Justice for legal service and PSNI protocol costs Â£3.5m for the Central Government Transformation Programme and IT costs across departments Â£0.9m for the Department for the Economy for Tourism NI Mr Murphy said the detail of what areas in elective care the funding will be allocated to ""is a matter for the health department"". He said a long-term strategy for investment will require ""very substantial intervention over a long number of years"". Finance Minister Conor Murphy said a long-term strategy for investment will require ""very substantial intervention"" He added that the Troubles compensation scheme is due to open in July after a slight delay. ""We haven't yet resolved the issue of who's responsible for the scheme, who pays for the scheme, that dialogue is ongoing and I hope to resolve that in the not-so-distant future,"" he said. He said the money would go directly to those applying for the scheme ""so victims won't have to wait further"". ""It was never our desire to get into a financial wrangle over this but the British government changed the scheme substantially and handed the cost over to the executive and we've been having dialogue ever since."" In recent weeks, it has emerged that some people arewaiting seven years for medical procedures in Northern Ireland. The latest waiting list figures, from January to March 2021, indicated that: More than 335,000 people were waiting for a first consultant-led appointment More than 189,000 people had been waiting longer than a year for a first outpatient appointment The departmental target is that at least half of all patients should wait no longer than nine weeks for a first appointment and no-one should wait longer than 52 weeks. It prompted Health Minister Robin Swann to suggest the size of Northern Ireland's waiting lists was ""undermining"" the principle of a free health service. He had previously said it could take up to 10 years to tackle the issue and that many people were waiting ""too long for treatment"". Northern Ireland has the worst waiting times of any UK region, with problems exacerbated by the restructuring of the health service to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic. Mr Swann said the additional waiting list funding will go towards areas including physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech and language therapy and psychological therapies. ""This will be in addition to our ongoing investment in elective care for the highest priority cases in terms of clinical need,"" Mr Swann said. ""While additional one-off allocations will always be welcome, a long-term solution to waiting lists requires sustained and guaranteed funding over a number of years."" Other health allocations also include Â£4.5m for Muckamore Abbey Hospital support costs, including funding for the alternative location of patients who might previously have been treated at Muckamore, Â£1m for cyber security and Â£11.5m capital funding. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said ""Â£31.5m is welcome but it is a far cry from what is needed. ""The truth is that this is not simply a waiting list issue; it represents a serious collapse in health services for far too many people who have been told that they have to wait for years for elective care that will improve their quality of life."" ""What we need is a longer-term strategic resource plan to deal with this crisis. ""The Department of Health and Royal College of Surgeons have identified Â£1bn is needed over the next five years to address waiting times alone. ""That critical resource needs to be accompanied by a strong political agreement to transform our health service so that patients can access treatment at the point of need."" Education Minister Michelle McIlveen welcomed the funding for children with special educational needs ""after an extremely challenging year for the education sector"". She said the money will be used ""to deal with the pressures caused by Covid-19"".

"The star says she wants her conservatorship to end - but how realistic are her prospects? Britney Spears has apologised to fans for ""pretending like I've been OK"", while suffering under what she calls an ""abusive"" conservatorship. The star told a US court on Wednesday that she wants the conservatorship - which controls her personal life and finances - to end after 13 years. She revealed the arrangement requires her to use birth control and prevents her from marrying her boyfriend. On Instagram, she said she had not spoken out before due to ""pride"". ""I'm bringing this to people's attention because I don't want people to think my life is perfect because it's definitely not at all, and if you have read anything about me in the news this week... you obviously really know now it's not,"" she said. Spears apologised to fans for hiding the truth from them, adding: ""I did it because of my pride and I was embarrassed to share what happened to me... but honestly who doesn't want to capture there [sic] Instagram in a fun light!""

The 39-year-old has been under the conservatorship since 2008, when concerns over her mental health prompted her father, Jamie Spears, to petition the court for legal authority over his daughter's life. In court on Wednesday, Britney read a prepared statement asking for the arrangement to end. ""I've been in denial. I've been in shock. I am traumatised,"" she said in the emotional, 23-minute speech. ""I just want my life back."" In response, Britney's father said he always had her best interests at heart. So what are the chances of the conservatorship coming to an end? We asked two lawyers with experience of family law and conservatorships in the US -Alexander Ripps of Bohm Wildish & Matsen,,externalandChristopher Melcher of Walzer Melcher,external- for their analysis. Britney Spears: Everything she said in court Britney Spears in blistering attack on guardianship Timberlake leads outpouring of support for Britney The Britney Spears conservatorship case explained How effective was Britney in arguing her case? Christopher Melcher:From a legal strategy standpoint, I don't know that her statement helped her that much. It helped us, as the public, to know what she wants, and ended the speculation over whether she was under this conservatorship voluntarily. She made that crystal clear. If I were preparing her, I would have coached her to present herself in a calm way, acknowledging that she did have problems 13 years ago that justified protection; showing awareness of what those problems were; and articulating the steps she's taken to make sure that she doesn't find herself in that situation again. That would provide assurance to the court that she doesn't need that help. If it was a calm presentation, the court would struggle to find a reason why this conservatorship is needed. But we did see a more explosive, emotional, raw statement from Britney. I understand why she would feel that way, but I don't know that she did herself any favours. Alexander Ripps:Based on my reading of the transcript I think it was effective. If you cut through it all, she said in unequivocal terms that she wants the conservatorship terminated. While acknowledging she still has issues to work through, she has now directly placed her opposition to the conservatorship in front of the court. The bar for conservatorship is meant to be very high; and if Britney can show that her mental condition has improved since the conservatorship was put in place, the court should re-evaluate the need for the conservatorship. Britney says she's being prevented from marrying her boyfriend Sam Asghari What is the next step, from a legal standpoint? Christopher Melcher:So, Wednesday's hearing was just to hear from Britney. She made it clear that she wants to end the conservatorship but she hasn't asked to do so formally. The next step is to file a petition to terminate the order - and then the court would have a hearing. Alexander Ripps:In the petition, Britney would have to state facts showing that the conservatorship is no longer required or that the grounds for establishing the conservatorship no longer exist. Once the petition is filed, a hearing date would be set. At some point prior to the hearing, the court investigator should interview Britney and then submit a report to the court. Of course, interested parties would be allowed to file their objections. Christopher Melcher:Britney commented on that. She said that she was opposed to being evaluated. So the court can order the evaluation - but it can't physically force her to go there and answer questions. If Britney doesn't get evaluated, the court can consider her refusal to do so as a grounds for denying her petition to terminate [the conservatorship]. So we'll see how that plays out. She said in court that she had researched previous conservatorship cases, and there have been instances where an evaluation has not been required. Is that true, in your experience? Christopher Melcher:The court is not required to have one. To me, placing an adult under conservatorship is an extreme measure. This is taking away a person's liberty to make decisions that ordinarily an adult would make for themselves. We shouldn't do that for someone unless they're gravely disabled - developmentally disabled, unable to care for themselves, or resist undue influence. I think a judge should be able to tell that pretty quickly, just by interviewing someone. If they're able to have a 30-minute conversation with the court, we can tell a lot from that. And I do wonder what is an evaluation really going to reveal. The star told the court she had been forced to tour against her will Britney's lawyer requested that any further hearings will be held in private, so could this be the last we hear about the arguments in public? Christopher Melcher:That was a surprise from the testimony on Wednesday - that it wasn't in a closed session. I was hoping, for Britney's sake, that the court would close the courtroom to the public, because the nature of this conservatorship is highly personal. It involves medical issues, mental health issues, conflict with her father. I don't think it's healthy for Britney to have all that information blasted out in public and to be critiqued and repeated. I suspect most people who find themselves under a conservatorship would protest that it's unfair. Has that been your experience? Christopher Melcher:That's exactly right. The conservatorship, by its nature, is one adult controlling another adult. And anyone who's aware enough of their situation would protest about that, probably. The question is whether it's necessary. For Britney, I don't know what the evidence is going to be when she does make a motion to terminate. Can she bring in acquaintances that have seen her daily activities, who can attest that there's been no erratic behaviour? Or has she been isolated so much that she doesn't have any of those favourable witnesses? And will the conservators testify as to observations they've had of her behaviour that would justify the court in continuing the conservatorship? Are there recordings of Britney, maybe in a private setting, that would show, one way or the other, how she's behaving? These are all things that are going to be coming out Is there any way her conservators could prevent her from filing a petition to end the conservatorship? Alexander Ripps:No. The right of a conservatee to file a petition to terminate the conservatorship is based on the statutory provision of California Probate Code Sec. 1861(a). What sort of arguments could they mount to keep the arrangement in place? Alexander Ripps:Keep in mind that there are two elements to the conservatorship: Conservatorship of the person and conservatorship of the estate [ie Britney's finances]. Conservatorship of the estate can be warranted for someone who is substantially unable to manage their financial resources, or someone who is substantially unable to resist fraud or undue influence. This is where I think there has potentially been a disconnect with the public. I don't think the public has been privy to all the information as it relates to what was going on Britney's life that may have made her susceptible to undue influence.

"The Credgington brothers from Monmouthshire live a five-minute cycle from the ground in Amsterdam It's fair to say Wales supporters will be hugely outnumbered for Saturday's Euro 2020 knockout clash with Denmark in Amsterdam - but those who are going have pledged to make themselves heard. Danish fans aregetting extra ticketsfor the game as Welsh fans can't travel with the Netherlands currently barring non-essential visitors from the UK. But for two Welsh brothers, the last 16 encounter is ""like a home game"" as they live round the corner from the ground. They can't wait for the ""moving"" game. ""We haven't been home since the start of the pandemic because of Covid travel restrictions,"" said Sam Credgington, 26. 'World against Wales for Denmark game' Wales fans turned away from Amsterdam airport Rule-abiding pubs 'upset' by Euros fans images ""It has been quite challenging as we've missed our family and friends and although fans from Wales aren't allowed here for the game - in a weird way, it does feel like Wales is coming to see us. ""It'll be quite moving. Watching Wales is one of the greatest feelings. ""It'll be a chance to get our Wales shirts on, have a sing-song and just enjoy being Welsh with other Welsh people who live over here. It'll be a special moment for us."" Sam, a technology researcher who has lived in the Netherlands for six years, shares a house with younger brother Zach just a few blocks from Amsterdam's huge Johan Cruyff Arena. Danish fans can enter the Netherlands if they stay in the country for less than 12 hours as part ofan exemption to the entry rules,externalfor EU andSchengen area,externalresidents. The exception does not apply to Wales fans, following Brexit. Much has been made of Welsh fans that can't get to Saturday evening's football game - so the Credgington brothers feel like they're two of the ""fortunate"" ones. And the brothers, originally from Undy in Monmouthshire, have said they're ready to ""shout for an entire nation"" and help represent Welsh football's Red Wall in Amsterdam. Amsterdam's Johan Cruyff Arena was used as a template when building Cardiff's Principality Stadium ""We'll be singing our hearts out all game as there won't be many of us and there could be 4,000 Danish fans in the ground,"" masters student Zach, 24,told BBC Radio Wales. Wales defender Connor Roberts has already said ""99% of the world"" will be supporting Denmark after their ""emotionally charged"" knock-out stages qualification was inspired by midfielder Christian Eriksen and hisrecovery from a cardiac arreston the pitch. ""Yeah, there is a few things against us on Saturday but I don't think that will affect the Wales players,"" said Sam, who was due to watch Wales in Italy last weekend before Covid restrictions stopped him. This video can not be played Wales' goal hero Connor Roberts kept grounded by mum ""I'm reassured by the fantastic performance and win against Turkey, when Turkey had loads of fans in the ground in Baku - that was like an away game for Wales. ""No matter what the atmosphere is like on Saturday, I don't think it'll rattle our players who seem to rise to big occasions."" The brothers have managed to buy a Welsh flag in Amsterdam after Zach got the night off working in a bar to go to Saturday's game. Can Wales fans travel to Amsterdam for Euro 2020? England and Wales games live on BBC How much do you know about Wales v Denmark? ""As soon as it was confirmed Wales were playing here, it was excitement then chaos for us as we thought 'we've got to go',"" said Zach. ""Firstly we had to try and find some tickets from somewhere, then I had to get the night off work as I was due to to work."" Amsterdam is normally a popular destination for people from Wales with daily flights from local airports Covid restrictions ease in the Netherlands on Saturday and bars in Amsterdam can stay open until midnight ""It's bittersweet as we're so happy that the only knock-out game in Amsterdam involves Wales. But we do wish we were in the ground with thousands of our Welsh fans and our family who usually come to Wales games with us. ""But as we live just around the corner from the ground and can hear the crowd cheer on match days, there's no way we could have missed this one. No way."" Like the Credgington brothers, Dai Rees also lives in the Netherlands and went to watch Wales at Euro 2016 when the team reached the semi-final. Dai Rees has been watching Wales around Europe for almost 25 years The music teacher - and host of Coleman Had A Dream football podcast - is travelling with eight mates, three of whom are Welsh, from their homes in The Hague. ""Due to the format of Euro 2020, Wales could've played in many cities across Europe for their last 16 game - and I can't believe they're coming to Amsterdam,"" Dai, from Cardifftold BBC Radio Wales. ""It rode on last Sunday's game with Italy. If we stayed second in the group, we were coming to the Netherlands - so when Chris Gunter went close with that header in Rome, my heart was saying score but selfishly deep down I was thinking, please don't win the group as I want to see the boys play.

"Mr Biden spoke to reporters after negotiations at the White House on Thursday The US Senate has struck an agreement for a $1.2tn (Â£860bn) infrastructure bill in what could herald a legislative victory for President Joe Biden. ""We have a deal,"" said the president after meeting the cross-party group of senators at the White House. The eight-year plan includes funding for roads, bridges, the power grid, public transport and internet. But the deal is far from done as Mr Biden said it depended on the passage of another, bigger spending bill. At the White House on Thursday, Mr Biden praised the group of five Republican and five Democratic senators whom he met earlier, and promised the package would generate ""millions"" of jobs. The investments are long overdue, said Mr Biden, who has persisted with the cross-party negotiations despite the impatience and scepticism of some in his Democratic party. ""We're in a race with China and the rest of the world for the 21st Century,"" he continued, adding: ""This agreement signals to the world that we can function, deliver and do significant things."" Less than half the money in the eight-year proposal is new spending. It includes $109bn for roads and bridges, $66bn for railways, $49bn for public transport and $25bn for airports, according to a White House statement. A further $73bn would be pumped into power grid and $65bn for expanding Americans' access to broadband internet. The package is meant to be paid for with unused coronavirus aid money and returned state jobless benefits. Democrats also argue the bill's proposed $40bn investment in the Internal Revenue Service for beefed-up enforcement would generate a net gain of $100bn in extra tax revenue. The plan will reportedly neither raise taxes on middle-income Americans, nor reverse the cuts to business taxes that were passed during the Trump presidency. Republicans had strongly opposed Mr Biden's calls to increase the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%, while the president had rejected a plan to hike taxes on petrol. The president wants to enact another, roughly $6tn spending package that would roll in his party's priorities on climate change, education, paid leave and childcare benefits. It is being drafted by Senator Bernie Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist. That measure is expected to include tax increases on the wealthy and corporations. It would be passed by a budget reconciliation process that would not require any Republican votes in the Senate. The most powerful Democrat in the US House of Representatives, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, made clear they would not pass one bill without the other. ""There ain't going to be a bipartisan bill without a reconciliation bill,"" Mrs Pelosi said. Mr Biden echoed that sentiment in later remarks from the East Room of the White House: ""If this is the only thing that comes to me, I'm not signing it. It's in tandem."" Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, whose support will be crucial to passage of the infrastructure bill, told Fox News: ""I think we have gone from optimism to pessimism as a result of the president's second press conference."" There was also scepticism from Democratic Senator Joe Manchin, a moderate who could effectively doom the larger bill because the upper chamber is evenly split between the two parties. He told reporters on Thursday: ""That sounds extremely, extremely high for us to take on that much debt."" Mr Biden already signed a $1.9tn coronavirus stimulus back in March. By the end of July, Congress also faces a deadline to again raise the nation's borrowing limit, which is already at $28tn in debt. A bridge collapsed on to a highway in Washington DC one day before the deal was struck In his inaugural address, Joe Biden pledged to work with Republicans to reach bipartisan consensus. For the first five months of his presidency, however, Mr Biden and the Democrats have mostly had to go it alone - on an expansive Covid relief package and on confirming nominees to the administration and the judiciary. Now, after extended negotiations, it appears that the White House has found a way to work with a handful of Senate Republicans to pass an infrastructure spending package. It's not the ""epiphany"" candidate Biden promised would occur among conservatives during his presidency, but for a White House that has laboured for a deal, it's a start. There are still many ways this agreement could go sideways, however. Mr Biden's strategy of passing this bipartisan legislation alongside a more ambitious Democrat-only package of spending on social programmes will be a tricky dance. If the former fails, centrist Democrats may vote against the liberal agenda. If Democrats can't stick together on the latter, then progressive senators - growing wary of this administration - could scuttle the former. Mr Biden, a veteran of the US Senate, likes to boast that he knows how the chamber operates. The next few months will more than test his skills.

"Amazon and Google are under investigation over concerns fake five star reviews on their websites could be misleading shoppers. The Competition and Markets Authority is also worried that ""law-abiding businesses"" who sell over Amazon and Google may be losing out to firms using false recommendations. Amazon and Google could face court action for breaking consumer law. Both firms say they have resources and policies in place to stop fake reviews. The CMA has launched the formal probe after an initial investigation last year examined whether online companies were doing enough to protect consumers. Online shopping has soared during the Covid pandemic as retailers deemed as ""non-essential"" have been forced to close physical shops during periods of lockdown. ""Our worry is that millions of online shoppers could be misled by reading fake reviews and then spending their money based on those recommendations,"" said CMA chief executive Andrea Coscelli. ""Equally, it's simply not fair if some businesses can fake five-star reviews to give their products or services the most prominence, while law-abiding businesses lose out. ""It's important that these tech platforms take responsibility and we stand ready to take action if we find that they are not doing enough."" In particular, the CMA is concerned about whether Amazon and Google have been ""doing enough"" to ""detect fake and misleading reviews or suspicious patterns of behaviour"". This includes where the same users ""have reviewed the same range of products or businesses at similar times to each other...or where the review suggests that the reviewer has received a payment or other incentive to write a positive review"". The CMA is also examining whether Google and Amazon investigate and remove fake and misleading reviews promptly, as well as looking into what sanctions the companies place on users. The watchdog said that if it discovered the companies had broken consumer protection law, it could take enforcement action. This could include securing formal commitments from Amazon and Google to change the way they deal with fake reviews, but it could escalate ""to court action if needed"". But it said: ""The CMA has not reached a view on whether Amazon and Google have broken the law at this stage."" The CMA said it was also concerned that Amazon's systems ""have been failing adequately to prevent and deter some sellers from manipulating product listings, for example, by co-opting positive reviews from other products"". A spokesman for Amazon said the company devoted ""significant resources to preventing fake or incentivised reviews from appearing in our store"". ""We will continue to assist the CMA with its enquiries and we note its confirmation that no findings have been made against our business."" Google said that its policies state ""reviews must be based on real experiences"" and where it finds violations ""we take action"" including disabling user accounts. It said: ""We look forward to continuing our work with the CMA to share more on how our industry-leading technology and review teams work to help users find relevant and useful information on Google.'' A report published earlier year this by consumer group Which?,externaldiscovered an industry that specialises in providing companies with fake reviews in exchange for money or products. It found that one of these companies had 62,000 reviewers globally and charged sellers on Amazon Marketplace around Â£13 for a review. It also did bulk deals where a seller could spend Â£620 for 50 reviews or Â£8,000 for 1,000 reviews. Which? said the CMA's investigation was ""a positive step"". ""The CMA must now move swiftly towards establishing whether these companies have broken the law, said Which? director of policy and advocacy Rocio Concha. ""This should prompt Amazon and Google to finally take the necessary steps to protect users from the growing tide of fake reviews on their platforms and, if they fail to do so, the regulator must be prepared to take strong enforcement action.""

"Mr Biden spoke to reporters after negotiations at the White House on Thursday The US Senate has struck an agreement for a $1.2tn (Â£860bn) infrastructure bill in what could herald a legislative victory for President Joe Biden. ""We have a deal,"" said the president after meeting the cross-party group of senators at the White House. The eight-year plan includes funding for roads, bridges, the power grid, public transport and internet. But the deal is far from done as Mr Biden said it depended on the passage of another, bigger spending bill. At the White House on Thursday, Mr Biden praised the group of five Republican and five Democratic senators whom he met earlier, and promised the package would generate ""millions"" of jobs. The investments are long overdue, said Mr Biden, who has persisted with the cross-party negotiations despite the impatience and scepticism of some in his Democratic party. ""We're in a race with China and the rest of the world for the 21st Century,"" he continued, adding: ""This agreement signals to the world that we can function, deliver and do significant things."" Less than half the money in the eight-year proposal is new spending. It includes $109bn for roads and bridges, $66bn for railways, $49bn for public transport and $25bn for airports, according to a White House statement. A further $73bn would be pumped into power grid and $65bn for expanding Americans' access to broadband internet. The package is meant to be paid for with unused coronavirus aid money and returned state jobless benefits. Democrats also argue the bill's proposed $40bn investment in the Internal Revenue Service for beefed-up enforcement would generate a net gain of $100bn in extra tax revenue. The plan will reportedly neither raise taxes on middle-income Americans, nor reverse the cuts to business taxes that were passed during the Trump presidency. Republicans had strongly opposed Mr Biden's calls to increase the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%, while the president had rejected a plan to hike taxes on petrol. The president wants to enact another, roughly $6tn spending package that would roll in his party's priorities on climate change, education, paid leave and childcare benefits. It is being drafted by Senator Bernie Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist. That measure is expected to include tax increases on the wealthy and corporations. It would be passed by a budget reconciliation process that would not require any Republican votes in the Senate. The most powerful Democrat in the US House of Representatives, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, made clear they would not pass one bill without the other. ""There ain't going to be a bipartisan bill without a reconciliation bill,"" Mrs Pelosi said. Mr Biden echoed that sentiment in later remarks from the East Room of the White House: ""If this is the only thing that comes to me, I'm not signing it. It's in tandem."" Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, whose support will be crucial to passage of the infrastructure bill, told Fox News: ""I think we have gone from optimism to pessimism as a result of the president's second press conference."" There was also scepticism from Democratic Senator Joe Manchin, a moderate who could effectively doom the larger bill because the upper chamber is evenly split between the two parties. He told reporters on Thursday: ""That sounds extremely, extremely high for us to take on that much debt."" Mr Biden already signed a $1.9tn coronavirus stimulus back in March. By the end of July, Congress also faces a deadline to again raise the nation's borrowing limit, which is already at $28tn in debt. A bridge collapsed on to a highway in Washington DC one day before the deal was struck In his inaugural address, Joe Biden pledged to work with Republicans to reach bipartisan consensus. For the first five months of his presidency, however, Mr Biden and the Democrats have mostly had to go it alone - on an expansive Covid relief package and on confirming nominees to the administration and the judiciary. Now, after extended negotiations, it appears that the White House has found a way to work with a handful of Senate Republicans to pass an infrastructure spending package. It's not the ""epiphany"" candidate Biden promised would occur among conservatives during his presidency, but for a White House that has laboured for a deal, it's a start. There are still many ways this agreement could go sideways, however. Mr Biden's strategy of passing this bipartisan legislation alongside a more ambitious Democrat-only package of spending on social programmes will be a tricky dance. If the former fails, centrist Democrats may vote against the liberal agenda. If Democrats can't stick together on the latter, then progressive senators - growing wary of this administration - could scuttle the former. Mr Biden, a veteran of the US Senate, likes to boast that he knows how the chamber operates. The next few months will more than test his skills.
