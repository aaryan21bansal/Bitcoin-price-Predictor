"NBA star Enes Kanter should be looking forward to coming to play basketball in London next week. Instead, he says he'll be staying in the USA - for fear of assassination in the UK. The 26-year-old New York Knicks centre explained to Radio 1 Newsbeat why he's cancelled his appearance at the O2 arena on 17 January. ""The Turkish government is obsessed with me,"" he said over the phone from his New York base. ""I speak out against [President] Erdogan, and so I don't feel safe. ""It's sad as I love Harry Potter, and wanted to come see all of London so badly, but I can't take the risk."" Recep Tayyip Erdogan: Turkey's pugnacious president As things stand, Kanter's Knicks team will go ahead and play their regular season game against the Washington Wizards without him. Their game in London is part of an NBA strategy to bring the sport to the world - but ironically it can't bring one of the world's best players. Kanter is an outspoken critic of the President of his native Turkey, Recep Tayyp Erdogan. The sportsman has referred to the politician as ""the Hitler of our century"". Turkey's President Erdogan has been accused of creeping authoritarianism ""I'm not saying that Erdogan's going to do an operation [against me] in London but it's more there are lots of crazy supporters of his. ""You can say that I'm paranoid but I don't want to take the risk. ""My team's security said to me 'If you go, you can't leave your room or do any activities for the time you're in London'. ""I'm getting more death threats, hundreds in the last few days. But I won't stop being outspoken I want the whole world to know what's going on in Turkey. ""It's bigger than basketball, it's bigger than the NBA."" Kanter is caught up in a Turkish political conflict which has spread beyond his home country's borders. President Erdogan has accused Fethullah GÃ¼len, a US-based Turkish cleric, of masterminding a failed 2016 military coup against him. Mr GÃ¼len denies the charge. Kanter, who was educated at one of Mr GÃ¼len's network of schools in Turkey, has taken the cleric's side. An anti-government protester in Turkey holds a picture of President Erdogan and exiled cleric Fethullah Gulen The basketball player regularly visits Mr GÃ¼len at the cleric's home in Pennsylvania. Kanter's moves have come at personal cost. In 2017, the sportsman's fatherMehmet was arrested in Turkeyand charged with membership of a terrorist group. Kanter suspects this was in order to put pressure on him. ""It's very sad,"" he said. ""I haven't talked to my parents for a long time. I tried bringing them here but the Turkish government wouldn't let them."" In 2017, theTurkish government cancelled Kanter's passport,forcing him to cut short a planned trip to Romania and return to the US, where he is a permanent resident and due to get citizenship in two years. Mike Bass, a spokesman for the NBA, told the BBC: ""The NBA has played hundreds of games outside of the US and this is a very unique and unprecedented situation."" The New York Knicks say Kanter's decision not to travel to London is based on visa issues, not security. Enes Kanter says he won't stop being outspoken about his political views, despite the risks But Kanter is emphatic. ""It's not a visa issue. They [the Knicks] are not going to come out and say 'Enes Kanter may get killed' - they just want to say visa issues so there is no negative energy on my team mates. ""I genuinely am worried about my safety and so are my [security] team. It'd be helpful I guess if the Knicks came out and said it."" The Knicks haven't respond to Kanter's denials that this isn't related to documentation. The UK's Home Office says that it won't comment on individual cases. But Kanter urges the authorities in the UK to make a clear promise to protect him. ""If I hear any reassurance from the British government, maybe I'll talk to my team again.""

"Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun said her passport was seized at Bangkok airport A young Saudi woman says she is stranded at Bangkok's main airport after fleeing her family and having her passport seized by a Saudi official. Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun, 18, says she was on a trip to Kuwait with her family when she fled on a flight two days ago. She was trying to head to Australia via a connecting flight in Bangkok. She told the BBC that she had renounced Islam, and feared she would be forcibly returned to Saudi Arabia and killed by her family. The BBC's Jonathan Head in Bangkok says Ms Mohammed al-Qunun is frightened and confused. She says she has an Australian visa but her passport was seized by a Saudi diplomat when he met her coming off the flight at Suvarnabhumi airport. Allow Twitter content?

A Saudi envoy in Bangkok denied any official Saudi involvement in Ms Mohammed al-Qunun's detention. ""The embassy does not have the authority to arrest (anyone) at the airport or elsewhere,"" Abdellilah al-Shaayibi told news website Sabq. ""She was stopped by airport authorities because she violated Thai laws"". Thai police Maj Gen Surachate Hakparn told the BBC that Ms Mohammed al-Qunun was escaping a marriage. Because she did not have a visa to enter Thailand, he said police had denied her entry and were in the process of repatriating her through the same airline she had taken, Kuwait Airways, by Monday morning. Gen Surachate said he was unaware of any passport seizure. He told AFP the case was a ""family problem"" and the teenager ""had no further documents such as [a] return ticket or money"". However, Human Rights Watch Asia deputy director Phil Robertson told the BBC: ""It seems that the Thai government is manufacturing a story that she tried to apply for a visa and it was denied... in fact, she had an onward ticket to go to Australia, she didn't want to enter Thailand in the first place."" He argued that the Thai authorities had clearly co-operated with Saudi Arabia as Saudi officials were able to met the plane when it arrived.

She said: ""I shared my story and my pictures on social media and my father is so angry because I did this... I can't study and work in my country, so I want to be free and study and work as I want."" Ms Mohammed al-Qunun wrote on Twitter that she had decided to share her name and details because she had ""nothing to lose"" now. She also shared a picture of her passport ""because I want you to know I'm real and exist"". Another tweet read: ""I'm afraid my family will kill me."" The case echoes that of another Saudi woman who was in transit to Australia in April 2017. Dina Ali Lasloom, 24, was en route from Kuwait via the Philippines but was taken back to Saudi Arabia from Manila airport by her family. She used a Canadian tourist's phone to send a message, a video of which was posted to Twitter, saying her family would kill her. Her fate on arriving back in Saudi Arabia remains unknown.

"Sumire Nakamura told a press conference: ""I'm happy when I win"" A Japanese schoolgirl is set to become the youngest professional player of the board game Go. Sumire Nakamura will be 10 when she enters the lowest professional rank of the game on 1 April. She began playing the complicated strategy game at the age of three and was competing in national tournaments in Japan by the time she was seven. The previous record was set by Rina Fujisawa, who was 11 when she became a professional player in 2010. Go player to take on Chinese AI Google's AI wins final Go challenge Facebook trains AI to beat humans at Go ""I'm happy when I win,"" the Osaka schoolgirl told a press conference in Tokyo on Saturday.  ""I want to have a title while being in junior high school."" The Japan Go Association has chosen her to take part in a programme training young players to compete with Chinese and Korean players in international tournaments. Her father, Shinya Nakamura, is also a professional player and won a national title in 1998. This video can not be played A brief guide to Go Go is thought to have originated in China several thousand years ago and is widely played in East Asian countries. It is a game of two players who take turns putting black or white stones on a 19-by-19 grid. Players win by taking control of the most territory on the board, which they achieve by surrounding their opponent's pieces with their own. The rules are simpler than those of chess, but a player typically has a choice of 200 moves, compared with about 20 in chess. It can be very difficult to determine who is winning, and many of the top human players rely on instinct.

"Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd has said she would listen ""very carefully"" to concerns over universal credit The next stage of the universal credit rollout is to be scaled back amid concerns about the controversial new benefits system. MPs were due to vote on whether to move three million benefit claimants onto universal credit in the next few weeks. But this vote has been pushed back and Parliament will instead be asked to vote on transferring just 10,000 people to the new benefits system. Labour said ministers should halt the rollout ""as a matter of urgency"". But the government says all claimants will be on universal credit by 2023 as planned. Universal credit works bymerging six different benefits,externalfor working age people into one monthly payment. The single payment is paid directly into claimants' bank accounts, covering the benefits for which they are eligible. Supporters of the welfare reform, which is being introduced in stages across the UK, say it helps simplify the old complicated benefits system. The Department for Work and Pensions has said that, under universal credit people are moving into work faster and staying in work longer. 2.2 million families are expected to gain under the system,with an average increase in income of Â£41 a week according to analysis by the Resolution Foundation think tank. However the same analysis found that 3.2 million households could lose an average of Â£48 per week. Some people already claiming universal credit say it has forced them into destitution andin some cases prostitution.Others say they have been left torely on foodbanks. The rollout has also faced criticism for running over budget and is currently years behind schedule. Universal credit: Will benefit changes affect you? 'Do I buy food or Christmas presents for my son?' More than one million people are currently in receipt of universal credit - either new claimants for benefits or those who have had a change in circumstances, perhaps by moving house. The government's plan is for almost seven million people to be on universal credit by 2023. Ministers were due to seek Parliamentary approval to move three million existing welfare claimants onto the new benefit. But now Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd will seek approval for just 10,000 people to be moved onto universal credit in the summer. That process will then be assessed and further Parliamentary approval sought before every other existing welfare claimant is moved. A source close to Ms Rudd said the pause was the right thing to do, and should reassure Parliament that she was listening to MPs' concerns. This video can not be played Universal credit: Is the government's benefit system working? Prime Minister Theresa May told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show the new benefits system would be fully rolled out by 2023, as intended. She said the government was taking its time ""to get this right"", insisting that universal credit is a better system than the one it replaces. She added: ""The legacy system we inherited from the Labour Party had nearly 1.4 million people left on benefits for almost a decade. ""Helping people into work, giving them the dignity of being in work, the ability to support their families, that's what universal credit is about."" The news that the government was pushing back the votewas first reported in the Observer on Sunday,externalwhich quoted a Whitehall source as saying Ms Rudd wants a ""fresh Parliamentary mandate"" for the reform. Ms Rudd, speaking when she was first given the job of work and pensions secretary in November last year, said she would listen ""very carefully"" to concerns over universal credit and admitted the system ""can be better"". She added that she would ""learn from errors"" and ""adjust"" the system, which she said had problems, where needed. 'I'm living on nothing' Universal credit 'hits students harder' 'People are worried sick about universal credit' Labour's shadow work and pensions secretary Margaret Greenwood described universal credit as ""deeply flawed"" and called on the government to halt the rollout ""as a matter of urgency"". Former Labour MP Frank Field, work and pensions select committee chairman, told the Observer he welcomed Ms Rudd's decision to revisit the plans. He said: ""The government seems finally to have woken up to the human catastrophe that was waiting to happen under its ill-formed plans for moving people on to universal credit."" The government should proceed with ""managed migration"" of people to universal credit ""only once it has proved to parliament that it will not push more vulnerable people to the brink of destitution"", Mr Field added. The government has agreed on several occasions to slow the pace at which universal credit is extended across the UK. Ms Rudd's predecessor, Esther McVey, hadpromisedclaimants would be given more time to switch to the new benefit and they would not have to wait as long for their money. And in the 2018 Autumn Budget last month, Chancellor Philip Hammond pledged an extra Â£1bn over five years to help those moving to the new payments and a Â£1,000 increase in the amount people can earn before losing benefits, at a cost of up to Â£1.7bn a year. Universal credit is a benefit for working-age people. It replaces six benefits - income support, income-based jobseeker's allowance, income-related employment and support allowance, housing benefit, child tax credit and working tax credit - and merges them into one payment: It was designed to make claiming benefits simpler. A single universal credit payment is paid directly into claimants' bank accounts to cover the benefits for which they are eligible. Claimants then have to pay costs such as rent out of their universal credit payment (though there is a provision for people who are in rent arrears or have difficulty managing their money to have their rent paid directly to their landlord).

"US forces are still operating in the northern Syrian city of Manbij The withdrawal of US troops from Syria depends on certain conditions, US National Security Adviser John Bolton says, in a further indication that the process is being slowed down. On a trip to Israel and Turkey, he said he would seek Turkish assurances that Kurds in northern Syria would be safe. The US also wants to ensure that the remnants of the Islamic State (IS) group are defeated, he added. President Donald Trump has faced strong criticism over the planned US pullout. When he first announced the move in the middle of December, he said: ""They're all coming back and they're coming back now."" After the president made his announcement on 19 December, US officials said American forces had been given 30 days to leave Syria. In his announcement, Mr Trump had also declared that IS had been ""defeated"". However, speaking on Sunday before leaving for his Camp David retreat, he told reporters: ""We're going to be removing our troops. I never said we were doing it that quickly. ""We're pulling out of Syria... and we won't be finally pulled out until Isis [IS] is gone."" War-weary Syrians in Manbij wait to learn fate Trump rewrites US-Syria policy After the caliphate: Has IS been defeated? Why the battle for northern Syria matters Last month's announcement shocked allies and US defence officials alike, with Defence Secretary Jim Mattis and senior aide Brett McGurk resigning soon after. On Saturday,Department of Defence chief of staff Kevin Sweeney became the third senior Pentagon official to announce his resignationsince President Trump's announcement. Meanwhile, America's Kurdish allies in north-east Syria were left feeling exposed as Turkey, which regards them as terrorists, appeared poised to move against them. But Mr Trump seemed to row back last weekwhen he said troops were being pulled out ""slowly"" and that they would be fighting remaining IS militants at the same time. This video can not be played Is this the Islamic State group's last stand in Syria? ""We don't think the Turks ought to undertake military action that is not fully co-ordinated with and agreed to by the United States at a minimum so they don't endanger our troops, but also so that they meet the president's requirement that the Syrian opposition forces that have fought with us are not endangered,"" Mr Bolton said in Israel ahead of talks with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He told reporters there was no timetable for a US withdrawal from Syria but that there was not an unlimited commitment. John Bolton (striped tie) visited excavation works under the Western Wall during a visit to Jerusalem's Old City Mr Bolton also said President Trump wanted to ensure that IS was ""destroyed"". Mr Netanyahu said he would discuss Iran's ambitions in Syria when he met Mr Bolton on Sunday evening. On Tuesday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will begin a week-long tour of the Middle East designed to reassure allies in the region. The US partnership with the Kurdish-led Syria Democratic Forces (SDF) is credited with playing a major role in the demise of IS. But the main fighting force in the SDF is the Kurdish YPG militia, which Turkey regards as a terrorist group. On Sunday, a spokesman for Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said it was ""irrational"" to suggest Turkey targeted Kurds. Ibrahim Kalin said Turkey's focus was on the YPG and the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) - which Ankara also regards as a terror group. Some 2,000 US military personnel are reported to be in Syria although the real numbers could be higher. American ground troops first became involved in Syria in autumn 2015 when then-President Barack Obama sent in a small number of special forces to train and advise local Kurdish fighters who were fighting IS. This video can not be played Is this the end for Islamic State? The US did this reluctantly after several attempts at arming anti-IS groups had descended into chaos.

"Police were urgently searching for 17-month-old Maria Tudorica A 17-month-old girl taken during a car theft has been found safe and well. Maria Tudorica was taken in Nine Acres Close, Newham, east London, at 16:37 GMT on Sunday. Scotland Yard tweeted just before 20:00 that she had been found less than a mile away in the Ruskin Avenue area. Maria was in the front passenger seat of a black Audi A5 when her father met an unknown man with a view to selling the car - but the thief jumped in and drove away. The empty vehicle was later found abandoned in nearby Hatherway Crescent. A huge police search was launched for Maria, who was born in Romania but lives in the local area with her family. The Met said Maria was found in the street wearing an additional item of clothing which they believe was given to her by the car thief or by a member of the public. Allow Twitter content?

When his niece was found, Maria's uncle, car trader Gheorghe Stelica, 25, said: ""God bless. I feel born again. ""I feel am a new guy. I feel over a thousand times relief. My brother, he's happy. He thank so much the police for their service."" Mr Stelica said he had asked his brother Claudia Stelica, 35, to show the car to the ""buyer"" as a favour because he was out of London. ""I put the car on sale today and one guy called me on my phone,"" he said. ""He didn't seem suspicious on the phone, he was talking very nicely. I said to him 'if you don't want to wait for me, no problem'."" Mr Stelica said his brother placed Maria inside the car as he demonstrated the engine, but the thief jumped in and drove off. ""He jumped up in the driver's side and - boom - straight away he went with the car,"" he added. The man who took the car is described as Asian, of slim build and dressed in black clothing. The Met has appealed for information and witnesses, particularly about whether a member of the public gave Maria the extra item of clothing.

"Seaborne's contract at Ramsgate was one of three awarded to ease ""severe congestion"" at Dover, in the case of a no-deal Brexit The Port of Ramsgate ""can not be ready"" for extra ferry services in the event of a no-deal Brexit, according to the councillor for the harbour area. Seaborne Freight has been given a Â£13.8m contract to run a freight service between Ramsgate and Ostend in the event of a no-deal Brexit. However, Conservative councillor Beverly Martin says the harbour can not be ready by Brexit on 29 March. The government said facilities will be open ""as soon as practicable"". In a statement the Department for Transport said that ""works are underway"". Ramsgate has not had a regular ferry service since 2013. Brexit: Could Channel Ports cope with no deal? Grayling defends Brexit ferry contract Brexit ferry firm in terms gaffe Seaborne's contract was one of three awarded to ease ""severe congestion"" at Dover, in the case of a no-deal Brexit. The contingency plans allow for almost 4,000 more lorries a week to come and go from other ports, including Plymouth, Poole, and Portsmouth. In total the contracts are worth Â£103m. ""From local knowledge, there is terrific concern that we [Ramsgate Port] can not possibly by ready. There isn't the width or the breadth of the berths that is needed to carry large ships,"" the councillor said. ""I don't see how, with the state of the harbour and the port and the number of repairs that are needed that it could be ready."" Ms Martin also said there had been no contact with the council about opening the harbour for larger freight ships. ""We didn't have any notification of any this at our council meeting on 6 December. Why not? This is my ward. I have not had a single email from anybody."" ""If someone can show me how the due diligence was carried out, if someone can show me evidence on paper I shall feel a lot more comfortable,""she told the BBC's Broadcasting House. The Department for Transport said it had been in dialogue with Thanet Council, which owns the port, for a couple years, and dismissed allegations that local residents had not been consulted as ""complete nonsense"". Seaborne's deal to run freight services from Ramsgate has been criticised as the company has never run a ferry service and does not own any ships. Last week the company was ridiculed for using terms and conditions on its website apparently intended for a takeaway food firm. Brexit: Could Channel Ports cope with no deal?

"Afghanistan has vast mineral wealth, including gold, but many mines are badly maintained (file photo) At least 30 people have been killed in the collapse of a gold mine in north-eastern Afghanistan, officials say. The collapse occurred in the Kohistan district of Badakhshan province. Villagers had reportedly dug a 60m (220ft) deep but makeshift shaft in a river bed to hunt for gold and were caught in its collapse. Afghanistan has vast resources of minerals but many of the mines are old and poorly maintained, creating severe safety issues. Villagers were reportedly using an excavator at the site when the mine collapsed. At least seven other people were injured, officials say. Kohistan district chief Rostam Raghi told the BBC's Afghan service: ""Locals rushed to the scene and managed to rescue only 13 workers. Dozens of others, including some children, died."" Inside a crumbling Afghan coal mine Nik Mohammad Nazari, spokesman for the provincial governor, told Agence France-Presse: ""The villagers have been involved in this business for decades with no government control over them. ""We have sent a rescue team to the area, but villagers have already started removing bodies from the site."" A spokesman for the National Disaster Management Authority told AFP the families of the dead would receive 50,000 afghanis ($660; Â£520). Afghanistan's vast resources remain largely untapped due to the conflict with the Taliban. The conflict has seen the rise in illegal mining both by villagers and Taliban fighters who use it as a key source of revenue.

"Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd has said she would listen ""very carefully"" to concerns over universal credit The next stage of the universal credit rollout is to be scaled back amid concerns about the controversial new benefits system. MPs were due to vote on whether to move three million benefit claimants onto universal credit in the next few weeks. But this vote has been pushed back and Parliament will instead be asked to vote on transferring just 10,000 people to the new benefits system. Labour said ministers should halt the rollout ""as a matter of urgency"". But the government says all claimants will be on universal credit by 2023 as planned. Universal credit works bymerging six different benefits,externalfor working age people into one monthly payment. The single payment is paid directly into claimants' bank accounts, covering the benefits for which they are eligible. Supporters of the welfare reform, which is being introduced in stages across the UK, say it helps simplify the old complicated benefits system. The Department for Work and Pensions has said that, under universal credit people are moving into work faster and staying in work longer. 2.2 million families are expected to gain under the system,with an average increase in income of Â£41 a week according to analysis by the Resolution Foundation think tank. However the same analysis found that 3.2 million households could lose an average of Â£48 per week. Some people already claiming universal credit say it has forced them into destitution andin some cases prostitution.Others say they have been left torely on foodbanks. The rollout has also faced criticism for running over budget and is currently years behind schedule. Universal credit: Will benefit changes affect you? 'Do I buy food or Christmas presents for my son?' More than one million people are currently in receipt of universal credit - either new claimants for benefits or those who have had a change in circumstances, perhaps by moving house. The government's plan is for almost seven million people to be on universal credit by 2023. Ministers were due to seek Parliamentary approval to move three million existing welfare claimants onto the new benefit. But now Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd will seek approval for just 10,000 people to be moved onto universal credit in the summer. That process will then be assessed and further Parliamentary approval sought before every other existing welfare claimant is moved. A source close to Ms Rudd said the pause was the right thing to do, and should reassure Parliament that she was listening to MPs' concerns. This video can not be played Universal credit: Is the government's benefit system working? Prime Minister Theresa May told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show the new benefits system would be fully rolled out by 2023, as intended. She said the government was taking its time ""to get this right"", insisting that universal credit is a better system than the one it replaces. She added: ""The legacy system we inherited from the Labour Party had nearly 1.4 million people left on benefits for almost a decade. ""Helping people into work, giving them the dignity of being in work, the ability to support their families, that's what universal credit is about."" The news that the government was pushing back the votewas first reported in the Observer on Sunday,externalwhich quoted a Whitehall source as saying Ms Rudd wants a ""fresh Parliamentary mandate"" for the reform. Ms Rudd, speaking when she was first given the job of work and pensions secretary in November last year, said she would listen ""very carefully"" to concerns over universal credit and admitted the system ""can be better"". She added that she would ""learn from errors"" and ""adjust"" the system, which she said had problems, where needed. 'I'm living on nothing' Universal credit 'hits students harder' 'People are worried sick about universal credit' Labour's shadow work and pensions secretary Margaret Greenwood described universal credit as ""deeply flawed"" and called on the government to halt the rollout ""as a matter of urgency"". Former Labour MP Frank Field, work and pensions select committee chairman, told the Observer he welcomed Ms Rudd's decision to revisit the plans. He said: ""The government seems finally to have woken up to the human catastrophe that was waiting to happen under its ill-formed plans for moving people on to universal credit."" The government should proceed with ""managed migration"" of people to universal credit ""only once it has proved to parliament that it will not push more vulnerable people to the brink of destitution"", Mr Field added. The government has agreed on several occasions to slow the pace at which universal credit is extended across the UK. Ms Rudd's predecessor, Esther McVey, hadpromisedclaimants would be given more time to switch to the new benefit and they would not have to wait as long for their money. And in the 2018 Autumn Budget last month, Chancellor Philip Hammond pledged an extra Â£1bn over five years to help those moving to the new payments and a Â£1,000 increase in the amount people can earn before losing benefits, at a cost of up to Â£1.7bn a year.

"Seaborne's contract at Ramsgate was one of three awarded to ease ""severe congestion"" at Dover, in the case of a no-deal Brexit The Port of Ramsgate ""can not be ready"" for extra ferry services in the event of a no-deal Brexit, according to the councillor for the harbour area. Seaborne Freight has been given a Â£13.8m contract to run a freight service between Ramsgate and Ostend in the event of a no-deal Brexit. However, Conservative councillor Beverly Martin says the harbour can not be ready by Brexit on 29 March. The government said facilities will be open ""as soon as practicable"". In a statement the Department for Transport said that ""works are underway"". Ramsgate has not had a regular ferry service since 2013. Brexit: Could Channel Ports cope with no deal? Grayling defends Brexit ferry contract Brexit ferry firm in terms gaffe Seaborne's contract was one of three awarded to ease ""severe congestion"" at Dover, in the case of a no-deal Brexit. The contingency plans allow for almost 4,000 more lorries a week to come and go from other ports, including Plymouth, Poole, and Portsmouth. In total the contracts are worth Â£103m. ""From local knowledge, there is terrific concern that we [Ramsgate Port] can not possibly by ready. There isn't the width or the breadth of the berths that is needed to carry large ships,"" the councillor said. ""I don't see how, with the state of the harbour and the port and the number of repairs that are needed that it could be ready."" Ms Martin also said there had been no contact with the council about opening the harbour for larger freight ships. ""We didn't have any notification of any this at our council meeting on 6 December. Why not? This is my ward. I have not had a single email from anybody."" ""If someone can show me how the due diligence was carried out, if someone can show me evidence on paper I shall feel a lot more comfortable,""she told the BBC's Broadcasting House. The Department for Transport said it had been in dialogue with Thanet Council, which owns the port, for a couple years, and dismissed allegations that local residents had not been consulted as ""complete nonsense"". Seaborne's deal to run freight services from Ramsgate has been criticised as the company has never run a ferry service and does not own any ships. Last week the company was ridiculed for using terms and conditions on its website apparently intended for a takeaway food firm. Brexit: Could Channel Ports cope with no deal?

"This video can not be played Ribery was criticised for posting a video of himself enjoying a gold-covered steak German football club Bayern Munich has fined its midfielder Franck Ribery after he posted a series of angry and profanity-laden tweets. The French player, 35, was responding to criticism after he shared a video of himself enjoying an expensive steak coated with gold. He hit out at ""jealous"" people and said he owed nothing to the ""haters"". The club's sporting director did not specify how much Ribery had been docked but described the fine as ""heavy"". ""He used words that we... cannot accept and that Franck does not have the right to use, as a role model and player,"" Hasan Salihamidzic told reporters on Sunday. ""I had a long talk with Franck and I let him know that we would impose a heavy fine on him and he accepted it,"" he added. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The video showed the player at a restaurant in Dubai owned by Turkish celebrity chef Nusret Gokce, who is also known as ""Salt Bae"" on social media. Ribery can be seen rubbing his hands as the huge steak, which reportedly cost 1,250 AED (Â£267, $340), is prepared in dramatic fashion at his table. It was met with a barrage of criticism from those who said the video was ostentatious. ""My success is, above all, thanks to God, me, and my loved ones who believed in me,"" Ribery said in one of his posts. The footballer criticised the media for ignoring his charity work. He said he was free to spend his money how he liked. On this occasion, the club's sporting director said Ribery had been invited to the restaurant and so did not pay the bill. Why are footballers obsessed with Salt Bae? Gokce owns several luxurious restaurants in the US, the Middle East and Turkey, and videos of him carving meat have been watched by millions of people. He has served a number of celebrities, including footballers such as Cesc Fabregas and Kevin de Bruyne, But this is not the first time that a well-known figure has been criticised for dining at one of his restaurants. Gokce posted pictures of himself with President Maduro in his Istanbul restaurant last year In September,Venezuela's President NicolÃ¡s Maduro caused outragewhen he visited Gokce's Nusr-Et restaurant in Istanbul. Almost two-thirds of people in the crisis-hit country have reported losing weight as shortages of food worsened in recent years. Footage of Mr Maduro at the restaurant was widely shared by his critics who said he was out of touch with the problems facing Venezuela.

"Donald Trump said the wall could be made of steel, rather than concrete President Donald Trump has refused to compromise on his demand for a wall to be built on the Mexican border, the cause of a partial government shutdown. He said he did not think he would have to reduce the $5.6bn (Â£4.4bn) in funds he was demanding and repeated a threat to declare a national emergency. His new chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said earlier he expected the shutdown to ""drag on a lot longer"". Democrats refuse to back the funding, calling the wall ""immoral"". Talks to end the partial shutdown will resume later on Sunday, with the stalemate now in its third week, affecting some 800,000 federal workers. #ShutdownStories: The impact of the government shutdown How women are changing the face of Congress The wall was one of Mr Trump's key campaign pledges and he had said Mexico would pay for it, something Mexico has never agreed to. He was speaking as he left the White House for Camp David, where he will discuss policy issues with aides. ""We have to build the wall,"" he said. ""It's about safety, it's about security for our country... We have no choice... it's a very important battle to win."" Mr Trump said he thought the Democrats ""want a deal"", adding: ""The shutdown could end tomorrow or go on a long time. It really depends on the Democrats."" But he also repeated an earlier threat to declare a national emergency ""depending on what happens in the next few days"". Mick Mulvaney: ""I think this is going to drag on a lot longer"" US law allows him to direct military construction projects under those circumstances but the money would have to come from defence department funds and there would inevitably be legal challenges by the Democrats that would drag out the matter. Mr Trump also repeated the idea of building the wall out of ""steel instead of concrete"", presumably in the hope that Democrats could then claim it was not a wall. The idea has not gained traction with the Democrats so far. Mr Mulvaney told NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday that he thought the controversy was ""going to drag on a lot longer. I think that's... by intention"". He did not elaborate. The talks between the Democrats and Republicans on the shutdown will resume on Sunday afternoon. Both sides believe their core support backs their stance, so leeway is limited. A Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll suggested 50% blamed the president for the shutdown, while 32% saw the Democratic Party as culpable. Democrats House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer walk out of the West Wing One idea that has been floated, reportedly by Trump adviser Jared Kushner at the meeting on Saturday, was to give the Democrats new measures on young immigrants called ""Dreamers"", in exchange for the wall funding. Dreamers are immigrants who illegally entered the US as children. Democrats want to ensure that they are shielded from deportation but have refused to link the issue with a deal on wall funding. Some conservatives are also reportedly alarmed at any offer on the Dreamers. Ms Pelosi said after the failed talks on Saturday her party would introduce piecemeal bills aimed at reopening certain government agencies, starting with the Internal Revenue Service and the Treasury Department. ""This action is necessary so that the American people can receive their tax refunds on schedule,"" she said. The bills may amount to little more than extra pressure on the president. Partial shutdowns occur when Congress cannot agree a budget by a certain deadline or the president refuses to sign it. That happened on 22 December and a quarter of the government has been closed since, leaving some 800,000 workers either furloughed - a kind of temporary leave of absence - or working without pay. The Senate had actually reached bipartisan agreement on a budget but Mr Trump then refused to back it, demanding the funding for the wall. This video can not be played The return of the woman Republicans love to hate The House then passed a bill including funding for the wall, when the Republicans still had a majority there, but they could not get the necessary 60 votes in the 100-seat Senate. When the Democrats took control of the new Congress this week, they passed spending bills to reopen the government. The leader of the Republican-controlled Senate, Mitch McConnell, immediately called the move ""a time-wasting act of political posturing"". In Friday's news conference, Mr Trump told reporters he might consider asking his cabinet to decline a $10,000 pay rise that is due to take effect because a pay freeze has expired as an inadvertent result of the shutdown. Unpaid workers are clearly feeling the pinch. Transport Security Administration employee Brian Turner told the BBC he might have to look for another job if the shutdown continued. ""We have a five-month-old son so we have about a month left before we're going to have to start having those difficult conversations about what to do next,"" he said. Many workers, but by no means all, are likely to get back pay when the shutdown is resolved. Food and Drug Administration commissioner Scott Gottlieb said on Saturday his agency had only  a month's funding left for some of its activities. The shutdown means: About 25% of the US federal government has no funding Nine departments have been affected, including Homeland Security, Justice, Housing, Agriculture, Commerce, Interior, and the Treasury Native American tribes who receive substantial federal funding are struggling National Parks have become hazardous without staff Are you a federal employee or contractor affected by the government shutdown?

"Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun said her passport was seized at Bangkok airport A young Saudi woman says she is stranded at Bangkok's main airport after fleeing her family and having her passport seized by a Saudi official. Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun, 18, says she was on a trip to Kuwait with her family when she fled on a flight two days ago. She was trying to head to Australia via a connecting flight in Bangkok. She told the BBC that she had renounced Islam, and feared she would be forcibly returned to Saudi Arabia and killed by her family. The BBC's Jonathan Head in Bangkok says Ms Mohammed al-Qunun is frightened and confused. She says she has an Australian visa but her passport was seized by a Saudi diplomat when he met her coming off the flight at Suvarnabhumi airport. Allow Twitter content?

A Saudi envoy in Bangkok denied any official Saudi involvement in Ms Mohammed al-Qunun's detention. ""The embassy does not have the authority to arrest (anyone) at the airport or elsewhere,"" Abdellilah al-Shaayibi told news website Sabq. ""She was stopped by airport authorities because she violated Thai laws"". Thai police Maj Gen Surachate Hakparn told the BBC that Ms Mohammed al-Qunun was escaping a marriage. Because she did not have a visa to enter Thailand, he said police had denied her entry and were in the process of repatriating her through the same airline she had taken, Kuwait Airways, by Monday morning. Gen Surachate said he was unaware of any passport seizure. He told AFP the case was a ""family problem"" and the teenager ""had no further documents such as [a] return ticket or money"". However, Human Rights Watch Asia deputy director Phil Robertson told the BBC: ""It seems that the Thai government is manufacturing a story that she tried to apply for a visa and it was denied... in fact, she had an onward ticket to go to Australia, she didn't want to enter Thailand in the first place."" He argued that the Thai authorities had clearly co-operated with Saudi Arabia as Saudi officials were able to met the plane when it arrived.

She said: ""I shared my story and my pictures on social media and my father is so angry because I did this... I can't study and work in my country, so I want to be free and study and work as I want."" Ms Mohammed al-Qunun wrote on Twitter that she had decided to share her name and details because she had ""nothing to lose"" now. She also shared a picture of her passport ""because I want you to know I'm real and exist"". Another tweet read: ""I'm afraid my family will kill me."" The case echoes that of another Saudi woman who was in transit to Australia in April 2017. Dina Ali Lasloom, 24, was en route from Kuwait via the Philippines but was taken back to Saudi Arabia from Manila airport by her family.

"Criminal gangs burnt buses, shops and banks in response to tougher prison measures About 300 troops have been sent to the north-eastern Brazilian city of Fortaleza to tackle a surge in criminal violence, authorities said. Soldiers will patrol there and across the state of CearÃ¡ in a bid to halt attacks on shops, banks and buses. The justice ministry ordered the special deployment after dozens of attacks this week. The attacks are a protest against new, tougher measures in local prisons, largely controlled by criminal gangs. Prison authorities in the state have blocked mobile phone signals inside jails and ended a policy of separating inmates by gang affiliation. The troop deployment comes just days after the inauguration of President Jair Bolsonaro, who was elected to office on the promise to fight rampant crime in the country. Brazil's new far-right leader urges unity Jair Bolsonaro: Trump of the Tropics? Mr Bolsonaro reportedly praised Justice Minister Sergio Moro's decision to send in troops as ""apt, rapid and effective"". Mr Moro previously led a vast investigation into Brazilian corruptionknown as Operation Car Wash. The attacks have caused panic in Brazil's fifth largest city Despite the violence the authorities say businesses are already reopening after the troop deployment Security videos aired on Brazilian television show the gangs setting fire to service stations. About 50 suspects allegedly linked with the violence have now been arrested.

"Improvements to mental health support and maternity care are included in the plans to be announced by the PM The government's 10-year plan for the NHS lacks both the staffing and funding to succeed, Labour has said. The PM has promised the publication of the plan on Monday will lead to ""world class"" care for patients in England. Pledges on maternity care, mental health, elderly support and earlier detection and prevention of diseases will be included in the plan. But shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said Mrs May was just trying to ""clear up a mess that she has made"". Appearing on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Ashworth said: ""The funding isn't sufficient and the staffing isn't there."" He added the NHS ""doesn't need 10 more years of the Tories, it needs a Labour government"". However, Mrs May said that,coupled with the extra money announced last summer, the plan secured the future of the NHS. The budget is due to rise by Â£20bn a year above inflation by 2023, though a detailed explanation of where that money will come from has not yet been provided. Smokers in hospital to be helped to quit Six things to look out for in health in 2019 The hospitals that fail to treat patients on time Health Secretary Matt Hancock, meanwhile, admitted the health service was short staffed but said work was being done to solve the problem. He told BBC News there were ""still lots of people"" trying to become nurses in the UK and that there was a ""record number of GPs in training"".  If you can't see the NHS Tracker,click or tap here,external. A day before publication of the 10-year plan, the prime minister said the proposals marked ""a historic step"" to secure the future of the NHS, adding there was a focus on ""ensuring that every pound is spent in a way that will most benefit patients"". ""This will help relieve pressure on the NHS while providing the basis to transform care with world-class treatments,"" she said. When asked on the Andrew Marr Show why the NHS was failing to hit key waiting time targets, Mrs May blamed an increased in demand on health services. The 10-year plan, she added, was ""crucial"" for ensuring the ""sustainability"" of the NHS. Speaking to the BBC in June, Mrs May suggested funding for the plan would come from a combination of taxes and the so-called ""Brexit dividend"". However, during the summer, Commons Health and Social Care Committee chairwoman Sarah Wollaston described the idea of a Brexit dividend as ""tosh"". As healthcare policy is politically devolved, the plan only applies to the NHS in England but Mrs May said the other UK nations will be drawing up their own plans. Under the government's funding system they are getting an extra Â£4bn between them by 2023. The full details are not being unveiled until Monday when it will be released by NHS England. But Mrs May has outlined some of the key focuses. These include: Better mental health care, including round-the-clock advice from NHS 111 by 2023 and tailored services for young adults.  Currently once someone in care turns 18 they are thrust into the adult system, often when they are not ready Providing the best maternity care in the world by improving safety and providing greater mental health support for new parents. One in five new mothers struggles with mental health in the first year of her baby's life Greater control and choice in old age by expanding the use of personal budgets to allow people to decide what care they want, and greater support in the community so people do not end up in hospital Better prevention and detection of disease - cancer is expected to be a key focus with an ambition to increase the number of early detections from one in two cancers to three in four, which in turn will improve survival Increases in the NHS workforce - currently one in 11 posts is vacant Bringing the NHS into the digital age, including online GP booking, prescriptions management and health records The plan was promised during the summer when the government unveiled its funding settlement for the NHS. That set out the budget for the next five years and means by 2023 funding for the NHS will be Â£20bn a year more than it is now, once inflation is taken into account. That is the equivalent of annual ""real terms"" rises of close to 3.5% - about twice what the NHS has got since 2010. NHS England boss Simon Stevens has been in charge of drawing up the plan At the time, the prime minister said she wanted to ensure the money was used wisely and so asked NHS England boss Simon Stevens to draw up a long-term plan for the next decade. It was expected to be published in the autumn, but was delayed because of the government's troubles getting its Brexit plans agreed. The last time such a long-term vision was set out was in 2000 under Tony Blair. Understandably people want to see the full details before coming to firm conclusions. But the priority areas are being welcomed. Andy Bell, of the Centre for Mental Health, said the initiatives on mental health were much needed. He said: ""For too many young people, mental health support is offered too late, with too many restrictions and then they are forced to start again when they reach 18."" Mental health care is one of the priority areas Dame Donna Kinnair, of the Royal College of Nursing, said nurses shared the ambitions being set out. But she added the government needed to ""urgently address"" the staffing shortages if it was going to succeed. And Jennifer Dixon, chief executive of the Health Foundation think-tank, predicted fulfilling the pledges would be ""extremely tough"" because of the scale of staffing shortages, rising pressures and cuts to other parts of the wider health and care system. The Â£20bn promise just relates to the front-line NHS budget and so does not cover other elements such as social care and public health - at the end of last year it was announced the budget for these services, which includes smoking cessation and weight management, was being cut by over 4% in real terms next year. Ms Dixon said: ""Trade-offs are inevitable and these must be spelled out clearly so the public know what they can expect from the NHS."" There has been a fair bit of tension behind the scenes. The Treasury is understood to have wanted to tie the NHS down in terms of what it will achieve. One of the central bones of contention is thought to be how the NHS can tackle deficits and waiting times. Hospitals are struggling to balance their books and have seen a deterioration in the time patients wait in A&E, for cancer and for routine operations. None of these three key waiting time targets are currently being met. The NHS is missing its key waiting time targets It looks like a trajectory for improvement will be published at a later date with NHS bosses known to have been wary about promising things they felt they could not deliver. Another missing piece is the green paper on social care. This was first promised in 2017, but has been delayed on a number of occasions. Brexit has certainly been a factor, but again there has been disagreements in private, this time over how radical the plan should be given the problems facing the sector, which covers care homes and home help.

"Improvements to mental health support and maternity care are included in the plans to be announced by the PM The government's 10-year plan for the NHS lacks both the staffing and funding to succeed, Labour has said. The PM has promised the publication of the plan on Monday will lead to ""world class"" care for patients in England. Pledges on maternity care, mental health, elderly support and earlier detection and prevention of diseases will be included in the plan. But shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said Mrs May was just trying to ""clear up a mess that she has made"". Appearing on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Ashworth said: ""The funding isn't sufficient and the staffing isn't there."" He added the NHS ""doesn't need 10 more years of the Tories, it needs a Labour government"". However, Mrs May said that,coupled with the extra money announced last summer, the plan secured the future of the NHS. The budget is due to rise by Â£20bn a year above inflation by 2023, though a detailed explanation of where that money will come from has not yet been provided. Smokers in hospital to be helped to quit Six things to look out for in health in 2019 The hospitals that fail to treat patients on time Health Secretary Matt Hancock, meanwhile, admitted the health service was short staffed but said work was being done to solve the problem. He told BBC News there were ""still lots of people"" trying to become nurses in the UK and that there was a ""record number of GPs in training"".  If you can't see the NHS Tracker,click or tap here,external. A day before publication of the 10-year plan, the prime minister said the proposals marked ""a historic step"" to secure the future of the NHS, adding there was a focus on ""ensuring that every pound is spent in a way that will most benefit patients"". ""This will help relieve pressure on the NHS while providing the basis to transform care with world-class treatments,"" she said. When asked on the Andrew Marr Show why the NHS was failing to hit key waiting time targets, Mrs May blamed an increased in demand on health services. The 10-year plan, she added, was ""crucial"" for ensuring the ""sustainability"" of the NHS. Speaking to the BBC in June, Mrs May suggested funding for the plan would come from a combination of taxes and the so-called ""Brexit dividend"". However, during the summer, Commons Health and Social Care Committee chairwoman Sarah Wollaston described the idea of a Brexit dividend as ""tosh"". As healthcare policy is politically devolved, the plan only applies to the NHS in England but Mrs May said the other UK nations will be drawing up their own plans. Under the government's funding system they are getting an extra Â£4bn between them by 2023. The full details are not being unveiled until Monday when it will be released by NHS England. But Mrs May has outlined some of the key focuses. These include: Better mental health care, including round-the-clock advice from NHS 111 by 2023 and tailored services for young adults.  Currently once someone in care turns 18 they are thrust into the adult system, often when they are not ready Providing the best maternity care in the world by improving safety and providing greater mental health support for new parents. One in five new mothers struggles with mental health in the first year of her baby's life Greater control and choice in old age by expanding the use of personal budgets to allow people to decide what care they want, and greater support in the community so people do not end up in hospital Better prevention and detection of disease - cancer is expected to be a key focus with an ambition to increase the number of early detections from one in two cancers to three in four, which in turn will improve survival Increases in the NHS workforce - currently one in 11 posts is vacant Bringing the NHS into the digital age, including online GP booking, prescriptions management and health records The plan was promised during the summer when the government unveiled its funding settlement for the NHS. That set out the budget for the next five years and means by 2023 funding for the NHS will be Â£20bn a year more than it is now, once inflation is taken into account. That is the equivalent of annual ""real terms"" rises of close to 3.5% - about twice what the NHS has got since 2010. NHS England boss Simon Stevens has been in charge of drawing up the plan At the time, the prime minister said she wanted to ensure the money was used wisely and so asked NHS England boss Simon Stevens to draw up a long-term plan for the next decade. It was expected to be published in the autumn, but was delayed because of the government's troubles getting its Brexit plans agreed. The last time such a long-term vision was set out was in 2000 under Tony Blair. Understandably people want to see the full details before coming to firm conclusions. But the priority areas are being welcomed. Andy Bell, of the Centre for Mental Health, said the initiatives on mental health were much needed. He said: ""For too many young people, mental health support is offered too late, with too many restrictions and then they are forced to start again when they reach 18."" Mental health care is one of the priority areas Dame Donna Kinnair, of the Royal College of Nursing, said nurses shared the ambitions being set out. But she added the government needed to ""urgently address"" the staffing shortages if it was going to succeed. And Jennifer Dixon, chief executive of the Health Foundation think-tank, predicted fulfilling the pledges would be ""extremely tough"" because of the scale of staffing shortages, rising pressures and cuts to other parts of the wider health and care system. The Â£20bn promise just relates to the front-line NHS budget and so does not cover other elements such as social care and public health - at the end of last year it was announced the budget for these services, which includes smoking cessation and weight management, was being cut by over 4% in real terms next year. Ms Dixon said: ""Trade-offs are inevitable and these must be spelled out clearly so the public know what they can expect from the NHS."" There has been a fair bit of tension behind the scenes. The Treasury is understood to have wanted to tie the NHS down in terms of what it will achieve. One of the central bones of contention is thought to be how the NHS can tackle deficits and waiting times. Hospitals are struggling to balance their books and have seen a deterioration in the time patients wait in A&E, for cancer and for routine operations. None of these three key waiting time targets are currently being met. The NHS is missing its key waiting time targets It looks like a trajectory for improvement will be published at a later date with NHS bosses known to have been wary about promising things they felt they could not deliver. Another missing piece is the green paper on social care. This was first promised in 2017, but has been delayed on a number of occasions. Brexit has certainly been a factor, but again there has been disagreements in private, this time over how radical the plan should be given the problems facing the sector, which covers care homes and home help. The government has promised the green paper will be published as soon as possible.

"British overseas territories and Crown dependencies will be able to design and mint their own version of the UK's new Â£1 coin, the Treasury has announced. The 12-sided coin was billed as ""the most secure coin in the world"" when it was introduced in 2017. Its original designs featured the Northern Irish shamrock, Welsh leek, Scottish thistle and English rose. But now the Crown dependencies, such as Jersey and overseas territories will be able to commission designs. The Treasury, which oversees the Royal Mint (based in Llantrisant, south Wales) said the move would underline the close links between the UK and its territories. Many of those territories have coins based on older versions of the Â£1 coin, which became increasingly vulnerable to sophisticated forgeries. New Â£1 coin's 'hidden' security feature All you need to know about new Â£1 coins The newer coin's security features include an image that works like a hologram, and micro-sized lettering inside both rims. The government said its territories would now have the option to produce their own 12-sided coin using the cutting-edge technology to protect their cash. It added that the new versions of the coin would be expected to feature images celebrating the heritage of the territories, with their history and culture pictured on the reverse side. Crown dependencies of the UK are the Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey, while the UK overseas territories include the likes of the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, the Falklands and Gibraltar.

"Rear Admiral Kevin Sweeney is the third senior Pentagon official to resign in recent weeks Department of Defence chief of staff Kevin Sweeney has resigned, a month after the Defence Secretary James Mattis announced his departure. Rear Admiral Sweeney said in a statement,externalthat ""the time is right to return to the private sector"". He is now the third senior Pentagon official to announce his resignation since President Donald Trump announced  US forces would leave Syria. Officials have said there is no timetable for the troop departure. Rear Adm Sweeney held his post for two years from January 2017. Trump's erratic foreign policy course The end of Trump's love affair with generals? In a terse resignation letter, he said it had been ""an honour to serve"" alongside his colleagues in the department, but made no mention of Mr Trump. His announcement comes days after General Mattis left his post early, after initially planning to stay in his role until February. His departure adds to a sense of uncertainty surrounding the Trump administration's defence and foreign policies since the surprise announcement of the planned withdrawal from Syria, analysts say. On Tuesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will embark on a week-long tour of the Middle East designed to reassure allies in the region. General Mattis announced his resignation in December The former defence secretary hinted at policy differences with President Trump in his resignation letter. James Mattis' resignation letter in full Addressed to Mr Trump directly, Gen Mattis's letter described his views on ""treating allies with respect"" and using ""all the tools of American power to provide for the common defence"". ""Because you have the right to have a secretary of defence whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects, I believe it is right for me to step down from my position,"" he wrote. Department spokeswoman Dana White also left her post after the president's surprise announcement on Syria, as did Brett McGurk, the presidential special envoy to the global coalition fighting so-called Islamic State.

"Lee Pomeroy, 51, was killed in front of his 14-year-old son Police have been given more time to question a man and woman arrested over the killing of Lee Pomeroy on a train. A 35-year-old suspect was held after a manhunt led police to a flat in Farnham, Surrey, in the early hours of Saturday morning. British Transport Police said they had been given another 12 hours to question the man and woman, 27, who is accused of assisting an offender. Mr Pomery was with his son when he was stabbed to death on Friday afternoon.

The 10-year plan, she added, was ""crucial"" for ensuring the ""sustainability"" of the NHS. Speaking to the BBC in June, Mrs May suggested funding for the plan would come from a combination of taxes and the so-called ""Brexit dividend"". However, during the summer, Commons Health and Social Care Committee chairwoman Sarah Wollaston described the idea of a Brexit dividend as ""tosh"". As healthcare policy is politically devolved, the plan only applies to the NHS in England but Mrs May said the other UK nations will be drawing up their own plans. Under the government's funding system they are getting an extra Â£4bn between them by 2023. The full details are not being unveiled until Monday when it will be released by NHS England. But Mrs May has outlined some of the key focuses. These include: Better mental health care, including round-the-clock advice from NHS 111 by 2023 and tailored services for young adults.  Currently once someone in care turns 18 they are thrust into the adult system, often when they are not ready Providing the best maternity care in the world by improving safety and providing greater mental health support for new parents. One in five new mothers struggles with mental health in the first year of her baby's life Greater control and choice in old age by expanding the use of personal budgets to allow people to decide what care they want, and greater support in the community so people do not end up in hospital Better prevention and detection of disease - cancer is expected to be a key focus with an ambition to increase the number of early detections from one in two cancers to three in four, which in turn will improve survival Increases in the NHS workforce - currently one in 11 posts is vacant Bringing the NHS into the digital age, including online GP booking, prescriptions management and health records The plan was promised during the summer when the government unveiled its funding settlement for the NHS. That set out the budget for the next five years and means by 2023 funding for the NHS will be Â£20bn a year more than it is now, once inflation is taken into account. That is the equivalent of annual ""real terms"" rises of close to 3.5% - about twice what the NHS has got since 2010. NHS England boss Simon Stevens has been in charge of drawing up the plan At the time, the prime minister said she wanted to ensure the money was used wisely and so asked NHS England boss Simon Stevens to draw up a long-term plan for the next decade. It was expected to be published in the autumn, but was delayed because of the government's troubles getting its Brexit plans agreed. The last time such a long-term vision was set out was in 2000 under Tony Blair. Understandably people want to see the full details before coming to firm conclusions. But the priority areas are being welcomed. Andy Bell, of the Centre for Mental Health, said the initiatives on mental health were much needed. He said: ""For too many young people, mental health support is offered too late, with too many restrictions and then they are forced to start again when they reach 18."" Mental health care is one of the priority areas Dame Donna Kinnair, of the Royal College of Nursing, said nurses shared the ambitions being set out. But she added the government needed to ""urgently address"" the staffing shortages if it was going to succeed. And Jennifer Dixon, chief executive of the Health Foundation think-tank, predicted fulfilling the pledges would be ""extremely tough"" because of the scale of staffing shortages, rising pressures and cuts to other parts of the wider health and care system. The Â£20bn promise just relates to the front-line NHS budget and so does not cover other elements such as social care and public health - at the end of last year it was announced the budget for these services, which includes smoking cessation and weight management, was being cut by over 4% in real terms next year. Ms Dixon said: ""Trade-offs are inevitable and these must be spelled out clearly so the public know what they can expect from the NHS."" There has been a fair bit of tension behind the scenes. The Treasury is understood to have wanted to tie the NHS down in terms of what it will achieve. One of the central bones of contention is thought to be how the NHS can tackle deficits and waiting times. Hospitals are struggling to balance their books and have seen a deterioration in the time patients wait in A&E, for cancer and for routine operations. None of these three key waiting time targets are currently being met. The NHS is missing its key waiting time targets It looks like a trajectory for improvement will be published at a later date with NHS bosses known to have been wary about promising things they felt they could not deliver. Another missing piece is the green paper on social care. This was first promised in 2017, but has been delayed on a number of occasions. Brexit has certainly been a factor, but again there has been disagreements in private, this time over how radical the plan should be given the problems facing the sector, which covers care homes and home help. The government has promised the green paper will be published as soon as possible.

"This video can not be played Theresa May: ""The danger... is we actually end up with no Brexit at all"" Theresa May has warned the UK faces ""uncharted territory"" if Parliament rejects her Brexit deal as she vowed to redouble her efforts to win MPs round. Next week's vote would ""definitely"" go ahead, she told the BBC, as she promised new safeguards for Northern Ireland and to look at giving MPs more say in shaping future EU negotiations. The UK's March exit was ""in danger"" if MPs did not back the deal, she said. But one Tory Brexiteer said support for leaving without a deal was ""hardening"". And one senior Labour figure said she believed a general election may be inevitable ""within months"" if there was deadlock in Parliament and Mrs May could not get her deal through. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. A deal on the terms of the UK's divorce and the framework of future relations has been agreed between the prime minister and the EU - but it needs to pass a vote by MPs in Parliament before it is accepted. MPs are expected to be asked to vote on it on either the 14 or 15 of January. Can Theresa May unblock her Brexit deal? Brexit vote: What could happen next? A really simple guide to Brexit Could Channel Ports cope with no deal? The crunch vote was due to take place in December but was postponed at the last minute as Mrs May faced almost certain defeat amid opposition from many of her MPs, as well as Labour and other parties. Asked by the BBC's Andrew Marr if the vote would ""definitely"" go ahead in the second week of January, she replied ""yes, we are going to hold the vote"". She said she truly believed hers was a ""good deal"" for the country and that it was up to its opponents to spell out the alternatives to it. This video can not be played Theresa May on Brexit vote timing and her political future Asked what had changed since last month, she said the EU had agreed to some ""changes"" and she was continuing to talk to European leaders as she tried to give MPs the ""confidence"" to support the deal. She promised to give more detail in three areas in the coming days: Specific measures for Northern Ireland A greater role for Parliament in negotiations on the next stage of future UK-EU relations Further assurances from the EU to address concerns over the Irish border backstop She said there were a ""number of ways"" of giving MPs more input in the next phase of the Brexit process, including allowing them a real say in shaping the ""mandate for the negotiations for the future relationship"". Mrs May suggested that if her deal was rejected it would embolden both supporters of a no-deal exit and those who want to remain in the EU via another referendum. Please upgrade your browser ""If the deal is not voted on, then we are going to be in uncharted territory,"" she said. ""I don't think anyone can say what will happen in terms of the reaction we see in Parliament. ""What you have is a Labour leadership... which is opposing any deal to create the greatest chaos possible, people who are promoting a second referendum in order to stop Brexit and people who want to see their perfect Brexit... the danger there is we end up with no Brexit at all."" Asked whether she was prepared to stand down as PM and let someone else take over talks over the future relations if Tory MPs demanded it, Mrs May - who survived a vote of no confidence last month - said the party had made it clear they wanted her to ""deliver on Brexit and that is what I am working on doing"". However, the DUP, which props up the government, said the fundamental problems with Mrs May's deal had not changed. Deputy leader Nigel Dodds said: ""The backstop remains the poison which makes any vote for the withdrawal agreement so toxic."" The backstop is a position of last resort, to maintain an open border on the island of Ireland in the event that the UK leaves the EU without securing an all-encompassing deal. Many Conservative MPs continue to believe the deal does not represent the Brexit the country voted for in 2016. Peter Bone told Sky News the best way to ""get on"" with Brexit was to leave without a deal, ""If there has been a change it is a hardening of attitudes among MPs to a no deal,"" he told Sophy Ridge, adding that there was increasing evidence that a no deal outcome was ""absolutely OK"". And a succession of other Tory Brexiteers have taken to social media to say ""nothing has changed"" during the Christmas recess and they remain opposed to the deal. Allow Twitter content?

But opponents of a no-deal exit have given notice they are determined to effectively rule the prospect out. A cross-party group of Conservative, Labour and Lib Dem MPs are proposing amending the government's Finance Bill, to be debated on Tuesday, so that ministers would only be able to make tax changes in the event of a no-deal exit if Parliament had explicitly authorised them. Labour MP Yvette Cooper said if the government ""would not rule out no deal, Parliament must act"". As part of the government's preparations for a no-deal Brexit, the company Seaborne Freight had been given a contract to run a freight service between Ramsgate and Ostend in the event of the UK leaving the EU without a deal.

By political correspondent Nick Eardley A new year is about to start at Westminster, but the political battleground feels very familiar. The PM's message hasn't changed. She still thinks her deal is only one that delivers and rejecting it would lead to uncharted territory. That's a warning to both sides; those who want another referendum could end up with no deal; those who want no deal could end up with no Brexit at all. Her critics, though, don't appear to have had any New Year changes of heart either. The DUP and many Tories are still unhappy and as things stand won't back her. Theresa May is promising to try and win more reassurances from Brussels. But for now it remains hard to see what she could secure that would win enough support for her to win the meaningful vote. This video can not be played Jon Ashworth: ""We're not enabling Brexit. This country had a referendum"" A poll of more than 25,000 Britons published on Sunday suggests Labour would be punished by voters if the party either ends up backing the government's deal or does not actively oppose it. The YouGov poll, carried out for the People's Vote campaign which is demanding another referendum, suggests 75% of Labour supporters would prefer a final say on Brexit. But the Labour leadership rejected claims that they were ""enabling"" Brexit by refusing, at this stage, to explicitly call for another referendum. Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry said the People's Vote campaign should focus on ""changing people's minds"" about whether to stay in the EU rather ""smacking Labour around the head"". She told the BBC that Labour's focus was getting into power in a general election she now expected to take place ""within months"" ""If you are a government that does not have the support of Parliament and does not have the support of the people, you cannot drive us over a cliff and think you are going to get away with it,"" she told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend. ""Our democracy is about whether you have the permission of the public and... whether you can justify what you are doing to our country."" Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said another referendum was the ""least worst option"", but he added that ""it was going to be very messy whatever happens"".

"The government's new flagship benefits system - universal credit - is causing ""unacceptable hardship"" for many of the claimants it was meant to help,a committee of MPs has said.,external The universal credit system has been made less generous since it was announced eight years ago and there are concerns 3.2 million working families could lose Â£48 a week - about Â£2,500 a year - compared with the old system. Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey has indicated there could bemore cash announced for the welfare system in the Autumn Budget on Monday. So will you be affected by the move to universal credit? And if so, by how much? Universal credit is a single monthly payment for people on a low income or who are out of work. It replaces some of the benefits and tax credits you might be getting now. Universal credit will replace these - referred to by the government as ""legacy benefits"": working tax credit child tax credit income-based jobseeker's allowance income support income-related employment and support allowance housing benefit While the system, first introduced in 2013, was supposed to be up and running by April 2017, it is now not expected to be fully operational until December 2023. Currently being phased in across the UK, it aims to make the benefits system simpler and more flexible - so people who are able to work are rewarded for doing so. However, it has been criticised for running over budget, causing delays to people's payments and in some cases making people worse off. By June this year, 883,000 claimants were receiving universal credit. This is about 13% of the total caseload expected when all claimants are migrated from legacy benefits. Birmingham, Croydon, Manchester, Southwark and Newcastle upon Tyne had the largest numbers of claimants at that point - between 14,000 and 33,000 in each area. Esther McVey has admitted that some working families could lose Â£200 a month as a consequence of the introduction of universal credit. But she said the most vulnerable would be protected, and people could take on more work to increase their income. Universal credit rollout delayed yet again What is universal credit - and what's the problem? In reality, whether you will be better or worse off under the new system will depend on your family and household circumstances. According to the Resolution Foundation think-tank,2.2 million families are expected to gain under universal credit, with an average increase in income of Â£41 a week.,external However, 3.2 million families are also expected to be worse off, with an average loss of Â£48 a week. The Resolution Foundation's analysis suggests the net impact on couples with children will be broadly neutral. Slightly fewer couples with children will gain (one million) than lose (1.1 million). The average gain of Â£54 a week compares to an average loss of Â£53 a week. However, the story for single parents is very different. Overall, they will lose by an average of Â£26 a week - but almost twice as many will lose (0.7 million) as will gain (0.4 million). But even within these different groups of gainers and losers, there are a wide range of outcomes, the latest Resolution Foundation's analysis suggests. The most common gains and losses for families will fall somewhere between Â£25 and Â£75 a week. For some, the gains or losses will exceed Â£100 a week, analysts say. The following hypothetical case studies of families, produced by the Resolution Foundation, give an example of how very different the impact of universal credit could be for different families with differing work statuses. In addition, whether families rent or own their own home will have an impact on whether they gain or lose. Renters are far more likely than homeowners to gain, according to the Resolution Foundation. Of the total 3.2m losers, 2.5 are homeowners. Of the 2.2m gainers, 1.6m are renters. Separate analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies conducted in 2016,found a similar pattern of winners and losers to the Resolution Foundation.,external IFS researchers found that the winners, on average, would be single-earner couples with children. The losers, on average, would be everyone else. Since the IFS analysis two years ago, universal credit has changed in certain ways not captured in their figures. However, researchers say the pattern of winners and losers remains broadly the same. Another thing to bear in mind is that benefits related to children are also changing. Under the old tax credits system, applicable in 2016-17, first-born children received Â£3,325 each year and subsequent children received Â£2,780. But as of April 2017 this changed. Newborn first children stopped receiving a higher entitlement and newborn third and subsequent children stopped receiving any support at all. Although this ""two-child limit"" imposed on tax credits is a change separate to the rollout of universal credit, universal credit will speed its implementation. As of November this year, any new claimants for universal credit will not receive any support for third and subsequent children, regardless of how old the children are. Because of these changes to child-related benefits,the IFS estimates that about 600,000 three-child families will lose an average of Â£2,500 a year,,externalwhile about 300,000 families with four or more children will lose Â£7,000 on average. Most of those affected families are in work. Claimants have experienced financial difficulties as a result of the move to the new system. In the the Department for Work and Pensions' (DWP) own survey of full-service claimants, published in June this year,four in 10 said they were experiencing problems keeping up with bills and credit commitments.,external A report by the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee, released on Friday, said universal credit was taking too long to pay people the money they needed and that the package of support to help them adjust was ""not fit for purpose"". The National Audit Office (NAO), which oversees government spending and assessed universal credit's progress earlier this year,said vulnerable groups had struggled with the move to the new system for a number of reasons.,external Claimants didn't have enough savings to last until their first payment was made, they had problems with monthly budgeting because of fluctuating universal credit payments, and they faced difficulties making and managing claims online, because of a lack of digital accessÂ and skills. The NAO reported how in three of the four areas it visited and for which data was available, the use of foodbanks had increased more rapidly where universal credit's full service had been rolled out. This corresponded with research by the Trussell Trust, which suggested upsurges of 30% in foodbank use in the six months after universal credit rolled out to an area, compared with 12% in non-universal credit areas. The NAO also found that local authorities, housing associations and landlords had seen an increase in rent arrears since universal credit's introduction. At one housing association looked at by the DWP, average rent arrears increased as claimants waited a month for their first payment. On average this started to plateau 10 to 12 weeks following a claim, when people started to repay their debts. Responding to these issues, the DWP announced that from April 2018 those already on housing benefit would continue to receive their award for the first two weeks of their universal credit claim to ease the transition to the new system. It is not yet known what impact this has had. This week, a group of single mothers also told the House of Commons Work and Pensions Committee how the new system was putting them at risk of debt because they had to pay childcare costs upfront and wait as long as six weeks to get reimbursed. Vikki Waterman, 34, who has two young daughters, said she had to pay Â£1,300 for childcare before she returned to work, which the universal credit system took five weeks to repay. ""We want to be able to go to work and to provide for our own families, and at the minute it seems as if there is a roadblock everywhere we turn,"" she told MPs. The government is facing growing calls from Conservative MPs - including the architect of the system Iain Duncan Smith - to scrap a promised income tax cut and instead pump more more money into universal credit. Former Prime MinisterJohn Major has likened the system to the hated poll tax- the policy that helped end Margaret Thatcher's time in Downing Street. Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable, part of the coalition team that launched the welfare programme, has also argued that a Â£5bn cash injection is required to ensure the system reaches its original aims of encouraging more people into work and simplifying the system. But the DWP insists universal credit is working and that people are moving into work faster and staying in work longer than under the old system. It says the programme willincrease the number of people in work by around 200,000 and bring in a Â£34bn return over 10 years.,external However, the NAOsaid in its report that both these benefits were impossible to prove at this stage.,external Prime Minister Theresa May defended the system in Parliament on Wednesday, saying there was Â£3.1bn set aside for additional support for people transitioning to the new system. ""We are not replicating the old system, because the old system did not work,"" she told MPs. ""This is a system that helps people into work and makes sure work pays."" Esther McVey has reportedly raised concerns with ministers about funding ahead of the Budget next week.

"There is a growing feeling it may take more than one go to get the deal through Parliament When Theresa May pulled the ""meaningful vote"" on Brexit last month, the day before MPs were about to pass their verdict on her deal, Downing Street hoped two things would happen. First, that the EU would offer some form of legal guarantee that the Northern Irish backstop - the arrangements for avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland - would be temporary. This, in turn, would bring the DUP on board - and unlock further support from previously hostile Conservative backbenchers. Second, that some sceptical MPs, once away from the febrile atmosphere at Westminster, would quietly reflect over Christmas that the deal wasn't as bad as all that, as it at least guarantees that the UK will leave the EU at the end of March. So perhaps any rebellion would diminish, if not evaporate. But neither hope has - yet - been realised, with the vote now less than two weeks away. So as things stand, the prime minister is once again facing defeat. But her difficulties could run even deeper than assumed. It was undoubtedly disappointing for Downing Street that the DUP's Westminster leader Nigel Dodds declared that the Withdrawal Agreement ""flies in the face"" of the government's commitments on Northern Ireland following his meetings with Theresa May and the Conservative chief whip Julian Smith this week. 'No way' DUP will back Brexit deal Varadkar and Merkel 'stand by' Brexit deal No-deal Brexit 'biggest threat' to unis The government quite simply couldn't tell him that that the EU, at this stage, was willing to go any further than offering ""reassurances"" and ""clarifications"" on the temporary nature of the backstop, rather than legal guarantees. But even if the EU does move significantly in the next ten days, the prime minister could still be facing defeat. What the DUP's Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Friday was significant. He said he was ""alarmed"" that the Northern Irish backstop could become the ""settled arrangement"" on Brexit. Let's unpick this for a moment - because it goes to the core of Theresa May's difficulties. The DUP want to make sure the backstop is temporary and that the UK, including Northern Ireland, can exit from it without EU approval. The European Commission has said the deal can't be re-negotiated but the talking continues If the EU can guarantee this, it's possible the DUP's MPs may grit their teeth and back - or abstain on - the deal, as would some long-standing Leave campaigners on the Conservative benches. But, as I understand it, up to 40 Conservative MPs still wouldn't back the deal because they, like Sammy Wilson, are worried about what the ""settled arrangement"" on Brexit might look like. They believe that the way the government will avoid a hard border in Ireland - and avoid triggering the backstop - is by agreeing a permanent trade deal that actually looks a lot like the backstop in any case. That is, the whole of the UK, not just Northern Ireland, would mirror some EU regulations on goods and stay close to the EU's customs arrangements. This would, they fear, then constrain the UK's ability to do future trade deals with the rest of the world. This suspicion is fuelled by the following words in the political declaration document - the blueprint for the post-Brexit relationship with the EU: ""The economic partnership should ensureâ¦.ambitious customs arrangements that.. build and improve on the single customs territory provided for in the Withdrawal Agreement."" Downing Street officials have pointed out - until they are almost blue in the face - that the political declaration also specifically mentions an ""independent trade policy"" for the UK. But this doesn't appear to have neutralised some backbench concerns. The prime minister will launch a ""charm offensive"" with Conservative MPs next week to try to allay any suspicions - though whether they will be charmed or offended is still an open question. Such is the lack of trust amongst a small but potentially crucial contingent of her MPs, I am told that in order for them to vote for her deal, she would need to convince them that she wouldn't handle the future trade negotiations after Brexit. Despite Chief Whip Julian Smith's efforts, many Tory MPs remained opposed to the deal And/or give them a firm date for her departure from office. Downing Street - and more widely, the government's - tactic is to raise the possibility of No Brexit unless long-standing Leave campaigners hold their noses and vote for her deal. This process has already begun. But expect it to be ramped up next week. The PM's allies will argue that unless the deal is settled soon, then opponents of Brexit and supporters of a new referendum will try to amend forthcoming non-Brexit legislation to make it contingent on a public vote taking place. And MPs who don't want a referendum but do want Theresa May's deal fundamentally renegotiated will be told that would mean extending Article 50 and therefore, in No 10's eyes, breaking faith with leave-supporting voters. So far these arguments don't seem to have worked. Some of her MPs will doubtlessly be poring over a YouGov survey published today. This was commissioned by London's Queen Mary University and Sussex University as part of a wider project into party members' attitudes and views. It suggested more than half of Conservative members - 53% - believe Mrs May's deal doesn't respect the result of the referendum. And 59% of them oppose her deal, while 38% support it. No 10 would argue that there is private polling which suggests her deal is more popular with the wider public. The You Gov survey itself suggests that 46% of likely Conservative voters (as opposed to members) back the deal, with a smaller number - 38% -opposing. There is another potential fly in the ointment for the prime minister - although here, adversity could be turned to advantage. It is assumed that the Lords will insert an amendment in to legislation on trade which would require the prime minister to negotiate a customs union with the EU. Please upgrade your browser The government, in the normal run of things, would then vote this change down when the legislation returns to the Commons. But with Labour formally backing a customs union - and some Conservative MPs who backed Remain in the referendum also very warm to the idea - government sources are concerned that the Commons might not overturn it. So the argument that is likely to be made by government whips to the Brexiteer opponents of Theresa May's deal is this: Unless they grab the prime minister's deal before the trade legislation comes to the Commons, they might be landed with a customs union. And this wouldn't just constrain, but prevent, future independent trade deals. It may look chaotic but one government insider says the key is making steady progress But the most likely option for at least reducing the size of any defeat on the deal is further movement from Brussels. The prime minister is talking the EU Commission President Jean Claude Juncker later and I am told she will be talking to other EU 27 leaders over the next ten days. There is a feeling in Whitehall that it may take more than one attempt to get the deal through parliament. One government insider likened the prime minister's situation to a game of American football. Things can look chaotic at any given moment but as long as you don't give the ball away to your opponents you can move incrementally towards your goal. But she has already had to make one backward pass - delaying the vote on her deal - and may need some trick play to get her deal over the line. As MPs return to parliament next week, the prospect of a prime ministerial victory appears some way off.

"Donald Trump said the wall could be made of steel, rather than concrete President Donald Trump has refused to compromise on his demand for a wall to be built on the Mexican border, the cause of a partial government shutdown. He said he did not think he would have to reduce the $5.6bn (Â£4.4bn) in funds he was demanding and repeated a threat to declare a national emergency. His new chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said earlier he expected the shutdown to ""drag on a lot longer"". Democrats refuse to back the funding, calling the wall ""immoral"". Talks to end the partial shutdown will resume later on Sunday, with the stalemate now in its third week, affecting some 800,000 federal workers. #ShutdownStories: The impact of the government shutdown How women are changing the face of Congress The wall was one of Mr Trump's key campaign pledges and he had said Mexico would pay for it, something Mexico has never agreed to. He was speaking as he left the White House for Camp David, where he will discuss policy issues with aides. ""We have to build the wall,"" he said. ""It's about safety, it's about security for our country... We have no choice... it's a very important battle to win."" Mr Trump said he thought the Democrats ""want a deal"", adding: ""The shutdown could end tomorrow or go on a long time. It really depends on the Democrats."" But he also repeated an earlier threat to declare a national emergency ""depending on what happens in the next few days"". Mick Mulvaney: ""I think this is going to drag on a lot longer"" US law allows him to direct military construction projects under those circumstances but the money would have to come from defence department funds and there would inevitably be legal challenges by the Democrats that would drag out the matter. Mr Trump also repeated the idea of building the wall out of ""steel instead of concrete"", presumably in the hope that Democrats could then claim it was not a wall. The idea has not gained traction with the Democrats so far. Mr Mulvaney told NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday that he thought the controversy was ""going to drag on a lot longer. I think that's... by intention"". He did not elaborate. The talks between the Democrats and Republicans on the shutdown will resume on Sunday afternoon. Both sides believe their core support backs their stance, so leeway is limited. A Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll suggested 50% blamed the president for the shutdown, while 32% saw the Democratic Party as culpable. Democrats House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer walk out of the West Wing One idea that has been floated, reportedly by Trump adviser Jared Kushner at the meeting on Saturday, was to give the Democrats new measures on young immigrants called ""Dreamers"", in exchange for the wall funding. Dreamers are immigrants who illegally entered the US as children. Democrats want to ensure that they are shielded from deportation but have refused to link the issue with a deal on wall funding. Some conservatives are also reportedly alarmed at any offer on the Dreamers. Ms Pelosi said after the failed talks on Saturday her party would introduce piecemeal bills aimed at reopening certain government agencies, starting with the Internal Revenue Service and the Treasury Department. ""This action is necessary so that the American people can receive their tax refunds on schedule,"" she said. The bills may amount to little more than extra pressure on the president. Partial shutdowns occur when Congress cannot agree a budget by a certain deadline or the president refuses to sign it. That happened on 22 December and a quarter of the government has been closed since, leaving some 800,000 workers either furloughed - a kind of temporary leave of absence - or working without pay. The Senate had actually reached bipartisan agreement on a budget but Mr Trump then refused to back it, demanding the funding for the wall. This video can not be played The return of the woman Republicans love to hate The House then passed a bill including funding for the wall, when the Republicans still had a majority there, but they could not get the necessary 60 votes in the 100-seat Senate. When the Democrats took control of the new Congress this week, they passed spending bills to reopen the government. The leader of the Republican-controlled Senate, Mitch McConnell, immediately called the move ""a time-wasting act of political posturing"". In Friday's news conference, Mr Trump told reporters he might consider asking his cabinet to decline a $10,000 pay rise that is due to take effect because a pay freeze has expired as an inadvertent result of the shutdown. Unpaid workers are clearly feeling the pinch. Transport Security Administration employee Brian Turner told the BBC he might have to look for another job if the shutdown continued. ""We have a five-month-old son so we have about a month left before we're going to have to start having those difficult conversations about what to do next,"" he said. Many workers, but by no means all, are likely to get back pay when the shutdown is resolved. Food and Drug Administration commissioner Scott Gottlieb said on Saturday his agency had only  a month's funding left for some of its activities. The shutdown means: About 25% of the US federal government has no funding Nine departments have been affected, including Homeland Security, Justice, Housing, Agriculture, Commerce, Interior, and the Treasury Native American tribes who receive substantial federal funding are struggling National Parks have become hazardous without staff Are you a federal employee or contractor affected by the government shutdown?

"Sumire Nakamura told a press conference: ""I'm happy when I win"" A Japanese schoolgirl is set to become the youngest professional player of the board game Go. Sumire Nakamura will be 10 when she enters the lowest professional rank of the game on 1 April. She began playing the complicated strategy game at the age of three and was competing in national tournaments in Japan by the time she was seven. The previous record was set by Rina Fujisawa, who was 11 when she became a professional player in 2010. Go player to take on Chinese AI Google's AI wins final Go challenge Facebook trains AI to beat humans at Go ""I'm happy when I win,"" the Osaka schoolgirl told a press conference in Tokyo on Saturday.  ""I want to have a title while being in junior high school."" The Japan Go Association has chosen her to take part in a programme training young players to compete with Chinese and Korean players in international tournaments. Her father, Shinya Nakamura, is also a professional player and won a national title in 1998. This video can not be played A brief guide to Go Go is thought to have originated in China several thousand years ago and is widely played in East Asian countries. It is a game of two players who take turns putting black or white stones on a 19-by-19 grid. Players win by taking control of the most territory on the board, which they achieve by surrounding their opponent's pieces with their own. The rules are simpler than those of chess, but a player typically has a choice of 200 moves, compared with about 20 in chess. It can be very difficult to determine who is winning, and many of the top human players rely on instinct.

"This video can not be played Theresa May: ""The danger... is we actually end up with no Brexit at all"" Theresa May has warned the UK faces ""uncharted territory"" if Parliament rejects her Brexit deal as she vowed to redouble her efforts to win MPs round. Next week's vote would ""definitely"" go ahead, she told the BBC, as she promised new safeguards for Northern Ireland and to look at giving MPs more say in shaping future EU negotiations. The UK's March exit was ""in danger"" if MPs did not back the deal, she said. But one Tory Brexiteer said support for leaving without a deal was ""hardening"". And one senior Labour figure said she believed a general election may be inevitable ""within months"" if there was deadlock in Parliament and Mrs May could not get her deal through. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. A deal on the terms of the UK's divorce and the framework of future relations has been agreed between the prime minister and the EU - but it needs to pass a vote by MPs in Parliament before it is accepted. MPs are expected to be asked to vote on it on either the 14 or 15 of January. Can Theresa May unblock her Brexit deal? Brexit vote: What could happen next? A really simple guide to Brexit Could Channel Ports cope with no deal? The crunch vote was due to take place in December but was postponed at the last minute as Mrs May faced almost certain defeat amid opposition from many of her MPs, as well as Labour and other parties. Asked by the BBC's Andrew Marr if the vote would ""definitely"" go ahead in the second week of January, she replied ""yes, we are going to hold the vote"". She said she truly believed hers was a ""good deal"" for the country and that it was up to its opponents to spell out the alternatives to it. This video can not be played Theresa May on Brexit vote timing and her political future Asked what had changed since last month, she said the EU had agreed to some ""changes"" and she was continuing to talk to European leaders as she tried to give MPs the ""confidence"" to support the deal. She promised to give more detail in three areas in the coming days: Specific measures for Northern Ireland A greater role for Parliament in negotiations on the next stage of future UK-EU relations Further assurances from the EU to address concerns over the Irish border backstop She said there were a ""number of ways"" of giving MPs more input in the next phase of the Brexit process, including allowing them a real say in shaping the ""mandate for the negotiations for the future relationship"". Mrs May suggested that if her deal was rejected it would embolden both supporters of a no-deal exit and those who want to remain in the EU via another referendum. Please upgrade your browser ""If the deal is not voted on, then we are going to be in uncharted territory,"" she said. ""I don't think anyone can say what will happen in terms of the reaction we see in Parliament. ""What you have is a Labour leadership... which is opposing any deal to create the greatest chaos possible, people who are promoting a second referendum in order to stop Brexit and people who want to see their perfect Brexit... the danger there is we end up with no Brexit at all."" Asked whether she was prepared to stand down as PM and let someone else take over talks over the future relations if Tory MPs demanded it, Mrs May - who survived a vote of no confidence last month - said the party had made it clear they wanted her to ""deliver on Brexit and that is what I am working on doing"". However, the DUP, which props up the government, said the fundamental problems with Mrs May's deal had not changed. Deputy leader Nigel Dodds said: ""The backstop remains the poison which makes any vote for the withdrawal agreement so toxic."" The backstop is a position of last resort, to maintain an open border on the island of Ireland in the event that the UK leaves the EU without securing an all-encompassing deal. Many Conservative MPs continue to believe the deal does not represent the Brexit the country voted for in 2016. Peter Bone told Sky News the best way to ""get on"" with Brexit was to leave without a deal, ""If there has been a change it is a hardening of attitudes among MPs to a no deal,"" he told Sophy Ridge, adding that there was increasing evidence that a no deal outcome was ""absolutely OK"". And a succession of other Tory Brexiteers have taken to social media to say ""nothing has changed"" during the Christmas recess and they remain opposed to the deal. Allow Twitter content?

But opponents of a no-deal exit have given notice they are determined to effectively rule the prospect out. A cross-party group of Conservative, Labour and Lib Dem MPs are proposing amending the government's Finance Bill, to be debated on Tuesday, so that ministers would only be able to make tax changes in the event of a no-deal exit if Parliament had explicitly authorised them. Labour MP Yvette Cooper said if the government ""would not rule out no deal, Parliament must act"". As part of the government's preparations for a no-deal Brexit, the company Seaborne Freight had been given a contract to run a freight service between Ramsgate and Ostend in the event of the UK leaving the EU without a deal. However the councillor for the harbour area has saidthe Port of Ramsgate ""cannot be ready"" for extra ferry services should a no-deal Brexit happen. Allow Twitter content?

By political correspondent Nick Eardley A new year is about to start at Westminster, but the political battleground feels very familiar. The PM's message hasn't changed. She still thinks her deal is only one that delivers and rejecting it would lead to uncharted territory. That's a warning to both sides; those who want another referendum could end up with no deal; those who want no deal could end up with no Brexit at all. Her critics, though, don't appear to have had any New Year changes of heart either. The DUP and many Tories are still unhappy and as things stand won't back her. Theresa May is promising to try and win more reassurances from Brussels. But for now it remains hard to see what she could secure that would win enough support for her to win the meaningful vote. This video can not be played Jon Ashworth: ""We're not enabling Brexit. This country had a referendum"" A poll of more than 25,000 Britons published on Sunday suggests Labour would be punished by voters if the party either ends up backing the government's deal or does not actively oppose it. The YouGov poll, carried out for the People's Vote campaign which is demanding another referendum, suggests 75% of Labour supporters would prefer a final say on Brexit. But the Labour leadership rejected claims that they were ""enabling"" Brexit by refusing, at this stage, to explicitly call for another referendum. Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry said the People's Vote campaign should focus on ""changing people's minds"" about whether to stay in the EU rather ""smacking Labour around the head"". She told the BBC that Labour's focus was getting into power in a general election she now expected to take place ""within months"" ""If you are a government that does not have the support of Parliament and does not have the support of the people, you cannot drive us over a cliff and think you are going to get away with it,"" she told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend. ""Our democracy is about whether you have the permission of the public and... whether you can justify what you are doing to our country."" Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said another referendum was the ""least worst option"", but he added that ""it was going to be very messy whatever happens"".

"Security forces guarded streets approaching the church A policeman has been killed trying to defuse a bomb outside a Coptic Christian church in Egypt, security officials say. Mustafa Abid was reportedly a specialist in mine clearance. The explosion injured two other officers and an onlooker. The device was one of two hidden in a bag on a roof by the church in Nasr City outside Cairo. It comes two days before Egypt's Christians celebrate their Christmas. About 10% of Egypt's population are Copts, and many say the state discriminates against them and does not offer them enough protection. Egyptian President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi - who declares himself a defender of Christians against extremists - is due to open Cathedral of Nativity on Sunday outside the capital, the day before Coptic Christmas on 7 January. The new cathedral is set to open on Sunday at the new administrative capital east of Cairo No group has of yet claimed the attack, but Islamist insurgents have regularly attacked Copts in the past. More than 100 have been killed in attacks by jihadists since 2016. Last October,17 people were sentenced to death for their involvement in bomb attacks on Coptic churches. And the following month,police killed 19 Islamist militants who were accused of attacking Christians in a shoot-out. The Coptic Orthodox Church is the main Christian Church in Egypt. While most Copts live there, the church has about a million members outside the country. Copts believe that their faith dates back to about AD50, when the Apostle Mark is said to have visited Egypt. The head of the church is called the Pope, and is considered to be the successor of Saint Mark. This video can not be played Coptic Christians are a significant minority in Egypt The Coptic Church separated from other Christian denominations at the Council of Chalcedon in 451, in a dispute over the human and divine nature of Jesus Christ.

"Lee Pomeroy was killed in front of his 14-year-old son Relatives have paid tribute to ""devoted family man"" Lee Pomeroy, 51, who was stabbed to death on a train in Surrey. The married father of one from Guildford was on his way to London with his 14-year-old son for a day out. In a statement his family called the attack, the day before his birthday, ""horrific and pointless"". A man, aged 35, was arrested on suspicion of murder and a 27-year-old woman was arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender. The statement from the family on Saturday added: ""He was a devoted family man and did everything for his family. ""He was an honourable man and would always help somebody who was in trouble. ""Lee would have had his birthday today, but did not get to see his presents. ""He was an honest, bright person, who loved music very much, he knew history and art and he was a bachelor of science in maths."" Flowers at Horsley station for the 51-year-old father who was stabbed to death Mr Pomeroy and his attacker both got on the train at London Road station in Guildford at about 13:00 GMT. Det Ch Insp Sam Blackburn from British Transport Police, said: ""This is a fast moving investigation. ""We are now confident to say that this is not believed to be a random assault. ""In the moments leading to the violent killing, both men appeared to be involved in an altercation lasting three minutes. ""Nothing justified the extraordinary violence that followed and we are concentrating our efforts on the on-going investigation."" The suspect was arrest at about 06:00 on Saturday. Assistant Chief Constable Sean O'Callaghan told BBC Breakfast the two men had moved through a carriage having a discussion for a few minutes before the ""unprovoked violent attack"" which saw Mr Pomeroy stabbed multiple times. He said witness statements, support from other forces throughout the night and CCTV of the offence all led to the arrest. Officers are still appealing for witnesses to come forward, but Mr O'Callaghan said police were ""confident"" in the arrests they had made and were not seeking anybody else in connection with the attack.

Talks to end the partial shutdown will resume later on Sunday, with the stalemate now in its third week, affecting some 800,000 federal workers. #ShutdownStories: The impact of the government shutdown How women are changing the face of Congress The wall was one of Mr Trump's key campaign pledges and he had said Mexico would pay for it, something Mexico has never agreed to. He was speaking as he left the White House for Camp David, where he will discuss policy issues with aides. ""We have to build the wall,"" he said. ""It's about safety, it's about security for our country... We have no choice... it's a very important battle to win."" Mr Trump said he thought the Democrats ""want a deal"", adding: ""The shutdown could end tomorrow or go on a long time. It really depends on the Democrats."" But he also repeated an earlier threat to declare a national emergency ""depending on what happens in the next few days"". Mick Mulvaney: ""I think this is going to drag on a lot longer"" US law allows him to direct military construction projects under those circumstances but the money would have to come from defence department funds and there would inevitably be legal challenges by the Democrats that would drag out the matter. Mr Trump also repeated the idea of building the wall out of ""steel instead of concrete"", presumably in the hope that Democrats could then claim it was not a wall. The idea has not gained traction with the Democrats so far. Mr Mulvaney told NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday that he thought the controversy was ""going to drag on a lot longer. I think that's... by intention"". He did not elaborate. The talks between the Democrats and Republicans on the shutdown will resume on Sunday afternoon. Both sides believe their core support backs their stance, so leeway is limited. A Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll suggested 50% blamed the president for the shutdown, while 32% saw the Democratic Party as culpable. Democrats House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer walk out of the West Wing One idea that has been floated, reportedly by Trump adviser Jared Kushner at the meeting on Saturday, was to give the Democrats new measures on young immigrants called ""Dreamers"", in exchange for the wall funding. Dreamers are immigrants who illegally entered the US as children. Democrats want to ensure that they are shielded from deportation but have refused to link the issue with a deal on wall funding. Some conservatives are also reportedly alarmed at any offer on the Dreamers. Ms Pelosi said after the failed talks on Saturday her party would introduce piecemeal bills aimed at reopening certain government agencies, starting with the Internal Revenue Service and the Treasury Department. ""This action is necessary so that the American people can receive their tax refunds on schedule,"" she said. The bills may amount to little more than extra pressure on the president. Partial shutdowns occur when Congress cannot agree a budget by a certain deadline or the president refuses to sign it. That happened on 22 December and a quarter of the government has been closed since, leaving some 800,000 workers either furloughed - a kind of temporary leave of absence - or working without pay. The Senate had actually reached bipartisan agreement on a budget but Mr Trump then refused to back it, demanding the funding for the wall. This video can not be played The return of the woman Republicans love to hate The House then passed a bill including funding for the wall, when the Republicans still had a majority there, but they could not get the necessary 60 votes in the 100-seat Senate. When the Democrats took control of the new Congress this week, they passed spending bills to reopen the government. The leader of the Republican-controlled Senate, Mitch McConnell, immediately called the move ""a time-wasting act of political posturing"". In Friday's news conference, Mr Trump told reporters he might consider asking his cabinet to decline a $10,000 pay rise that is due to take effect because a pay freeze has expired as an inadvertent result of the shutdown. Unpaid workers are clearly feeling the pinch. Transport Security Administration employee Brian Turner told the BBC he might have to look for another job if the shutdown continued. ""We have a five-month-old son so we have about a month left before we're going to have to start having those difficult conversations about what to do next,"" he said. Many workers, but by no means all, are likely to get back pay when the shutdown is resolved. Food and Drug Administration commissioner Scott Gottlieb said on Saturday his agency had only  a month's funding left for some of its activities.

"Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd has said she would listen ""very carefully"" to concerns over universal credit The next stage of the universal credit rollout is to be scaled back amid concerns about the controversial new benefits system. MPs were due to vote on whether to move three million benefit claimants onto universal credit in the next few weeks. But this vote has been pushed back and Parliament will instead be asked to vote on transferring just 10,000 people to the new benefits system. Labour said ministers should halt the rollout ""as a matter of urgency"". But the government says all claimants will be on universal credit by 2023 as planned. Universal credit works bymerging six different benefits,externalfor working age people into one monthly payment. The single payment is paid directly into claimants' bank accounts, covering the benefits for which they are eligible. Supporters of the welfare reform, which is being introduced in stages across the UK, say it helps simplify the old complicated benefits system. The Department for Work and Pensions has said that, under universal credit people are moving into work faster and staying in work longer. 2.2 million families are expected to gain under the system,with an average increase in income of Â£41 a week according to analysis by the Resolution Foundation think tank. However the same analysis found that 3.2 million households could lose an average of Â£48 per week. Some people already claiming universal credit say it has forced them into destitution andin some cases prostitution.Others say they have been left torely on foodbanks. The rollout has also faced criticism for running over budget and is currently years behind schedule. Universal credit: Will benefit changes affect you? 'Do I buy food or Christmas presents for my son?' More than one million people are currently in receipt of universal credit - either new claimants for benefits or those who have had a change in circumstances, perhaps by moving house. The government's plan is for almost seven million people to be on universal credit by 2023. Ministers were due to seek Parliamentary approval to move three million existing welfare claimants onto the new benefit. But now Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd will seek approval for just 10,000 people to be moved onto universal credit in the summer. That process will then be assessed and further Parliamentary approval sought before every other existing welfare claimant is moved. A source close to Ms Rudd said the pause was the right thing to do, and should reassure Parliament that she was listening to MPs' concerns. This video can not be played Universal credit: Is the government's benefit system working? Prime Minister Theresa May told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show the new benefits system would be fully rolled out by 2023, as intended. She said the government was taking its time ""to get this right"", insisting that universal credit is a better system than the one it replaces. She added: ""The legacy system we inherited from the Labour Party had nearly 1.4 million people left on benefits for almost a decade. ""Helping people into work, giving them the dignity of being in work, the ability to support their families, that's what universal credit is about."" The news that the government was pushing back the votewas first reported in the Observer on Sunday,externalwhich quoted a Whitehall source as saying Ms Rudd wants a ""fresh Parliamentary mandate"" for the reform. Ms Rudd, speaking when she was first given the job of work and pensions secretary in November last year, said she would listen ""very carefully"" to concerns over universal credit and admitted the system ""can be better"". She added that she would ""learn from errors"" and ""adjust"" the system, which she said had problems, where needed. 'I'm living on nothing' Universal credit 'hits students harder' 'People are worried sick about universal credit' Labour's shadow work and pensions secretary Margaret Greenwood described universal credit as ""deeply flawed"" and called on the government to halt the rollout ""as a matter of urgency"". Former Labour MP Frank Field, work and pensions select committee chairman, told the Observer he welcomed Ms Rudd's decision to revisit the plans. He said: ""The government seems finally to have woken up to the human catastrophe that was waiting to happen under its ill-formed plans for moving people on to universal credit."" The government should proceed with ""managed migration"" of people to universal credit ""only once it has proved to parliament that it will not push more vulnerable people to the brink of destitution"", Mr Field added. The government has agreed on several occasions to slow the pace at which universal credit is extended across the UK. Ms Rudd's predecessor, Esther McVey, hadpromisedclaimants would be given more time to switch to the new benefit and they would not have to wait as long for their money. And in the 2018 Autumn Budget last month, Chancellor Philip Hammond pledged an extra Â£1bn over five years to help those moving to the new payments and a Â£1,000 increase in the amount people can earn before losing benefits, at a cost of up to Â£1.7bn a year. Universal credit is a benefit for working-age people. It replaces six benefits - income support, income-based jobseeker's allowance, income-related employment and support allowance, housing benefit, child tax credit and working tax credit - and merges them into one payment: It was designed to make claiming benefits simpler. A single universal credit payment is paid directly into claimants' bank accounts to cover the benefits for which they are eligible. Claimants then have to pay costs such as rent out of their universal credit payment (though there is a provision for people who are in rent arrears or have difficulty managing their money to have their rent paid directly to their landlord). Thelatest available figures,externalshow that there were 1.4 million universal credit claimants in November. Read more: What is universal credit? Universal Credit: Will benefit changes affect you?

"""Megan"" first met the sports coach in her early teens, and they began a secret ""relationship"" when she was 17 ""When I was 16, we started messaging a bit more and it wasn't just the sport. I was quite naive and vulnerable."" Megan - not her real name - says she was 17 when she first kissed her sports coach, an older man who had acted as a guardian on trips away and was someone her parents trusted ""implicitly"". While it is illegal for teachers and care workers to have sexual relations with 16 and 17-year-olds in their care, this does not apply to sports coaches. Campaigners want this to be changed. They have accused the UK government of ""backtracking"" onproposals announced in 2017to add coaches to the list of professions covered by the law designed to prevent the abuse of positions of trust. The Ministry of Justice said it continued to keep the law under review. Megan was in her early teens when she first met the man she later accused of taking advantage of her. As she began competing at a higher level she trained seven days a week. She said she often found herself unexpectedly alone during sessions with her coach. ""I thought everyone was having individual sessions but in fact it was just me. He told the others that training was cancelled so we could have training by ourselves,"" Megan said. She said her coach had her phone number to arrange training sessions and meetings. When she was 16 - the standard age of consent - he began asking her personal questions about her sex life. Megan said they kissed after a night out and had several more intimate encounters in his car when he gave her a lift, making her feel like they were ""in a relationship"". ""It was a secret so I felt like we had to delete all of our messages,"" she said. ""It didn't feel nice to keep it a secret because I felt like I was lying. There were a lot of feelings of guilt involved."" Megan said the relationship continued until she ""realised what a big age difference there was"" and broke it off. ""He's just got away with it... it was very upsetting"" 'Bold change' urged on rugby injury risks Gender stereotypes: Teen called lesbian for playing football Girls and women 'missing out' on benefits of sport She said she finally told her parents who were ""devastated"" and reported it to the police. The coach - who disputed her account and denied any wrongdoing - was arrested and bailed, but the matter was dropped by police as no criminal offence was deemed to have been committed. ""He's just got away with itâ¦ it was very upsetting,"" Megan added. Des Mannion, the national head of service for NSPCC Wales, said the law as it stands ""isn't adequate"". ""We know there are individuals who are wronged but have no redress,"" he said. Mr Mannion said he was calling for the UK government to introduce legislation to protect all children and young people, not just when they are in a classroom. ""We're talking about a power relationship where an older adult has a position of trust and power over a young person,"" he said. ""We know that individuals who have a sexual interest in children will seek positions of power and influence so they can offend against them."" Megan considered quitting her sport The Ministry of Justice said it remained ""absolutely committed to protecting children and young people from sexual abuse"". ""We already have a wide range of criminal offences under which to prosecute and sentence those who carry out such acts,"" a spokesman said. For Megan, the relationship left her feeling her beloved sport had been ""ruined"". She considered quitting but is working hard to get back on track.

"Buy less meat and dairy. Walk, don't drive. Dry laundry on a rack. They're all things we're told could help save the planet. But how far are any of us prepared to go? And what's stopping us from doing more? We challenged three people to spend one week making as many changes as possible to live a greener life. Here's how they got on. About:I'm a 25-year-old senior associate at a consultancy firm, who lives wherever my latest project is. Home is Fife but for the time being I'm living and working in Glasgow, which means I can get everywhere on foot. I like to cook from scratch and socialise with friends and my team. My week:I made a really conscious effort not to buy any meat or fish. Buying vegetarian or vegan food was not particularly tough but eating out was trickier when it looked so tempting - and I did eat a prawn curry at a restaurant. Avoiding cow's milk was not hard - I already drink soy milk, prefer my coffee black and recently discovered chocolate oat milk. I tried vegan parmesan for the first time, and was pleasantly surprised that it tasted like the real thing and even melts. Plant-based diets 'help combat global warming' I tried not to throw anything away (I froze spinach before it went off) and bought loose vegetables instead of pre-packaged bags. My biggest shift was checking where food was from. One day my blueberries were from Perth, Scotland, the next, from Peru. Yet both packets suggested they were produced locally. Even my ""seasonal"" butternut squash was from Spain. Once I started spending a few seconds (and that really is all it takes) checking the source, I felt more inclined to pick local. I watched documentaries including Mission Blue and Cowspiracy [about marine conservation and intensive farming, respectively], and started following Zanna Van Dijk and The Happy Pear [environmental/fitness and vegetarian/lifestyle bloggers] online for inspiration and information. My friends and I discussed how social media could inspire but also make you feel so far off the end goal - you've just bought a coffee in a reusable cup, then you read about fast-fashion and think: ""God, I've just bought this T-shirt."" I spoke to my consultant colleagues, who are in and out of hotels, about leaving big plastic bottles of toiletries in their office locker or at hotels over weekends to avoid buying mini ones each week. One told me how they can't recycle takeaway food packaging in hotels, so bring it to work to put in office recycling bins. In Glasgow, I walk everywhere but, in the past, my job has involved driving, flying, getting a train and a bus just to get to the office. Where possible though, we do use video conferencing with colleagues and clients. What I learned: Spot the difference? One pack's grown in Italy, the other in the UK Look at the labels - is it grown locally? Buy minimal, responsibly-sourced meat from the meat counter (less plastic packaging) Take baby steps to inform yourself Try vegan cheese - with an open mind Top tip:Buy a reusable coffee cup, water bottle and Tupperware - and actually use them. About:I'm a healthy history student who hits the gym four times a week and eats eggs and chicken to keep up my protein levels. I mainly travel around Manchester by bus or foot, and share a house - but not usually meals - with my flatmates. I'm 20, and grew up in a nature-loving family in Belgium where food was never thrown away and leftovers were always for tomorrow. My week:Living in the UK - where everything is easily available and students live in houses where rent includes bills - means people leave taps on, lights on and put the heating up as high as they want. It's a problem. Every day I turned the heating off or down to 18C. I also bought insulating tape to block out draughts in my bedroom. I made a conscious effort to have shorter showers and use less dishwater. I swapped bananas for stewed UK-grown pears on my breakfast, and bought soya milk for the first time in my life - but I wasn't convinced. Cow's milk just tastes better and we always buy milk communally for the flat. One night I made a vegan stew for my flatmates - all the vegetables were UK-grown except the butter beans and lentils. I'd never cooked for them all before and was scared I'd bottle it. But they all really liked it. I tried, unsuccessfully, to find a more environmentally-friendly shampoo, but they're Â£6-7, and I'd usually spend Â£3. But I did invest Â£20 in a menstrual cup to cut down on waste and save money (a woman spends an average Â£4,800 on period products in her lifetime, according to the charity Bloody Good Period). My flatmates thought it a bit gross but I found it was just as good once I got used to it. Why menstrual cups are becoming more popular How shampoo is harming the environment What I learned: It only takes three or four days before it becomes automatic to think: buy loose, buy British and take your own bag Food is ridiculously over-packaged. I think it's a British thing to wrap fruit in plastic and cardboard - you wouldn't see it in Belgium Don't put the heating on, put a jumper on To my surprise, I've become pretty much vegetarian since the challenge - I don't even buy chicken any more Top tip:Prepare meals at the start of the week to reduce plastic and food waste - and save money. About:I'm a 31-year-old primary school teacher living in Bicester, Oxfordshire, with my partner and 18-month-old boy. Since my son's birth, I'm giving more thought to the sort of world he - and my class of nine and 10-year-olds - will grow up in. My week:At home, I made lots of small, simple changes which quickly became routine. My son wears disposable nappies which we usually put in a plastic nappy bag before binning. Instead, we only bagged up soiled nappies. Instead of a deep bath, we gave my little boy a shower over the bath with a plug in, using less water and he still got to splash around and play with his ducks. He loved that. I like my dairy and meat too much to have made any dietary changes - and my son is struggling to eat at the moment, so we carried on as normal with food. However, I did take leftovers from the previous night's dinner to work in Tupperware. I turned off the tap when I was brushing my teeth - or brushed them while in the shower. I monitored the heating, which was rarely above 15C (our semi-detached is well-insulated) and charged my mobile phone before bedtime so it wasn't charging through the night. Designers create the 'impossible' zero-carbon house In the classroom, I talked about the changes I was making in my life and asked each of the children to make one change at home. Theirs included turning the light off when they left a room; using a torch or fairy lights to read by at bedtime; using reusable water bottles, and turning the TV off at the switch. About 80% stuck to it for the whole week, and I felt proud and humbled they'd come on board. Change has a ripple effect - as a teacher you can influence 30 children, who then might influence 60 adults. At nine and 10, children are really positive, empathetic and absorb everything, like sponges. Next term, I plan to talk to them about energy and climate change in science lessons. What I learned:We are a throwaway society. We don't mend things any more nor realise quite how much we waste. We should think very carefully about what we use, why we use it and its impact on the environment and the world.

"Underwater hockey is played along the bottom of a pool ""I think I'm going to skip the gym today,"" is something often heard around this time of year.

While attached to the ceiling, exercisers perform a series of high-energy moves. Ms James explained that the workout, which comes from Philadelphia, incorporates resistance training and dance, and has changed people's entire body shapes. During the class, they do push-ups in a handstand, to which Ms James said: ""Well, I mean who can do that?""

But underwater hockey is a sport still played competitively today, attracting members from all over Wales. âI think a lot of people who are fed up of swimming laps enjoy a bit of different team sport - and itâs a really good team sport,â explained Newport Underwater Hockeyâs Jenny Murphy. Can children floss their way to fitness? Dance classes 'should be on prescription' Players wear their snorkels alongside a water polo hat to protect their ears, and flippers to help pick up speed. Instead of using the traditional hockey ball, a heavy lead puck is flicked along the bottom of the pool, using a smaller stick. Swimmers compete along the pool floor, coming up for air, but never lifting their heads out of the pool - instead blowing water from their snorkels and taking a deep breath.

The silks class sees participants hang in mid-air from a length of material as they learn new moves. She adds: âYou get to do fun stuff - you feel like a kid again.â Aerial silks instructor Tammi Brown is one of the founders at Up Side Down Circus in Cardiff and teaches âanything else that needs to go upâ. The former juggler explained that the sport involves the whole body, and said the circus classes are a fun environment. âI think with circus in general itâs more fun and itâs a non-competitive environment which I think is really important,â she said.
