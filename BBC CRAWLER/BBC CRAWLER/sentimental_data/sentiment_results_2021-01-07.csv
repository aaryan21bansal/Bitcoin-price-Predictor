Just some of the terms used by members of Congress to describe those who invaded the seat of US government on Wednesday. This video can not be played The words lawmakers used to describe Capitol riot The storming of the US Capitol building in Washington DC stunned viewers around the world. But how did Americans feel seeing the seat of their government being ransacked? A new US citizen, a diehard Trump supporter, an anti-Trump Republican and a young Black Lives Matter protester - all members of our BBC voter panel - weighed in. Read what they said. Almost 60 Democratic members of the US House of Representatives have backed new articles of impeachment against the Republican president over Wednesday's unrest. Congresswoman Ilhan Omar said in a tweet on Thursday that dozens of lawmakers had offered their support to the resolution that she and other members, including Rashida Tlaib, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Cori Bush, had prepared.

Donald Trump, who leaves office on 20 January, was impeached by the Democratic-held House in 2019 after he was accused of abusing his power and obstructing Congress. He was acquitted by the Republican-led Senate. Leading Democrats have also called for the president to be removed under the 25th Amendment, which allows the vice-president to step up if the president is unable to perform his duties owing to a mental or physical illness. It would require Vice-President Mike Pence and at least eight cabinet members to break with Mr Trump and invoke the amendment - something they have so far seemed unlikely to do. In a short press briefing that ran less than two minutes, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany condemned the armed insurrection at the US Capitol ""in the strongest possible terms"". Speaking ""on behalf of the entire White House"", she called the violence ""appalling, reprehensible and antithetical to the American way"". McEnany left the briefing room without taking any questions. President Trump has not been seen in public today and his social media accounts remain suspended. Washington DC's top prosecutor has not ruled out the possibility that the president himself could be investigated over the Capitol riot. Acting attorney general for the District of Columbia, Michael Sherwin, said ""all actors"" will be looked at. Asked whether this included Trump, Sherwin responded: âWeâre looking at all actors here and anyone that had a role and, if the evidence fits the elements of the crime, theyâre going to be charged."" The president had urged his supporters at a rally outside the White House to march on Congress, while pushing unfounded claims of electoral fraud. As events spiralled out of control, he tweeted urging them to ""remain peaceful"". The Association of Flight Attendants - a labour union that represents nearly 50,000 air crew - says it is ""taking a hard line for flight safety"" after problems aboard several flights to Washington DC. Citing the Capitol riot and the possibility that some participants might soon be flying back home, AFA President Sara Nelson suggested the culprits should be banned from planes. ""Acts against our democracy, our government, and the freedom we claim as 
Americans must disqualify these individuals from the freedom of flight."" In a video that went viral on social media, Trump supporters on a packed flight to the DC area heckled Senator Mitt Romney with chants of ""Traitor"". Trump's former chief of staff, John Kelly, has said he would vote to remove the president from office if he were still part of the cabinet. ""Yes, I would,"" Kelly, who served under Trump from 2017-18, told CNN's Jake Tapper in an interview on Thursday. ""The one thing we have going for us here, Jake, is that it's only 13 more days"", he added in reference to Biden's inauguration on 20 January. Wednesday's invasion of the Capitol has revived political talk of removing Trump from office via a constitutional amendment. Here's our explainer: What is the 25th Amendment? Allow Twitter content?

Today, the Senate's top Democrat joined voices calling for Trump's presidential powers to be removed immediately after his supporters violently stormed the US Capitol on Wednesday. Under the 25th Amendment, the vice-president can become acting president when a president is unable to continue his duties, if for example, he or she becomes incapacitated due to a physical or mental illness. The part of the amendment being discussed is section four, which allows the vice-president and a majority of the cabinet to declare President Trump unable to perform his duties. Find out more about the 25th Amendment here. The day before she died, Ashli Babbitt wrote on social media about the gathering of Trump supporters in the US capital. ""Nothing will stop us,"" she wrote. ""They can try and try and try but the storm is here and it is descending upon DC in less than 24 hours."" Babbitt, 35, was among the mob that breached the US Capitol on Wednesday. She has been identified by US Capitol Police as one of four people who died amid the chaos. A veteran of the US Air Force, Babbitt served two tours in Afghanistan and Iraq before later deployments with the National Guard to Kuwait and Qatar, her ex-husband, Timothy McEntee, told US media. A native of San Diego, California, Ms Babbitt had recently remarried, and worked at a pool service company with her husband, Aaron Babbitt. On social media, Babbitt described herself as a libertarian and patriot. She posted frequently about President Trump, expressing ardent support for him and echoing his unproven claims of wide-scale voter fraud. ""She had a personality that you either loved or hated,"" McEntee told NPR. ""She wasn't apologetic about it... she was proud of it, just like she was proud of her country and proud to be an American."" Read the full story here. Former First Lady Michelle Obama said Wednesday's events at the US Capitol ""desecrated the centre of American government"". In a lengthy statement released on social media, Obama said: ""Seeing the gulf between the responses to yesterday's riot and this 
summer's peaceful protests and the larger movement for racial justice is
 so painful. It hurts."" Decrying the sight of ""the traitorous flag of the Confederacy"", she lamented the ""cracked skulls and mass arrests"" that she said had been seen at Black Lives Matter protests. ""Millions voted for a man so obviously willing to burn down our democracy for his own ego,"" she said. She called on social media platforms to ""stop enabling this monstrous behaviour"" and permanently ban Trump. Obama also urged people to engage in ""the uncomfortable, sometimes painful process"" of ""putting America back together"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

As violent Trump supporters surged past barricades and into the US Capitol, news agency photographers - who were there to document the vote certifying Joe Biden's election win - captured extraordinary scenes. The last time government buildings were breached in Washington was in 1814 and the invaders were British soldiers. But in 2021 a Trump supporter, carrying the Confederate flag, is walking freely through the halls near the entrance to the Senate, encountering little resistance. Another image showed a rioter holding a podium bearing the seal of the Speaker of the House, while a third showed a man with a boot on the desk of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Yesterday's riots took place at the US Capitol - one of the country's most important buildings. It's the area of Washington DC - the capital city of the United States - where Congress is situated. This is where the US government writes, debates and passes laws. The Hill is centred around the US Capitol building - the main location protesters broke into. This is where elected officials in the Senate and the House of Representatives sit when debating and voting on laws, making up the upper and lower chambers of Congress. As well as these chambers, there are other office buildings where lawmakers and their staff work and meet to do their business. Find out more here. With his ban on Facebook and Instagram extended, President Donald Trump was notably absent on Wednesday as the US took stock of yesterday's events at the Capitol. According to the White House, one of his tasks for the day included presenting the country's highest civilian award, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, to three golfers - among them Babe Zaharias, who was honoured posthumously. Annika Sorenstam and Gary Player also received the honour. If you're just joining our live coverage, here are the top stories of the day so far: The
 US is reeling after supporters of President Trump stormed the Capitol 
building in Washington DC on the day Congress was meeting to confirm Joe
 Biden's election victory. Lawmakers
 were forced to take shelter, the building was put into lockdown and 
four people died in the chaos that followed a pro-Trump rally near the 
White House. Here's a breakdown of how events unfolded on Wednesday. Nga PhamBBC News South Vietnam flags were seen during the unrest On Wednesday, as protesters gathered outside before
swarming the Capitol building, the
yellow flags of the old South Vietnam regime could be seen. In fact, the yellow flags of the former South Vietnam are a common sight at
pro-Trump rallies across the United States. Vietnamese Americans, especially those of the older generation who fled Vietnam after
Saigon fell in 1975, are known for their support for the Republican party and
Donald Trump. A pre-election survey by the group Asian and Pacific Islander
American Vote found thatVietnamese Americans are the only major East Asian ethnic community that favoured Trump over Biden,external. Trumpâs anti-China and anti-communist rhetoric resonated greatly with the former refugees who risked their lives to escape
communism. But the support
for President Trump has also become an increasingly divisive issue amongst the
Vietnamese American community. Hours after the
Capitol riot, there are still calls on pro-Trump internet forums like
the ""ABC Trump"" Facebook page for Vietnamese Americans to âtake to
the streets in support of President Trumpâ as âthe battle
continuesâ. But there have also been condemnations. âThis is embarrassing,â
one young Vietnamese American wrote on Twitter, adding: âTheyâve brought shame to
the flagâ. Frank GardnerBBC Security Correspondent Saudi Arabia has been a close ally of the Trump administration Jihadist supporters of both the Islamic State group (IS) and al-Qaeda have been celebrating online the scenes of chaos and violence in Washington. The extremists and proponents of violent jihad - who view the US as their number one enemy - have been sharing images and videos from Capitol Hill, mocking American democracy and expressing hope that division will spread across the country. There was no immediate comment from either groupâs leadership on their official media outlets. The events will have deeply worried Americaâs allies in the Middle East, for whom the US acts as a security guarantor. Saudi Arabiaâs leaders, who had a close relationship with the Trump administration and who waited days before congratulating President-elect Joe Biden, will now be hoping for a period of calm. Sergeant-at-arms Paul Irving, who was responsible for maintaining law and order in the US House of Representatives, has resigned. His resignation was announced by Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi at her press conference moments ago. The top Democrat also said that she is calling for the resignation of Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund, who she says has not spoken to her on the phone once since violence was unleashed on the Capitol yesterday. Earlier today, her counterpart in the Senate, Chuck Schumer, said he would fire the Senate's sergeant-at-arms once Democrats become the majority in the chamber. Members of the Washington DC National Guard protect the Capitol on Wednesday night At a press conference earlier, Washington DC's mayor described yesterday's protests as ""textbook terrorism"" and ""an affront to democracy"". Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, squarely blamed Trump for inciting the violence seen yesterday. During the press conference, police also identified all four people that died during the chaos. Ashli Babbitt, a 35-year-old military veteran from California, was shot by a plainclothes Capitol police officer, according to Washington DC Police Chief Robert Contee. Benjamin Phillips, 50, Kevin Greeson, 55, and Rosanne Boyland, 34, also died after suffering ""medical emergencies"", he said. The three travelled from Pennsylvania, Alabama and Georgia respectively. This video can not be played Pelosi: 'President incited armed insurrection against US' Top Democrat Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House of Representatives, is giving a news conference now where she says she has a message for Trump's cabinet members. ""Do they stand by these actions? Are they ready to say for the next 13 days that this dangerous man can do more harm to our democracy?"" Pelosi goes on to say that the House may be forced to file of articles of impeachment due to Trump's recent ""seditious acts"". ""Although it's only 13 days left, any day could be a horror show,"" she tells reporters. Pelosi adds that Democrats are contacting her, demanding another attempt to remove Trump from office. To remind you, Trump has already been impeached once, by the Democrat-led House in December 2019 over allegations he improperly sought help from Ukraine to boost his chances of re-election. If impeached again, he would be the first president in US history to be impeached twice. ""My phone is exploding with 'impeach impeach impeach',"" she says. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""I condemn encouraging people to behave in the disgraceful way they did in the Capitol"" Donald Trump was ""completely wrong"" to cast doubt on the US election and encourage supporters to storm the Capitol, Boris Johnson has said. The UK prime minister said he ""unreservedly condemns"" the US president's actions. Four people diedafter a pro-Trump mob stormed the building in a bid to overturn the election result.

But asked by the BBC's political correspondent Alex Forsyth if President Trump was directly responsible, he said: ""All my life America has stood for some very important things. An idea of freedom, an idea of democracy. ""As you say, in so far as he encouraged people to storm the Capitol, and in so far as the president has consistently cast doubt on the outcome of a free and fair election, I believe that was completely wrong. ""I believe what President Trump has been saying about that has been completely wrong and I unreservedly condemn encouraging people to behave in the disgraceful way that they did in the Capitol.""

A woman died after being shot by police, and three others died as a result of ""medical emergencies"", local police said. UK politicians from different parties have all condemned Mr Trump's actions in encouraging the storming of the Capitol. Earlier, Home Secretary Priti Patel said the president's comments had ""directly led"" to the events and he ""didn't do anything to de-escalate that"".

"Lorry drivers crossing the Channel will continue to need a recent negative Covid test result ""until further notice"", the UK government has said. Hauliers have been required to prove they have tested negative since the border with France reopened last month. The decision to continue testing comes from the French government, the Department for Transport said. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps urged ""all hauliers to get tested before getting to the border"". The decision comes as the introduction of new trading rules between the UK and European Union prompts disruptionfor some businesses and hauliers. Mr Shapps said the government was ""offering support to businesses to set-up testing facilities at their own premises, assisting the smooth passage of trucks and good across the border, as well as setting up testing at information and advice sites around the country"". John Lewis scrapping overseas deliveries Adieu to the single market created by the UK UK set for 'bumpy' period as new EU rules come in Drivers and crew of heavy goods vehicles (HGVs), drivers of large goods vehicles (LGVs) and van drivers are advised to obtain a negative test before arriving in Kent or at other Channel crossing points. There are now 34 testing sites for hauliers situated in key ""stopping spots"" across the UK, with further sites being set up, the DfT said. Tests must be authorised and taken 72 hours before entry into France. In addition to a negative Covid test result,some hauliers require a new 24-hour permit to enter Kentsince the introduction of the new UK-EU rules.

"The Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine started being rolled out in the UK last month People who have had Covid vaccines are being warned to still take care. Vaccination has been shown to prevent severe infection, so even if people do catch the virus, they would be protected from getting seriously ill. The call comes as an NHS nurse working for the Hywel Dda University Health Board area said she contracted Covid-19 while waiting for her second dose. The health board said while the vaccine ""reduces your chance of suffering"", ""no vaccine is 100% effective"". The Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine, which started being rolled out in the UK last month, offersup to 95% protection against Covid-19 after a second dose. On Friday, the First Minister advised people receiving the vaccine to ""continue to act in a precautionary way"". Mark Drakeford said those people should ""recognise the new protection that they have"" but ""recognise as well that for many weeks, and for some months ahead, coronavirus is going to continue to be a feature of all our lives"". The hospital nurse, who works in the Hywel Dda University Health Board area in west Wales, said she felt ""angry and heartbroken"" about catching Covid at this stage. The nurse, who has asked not to be identified, said she was initially relieved to be offered the chance of a vaccine and despite difficulties getting an appointment, she said she received her first dose of the Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine last month. ""It gave me peace of mind. It made me feel safer and that I was doing the right thing for my family... but it gives a false sense of security,"" she said. The nurse said she was told it would take 10 days for the vaccine to offer some protection and reduce the risk of transmission. However, three weeks after the jab, she said she began to feel unwell - with ""quite severe symptoms"" of a bad cough, high temperature and breathlessness - and said she was ""shocked"" when she tested positive for coronavirus. Q&A: When will I get the Covid-19 vaccines? Wales lags behind England as 50,000 vaccinated She said her partner and one of her children also tested positive. The first vaccination rollout - the Pfizer vaccine -began on 8 December last year. Two doses are needed and to date around a million people have already received the first dose. The original advice - in Wales and the rest of the UK - was that people would need the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine three weeks after the first injection. But that changed last month to 12 weeks between doses on the advice of the UK's chief medical officers. The World Health Organisation does not recommend following the UK's decision, but has ""made a provision for countries in exceptional circumstances of vaccine supply constraints and epidemiological settings"" to delay the second dose for a few weeks to maximise the number of people getting a first dose. Pfizer said it has tested the vaccine's efficacy only when the two doses were given up to 21 days apart. The British Medical Association Cymru Wales has previously expressed concern about the length of time between doses. Doctors' union, BMA Cymru Wales, said there was a lack of evidence to support waiting 12 weeks for a second vaccine dose. Chair Dr David Bailey said: ""Our families don't choose to be exposed to a much higher dose of Covid, so we feel it's right that we should be protecting health workers and their families."" Hywel Dda health board said it had already vaccinated more than 10,000 high-risk people, including frontline NHS staff. Deputy Chief Executive Dr Philip Kloer, said: ""It is always distressing to hear about staff contracting the virus. Whilst the vaccine reduces your chance of suffering from Covid-19, no vaccine is 100% effective. ""There is particular risk that you may have contracted Covid-19 immediately prior to having the vaccine without knowing it, or that you may contract it in the week or two following vaccination as your body builds up protection. ""We have communicated the UK policy and assurances on second doses to our staff and assured them they will receive their second dose within 12 weeks of the first."" He added: ""Working within the NHS at the moment is very challenging and we acknowledge how difficult this is. ""Staff have worked tirelessly and made many sacrifices on behalf of caring for our communities and we are extremely grateful. We have put in place additional support and counselling and psychological support services."" Q&A: When will I get my Covid-19 vaccine?

"National Express has announced that it is suspending its entire national network of coach services from midnight on Sunday. The firm said tighter Covid restrictions and falling passenger numbers had prompted the decision. It added that it hoped to restart services in March. All customers whose travel has been cancelled will be contacted and offered a free amendment or full refund, the company said. All journeys before Monday 11 January will be completed to ensure any passengers making essential journeys are not stranded. Train services set to be reduced in lockdown Chris Hardy, managing director of National Express UK Coach, said: ""We have been providing an important service for essential travel needs. However, with tighter restrictions and passenger numbers falling, it is no longer appropriate to do this. He added that as the vaccination programme was rolled out and government guidance changed, the company would regularly review when services could restart. ""We plan to be back on the road as soon as the time is right and have put a provisional restart date of Monday 1 March in place,"" he said. National Express first suspended coach services during the coronavirus crisis in April, then restarted in July. Services have been operating at half capacity, with strict cleaning and Covid protocols. As the tier structure came into operation, demand for services reduced. As with the previous suspension, employees will be furloughed. Firms that transport passengers, including coach, rail and aviation businesses, have been under intense pressure during the coronavirus crisis. Avanti West Coast, the train operating company running services on the West Coast mainline, has confirmed it will cut its timetable from 18 January. Avanti says the new timetable will 'more closely reflect the current demand for our services whilst still allowing key workers, and those needing to make essential journeys, to travel with confidence'. During the first major lockdown in March, services on key intercity routes were reduced from three an hour to one. This included services from both Manchester and Birmingham to London. The Department for Transport has been consulting with all train operators about service reductions during the latest lockdown. The exact scale of reduction is still being worked on, but the DfT says service levels may fall to as low as 40% of the normal timetable by some operators. The focus is to ensure essential workers can still make essential journeys. An Avanti West Coast spokesperson said: ""Following discussions with the Department for Transport we will be introducing a new timetable on Monday 18 January. This will more closely reflect the current demand for our services whilst still allowing key workers, and those needing to make essential journeys, to travel with confidence."" On Thursday, Ryanair also announced that it wouldmake big cuts to its flight schedule from 21 January, with few, if any flights to or from the UK or Ireland until ""draconian travel restrictions are removed"". Train services are expected to be reduced in lockdown, with some in the industry anticipating reductions of between 50% and 60% compared with normal service. In the first national lockdown in England, services were reduced to almost half.

"Nursery staff are not advised to wear face coverings Childcare organisations are demanding to see evidence that it is safe for them to remain open while schools and colleges have closed to most pupils. Staff have close contact with children and babies daily, when they change nappies and receive them by the hand from parents, for example. Ministers have insisted early years settings are safe as young children have very low rates of the virus. Nurseries argue the evidence cited is based on data about old variant Covid. 'Very little' virus risk at nurseries - minister Why are nurseries still open this time around? 'It is more important my daughter goes to nursery' England's three main nursery organisations, the Early Years Alliance, the National Day Nurseries Association and childminders' group, Pacey, have joined together to mount a #ProtectEarlyYears campaign. They want the government to provide clear scientific evidence on the risks to early years staff of staying open, particularly in light of the increased transmissibility of the new variant of Covid-19. Sue Cardy, owner and manager of Ready Teddy Go Pre School, in Shoeburyness, Essex said: ""There isn't anyone who has asked: 'Is it 100% safe for us to remain fully open? No one can see the virus and staff may be asymptomatic, and so we all run an element of risk of catching or spreading it."" She added: ""Staff have families and are not all young... 50% of my staff are over 50 and some have underlying medical conditions."" Vicky, the manager of a church pre-school in Cheshire West and Chester said she could potentially have 30 children plus 10 staff in a church hall, with no PPE recommended, and limited social distancing. ""As an early years provider, I am increasingly worried about the safety of both staff and children, yet if we chose to partially close, we could be financially penalised."" And Georgie Morrell from Brighton and Hove said: ""Since re-opening, I have had four households tell me. they are Covid positive. ""This is clearly very close to home and yet we have been given no choice or support but to remain open and carry on."" Neil Leitch, chief executive of the Early Years Alliance, said: ""It is simply not acceptable that, at the height of a global pandemic, early years providers are being asked to work with no support, no protection and no clear evidence that is safe for them to do so. ""We know how vital access to early education and care is to many families, but it cannot be right to ask the early years workforce to put themselves at risk. That is why it is vital that the government takes the urgent steps needed to safeguard those working in the sector, particularly mass testing and priority access to vaccinations. Nursery providers are calling for staff to be tested, priority for vaccination and for state funding lost due to lower numbers during the pandemic, to be replaced by government. SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? Purnima Tanuku, chief Executive of National Day Nurseries Association, said nurseries were determined to support families during the current lockdown. But, she added: ""Time and again, whether it's on PPE, cleaning costs, testing or staffing, early years providers have been overlooked by the Department for Education. ""Now, they are the only part of the education sector fully open to all children and must be given priority."" On Wednesday, vaccines minister Nadim Zahawi said there was very little risk to younger children. ""The nursery sector has taken tremendous care in making sure the premises are also Covid safe. It is the right thing to do."" The Department for Education is yet to comment on the #ProtectEarlyYears demands. 'Very little' virus risk at nurseries - minister How long will nurseries stay open?

"Tennant was remembered as ""a beautiful soul"" and ""a sensitive and talented woman"" British model Stella Tennant took her own life after being ""unwell for some time"", her family has confirmed. In a statement, her family said it was ""a matter of our deepest sorrow and despair that she felt unable to go on.""

Tennant was ""a beautiful soul, adored by a close family and good friends, a sensitive and talented woman whose creativity, intelligence and humour touched so many"", they said.

"Medical staff are ""well over half way through"" vaccinating Scotland's care home residents with their first dose against Covid-19. The first minister said this was ""extremely important"", as care homes accounted for more than a third of Covid-related deaths in the past week. By Sunday more than 113,000 people in Scotland had been given their first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Some 1,100 vaccination centres are set to be operational within a week. The government has set a target of giving a first dose to everyone over the age of 80 in Scotland within the next four weeks. Scotland has about 30,000 residents living in care homes for older people. Where will I get my coronavirus vaccine? When will I be vaccinated against Covid? Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? A further 78 deaths of people who had tested positive for Covid-19 were announced on Thursday, the highest daily number during the second wave of the virus. Meanwhile, the National Records of Scotland said the virus had been mentioned on 183 death certificates in the week to Sunday - with 63 of these deaths occurring in care homes. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said this underlined the importance of rolling out the vaccine in care homes, saying it would hopefully start to significantly reduce the risk of residents dying due to coronavirus. And she said the government would start issuing a daily update on how many people had been given the jab from next week. The first minister said: ""Vaccination ultimately is what will provide us with the route out of this pandemic, so we are absolutely determined to make sure as many people as possible are vaccinated just as quickly as it is possible to do so."" As of Sunday, a total of 113,459 people had been given their first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in Scotland. The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccinebegan to be rolled out on Monday, and will be reflected in statistics from next week. A total of 36 people have had a second dose of the vaccine, with efforts now focused on giving a first jab to as many people as possible This means that people will now not receive their second dose for up to 12 weeks rather than within 21 days - a move that has beencriticised by some medics. But Chief Medical Officer Dr Gregor Smith said the first dose gave ""substantial"" protection against the virus. The vaccine is being rolled out to health and social care workers in the first instance, then care home residents and other over-80s. Eventually everyone in Scotland over the age of 18 - a total of 4.4m people - will be given a jab, although the government has refused to set targets beyond the initial phase due to uncertainty over supplies. Nicola Sturgeon has said Scotland is in a race between the vaccine and the virus The UK government had already committed to publishing vaccination figures on a daily basis, and the Scottish Conservatives had been pushing for the Scottish government to follow suit. Tory leader Douglas Ross said that ""publishing these numbers will increase transparency and give the public confidence that progress is being made in our fight against Covid-19"". The MP told BBC Scotland that he had been getting inquiries from constituents about when they could expect to get a jab, saying people ""need to know roughly where they are on that list and when they can expect to receive that vaccine"". Scottish Labour called on the government to backdate the statistics and to publish ""a detailed breakdown of how many people in each priority group has been vaccinated"". The party's health spokeswoman, Monica Lennon, said: ""Quicker progress must be made on securing vaccinations sites and vaccinators, including the contribution that community pharmacy teams can make."" At her daily briefing, Ms Sturgeon said over-80s should not worry if they had not yet been contacted about a vaccine appointment. She said these were being ""aligned with availability of supply"" in different local areas. The first minister said there was ""no need to phone your GP"", and that people would be ""contacted with an appointment as soon as possible"". She also said the government was considering ""as a matter of ongoing review"" whether tighter restrictions may still be needed. Scotland has been in a new lockdown since Tuesday, and Ms Sturgeon said it was ""probably too early"" for this to be reflected in the number of new infections. However she warned that the number of interactions people are having needed to be ""radically"" cut in order to slow the spread of the virus. She said shutting down construction, manufacturing and click-and-collect businesses was ""the kind of thing we need to look at if we have a concern that we are not sufficiently reducing the number of people who are out and about and interacting"".

"The 737 Max was cleared to fly again late last year, after being grounded since March 2019 Boeing has agreed to pay $2.5bn (Â£1.8bn) to settle US criminal charges that it hid information from safety officials about the design of its 737 Max planes. The US Justice Department said,externalthe firm chose ""profit over candour"", impeding oversight of the planes, which were involved in two deadly crashes. About $500m will go to families of the 346 people killed in the tragedies. Boeing said the agreement acknowledged how the firm ""fell short"". 'Boeing played Russian roulette with people's lives' Boeing 'withheld crucial information' on 737 Max Boeing 737 Max: 'Nothing will ever be the same' Boeing chief executive David Calhoun said,external: ""I firmly believe that entering into this resolution is the right thing for us to do - a step that appropriately acknowledges how we fell short of our values and expectations. ""This resolution is a serious reminder to all of us of how critical our obligation of transparency to regulators is, and the consequences that our company can face if any one of us falls short of those expectations."" The Justice Department said Boeing officials had concealed information about changes to an automated flight control system, known as MCAS, which investigations have tied to the crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia in 2018 and 2019. The decision meant that pilot training manuals lacked information about the system, which overrode pilot commands based on faulty data, forcing the planes to nosedive shortly after take-off. Boeing did not co-operate with investigators for six months, the DOJ said. ""The tragic crashes of Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 exposed fraudulent and deceptive conduct by employees of one of the world's leading commercial airplane manufacturers,"" said Acting Assistant Attorney General David Burns. ""Boeing's employees chose the path of profit over candour by concealing material information from the FAA concerning the operation of its 737 Max airplane and engaging in an effort to cover up their deception."" Under the terms of the agreement, Boeing was charged with one count of conspiracy to defraud the US, which will be dismissed after three years if the firm continues to comply with the deal. Of the total settlement, the majority - $1.77bn, some of which has already been paid - is due to go the firm's airline customers, who were affected by the grounding of the planes following the crashes. The firm also agreed to pay a penalty of $243.6m. This video can not be played Paul Njoroge says his family died because of Boeing's ""negligence"" But attorneys for the victims of the Ethiopian Airlines crash said the deal on Thursday would not end their pending civil lawsuit against Boeing. ""The allegations in the deferred prosecution agreement are just the tip of the iceberg of Boeing's wrongdoing â a corporation that pays billions of dollars to avoid criminal liability while stonewalling and fighting the families in court,"" said a statement from the group of lawyers representing them. They added that the FAA ""should not have allowed the 737 Max to return to service until all of the airplane's deficiencies are addressed and it has undergone transparent and independent safety reviews."" Boeing says it has now addressed concerns about the Max, while the plane returned to service in the US in December. The charge against Boeing was that its employees used ""misleading statements, half truths and omissions"" to dupe the regulator charged with maintaining the safety of US aviation. In the circumstances, you could say the company got off relatively lightly. It has avoided prosecution, and a large part of the settlement involves compensation to airlines - a fair amount of which it would probably have ended up paying anyway. The company would doubtless like to use this moment to draw a line under one of the most traumatic episodes in its history. Yet while the 737 Max is back in the air, the scrutiny of Boeing and the FAA is unlikely to stop here.

"Young women clap for heroes outside Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in London A revived initiative to applaud the heroes of the pandemic has returned - but much more quietly than last year. It comes after the founder of Clap for Carers distanced herself from its return after facing online abuse. Annemarie Plas wanted to bring back the weekly applause under a new name of Clap for Heroes to lift spirits in the new lockdown but it fell a little flat. Some health workers have said they would rather people stay at home and wear a mask than clap for them. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he participated at 20:00 GMT on Thursday, but clapping ""isn't enough"". ""They need to be paid properly and given the respect they deserve,"" hetweeted.,external, of the health workers. This video can not be played The weekly clap returned but Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said clapping alone ""wasn't enough"" The idea of clapping and banging pots from doorsteps originally began as a one-off to support NHS staff on 26 March - three days after the UK went into lockdown for the first time. After proving popular it was expanded to cover all key workers and continued every Thursday for 10 weeks last year, with millions of people across the UK taking part. Is this the last hurrah for clap for carers? Clap for Carers creator on her viral challenge Members of the Royal Family and politicians including Prime Minister Boris Johnson also joined in with the show of support. However, the event faced criticism for becoming politicised, with some suggesting the NHS would benefit more from extra funding than applause. Thursday's newly-revived event drew fewer supporters than previously. People in some streets stood on doorsteps and leaned out windows to clap for the pandemic's heroes, and landmarks in London were illuminated blue for the occasion - but reports suggested the applause was noticeably quieter than last year. Annemarie Plas and her family were threatened online for her efforts On Wednesday, Ms Plas, a 36-year-old mother-of-one, announced the return of the initiative, saying she hoped to ""lift the spirit of all of us"" including ""all who are pushing through this difficult time"". But some NHS workers were less than enthusiastic. Ami Jones, an intensive care consultant from Wales,tweeted:,external""No thanks.

""I have no political agenda, I am not employed by the government, I do not work in PR, I am just an average mum at home trying to cope with the lockdown situation,"" she said, in a statement.

"The Belfast Health Trust has said it has no other option but to cancel urgent cancer surgery. These are known as red flag cancer cases where an operation is expected to impact on a person's recovery and even surviving the disease. The Department of Health has confirmed to the BBC that it's estimated that one in 60 people in NI have Covid-19. It is understood the trust expects ""many 100s"" of new Covid patients in the next three weeks. The demand for bed space is described as ""highly significant"", while a source added that all is being done to ""find beds and staff"". They continued: ""People in here are moving heaven and earth to find beds in anticipation of what is coming and that's why some cancer patients even those who have been told their case is urgent are having their surgery cancelled."" Effectively the move means that choices are already being made within the health service about who should receive critical treatment. The daughter of a 66-year-old woman who was told her surgery has been cancelled has described the move as ""deeply worrying"". ""Mummy was diagnosed with cancer of the lining of the bladder in November, it's since spread to the muscle wall of her bladder. She was told in December her surgery was urgent - but now it's been cancelled. ""She is so frightened, it is just horrendous and I'm sure mum is not alone."" While a cancer patient might have been told their case is critical and that treatment is necessary within weeks,  some Covid patients are also being told that in order to survive they require treatment immediately. With the number of cases soaring this is worse than the first lockdown and according to health professionals there is worse to come. The BBC understands that the health minister is expected to respond to the problem in the coming days. It is hoped that he will announce a regional approach to tackling cancelled surgeries among the various health trusts. Northern Ireland's other health trusts have also begun to cancel operations due to pressures created by coronavirus. The Northern, Western, Southern and South-Eastern trusts have said they will be cancelling planned surgeries. Hospitals have said they werefacing a surge in coronavirus cases following Christmas. On Thursday, 599 people were in hospital with Covid-19. The Belfast Trust apologised for the ""distress"" caused by the cancellations. ""Belfast Trust has made the difficult decision to cancel all planned inpatient surgery this week due to rising numbers of Covid cases,"" a spokesperson said. The trust said it was contacting those affected and ""will rearrange this surgery as soon as possible and we will do everything we can to ensure continuity of care throughout this challenging time"". Nightingale Hospital in Belfast to be expanded Ambulance queues 'at all NI emergency departments' The Northern Trust said it had ""regrettably"" cancelled the majority of its planned or elective surgeries to ""both free up staff to support the significant COVID-19 surge experience in the Trust and to reduce the clinical risk to patients who are or may be exposed to the virus"". It apologised and said it would contacting people. The Western Trust said it is ""facing unprecedented pressures due to the escalating rate"" of Covid infections. Director of Acute Hospitals, Geraldine McKay, said routine elective inpatient, outpatient and day case surgeries have now been postponed until further notice. She said the decision was ""very regrettable, but necessary"". ""Red flag and some time critical procedures and clinics will continue, but will be reviewed daily,"" she said. Should the number of Covid patients further increase, she added, the trust will ""have no option but to move to perform emergency and trauma surgery only"". A spokesperson for the South Eastern Trust said it was still carrying out some planned surgery, but the majority would be cancelled by next week. The Southern Trust said it had taken its decision in response to the ""very significant recent increase"" in the number of Covid-19 cases. It said this had been compounded by an increase in trauma workload and recent icy weather. The trust said it would continue to provide day surgery and endoscopy across its hospital sites. Of the 3,359 planned procedures scheduled across NI between 29 December 2020 and 4 January, 3,267 went ahead as planned, according to the Health and Social Care website. There were 92 cancellations which amounted to about 3% of all surgeries.

"The coronavirus vaccine rollout is a national challenge requiring an unprecedented effort - involving the armed forces - Boris Johnson says. The PM confirmed almost 1.5 million people in the UK have now received at least one dose of a Covid vaccine. More than 1,000 GP-led sites in England will be able to offer a total of ""hundreds of thousands"" of jabs each day by 15 January, he said. The Army will use ""battle preparation techniques"" to help achieve that goal. It came as a further 1,162 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported on Thursday - the second consecutive day of more than 1,000 recorded fatalities - and 52,618 new cases. And as Simon Stevens, head of the NHS in England, warned 10,000 patients with Covid had been admitted to hospital since Christmas Day. Can we really jab our way out of lockdown? How busy are hospitals in England? New travel curbs to stop South Africa variant Speaking at a Downing Street news conference, Mr Johnson said there would likely be ""lumpiness and bumpiness"" in the rollout of vaccines. He said: ""Let's be clear, this is a national challenge on a scale like nothing we've seen before and it will require an unprecedented national effort. ""Of course, there will be difficulties, appointments will be changed but... the Army is working hand in glove with the NHS and local councils to set up our vaccine network and using battle preparation techniques to help us keep up the pace."" Alongside GPs, there will be 223 hospital sites andseven ""giant vaccination centres""- as well as an initial 200 community pharmacies - offering jabs, Mr Johnson said. Everyone will have a vaccination centre within 10 miles of their home, he added, with a ""full vaccination deployment plan"" to be published on Monday. He also said there would be a national booking system for vaccinations - but did not give any more details. This video can not be played Brigadier Phil Prosser said his task was to ensure everyone in England had equal access to the vaccine Brigadier Phil Prosser, commander of military support to the vaccine delivery programme, told the news conference his team was ""embedded"" with the NHS. He said his ""day job"" is to deliver combat supplies to UK forces in time of war, ""at speed in the most arduous and challenging conditions"". The government has set a target to offer vaccination slots to 15 millionin the top four priority groups- including all over-80s - by 15 February. And Mr Johnson said that, with the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine available, he could pledge one of those groups - care home residents - would all receive their jab by the end of January. The widespread rollout of the vaccine has begun in earnest with the first doses delivered during the day to family doctors for distribution. But therewere concerns from some GPs over supplies, as Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the levels of vaccine supply was the ""rate-limiting"" factor as jabs would be delivered as quickly as stock is available. It comes as some hospitals in England areat risk of becoming Covid-only sites, with rising admissions for the virus forcing trusts to cut back on other services. The latest NHS statistics also show that there were 30,370 patients with Covid in UK hospitals on Tuesday, a much higher figure than the first peak in the spring of 2020. Hospital leaders have warned medics are becoming increasingly stretched with ""untrained staff"" used to fill gaps. At 20:00 GMT, people in some streets stepped out onto doorsteps to clap for the heroes of the pandemic, following a weekly initiative which gained popularity during the UK's first lockdown. However, Thursday's clap for heroes was more muted than those seen last year, perhaps reflecting criticism the initiativehad become politicised. Lots of detail has been given about how the NHS - working hand-in-hand with the military - will be able to deliver the vaccines. There will be more local vaccination centres, hospital hubs and even mass vaccination at sports stadiums. Thousands of extra vaccinators have already been trained - and thousands more are waiting in the wings. But the biggest hurdle the UK faces is vaccine supply. If it is not available, it cannot be put in arms no matter how good the vaccination network is. In the long-term, supply is not likely to be a problem - but in the coming weeks it could be tight. There is enough vaccine in the country to offer all those at highest risk a jab by mid-February. But it is not yet all ready for the NHS to use, either because the final safety checks have not been done or the vaccine has not been put into vials. The former depends on lab work by the medicines regulator, while the latter is the job of a plant in Wrexham. Each stage takes some time. The target is achievable, but a lot has to go right. Sir Simon Stevens said there were 50% more coronavirus patients in England's hospitals now compared to the peak last April, affecting every region across the country. He said: ""That number is accelerating very, very rapidly... the pressures are real and they are growing."" In Northern Ireland, the Belfast Health Trust has said it has no other option but to cancel all of its urgent cancer surgeryamid ""highly significant"" demand for bed space. The cancelled operations will affect those patients for whom surgery could impact recovery and even survival, the trust said. Boris Johnson said all parts of government would be throwing everything at the vaccination effort ""round the clock"" In one positive development for hospitals,two more life-saving drugs that can cut deaths by a quarterin patients who are sickest with Covid have been cleared for widespread use, with immediate effect. The anti-inflammatory medications, given via a drip, save an extra life for every 12 treated, researchers said, following NHS trials. Elsewhere, the UK has implemented restrictions on travellers to England from countries near South Africato stop the spread of the South African Covid variant. Meanwhile, Mr Johnson and Sir Simon were asked about persistent social media claims that coronavirus does not exist - and that reports of packed hospital wards of people being treated are just a myth. Sir Simon said that such misinformation was an ""insult"" to hard-working critical care staff. ""There is nothing more demoralising than having that kind of nonsense spouted when it is most obviously untrue,"" he said.

"Two more life-saving drugs have been found that can cut deaths by a quarter in patients who are sickest with Covid. The anti-inflammatory medications, given via a drip, save an extra life for every 12 treated, say researchers who have carried out a trial in NHS intensive care units. Supplies are already available across the UK so they can be used immediately to save hundreds of lives, say experts. There are over 30,000 Covid patients in UK hospitals - 39% more than in April. The UK government is working closely with the manufacturer, to ensure the drugs - tocilizumab and sarilumab - continue to be available to UK patients. As well as saving more lives, the treatments speed up patients' recovery and reduce the length of time that critically-ill patients need to spend in intensive care by about a week. Both appear to work equally well and add to the benefit already found with a cheap steroid drug called dexamethasone. Life-saving coronavirus drug 'major breakthrough' Although the drugs are not cheap, costing around Â£500 per patient, on top of the Â£5 course of dexamethasone, the advantage of using them is clear - and less than the cost per day of an intensive care bed of around Â£2,000, say experts. Lead researcher Prof Anthony Gordon, from Imperial College London, said: ""For every 12 patients you treat with these drugs you would expect to save a life. It's a big effect."" In theREMAP-CAP trial,externalcarried out in six different countries, including the UK, with around 800 intensive care patients: Nearly 36% of intensive care Covid patients receiving standard care died The new drugs reduced that by a quarter, to 27%, when given to patients within 24 hours of them entering intensive care Prof Stephen Powis, NHS national medical director, said: ""The fact there is now another drug that can help to reduce mortality for patients with Covid-19 is hugely welcome news and another positive development in the continued fight against the virus."" Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock said:  ""The UK has proven time and time again it is at the very forefront of identifying and providing the most promising, innovative treatments for its patients. ""Today's results are yet another landmark development in finding a way out of this pandemic and, when added to the armoury of vaccines and treatments already being rolled out, will play a significant role in defeating this virus."" The drugs dampen down inflammation, which can go into overdrive in Covid patients and cause damage to the lungs and other organs. Doctors are being advised to give them to any Covid patient who, despite receiving dexamethasone, is deteriorating and needs intensive care. Tocilizumab and sarilumab have already been added to the government's export restriction list, which bans companies from buying medicines meant for UK patients and selling them on for a higher price in another country. The research findings have not yet been peer reviewed or published in a medical journal.

"Some supermarkets faced issues over the festive period due to ports disruption The UK meat industry has called for the early vaccination of workers to keep food supplies running smoothly during the coronavirus crisis. It warned that absences during the pandemic, coupled with disruption at ports, could hit food supply chains. An early vaccination call for supermarket staff was also made by the boss of Sainsbury's on Thursday. The government said the food industry remains ""well-prepared"" to make sure people have the food they need. The British Meat Processors Association (BMPA) said coronavirus and disruption at ports due to new systems brought in after the Brexit transition period were ""a severe challenge to the industry and to the smooth running of the nation's food supply chain"". It argued frontline workers in meat factories should get early vaccinations due to the risk of a rapid spread of the new strains of the virus among key workers. The government hasset out who will get vaccinated first, which starts with care home residents and the oldest and most vulnerable people. But Nick Allen, chief executive of the BMPA, said it would be logical to also prioritise key workers in the food industry. ""As the new coronavirus variant takes hold across the whole of the UK, we are hearing widespread reports of rapidly rising absences in the food supply chain,"" he said. Covid vaccine: When will you be eligible? Oxford vaccine rolled out to hundreds of GP sites in England Some firms supplying supermarkets ""are seeing a tripling of staff having to take time off work through illness or enforced self-isolation"", he added. Pressures on staff during the lockdown include illness, having to self-isolate, and childcare while some schools are closed under England's lockdown. Due to the specialised nature of meat production, if even a few key factory personnel such as the foreman or managers are absent, production can stop, Mr Allen said. Early vaccinations should not be restricted to the meat industry, according to Mr Allen. All key workers in the food industry should get early vaccinations, he said. Even supermarkets themselves are having problems with absences, he suggested. ""The key food supply chains ought to be prioritised,"" he said. ""All food industry key workers should be prioritised [for vaccination]"". The government is advised on vaccinations by a group of experts called the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). Professor Wei Shen Lim, Covid-19 Chair for the JCVI, said the committee's advice on vaccine prioritisation ""was developed with the aim of preventing as many deaths as possible."" ""As the single greatest risk of death from Covid-19 is older age, prioritisation is primarily based on age,"" he said. ""It is estimated that vaccinating everyone in the priority groups would prevent 99% of deaths, including those associated with occupational exposure to infection,"" the professor added. Sainsbury's boss Simon Roberts also called for early vaccinations for key workers on Thursday. ""My view is that priority has to be given to those that need it first,"" he said. ""Those on the frontline should be part of that as and when capacity becomes available."" Absence rates for Sainsbury's staff are lower than at the peak of the crisis, but are rising, and have stepped up in the last few days, he said. The Sainsbury's absence rate is currently 8%. The business has 172,000 employees. Asda said that it had seen an increase in employees self-isolating and shielding in line with the rising UK infection rate. However, it said that absence rates were still lower than at the peak of the pandemic. ""We are taking proactive steps to manage colleague absences by retaining temporary colleagues hired over the Christmas period and are bringing in additional temporary colleagues in those stores that need them the most,"" and Asda spokesman said. Tesco has asked clinically vulnerable staff to stay at home. Morrisons, meanwhile, is also seeing more absences, but the rate is still more than half that of the peak of the pandemic. It is also a bigger business having taken on 26,000 extra staff during the crisis. Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium said: ""While absence rates are currently rising, retailers are closely monitoring the situation in stores and distribution centres and supply chains continue to run smoothly. A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs said: ""As we have seen in recent months, the UK has a large, diverse and highly resilient food supply chain. ""We continue to closely monitor the situation and are working closely with the food industry on the workforce and absence related challenges presented by the pandemic."" They added that the food industry remains ""well-prepared"" to make sure people across the country have the food they need. UK ports have seen disruption due to the effects of coronavirus on trade and new systems brought in after the Brexit transition period. Mr Roberts of Sainsbury's said that, so far, the flow of goods from Europe is in decent shape, but there had been some problems in sending food to Northern Ireland.There is still some backlog in general merchandising, he added. However, Scottish seafood exporters warned on Thursday that they had been hit by the ""perfect storm of Brexit disruption"". ""Weakened by Covid-19, and the closure of the French border before Christmas, the end of the Brexit transition period has unleashed layer upon layer of administrative problems, resulting in queues, border refusals and utter confusion,"" said Donna Fordyce, chief executive of Seafood Scotland. She said IT problems in France meant consignments were diverted from Boulogne-sur-Mer to Dunkirk, ""which was unprepared as it wasn't supposed to be at the export frontline."" There have also been IT issues on the UK side with HMRC, she added. ""These businesses are not transporting toilet rolls or widgets,"" she said. ""They are exporting the highest quality, perishable seafood which has a finite window to get to markets in peak condition. If the window closes these consignments go to landfill.""

"Nguyen Huy Hung was one of 39 people who died in a container en route from Belgium to Essex The father of a 15-year-old boy who was one of 39 people to die in a lorry trailer said he learned of his son's death through social media. Nguyen Huy Hung died in the sealed container en route from Belgium to Purfleet, Essex, in October 2019. His father, Nguyen Huy Tung, said the family could not believe it until ""we saw his body by our own eyes"" at the hospital. Eight men are being sentenced for their role in the people-smuggling operation. The bodies of 39 Vietnamese nationals were discovered in a refrigerated trailer on 23 October last year The 39 Vietnamese migrants, aged 15 to 44, were sealed inside the container for at least 12 hours. The Old Bailey heard how it became a ""tomb"" as temperatures reached an ""unbearable"" 38.5C (101F). The people trapped inside had used a metal pole to try to punch through the roof, but only managed to dent the interior. The supposed 'VIP' journey that killed 39 people Irish smuggling connection to Essex lorry deaths At a sentencing hearing set to last three days in front of Mr Justice Sweeney, some of their final desperate phone messages were played in court. In one message, a man spoke with ragged breaths as he apologised to his family. ""I can't breathe,"" he said. ""I want to come back to my family. Have a good life."" In the background, a voice could be heard pleading: ""Come on everyone. Open up, open up."" Prosecutor Jonathan Polnay read out statements from the victims' families, and the mother of another 15-year-old who died, Dinh Dinh Binh, said her family had ""not been able to get back to our normal life yet"". ""Our economic conditions and work are negatively affected,"" she said. ""We have had to sell some properties of the family to afford our life."" The 39 people who died in the back of a trailer as it crossed the North Sea between Zeebrugge and the UK Tran Hai Loc and his wife Nguyen Thi Van, both 35, were found huddled together in the trailer, and left behind two children, aged six and four. The children's grandfather, Tran Dinh Thanh, said: ""At the moment their children are very small - this incident will affect their future. ""Every day, when they come home from school they always look at the photos of their parents on the altar. The decease of both parents is a big loss to them."" The moment lorry driver Maurice Robinson opened the trailer door and discovered the bodies inside was captured on CCTV Phan Thi Thanh, 41, had sold the family home and left her son with his godmother before setting off on the journey. Her son, who is now being looked after by his father in the UK, said he felt ""very heartbroken with mum not around"". Haulier boss Ronan Hughes, 41, of Tyholland, County Monaghan, Ireland, was described as a ringleader of the operation. He closed his eyes as the phone messages were played to the court. Other defendants hung their heads. Both Maurice Robinson (l) and Ronan Hughes (r) admitted 39 counts of manslaughter in connection with the case Hughes had previously admitted manslaughter, as had 26-year-old lorry driver Maurice Robinson, from County Armagh, who discovered the bodies in the trailer. Eamonn Harrison, 24, of Newry, County Down, who dropped off the trailer at Zeebrugge port, and people-smuggler Gheorghe Nica, 43, were convicted of the same charge by a jury. They will be sentenced alongside Christopher Kennedy, 24, from County Armagh, Valentin Calota, 38, from Birmingham, Alexandru-Ovidiu Hanga, 28, of Hobart Road, Tilbury, Essex, and Gazmir Nuzi, 43, of Tottenham, north London, who were convicted for their role in the smuggling. Gheorghe Nica and Eamonn Harrison were both found guilty of manslaughter Mr Polnay said: ""These defendants were party to a sophisticated, long-running and profitable conspiracy to smuggle [mainly] Vietnamese migrants to the UK, in the back of lorries, in a deliberate and intentional breach of border control."" The fee was between Â£10,000 and Â£13,000 for each migrant, for the ""VIP route"", the court heard. Mr Polnay said seven smuggling trips were identified between May 2018 and 23 October 2019, but there was ""an irresistible inference that there were more events than those that were fortuitously detected"".

"Who were the protesters that broke into buildings on Capitol Hill after attending a rally in support of Donald Trump? Some were carrying symbols and flags strongly associated with particular ideas and factions, but in practice many of the members and their causes overlap. Images show individuals associated with a range of extreme and far-right groups and supporters of fringe online conspiracy theories, many of whom have long been active online and at pro-Trump rallies. One of the most startling images, quickly shared across social media, shows a man dressed with a painted face, fur hat and horns, holding an American flag. He's been identified as Jake Angeli, a well-known supporter of thebaseless conspiracy theory QAnon. He calls himself the QAnon Shaman. His social media presence shows him attending multiple QAnon events and posting YouTube videos about deep state conspiracies. He was pictured in November making a speech in Phoenix, Arizona, about unproven claims the election was fraudulent. His personal Facebook page is filled with images and memes relating to all sorts of extreme ideas and conspiracy theories. This video can not be played Phone footage reveals chaotic scenes inside US Capitol Another group spotted at the storming of the Capitol were members of thefar-right group Proud Boys. The organisation was founded in 2016 and is anti-immigrant and all male. In the first US presidential debate President Trump in response to a question about white supremacists and militias said: ""Proud Boys - stand back and stand by."" The individual on the right is Nick Ochs, who describes himself as a ""Proud Boy Elder"". One of their members, Nick Ochs, tweeted a selfie inside the building saying ""Hello from the Capital lol"". He also filmed a live stream inside. We haven't identified the individual standing on the left in the above image. Mr Ochs' profile on the messaging app Telegram describes himself as a ""Proud Boy Elder from Hawaii."" Individuals with large followings online were also spotted at the protests. Among them was the social media personality Tim Gionet, who goes under the pseudonym ""Baked Alaska"". Tim Gionet, better known as ""Baked Alaska"", livestreamed himself from the Capitol on Wednesday His livestream from inside the Capitol posted on a niche streaming service was watched by thousands of people and showed him talking to other protesters. A Trump supporter, Mr Gionet has made a name for himself as an internet troll. He's been described by theSouthern Poverty Law Centre, a US nonprofit legal advocacy group,,externalas a ""white nationalist"",a label he disputed in a comment to The Insider,external. YouTube banned his channel in October after he posted videos of himself harassing shop workers and refusing to wear a face-mask during the coronavirus pandemic. Other platforms that have previously shut down his accounts include Twitter and PayPal. This video can not be played 'Treason, traitors and thugs'  - the words lawmakers used to describe Capitol riot A photo that went viral of a man who'd entered the office of senior Democrat politician Nancy Pelosi has been named as Richard Barnett from Arkansas. Richard Barnett left a message for US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi saying ""we will not back down"" Outside Capitol Hill buildings, he told the New York Times that he took an envelope from the speaker's office and says left a note calling her an expletive.

Reacting to the New York Times interview, Republican congressman Steve Womack said on Twitter: ""I'm sickened to learn that the below actions were perpetrated by a constituent."" Local media reports say Mr Barnett is involved in a group that supports gun rights, and that he was interviewed at a 'Stop the Steal' rally following the presidential election - a movement that refused to accept Joe Biden's victory and supports the president's unsubstantiated claims of electoral fraud. In the interview at the rally organised by 'Engaged Patriots' he said: ""If you don't like it, send somebody out to get me 'cause I ain't going down easy."" The group associated with Mr Barnett held a fundraiser in October with proceeds going towards body cameras for the local police department, according to the Westside Eagle Observer local paper. As the events were unfolding, many social media users, especially those associated with QAnon and supporters of President Trump, were claiming that agitators fromthe loose-knit left-wing group antifawere involved. The implication was that these activists were disguised as Trump supporters to create disruption. A number of prominent Republican politicians, such as US Representative Matt Gaetz, claimed it was antifa masquerading as Trump supporters. One widely-shared post claimed one protester had a ""communist hammer"" tattoo, as evidence that he wasn't a Trump supporter. On closer inspection, the symbol is from the video game series Dishonored. There have also been suggestions that Mr Angeli, the man wearing fur and horns, was a Black Lives Matter supporter, with users sharing an image of him at a BLM event in Arizona. Mr Angeli was indeed at that event, but he was there as a counter-protester. In images taken there, he's seen holding a QAnon sign. At least one of the rioters was holding a Confederate flag, which represented US states that supported the continuation of slavery during the American civil war. For this reason, it is considered by many to be a symbol of racism and there have been calls to ban it across the US. Others see it as an important part of southern US history. A protester carries the Confederate flag after breaching US Capitol security In July it was announcedthat the flag could no longer be flown on American military propertiesbecause of a new policy to reject ""divisive symbols"". President Trump has defended the use of the Confederate flag in the past, saying: ""I know people that like the Confederate flag and they're not thinking about slavery...I just think it's freedom of speech."" There were also protesters holding aloft flags featuring a coiled rattlesnake on a yellow background, often accompanied by the phrase ""don't tread on me"". This is known as the Gadsden flag, harking back to the American revolution and the war to expel British colonialists. It was adopted by libertarians in the 1970s,according to an article in the New Yorker,external, and more recently became a favourite symbol of conservative Tea Party activists. The flag has been adopted by the right over the past couple of decades, says Prof Margaret Weir, a political science expert at Brown University. It is also used by anti-government, white supremacist groups who embrace violence, she says. Reporting by Jack Goodman, Christopher Giles, Olga Robinson and Shayan Sardarizadeh.

"Young women clap for heroes outside Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in London A revived initiative to applaud the heroes of the pandemic has returned - but much more quietly than last year. It comes after the founder of Clap for Carers distanced herself from its return after facing online abuse. Annemarie Plas wanted to bring back the weekly applause under a new name of Clap for Heroes to lift spirits in the new lockdown but it fell a little flat. Some health workers have said they would rather people stay at home and wear a mask than clap for them. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he participated at 20:00 GMT on Thursday, but clapping ""isn't enough"". ""They need to be paid properly and given the respect they deserve,"" hetweeted.,external, of the health workers. This video can not be played The weekly clap returned but Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said clapping alone ""wasn't enough"" The idea of clapping and banging pots from doorsteps originally began as a one-off to support NHS staff on 26 March - three days after the UK went into lockdown for the first time. After proving popular it was expanded to cover all key workers and continued every Thursday for 10 weeks last year, with millions of people across the UK taking part. Is this the last hurrah for clap for carers? Clap for Carers creator on her viral challenge Members of the Royal Family and politicians including Prime Minister Boris Johnson also joined in with the show of support. However, the event faced criticism for becoming politicised, with some suggesting the NHS would benefit more from extra funding than applause. Thursday's newly-revived event drew fewer supporters than previously. People in some streets stood on doorsteps and leaned out windows to clap for the pandemic's heroes, and landmarks in London were illuminated blue for the occasion - but reports suggested the applause was noticeably quieter than last year. Annemarie Plas and her family were threatened online for her efforts On Wednesday, Ms Plas, a 36-year-old mother-of-one, announced the return of the initiative, saying she hoped to ""lift the spirit of all of us"" including ""all who are pushing through this difficult time"". But some NHS workers were less than enthusiastic. Ami Jones, an intensive care consultant from Wales,tweeted:,external""No thanks.

Ina tweet,externalposted hours before the weekly clap was due to return, Ms Plas, a Dutch national living in south London, said she had been targeted with personal abuse and threats against her and her family by ""a hateful few"" on social media. ""I have no political agenda, I am not employed by the government, I do not work in PR, I am just an average mum at home trying to cope with the lockdown situation,"" she said, in a statement. She said the newly revived clap could and should still happen at 20:00 GMT. ""It's up to each person to decide how relevant or worthwhile they feel it is to participate,"" she said.

"This video can not be played When a mob stormed the US capitol The US Congress has certified Joe Biden's victory in the presidential election, hours after supporters of Donald Trump stormed the building in an attack that saw four people die. Lawmakers resumed the session after police removed a mob that had been encouraged by President Trump as part of his attempt to overturn his defeat. The certification clears the way for Mr Biden to be sworn in on 20 January. In response, Mr Trump finally pledged an ""orderly transition"" of power. Follow our live updates here Wednesday's chaotic scenes followed months of escalating rhetoric from Mr Trump and some Republican allies that sought to undermine the result of the 3 November election. The invasion of the Capitol by the president's supporters - some armed - was an event without precedent in modern American history. Washington DC Mayor Muriel Bowser said one of the four who died - a woman named as Ashli Babbitt - was part of a group that forced entry into the chamber of the House of Representatives while it was still in session. They were confronted by plainclothes officers, and an officer pulled out a weapon and fired it. What does a deadly day mean for Trump's legacy? In pictures: Pro-Trump protesters storm Capitol 'They tried to break in - then I heard a shot' The US Capitol Police said the employee involved had been put on administrative leave pending an investigation. This video can not be played The US Congress has formally confirmed Joe Biden's victory Local media said Ashli Babbitt was a San Diego-area US Air Force veteran and Trump supporter. She was proclaimed dead at hospital. One woman and two men died as a result of ""medical emergencies"", officials said, without giving details. At least 14 members of the police were injured. The FBI is now seeking to identify those involved,externalin the rampage, which came after Mr Trump had told a rally he would never concede the election and urged his supporters to march on the Capitol. It also came on the daytwo Democrats won Senate seats in elections in Georgia,giving the party effective control of the whole of Congress. This major political victory will ease the passage of Mr Biden's agenda after he is inaugurated. Democrat Joe Biden's victory was confirmed at about 03:30 local time (08:30 GMT) on Thursday in a joint session presided over by Republican Vice-President Mike Pence, who called the violence a ""dark day in the history of the United States Capitol"". Mr Biden blasted the ""insurrection"" as Mr Trump, while telling the mob to ""go home"", continued to make false claims of electoral fraud. The outgoing president's Twitter and Facebook accounts were later frozenand remain blocked. Objections by some Republican lawmakers to overturn the result in Arizona and Pennsylvania were rejected. Congress formally certified the final electoral college vote, with Mr Biden receiving 306 votes to Mr Trump's 232. For days Mr Trump had been piling pressure on his vice-president to block certification. But in a letter to Congress on Wednesday, Mr Pence said he had no ""unilateral authority to decide which electoral votes should be counted"". This video can not be played 'I just want the real winner to be president' In declaring the final vote totals, Mr Pence said this ""shall be deemed a sufficient declaration of the persons elected president and vice-president of the United States"". Shortly afterwards Mr Trump said in a statement: ""Even though I totally disagree with the outcome of the election, and the facts bear me out, nevertheless there will be an orderly transition on January 20th."" On Thursday the White House press office issued a statement saying it ""grieves the loss of life"" and will continue ""to pray for a speedy recovery for those who suffered injury"". This is how the Trump presidency ends. Not with a whimper, but with a bang. For weeks, Donald Trump had been pointing to 6 January as a day of reckoning. It was when he told his supporters to come to Washington DC, and challenge Congress - and Vice-President Mike Pence - to discard the results of November's election and keep the presidency in his hands. Crisis can bring political opportunity, and there are many politicians who will not hesitate to use it to gain advantage. Donald Trump - for now - is still in power. And while he may be chastened, he may be sitting in the White House residence watching television temporarily without his social media outlet, he will not be silent for long. And once he decamps for his new Florida home, he could begin making plans to settle scores and, perhaps, someday return to power and rebuild a legacy that, for the moment, lies in tatters.Biden win certified by Congress after chaotic day Read more from Anthony In addition to Mr Pence, some Republicans who previously stood by the president have now spoken out. Has the Capitol been attacked before? The people who still believe Trump won What is the electoral college? Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell definitively broke with Mr Trump in an emotional speech from the chamber floor on Wednesday, saying: ""If this election were overturned by mere allegations from the losing side, our democracy would enter a death spiral."" After the session resumed, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer blasted the mob at the Capitol as ""rioters and insurrectionists, goons and thugs, domestic terrorists"", saying the president ""bears a great deal of the blame"". This video can not be played ""We will never give up, we will never concede"", Trump tells supporters Senator Kelly Loeffler, who lost her bid for election in Georgia's vote on Tuesday, said she could no longer in good conscience vote against certification as she had originally planned, citing the ""abhorrent"" invasion of the Capitol. With two weeks before Mr Trump leaves office, there are calls for him to be removed beforehand for instigating the attack on Congress. US media say somemembers of his cabinet have discussed invoking the 25th amendment to the Constitution, which deals with removing a president deemed unfit for office. Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee have said that Mr Trump's actions meet the amendment's requirements. On Wednesday afternoon protesters surged up the Capitol steps shoving past barricades and officers in riot gear to penetrate the building. The mob - some of whom wore body armour - used chemical irritants to attack police, according to Washington police. They shouted and waved pro-Trump, US and Confederate flags as they roamed the halls, demanding the results of the presidential election be overturned. Members of Congress scrambled for cover under their seats as tear gas was fired. Several thousand National Guard troops, FBI agents and US Secret Service personnel were deployed to help overwhelmed Capitol police. The apparent ease with which Trump supporters were able to act has raised serious questions about security. Two pipe bombs were recovered, one from the Democratic National Committee offices, not far from the Capitol, and one from the nearby Republican National Committee headquarters. The occupation of the Capitol lasted more than three hours before the building was secured by law enforcement. At least 52 people have been arrested, the vast majority of them for violating the 18:00 to 06:00 curfew. Washington is under an extended state of emergency until after Mr Biden's inauguration. After sitting at the desk of US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, one protester left a message reading ""we will not back down"" Responding to the violence, Mr Biden said the mob's activity ""border[ed] on sedition"" and that democracy was ""under unprecedented assault"". ""To storm the Capitol, to smash windows, to occupy offices on the floor of the United States Senate, rummaging through desks, on the House of Representatives, threatening the safety of duly elected officials. It's not protest; it's insurrection."" This video can not be played Joe Biden: The scenes of chaos at the Capitol do not reflect a true America, do not represent who we are Mr Trump posted a recorded video on Twitter saying: ""I know your pain. I know you're hurt... We had an election that was stolen from us. It was a landslide election, and everyone knows it, especially the other side. But you have to go home now. We have to have peace."" For the first time, Twitter froze Mr Trump's account, saying it would be locked for 12 hours. The social media giant demanded he delete three tweets that it said could stoke violence and threatening ""permanent suspension"". Facebook and Instagram followed suit. Hours earlier, Mr Trump had addressed a ""Save America Rally"" outside the White House, where he encouraged supporters to keep contesting the election result: ""Our country has had enough and we will not take it anymore."" Political figures from around the worldcondemned the violence.In the US, former President Barack Obama said history would rightly remember the assault on the Capitol as ""as a moment of great dishonour and shame for our nation"". Former President George W Bush said: ""It is a sickening & heartbreaking sight. This is how election results are disputed in a banana republic - not our democratic republic.""

"At least five deaths have been linked to the violence, which saw dozens of police injured With the country still reeling from Wednesday's violence in Washington, serious questions are being asked about how such a massive security breach was able to happen at the heart of US government. Crowds of pro-Trump supporters were able to force their way inside one of the country's most historically and politically significant buildings while elected lawmakers were inside moving to certify Joe Biden's election victory. The world watched as a mob of rioters seemed to roam free around inside -  looting and vandalising symbols of US democracy as they went. What does a deadly day mean for Trump's legacy? In pictures: Pro-Trump protesters storm Capitol Could Trump be removed from power? President-Elect Joe Biden has been scathing of the ""unacceptable"" handling of the rioters and compared it to the heavy-handed militarised response to last year's Black Lives Matter protests. Lindsey Graham, a Republican Senator, also railed against the security failures. ""They could have blown the building up. They could have killed us all. They could've destroyed the government,"" he said. Criticism centres on preparation by police and their failure to anticipate possible violence, despite evidence that radical pro-Trump supporters and other groups were openly discussing their plans online. This video can not be played Phone footage reveals chaotic scenes inside US Capitol The Washington Post, citing sources close to the matter,says that Capitol Police charged with guarding the building and its grounds did not make early requests for help from the city's main police force or the National Guard,externalnor set-up a multiagency command centre to coordinate response to any violence. And without an adequate security perimeter in place, their sparse police lines were quickly overwhelmed by thousands descending on the Capitol. Dozens of officers were injured, and one later died, in the effort to retake control -  including some with armour, weapons and chemical spray agents. To many, the optics were a sharp contrast to last year's protests following the death of George Floyd, when rows of National Guard Troops guarded and enforced order in the capital. The violence came against a surreal backdrop of US historical figures and scenes Even hours into Wednesday's violence, protesters were filmed being escorted or guided out of the building without arrest - even appearing to be helped down the Capitol stairs and having doors held open for them to exit. Another viral clip appeared to show a police officer posing for a selfie with a man inside. Many rioters photographed and even live-streamed their crimes. One was pictured, his face uncovered, with his feet up on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's desk, and then showing off a letter he appeared to have stolen from her office. A Confederate flag was paraded by another unmasked man and a well-known conspiracy theorist - wearing horns, fur and facepaint - was seen posing by a Senate chair that had been occupied by Vice President Mike Pence just hours earlier. Nick Ochs, a known member of the Proud Boys far-right group, tweeted a selfie of himself inside and later told CNN: ""There were thousands of people in there - [the police] had no control of the situation. I didn't get stopped or questioned."" The striking image of Richard Barnett, 60, is one of several to have gone viral But despite the severity and scale of the chaos, relatively few arrests had been made by nightfall Wednesday. A visual guide to the Congress riots 'They tried to break in - then I heard a shot' Supporters of BLM and others on the left have voiced their outrage at the perceived double-standard of policing the events. The incoming vice-president, Kamala Harris, said the disconnect was ""unacceptable"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Former First Lady Michelle Obama also released a lengthy statement,external. ""I cannot think about moving on or turning the page until we reckon with the reality of what we saw yesterday,"" she wrote. ""True progress will be possible only once we acknowledge that this disconnect exists and take steps to repair it."" Top congressional Democrats Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi were damning in their criticism of security failures - helping to force the departures of top officials. The chief of the US Capitol Police, Steven Sund, had initially defended his force in a statement on Thursday - describing the actions of law enforcement as ""heroic"" and their plan robust. But within hours his resignation was announced, alongside the departures of the sergeant-at-arms for both the House and Senate. This video can not be played 'Treason, traitors and thugs'  - the words lawmakers used to describe Capitol riot Aside from the clear lack of preparation, confusion mounted during the violence about when and if other security forces were being deployed to help. According to the Washington Post,Pentagon officials had placed strict operational limits on the DC National Guard,externalahead of protests and remained concerned about the ""optics"" of armed military personnel at the Capitol. Defence officials on Thursday sought to defend the speed in which they authorised and mobilised Guardsmen to respond to the violence. Multiple US media outlets, citing senior sources, have suggested that President Donald Trump allegedly showed reluctance for the National Guard to be used to quell the unrest. If true, this is a complete contrast to the highly visible show of force the president has repeatedly called for against left-wing and BLM protesters. Gordon Corera, the BBC's security correspondent, says this emphasises how security decisions appear to have become politicised under the Trump administration. This video can not be played US Capitol riots: How the world's media reacted Professor Clifford Stott, a specialist in the policing of crowds who advises the UK government, has been analysing the police response to BLM protests in Seattle. He told the BBC there would be ""powerful and important"" questions to be asked about how officials failed to prepared for the escalation by Trump supporters. ""It was the failure to predict that that led them to be inadequately prepared when it did happen and led them to be reactive and have to mobilise more resources,"" he said.  ""It's not just about the complexities of the police response, it's also about what appears to be a poor level of risk assessments around how they understand whether resources might be necessary in the first place."" The gathering of the president's supporters, while Congress was certifying the election result, was not spontaneous. The protest was pre-planned and followed months of escalating rhetoric from President Trump and some of his Republican allies seeking to undermine the result. This video can not be played ""We will never give up, we will never concede"", Trump tells supporters In the days (and indeed weeks and months) before the attack, people monitoring online platforms used by extreme pro-Trump supporters and far-right groups had warned of rhetoric encouraging violence at the Capitol, including toward lawmakers, over the election result. Some were even pictured wearing clothing that said ""MAGA: CIVIL WAR"" printed alongside the 6 January 2021 date. Prof Stott, who researches the psychology of group violence and hooliganism, told the BBC he found the overarching mood of ""joy"" among rioters openly committing crimes particularly interesting. ""There was a very clear purpose to that crowd and that was driven by the idea their actions were legitimate, given their perception that their president - as their commander in chief - had sanctioned them to go and do this,"" he says. ""And that sense that Capitol Hill itself had been over taken by corruption."" How could 25th amendment be used? A history of violence at the US Capitol Some appeared confused and angry at why officers had used force against them. One Yahoo News video, viewed more than 25m times on TikTok, shows a woman visibly upset that she had been maced by police, despite declaring: ""We're storming the capitol - it's a revolution!""

Some radical supporters have responded with disbelief and frustration at the concession video shared by President Trump on Thursday following the violence. The U-turn came only a day after he told supporters: ""We will never give up, we will never concede"" and openly pressured his vice-president to overturn the election result. Vice-President Mike Pence is among those who have called for those involved in the breach to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and given the brazen behaviour of many involved, prosecutors surely have no shortage of evidence to draw from. As Facebook moved to remove videos seen to incite or encourage the events, some open-source investigators called for people to archive evidence to help with crowdsourced identification. Meanwhile, many seen in viral images from inside are already known figures within far-right groups and QAnon and related conspiracy networks. Who stormed the Capitol? Dozens of people are already facing charges - including one man officials say had a semi-automatic rifle and 11 Molotov cocktails - and police have also appealed for help identifying offenders not yet in custody. Michael Sherwin, the acting US Attorney for DC, said on Thursday that prosecutors would bring ""the most maximum charges we can"", when asked if crimes such as seditious conspiracy and insurrection could be tabled. He also refused to rule out investigating anyone deemed to have incited the violence, including President Trump. ""We're trying to deal with the closest alligators to the boat right now,"" he said. ""Those are the people who obviously breached the Capitol, created violence and mayhem there and then exited. But yes, we are looking at all actors here, not only the people that went into the building.""

Just some of the terms used by members of Congress to describe those who invaded the seat of US government on Wednesday. This video can not be played The words lawmakers used to describe Capitol riot The storming of the US Capitol building in Washington DC stunned viewers around the world. But how did Americans feel seeing the seat of their government being ransacked? A new US citizen, a diehard Trump supporter, an anti-Trump Republican and a young Black Lives Matter protester - all members of our BBC voter panel - weighed in. Read what they said. Almost 60 Democratic members of the US House of Representatives have backed new articles of impeachment against the Republican president over Wednesday's unrest. Congresswoman Ilhan Omar said in a tweet on Thursday that dozens of lawmakers had offered their support to the resolution that she and other members, including Rashida Tlaib, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Cori Bush, had prepared.

Donald Trump, who leaves office on 20 January, was impeached by the Democratic-held House in 2019 after he was accused of abusing his power and obstructing Congress. He was acquitted by the Republican-led Senate. Leading Democrats have also called for the president to be removed under the 25th Amendment, which allows the vice-president to step up if the president is unable to perform his duties owing to a mental or physical illness. It would require Vice-President Mike Pence and at least eight cabinet members to break with Mr Trump and invoke the amendment - something they have so far seemed unlikely to do. In a short press briefing that ran less than two minutes, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany condemned the armed insurrection at the US Capitol ""in the strongest possible terms"". Speaking ""on behalf of the entire White House"", she called the violence ""appalling, reprehensible and antithetical to the American way"". McEnany left the briefing room without taking any questions. President Trump has not been seen in public today and his social media accounts remain suspended. Washington DC's top prosecutor has not ruled out the possibility that the president himself could be investigated over the Capitol riot. Acting attorney general for the District of Columbia, Michael Sherwin, said ""all actors"" will be looked at. Asked whether this included Trump, Sherwin responded: âWeâre looking at all actors here and anyone that had a role and, if the evidence fits the elements of the crime, theyâre going to be charged."" The president had urged his supporters at a rally outside the White House to march on Congress, while pushing unfounded claims of electoral fraud. As events spiralled out of control, he tweeted urging them to ""remain peaceful"". The Association of Flight Attendants - a labour union that represents nearly 50,000 air crew - says it is ""taking a hard line for flight safety"" after problems aboard several flights to Washington DC. Citing the Capitol riot and the possibility that some participants might soon be flying back home, AFA President Sara Nelson suggested the culprits should be banned from planes. ""Acts against our democracy, our government, and the freedom we claim as 
Americans must disqualify these individuals from the freedom of flight."" In a video that went viral on social media, Trump supporters on a packed flight to the DC area heckled Senator Mitt Romney with chants of ""Traitor"". Trump's former chief of staff, John Kelly, has said he would vote to remove the president from office if he were still part of the cabinet. ""Yes, I would,"" Kelly, who served under Trump from 2017-18, told CNN's Jake Tapper in an interview on Thursday. ""The one thing we have going for us here, Jake, is that it's only 13 more days"", he added in reference to Biden's inauguration on 20 January. Wednesday's invasion of the Capitol has revived political talk of removing Trump from office via a constitutional amendment. Here's our explainer: What is the 25th Amendment? Allow Twitter content?

Today, the Senate's top Democrat joined voices calling for Trump's presidential powers to be removed immediately after his supporters violently stormed the US Capitol on Wednesday. Under the 25th Amendment, the vice-president can become acting president when a president is unable to continue his duties, if for example, he or she becomes incapacitated due to a physical or mental illness. The part of the amendment being discussed is section four, which allows the vice-president and a majority of the cabinet to declare President Trump unable to perform his duties. Find out more about the 25th Amendment here. The day before she died, Ashli Babbitt wrote on social media about the gathering of Trump supporters in the US capital. ""Nothing will stop us,"" she wrote. ""They can try and try and try but the storm is here and it is descending upon DC in less than 24 hours."" Babbitt, 35, was among the mob that breached the US Capitol on Wednesday. She has been identified by US Capitol Police as one of four people who died amid the chaos. A veteran of the US Air Force, Babbitt served two tours in Afghanistan and Iraq before later deployments with the National Guard to Kuwait and Qatar, her ex-husband, Timothy McEntee, told US media. A native of San Diego, California, Ms Babbitt had recently remarried, and worked at a pool service company with her husband, Aaron Babbitt. On social media, Babbitt described herself as a libertarian and patriot. She posted frequently about President Trump, expressing ardent support for him and echoing his unproven claims of wide-scale voter fraud. ""She had a personality that you either loved or hated,"" McEntee told NPR. ""She wasn't apologetic about it... she was proud of it, just like she was proud of her country and proud to be an American."" Read the full story here. Former First Lady Michelle Obama said Wednesday's events at the US Capitol ""desecrated the centre of American government"". In a lengthy statement released on social media, Obama said: ""Seeing the gulf between the responses to yesterday's riot and this 
summer's peaceful protests and the larger movement for racial justice is
 so painful. It hurts."" Decrying the sight of ""the traitorous flag of the Confederacy"", she lamented the ""cracked skulls and mass arrests"" that she said had been seen at Black Lives Matter protests. ""Millions voted for a man so obviously willing to burn down our democracy for his own ego,"" she said. She called on social media platforms to ""stop enabling this monstrous behaviour"" and permanently ban Trump. Obama also urged people to engage in ""the uncomfortable, sometimes painful process"" of ""putting America back together"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

As violent Trump supporters surged past barricades and into the US Capitol, news agency photographers - who were there to document the vote certifying Joe Biden's election win - captured extraordinary scenes. The last time government buildings were breached in Washington was in 1814 and the invaders were British soldiers. But in 2021 a Trump supporter, carrying the Confederate flag, is walking freely through the halls near the entrance to the Senate, encountering little resistance. Another image showed a rioter holding a podium bearing the seal of the Speaker of the House, while a third showed a man with a boot on the desk of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Yesterday's riots took place at the US Capitol - one of the country's most important buildings. It's the area of Washington DC - the capital city of the United States - where Congress is situated. This is where the US government writes, debates and passes laws. The Hill is centred around the US Capitol building - the main location protesters broke into. This is where elected officials in the Senate and the House of Representatives sit when debating and voting on laws, making up the upper and lower chambers of Congress. As well as these chambers, there are other office buildings where lawmakers and their staff work and meet to do their business. Find out more here. With his ban on Facebook and Instagram extended, President Donald Trump was notably absent on Wednesday as the US took stock of yesterday's events at the Capitol. According to the White House, one of his tasks for the day included presenting the country's highest civilian award, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, to three golfers - among them Babe Zaharias, who was honoured posthumously. Annika Sorenstam and Gary Player also received the honour. If you're just joining our live coverage, here are the top stories of the day so far: The
 US is reeling after supporters of President Trump stormed the Capitol 
building in Washington DC on the day Congress was meeting to confirm Joe
 Biden's election victory. Lawmakers
 were forced to take shelter, the building was put into lockdown and 
four people died in the chaos that followed a pro-Trump rally near the 
White House. Here's a breakdown of how events unfolded on Wednesday. Nga PhamBBC News South Vietnam flags were seen during the unrest On Wednesday, as protesters gathered outside before
swarming the Capitol building, the
yellow flags of the old South Vietnam regime could be seen. In fact, the yellow flags of the former South Vietnam are a common sight at
pro-Trump rallies across the United States. Vietnamese Americans, especially those of the older generation who fled Vietnam after
Saigon fell in 1975, are known for their support for the Republican party and
Donald Trump. A pre-election survey by the group Asian and Pacific Islander
American Vote found thatVietnamese Americans are the only major East Asian ethnic community that favoured Trump over Biden,external. Trumpâs anti-China and anti-communist rhetoric resonated greatly with the former refugees who risked their lives to escape
communism. But the support
for President Trump has also become an increasingly divisive issue amongst the
Vietnamese American community. Hours after the
Capitol riot, there are still calls on pro-Trump internet forums like
the ""ABC Trump"" Facebook page for Vietnamese Americans to âtake to
the streets in support of President Trumpâ as âthe battle
continuesâ. But there have also been condemnations. âThis is embarrassing,â
one young Vietnamese American wrote on Twitter, adding: âTheyâve brought shame to
the flagâ. Frank GardnerBBC Security Correspondent Saudi Arabia has been a close ally of the Trump administration Jihadist supporters of both the Islamic State group (IS) and al-Qaeda have been celebrating online the scenes of chaos and violence in Washington. The extremists and proponents of violent jihad - who view the US as their number one enemy - have been sharing images and videos from Capitol Hill, mocking American democracy and expressing hope that division will spread across the country. There was no immediate comment from either groupâs leadership on their official media outlets. The events will have deeply worried Americaâs allies in the Middle East, for whom the US acts as a security guarantor. Saudi Arabiaâs leaders, who had a close relationship with the Trump administration and who waited days before congratulating President-elect Joe Biden, will now be hoping for a period of calm. Sergeant-at-arms Paul Irving, who was responsible for maintaining law and order in the US House of Representatives, has resigned. His resignation was announced by Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi at her press conference moments ago. The top Democrat also said that she is calling for the resignation of Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund, who she says has not spoken to her on the phone once since violence was unleashed on the Capitol yesterday. Earlier today, her counterpart in the Senate, Chuck Schumer, said he would fire the Senate's sergeant-at-arms once Democrats become the majority in the chamber. Members of the Washington DC National Guard protect the Capitol on Wednesday night At a press conference earlier, Washington DC's mayor described yesterday's protests as ""textbook terrorism"" and ""an affront to democracy"". Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, squarely blamed Trump for inciting the violence seen yesterday. During the press conference, police also identified all four people that died during the chaos. Ashli Babbitt, a 35-year-old military veteran from California, was shot by a plainclothes Capitol police officer, according to Washington DC Police Chief Robert Contee. Benjamin Phillips, 50, Kevin Greeson, 55, and Rosanne Boyland, 34, also died after suffering ""medical emergencies"", he said. The three travelled from Pennsylvania, Alabama and Georgia respectively. This video can not be played Pelosi: 'President incited armed insurrection against US' Top Democrat Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House of Representatives, is giving a news conference now where she says she has a message for Trump's cabinet members. ""Do they stand by these actions? Are they ready to say for the next 13 days that this dangerous man can do more harm to our democracy?"" Pelosi goes on to say that the House may be forced to file of articles of impeachment due to Trump's recent ""seditious acts"". ""Although it's only 13 days left, any day could be a horror show,"" she tells reporters. Pelosi adds that Democrats are contacting her, demanding another attempt to remove Trump from office. To remind you, Trump has already been impeached once, by the Democrat-led House in December 2019 over allegations he improperly sought help from Ukraine to boost his chances of re-election. If impeached again, he would be the first president in US history to be impeached twice. ""My phone is exploding with 'impeach impeach impeach',"" she says. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played When a mob stormed the US capitol US President Donald Trump's opponents in the two houses of Congress have called for him to be removed from office after the violent invasion of the Capitol by a mob of his supporters. Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer said Mr Trump should be removed immediately. If he is not, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says he could be impeached. Removal would need Republican support and only a few have so far backed it. In a video speech, Mr Trump said he was committed to an ""orderly"" transition. The president said a new administration would be inaugurated on 20 January, and called for ""healing and reconciliation"". He also said he was ""outraged by the violence, lawlessness and mayhem"" on Wednesday and that ""tempers must be cooled and calm restored"". The video was shared on his Twitter account, which was reactivated on Thursday after being suspended following the Capitol riot. At least four people died during the unrest, and 68 have now been arrested. The actions of the police have come under scrutiny, with officers facing criticism for failing to stop the rioters breaking in. The official responsible for security in the House of Representatives, the sergeant at arms, has resigned. Reports say US Capitol Police (USCP) chief Steven Sund is also resigning, effective 16 January, following calls from Ms Pelosi. Mr Schumer has called for his counterpart in the Senate to be sacked. Transport Secretary Elaine Chao is the latest member of the Trump administration to quit in protest over the riots. Several lower-level officials have also resigned. Questions mount over security failure The US Air Force veteran who lost her life in riots Johnson condemns Trump over US Capitol siege President-elect Joe Biden said: ""Nobody could tell me that if it was a group of Black Lives Matter protesters yesterday they wouldn't have been treated very differently than the thugs that stormed the Capitol."" This video can not be played Joe Biden: Black Lives Matter protesters would have been treated ""differently"" A growing number have called for Mr Trump to be removed as president. Most of them are from Mr Biden's Democratic Party but a few Republicans have joined in. ""This president should not hold office one day longer,"" said Mr Schumer, who will lead the Democratic majority in the Senate when it begins its new session later this month. What does a deadly day mean for Trump's legacy? 'They tried to break in - then I heard a shot' Who broke into the building? He urged Mr Trump's cabinet to remove him from office using the 25th Amendment to the US Constitution, which allows the vice-president to step up if the president is unable to perform his duties owing to a mental or physical illness. It would require Vice-President Mike Pence and at least eight cabinet members to break with Mr Trump and invoke the amendment - something they have so far seemed unlikely to do. Ms Pelosi described Mr Trump as ""a very dangerous person"" and said: ""This is an emergency of the highest magnitude."" She left open the option of impeachment if Mr Trump's colleagues did not start 25th Amendment proceedings. However, the Democrats would need to rely on the support of Republicans to secure the necessary two-thirds majority in the Senate to convict Mr Trump under the articles of impeachment in the constitution, and would be unlikely to get those numbers. A visual guide to the storming of Congress Congressman Adam Kinzinger from Illinois was one of the first Republicans to call for use of the 25th Amendment, saying: ""Fires stoked by the president finally leapt out of the pan."" This video can not be played Phone footage reveals chaotic scenes inside US Capitol The Republican governors of Maryland and Vermont have also called for Mr Trump to be removed from office. Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee have said that Mr Trump's actions meet the amendment's requirements. Separately, both the House and the Senate have adjourned until after Mr Biden is sworn in on 20 January. Both houses would have to be recalled in order to start impeachment proceedings. In pictures: Pro-Trump protesters storm Capitol Facebook blocks Trump 'until transition complete' Several Trump administration officials have now resigned over the riots - Elaine Chao is the most high-profile. Ms Chao, who has served through the whole presidency and is married to the top Senate Republican, Mitch McConnell, said the events had ""deeply troubled me in a way that I simply cannot set aside"". Others to quit include special envoy Mick Mulvaney, a senior national security official, and the chief of staff to First Lady Melania Trump. A State Department adviser was also sacked after calling Mr Trump ""unfit for office"" in a tweet. The president is also facing new restrictions on his use of social media. Facebook, which owns Instagram, has suspended him from both platforms at least until he leaves office and possibly indefinitely. Twitter suspended his account for 12 hours. The 25th Amendment, enacted in 1967, was designed to provide a more detailed process for the succession of presidential power. The writers envisioned national catastrophes or a medically incapacitated president as situations the amendment could address. It was not contemplated, at least initially, as a means to drag a president who is viewed as a threat to the nation from office. That, however, is exactly what many Democrats - including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi - are suggesting should happen to Donald Trump. It's what one current Republican congressman, Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, is calling for and what one of Trump's former White House chiefs of staff, John Kelly, said he supported. With just 13 days left in the Trump presidency, the unprecedented step of stripping an unwilling president of power, which requires the consent of the vice-president and a majority of the 15-member presidential cabinet, seems unlikely. But the report that such steps are being contemplated underline the gravity of the current situation. Democrats are also once again talking about impeachment and conviction by the Senate, a process that would take more time but would, as an additional benefit in their minds, prohibit Mr Trump from running for office in the future. Police have been heavily criticised for their response to the violence. Images captured inside the Capitol building showed rioters strolling through some of the corridors unimpeded. One man occupied Ms Pelosi's office, putting his feet up on her desk, while another was photographed walking out carrying a lectern. Police stand guard during the curfew overnight on Wednesday Washington police say 68 people have so far been arrested, only one of them from the DC area. One USCP officer has been placed on leave after a woman was shot dead on the floor of the House of Representatives. The woman, who has been named as air force veteran Ashli Babbitt, 35, was part of a group that forced its way into the chamber while it was still in session. Police said three other people - 50-year-old Benjamin Philips from Pennsylvania; 55-year-old Kevin Greeson from Alabama; and 34-year-old Rosanne Boyland from Georgia - died of unspecified ""medical emergencies"". Mr Greeson's family said he died of a heart attack. The FBI is seeking to identify those involved in the rampage. The Department of Justice says those arrested could face charges of seditious conspiracy, as well as rioting and insurrection. One of those detained at the Capitol had a ""military-style automatic weapon and 11 Molotov cocktails (petrol bombs)"", according to the federal attorney for Washington DC. On Thursday, crews began installing a non-scalable 7ft (2m) fence around the Capitol. It will remain in place for at least 30 days. Michelle Obama, wife of Mr Trump's presidential predecessor, Barack Obama, released a statement calling attention to the racial disparity in the way different protests were policed. She described Mr Trump as ""an infantile and unpatriotic president"", and said it would be impossible to move on until there was a reckoning with Wednesday's events. ""Yesterday made it painfully clear that certain Americans are, in fact, allowed to denigrate the flag and symbols of our nation. They've just got to look the right way,"" she wrote. This video can not be played 'Treason, traitors and thugs'  - the words lawmakers used to describe Capitol riot The New York Times reported, quoting unnamed sources, that Mr Trump was considering granting a pardon to himself in the final days of his presidency.

"Jamie Stiehm is a US political columnist who was in the Capitol building in Washington DC  when it was stormed by pro-Trump rioters. Here's what she saw from the press gallery in the House of Representatives. I had told my sister earlier: ""Something bad is going to happen today. I don't know what, but something bad will happen."" Outside the Capitol, I encountered a group of very boisterous supporters of President Donald Trump, all waving flags and pledging their allegiance to him. There was a sense that trouble was brewing. I went inside to the House of Representatives and up into the press gallery, where we were assigned seats, looking down at the rather sombre gathering. Speaker Nancy Pelosi was holding the gavel, and keeping people to their five-minute statements. In pictures: Pro-Trump protesters storm Capitol What does a deadly day means for Trump's legacy? As we went into the second hour, all of a sudden we heard breaking glass. The air began getting fogged. An announcement from the Capitol Police said, ""An individual has breached the building"". So everyone looked around and then it was business as usual. But after that, the announcements kept coming. And they were getting more and more urgent. They announced that the intruders had breached the rotunda, which is under the famed marble dome. The sacred house of democracy was under fire. Jamie Stiehm is a US political columnist Many of us are hardened journalists - I've seen my share of violence covering homicides in Baltimore - but this was very unpredictable. The police didn't seem to know what was happening. They weren't coordinated. They locked the chamber doors but at the same time, they told us we would have to evacuate. So there was a sense of panic. I was afraid. I'll tell you that. And I've spoken to other journalists who said they were a little ashamed of themselves for feeling afraid. There was a sense of ""nobody's in charge here, the Capitol Police have lost control of the building, anything can happen"". If you think back to the September 11 attacks in 2001, there was one plane that went down and didn't hit its target. That target was the Capitol. There were echoes of that. I made a call to my family, just to let them know that I was here and it was a dangerous situation. There was a shot. We could see there was a standoff in our chamber. Five men were holding guns at the door. It was a frightening sight. Men were looking through a broken glass window and looked like they could shoot at any second. Thankfully there was no gunfire inside the chamber. But for a while there, it felt like it would be a real possibility. Because things were going downhill very fast. We had to crawl under railings to get out of the way. I was not dressed to do that. A lot of women were dressed up, wearing heels, because they had come for a formal ritual. I sheltered in the House cafeteria alongside others. I'm still shaking now. I have seen a lot as a journalist, but this was something more. This was the collective public sphere being undermined, assaulted, degraded. And I think this was why the Speaker wanted to return and hold the gavel again and go on. Afterwards I had to decide whether I was going to go back to the chamber too. I decided l probably would, because the message that is sending is: ""You can incite a mob, but we're going to go on"". I think that is a very important political message. As told to Jessica Lussenhop. This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.

"US President Donald Trump has less than two weeks left in office, but the Senate's top Democrat has called for his presidential powers to be removed immediately after his supporters violently stormed the US Capitol on Wednesday. ""What happened at the US Capitol yesterday was an insurrection against the United States, incited by the president. This president should not hold office one day longer,"" Senator Chuck Schumer said in a statement. He added that Mike Pence should invoke the 25th Amendment, which allows for a transfer of power from the president to the vice-president, either temporarily or permanently. ""If the vice-president and the cabinet refuse to stand up, Congress should reconvene to impeach the president,"" he said. Democrats of the House Judiciary Committee have also written a letter to Vice-President Pence urging him to act to remove Donald Trump from office, saying he had stoked an act of insurrection and ""sought to undermine our democracy"".

In pictures: Pro-Trump protesters storm Capitol 'They tried to break in - then I heard a shot' The 25th Amendment allows the vice-president to become acting president when a president is unable to continue his duties, if for example, he or she becomes incapacitated due to a physical or mental illness. The part of the amendment being discussed is section four, which allows the vice-president and a majority of the cabinet to declare President Trump unable to perform his duties. Vice-President Mike Pence (L) would take over as acting president if Donald Trump's powers are removed They would need to sign a letter to the speaker of the House of Representatives and the presiding officer of the Senate declaring the president is unfit to govern or incapable ""of discharging the powers and duties of his office"".  At this point, Vice-President Mike Pence would automatically take over. The president is given the chance to offer a written response, and if he contests the finding, then it falls on Congress to decide. Any vote in the Senate and House of Representatives ordering the president's removal requires a two-thirds majority. Until the issue is resolved, the vice-president would act as president. Nancy Pelosi introduced legislation based on the 25th Amendment after President Trump's Covid-19 diagnosis Discussions about invoking the 25th Amendment also arose after President Trump's Covid-19 diagnosis in October last year, amid concern he may be too sick to run the country. What happens when a US president is too sick to work? Around the same time, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi introduced legislation based on the 25th Amendment that created a commission to review a president's fitness for office. The 25th Amendment was ratified in 1967, four years after the assassination of John F Kennedy, and was intended to address questions of presidential succession if a president becomes incapacitated. Republican President Ronald Reagan transferred powers to his vice-president for eight hours in 1985 whilst having surgery for cancer And for this reason, a number of presidents have used the amendment - specifically section three - which allows them to temporarily hand over power to their vice-presidents. In 2002 and 2007, President George W Bush placed his vice-president in charge when he was sedated during routine colonoscopies. President Ronald Reagan did the same in 1985 when he was in hospital for cancer surgery. But to date, no sitting president has ever been permanently removed using the 25th Amendment. There have been calls for President Trump to be impeached for a second time. Minnesota Democratic Congresswoman Ilhan Omar announced she was drawing up articles of impeachment against him, with a growing number of fellow Democrats voicing their support. Allow Twitter content?

Donald Trump has already been impeached once - by the Democrat-led House in December 2019 over allegations he improperly sought help from Ukraine to boost his chances of re-election. He faced two charges - abuse of power and the obstruction of Congress - but was later acquitted by the Republican-led Senate. He is only the third US president in history to have been impeached. Trump impeachment: The short, medium and long story To impeach means to bring charges in Congress that will form the basis for a trial. The US constitution states a president ""shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes or misdemeanours"". It is a political process, rather than a criminal one. It happens in two stages - articles are brought to the House of Representatives where, if passed, they proceed to the Senate for a trial. But here, a two-thirds vote is necessary for a president's removal - and this milestone has never been reached in US history. If President Trump were replaced through the impeachment process, Vice-President Mike Pence would move into the Oval Office. No president has ever been impeached twice during his time in office. Questions remain as to whether there would be enough time to impeach Donald Trump before his term ends on 20 January, when President-elect Joe Biden is inaugurated.

Just some of the terms used by members of Congress to describe those who invaded the seat of US government on Wednesday. This video can not be played The words lawmakers used to describe Capitol riot The storming of the US Capitol building in Washington DC stunned viewers around the world. But how did Americans feel seeing the seat of their government being ransacked? A new US citizen, a diehard Trump supporter, an anti-Trump Republican and a young Black Lives Matter protester - all members of our BBC voter panel - weighed in. Read what they said. Almost 60 Democratic members of the US House of Representatives have backed new articles of impeachment against the Republican president over Wednesday's unrest. Congresswoman Ilhan Omar said in a tweet on Thursday that dozens of lawmakers had offered their support to the resolution that she and other members, including Rashida Tlaib, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Cori Bush, had prepared.

Donald Trump, who leaves office on 20 January, was impeached by the Democratic-held House in 2019 after he was accused of abusing his power and obstructing Congress. He was acquitted by the Republican-led Senate. Leading Democrats have also called for the president to be removed under the 25th Amendment, which allows the vice-president to step up if the president is unable to perform his duties owing to a mental or physical illness. It would require Vice-President Mike Pence and at least eight cabinet members to break with Mr Trump and invoke the amendment - something they have so far seemed unlikely to do. In a short press briefing that ran less than two minutes, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany condemned the armed insurrection at the US Capitol ""in the strongest possible terms"". Speaking ""on behalf of the entire White House"", she called the violence ""appalling, reprehensible and antithetical to the American way"". McEnany left the briefing room without taking any questions. President Trump has not been seen in public today and his social media accounts remain suspended. Washington DC's top prosecutor has not ruled out the possibility that the president himself could be investigated over the Capitol riot. Acting attorney general for the District of Columbia, Michael Sherwin, said ""all actors"" will be looked at. Asked whether this included Trump, Sherwin responded: âWeâre looking at all actors here and anyone that had a role and, if the evidence fits the elements of the crime, theyâre going to be charged."" The president had urged his supporters at a rally outside the White House to march on Congress, while pushing unfounded claims of electoral fraud. As events spiralled out of control, he tweeted urging them to ""remain peaceful"". The Association of Flight Attendants - a labour union that represents nearly 50,000 air crew - says it is ""taking a hard line for flight safety"" after problems aboard several flights to Washington DC. Citing the Capitol riot and the possibility that some participants might soon be flying back home, AFA President Sara Nelson suggested the culprits should be banned from planes. ""Acts against our democracy, our government, and the freedom we claim as 
Americans must disqualify these individuals from the freedom of flight."" In a video that went viral on social media, Trump supporters on a packed flight to the DC area heckled Senator Mitt Romney with chants of ""Traitor"". Trump's former chief of staff, John Kelly, has said he would vote to remove the president from office if he were still part of the cabinet. ""Yes, I would,"" Kelly, who served under Trump from 2017-18, told CNN's Jake Tapper in an interview on Thursday. ""The one thing we have going for us here, Jake, is that it's only 13 more days"", he added in reference to Biden's inauguration on 20 January. Wednesday's invasion of the Capitol has revived political talk of removing Trump from office via a constitutional amendment. Here's our explainer: What is the 25th Amendment? Allow Twitter content?

Today, the Senate's top Democrat joined voices calling for Trump's presidential powers to be removed immediately after his supporters violently stormed the US Capitol on Wednesday. Under the 25th Amendment, the vice-president can become acting president when a president is unable to continue his duties, if for example, he or she becomes incapacitated due to a physical or mental illness. The part of the amendment being discussed is section four, which allows the vice-president and a majority of the cabinet to declare President Trump unable to perform his duties. Find out more about the 25th Amendment here. The day before she died, Ashli Babbitt wrote on social media about the gathering of Trump supporters in the US capital. ""Nothing will stop us,"" she wrote. ""They can try and try and try but the storm is here and it is descending upon DC in less than 24 hours."" Babbitt, 35, was among the mob that breached the US Capitol on Wednesday. She has been identified by US Capitol Police as one of four people who died amid the chaos. A veteran of the US Air Force, Babbitt served two tours in Afghanistan and Iraq before later deployments with the National Guard to Kuwait and Qatar, her ex-husband, Timothy McEntee, told US media. A native of San Diego, California, Ms Babbitt had recently remarried, and worked at a pool service company with her husband, Aaron Babbitt. On social media, Babbitt described herself as a libertarian and patriot. She posted frequently about President Trump, expressing ardent support for him and echoing his unproven claims of wide-scale voter fraud. ""She had a personality that you either loved or hated,"" McEntee told NPR. ""She wasn't apologetic about it... she was proud of it, just like she was proud of her country and proud to be an American."" Read the full story here. Former First Lady Michelle Obama said Wednesday's events at the US Capitol ""desecrated the centre of American government"". In a lengthy statement released on social media, Obama said: ""Seeing the gulf between the responses to yesterday's riot and this 
summer's peaceful protests and the larger movement for racial justice is
 so painful. It hurts."" Decrying the sight of ""the traitorous flag of the Confederacy"", she lamented the ""cracked skulls and mass arrests"" that she said had been seen at Black Lives Matter protests. ""Millions voted for a man so obviously willing to burn down our democracy for his own ego,"" she said. She called on social media platforms to ""stop enabling this monstrous behaviour"" and permanently ban Trump. Obama also urged people to engage in ""the uncomfortable, sometimes painful process"" of ""putting America back together"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

As violent Trump supporters surged past barricades and into the US Capitol, news agency photographers - who were there to document the vote certifying Joe Biden's election win - captured extraordinary scenes. The last time government buildings were breached in Washington was in 1814 and the invaders were British soldiers. But in 2021 a Trump supporter, carrying the Confederate flag, is walking freely through the halls near the entrance to the Senate, encountering little resistance. Another image showed a rioter holding a podium bearing the seal of the Speaker of the House, while a third showed a man with a boot on the desk of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Yesterday's riots took place at the US Capitol - one of the country's most important buildings. It's the area of Washington DC - the capital city of the United States - where Congress is situated. This is where the US government writes, debates and passes laws. The Hill is centred around the US Capitol building - the main location protesters broke into. This is where elected officials in the Senate and the House of Representatives sit when debating and voting on laws, making up the upper and lower chambers of Congress. As well as these chambers, there are other office buildings where lawmakers and their staff work and meet to do their business. Find out more here. With his ban on Facebook and Instagram extended, President Donald Trump was notably absent on Wednesday as the US took stock of yesterday's events at the Capitol. According to the White House, one of his tasks for the day included presenting the country's highest civilian award, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, to three golfers - among them Babe Zaharias, who was honoured posthumously. Annika Sorenstam and Gary Player also received the honour. If you're just joining our live coverage, here are the top stories of the day so far: The
 US is reeling after supporters of President Trump stormed the Capitol 
building in Washington DC on the day Congress was meeting to confirm Joe
 Biden's election victory. Lawmakers
 were forced to take shelter, the building was put into lockdown and 
four people died in the chaos that followed a pro-Trump rally near the 
White House. Here's a breakdown of how events unfolded on Wednesday. Nga PhamBBC News South Vietnam flags were seen during the unrest On Wednesday, as protesters gathered outside before
swarming the Capitol building, the
yellow flags of the old South Vietnam regime could be seen. In fact, the yellow flags of the former South Vietnam are a common sight at
pro-Trump rallies across the United States. Vietnamese Americans, especially those of the older generation who fled Vietnam after
Saigon fell in 1975, are known for their support for the Republican party and
Donald Trump. A pre-election survey by the group Asian and Pacific Islander
American Vote found thatVietnamese Americans are the only major East Asian ethnic community that favoured Trump over Biden,external. Trumpâs anti-China and anti-communist rhetoric resonated greatly with the former refugees who risked their lives to escape
communism. But the support
for President Trump has also become an increasingly divisive issue amongst the
Vietnamese American community. Hours after the
Capitol riot, there are still calls on pro-Trump internet forums like
the ""ABC Trump"" Facebook page for Vietnamese Americans to âtake to
the streets in support of President Trumpâ as âthe battle
continuesâ. But there have also been condemnations. âThis is embarrassing,â
one young Vietnamese American wrote on Twitter, adding: âTheyâve brought shame to
the flagâ. Frank GardnerBBC Security Correspondent Saudi Arabia has been a close ally of the Trump administration Jihadist supporters of both the Islamic State group (IS) and al-Qaeda have been celebrating online the scenes of chaos and violence in Washington. The extremists and proponents of violent jihad - who view the US as their number one enemy - have been sharing images and videos from Capitol Hill, mocking American democracy and expressing hope that division will spread across the country. There was no immediate comment from either groupâs leadership on their official media outlets. The events will have deeply worried Americaâs allies in the Middle East, for whom the US acts as a security guarantor. Saudi Arabiaâs leaders, who had a close relationship with the Trump administration and who waited days before congratulating President-elect Joe Biden, will now be hoping for a period of calm. Sergeant-at-arms Paul Irving, who was responsible for maintaining law and order in the US House of Representatives, has resigned. His resignation was announced by Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi at her press conference moments ago. The top Democrat also said that she is calling for the resignation of Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund, who she says has not spoken to her on the phone once since violence was unleashed on the Capitol yesterday. Earlier today, her counterpart in the Senate, Chuck Schumer, said he would fire the Senate's sergeant-at-arms once Democrats become the majority in the chamber. Members of the Washington DC National Guard protect the Capitol on Wednesday night At a press conference earlier, Washington DC's mayor described yesterday's protests as ""textbook terrorism"" and ""an affront to democracy"". Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, squarely blamed Trump for inciting the violence seen yesterday. During the press conference, police also identified all four people that died during the chaos. Ashli Babbitt, a 35-year-old military veteran from California, was shot by a plainclothes Capitol police officer, according to Washington DC Police Chief Robert Contee. Benjamin Phillips, 50, Kevin Greeson, 55, and Rosanne Boyland, 34, also died after suffering ""medical emergencies"", he said. The three travelled from Pennsylvania, Alabama and Georgia respectively. This video can not be played Pelosi: 'President incited armed insurrection against US' Top Democrat Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House of Representatives, is giving a news conference now where she says she has a message for Trump's cabinet members. ""Do they stand by these actions? Are they ready to say for the next 13 days that this dangerous man can do more harm to our democracy?"" Pelosi goes on to say that the House may be forced to file of articles of impeachment due to Trump's recent ""seditious acts"". ""Although it's only 13 days left, any day could be a horror show,"" she tells reporters. Pelosi adds that Democrats are contacting her, demanding another attempt to remove Trump from office. To remind you, Trump has already been impeached once, by the Democrat-led House in December 2019 over allegations he improperly sought help from Ukraine to boost his chances of re-election. If impeached again, he would be the first president in US history to be impeached twice. ""My phone is exploding with 'impeach impeach impeach',"" she says. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Shijiazhuang authorities have started mass-testing residents following an outbreak in the city China has placed 11 million people in the northern city of Shijiazhuang under lockdown after more than 100 new Covid cases were confirmed there. Residents are banned from leaving the city and schools have also been closed. More than 5,000 testing sites have been set up so every resident can be tested. The new figures are the highest China has seen in more than five months. The country has been able to contain such outbreaks by immediately taking tough action. This has involved consistently using mass testing when new clusters of cases appear, even if they seem relatively small. Hebei province, where Shijiazhuang is located, reported 120 new cases on Thursday and all but one of those infections was in the city.Â Elsewhere in the country, 22 new cases were confirmed.Â The virus was first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019 before spiralling into a global pandemic. Thursday's lockdown comes just weeks ahead of Chinese New Year, a time when people in China travel en masse to spend the holiday with their families. How Wuhan went from quiet streets to packed pools Did China test a whole city in 10 days? But residents in the Gaocheng district of Shijiazhuang, considered to be the epicentre of the outbreak, are now not allowed to leave their local area. Other residents are banned from leaving the city. In terms of transport, bus travel has been halted and many flights have been cancelled. Residents have been banned from leaving the city In a sign of just how seriously the authorities see the situation, even the postal service in and out of Shijiazhuang has been suspended for three days. And the restrictions are being tightly enforced - police were photographed in protective hazmat suits guarding the entrance to an expressway. Three officials in Shijiazhuang's Gaocheng districthave been punished for ""negligence"",,externalaccording to the state-run China Daily newspaper. ""Villages should identify, report, isolate and treat cases as early as possible, so as to cut off the transmission,"" Wu Hao, a national health official, was quoted as saying. Five hospitals in Shijiazhuang have been cleared for Covid-19 patients, with three others standing by, the city's Vice-Mayor Meng Xianghong said. Thursday's lockdown comes just weeks ahead of Chinese New Year - a time when families gather It is not the first time China has locked down a city in response to a cluster of cases since the outbreak in Wuhan. In October, all nine million residents of the Chinese city of Qingdaowere tested in five days after a dozen cases were confirmed. The cases were linked to a hospital treating coronavirus patients arriving from abroad. The same month, authorities in Kashgar, in Xinjiang,tested around 4.7m people after an outbreak there.

"Elon Musk has become the world's richest person, as his net worth crossed $185bn (Â£136bn). The Tesla and SpaceX entrepreneur was pushed into the top slot after Tesla's share price increased on Thursday. He takes the top spot from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, who had held it since 2017. Mr Musk's electric car company Tesla has surged in value this year, and hit a market value of $700bn (Â£516bn) for the first time on Wednesday. That makes the car company worth more than Toyota, Volkswagen, Hyundai, GM and Ford combined. Elon Musk's six secrets to business success Tech Tent: Is Tesla really worth $500 billion? Mr Musk reacted to the news in signature style, replying to a Twitter user sharing the news with the remark ""how strange"". An older tweet pinned to the top of his feed offered further insight into his thoughts on personal wealth. ""About half my money is intended to help problems on Earth, and half to help establish a self-sustaining city on Mars to ensure continuation of life (of all species) in case Earth gets hit by a meteor like the dinosaurs or WW3 happens and we destroy ourselves,"" it reads. The tycoon's fortunes have been buoyed by politics in the US, where the Democrats will have control of the US Senate in the forthcoming session. Daniel Ives, an analyst with Wedbush Securities wrote: ""A Blue Senate is very bullish and a potential 'game changer' for Tesla and the overall electric vehicle sector, with a more green-driven agenda now certainly in the cards for the next few years."" Expected electric vehicle tax credits would benefit Tesla, ""which continues to have an iron grip on the market today"", he added. Mr Bezos is also using his personal wealth to fund space exploration Mr Bezos has also seen his fortunes rise over the past year. The coronavirus pandemic has meant Amazon benefited from stronger demand for both its online store and cloud computing services. However, he gave a 4% stake in the business to his ex-wife MacKenzie Scott after they split, which helped Mr Musk overtake him. In addition, the threat of regulation has meant Amazon's stock has not risen as high as it might otherwise have done. This video can not be played Who is Elon Musk? Meet the meme-loving magnate behind SpaceX and Tesla...published in 2021 The owner of a business which has only just made its first annual profit and is still a minnow compared to the likes of Toyota  - or Amazon - is now the world's richest person. It is the fact that Tesla's share price has increased more than seven-fold in the past year that has sent Elon Musk's fortune rocketing past that of Jeff Bezos. To believe the electric car-maker's worth could rise so rapidly in just 12 months is the ultimate example of irrational exuberance. It means that Musk will have to show within the next five years that Tesla can make more profits than just about the whole of the rest of the motor industry combined to justify the valuation. Mind you, his many fans will point out that the somewhat eccentric tycoon has constantly confounded the sceptics who bet that he would go bust. And of course 20 years ago another tech visionary was staring disaster in the face when the dot com bubble burst and big profits seemed a distant dream - but Jeff Bezos went on to make those who bet on Amazon very rich indeed.

"This video can not be played When a mob stormed the US capitol US President Donald Trump's opponents in the two houses of Congress have called for him to be removed from office after the violent invasion of the Capitol by a mob of his supporters. Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer said Mr Trump should be removed immediately. If he is not, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says he could be impeached. Removal would need Republican support and only a few have so far backed it. In a video speech, Mr Trump said he was committed to an ""orderly"" transition. The president said a new administration would be inaugurated on 20 January, and called for ""healing and reconciliation"". He also said he was ""outraged by the violence, lawlessness and mayhem"" on Wednesday and that ""tempers must be cooled and calm restored"". The video was shared on his Twitter account, which was reactivated on Thursday after being suspended following the Capitol riot. At least four people died during the unrest, and 68 have now been arrested. The actions of the police have come under scrutiny, with officers facing criticism for failing to stop the rioters breaking in. The official responsible for security in the House of Representatives, the sergeant at arms, has resigned. Reports say US Capitol Police (USCP) chief Steven Sund is also resigning, effective 16 January, following calls from Ms Pelosi. Mr Schumer has called for his counterpart in the Senate to be sacked. Transport Secretary Elaine Chao is the latest member of the Trump administration to quit in protest over the riots. Several lower-level officials have also resigned. Questions mount over security failure The US Air Force veteran who lost her life in riots Johnson condemns Trump over US Capitol siege President-elect Joe Biden said: ""Nobody could tell me that if it was a group of Black Lives Matter protesters yesterday they wouldn't have been treated very differently than the thugs that stormed the Capitol."" This video can not be played Joe Biden: Black Lives Matter protesters would have been treated ""differently"" A growing number have called for Mr Trump to be removed as president. Most of them are from Mr Biden's Democratic Party but a few Republicans have joined in. ""This president should not hold office one day longer,"" said Mr Schumer, who will lead the Democratic majority in the Senate when it begins its new session later this month. What does a deadly day mean for Trump's legacy? 'They tried to break in - then I heard a shot' Who broke into the building? He urged Mr Trump's cabinet to remove him from office using the 25th Amendment to the US Constitution, which allows the vice-president to step up if the president is unable to perform his duties owing to a mental or physical illness. It would require Vice-President Mike Pence and at least eight cabinet members to break with Mr Trump and invoke the amendment - something they have so far seemed unlikely to do. Ms Pelosi described Mr Trump as ""a very dangerous person"" and said: ""This is an emergency of the highest magnitude."" She left open the option of impeachment if Mr Trump's colleagues did not start 25th Amendment proceedings. However, the Democrats would need to rely on the support of Republicans to secure the necessary two-thirds majority in the Senate to convict Mr Trump under the articles of impeachment in the constitution, and would be unlikely to get those numbers. A visual guide to the storming of Congress Congressman Adam Kinzinger from Illinois was one of the first Republicans to call for use of the 25th Amendment, saying: ""Fires stoked by the president finally leapt out of the pan."" This video can not be played Phone footage reveals chaotic scenes inside US Capitol The Republican governors of Maryland and Vermont have also called for Mr Trump to be removed from office. Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee have said that Mr Trump's actions meet the amendment's requirements. Separately, both the House and the Senate have adjourned until after Mr Biden is sworn in on 20 January. Both houses would have to be recalled in order to start impeachment proceedings. In pictures: Pro-Trump protesters storm Capitol Facebook blocks Trump 'until transition complete' Several Trump administration officials have now resigned over the riots - Elaine Chao is the most high-profile. Ms Chao, who has served through the whole presidency and is married to the top Senate Republican, Mitch McConnell, said the events had ""deeply troubled me in a way that I simply cannot set aside"". Others to quit include special envoy Mick Mulvaney, a senior national security official, and the chief of staff to First Lady Melania Trump. A State Department adviser was also sacked after calling Mr Trump ""unfit for office"" in a tweet. The president is also facing new restrictions on his use of social media. Facebook, which owns Instagram, has suspended him from both platforms at least until he leaves office and possibly indefinitely. Twitter suspended his account for 12 hours. The 25th Amendment, enacted in 1967, was designed to provide a more detailed process for the succession of presidential power. The writers envisioned national catastrophes or a medically incapacitated president as situations the amendment could address. It was not contemplated, at least initially, as a means to drag a president who is viewed as a threat to the nation from office. That, however, is exactly what many Democrats - including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi - are suggesting should happen to Donald Trump. It's what one current Republican congressman, Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, is calling for and what one of Trump's former White House chiefs of staff, John Kelly, said he supported. With just 13 days left in the Trump presidency, the unprecedented step of stripping an unwilling president of power, which requires the consent of the vice-president and a majority of the 15-member presidential cabinet, seems unlikely. But the report that such steps are being contemplated underline the gravity of the current situation. Democrats are also once again talking about impeachment and conviction by the Senate, a process that would take more time but would, as an additional benefit in their minds, prohibit Mr Trump from running for office in the future. Police have been heavily criticised for their response to the violence. Images captured inside the Capitol building showed rioters strolling through some of the corridors unimpeded. One man occupied Ms Pelosi's office, putting his feet up on her desk, while another was photographed walking out carrying a lectern. Police stand guard during the curfew overnight on Wednesday Washington police say 68 people have so far been arrested, only one of them from the DC area. One USCP officer has been placed on leave after a woman was shot dead on the floor of the House of Representatives. The woman, who has been named as air force veteran Ashli Babbitt, 35, was part of a group that forced its way into the chamber while it was still in session. Police said three other people - 50-year-old Benjamin Philips from Pennsylvania; 55-year-old Kevin Greeson from Alabama; and 34-year-old Rosanne Boyland from Georgia - died of unspecified ""medical emergencies"". Mr Greeson's family said he died of a heart attack. The FBI is seeking to identify those involved in the rampage. The Department of Justice says those arrested could face charges of seditious conspiracy, as well as rioting and insurrection. One of those detained at the Capitol had a ""military-style automatic weapon and 11 Molotov cocktails (petrol bombs)"", according to the federal attorney for Washington DC. On Thursday, crews began installing a non-scalable 7ft (2m) fence around the Capitol. It will remain in place for at least 30 days. Michelle Obama, wife of Mr Trump's presidential predecessor, Barack Obama, released a statement calling attention to the racial disparity in the way different protests were policed. She described Mr Trump as ""an infantile and unpatriotic president"", and said it would be impossible to move on until there was a reckoning with Wednesday's events. ""Yesterday made it painfully clear that certain Americans are, in fact, allowed to denigrate the flag and symbols of our nation. They've just got to look the right way,"" she wrote.

"This video can not be played Trump has tweeted a video finally condemning the Capitol rioters US President Donald Trump has been allowed to Tweet again, after being locked out of his account for 12 hours. Posting a more conciliatory message, he refrained from reiterating false claims of voter fraud. Twitter said that it would ban Mr Trump ""permanently"" if he breached the platform's rules again. The move from Twitter puts clear water between it and Facebook, which suspended him ""indefinitely"" on Thursday. Twitter has instead given the outgoing president a final warning. Earlier on Thursday, the popular gaming platform Twitch also placed an indefinite ban on Mr Trump's channel, which he has used for rally broadcasts. Mr Trump tweeted several message on Wednesday, calling the people who stormed Capitol Hill ""patriots"". He also said ""We love you."" This video can not be played When a mob stormed the US capitol A spokesperson for Twitter said: ""After the Tweets were removed and the subsequent 12-hour period expired, access to @realDonaldTrump was restored. ""Any future violations of the Twitter Rules, including our Civic Integrity or Violent Threats policies, will result in permanent suspension of the @realDonaldTrump account."" Earlier in the day, the president was suspended from Facebook and Instagram. That suspension will be reviewed after the transition of power to Joe Biden on 20 January. The social network had originally imposed a 24-hour ban after the US Capitol attack. Facebook's chief, Mark Zuckerberg, wrote that the risks of allowing Mr Trump to post ""are simply too great"". Mr Zuckerberg said Facebook had removed the president's posts ""because we judged that their effect - and likely their intent - would be to provoke further violence"". Allow Facebook content?

He said it was clear Mr Trump intended to undermine the transfer of power to President-elect Joe Biden. ""Therefore, we are extending the block we have placed on his Facebook and Instagram accounts indefinitely and for at least the next two weeks until the peaceful transition of power is complete,"" he wrote. Mr Trump's favoured platform, Twitter, suspended the president for 12 hours on Wednesday. The company said it required the removal of three tweets for ""severe violations of our Civic Integrity policy"". It said the president's account would remain locked for good if the tweets were not removed. Twitter has now confirmed the offending tweets have been removed, and he is free to tweet again. LIVE: Biden victory confirmed after deadly attack on Capitol Trumpâs Twitter endgame What does a deadly day mean for Trump's legacy? Snapchat also stopped Mr Trump from creating new posts, but did not say if or when it would end the ban. YouTube also removed Wednesday's video. The president's supporters stormed the seat of US governmentand clashed with police, leading to the death of one woman. The violence brought to a halt congressional debate over Democrat Joe Biden's election win. In the House and Senate chambers, Republicans were challenging the certification of November's election results. This video can not be played ""We will never give up, we will never concede"", Trump tells supporters Before the violence, President Trump had told supporters on the National Mall in Washington that the election had been stolen.

"Hospitals are under increased pressure amid rising coronavirus cases Some hospitals in England are at risk of becoming Covid-only sites, with rising admissions for the virus forcing trusts to cut back on other services. There are now 26,500 Covid patients in hospital, meaning nearly a third of all people in hospital have the virus. In London, half of all patients being treated in hospital have Covid. It has prompted many hospitals to cancel routine operations to make more space - and there are now signs this is starting to happen for cancer care too. Doctors warned the impact on the NHS could be ""catastrophic"". It comes after a surge in patients in recent weeks. The number of Covid patients has risen by more than 50% since Christmas - and is forecast to continue doing so. There are now more than 3,000 new admissions a day on average, three times the normal winter rate for all respiratory conditions. This video can not be played WATCH: ICU hospital staff ""scared, sad, petrified, worried"" Chris Hopson of NHS Providers, which represents hospital managers, said the rising number of Covid cases was ""very worrying"" and had reached a ""critical point"", which was significantly affecting other services. He said that while the south east and east of England had borne the brunt of the rises, other parts of England were seeing rises too. In the last week alone there had been enough new Covid patients to fill 10 hospitals, he added. How busy are hospitals in England? Dr Nick Scriven, of the Society for Acute Medicine, said medical units, respiratory wards and elderly care wards had effectively become intensive-care areas with very sick patients being given oxygen therapy. He described the pressure on staff as ""intense"". Meanwhile, Prof Rupert Pearse, an intensive care consultant at the Royal London Hospital and member of the Intensive Care Society, said staffing levels in intensive care were being diluted to cope with one nurse to every three patients rather than the normal one-to-one. ""We are really very concerned now about the seriousness of the situation ... which is definitely worse than the first wave and proving much harder to deal with now as the resources we had in the first wave aren't available to us. ""So we're really struggling to provide the quality of patient care that we think patients deserve. And the impact of the pandemic is taking care away from other illnesses such as cancer and heart disease. ""In essence, the healthcare available to all of us is not as good as it should be right now."" Prof Pearse said that unless people took the lockdown seriously, the impact on healthcare across the country ""could be catastrophic"". The surge in cases has prompted increasing amount of non-Covid care to be stopped. This week, it emerged that potentially lifesaving cancer operations have been put on hold King's College Hospital in London because of the number of beds taken by Covid patients. This included all ""priority two"" operations - those doctors judge need to be carried out within 28 days. Prof Neil Mortensen, president of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, said he had heard from members that ""hospitals across London are having to cancel cancer surgeries as a result of the huge number of Covid-19 patients being hospitalised"".

"PM says he has ""no doubt"" there is enough supply to vaccinate the first four priority groups by 15 February NHS CEO Sir Simon Stevens says there will be a ""huge acceleration"" in the vaccination programme over the coming weeks Army logistics expert Brigadier Phil Prosser says his mission is to get vaccines ""in arms not on shelves"" A further 1,162 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is being rolled out to hundreds of GP-run vaccination centres in England Nearly 1.5 million people across the UK have now had their first dose, Boris Johnson says A weekly doorstep round of applause returns at 20:00 GMT - under the new name of Clap for Heroes For the first time, Sweden is recommending face masks on public transport during rush hours Japan announces a new state of emergency for Tokyo and surrounding areas as infections reach record levels Global virus cases have exceeded 87m and nearly 1.9m have died during the pandemic, according to figures tracked by Johns Hopkins University Edited by Marie Jackson That's all from the live page today, thank you for joining us. Today's updates were the work of Alice Evans, Joseph Lee, Lauren Turner, Emma Owen, Mary O'Connor, Richard Morris, George Wright and Jennifer Meierhans. This page was edited by James Clarke. We'll be back tomorrow to bring you all the very latest. We'll be pausing our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic in a few minutes' time. If you're just catching up, here are some of the latest developments: Following the release of the official daily figures on coronavirus cases, deaths and other statistics, here's a look at the coronavirus epidemic in the UK, through graphs and charts: Alison HoltSocial affairs correspondent Hospital managers in areas with high numbers of Covid cases
say they are talking to residential and nursing homes about taking
patients to ease pressures. So how will this work? In England, each area should now have designated places with
high levels of infection control to take Covid positive patients who no longer
need hospital care. These beds might be in a separate care home â so called
âhot homesâ- or in the wing of an existing home, which operates with different
staff from the rest of the building. Many care providers have been reluctant to
even consider such a role after the high number of care home deaths in the
first wave. One care homeowner, who is taking Covid patients, says he
has some empty beds but with the new variant of the virus spreading so easily,
he wants his staff vaccinated as a priority. In addition, concerns over whether
homes are insured if they take Covid patients still havenât been addressed. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has just led a Downing Street news conference,
alongside NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens and
Brigadier Phil Prosser. Hereâs a quick recap of the key points: Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Staff at St George's Hospital in Tooting, south-west London Strong words from NHS England chief executive Sir Simon
Stevens about conspiracy theories that hospitals are not busy. He calls it an
insult to staff. One figure that is often used is the fact that around one in 10 beds are available â that is actually more than last year. But that does not tell you the full story Hospitals have only been able to achieve this by
cancelling planned care â that includes routine treatments like hip and knee
operations but also, in some places, urgent cancer care. More intensive care beds have been opened â there are a
fifth more than there were at the start of November. But there is not a space or the specialist staff to run
these. So staff are being redeployed and wards turned into
emergency intensive care areas. One in three patients in UK hospitals now has Covid â in
some areas it is as high as one in two. This is stretching the health service to the limit. NHS England's chief executive Simon Stevens was earlier asked about concerns from NHS staff about people who falsely claim the virus is ""fake news"" and that hospitals are empty. In his response calling the claims an ""insult"" to NHS staff, Sir Simon also praised media reporting on the real pressures hospitals are facing, including the BBC's. The BBC's Medical editor, Fergus Walsh, hasreturned to an intensive care unit at University College Hospital, in central London. It was the same intensive care unit that he first visited in April, during the first peak of the pandemic. Shell-shocked staff have told of the physical and mental toll the pandemic is having on them. ""My emotions are all over the place. Scared, sad, petrified, worried,"" one ICU nurse said. This video can not be played ICU hospital staff: 'Scared, sad, petrified, worried' Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online These new life-saving Covid drugs,tocilizumab and sarilumab,may be hard to pronounce but they are easy to
give. And the NHS already has stocks of them, meaning the sickest patients can
receive doses immediately, to save hundreds more lives. This treatment
breakthrough couldn't come soon enough. There are more than 30,000 Covid
patients in hospitals around the UK - far more than during the peak of last
April. In trials, it has been found the new drugs cut deaths by a quarter,
saving around one extra life for every 12 people treated. They also speed up
recovery and reduce the length of time that critically-ill patients need to
spend in intensive care by about a week The next question comes from the Evening Standard's Sophia Sleigh. She says London's hospitals are ""staring into the abyss"" , and less than two weeks off being overwhelmed by the surge in the number of coronavirus patients. ""Why wasn't more done to stop us ending up here?"" she asks. Sir Simon answers by saying the UK's four chief medical officers acted to move the UK's risk level up to level five on Monday - which reflected the strain on the NHS. He adds that the London Nightingale field hospital expects to open to patients next week - and says it will also be used as a vaccination centre. In response to Sleigh's second question, about how and when life might return back to normal, the PM says ""there will be the chance to look at some relaxations of restrictions"" by 15 February. However, he says this will only be the case if the vaccination programme goes ahead with the speed expected, and no further new variants of the virus develop by then. Johnson says reopening schools will ""certainly be the priority"" in any review of lockdown rules. ""I do think things will be much better by the spring,"" he adds. That brings an end to today's press conference. Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent I was struck today by the language, tone and palpable anger from the prime minister and Sir Simon Stevens about the drivel that floats around on the internet about the pandemic. The prime minister said those who've turned up outside hospitals suggesting Coronavirus is a scam should ""grow up."" And Sir Simon, whose public manner is normally measured and reserved, is clearly furious at some of the stuff he has seen on social media. ""It's a lie"" he said pointedly at claims hospitals are actually quite quiet and ""most obviously untrue"". Instead, he said, people should rely on established media sources - as he name checked ITV, Sky News, Channel 4 and the BBC. Will James of Reuters asks Sir Simon if he can guarantee people who have had their first Pfizer jab will get their second. Sir Simon confirms they will get a second jab. He says the gap between vaccines also means it can be offered to many more people. James also asks the PM for the final toll that will be seen by spring. Boris Johnson says he cannot give that number - but that it will be ""tragically far too high"". ""Every death is a tragedy, we mourn every person we lose in this pandemic,"" he adds. The ""overall toll"" will depend on the success of the vaccination programme - and also on everyone working together to stop transmission of the virus and protect the NHS. Chris Smith of The Times asks if Covid and other patients will be able to receive a normal standard of care in the NHS. Secondly, he asks if the government will move to younger age groups to make sure 13 million people end up being vaccinated. Simon Stevens of the NHS says ""uptake is likely to be high"" of the Covid vaccine, following on from high numbers of people taking the flu jab this winter. He says ""people have heard that message"" on the vaccine and the NHS is getting a ""good response"" when people are being offered the vaccine. He adds that the situation in London is ""very serious"" following the new variant of Covid, saying NHS hospitals in London are receiving 800 Covid patients a day, which is the equivalent of St Thomas' Hospital. Hospitals are expanding critical care areas so these can be surged when demand is necessary, but he warns ""it is vital that the infection rate now comes under control"". Boris Johnson adds it is ""important"" that the government sets high ""stretching"" targets for vaccination, as the NHS is under ""extreme pressure already"" and high levels of vaccination is what the public wants, to avoid further lockdowns. Johnson says people who claim hospitals are empty 'need to grow up' Victoria Macdonald from Channel 4 asks the prime minister if he regrets not locking down earlier - given that many patients now in hospital will have been infected before Christmas. Boris Johnson says that the government learned of the new variant on 18 December and tier four measures were put in place the next day for the vast bulk of the country. Macdonald also asks about concern from NHS staff about people out there who falsely claim the virus is ""fake news"" and that hospitals are empty. Johnson replies these people ""need to grow up"", saying that we have already heard from Sir Simon how much pressure the NHS is under. We all need to do our bit to protect it, he says. For the vast majority, this means staying home to protect the NHS - and for those invited to take the vaccine, to have the jab. Sir Simon says that if people sneak into a hospital late at night and film an empty corridor, they are responsible for potentially changing behaviour that will kill people. It is an ""insult"" to the intensive care nurse, working 12 hour shifts in the most trying of circumstances, he adds. ""There is nothing more demoralising than having that kind of nonsense spouted when it is obviously untrue,"" says Sir Simon, praising reports on Channel 4, the BBC, ITV and Sky for reporting what is actually going on in hospitals. ITV's Emily Morgan asks the PM to clarify why some GPs have reported not receiving regular supplies of the coronavirus vaccine, despite having capacity to administer doses. The prime minister says ""to the best of my knowledge we are rolling out supplies of both vaccines to GP surgeries"", and repeats his earlier remark - that there will be roughly 1,000 primary care vaccination centres up and running across the country by the end of the week. He insists the supply of both vaccines is being rolled out but adds: ""I won't hide from you - of course, in the early phases, there's going to be lumpiness and bumpiness in the distribution. Today it may be that some GPs aren't getting the consignment that they expected."" Sir Simon adds that today is the first day of the vaccine rollout by GPs - and that with more than a thousand locations for the vaccine to be delivered to on a daily basis, there will be bumps along the road. ""We've just got to have a sense of gathering round to get this thing done as a big team effort, rather than poking and prodding [at small bumps in the road],"" he says. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Lots of detail has been given about how the NHS â working
hand-in-hand with the military â will be able to deliver the vaccines. There will be more local vaccination centres, hospital
hubs and even mass vaccination at sports stadiums. Thousands of extra vaccinators have already been trained
â and thousands more are waiting in the wings. But the biggest hurdle the UK faces is vaccine supply. If it is not available, it cannot be put in arms no
matter how many centres and vaccinators we have. In the long term supply is not going to be a problem â
two vaccines have already been approved and there are encouraging signs others
will follow. But in the short term everything depends on how quickly a
plant in Wrexham can get the vaccine produced by Astrazeneca into vials and
then how quickly the regulator can carry out the safety checks. At the moment there is thought to be only a few million
doses ready for the NHS â with another 15 million or so going through this
system. The target to vaccinate the most at risk groups by mid-February is achievable â but it will require a lot to go right. The BBC's Alex Forsyth asks if Donald Trump was responsible for inciting the storming of Congress in Washington DC. She also asks if the government can deliver in their promises on the vaccine. Boris Johnson says the US has stood for ""freedom"" and ""democracy"". He says what Mr Trump has done, casting doubt on the election result, was ""completely wrong"". He says he condemns anyone who would encourage people to behave the way they did in the Capitol. He says he is ""very pleased"" that democracy has prevailed and Joe Biden is the President-Elect. But he says the purpose of this press conference is to hear more detail on the vaccine roll-out. He adds that on Monday, there will be a further press conference with Matt Hancock giving specific details on the vaccination programme. Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent It is inevitable that part of the politics of a pandemic is the perceived relative performance of different countries. You can pick your metric to make your comparison, and plenty have. The death toll in the UK, and the economic slump, have come in for particular criticism. But the government has, for some time, sought to emphasise how the UK is ahead of the game on vaccinations. The UK was considerably quicker than the EU, for instance, in licencing the first vaccine, from Pfizer-BioNTech. At today's news conference, the Prime Minister has pointed out that the UK has already given more people a first jab for Covid than all the other countries in Europe put together. Sir Simon Stevens, the Chief Executive of the National Health Service in England, added that the UK has jabbed four times as many people as Germany and 300 times more than France. But he acknowledged the scale of the ongoing challenge - trying to vaccinate as many people in the next five weeks as normally happens in five months with the flu jab. One final thought: ministers tend to suggest international comparisons are pointless or premature when the comparisons are less than flattering. They're rather keener on them when the numbers look better. Stephen from Sheffield asks how the government is supporting students In his second question from the public, Johnson is asked how the government is supporting university students at this time. The PM says the government needs to ""look hard"" at the deal students have been given and ""what we can do to support students"" and help them at this very difficult time. Many cannot go back to university except for key practical courses, he notes. The PM says he understands the frustrations - and especially the ""financial frustrations that entails"". He tells the questioner, Stephen, from Sheffield that the issue is being looked at - and that he will be hearing more on this from the education secretary. After hearing from Brigadier Phil Prosser, the Downing Street coronavirus conference is now turning to questions from members of the public. Judith from Leeds asks how early years provision can safely remain open, if primary schools have been deemed a ""vector"" for spreading coronavirus. The PM says the ""whole point is that we believe that schools are safe"", as is, he says, early years provision - but ""we have to look at the overall budget of risk - the overall spread that schools can be involved in"". He adds that it is ""very important"" to keep early years education open to help key workers stay at work during the pandemic. NHS CEO Sir Simon Stevens adds that many health service staff rely on having available childcare - so keeping early years open is ""hugely important to the NHS's effort"" to tackle the virus. Brigadier Phil Prosser, Commander of Military Support to the Vaccine Delivery Programme, is now speaking. He says his team are drawing on their logistics knowledge from previous military operations to help roll out the vaccine. He says the ""mission"" in this case is to ""support the NHS"" and to ""minimise the number of deaths, as quickly and as safely as possible"". But, he warns, the plan has ""many challenges"". The Army has to make sure that vaccines are available across the UK, and in the case of the Pfizer vaccine, have to be stored at -70C. This means ""the plan needs to be agile,"" he adds. He says the Army plans to distribute the vaccine as soon as it receives each dose, adding ""it needs to be in arms, not on shelves"". Something on this scale ""has not been done before, and we are learning as we go"", he says, and the logistics operation is ""unparalleled in its scale and complexity"". It is the equivalent, he says, of setting up a major supermarket chain in less than a month. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Shijiazhuang authorities have started mass-testing residents following an outbreak in the city China has placed 11 million people in the northern city of Shijiazhuang under lockdown after more than 100 new Covid cases were confirmed there. Residents are banned from leaving the city and schools have also been closed. More than 5,000 testing sites have been set up so every resident can be tested. The new figures are the highest China has seen in more than five months. The country has been able to contain such outbreaks by immediately taking tough action. This has involved consistently using mass testing when new clusters of cases appear, even if they seem relatively small. Hebei province, where Shijiazhuang is located, reported 120 new cases on Thursday and all but one of those infections was in the city.Â Elsewhere in the country, 22 new cases were confirmed.Â The virus was first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019 before spiralling into a global pandemic. Thursday's lockdown comes just weeks ahead of Chinese New Year, a time when people in China travel en masse to spend the holiday with their families. How Wuhan went from quiet streets to packed pools Did China test a whole city in 10 days? But residents in the Gaocheng district of Shijiazhuang, considered to be the epicentre of the outbreak, are now not allowed to leave their local area. Other residents are banned from leaving the city. In terms of transport, bus travel has been halted and many flights have been cancelled. Residents have been banned from leaving the city In a sign of just how seriously the authorities see the situation, even the postal service in and out of Shijiazhuang has been suspended for three days. And the restrictions are being tightly enforced - police were photographed in protective hazmat suits guarding the entrance to an expressway. Three officials in Shijiazhuang's Gaocheng districthave been punished for ""negligence"",,externalaccording to the state-run China Daily newspaper. ""Villages should identify, report, isolate and treat cases as early as possible, so as to cut off the transmission,"" Wu Hao, a national health official, was quoted as saying. Five hospitals in Shijiazhuang have been cleared for Covid-19 patients, with three others standing by, the city's Vice-Mayor Meng Xianghong said. Thursday's lockdown comes just weeks ahead of Chinese New Year - a time when families gather It is not the first time China has locked down a city in response to a cluster of cases since the outbreak in Wuhan. In October, all nine million residents of the Chinese city of Qingdaowere tested in five days after a dozen cases were confirmed. The cases were linked to a hospital treating coronavirus patients arriving from abroad. The same month, authorities in Kashgar, in Xinjiang,tested around 4.7m people after an outbreak there.

Today's updates were the work of Alice Evans, Joseph Lee, Lauren Turner, Emma Owen, Mary O'Connor, Richard Morris, George Wright and Jennifer Meierhans. This page was edited by James Clarke. We'll be back tomorrow to bring you all the very latest. We'll be pausing our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic in a few minutes' time. If you're just catching up, here are some of the latest developments: Following the release of the official daily figures on coronavirus cases, deaths and other statistics, here's a look at the coronavirus epidemic in the UK, through graphs and charts: Alison HoltSocial affairs correspondent Hospital managers in areas with high numbers of Covid cases
say they are talking to residential and nursing homes about taking
patients to ease pressures. So how will this work? In England, each area should now have designated places with
high levels of infection control to take Covid positive patients who no longer
need hospital care. These beds might be in a separate care home â so called
âhot homesâ- or in the wing of an existing home, which operates with different
staff from the rest of the building. Many care providers have been reluctant to
even consider such a role after the high number of care home deaths in the
first wave. One care homeowner, who is taking Covid patients, says he
has some empty beds but with the new variant of the virus spreading so easily,
he wants his staff vaccinated as a priority. In addition, concerns over whether
homes are insured if they take Covid patients still havenât been addressed. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has just led a Downing Street news conference,
alongside NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens and
Brigadier Phil Prosser. Hereâs a quick recap of the key points: Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Staff at St George's Hospital in Tooting, south-west London Strong words from NHS England chief executive Sir Simon
Stevens about conspiracy theories that hospitals are not busy. He calls it an
insult to staff. One figure that is often used is the fact that around one in 10 beds are available â that is actually more than last year. But that does not tell you the full story Hospitals have only been able to achieve this by
cancelling planned care â that includes routine treatments like hip and knee
operations but also, in some places, urgent cancer care. More intensive care beds have been opened â there are a
fifth more than there were at the start of November. But there is not a space or the specialist staff to run
these. So staff are being redeployed and wards turned into
emergency intensive care areas. One in three patients in UK hospitals now has Covid â in
some areas it is as high as one in two. This is stretching the health service to the limit. NHS England's chief executive Simon Stevens was earlier asked about concerns from NHS staff about people who falsely claim the virus is ""fake news"" and that hospitals are empty. In his response calling the claims an ""insult"" to NHS staff, Sir Simon also praised media reporting on the real pressures hospitals are facing, including the BBC's. The BBC's Medical editor, Fergus Walsh, hasreturned to an intensive care unit at University College Hospital, in central London. It was the same intensive care unit that he first visited in April, during the first peak of the pandemic. Shell-shocked staff have told of the physical and mental toll the pandemic is having on them. ""My emotions are all over the place. Scared, sad, petrified, worried,"" one ICU nurse said. This video can not be played ICU hospital staff: 'Scared, sad, petrified, worried' Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online These new life-saving Covid drugs,tocilizumab and sarilumab,may be hard to pronounce but they are easy to
give. And the NHS already has stocks of them, meaning the sickest patients can
receive doses immediately, to save hundreds more lives. This treatment
breakthrough couldn't come soon enough. There are more than 30,000 Covid
patients in hospitals around the UK - far more than during the peak of last
April. In trials, it has been found the new drugs cut deaths by a quarter,
saving around one extra life for every 12 people treated. They also speed up
recovery and reduce the length of time that critically-ill patients need to
spend in intensive care by about a week The next question comes from the Evening Standard's Sophia Sleigh. She says London's hospitals are ""staring into the abyss"" , and less than two weeks off being overwhelmed by the surge in the number of coronavirus patients. ""Why wasn't more done to stop us ending up here?"" she asks. Sir Simon answers by saying the UK's four chief medical officers acted to move the UK's risk level up to level five on Monday - which reflected the strain on the NHS. He adds that the London Nightingale field hospital expects to open to patients next week - and says it will also be used as a vaccination centre. In response to Sleigh's second question, about how and when life might return back to normal, the PM says ""there will be the chance to look at some relaxations of restrictions"" by 15 February. However, he says this will only be the case if the vaccination programme goes ahead with the speed expected, and no further new variants of the virus develop by then. Johnson says reopening schools will ""certainly be the priority"" in any review of lockdown rules. ""I do think things will be much better by the spring,"" he adds. That brings an end to today's press conference. Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent I was struck today by the language, tone and palpable anger from the prime minister and Sir Simon Stevens about the drivel that floats around on the internet about the pandemic. The prime minister said those who've turned up outside hospitals suggesting Coronavirus is a scam should ""grow up."" And Sir Simon, whose public manner is normally measured and reserved, is clearly furious at some of the stuff he has seen on social media. ""It's a lie"" he said pointedly at claims hospitals are actually quite quiet and ""most obviously untrue"". Instead, he said, people should rely on established media sources - as he name checked ITV, Sky News, Channel 4 and the BBC. Will James of Reuters asks Sir Simon if he can guarantee people who have had their first Pfizer jab will get their second. Sir Simon confirms they will get a second jab. He says the gap between vaccines also means it can be offered to many more people. James also asks the PM for the final toll that will be seen by spring. Boris Johnson says he cannot give that number - but that it will be ""tragically far too high"". ""Every death is a tragedy, we mourn every person we lose in this pandemic,"" he adds. The ""overall toll"" will depend on the success of the vaccination programme - and also on everyone working together to stop transmission of the virus and protect the NHS. Chris Smith of The Times asks if Covid and other patients will be able to receive a normal standard of care in the NHS. Secondly, he asks if the government will move to younger age groups to make sure 13 million people end up being vaccinated. Simon Stevens of the NHS says ""uptake is likely to be high"" of the Covid vaccine, following on from high numbers of people taking the flu jab this winter. He says ""people have heard that message"" on the vaccine and the NHS is getting a ""good response"" when people are being offered the vaccine. He adds that the situation in London is ""very serious"" following the new variant of Covid, saying NHS hospitals in London are receiving 800 Covid patients a day, which is the equivalent of St Thomas' Hospital. Hospitals are expanding critical care areas so these can be surged when demand is necessary, but he warns ""it is vital that the infection rate now comes under control"". Boris Johnson adds it is ""important"" that the government sets high ""stretching"" targets for vaccination, as the NHS is under ""extreme pressure already"" and high levels of vaccination is what the public wants, to avoid further lockdowns. Johnson says people who claim hospitals are empty 'need to grow up' Victoria Macdonald from Channel 4 asks the prime minister if he regrets not locking down earlier - given that many patients now in hospital will have been infected before Christmas. Boris Johnson says that the government learned of the new variant on 18 December and tier four measures were put in place the next day for the vast bulk of the country. Macdonald also asks about concern from NHS staff about people out there who falsely claim the virus is ""fake news"" and that hospitals are empty. Johnson replies these people ""need to grow up"", saying that we have already heard from Sir Simon how much pressure the NHS is under. We all need to do our bit to protect it, he says. For the vast majority, this means staying home to protect the NHS - and for those invited to take the vaccine, to have the jab. Sir Simon says that if people sneak into a hospital late at night and film an empty corridor, they are responsible for potentially changing behaviour that will kill people. It is an ""insult"" to the intensive care nurse, working 12 hour shifts in the most trying of circumstances, he adds. ""There is nothing more demoralising than having that kind of nonsense spouted when it is obviously untrue,"" says Sir Simon, praising reports on Channel 4, the BBC, ITV and Sky for reporting what is actually going on in hospitals. ITV's Emily Morgan asks the PM to clarify why some GPs have reported not receiving regular supplies of the coronavirus vaccine, despite having capacity to administer doses. The prime minister says ""to the best of my knowledge we are rolling out supplies of both vaccines to GP surgeries"", and repeats his earlier remark - that there will be roughly 1,000 primary care vaccination centres up and running across the country by the end of the week. He insists the supply of both vaccines is being rolled out but adds: ""I won't hide from you - of course, in the early phases, there's going to be lumpiness and bumpiness in the distribution. Today it may be that some GPs aren't getting the consignment that they expected."" Sir Simon adds that today is the first day of the vaccine rollout by GPs - and that with more than a thousand locations for the vaccine to be delivered to on a daily basis, there will be bumps along the road. ""We've just got to have a sense of gathering round to get this thing done as a big team effort, rather than poking and prodding [at small bumps in the road],"" he says. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Lots of detail has been given about how the NHS â working
hand-in-hand with the military â will be able to deliver the vaccines. There will be more local vaccination centres, hospital
hubs and even mass vaccination at sports stadiums. Thousands of extra vaccinators have already been trained
â and thousands more are waiting in the wings. But the biggest hurdle the UK faces is vaccine supply. If it is not available, it cannot be put in arms no
matter how many centres and vaccinators we have. In the long term supply is not going to be a problem â
two vaccines have already been approved and there are encouraging signs others
will follow. But in the short term everything depends on how quickly a
plant in Wrexham can get the vaccine produced by Astrazeneca into vials and
then how quickly the regulator can carry out the safety checks. At the moment there is thought to be only a few million
doses ready for the NHS â with another 15 million or so going through this
system. The target to vaccinate the most at risk groups by mid-February is achievable â but it will require a lot to go right. The BBC's Alex Forsyth asks if Donald Trump was responsible for inciting the storming of Congress in Washington DC. She also asks if the government can deliver in their promises on the vaccine. Boris Johnson says the US has stood for ""freedom"" and ""democracy"". He says what Mr Trump has done, casting doubt on the election result, was ""completely wrong"". He says he condemns anyone who would encourage people to behave the way they did in the Capitol. He says he is ""very pleased"" that democracy has prevailed and Joe Biden is the President-Elect. But he says the purpose of this press conference is to hear more detail on the vaccine roll-out. He adds that on Monday, there will be a further press conference with Matt Hancock giving specific details on the vaccination programme. Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent It is inevitable that part of the politics of a pandemic is the perceived relative performance of different countries. You can pick your metric to make your comparison, and plenty have. The death toll in the UK, and the economic slump, have come in for particular criticism. But the government has, for some time, sought to emphasise how the UK is ahead of the game on vaccinations. The UK was considerably quicker than the EU, for instance, in licencing the first vaccine, from Pfizer-BioNTech. At today's news conference, the Prime Minister has pointed out that the UK has already given more people a first jab for Covid than all the other countries in Europe put together. Sir Simon Stevens, the Chief Executive of the National Health Service in England, added that the UK has jabbed four times as many people as Germany and 300 times more than France. But he acknowledged the scale of the ongoing challenge - trying to vaccinate as many people in the next five weeks as normally happens in five months with the flu jab. One final thought: ministers tend to suggest international comparisons are pointless or premature when the comparisons are less than flattering. They're rather keener on them when the numbers look better. Stephen from Sheffield asks how the government is supporting students In his second question from the public, Johnson is asked how the government is supporting university students at this time. The PM says the government needs to ""look hard"" at the deal students have been given and ""what we can do to support students"" and help them at this very difficult time. Many cannot go back to university except for key practical courses, he notes. The PM says he understands the frustrations - and especially the ""financial frustrations that entails"". He tells the questioner, Stephen, from Sheffield that the issue is being looked at - and that he will be hearing more on this from the education secretary. After hearing from Brigadier Phil Prosser, the Downing Street coronavirus conference is now turning to questions from members of the public. Judith from Leeds asks how early years provision can safely remain open, if primary schools have been deemed a ""vector"" for spreading coronavirus. The PM says the ""whole point is that we believe that schools are safe"", as is, he says, early years provision - but ""we have to look at the overall budget of risk - the overall spread that schools can be involved in"". He adds that it is ""very important"" to keep early years education open to help key workers stay at work during the pandemic. NHS CEO Sir Simon Stevens adds that many health service staff rely on having available childcare - so keeping early years open is ""hugely important to the NHS's effort"" to tackle the virus. Brigadier Phil Prosser, Commander of Military Support to the Vaccine Delivery Programme, is now speaking. He says his team are drawing on their logistics knowledge from previous military operations to help roll out the vaccine. He says the ""mission"" in this case is to ""support the NHS"" and to ""minimise the number of deaths, as quickly and as safely as possible"". But, he warns, the plan has ""many challenges"". The Army has to make sure that vaccines are available across the UK, and in the case of the Pfizer vaccine, have to be stored at -70C. This means ""the plan needs to be agile,"" he adds. He says the Army plans to distribute the vaccine as soon as it receives each dose, adding ""it needs to be in arms, not on shelves"". Something on this scale ""has not been done before, and we are learning as we go"", he says, and the logistics operation is ""unparalleled in its scale and complexity"". It is the equivalent, he says, of setting up a major supermarket chain in less than a month. Â© 2025 BBC.

Brigadier Phil Prosser, Commander of Military Support to the Vaccine Delivery Programme, is now speaking. He says his team are drawing on their logistics knowledge from previous military operations to help roll out the vaccine. He says the ""mission"" in this case is to ""support the NHS"" and to ""minimise the number of deaths, as quickly and as safely as possible"". But, he warns, the plan has ""many challenges"". The Army has to make sure that vaccines are available across the UK, and in the case of the Pfizer vaccine, have to be stored at -70C. This means ""the plan needs to be agile,"" he adds. He says the Army plans to distribute the vaccine as soon as it receives each dose, adding ""it needs to be in arms, not on shelves"". Something on this scale ""has not been done before, and we are learning as we go"", he says, and the logistics operation is ""unparalleled in its scale and complexity"". It is the equivalent, he says, of setting up a major supermarket chain in less than a month. Â© 2025 BBC.

Today's updates were the work of Alice Evans, Joseph Lee, Lauren Turner, Emma Owen, Mary O'Connor, Richard Morris, George Wright and Jennifer Meierhans. This page was edited by James Clarke. We'll be back tomorrow to bring you all the very latest. We'll be pausing our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic in a few minutes' time. If you're just catching up, here are some of the latest developments: Following the release of the official daily figures on coronavirus cases, deaths and other statistics, here's a look at the coronavirus epidemic in the UK, through graphs and charts: Alison HoltSocial affairs correspondent Hospital managers in areas with high numbers of Covid cases
say they are talking to residential and nursing homes about taking
patients to ease pressures. So how will this work? In England, each area should now have designated places with
high levels of infection control to take Covid positive patients who no longer
need hospital care. These beds might be in a separate care home â so called
âhot homesâ- or in the wing of an existing home, which operates with different
staff from the rest of the building. Many care providers have been reluctant to
even consider such a role after the high number of care home deaths in the
first wave. One care homeowner, who is taking Covid patients, says he
has some empty beds but with the new variant of the virus spreading so easily,
he wants his staff vaccinated as a priority. In addition, concerns over whether
homes are insured if they take Covid patients still havenât been addressed. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has just led a Downing Street news conference,
alongside NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens and
Brigadier Phil Prosser. Hereâs a quick recap of the key points: Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Staff at St George's Hospital in Tooting, south-west London Strong words from NHS England chief executive Sir Simon
Stevens about conspiracy theories that hospitals are not busy. He calls it an
insult to staff. One figure that is often used is the fact that around one in 10 beds are available â that is actually more than last year. But that does not tell you the full story Hospitals have only been able to achieve this by
cancelling planned care â that includes routine treatments like hip and knee
operations but also, in some places, urgent cancer care. More intensive care beds have been opened â there are a
fifth more than there were at the start of November. But there is not a space or the specialist staff to run
these. So staff are being redeployed and wards turned into
emergency intensive care areas. One in three patients in UK hospitals now has Covid â in
some areas it is as high as one in two. This is stretching the health service to the limit. NHS England's chief executive Simon Stevens was earlier asked about concerns from NHS staff about people who falsely claim the virus is ""fake news"" and that hospitals are empty. In his response calling the claims an ""insult"" to NHS staff, Sir Simon also praised media reporting on the real pressures hospitals are facing, including the BBC's. The BBC's Medical editor, Fergus Walsh, hasreturned to an intensive care unit at University College Hospital, in central London. It was the same intensive care unit that he first visited in April, during the first peak of the pandemic. Shell-shocked staff have told of the physical and mental toll the pandemic is having on them. ""My emotions are all over the place. Scared, sad, petrified, worried,"" one ICU nurse said. This video can not be played ICU hospital staff: 'Scared, sad, petrified, worried' Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online These new life-saving Covid drugs,tocilizumab and sarilumab,may be hard to pronounce but they are easy to
give. And the NHS already has stocks of them, meaning the sickest patients can
receive doses immediately, to save hundreds more lives. This treatment
breakthrough couldn't come soon enough. There are more than 30,000 Covid
patients in hospitals around the UK - far more than during the peak of last
April. In trials, it has been found the new drugs cut deaths by a quarter,
saving around one extra life for every 12 people treated. They also speed up
recovery and reduce the length of time that critically-ill patients need to
spend in intensive care by about a week The next question comes from the Evening Standard's Sophia Sleigh. She says London's hospitals are ""staring into the abyss"" , and less than two weeks off being overwhelmed by the surge in the number of coronavirus patients. ""Why wasn't more done to stop us ending up here?"" she asks. Sir Simon answers by saying the UK's four chief medical officers acted to move the UK's risk level up to level five on Monday - which reflected the strain on the NHS. He adds that the London Nightingale field hospital expects to open to patients next week - and says it will also be used as a vaccination centre. In response to Sleigh's second question, about how and when life might return back to normal, the PM says ""there will be the chance to look at some relaxations of restrictions"" by 15 February. However, he says this will only be the case if the vaccination programme goes ahead with the speed expected, and no further new variants of the virus develop by then. Johnson says reopening schools will ""certainly be the priority"" in any review of lockdown rules. ""I do think things will be much better by the spring,"" he adds. That brings an end to today's press conference. Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent I was struck today by the language, tone and palpable anger from the prime minister and Sir Simon Stevens about the drivel that floats around on the internet about the pandemic. The prime minister said those who've turned up outside hospitals suggesting Coronavirus is a scam should ""grow up."" And Sir Simon, whose public manner is normally measured and reserved, is clearly furious at some of the stuff he has seen on social media. ""It's a lie"" he said pointedly at claims hospitals are actually quite quiet and ""most obviously untrue"". Instead, he said, people should rely on established media sources - as he name checked ITV, Sky News, Channel 4 and the BBC. Will James of Reuters asks Sir Simon if he can guarantee people who have had their first Pfizer jab will get their second. Sir Simon confirms they will get a second jab. He says the gap between vaccines also means it can be offered to many more people. James also asks the PM for the final toll that will be seen by spring. Boris Johnson says he cannot give that number - but that it will be ""tragically far too high"". ""Every death is a tragedy, we mourn every person we lose in this pandemic,"" he adds. The ""overall toll"" will depend on the success of the vaccination programme - and also on everyone working together to stop transmission of the virus and protect the NHS. Chris Smith of The Times asks if Covid and other patients will be able to receive a normal standard of care in the NHS. Secondly, he asks if the government will move to younger age groups to make sure 13 million people end up being vaccinated. Simon Stevens of the NHS says ""uptake is likely to be high"" of the Covid vaccine, following on from high numbers of people taking the flu jab this winter. He says ""people have heard that message"" on the vaccine and the NHS is getting a ""good response"" when people are being offered the vaccine. He adds that the situation in London is ""very serious"" following the new variant of Covid, saying NHS hospitals in London are receiving 800 Covid patients a day, which is the equivalent of St Thomas' Hospital. Hospitals are expanding critical care areas so these can be surged when demand is necessary, but he warns ""it is vital that the infection rate now comes under control"". Boris Johnson adds it is ""important"" that the government sets high ""stretching"" targets for vaccination, as the NHS is under ""extreme pressure already"" and high levels of vaccination is what the public wants, to avoid further lockdowns. Johnson says people who claim hospitals are empty 'need to grow up' Victoria Macdonald from Channel 4 asks the prime minister if he regrets not locking down earlier - given that many patients now in hospital will have been infected before Christmas. Boris Johnson says that the government learned of the new variant on 18 December and tier four measures were put in place the next day for the vast bulk of the country. Macdonald also asks about concern from NHS staff about people out there who falsely claim the virus is ""fake news"" and that hospitals are empty. Johnson replies these people ""need to grow up"", saying that we have already heard from Sir Simon how much pressure the NHS is under. We all need to do our bit to protect it, he says. For the vast majority, this means staying home to protect the NHS - and for those invited to take the vaccine, to have the jab. Sir Simon says that if people sneak into a hospital late at night and film an empty corridor, they are responsible for potentially changing behaviour that will kill people. It is an ""insult"" to the intensive care nurse, working 12 hour shifts in the most trying of circumstances, he adds. ""There is nothing more demoralising than having that kind of nonsense spouted when it is obviously untrue,"" says Sir Simon, praising reports on Channel 4, the BBC, ITV and Sky for reporting what is actually going on in hospitals. ITV's Emily Morgan asks the PM to clarify why some GPs have reported not receiving regular supplies of the coronavirus vaccine, despite having capacity to administer doses. The prime minister says ""to the best of my knowledge we are rolling out supplies of both vaccines to GP surgeries"", and repeats his earlier remark - that there will be roughly 1,000 primary care vaccination centres up and running across the country by the end of the week. He insists the supply of both vaccines is being rolled out but adds: ""I won't hide from you - of course, in the early phases, there's going to be lumpiness and bumpiness in the distribution. Today it may be that some GPs aren't getting the consignment that they expected."" Sir Simon adds that today is the first day of the vaccine rollout by GPs - and that with more than a thousand locations for the vaccine to be delivered to on a daily basis, there will be bumps along the road. ""We've just got to have a sense of gathering round to get this thing done as a big team effort, rather than poking and prodding [at small bumps in the road],"" he says. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Lots of detail has been given about how the NHS â working
hand-in-hand with the military â will be able to deliver the vaccines. There will be more local vaccination centres, hospital
hubs and even mass vaccination at sports stadiums. Thousands of extra vaccinators have already been trained
â and thousands more are waiting in the wings. But the biggest hurdle the UK faces is vaccine supply. If it is not available, it cannot be put in arms no
matter how many centres and vaccinators we have. In the long term supply is not going to be a problem â
two vaccines have already been approved and there are encouraging signs others
will follow. But in the short term everything depends on how quickly a
plant in Wrexham can get the vaccine produced by Astrazeneca into vials and
then how quickly the regulator can carry out the safety checks. At the moment there is thought to be only a few million
doses ready for the NHS â with another 15 million or so going through this
system. The target to vaccinate the most at risk groups by mid-February is achievable â but it will require a lot to go right. The BBC's Alex Forsyth asks if Donald Trump was responsible for inciting the storming of Congress in Washington DC. She also asks if the government can deliver in their promises on the vaccine. Boris Johnson says the US has stood for ""freedom"" and ""democracy"". He says what Mr Trump has done, casting doubt on the election result, was ""completely wrong"". He says he condemns anyone who would encourage people to behave the way they did in the Capitol. He says he is ""very pleased"" that democracy has prevailed and Joe Biden is the President-Elect. But he says the purpose of this press conference is to hear more detail on the vaccine roll-out. He adds that on Monday, there will be a further press conference with Matt Hancock giving specific details on the vaccination programme. Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent It is inevitable that part of the politics of a pandemic is the perceived relative performance of different countries. You can pick your metric to make your comparison, and plenty have. The death toll in the UK, and the economic slump, have come in for particular criticism. But the government has, for some time, sought to emphasise how the UK is ahead of the game on vaccinations. The UK was considerably quicker than the EU, for instance, in licencing the first vaccine, from Pfizer-BioNTech. At today's news conference, the Prime Minister has pointed out that the UK has already given more people a first jab for Covid than all the other countries in Europe put together. Sir Simon Stevens, the Chief Executive of the National Health Service in England, added that the UK has jabbed four times as many people as Germany and 300 times more than France. But he acknowledged the scale of the ongoing challenge - trying to vaccinate as many people in the next five weeks as normally happens in five months with the flu jab. One final thought: ministers tend to suggest international comparisons are pointless or premature when the comparisons are less than flattering. They're rather keener on them when the numbers look better. Stephen from Sheffield asks how the government is supporting students In his second question from the public, Johnson is asked how the government is supporting university students at this time. The PM says the government needs to ""look hard"" at the deal students have been given and ""what we can do to support students"" and help them at this very difficult time. Many cannot go back to university except for key practical courses, he notes. The PM says he understands the frustrations - and especially the ""financial frustrations that entails"". He tells the questioner, Stephen, from Sheffield that the issue is being looked at - and that he will be hearing more on this from the education secretary. After hearing from Brigadier Phil Prosser, the Downing Street coronavirus conference is now turning to questions from members of the public. Judith from Leeds asks how early years provision can safely remain open, if primary schools have been deemed a ""vector"" for spreading coronavirus. The PM says the ""whole point is that we believe that schools are safe"", as is, he says, early years provision - but ""we have to look at the overall budget of risk - the overall spread that schools can be involved in"". He adds that it is ""very important"" to keep early years education open to help key workers stay at work during the pandemic. NHS CEO Sir Simon Stevens adds that many health service staff rely on having available childcare - so keeping early years open is ""hugely important to the NHS's effort"" to tackle the virus. Brigadier Phil Prosser, Commander of Military Support to the Vaccine Delivery Programme, is now speaking. He says his team are drawing on their logistics knowledge from previous military operations to help roll out the vaccine. He says the ""mission"" in this case is to ""support the NHS"" and to ""minimise the number of deaths, as quickly and as safely as possible"". But, he warns, the plan has ""many challenges"".

"This video can not be played When a mob stormed the US capitol US President Donald Trump's opponents in the two houses of Congress have called for him to be removed from office after the violent invasion of the Capitol by a mob of his supporters. Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer said Mr Trump should be removed immediately. If he is not, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says he could be impeached. Removal would need Republican support and only a few have so far backed it. In a video speech, Mr Trump said he was committed to an ""orderly"" transition. The president said a new administration would be inaugurated on 20 January, and called for ""healing and reconciliation"". He also said he was ""outraged by the violence, lawlessness and mayhem"" on Wednesday and that ""tempers must be cooled and calm restored"". The video was shared on his Twitter account, which was reactivated on Thursday after being suspended following the Capitol riot. At least four people died during the unrest, and 68 have now been arrested. The actions of the police have come under scrutiny, with officers facing criticism for failing to stop the rioters breaking in. The official responsible for security in the House of Representatives, the sergeant at arms, has resigned. Reports say US Capitol Police (USCP) chief Steven Sund is also resigning, effective 16 January, following calls from Ms Pelosi. Mr Schumer has called for his counterpart in the Senate to be sacked. Transport Secretary Elaine Chao is the latest member of the Trump administration to quit in protest over the riots. Several lower-level officials have also resigned. Questions mount over security failure The US Air Force veteran who lost her life in riots Johnson condemns Trump over US Capitol siege President-elect Joe Biden said: ""Nobody could tell me that if it was a group of Black Lives Matter protesters yesterday they wouldn't have been treated very differently than the thugs that stormed the Capitol."" This video can not be played Joe Biden: Black Lives Matter protesters would have been treated ""differently"" A growing number have called for Mr Trump to be removed as president. Most of them are from Mr Biden's Democratic Party but a few Republicans have joined in. ""This president should not hold office one day longer,"" said Mr Schumer, who will lead the Democratic majority in the Senate when it begins its new session later this month. What does a deadly day mean for Trump's legacy? 'They tried to break in - then I heard a shot' Who broke into the building? He urged Mr Trump's cabinet to remove him from office using the 25th Amendment to the US Constitution, which allows the vice-president to step up if the president is unable to perform his duties owing to a mental or physical illness. It would require Vice-President Mike Pence and at least eight cabinet members to break with Mr Trump and invoke the amendment - something they have so far seemed unlikely to do. Ms Pelosi described Mr Trump as ""a very dangerous person"" and said: ""This is an emergency of the highest magnitude."" She left open the option of impeachment if Mr Trump's colleagues did not start 25th Amendment proceedings. However, the Democrats would need to rely on the support of Republicans to secure the necessary two-thirds majority in the Senate to convict Mr Trump under the articles of impeachment in the constitution, and would be unlikely to get those numbers. A visual guide to the storming of Congress Congressman Adam Kinzinger from Illinois was one of the first Republicans to call for use of the 25th Amendment, saying: ""Fires stoked by the president finally leapt out of the pan."" This video can not be played Phone footage reveals chaotic scenes inside US Capitol The Republican governors of Maryland and Vermont have also called for Mr Trump to be removed from office. Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee have said that Mr Trump's actions meet the amendment's requirements. Separately, both the House and the Senate have adjourned until after Mr Biden is sworn in on 20 January. Both houses would have to be recalled in order to start impeachment proceedings. In pictures: Pro-Trump protesters storm Capitol Facebook blocks Trump 'until transition complete' Several Trump administration officials have now resigned over the riots - Elaine Chao is the most high-profile. Ms Chao, who has served through the whole presidency and is married to the top Senate Republican, Mitch McConnell, said the events had ""deeply troubled me in a way that I simply cannot set aside"". Others to quit include special envoy Mick Mulvaney, a senior national security official, and the chief of staff to First Lady Melania Trump. A State Department adviser was also sacked after calling Mr Trump ""unfit for office"" in a tweet. The president is also facing new restrictions on his use of social media. Facebook, which owns Instagram, has suspended him from both platforms at least until he leaves office and possibly indefinitely. Twitter suspended his account for 12 hours. The 25th Amendment, enacted in 1967, was designed to provide a more detailed process for the succession of presidential power. The writers envisioned national catastrophes or a medically incapacitated president as situations the amendment could address. It was not contemplated, at least initially, as a means to drag a president who is viewed as a threat to the nation from office. That, however, is exactly what many Democrats - including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi - are suggesting should happen to Donald Trump. It's what one current Republican congressman, Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, is calling for and what one of Trump's former White House chiefs of staff, John Kelly, said he supported. With just 13 days left in the Trump presidency, the unprecedented step of stripping an unwilling president of power, which requires the consent of the vice-president and a majority of the 15-member presidential cabinet, seems unlikely. But the report that such steps are being contemplated underline the gravity of the current situation. Democrats are also once again talking about impeachment and conviction by the Senate, a process that would take more time but would, as an additional benefit in their minds, prohibit Mr Trump from running for office in the future. Police have been heavily criticised for their response to the violence. Images captured inside the Capitol building showed rioters strolling through some of the corridors unimpeded. One man occupied Ms Pelosi's office, putting his feet up on her desk, while another was photographed walking out carrying a lectern. Police stand guard during the curfew overnight on Wednesday Washington police say 68 people have so far been arrested, only one of them from the DC area. One USCP officer has been placed on leave after a woman was shot dead on the floor of the House of Representatives. The woman, who has been named as air force veteran Ashli Babbitt, 35, was part of a group that forced its way into the chamber while it was still in session. Police said three other people - 50-year-old Benjamin Philips from Pennsylvania; 55-year-old Kevin Greeson from Alabama; and 34-year-old Rosanne Boyland from Georgia - died of unspecified ""medical emergencies"". Mr Greeson's family said he died of a heart attack. The FBI is seeking to identify those involved in the rampage. The Department of Justice says those arrested could face charges of seditious conspiracy, as well as rioting and insurrection. One of those detained at the Capitol had a ""military-style automatic weapon and 11 Molotov cocktails (petrol bombs)"", according to the federal attorney for Washington DC. On Thursday, crews began installing a non-scalable 7ft (2m) fence around the Capitol. It will remain in place for at least 30 days. Michelle Obama, wife of Mr Trump's presidential predecessor, Barack Obama, released a statement calling attention to the racial disparity in the way different protests were policed. She described Mr Trump as ""an infantile and unpatriotic president"", and said it would be impossible to move on until there was a reckoning with Wednesday's events. ""Yesterday made it painfully clear that certain Americans are, in fact, allowed to denigrate the flag and symbols of our nation. They've just got to look the right way,"" she wrote. This video can not be played 'Treason, traitors and thugs'  - the words lawmakers used to describe Capitol riot The New York Times reported, quoting unnamed sources, that Mr Trump was considering granting a pardon to himself in the final days of his presidency.

"This video can not be played When a mob stormed the US capitol The US Congress has certified Joe Biden's victory in the presidential election, hours after supporters of Donald Trump stormed the building in an attack that saw four people die. Lawmakers resumed the session after police removed a mob that had been encouraged by President Trump as part of his attempt to overturn his defeat. The certification clears the way for Mr Biden to be sworn in on 20 January. In response, Mr Trump finally pledged an ""orderly transition"" of power. Follow our live updates here Wednesday's chaotic scenes followed months of escalating rhetoric from Mr Trump and some Republican allies that sought to undermine the result of the 3 November election. The invasion of the Capitol by the president's supporters - some armed - was an event without precedent in modern American history. Washington DC Mayor Muriel Bowser said one of the four who died - a woman named as Ashli Babbitt - was part of a group that forced entry into the chamber of the House of Representatives while it was still in session. They were confronted by plainclothes officers, and an officer pulled out a weapon and fired it. What does a deadly day mean for Trump's legacy? In pictures: Pro-Trump protesters storm Capitol 'They tried to break in - then I heard a shot' The US Capitol Police said the employee involved had been put on administrative leave pending an investigation. This video can not be played The US Congress has formally confirmed Joe Biden's victory Local media said Ashli Babbitt was a San Diego-area US Air Force veteran and Trump supporter. She was proclaimed dead at hospital. One woman and two men died as a result of ""medical emergencies"", officials said, without giving details. At least 14 members of the police were injured. The FBI is now seeking to identify those involved,externalin the rampage, which came after Mr Trump had told a rally he would never concede the election and urged his supporters to march on the Capitol. It also came on the daytwo Democrats won Senate seats in elections in Georgia,giving the party effective control of the whole of Congress. This major political victory will ease the passage of Mr Biden's agenda after he is inaugurated. Democrat Joe Biden's victory was confirmed at about 03:30 local time (08:30 GMT) on Thursday in a joint session presided over by Republican Vice-President Mike Pence, who called the violence a ""dark day in the history of the United States Capitol"". Mr Biden blasted the ""insurrection"" as Mr Trump, while telling the mob to ""go home"", continued to make false claims of electoral fraud. The outgoing president's Twitter and Facebook accounts were later frozenand remain blocked. Objections by some Republican lawmakers to overturn the result in Arizona and Pennsylvania were rejected. Congress formally certified the final electoral college vote, with Mr Biden receiving 306 votes to Mr Trump's 232. For days Mr Trump had been piling pressure on his vice-president to block certification. But in a letter to Congress on Wednesday, Mr Pence said he had no ""unilateral authority to decide which electoral votes should be counted"". This video can not be played 'I just want the real winner to be president' In declaring the final vote totals, Mr Pence said this ""shall be deemed a sufficient declaration of the persons elected president and vice-president of the United States"". Shortly afterwards Mr Trump said in a statement: ""Even though I totally disagree with the outcome of the election, and the facts bear me out, nevertheless there will be an orderly transition on January 20th."" On Thursday the White House press office issued a statement saying it ""grieves the loss of life"" and will continue ""to pray for a speedy recovery for those who suffered injury"". This is how the Trump presidency ends. Not with a whimper, but with a bang. For weeks, Donald Trump had been pointing to 6 January as a day of reckoning. It was when he told his supporters to come to Washington DC, and challenge Congress - and Vice-President Mike Pence - to discard the results of November's election and keep the presidency in his hands. Crisis can bring political opportunity, and there are many politicians who will not hesitate to use it to gain advantage. Donald Trump - for now - is still in power. And while he may be chastened, he may be sitting in the White House residence watching television temporarily without his social media outlet, he will not be silent for long. And once he decamps for his new Florida home, he could begin making plans to settle scores and, perhaps, someday return to power and rebuild a legacy that, for the moment, lies in tatters.Biden win certified by Congress after chaotic day Read more from Anthony In addition to Mr Pence, some Republicans who previously stood by the president have now spoken out. Has the Capitol been attacked before? The people who still believe Trump won What is the electoral college? Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell definitively broke with Mr Trump in an emotional speech from the chamber floor on Wednesday, saying: ""If this election were overturned by mere allegations from the losing side, our democracy would enter a death spiral."" After the session resumed, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer blasted the mob at the Capitol as ""rioters and insurrectionists, goons and thugs, domestic terrorists"", saying the president ""bears a great deal of the blame"". This video can not be played ""We will never give up, we will never concede"", Trump tells supporters Senator Kelly Loeffler, who lost her bid for election in Georgia's vote on Tuesday, said she could no longer in good conscience vote against certification as she had originally planned, citing the ""abhorrent"" invasion of the Capitol. With two weeks before Mr Trump leaves office, there are calls for him to be removed beforehand for instigating the attack on Congress. US media say somemembers of his cabinet have discussed invoking the 25th amendment to the Constitution, which deals with removing a president deemed unfit for office. Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee have said that Mr Trump's actions meet the amendment's requirements. On Wednesday afternoon protesters surged up the Capitol steps shoving past barricades and officers in riot gear to penetrate the building. The mob - some of whom wore body armour - used chemical irritants to attack police, according to Washington police. They shouted and waved pro-Trump, US and Confederate flags as they roamed the halls, demanding the results of the presidential election be overturned. Members of Congress scrambled for cover under their seats as tear gas was fired. Several thousand National Guard troops, FBI agents and US Secret Service personnel were deployed to help overwhelmed Capitol police. The apparent ease with which Trump supporters were able to act has raised serious questions about security. Two pipe bombs were recovered, one from the Democratic National Committee offices, not far from the Capitol, and one from the nearby Republican National Committee headquarters. The occupation of the Capitol lasted more than three hours before the building was secured by law enforcement. At least 52 people have been arrested, the vast majority of them for violating the 18:00 to 06:00 curfew. Washington is under an extended state of emergency until after Mr Biden's inauguration. After sitting at the desk of US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, one protester left a message reading ""we will not back down"" Responding to the violence, Mr Biden said the mob's activity ""border[ed] on sedition"" and that democracy was ""under unprecedented assault"".

"This video can not be played When a mob stormed the US capitol The US Congress has certified Joe Biden's victory in the presidential election, hours after supporters of Donald Trump stormed the building in an attack that saw four people die. Lawmakers resumed the session after police removed a mob that had been encouraged by President Trump as part of his attempt to overturn his defeat. The certification clears the way for Mr Biden to be sworn in on 20 January. In response, Mr Trump finally pledged an ""orderly transition"" of power. Follow our live updates here Wednesday's chaotic scenes followed months of escalating rhetoric from Mr Trump and some Republican allies that sought to undermine the result of the 3 November election. The invasion of the Capitol by the president's supporters - some armed - was an event without precedent in modern American history. Washington DC Mayor Muriel Bowser said one of the four who died - a woman named as Ashli Babbitt - was part of a group that forced entry into the chamber of the House of Representatives while it was still in session. They were confronted by plainclothes officers, and an officer pulled out a weapon and fired it. What does a deadly day mean for Trump's legacy?

She was proclaimed dead at hospital. One woman and two men died as a result of ""medical emergencies"", officials said, without giving details. At least 14 members of the police were injured. The FBI is now seeking to identify those involved,externalin the rampage, which came after Mr Trump had told a rally he would never concede the election and urged his supporters to march on the Capitol. It also came on the daytwo Democrats won Senate seats in elections in Georgia,giving the party effective control of the whole of Congress. This major political victory will ease the passage of Mr Biden's agenda after he is inaugurated. Democrat Joe Biden's victory was confirmed at about 03:30 local time (08:30 GMT) on Thursday in a joint session presided over by Republican Vice-President Mike Pence, who called the violence a ""dark day in the history of the United States Capitol"". Mr Biden blasted the ""insurrection"" as Mr Trump, while telling the mob to ""go home"", continued to make false claims of electoral fraud. The outgoing president's Twitter and Facebook accounts were later frozenand remain blocked. Objections by some Republican lawmakers to overturn the result in Arizona and Pennsylvania were rejected. Congress formally certified the final electoral college vote, with Mr Biden receiving 306 votes to Mr Trump's 232. For days Mr Trump had been piling pressure on his vice-president to block certification. But in a letter to Congress on Wednesday, Mr Pence said he had no ""unilateral authority to decide which electoral votes should be counted"".

On Thursday the White House press office issued a statement saying it ""grieves the loss of life"" and will continue ""to pray for a speedy recovery for those who suffered injury"". This is how the Trump presidency ends. Not with a whimper, but with a bang. For weeks, Donald Trump had been pointing to 6 January as a day of reckoning. It was when he told his supporters to come to Washington DC, and challenge Congress - and Vice-President Mike Pence - to discard the results of November's election and keep the presidency in his hands. Crisis can bring political opportunity, and there are many politicians who will not hesitate to use it to gain advantage. Donald Trump - for now - is still in power. And while he may be chastened, he may be sitting in the White House residence watching television temporarily without his social media outlet, he will not be silent for long. And once he decamps for his new Florida home, he could begin making plans to settle scores and, perhaps, someday return to power and rebuild a legacy that, for the moment, lies in tatters.Biden win certified by Congress after chaotic day Read more from Anthony In addition to Mr Pence, some Republicans who previously stood by the president have now spoken out.

With two weeks before Mr Trump leaves office, there are calls for him to be removed beforehand for instigating the attack on Congress. US media say somemembers of his cabinet have discussed invoking the 25th amendment to the Constitution, which deals with removing a president deemed unfit for office. Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee have said that Mr Trump's actions meet the amendment's requirements. On Wednesday afternoon protesters surged up the Capitol steps shoving past barricades and officers in riot gear to penetrate the building. The mob - some of whom wore body armour - used chemical irritants to attack police, according to Washington police. They shouted and waved pro-Trump, US and Confederate flags as they roamed the halls, demanding the results of the presidential election be overturned. Members of Congress scrambled for cover under their seats as tear gas was fired. Several thousand National Guard troops, FBI agents and US Secret Service personnel were deployed to help overwhelmed Capitol police. The apparent ease with which Trump supporters were able to act has raised serious questions about security. Two pipe bombs were recovered, one from the Democratic National Committee offices, not far from the Capitol, and one from the nearby Republican National Committee headquarters. The occupation of the Capitol lasted more than three hours before the building was secured by law enforcement. At least 52 people have been arrested, the vast majority of them for violating the 18:00 to 06:00 curfew. Washington is under an extended state of emergency until after Mr Biden's inauguration.

"Medical staff are ""well over half way through"" vaccinating Scotland's care home residents with their first dose against Covid-19. The first minister said this was ""extremely important"", as care homes accounted for more than a third of Covid-related deaths in the past week. By Sunday more than 113,000 people in Scotland had been given their first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Some 1,100 vaccination centres are set to be operational within a week. The government has set a target of giving a first dose to everyone over the age of 80 in Scotland within the next four weeks. Scotland has about 30,000 residents living in care homes for older people. Where will I get my coronavirus vaccine? When will I be vaccinated against Covid? Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? A further 78 deaths of people who had tested positive for Covid-19 were announced on Thursday, the highest daily number during the second wave of the virus. Meanwhile, the National Records of Scotland said the virus had been mentioned on 183 death certificates in the week to Sunday - with 63 of these deaths occurring in care homes. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said this underlined the importance of rolling out the vaccine in care homes, saying it would hopefully start to significantly reduce the risk of residents dying due to coronavirus. And she said the government would start issuing a daily update on how many people had been given the jab from next week. The first minister said: ""Vaccination ultimately is what will provide us with the route out of this pandemic, so we are absolutely determined to make sure as many people as possible are vaccinated just as quickly as it is possible to do so."" As of Sunday, a total of 113,459 people had been given their first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in Scotland. The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccinebegan to be rolled out on Monday, and will be reflected in statistics from next week. A total of 36 people have had a second dose of the vaccine, with efforts now focused on giving a first jab to as many people as possible This means that people will now not receive their second dose for up to 12 weeks rather than within 21 days - a move that has beencriticised by some medics. But Chief Medical Officer Dr Gregor Smith said the first dose gave ""substantial"" protection against the virus. The vaccine is being rolled out to health and social care workers in the first instance, then care home residents and other over-80s. Eventually everyone in Scotland over the age of 18 - a total of 4.4m people - will be given a jab, although the government has refused to set targets beyond the initial phase due to uncertainty over supplies. Nicola Sturgeon has said Scotland is in a race between the vaccine and the virus The UK government had already committed to publishing vaccination figures on a daily basis, and the Scottish Conservatives had been pushing for the Scottish government to follow suit. Tory leader Douglas Ross said that ""publishing these numbers will increase transparency and give the public confidence that progress is being made in our fight against Covid-19"". The MP told BBC Scotland that he had been getting inquiries from constituents about when they could expect to get a jab, saying people ""need to know roughly where they are on that list and when they can expect to receive that vaccine"". Scottish Labour called on the government to backdate the statistics and to publish ""a detailed breakdown of how many people in each priority group has been vaccinated"". The party's health spokeswoman, Monica Lennon, said: ""Quicker progress must be made on securing vaccinations sites and vaccinators, including the contribution that community pharmacy teams can make."" At her daily briefing, Ms Sturgeon said over-80s should not worry if they had not yet been contacted about a vaccine appointment. She said these were being ""aligned with availability of supply"" in different local areas. The first minister said there was ""no need to phone your GP"", and that people would be ""contacted with an appointment as soon as possible"". She also said the government was considering ""as a matter of ongoing review"" whether tighter restrictions may still be needed. Scotland has been in a new lockdown since Tuesday, and Ms Sturgeon said it was ""probably too early"" for this to be reflected in the number of new infections. However she warned that the number of interactions people are having needed to be ""radically"" cut in order to slow the spread of the virus. She said shutting down construction, manufacturing and click-and-collect businesses was ""the kind of thing we need to look at if we have a concern that we are not sufficiently reducing the number of people who are out and about and interacting"".

"Nguyen Huy Hung was one of 39 people who died in a container en route from Belgium to Essex The father of a 15-year-old boy who was one of 39 people to die in a lorry trailer said he learned of his son's death through social media. Nguyen Huy Hung died in the sealed container en route from Belgium to Purfleet, Essex, in October 2019. His father, Nguyen Huy Tung, said the family could not believe it until ""we saw his body by our own eyes"" at the hospital. Eight men are being sentenced for their role in the people-smuggling operation. The bodies of 39 Vietnamese nationals were discovered in a refrigerated trailer on 23 October last year The 39 Vietnamese migrants, aged 15 to 44, were sealed inside the container for at least 12 hours. The Old Bailey heard how it became a ""tomb"" as temperatures reached an ""unbearable"" 38.5C (101F). The people trapped inside had used a metal pole to try to punch through the roof, but only managed to dent the interior. The supposed 'VIP' journey that killed 39 people Irish smuggling connection to Essex lorry deaths At a sentencing hearing set to last three days in front of Mr Justice Sweeney, some of their final desperate phone messages were played in court. In one message, a man spoke with ragged breaths as he apologised to his family. ""I can't breathe,"" he said. ""I want to come back to my family. Have a good life."" In the background, a voice could be heard pleading: ""Come on everyone. Open up, open up."" Prosecutor Jonathan Polnay read out statements from the victims' families, and the mother of another 15-year-old who died, Dinh Dinh Binh, said her family had ""not been able to get back to our normal life yet"". ""Our economic conditions and work are negatively affected,"" she said. ""We have had to sell some properties of the family to afford our life."" The 39 people who died in the back of a trailer as it crossed the North Sea between Zeebrugge and the UK Tran Hai Loc and his wife Nguyen Thi Van, both 35, were found huddled together in the trailer, and left behind two children, aged six and four. The children's grandfather, Tran Dinh Thanh, said: ""At the moment their children are very small - this incident will affect their future. ""Every day, when they come home from school they always look at the photos of their parents on the altar. The decease of both parents is a big loss to them."" The moment lorry driver Maurice Robinson opened the trailer door and discovered the bodies inside was captured on CCTV Phan Thi Thanh, 41, had sold the family home and left her son with his godmother before setting off on the journey. Her son, who is now being looked after by his father in the UK, said he felt ""very heartbroken with mum not around"". Haulier boss Ronan Hughes, 41, of Tyholland, County Monaghan, Ireland, was described as a ringleader of the operation. He closed his eyes as the phone messages were played to the court. Other defendants hung their heads. Both Maurice Robinson (l) and Ronan Hughes (r) admitted 39 counts of manslaughter in connection with the case Hughes had previously admitted manslaughter, as had 26-year-old lorry driver Maurice Robinson, from County Armagh, who discovered the bodies in the trailer. Eamonn Harrison, 24, of Newry, County Down, who dropped off the trailer at Zeebrugge port, and people-smuggler Gheorghe Nica, 43, were convicted of the same charge by a jury. They will be sentenced alongside Christopher Kennedy, 24, from County Armagh, Valentin Calota, 38, from Birmingham, Alexandru-Ovidiu Hanga, 28, of Hobart Road, Tilbury, Essex, and Gazmir Nuzi, 43, of Tottenham, north London, who were convicted for their role in the smuggling. Gheorghe Nica and Eamonn Harrison were both found guilty of manslaughter Mr Polnay said: ""These defendants were party to a sophisticated, long-running and profitable conspiracy to smuggle [mainly] Vietnamese migrants to the UK, in the back of lorries, in a deliberate and intentional breach of border control."" The fee was between Â£10,000 and Â£13,000 for each migrant, for the ""VIP route"", the court heard.

"Some supermarkets faced issues over the festive period due to ports disruption The UK meat industry has called for the early vaccination of workers to keep food supplies running smoothly during the coronavirus crisis. It warned that absences during the pandemic, coupled with disruption at ports, could hit food supply chains. An early vaccination call for supermarket staff was also made by the boss of Sainsbury's on Thursday. The government said the food industry remains ""well-prepared"" to make sure people have the food they need. The British Meat Processors Association (BMPA) said coronavirus and disruption at ports due to new systems brought in after the Brexit transition period were ""a severe challenge to the industry and to the smooth running of the nation's food supply chain"". It argued frontline workers in meat factories should get early vaccinations due to the risk of a rapid spread of the new strains of the virus among key workers. The government hasset out who will get vaccinated first, which starts with care home residents and the oldest and most vulnerable people. But Nick Allen, chief executive of the BMPA, said it would be logical to also prioritise key workers in the food industry. ""As the new coronavirus variant takes hold across the whole of the UK, we are hearing widespread reports of rapidly rising absences in the food supply chain,"" he said. Covid vaccine: When will you be eligible? Oxford vaccine rolled out to hundreds of GP sites in England Some firms supplying supermarkets ""are seeing a tripling of staff having to take time off work through illness or enforced self-isolation"", he added. Pressures on staff during the lockdown include illness, having to self-isolate, and childcare while some schools are closed under England's lockdown. Due to the specialised nature of meat production, if even a few key factory personnel such as the foreman or managers are absent, production can stop, Mr Allen said. Early vaccinations should not be restricted to the meat industry, according to Mr Allen. All key workers in the food industry should get early vaccinations, he said. Even supermarkets themselves are having problems with absences, he suggested. ""The key food supply chains ought to be prioritised,"" he said. ""All food industry key workers should be prioritised [for vaccination]"". The government is advised on vaccinations by a group of experts called the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). Professor Wei Shen Lim, Covid-19 Chair for the JCVI, said the committee's advice on vaccine prioritisation ""was developed with the aim of preventing as many deaths as possible."" ""As the single greatest risk of death from Covid-19 is older age, prioritisation is primarily based on age,"" he said. ""It is estimated that vaccinating everyone in the priority groups would prevent 99% of deaths, including those associated with occupational exposure to infection,"" the professor added. Sainsbury's boss Simon Roberts also called for early vaccinations for key workers on Thursday. ""My view is that priority has to be given to those that need it first,"" he said. ""Those on the frontline should be part of that as and when capacity becomes available."" Absence rates for Sainsbury's staff are lower than at the peak of the crisis, but are rising, and have stepped up in the last few days, he said. The Sainsbury's absence rate is currently 8%. The business has 172,000 employees. Asda said that it had seen an increase in employees self-isolating and shielding in line with the rising UK infection rate. However, it said that absence rates were still lower than at the peak of the pandemic. ""We are taking proactive steps to manage colleague absences by retaining temporary colleagues hired over the Christmas period and are bringing in additional temporary colleagues in those stores that need them the most,"" and Asda spokesman said. Tesco has asked clinically vulnerable staff to stay at home. Morrisons, meanwhile, is also seeing more absences, but the rate is still more than half that of the peak of the pandemic. It is also a bigger business having taken on 26,000 extra staff during the crisis. Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium said: ""While absence rates are currently rising, retailers are closely monitoring the situation in stores and distribution centres and supply chains continue to run smoothly. A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs said: ""As we have seen in recent months, the UK has a large, diverse and highly resilient food supply chain. ""We continue to closely monitor the situation and are working closely with the food industry on the workforce and absence related challenges presented by the pandemic."" They added that the food industry remains ""well-prepared"" to make sure people across the country have the food they need. UK ports have seen disruption due to the effects of coronavirus on trade and new systems brought in after the Brexit transition period. Mr Roberts of Sainsbury's said that, so far, the flow of goods from Europe is in decent shape, but there had been some problems in sending food to Northern Ireland.There is still some backlog in general merchandising, he added. However, Scottish seafood exporters warned on Thursday that they had been hit by the ""perfect storm of Brexit disruption"". ""Weakened by Covid-19, and the closure of the French border before Christmas, the end of the Brexit transition period has unleashed layer upon layer of administrative problems, resulting in queues, border refusals and utter confusion,"" said Donna Fordyce, chief executive of Seafood Scotland. She said IT problems in France meant consignments were diverted from Boulogne-sur-Mer to Dunkirk, ""which was unprepared as it wasn't supposed to be at the export frontline."" There have also been IT issues on the UK side with HMRC, she added. ""These businesses are not transporting toilet rolls or widgets,"" she said. ""They are exporting the highest quality, perishable seafood which has a finite window to get to markets in peak condition. If the window closes these consignments go to landfill."" The National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations alsowarned of delays to fish exports,externaldue to ""a brick wall of bureaucracy"". Why are there empty shelves in some supermarkets?

"PM says he has ""no doubt"" there is enough supply to vaccinate the first four priority groups by 15 February NHS CEO Sir Simon Stevens says there will be a ""huge acceleration"" in the vaccination programme over the coming weeks Army logistics expert Brigadier Phil Prosser says his mission is to get vaccines ""in arms not on shelves"" A further 1,162 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is being rolled out to hundreds of GP-run vaccination centres in England Nearly 1.5 million people across the UK have now had their first dose, Boris Johnson says A weekly doorstep round of applause returns at 20:00 GMT - under the new name of Clap for Heroes For the first time, Sweden is recommending face masks on public transport during rush hours Japan announces a new state of emergency for Tokyo and surrounding areas as infections reach record levels Global virus cases have exceeded 87m and nearly 1.9m have died during the pandemic, according to figures tracked by Johns Hopkins University Edited by Marie Jackson That's all from the live page today, thank you for joining us. Today's updates were the work of Alice Evans, Joseph Lee, Lauren Turner, Emma Owen, Mary O'Connor, Richard Morris, George Wright and Jennifer Meierhans. This page was edited by James Clarke. We'll be back tomorrow to bring you all the very latest. We'll be pausing our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic in a few minutes' time. If you're just catching up, here are some of the latest developments: Following the release of the official daily figures on coronavirus cases, deaths and other statistics, here's a look at the coronavirus epidemic in the UK, through graphs and charts: Alison HoltSocial affairs correspondent Hospital managers in areas with high numbers of Covid cases
say they are talking to residential and nursing homes about taking
patients to ease pressures. So how will this work? In England, each area should now have designated places with
high levels of infection control to take Covid positive patients who no longer
need hospital care. These beds might be in a separate care home â so called
âhot homesâ- or in the wing of an existing home, which operates with different
staff from the rest of the building. Many care providers have been reluctant to
even consider such a role after the high number of care home deaths in the
first wave. One care homeowner, who is taking Covid patients, says he
has some empty beds but with the new variant of the virus spreading so easily,
he wants his staff vaccinated as a priority. In addition, concerns over whether
homes are insured if they take Covid patients still havenât been addressed. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has just led a Downing Street news conference,
alongside NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens and
Brigadier Phil Prosser. Hereâs a quick recap of the key points: Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Staff at St George's Hospital in Tooting, south-west London Strong words from NHS England chief executive Sir Simon
Stevens about conspiracy theories that hospitals are not busy. He calls it an
insult to staff. One figure that is often used is the fact that around one in 10 beds are available â that is actually more than last year. But that does not tell you the full story Hospitals have only been able to achieve this by
cancelling planned care â that includes routine treatments like hip and knee
operations but also, in some places, urgent cancer care. More intensive care beds have been opened â there are a
fifth more than there were at the start of November. But there is not a space or the specialist staff to run
these. So staff are being redeployed and wards turned into
emergency intensive care areas. One in three patients in UK hospitals now has Covid â in
some areas it is as high as one in two. This is stretching the health service to the limit. NHS England's chief executive Simon Stevens was earlier asked about concerns from NHS staff about people who falsely claim the virus is ""fake news"" and that hospitals are empty. In his response calling the claims an ""insult"" to NHS staff, Sir Simon also praised media reporting on the real pressures hospitals are facing, including the BBC's. The BBC's Medical editor, Fergus Walsh, hasreturned to an intensive care unit at University College Hospital, in central London. It was the same intensive care unit that he first visited in April, during the first peak of the pandemic. Shell-shocked staff have told of the physical and mental toll the pandemic is having on them. ""My emotions are all over the place. Scared, sad, petrified, worried,"" one ICU nurse said. This video can not be played ICU hospital staff: 'Scared, sad, petrified, worried' Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online These new life-saving Covid drugs,tocilizumab and sarilumab,may be hard to pronounce but they are easy to
give. And the NHS already has stocks of them, meaning the sickest patients can
receive doses immediately, to save hundreds more lives. This treatment
breakthrough couldn't come soon enough. There are more than 30,000 Covid
patients in hospitals around the UK - far more than during the peak of last
April. In trials, it has been found the new drugs cut deaths by a quarter,
saving around one extra life for every 12 people treated. They also speed up
recovery and reduce the length of time that critically-ill patients need to
spend in intensive care by about a week The next question comes from the Evening Standard's Sophia Sleigh. She says London's hospitals are ""staring into the abyss"" , and less than two weeks off being overwhelmed by the surge in the number of coronavirus patients. ""Why wasn't more done to stop us ending up here?"" she asks. Sir Simon answers by saying the UK's four chief medical officers acted to move the UK's risk level up to level five on Monday - which reflected the strain on the NHS. He adds that the London Nightingale field hospital expects to open to patients next week - and says it will also be used as a vaccination centre. In response to Sleigh's second question, about how and when life might return back to normal, the PM says ""there will be the chance to look at some relaxations of restrictions"" by 15 February. However, he says this will only be the case if the vaccination programme goes ahead with the speed expected, and no further new variants of the virus develop by then. Johnson says reopening schools will ""certainly be the priority"" in any review of lockdown rules. ""I do think things will be much better by the spring,"" he adds. That brings an end to today's press conference. Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent I was struck today by the language, tone and palpable anger from the prime minister and Sir Simon Stevens about the drivel that floats around on the internet about the pandemic. The prime minister said those who've turned up outside hospitals suggesting Coronavirus is a scam should ""grow up."" And Sir Simon, whose public manner is normally measured and reserved, is clearly furious at some of the stuff he has seen on social media. ""It's a lie"" he said pointedly at claims hospitals are actually quite quiet and ""most obviously untrue"". Instead, he said, people should rely on established media sources - as he name checked ITV, Sky News, Channel 4 and the BBC. Will James of Reuters asks Sir Simon if he can guarantee people who have had their first Pfizer jab will get their second. Sir Simon confirms they will get a second jab. He says the gap between vaccines also means it can be offered to many more people. James also asks the PM for the final toll that will be seen by spring. Boris Johnson says he cannot give that number - but that it will be ""tragically far too high"". ""Every death is a tragedy, we mourn every person we lose in this pandemic,"" he adds. The ""overall toll"" will depend on the success of the vaccination programme - and also on everyone working together to stop transmission of the virus and protect the NHS. Chris Smith of The Times asks if Covid and other patients will be able to receive a normal standard of care in the NHS. Secondly, he asks if the government will move to younger age groups to make sure 13 million people end up being vaccinated. Simon Stevens of the NHS says ""uptake is likely to be high"" of the Covid vaccine, following on from high numbers of people taking the flu jab this winter. He says ""people have heard that message"" on the vaccine and the NHS is getting a ""good response"" when people are being offered the vaccine. He adds that the situation in London is ""very serious"" following the new variant of Covid, saying NHS hospitals in London are receiving 800 Covid patients a day, which is the equivalent of St Thomas' Hospital. Hospitals are expanding critical care areas so these can be surged when demand is necessary, but he warns ""it is vital that the infection rate now comes under control"". Boris Johnson adds it is ""important"" that the government sets high ""stretching"" targets for vaccination, as the NHS is under ""extreme pressure already"" and high levels of vaccination is what the public wants, to avoid further lockdowns. Johnson says people who claim hospitals are empty 'need to grow up' Victoria Macdonald from Channel 4 asks the prime minister if he regrets not locking down earlier - given that many patients now in hospital will have been infected before Christmas. Boris Johnson says that the government learned of the new variant on 18 December and tier four measures were put in place the next day for the vast bulk of the country. Macdonald also asks about concern from NHS staff about people out there who falsely claim the virus is ""fake news"" and that hospitals are empty. Johnson replies these people ""need to grow up"", saying that we have already heard from Sir Simon how much pressure the NHS is under. We all need to do our bit to protect it, he says. For the vast majority, this means staying home to protect the NHS - and for those invited to take the vaccine, to have the jab. Sir Simon says that if people sneak into a hospital late at night and film an empty corridor, they are responsible for potentially changing behaviour that will kill people. It is an ""insult"" to the intensive care nurse, working 12 hour shifts in the most trying of circumstances, he adds. ""There is nothing more demoralising than having that kind of nonsense spouted when it is obviously untrue,"" says Sir Simon, praising reports on Channel 4, the BBC, ITV and Sky for reporting what is actually going on in hospitals. ITV's Emily Morgan asks the PM to clarify why some GPs have reported not receiving regular supplies of the coronavirus vaccine, despite having capacity to administer doses. The prime minister says ""to the best of my knowledge we are rolling out supplies of both vaccines to GP surgeries"", and repeats his earlier remark - that there will be roughly 1,000 primary care vaccination centres up and running across the country by the end of the week. He insists the supply of both vaccines is being rolled out but adds: ""I won't hide from you - of course, in the early phases, there's going to be lumpiness and bumpiness in the distribution. Today it may be that some GPs aren't getting the consignment that they expected."" Sir Simon adds that today is the first day of the vaccine rollout by GPs - and that with more than a thousand locations for the vaccine to be delivered to on a daily basis, there will be bumps along the road. ""We've just got to have a sense of gathering round to get this thing done as a big team effort, rather than poking and prodding [at small bumps in the road],"" he says. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Lots of detail has been given about how the NHS â working
hand-in-hand with the military â will be able to deliver the vaccines. There will be more local vaccination centres, hospital
hubs and even mass vaccination at sports stadiums. Thousands of extra vaccinators have already been trained
â and thousands more are waiting in the wings. But the biggest hurdle the UK faces is vaccine supply. If it is not available, it cannot be put in arms no
matter how many centres and vaccinators we have. In the long term supply is not going to be a problem â
two vaccines have already been approved and there are encouraging signs others
will follow. But in the short term everything depends on how quickly a
plant in Wrexham can get the vaccine produced by Astrazeneca into vials and
then how quickly the regulator can carry out the safety checks. At the moment there is thought to be only a few million
doses ready for the NHS â with another 15 million or so going through this
system. The target to vaccinate the most at risk groups by mid-February is achievable â but it will require a lot to go right. The BBC's Alex Forsyth asks if Donald Trump was responsible for inciting the storming of Congress in Washington DC. She also asks if the government can deliver in their promises on the vaccine. Boris Johnson says the US has stood for ""freedom"" and ""democracy"". He says what Mr Trump has done, casting doubt on the election result, was ""completely wrong"". He says he condemns anyone who would encourage people to behave the way they did in the Capitol. He says he is ""very pleased"" that democracy has prevailed and Joe Biden is the President-Elect. But he says the purpose of this press conference is to hear more detail on the vaccine roll-out. He adds that on Monday, there will be a further press conference with Matt Hancock giving specific details on the vaccination programme. Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent It is inevitable that part of the politics of a pandemic is the perceived relative performance of different countries. You can pick your metric to make your comparison, and plenty have. The death toll in the UK, and the economic slump, have come in for particular criticism. But the government has, for some time, sought to emphasise how the UK is ahead of the game on vaccinations. The UK was considerably quicker than the EU, for instance, in licencing the first vaccine, from Pfizer-BioNTech. At today's news conference, the Prime Minister has pointed out that the UK has already given more people a first jab for Covid than all the other countries in Europe put together. Sir Simon Stevens, the Chief Executive of the National Health Service in England, added that the UK has jabbed four times as many people as Germany and 300 times more than France. But he acknowledged the scale of the ongoing challenge - trying to vaccinate as many people in the next five weeks as normally happens in five months with the flu jab. One final thought: ministers tend to suggest international comparisons are pointless or premature when the comparisons are less than flattering. They're rather keener on them when the numbers look better. Stephen from Sheffield asks how the government is supporting students In his second question from the public, Johnson is asked how the government is supporting university students at this time. The PM says the government needs to ""look hard"" at the deal students have been given and ""what we can do to support students"" and help them at this very difficult time. Many cannot go back to university except for key practical courses, he notes. The PM says he understands the frustrations - and especially the ""financial frustrations that entails"". He tells the questioner, Stephen, from Sheffield that the issue is being looked at - and that he will be hearing more on this from the education secretary. After hearing from Brigadier Phil Prosser, the Downing Street coronavirus conference is now turning to questions from members of the public. Judith from Leeds asks how early years provision can safely remain open, if primary schools have been deemed a ""vector"" for spreading coronavirus. The PM says the ""whole point is that we believe that schools are safe"", as is, he says, early years provision - but ""we have to look at the overall budget of risk - the overall spread that schools can be involved in"". He adds that it is ""very important"" to keep early years education open to help key workers stay at work during the pandemic. NHS CEO Sir Simon Stevens adds that many health service staff rely on having available childcare - so keeping early years open is ""hugely important to the NHS's effort"" to tackle the virus. Brigadier Phil Prosser, Commander of Military Support to the Vaccine Delivery Programme, is now speaking. He says his team are drawing on their logistics knowledge from previous military operations to help roll out the vaccine. He says the ""mission"" in this case is to ""support the NHS"" and to ""minimise the number of deaths, as quickly and as safely as possible"". But, he warns, the plan has ""many challenges"". The Army has to make sure that vaccines are available across the UK, and in the case of the Pfizer vaccine, have to be stored at -70C. This means ""the plan needs to be agile,"" he adds. He says the Army plans to distribute the vaccine as soon as it receives each dose, adding ""it needs to be in arms, not on shelves"". Something on this scale ""has not been done before, and we are learning as we go"", he says, and the logistics operation is ""unparalleled in its scale and complexity"". It is the equivalent, he says, of setting up a major supermarket chain in less than a month. Â© 2025 BBC.

Just some of the terms used by members of Congress to describe those who invaded the seat of US government on Wednesday. This video can not be played The words lawmakers used to describe Capitol riot The storming of the US Capitol building in Washington DC stunned viewers around the world. But how did Americans feel seeing the seat of their government being ransacked? A new US citizen, a diehard Trump supporter, an anti-Trump Republican and a young Black Lives Matter protester - all members of our BBC voter panel - weighed in. Read what they said. Almost 60 Democratic members of the US House of Representatives have backed new articles of impeachment against the Republican president over Wednesday's unrest. Congresswoman Ilhan Omar said in a tweet on Thursday that dozens of lawmakers had offered their support to the resolution that she and other members, including Rashida Tlaib, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Cori Bush, had prepared.

Donald Trump, who leaves office on 20 January, was impeached by the Democratic-held House in 2019 after he was accused of abusing his power and obstructing Congress. He was acquitted by the Republican-led Senate. Leading Democrats have also called for the president to be removed under the 25th Amendment, which allows the vice-president to step up if the president is unable to perform his duties owing to a mental or physical illness. It would require Vice-President Mike Pence and at least eight cabinet members to break with Mr Trump and invoke the amendment - something they have so far seemed unlikely to do. In a short press briefing that ran less than two minutes, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany condemned the armed insurrection at the US Capitol ""in the strongest possible terms"". Speaking ""on behalf of the entire White House"", she called the violence ""appalling, reprehensible and antithetical to the American way"". McEnany left the briefing room without taking any questions. President Trump has not been seen in public today and his social media accounts remain suspended. Washington DC's top prosecutor has not ruled out the possibility that the president himself could be investigated over the Capitol riot. Acting attorney general for the District of Columbia, Michael Sherwin, said ""all actors"" will be looked at. Asked whether this included Trump, Sherwin responded: âWeâre looking at all actors here and anyone that had a role and, if the evidence fits the elements of the crime, theyâre going to be charged."" The president had urged his supporters at a rally outside the White House to march on Congress, while pushing unfounded claims of electoral fraud. As events spiralled out of control, he tweeted urging them to ""remain peaceful"". The Association of Flight Attendants - a labour union that represents nearly 50,000 air crew - says it is ""taking a hard line for flight safety"" after problems aboard several flights to Washington DC. Citing the Capitol riot and the possibility that some participants might soon be flying back home, AFA President Sara Nelson suggested the culprits should be banned from planes. ""Acts against our democracy, our government, and the freedom we claim as 
Americans must disqualify these individuals from the freedom of flight."" In a video that went viral on social media, Trump supporters on a packed flight to the DC area heckled Senator Mitt Romney with chants of ""Traitor"". Trump's former chief of staff, John Kelly, has said he would vote to remove the president from office if he were still part of the cabinet. ""Yes, I would,"" Kelly, who served under Trump from 2017-18, told CNN's Jake Tapper in an interview on Thursday. ""The one thing we have going for us here, Jake, is that it's only 13 more days"", he added in reference to Biden's inauguration on 20 January. Wednesday's invasion of the Capitol has revived political talk of removing Trump from office via a constitutional amendment. Here's our explainer: What is the 25th Amendment? Allow Twitter content?

Today, the Senate's top Democrat joined voices calling for Trump's presidential powers to be removed immediately after his supporters violently stormed the US Capitol on Wednesday. Under the 25th Amendment, the vice-president can become acting president when a president is unable to continue his duties, if for example, he or she becomes incapacitated due to a physical or mental illness. The part of the amendment being discussed is section four, which allows the vice-president and a majority of the cabinet to declare President Trump unable to perform his duties. Find out more about the 25th Amendment here. The day before she died, Ashli Babbitt wrote on social media about the gathering of Trump supporters in the US capital. ""Nothing will stop us,"" she wrote. ""They can try and try and try but the storm is here and it is descending upon DC in less than 24 hours."" Babbitt, 35, was among the mob that breached the US Capitol on Wednesday. She has been identified by US Capitol Police as one of four people who died amid the chaos. A veteran of the US Air Force, Babbitt served two tours in Afghanistan and Iraq before later deployments with the National Guard to Kuwait and Qatar, her ex-husband, Timothy McEntee, told US media. A native of San Diego, California, Ms Babbitt had recently remarried, and worked at a pool service company with her husband, Aaron Babbitt. On social media, Babbitt described herself as a libertarian and patriot. She posted frequently about President Trump, expressing ardent support for him and echoing his unproven claims of wide-scale voter fraud. ""She had a personality that you either loved or hated,"" McEntee told NPR. ""She wasn't apologetic about it... she was proud of it, just like she was proud of her country and proud to be an American."" Read the full story here. Former First Lady Michelle Obama said Wednesday's events at the US Capitol ""desecrated the centre of American government"". In a lengthy statement released on social media, Obama said: ""Seeing the gulf between the responses to yesterday's riot and this 
summer's peaceful protests and the larger movement for racial justice is
 so painful. It hurts."" Decrying the sight of ""the traitorous flag of the Confederacy"", she lamented the ""cracked skulls and mass arrests"" that she said had been seen at Black Lives Matter protests. ""Millions voted for a man so obviously willing to burn down our democracy for his own ego,"" she said. She called on social media platforms to ""stop enabling this monstrous behaviour"" and permanently ban Trump. Obama also urged people to engage in ""the uncomfortable, sometimes painful process"" of ""putting America back together"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

As violent Trump supporters surged past barricades and into the US Capitol, news agency photographers - who were there to document the vote certifying Joe Biden's election win - captured extraordinary scenes. The last time government buildings were breached in Washington was in 1814 and the invaders were British soldiers. But in 2021 a Trump supporter, carrying the Confederate flag, is walking freely through the halls near the entrance to the Senate, encountering little resistance. Another image showed a rioter holding a podium bearing the seal of the Speaker of the House, while a third showed a man with a boot on the desk of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Yesterday's riots took place at the US Capitol - one of the country's most important buildings. It's the area of Washington DC - the capital city of the United States - where Congress is situated. This is where the US government writes, debates and passes laws. The Hill is centred around the US Capitol building - the main location protesters broke into. This is where elected officials in the Senate and the House of Representatives sit when debating and voting on laws, making up the upper and lower chambers of Congress. As well as these chambers, there are other office buildings where lawmakers and their staff work and meet to do their business. Find out more here. With his ban on Facebook and Instagram extended, President Donald Trump was notably absent on Wednesday as the US took stock of yesterday's events at the Capitol. According to the White House, one of his tasks for the day included presenting the country's highest civilian award, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, to three golfers - among them Babe Zaharias, who was honoured posthumously. Annika Sorenstam and Gary Player also received the honour. If you're just joining our live coverage, here are the top stories of the day so far: The
 US is reeling after supporters of President Trump stormed the Capitol 
building in Washington DC on the day Congress was meeting to confirm Joe
 Biden's election victory. Lawmakers
 were forced to take shelter, the building was put into lockdown and 
four people died in the chaos that followed a pro-Trump rally near the 
White House. Here's a breakdown of how events unfolded on Wednesday. Nga PhamBBC News South Vietnam flags were seen during the unrest On Wednesday, as protesters gathered outside before
swarming the Capitol building, the
yellow flags of the old South Vietnam regime could be seen. In fact, the yellow flags of the former South Vietnam are a common sight at
pro-Trump rallies across the United States. Vietnamese Americans, especially those of the older generation who fled Vietnam after
Saigon fell in 1975, are known for their support for the Republican party and
Donald Trump. A pre-election survey by the group Asian and Pacific Islander
American Vote found thatVietnamese Americans are the only major East Asian ethnic community that favoured Trump over Biden,external. Trumpâs anti-China and anti-communist rhetoric resonated greatly with the former refugees who risked their lives to escape
communism. But the support
for President Trump has also become an increasingly divisive issue amongst the
Vietnamese American community. Hours after the
Capitol riot, there are still calls on pro-Trump internet forums like
the ""ABC Trump"" Facebook page for Vietnamese Americans to âtake to
the streets in support of President Trumpâ as âthe battle
continuesâ. But there have also been condemnations. âThis is embarrassing,â
one young Vietnamese American wrote on Twitter, adding: âTheyâve brought shame to
the flagâ. Frank GardnerBBC Security Correspondent Saudi Arabia has been a close ally of the Trump administration Jihadist supporters of both the Islamic State group (IS) and al-Qaeda have been celebrating online the scenes of chaos and violence in Washington. The extremists and proponents of violent jihad - who view the US as their number one enemy - have been sharing images and videos from Capitol Hill, mocking American democracy and expressing hope that division will spread across the country. There was no immediate comment from either groupâs leadership on their official media outlets. The events will have deeply worried Americaâs allies in the Middle East, for whom the US acts as a security guarantor. Saudi Arabiaâs leaders, who had a close relationship with the Trump administration and who waited days before congratulating President-elect Joe Biden, will now be hoping for a period of calm. Sergeant-at-arms Paul Irving, who was responsible for maintaining law and order in the US House of Representatives, has resigned. His resignation was announced by Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi at her press conference moments ago. The top Democrat also said that she is calling for the resignation of Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund, who she says has not spoken to her on the phone once since violence was unleashed on the Capitol yesterday. Earlier today, her counterpart in the Senate, Chuck Schumer, said he would fire the Senate's sergeant-at-arms once Democrats become the majority in the chamber. Members of the Washington DC National Guard protect the Capitol on Wednesday night At a press conference earlier, Washington DC's mayor described yesterday's protests as ""textbook terrorism"" and ""an affront to democracy"". Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, squarely blamed Trump for inciting the violence seen yesterday. During the press conference, police also identified all four people that died during the chaos. Ashli Babbitt, a 35-year-old military veteran from California, was shot by a plainclothes Capitol police officer, according to Washington DC Police Chief Robert Contee. Benjamin Phillips, 50, Kevin Greeson, 55, and Rosanne Boyland, 34, also died after suffering ""medical emergencies"", he said. The three travelled from Pennsylvania, Alabama and Georgia respectively. This video can not be played Pelosi: 'President incited armed insurrection against US' Top Democrat Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House of Representatives, is giving a news conference now where she says she has a message for Trump's cabinet members. ""Do they stand by these actions? Are they ready to say for the next 13 days that this dangerous man can do more harm to our democracy?"" Pelosi goes on to say that the House may be forced to file of articles of impeachment due to Trump's recent ""seditious acts"". ""Although it's only 13 days left, any day could be a horror show,"" she tells reporters. Pelosi adds that Democrats are contacting her, demanding another attempt to remove Trump from office. To remind you, Trump has already been impeached once, by the Democrat-led House in December 2019 over allegations he improperly sought help from Ukraine to boost his chances of re-election. If impeached again, he would be the first president in US history to be impeached twice. ""My phone is exploding with 'impeach impeach impeach',"" she says. Â© 2025 BBC.

"With the country in lockdown and a new faster-spreading variant of coronavirus rampant, it's clear the UK is in a race to vaccinate. Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants all the over-70s, the most clinically vulnerable and front-line health and care workers to be offered a jab by mid-February, to allow the restrictions to be eased. That requires about 13 million people to be given the opportunity to be vaccinated - but so far only one million have been. And ensuring a quick rollout to the rest is fraught with difficulties. There is enough vaccine in the country, BBC News has learned, but getting it into people's arms could be hampered by: a global shortage of glass vials to package up the vaccines long waits for safety checks the process of ensuring there are enough vaccinators Two Covid vaccines have now been approved - one produced by Pfizer-BioNTech and another made by Oxford University and AstraZeneca. The UK government has ordered 140 million doses - enough for the whole population. The first hurdle is manufacture of the vaccine. This involves two crucial stages - the production of the substance and then a process called fill and finish whereby the vaccine is put into vials and packaged up for use. And there is already a concern about the latter stage, with the availability of key ingredients and equipment including glass vials a key issue. England's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam says fill and finish was a ""critically short resource across the globe"". That is part of the reason why the amount of the two vaccines ready to go is more limited than ministers had hoped. UK plants have made somewhere around 15 million or so doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine - that in itself is less than ministers said would be made at this stage (early in the pandemic they said there would be 30 million by the autumn). But only four million have been through the fill-and-finish process. The UK has used plants in Germany and the Netherlands to do some of this for the early batches. But the government has also invested in a plant in Wrexham to ensure there is domestic capacity. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, meanwhile, is made outside of the UK - it comes from a plant in Belgium. When it arrives in the UK, it has already been placed into vials. But so far, fewer than five million doses have been delivered - less than half the number that should have been - because of problems with manufacture, including the fill-and-finish process. However, the Department of Health and Social Care said it had been monitoring the supply chain for ""some time"" and was confident the arrangements in place for the supply and onward deployment of vaccines were sufficient. What are the safety checks for vaccines? Who will get the Covid vaccine first? Even once a vaccine is in the vials though, there is still one more step before the NHS can start using it. Each batch has to be checked and certified by the Medicines and Healthcare Products regulatory Agency. And it can be several weeks before the vaccine can be given to the NHS to put in people's arms. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has called this a ""rate-limiting factor"". About four million doses of the Oxford vaccine have been available for some weeks - they were put into vials last year - but as yet only just over 500,000 have been certified as safe to use. Sources close to the NHS vaccination programme said this had been one of the key frustrations - saying it was taking up to 20 days for batches to be tested and released. The MHRA said each batch had to be biologically tested for quality, while the manufacturer's documentation describing its production and quality-control testing process was reviewed. Those close to the process say it does take a couple of weeks - and with more vaccine being produced, there is increased demand on the labs that do the work. ""You have to remember this is being injected into people,"" they said. ""We cannot rush this."" Both vaccines have to go through this process. Once batches have been certified, they are ready to be distributed to the NHS vaccination centres. Eventually, there will be a network of more than 1,000 local centres across the UK. Currently, just over 700 are up and running. These are being run from a wide variety of venues, from hospitals and large GP centres to community venues, racecourses and, perhaps in the future, conference centres and sports stadiums. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters TREATMENT:How close are we to helping people? The instability of the Pfizer-BioNTech has been well documented. It has to be kept in ultra-cold storage and, once thawed, used within five days. This has meant it is stored at major hospitals and gives the local vaccination centres just days to use up batches after they are delivered. The Oxford vaccine, meanwhile, can be stored at fridge temperature, which makes it easier to distribute. But even once they are at these vaccination centres, delivery of both vaccines is dependent on having the right numbers of staff available. Currently, GPs, nurses, healthcare assistants and pharmacists are giving the vaccines. But as the vaccination campaign ramps up, these will need to be supplemented by additional vaccinators. Provision has been made to train other health professionals, from physiotherapists and dentists to dieticians. But there are reports an ""overload of bureaucracy"" - including mandatory courses in fire safety and preventing radicalisation - is slowing down this training. Ministers have said they will try to reduce the bureaucracy - amid warnings by the National Audit Office an army of nearly 50,000 vaccinators will be needed. Although at the moment, there are thought to be enough staff to cope with the limited amount of vaccines available. British Medical Association GP leader Dr Richard Vautrey said: ""We will need support eventually but not now. ""At the moment, the biggest issue is the NHS having enough supply of the vaccine to give."" Nearly a million doses have been given since people started to receive the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, in early December, which puts the UK third globally in the most vaccinations done per head. And with the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine being used from this week, the NHS is hoping to double that number in the next seven days. Government sources said there would be disappointment if it did not reach two million doses a week by late January. That - and a little bit more - will be needed to hit the mid-February target. But even then, and assuming most people in these priority groups have come forward, the impact would not be immediate. It takes a few weeks for the immune response to kick in. So it would be early March before the full impact of the vaccination of these priority groups is felt. Then, however, it could have a significant effect. Close to nine in 10 Covid deaths have been in these priority groups. They will have had only one dose, which, for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, is effective at preventing 70% of infections. But the evidence suggests this will be enough to stop serious illness. So if all goes to plan, the pathway to significantly easing restrictions comes into view. But the complex nature of the supply chain coupled with the complexity of delivering vaccines to large numbers of people means it will take just one thing to go wrong to cause serious problems getting the UK out of this lockdown in the timeframe hoped.

"This video can not be played When a mob stormed the US capitol The US Congress has certified Joe Biden's victory in the presidential election, hours after supporters of Donald Trump stormed the building in an attack that saw four people die. Lawmakers resumed the session after police removed a mob that had been encouraged by President Trump as part of his attempt to overturn his defeat. The certification clears the way for Mr Biden to be sworn in on 20 January. In response, Mr Trump finally pledged an ""orderly transition"" of power. Follow our live updates here Wednesday's chaotic scenes followed months of escalating rhetoric from Mr Trump and some Republican allies that sought to undermine the result of the 3 November election. The invasion of the Capitol by the president's supporters - some armed - was an event without precedent in modern American history. Washington DC Mayor Muriel Bowser said one of the four who died - a woman named as Ashli Babbitt - was part of a group that forced entry into the chamber of the House of Representatives while it was still in session. They were confronted by plainclothes officers, and an officer pulled out a weapon and fired it. What does a deadly day mean for Trump's legacy? In pictures: Pro-Trump protesters storm Capitol 'They tried to break in - then I heard a shot' The US Capitol Police said the employee involved had been put on administrative leave pending an investigation. This video can not be played The US Congress has formally confirmed Joe Biden's victory Local media said Ashli Babbitt was a San Diego-area US Air Force veteran and Trump supporter. She was proclaimed dead at hospital. One woman and two men died as a result of ""medical emergencies"", officials said, without giving details. At least 14 members of the police were injured. The FBI is now seeking to identify those involved,externalin the rampage, which came after Mr Trump had told a rally he would never concede the election and urged his supporters to march on the Capitol. It also came on the daytwo Democrats won Senate seats in elections in Georgia,giving the party effective control of the whole of Congress. This major political victory will ease the passage of Mr Biden's agenda after he is inaugurated. Democrat Joe Biden's victory was confirmed at about 03:30 local time (08:30 GMT) on Thursday in a joint session presided over by Republican Vice-President Mike Pence, who called the violence a ""dark day in the history of the United States Capitol"". Mr Biden blasted the ""insurrection"" as Mr Trump, while telling the mob to ""go home"", continued to make false claims of electoral fraud. The outgoing president's Twitter and Facebook accounts were later frozenand remain blocked. Objections by some Republican lawmakers to overturn the result in Arizona and Pennsylvania were rejected. Congress formally certified the final electoral college vote, with Mr Biden receiving 306 votes to Mr Trump's 232. For days Mr Trump had been piling pressure on his vice-president to block certification. But in a letter to Congress on Wednesday, Mr Pence said he had no ""unilateral authority to decide which electoral votes should be counted"". This video can not be played 'I just want the real winner to be president' In declaring the final vote totals, Mr Pence said this ""shall be deemed a sufficient declaration of the persons elected president and vice-president of the United States"". Shortly afterwards Mr Trump said in a statement: ""Even though I totally disagree with the outcome of the election, and the facts bear me out, nevertheless there will be an orderly transition on January 20th."" On Thursday the White House press office issued a statement saying it ""grieves the loss of life"" and will continue ""to pray for a speedy recovery for those who suffered injury"". This is how the Trump presidency ends. Not with a whimper, but with a bang. For weeks, Donald Trump had been pointing to 6 January as a day of reckoning. It was when he told his supporters to come to Washington DC, and challenge Congress - and Vice-President Mike Pence - to discard the results of November's election and keep the presidency in his hands. Crisis can bring political opportunity, and there are many politicians who will not hesitate to use it to gain advantage. Donald Trump - for now - is still in power. And while he may be chastened, he may be sitting in the White House residence watching television temporarily without his social media outlet, he will not be silent for long. And once he decamps for his new Florida home, he could begin making plans to settle scores and, perhaps, someday return to power and rebuild a legacy that, for the moment, lies in tatters.Biden win certified by Congress after chaotic day Read more from Anthony In addition to Mr Pence, some Republicans who previously stood by the president have now spoken out. Has the Capitol been attacked before? The people who still believe Trump won What is the electoral college? Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell definitively broke with Mr Trump in an emotional speech from the chamber floor on Wednesday, saying: ""If this election were overturned by mere allegations from the losing side, our democracy would enter a death spiral."" After the session resumed, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer blasted the mob at the Capitol as ""rioters and insurrectionists, goons and thugs, domestic terrorists"", saying the president ""bears a great deal of the blame"". This video can not be played ""We will never give up, we will never concede"", Trump tells supporters Senator Kelly Loeffler, who lost her bid for election in Georgia's vote on Tuesday, said she could no longer in good conscience vote against certification as she had originally planned, citing the ""abhorrent"" invasion of the Capitol. With two weeks before Mr Trump leaves office, there are calls for him to be removed beforehand for instigating the attack on Congress. US media say somemembers of his cabinet have discussed invoking the 25th amendment to the Constitution, which deals with removing a president deemed unfit for office. Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee have said that Mr Trump's actions meet the amendment's requirements. On Wednesday afternoon protesters surged up the Capitol steps shoving past barricades and officers in riot gear to penetrate the building. The mob - some of whom wore body armour - used chemical irritants to attack police, according to Washington police. They shouted and waved pro-Trump, US and Confederate flags as they roamed the halls, demanding the results of the presidential election be overturned. Members of Congress scrambled for cover under their seats as tear gas was fired. Several thousand National Guard troops, FBI agents and US Secret Service personnel were deployed to help overwhelmed Capitol police. The apparent ease with which Trump supporters were able to act has raised serious questions about security. Two pipe bombs were recovered, one from the Democratic National Committee offices, not far from the Capitol, and one from the nearby Republican National Committee headquarters. The occupation of the Capitol lasted more than three hours before the building was secured by law enforcement. At least 52 people have been arrested, the vast majority of them for violating the 18:00 to 06:00 curfew. Washington is under an extended state of emergency until after Mr Biden's inauguration. After sitting at the desk of US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, one protester left a message reading ""we will not back down"" Responding to the violence, Mr Biden said the mob's activity ""border[ed] on sedition"" and that democracy was ""under unprecedented assault"". ""To storm the Capitol, to smash windows, to occupy offices on the floor of the United States Senate, rummaging through desks, on the House of Representatives, threatening the safety of duly elected officials. It's not protest; it's insurrection."" This video can not be played Joe Biden: The scenes of chaos at the Capitol do not reflect a true America, do not represent who we are Mr Trump posted a recorded video on Twitter saying: ""I know your pain. I know you're hurt... We had an election that was stolen from us. It was a landslide election, and everyone knows it, especially the other side. But you have to go home now. We have to have peace."" For the first time, Twitter froze Mr Trump's account, saying it would be locked for 12 hours. The social media giant demanded he delete three tweets that it said could stoke violence and threatening ""permanent suspension"". Facebook and Instagram followed suit. Hours earlier, Mr Trump had addressed a ""Save America Rally"" outside the White House, where he encouraged supporters to keep contesting the election result: ""Our country has had enough and we will not take it anymore."" Political figures from around the worldcondemned the violence.In the US, former President Barack Obama said history would rightly remember the assault on the Capitol as ""as a moment of great dishonour and shame for our nation"". Former President George W Bush said: ""It is a sickening & heartbreaking sight. This is how election results are disputed in a banana republic - not our democratic republic.""

"This video can not be played ""We will never give up, we will never concede"", Trump tells supporters This is how the Trump presidency ends. Not with a whimper, but with a bang. For weeks, Donald Trump had been pointing to 6 January as a day of reckoning. It was when he told his supporters to come to Washington DC, and challenge Congress - and Vice-President Mike Pence - to discard the results of November's election and keep the presidency in his hands. On Wednesday morning, the president and his warm-up speakers set the whirlwind in motion. Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer, said the election disputes should be resolved through ""trial by combat"". Donald Trump Jr, the president's oldest son, had a message to members of his party who would not ""fight"" for their president. ""This isn't their Republican Party anymore,"" he said. ""This is Donald Trump's Republican Party."" Latest updates and reaction Biden blasts 'siege' at Capitol Then the president himself encouraged the growing crowd, which had chanted ""stop the steal"" and ""bullshit"" at the president's prompting, to march the two miles from the White House to the Capitol. ""We will never give up. We will never concede,"" the president said. ""Our country has had enough. We will not take it anymore."" As the president was concluding his remarks, a different kind of drama was playing out within the Capitol itself, as a joint session of Congress prepared to tabulate the state-by-state results of the election. First, Pence - disregarding the president's urging to throw out the results from contested states - released a statement that he did not have such powers and his role was ""largely ceremonial"". Then Republicans issued their first challenge, to Arizona votes, and the House and Senate began their separate deliberations on whether to accept Joe Biden's victory there. The House proceedings were raucous, with both sides cheering as their speakers made their remarks. ""The oath that I took this past Sunday to defend and support the Constitution makes it necessary for me to object to this travesty,"" said newly elected Congresswoman Lauren Boebert, who had recently made headlines for insisting that she would carry a handgun with her in Congress. ""I will not allow the people to be ignored."" Protesters gathered outside the Capitol as the joint session started In the Senate, the debate was taking on a different tone. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, dressed in the kind of dark suit and tie that befits a funeral, was coming to bury Donald Trump, not praise him. ""If this election were overturned by mere allegations from the losing side, our democracy would enter a death spiral,"" McConnell said. ""We'd never see the whole nation accept an election again. Every four years would be a scramble for power at any cost."" The Kentucky senator, who will become the Senate minority leader as a result of his party's two recent defeats in Georgia, said that the chamber was designed to ""stop short-term passions from boiling over and melting the foundations of our republic"". His words were practically still hanging in the air when the passions outside the Capitol boiled over, and the Trump supporters, perhaps inspired by the earlier speeches, stormed the building. They swamped the insufficient security in place and brought the proceedings to a grinding halt, as lawmakers, staff and media rushed to find shelter from the rioters. This video can not be played How a Trump rally near the White House turned deadly at the Capitol The drama unfolded in fits and starts. Television cameras broadcast images of protesters dancing and waving flags on the steps of the Capitol. Photos and snippets popped up on social media of rioters inside the building, attempting to break into the legislative chambers and posing in the offices of elected legislators; of security officers, guns drawn in the House of Representatives, behind barricaded doors. In Wilmington, Delaware, President-elect Joe Biden scrapped a planned speech on the economy and condemned what he called an ""insurrection"" in Washington. ""At this hour our democracy is under unprecedented assault unlike anything we've seen in modern times,"" he said. ""An assault on the citadel of liberty, the Capitol itself."" He concluded his short remarks with a challenge to Trump: to go on national television to condemn the violence and ""demand an end to this siege"". This video can not be played Joe Biden: The scenes of chaos at the Capitol do not reflect a true America, do not represent who we are Minutes later, Trump would offer his message to the nation - but it was not the one Biden suggested. Instead, sandwiched between his now familiar complaints about the election being ""stolen"", he told his supporters ""to go home, we love you, you're very special"". It was the kind of kid gloves way the president has routinely responded to transgressions from his supporters - whether it was their violent treatment of protesters at his rallies, the ""very fine people on both sides"" statement after the clashes at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville or his ""stand back and stand by"" message to the far-right Proud Boys group during the first debate with Biden. Trump's tweet, and two subsequent ones which also praised his supporters, were flagged and then removed by Twitter, whichtook the unprecedented step of locking the president's account for 12 hours. Facebook followed suit, banning Trump for a full day. For the first time in his presidency, for the first time in his long, intimate relationship with social media, Donald Trump had been silenced. If this is the ""at long last, have you left no sense of decency"" moment for Donald Trump, it arrives as they're cleaning up blood and broken glass in the US Capitol. As the afternoon stretched into the evening, and police finally secured the US Capitol, a growing chorus of voices - from the left and right - condemned the violence. It was not surprising that Democrats, like soon-to-be Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, laid the riots at the feet of the president. ""January 6 will go down as one of the darkest days in American history,"" he said. ""A final warning to our nation of the consequences of the demagogic president, the people who enable him, the captive media that parrot his lies and the people who follow him as he attempts to push America to the brink of ruin."" More noteworthy, however, were the Republicans who followed suit. ""We just had a violent mob assault the Capitol in an attempt to prevent those from carrying out our Constitutional duty,"" tweeted Congresswoman Lynne Cheney, a frequent Republican critic of the president's. ""There is no question that the president formed the mob, the president incited the mob, the president addressed the mob."" The condemnations were not limited to Trump's reliable intraparty critics, however. Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, who frequently sides with the president, also spoke out. ""It's past time for the president to accept the results of the election, quit misleading the American people, and repudiate mob violence,"" he said. First Lady Melania Trump's Chief of Staff Stephanie Grisham and Deputy White House Press Secretary Sarah Matthews both resigned in protest, and there are reports that more administration officials will head for the exits in the next 24 hours. CBS has reported that Trump administration Cabinet officials are discussing the 25th amendment to the US constitution, which outlines how the vice-president and a majority of the Cabinet can temporarily remove a president from office. Whether Pence and the Cabinet act or not, Trump's presidency will be over in just two weeks. At that point, Republican Party leaders will have to grapple with a future where it has lost control of the Congress and the White House and has a former president whose reputation is badly tarnished but who still has strong sway over a sizeable segment of the party's base. This video can not be played Mitt Romney warns fellow Republicans not to be complicit in attack on democracy Wednesday's events could presage a pitched battle for the direction of the party, as conservatives within the party attempt to wrest control away from Trump and his loyalists. McConnell, given his remarks earlier in the day, appears willing to chart such a course. Others, like Utah Senator Mitt Romney, a former Republican presidential nominee, may also take a leading role. They will be challenged by others within the party who may be more interested in laying claim to Trump's populist mantle. It was notable that Josh Hawley of Missouri, the first senator to announce he would object the results of the election in the Senate, did not step away from his challenge even after the Senate reconvened following the violence in the Capitol. Crisis can bring political opportunity, and there are many politicians who will not hesitate to use it to gain advantage. Meanwhile, Trump - for now - is still in power. And while he may be chastened, he may be sitting in the White House residence watching television temporarily without his social media outlet, he will not be silent for long. And once he decamps for his new Florida home, he could begin making plans to settle scores and, perhaps, someday return to power and rebuild a legacy that, for the moment, lies in tatters.

"Lockdowns have worked before, but can we expect the new one to do the same? It feels like we are back in March or April last year, when the strict controls on all our lives led to a fairly quick decline in levels of coronavirus. But one of the crucial differences this time is the new variant, which is thought to spread between 50 and 70% faster than previous forms of the virus. Experts warn there are now no guarantees that lockdown will be enough to bring the variant under control. ""It still would not have been easy, but it would have been a much easier situation if it had not been for the new variant,"" Prof Neil Ferguson, from Imperial College London, told Inside Health. ""That really pushes the bounds of our ability to control the spread of the virus, even with measures that were previously relatively quite effective."" Listen: Prof Neil Ferguson on BBC Radio 4's Inside Health What are England's new lockdown rules? New coronavirus variant: What do we know? The coronavirus spreads when we come into contact with each other so moving classrooms online, telling people to stay at home and closing shops breaks many of those opportunities for human contact. If we consider the R number - the average number of people each infected person passes the virus on to - it was about 3.0 in the run up to the first lockdown and anything above 1.0 means cases are climbing. What is the R number? R fell to 0.6 during the first lockdown. Then every 1,000 infected people passed the virus on to 600 others, who passed it on to 360 others and so on. But if the new variant is 50% more transmissible then the R number, in the same lockdown conditions, would be about 0.9. Then 1,000 infected people would pass the virus onto 900 others, then 810 and so on. As you can see this leads to far slower decline. And that assumes lockdown can get R down to 0.9 in areas where the new variant has become the most common form of the virus. If, as some studies suggest, the variant is about 70% more transmissible then R may stay above 1.0 and cases may not fall at all. ""We'd at best flatten the curve, keep numbers at a roughly constant level, and that's frankly why there is so much emphasis on getting vaccine into people's arms as quickly as possible,"" said Prof Ferguson. It is hard to lock down even harder as there are some parts of society - hospitals, supermarkets - that need to be kept open. What happens to the number of cases over the coming weeks will be closely monitored. If this lockdown is less effective then we will have to live with it for longer. There have been some encouraging signs over the Christmas break, which was a bit like a lockdown due to school holidays and other restrictions. ""We are in a very difficult situation here, but my initial assessment of the last few days is that the rate is slowing which is good news,"" Prof John Edmunds, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told the BBC. He added: ""It looks likes those restrictions should be sufficient to stop the increase, whether they will be sufficient to bring cases down sufficiently we are yet to see."" Eventually the vaccine will give people immunity so we do not need the same controls on our lives. Now more than ever this is a race between the virus and the vaccine.

"Jamie Stiehm is a US political columnist who was in the Capitol building in Washington DC  when it was stormed by pro-Trump rioters. Here's what she saw from the press gallery in the House of Representatives. I had told my sister earlier: ""Something bad is going to happen today. I don't know what, but something bad will happen."" Outside the Capitol, I encountered a group of very boisterous supporters of President Donald Trump, all waving flags and pledging their allegiance to him. There was a sense that trouble was brewing. I went inside to the House of Representatives and up into the press gallery, where we were assigned seats, looking down at the rather sombre gathering. Speaker Nancy Pelosi was holding the gavel, and keeping people to their five-minute statements. In pictures: Pro-Trump protesters storm Capitol What does a deadly day means for Trump's legacy? As we went into the second hour, all of a sudden we heard breaking glass. The air began getting fogged. An announcement from the Capitol Police said, ""An individual has breached the building"". So everyone looked around and then it was business as usual. But after that, the announcements kept coming. And they were getting more and more urgent. They announced that the intruders had breached the rotunda, which is under the famed marble dome. The sacred house of democracy was under fire. Jamie Stiehm is a US political columnist Many of us are hardened journalists - I've seen my share of violence covering homicides in Baltimore - but this was very unpredictable. The police didn't seem to know what was happening. They weren't coordinated. They locked the chamber doors but at the same time, they told us we would have to evacuate. So there was a sense of panic. I was afraid. I'll tell you that. And I've spoken to other journalists who said they were a little ashamed of themselves for feeling afraid. There was a sense of ""nobody's in charge here, the Capitol Police have lost control of the building, anything can happen"". If you think back to the September 11 attacks in 2001, there was one plane that went down and didn't hit its target. That target was the Capitol. There were echoes of that. I made a call to my family, just to let them know that I was here and it was a dangerous situation. There was a shot. We could see there was a standoff in our chamber. Five men were holding guns at the door. It was a frightening sight. Men were looking through a broken glass window and looked like they could shoot at any second. Thankfully there was no gunfire inside the chamber. But for a while there, it felt like it would be a real possibility. Because things were going downhill very fast. We had to crawl under railings to get out of the way. I was not dressed to do that. A lot of women were dressed up, wearing heels, because they had come for a formal ritual. I sheltered in the House cafeteria alongside others. I'm still shaking now. I have seen a lot as a journalist, but this was something more. This was the collective public sphere being undermined, assaulted, degraded. And I think this was why the Speaker wanted to return and hold the gavel again and go on. Afterwards I had to decide whether I was going to go back to the chamber too. I decided l probably would, because the message that is sending is: ""You can incite a mob, but we're going to go on"". I think that is a very important political message. As told to Jessica Lussenhop. This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.

"The coronavirus vaccine rollout is a national challenge requiring an unprecedented effort - involving the armed forces - Boris Johnson says. The PM confirmed almost 1.5 million people in the UK have now received at least one dose of a Covid vaccine. More than 1,000 GP-led sites in England will be able to offer a total of ""hundreds of thousands"" of jabs each day by 15 January, he said. The Army will use ""battle preparation techniques"" to help achieve that goal. It came as a further 1,162 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported on Thursday - the second consecutive day of more than 1,000 recorded fatalities - and 52,618 new cases. And as Simon Stevens, head of the NHS in England, warned 10,000 patients with Covid had been admitted to hospital since Christmas Day. Can we really jab our way out of lockdown? How busy are hospitals in England? New travel curbs to stop South Africa variant Speaking at a Downing Street news conference, Mr Johnson said there would likely be ""lumpiness and bumpiness"" in the rollout of vaccines. He said: ""Let's be clear, this is a national challenge on a scale like nothing we've seen before and it will require an unprecedented national effort. ""Of course, there will be difficulties, appointments will be changed but... the Army is working hand in glove with the NHS and local councils to set up our vaccine network and using battle preparation techniques to help us keep up the pace."" Alongside GPs, there will be 223 hospital sites andseven ""giant vaccination centres""- as well as an initial 200 community pharmacies - offering jabs, Mr Johnson said. Everyone will have a vaccination centre within 10 miles of their home, he added, with a ""full vaccination deployment plan"" to be published on Monday. He also said there would be a national booking system for vaccinations - but did not give any more details. This video can not be played Brigadier Phil Prosser said his task was to ensure everyone in England had equal access to the vaccine Brigadier Phil Prosser, commander of military support to the vaccine delivery programme, told the news conference his team was ""embedded"" with the NHS. He said his ""day job"" is to deliver combat supplies to UK forces in time of war, ""at speed in the most arduous and challenging conditions"". The government has set a target to offer vaccination slots to 15 millionin the top four priority groups- including all over-80s - by 15 February. And Mr Johnson said that, with the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine available, he could pledge one of those groups - care home residents - would all receive their jab by the end of January. The widespread rollout of the vaccine has begun in earnest with the first doses delivered during the day to family doctors for distribution. But therewere concerns from some GPs over supplies, as Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the levels of vaccine supply was the ""rate-limiting"" factor as jabs would be delivered as quickly as stock is available. It comes as some hospitals in England areat risk of becoming Covid-only sites, with rising admissions for the virus forcing trusts to cut back on other services. The latest NHS statistics also show that there were 30,370 patients with Covid in UK hospitals on Tuesday, a much higher figure than the first peak in the spring of 2020. Hospital leaders have warned medics are becoming increasingly stretched with ""untrained staff"" used to fill gaps. At 20:00 GMT, people in some streets stepped out onto doorsteps to clap for the heroes of the pandemic, following a weekly initiative which gained popularity during the UK's first lockdown. However, Thursday's clap for heroes was more muted than those seen last year, perhaps reflecting criticism the initiativehad become politicised. Lots of detail has been given about how the NHS - working hand-in-hand with the military - will be able to deliver the vaccines. There will be more local vaccination centres, hospital hubs and even mass vaccination at sports stadiums. Thousands of extra vaccinators have already been trained - and thousands more are waiting in the wings. But the biggest hurdle the UK faces is vaccine supply. If it is not available, it cannot be put in arms no matter how good the vaccination network is. In the long-term, supply is not likely to be a problem - but in the coming weeks it could be tight. There is enough vaccine in the country to offer all those at highest risk a jab by mid-February. But it is not yet all ready for the NHS to use, either because the final safety checks have not been done or the vaccine has not been put into vials. The former depends on lab work by the medicines regulator, while the latter is the job of a plant in Wrexham. Each stage takes some time. The target is achievable, but a lot has to go right. Sir Simon Stevens said there were 50% more coronavirus patients in England's hospitals now compared to the peak last April, affecting every region across the country. He said: ""That number is accelerating very, very rapidly... the pressures are real and they are growing."" In Northern Ireland, the Belfast Health Trust has said it has no other option but to cancel all of its urgent cancer surgeryamid ""highly significant"" demand for bed space. The cancelled operations will affect those patients for whom surgery could impact recovery and even survival, the trust said. Boris Johnson said all parts of government would be throwing everything at the vaccination effort ""round the clock"" In one positive development for hospitals,two more life-saving drugs that can cut deaths by a quarterin patients who are sickest with Covid have been cleared for widespread use, with immediate effect. The anti-inflammatory medications, given via a drip, save an extra life for every 12 treated, researchers said, following NHS trials. Elsewhere, the UK has implemented restrictions on travellers to England from countries near South Africato stop the spread of the South African Covid variant. Meanwhile, Mr Johnson and Sir Simon were asked about persistent social media claims that coronavirus does not exist - and that reports of packed hospital wards of people being treated are just a myth. Sir Simon said that such misinformation was an ""insult"" to hard-working critical care staff. ""There is nothing more demoralising than having that kind of nonsense spouted when it is most obviously untrue,"" he said.

"GPs in England are receiving doses of the Oxford Covid jab as medics warn about overstretched hospitals. The rollout of the Oxford vaccine is part of the NHS's biggest-ever effort and aims to offer jabs to 13 million by mid-February - including all over-80s. But Health Secretary Matt Hancock admitted vaccine supply was a ""rate-limiting"" factor. Birmingham's NHS said there are enough supplies with more to come as politicians warned doses may run out. Some hospitals in England areat risk of becoming Covid-only sites, with rising admissions for the virus forcing trusts to cut back on other services.

The latest NHS statistics also show that there were 30,370 patients with Covid in UK hospitals on Tuesday. The rollout of the Oxford vaccine to GPs will help increase vaccinations among thetop four priority groupswho are first in line to receive doses. The Department of Health said 1.3 million people in the UK, including almost a quarter of those aged over 80 in England, have received at least one dose so far. 1.3 million in UK have had their Covid vaccine Can we really jab our way out of lockdown? What are the UK's new lockdown rules? How busy are hospitals in England? Writing to Health Secretary Matt Hancock, the Birmingham political leaders criticised communication around the vaccination programme in the city. ""We acknowledge that the vaccination rollout is in its early days, but we have also learned today that Birmingham has not yet been supplied with any AstraZeneca stock, while current Pfizer stocks are scheduled to run out on Friday this week with currently no clarity on when further supplies will arrive."" They added ""it remains unclear who is responsible for overseeing the vaccination programme in Birmingham, and whom we should hold accountable for progress and delivery"". The letter is signed by Labour leader of Birmingham City Council, Ian Ward; Liam Byrne MP, Labour's candidate for the West Midlands mayor, and by Conservative MP and ex-minister Andrew Mitchell.

But NHS Birmingham and Solihull told the BBC: ""Thousands of people in Birmingham and Solihull have already been vaccinated and this continues at pace. ""We have sufficient supplies and more will be coming."" West Midlands mayor Andy Street said he has been assured supplies of the Oxford vaccine will be delivered to Birmingham on Friday. Elsewhere, Gillian McLauchlan, deputy director of public health at Salford Council, described ""teething"" issues with the vaccine rollout there. She told councillors at a local scrutiny committee: ""We have no control over vaccine supplies. We are told literally two days in advance 'your next lot of vaccines are coming'."" England's vaccination programme is described as the biggest in NHS history, with an aim to offer jabs to most care home residents by the end of January and the most vulnerable by mid-February. Officials leading the vaccination programme are adamant rollout is going to plan - and are cautioning against judging performance too early. Of course, there will be teething problems, but the fact remains the UK has vaccinated more per head of population than any other country apart from Israel and Bahrain. While rollout of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine started on Monday, it was actually only being used at the hospital hubs up to Thursday. Deliveries are now being made to hundreds of local vaccination centres. There are 17 in the Birmingham region so they should start to receive doses imminently. That should mean there is a vaccine available if they do run out of the Pfizer-BioNTech jab. Although disruption to the rollout of the programme in the city may still happen as local centres are warning they cannot book patients in until they know they have stock available. But the fact the city's leaders felt compelled to write to the health secretary to warn about this is an illustration of the pressure in the system at the moment. Given the high level of infections and current lockdown, there is a desperation in all quarters to get the most at-risk vaccinated as quickly as possible. And until the nation sees that translate into significant numbers of people getting vaccinated - 2 million a week is the goal - people will remain on edge. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was approved for emergency use on 2 December but requires specialist storage unsuitable for most GP practices, with doses largely delivered in hospitals. The Oxford-AstraZeneca jab was approved on 30 December and does not require specialist storage. It was first rolled out on Monday to hospitals and to GPs in England from Thursday. This video can not be played One medical centre in London is now vaccinating almost 1,000 people a week Mr Hancock visited a GP surgery in London to promote the roll out earlier - but staff there said delivery of the Oxford vaccine had been delayed. The health secretary said he was ""delighted"" care home residents would begin receiving their first Oxford jabs from GPs this week. ""This will ensure the most vulnerable are protected and will save tens of thousands of lives,"" he said. GP Ammara Hughes, a partner at Bloomsbury Surgery, told broadcasters its first delivery of the Oxford jab had been pushed back 24 hours to Thursday. She said: ""It's just more frustrating than a concern because we've got the capacity to vaccinate. And if we had a regular supply - we do have the capacity to vaccinate three to four thousand patients a week."" Mr Hancock described supply of vaccine as a ""rate-limiting"" step. He said: ""For the first three days with the Oxford vaccine we did it in hospitals to check that it was working well and it's working well so now we can make sure that it gets to all those GP surgeries that like this one can do all the vaccinations that are needed. ""The rate-limiting step is the supply of vaccine. We're working with the companies - both Pfizer and AstraZeneca - to increase the supply."" More than 700 local vaccination sites will administer jabs, with the government announcinga further seven mass vaccination sites across England. Another 180 GP-led sites, 100 new hospital sites and a pilot scheme involving local pharmacies will open this week. Meanwhile, nearly 19,981 second doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech jab - which was the first to be approved for emergency use in the UK last month - were administered between 29 December and 3 January, NHS England said. It came as Rupert Pearse, professor of intensive care medicine and a consultant at the Royal London, said his own intensive care staff are having to care for far more sick patients. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there would usually be a ratio of one fully-trained intensive care nurse for each patient in a unit but staff are becoming increasingly stretched. ""Right now we are diluting down to one [intensive care] nurse to three [patients] and filling those gaps with untrained staff and in some instances doctors helping nurses deliver their care... and we're even facing diluting that further to one in four,"" he said. All of the UK is now under strict virus curbs, with Wales, Northern Ireland and most of Scotland also in lockdown, and vaccinations are progressing across the devolved nations.

"This video can not be played Priti Patel says Donald Trump was wrong for not condemning the violence Donald Trump's comments ""directly led"" to his supporters storming Congress and clashing with police, Home Secretary Priti Patel has said. Four people have diedafter a pro-Trump mob stormed the building in a bid to overturn the election result. President Trump had urged protesters to march on the Capitol after making false claims of electoral fraud. Ms Patel said the president's words had fuelled the violence and he ""didn't do anything to de-escalate that"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson hascondemned the ""disgraceful scenes""and called for a ""peaceful and orderly transfer of power"". On Wednesday evening, President Trump later called on his supporters to ""go home"", while continuing to make false claims of electoral fraud. Hehas been suspendedfrom his Facebook and Instagram accounts for at least two weeks, and possibly indefinitely. Twitter has also frozen his account. The president has now said there will be an ""orderly transition"" to Democrat Joe Biden, whose November election victoryhas now been certifiedby US lawmakers. But he added that he continued to ""totally disagree"" with the outcome of the vote, repeating his unsubstantiated claims of electoral fraud. Hundreds of the president's supporters stormed the Capitol - where lawmakers were meeting to confirm Mr Biden's election victory - and staged an occupation of the building in Washington DC. Both chambers of Congress were forced into recess, as protesters clashed with police and tear gas was released. Ms Patel told BBC Breakfast the scenes were ""awful beyond words"". The home secretary said: ""His comments directly led to the violence, and so far he has failed to condemn that violence and that is completely wrong.""

Friend of President Trump and leader of Reform UK - formerly the Brexit Party - Nigel Farage tweeted: ""Storming Capitol Hill is wrong. The protesters must leave."" Meanwhile, Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey has defended the prime minister's response to the rioting. Asked on ITV's Peston programme why Mr Johnson hadn't criticised Mr Trump, she said: ""The prime minister has been clear tonight that we need a peaceful and orderly transition."" Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle has written to express his ""solidarity"" with US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, whose empty office was broken into by protesters. ""Seeing your office trashed in that way and its occupation by one of the rioters was particularly outrageous. I am just so relieved you were not hurt,"" he wrote. Trump supporters left this note on the desk of Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the House of Representatives. It is a truism of British diplomacy that every occupant of 10 Downing Street has to get on with every occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, regardless of their politics or character. Personal consideration is pushed aside. What matters is the national interest and staying close to one of Britain's closest allies. Thus even now, even after Donald Trump's incitement of the Capitol mob, even though there are less than two weeks until the inauguration, even as close Republican allies jump ship, Boris Johnson and Dominic Raab were reluctant to criticise the president by name in their initial response overnight. Yes, they condemned the violence. But of Mr Trump, not a word. This caution was matched by the Prime Ministers of fellow so-called Five Eyes intelligence allies, Australia and New Zealand, both of whom also both failed to mention Mr Trump in their condemnatory tweets. In contrast, European leaders were quick to blame the president personally. It was only this morning that a British minister, Home Secretary Priti Patel, felt able to follow suit in strong terms. So was this natural and sensible diplomatic caution in the midst of a febrile crisis? Or was this, as some Labour figures are already claiming, a function of the closeness between the current UK government and the Trump administration? It was only a few weeks ago thatDefence Secretary Ben Wallace told The Sun,externalthat he would miss Donald Trump because he was a good friend to Britain. Whatever one's views, it is certainly the case that the British government is seen on the international stage by some has having ideological proximity to Mr Trump. Changing that reputation is seen by many diplomats as a priority in the months ahead, a task made more urgent by events overnight.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""I condemn encouraging people to behave in the disgraceful way they did in the Capitol"" Donald Trump was ""completely wrong"" to cast doubt on the US election and encourage supporters to storm the Capitol, Boris Johnson has said. The UK prime minister said he ""unreservedly condemns"" the US president's actions. Four people diedafter a pro-Trump mob stormed the building in a bid to overturn the election result. Mr Trump had urged protesters to march on the Capitol after making false electoral fraud claims. He later called on his supporters to ""go home"", while continuing to make false claims -Twitter and Facebook later froze his accounts. The president has now said there will be an ""orderly transition"" to President-elect Joe Biden, whose November election victoryhas now been certifiedby US lawmakers.

But asked by the BBC's political correspondent Alex Forsyth if President Trump was directly responsible, he said: ""All my life America has stood for some very important things. An idea of freedom, an idea of democracy. ""As you say, in so far as he encouraged people to storm the Capitol, and in so far as the president has consistently cast doubt on the outcome of a free and fair election, I believe that was completely wrong. ""I believe what President Trump has been saying about that has been completely wrong and I unreservedly condemn encouraging people to behave in the disgraceful way that they did in the Capitol.""

A woman died after being shot by police, and three others died as a result of ""medical emergencies"", local police said. UK politicians from different parties have all condemned Mr Trump's actions in encouraging the storming of the Capitol. Earlier, Home Secretary Priti Patel said the president's comments had ""directly led"" to the events and he ""didn't do anything to de-escalate that"".

"Sarah Bingham said she is a match donor for her daughter Ariel and eldest son Noah (far right) A mother with two children who need kidney transplants said she wishes she could help both of them, but can only donate one organ. Sarah Bingham's son Noah, 20, and daughter Ariel, 16, have the same rare genetic condition. Mrs Bingham, 48, is a donor match for her children and said her maternal instinct is to donate to both of them. But her organ was always due to go to her daughter and two family friends are matches for her son. Her husband Darryl, 49, is not a match, so cannot be a donor for their children. Both Noah and Ariel have nephronophthisis, which causes inflammation and scarring to the kidneys. Mrs Bingham, of Hexham, Northumberland, said although her son is ""very poorly"", he undergoes regular dialysis and is in a stable condition. Her daughter's kidney function ""has been deteriorating more in the last year"" and she will probably need a transplant first. Mrs Bingham said: ""I was all set to give a kidney to my daughter and then my son went into renal failure and he also needs a kidney. Obviously, I've only got one that I can donate. ""The renal teams don't push you [to make a decision], because you're putting yourself on the line to donate a kidney. ""You have to make that call yourself, but obviously as a mum when you've got two children who both need kidney transplants and you've expected to give your kidney to one, and suddenly the other one needs one as well, you feel this dilemma."" Noah Bingham is in a stable condition thanks to regular kidney dialysis Problems began in 2016 when Ariel started to feel constantly tired. Her fatigue was initially put down to exam stress, but tests at Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary found she had the kidney condition. Mrs Bingham was told she would be a suitable donor for Ariel when the time came. Then, in 2019, Noah became ill and was diagnosed with the same condition. He is stable, but would need to put on weight to undergo a transplant. The couple have another son Casper, 12, who is being tested to see if he also has the condition. Darryl Bingham is not a suitable match for his two eldest children Prof John Sayer, a kidney specialist at Newcastle's Freeman Hospital who is treating Noah, said nephronophthisis affects about one in 100,000 people. ""There's clearly a dilemma because there's a shortage of donors for patients needing kidney transplants. ""But kidney failure itself is not rare. There are 4,500 people across the country waiting for a transplant."" He added patients often face a ""gruelling and terrifying"" wait of about three years for a donor organ.

"President-elect Joe Biden called the riot an ""insurrection"" Images of rioters storming the US Capitol in a bid to overturn the result of a democratic election have sent shockwaves around the world. Four people died during the attack, launched by supporters of President Trump after he addressed a rally in Washington. President-elect Joe Biden called it an ""insurrection"", while Vice-President Mike Pence said the violence had been a ""dark day in the history of the United States Capitol"". But this is not the first time the building - regarded as the symbolic heart of US democracy - has been hit by violence. From bombs to foreign invasions, here are four other times the Capitol was attacked. Follow our live updates What does a deadly day mean for Trump's legacy? In pictures: Pro-Trump protesters storm Capitol 'They tried to break in - then I heard a shot' Perhaps the most famous attack was by British forces during the War of 1812. British troops, led by Vice Admiral Sir Alexander Cockburn and Major General Robert Ross - set fire to the still-under-construction Capitol after invading Washington DC in August 1814 (though the building survived thanks to a downpour). The ruins of the Capitol following the British attack In retaliation for the Americans' burning of Upper Canada's capital at York a year earlier, the British troops also set fire to other parts of the city and key buildings, including the White House. The 1814 attack marks the only time that a foreign power has captured and occupied Washington. In 2014, the British embassy in Washingtonapologised after tweeting a picture of a White House cakesurrounded by sparklers, ""commemorating"" the burning of the building 200 years before. A century on from the British attack, Erich Muenter, former professor of German at Harvard University, exploded three sticks of dynamite in the Senate reception room. The explosion damaged the building, but nobody was killed. Muenter later said the attack was in response to American financiers aiding Britain against Germany in World War I. This video can not be played When a mob stormed the US capitol Writing under a pseudonym in the Washington Evening Star, Muenter said he hoped the attack would ""make enough noise to be heard above the voices that clamour for war"", adding: ""This explosion is an exclamation point in my appeal for peace."" A day after the attack, Muenter shot and injured financier JP Morgan Jr, before being subdued by Morgan's butler and arrested. He later took his own life. On 1 March 1954, four Puerto Rican nationalists pulled out the island's flag and shouted ""Freedom for Puerto Rico"" as they opened fire from the visitors' gallery of the House of Representatives, injuring five congressmen. ""I did not come to kill anyone, I came to die for Puerto Rico!"" cried the leader, Lolita Lebron, during her arrest. 'I came to die for Puerto Rico!' cried Lolita Lebron, left Lebron was sentenced to 50 years behind bars, while the three men were given 75 years. The sentences were all later commuted by President Jimmy Carter. His administration said the release ""would be a significant humanitarian gesture and would be viewed as such by much of the international community"". The group returned to cheering crowds in Puerto Rico. On 7 November 1983, an explosion ripped through the second floor of the Senate. Just minutes before the explosion, someone claiming to be from a group named the Armed Resistance Unit called a Capitol switchboard warning of a pending attack, saying it was in retaliation for US military actions in Grenada and Lebanon. Police cars outside the Capitol after the 1983 attack There were no casualties but there was some costly damage. In 1988, FBI agents arrested seven members of the radical-left Resistance Conspiracy group for the Capitol attack and separate blasts at Fort McNair and the Washington Navy Yard in 1983 and 1984. Linda Evans and Laura Whitehorn were jailed for conspiracy and malicious destruction of government property in 1991. Both are now free. How a Trump rally turned deadly at the Capitol.

"Who were the protesters that broke into buildings on Capitol Hill after attending a rally in support of Donald Trump? Some were carrying symbols and flags strongly associated with particular ideas and factions, but in practice many of the members and their causes overlap. Images show individuals associated with a range of extreme and far-right groups and supporters of fringe online conspiracy theories, many of whom have long been active online and at pro-Trump rallies. One of the most startling images, quickly shared across social media, shows a man dressed with a painted face, fur hat and horns, holding an American flag. He's been identified as Jake Angeli, a well-known supporter of thebaseless conspiracy theory QAnon. He calls himself the QAnon Shaman. His social media presence shows him attending multiple QAnon events and posting YouTube videos about deep state conspiracies. He was pictured in November making a speech in Phoenix, Arizona, about unproven claims the election was fraudulent. His personal Facebook page is filled with images and memes relating to all sorts of extreme ideas and conspiracy theories. This video can not be played Phone footage reveals chaotic scenes inside US Capitol Another group spotted at the storming of the Capitol were members of thefar-right group Proud Boys. The organisation was founded in 2016 and is anti-immigrant and all male. In the first US presidential debate President Trump in response to a question about white supremacists and militias said: ""Proud Boys - stand back and stand by."" The individual on the right is Nick Ochs, who describes himself as a ""Proud Boy Elder"". One of their members, Nick Ochs, tweeted a selfie inside the building saying ""Hello from the Capital lol"". He also filmed a live stream inside. We haven't identified the individual standing on the left in the above image. Mr Ochs' profile on the messaging app Telegram describes himself as a ""Proud Boy Elder from Hawaii."" Individuals with large followings online were also spotted at the protests. Among them was the social media personality Tim Gionet, who goes under the pseudonym ""Baked Alaska"". Tim Gionet, better known as ""Baked Alaska"", livestreamed himself from the Capitol on Wednesday His livestream from inside the Capitol posted on a niche streaming service was watched by thousands of people and showed him talking to other protesters. A Trump supporter, Mr Gionet has made a name for himself as an internet troll. He's been described by theSouthern Poverty Law Centre, a US nonprofit legal advocacy group,,externalas a ""white nationalist"",a label he disputed in a comment to The Insider,external. YouTube banned his channel in October after he posted videos of himself harassing shop workers and refusing to wear a face-mask during the coronavirus pandemic. Other platforms that have previously shut down his accounts include Twitter and PayPal. This video can not be played 'Treason, traitors and thugs'  - the words lawmakers used to describe Capitol riot A photo that went viral of a man who'd entered the office of senior Democrat politician Nancy Pelosi has been named as Richard Barnett from Arkansas. Richard Barnett left a message for US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi saying ""we will not back down"" Outside Capitol Hill buildings, he told the New York Times that he took an envelope from the speaker's office and says left a note calling her an expletive.

Reacting to the New York Times interview, Republican congressman Steve Womack said on Twitter: ""I'm sickened to learn that the below actions were perpetrated by a constituent."" Local media reports say Mr Barnett is involved in a group that supports gun rights, and that he was interviewed at a 'Stop the Steal' rally following the presidential election - a movement that refused to accept Joe Biden's victory and supports the president's unsubstantiated claims of electoral fraud. In the interview at the rally organised by 'Engaged Patriots' he said: ""If you don't like it, send somebody out to get me 'cause I ain't going down easy."" The group associated with Mr Barnett held a fundraiser in October with proceeds going towards body cameras for the local police department, according to the Westside Eagle Observer local paper. As the events were unfolding, many social media users, especially those associated with QAnon and supporters of President Trump, were claiming that agitators fromthe loose-knit left-wing group antifawere involved. The implication was that these activists were disguised as Trump supporters to create disruption. A number of prominent Republican politicians, such as US Representative Matt Gaetz, claimed it was antifa masquerading as Trump supporters. One widely-shared post claimed one protester had a ""communist hammer"" tattoo, as evidence that he wasn't a Trump supporter. On closer inspection, the symbol is from the video game series Dishonored. There have also been suggestions that Mr Angeli, the man wearing fur and horns, was a Black Lives Matter supporter, with users sharing an image of him at a BLM event in Arizona. Mr Angeli was indeed at that event, but he was there as a counter-protester. In images taken there, he's seen holding a QAnon sign. At least one of the rioters was holding a Confederate flag, which represented US states that supported the continuation of slavery during the American civil war. For this reason, it is considered by many to be a symbol of racism and there have been calls to ban it across the US. Others see it as an important part of southern US history. A protester carries the Confederate flag after breaching US Capitol security In July it was announcedthat the flag could no longer be flown on American military propertiesbecause of a new policy to reject ""divisive symbols"". President Trump has defended the use of the Confederate flag in the past, saying: ""I know people that like the Confederate flag and they're not thinking about slavery...I just think it's freedom of speech."" There were also protesters holding aloft flags featuring a coiled rattlesnake on a yellow background, often accompanied by the phrase ""don't tread on me"". This is known as the Gadsden flag, harking back to the American revolution and the war to expel British colonialists. It was adopted by libertarians in the 1970s,according to an article in the New Yorker,external, and more recently became a favourite symbol of conservative Tea Party activists. The flag has been adopted by the right over the past couple of decades, says Prof Margaret Weir, a political science expert at Brown University. It is also used by anti-government, white supremacist groups who embrace violence, she says. Reporting by Jack Goodman, Christopher Giles, Olga Robinson and Shayan Sardarizadeh.

"The coronavirus vaccine rollout is a national challenge requiring an unprecedented effort - involving the armed forces - Boris Johnson says. The PM confirmed almost 1.5 million people in the UK have now received at least one dose of a Covid vaccine. More than 1,000 GP-led sites in England will be able to offer a total of ""hundreds of thousands"" of jabs each day by 15 January, he said. The Army will use ""battle preparation techniques"" to help achieve that goal. It came as a further 1,162 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported on Thursday - the second consecutive day of more than 1,000 recorded fatalities - and 52,618 new cases. And as Simon Stevens, head of the NHS in England, warned 10,000 patients with Covid had been admitted to hospital since Christmas Day. Can we really jab our way out of lockdown? How busy are hospitals in England? New travel curbs to stop South Africa variant Speaking at a Downing Street news conference, Mr Johnson said there would likely be ""lumpiness and bumpiness"" in the rollout of vaccines. He said: ""Let's be clear, this is a national challenge on a scale like nothing we've seen before and it will require an unprecedented national effort. ""Of course, there will be difficulties, appointments will be changed but... the Army is working hand in glove with the NHS and local councils to set up our vaccine network and using battle preparation techniques to help us keep up the pace."" Alongside GPs, there will be 223 hospital sites andseven ""giant vaccination centres""- as well as an initial 200 community pharmacies - offering jabs, Mr Johnson said. Everyone will have a vaccination centre within 10 miles of their home, he added, with a ""full vaccination deployment plan"" to be published on Monday. He also said there would be a national booking system for vaccinations - but did not give any more details. This video can not be played Brigadier Phil Prosser said his task was to ensure everyone in England had equal access to the vaccine Brigadier Phil Prosser, commander of military support to the vaccine delivery programme, told the news conference his team was ""embedded"" with the NHS. He said his ""day job"" is to deliver combat supplies to UK forces in time of war, ""at speed in the most arduous and challenging conditions"". The government has set a target to offer vaccination slots to 15 millionin the top four priority groups- including all over-80s - by 15 February. And Mr Johnson said that, with the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine available, he could pledge one of those groups - care home residents - would all receive their jab by the end of January. The widespread rollout of the vaccine has begun in earnest with the first doses delivered during the day to family doctors for distribution. But therewere concerns from some GPs over supplies, as Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the levels of vaccine supply was the ""rate-limiting"" factor as jabs would be delivered as quickly as stock is available. It comes as some hospitals in England areat risk of becoming Covid-only sites, with rising admissions for the virus forcing trusts to cut back on other services. The latest NHS statistics also show that there were 30,370 patients with Covid in UK hospitals on Tuesday, a much higher figure than the first peak in the spring of 2020. Hospital leaders have warned medics are becoming increasingly stretched with ""untrained staff"" used to fill gaps. At 20:00 GMT, people in some streets stepped out onto doorsteps to clap for the heroes of the pandemic, following a weekly initiative which gained popularity during the UK's first lockdown. However, Thursday's clap for heroes was more muted than those seen last year, perhaps reflecting criticism the initiativehad become politicised. Lots of detail has been given about how the NHS - working hand-in-hand with the military - will be able to deliver the vaccines. There will be more local vaccination centres, hospital hubs and even mass vaccination at sports stadiums. Thousands of extra vaccinators have already been trained - and thousands more are waiting in the wings. But the biggest hurdle the UK faces is vaccine supply. If it is not available, it cannot be put in arms no matter how good the vaccination network is. In the long-term, supply is not likely to be a problem - but in the coming weeks it could be tight. There is enough vaccine in the country to offer all those at highest risk a jab by mid-February. But it is not yet all ready for the NHS to use, either because the final safety checks have not been done or the vaccine has not been put into vials. The former depends on lab work by the medicines regulator, while the latter is the job of a plant in Wrexham. Each stage takes some time. The target is achievable, but a lot has to go right. Sir Simon Stevens said there were 50% more coronavirus patients in England's hospitals now compared to the peak last April, affecting every region across the country. He said: ""That number is accelerating very, very rapidly... the pressures are real and they are growing."" In Northern Ireland, the Belfast Health Trust has said it has no other option but to cancel all of its urgent cancer surgeryamid ""highly significant"" demand for bed space. The cancelled operations will affect those patients for whom surgery could impact recovery and even survival, the trust said. Boris Johnson said all parts of government would be throwing everything at the vaccination effort ""round the clock"" In one positive development for hospitals,two more life-saving drugs that can cut deaths by a quarterin patients who are sickest with Covid have been cleared for widespread use, with immediate effect. The anti-inflammatory medications, given via a drip, save an extra life for every 12 treated, researchers said, following NHS trials. Elsewhere, the UK has implemented restrictions on travellers to England from countries near South Africato stop the spread of the South African Covid variant. Meanwhile, Mr Johnson and Sir Simon were asked about persistent social media claims that coronavirus does not exist - and that reports of packed hospital wards of people being treated are just a myth. Sir Simon said that such misinformation was an ""insult"" to hard-working critical care staff. ""There is nothing more demoralising than having that kind of nonsense spouted when it is most obviously untrue,"" he said.

"This video can not be played Trump has tweeted a video finally condemning the Capitol rioters US President Donald Trump has been allowed to Tweet again, after being locked out of his account for 12 hours. Posting a more conciliatory message, he refrained from reiterating false claims of voter fraud. Twitter said that it would ban Mr Trump ""permanently"" if he breached the platform's rules again. The move from Twitter puts clear water between it and Facebook, which suspended him ""indefinitely"" on Thursday. Twitter has instead given the outgoing president a final warning. Earlier on Thursday, the popular gaming platform Twitch also placed an indefinite ban on Mr Trump's channel, which he has used for rally broadcasts. Mr Trump tweeted several message on Wednesday, calling the people who stormed Capitol Hill ""patriots"". He also said ""We love you."" This video can not be played When a mob stormed the US capitol A spokesperson for Twitter said: ""After the Tweets were removed and the subsequent 12-hour period expired, access to @realDonaldTrump was restored. ""Any future violations of the Twitter Rules, including our Civic Integrity or Violent Threats policies, will result in permanent suspension of the @realDonaldTrump account."" Earlier in the day, the president was suspended from Facebook and Instagram. That suspension will be reviewed after the transition of power to Joe Biden on 20 January. The social network had originally imposed a 24-hour ban after the US Capitol attack. Facebook's chief, Mark Zuckerberg, wrote that the risks of allowing Mr Trump to post ""are simply too great"". Mr Zuckerberg said Facebook had removed the president's posts ""because we judged that their effect - and likely their intent - would be to provoke further violence"". Allow Facebook content?

He said it was clear Mr Trump intended to undermine the transfer of power to President-elect Joe Biden. ""Therefore, we are extending the block we have placed on his Facebook and Instagram accounts indefinitely and for at least the next two weeks until the peaceful transition of power is complete,"" he wrote. Mr Trump's favoured platform, Twitter, suspended the president for 12 hours on Wednesday. The company said it required the removal of three tweets for ""severe violations of our Civic Integrity policy"". It said the president's account would remain locked for good if the tweets were not removed. Twitter has now confirmed the offending tweets have been removed, and he is free to tweet again. LIVE: Biden victory confirmed after deadly attack on Capitol Trumpâs Twitter endgame What does a deadly day mean for Trump's legacy? Snapchat also stopped Mr Trump from creating new posts, but did not say if or when it would end the ban. YouTube also removed Wednesday's video. The president's supporters stormed the seat of US governmentand clashed with police, leading to the death of one woman. The violence brought to a halt congressional debate over Democrat Joe Biden's election win. In the House and Senate chambers, Republicans were challenging the certification of November's election results. This video can not be played ""We will never give up, we will never concede"", Trump tells supporters Before the violence, President Trump had told supporters on the National Mall in Washington that the election had been stolen.

"Matthew Mason will be sentenced later this month A man who killed a schoolboy after paying him to stop their sexual relationship being revealed has been found guilty of murder. Matthew Mason admitted bludgeoning 15-year-old Alex Rodda with a wrench in Ashley, Cheshire, in 2019. The 19-year-old paid Alex more than Â£2,000 after he contacted his then girlfriend about ""flirty"" messages, Chester Crown Court heard. Mason, of Ash Lane in Ollerton, will be sentenced on 25 January. Lawyers acting for Mason, who denied murder, had claimed the killing was the result of self-defence or a loss of control. But the jury rejected this and found him guilty of murdering Alex by a majority of 10 to two. As the verdict was returned, Mason appeared to be crying in the dock. Members of Alex's family were also in tears. In a statement, they said they had ""never come across a more selfish, cold and calculating person"" as Mason. ""Mason has attempted to blame Alex and discredit his name throughout this trial and thankfully the jury were able to see through his web of deceit,"" they said. Speaking outside the court, Alex's father Adam Rodda said the trial had been ""very difficult"" for the family and they were relieved Mason had been found guilty of murder. ""We wouldn't have accepted anything else, we would have been distraught if any other verdict had been given. We prayed and we are obviously delighted that justice has been done,"" he said. Alex Rodda was killed in woodland in Cheshire On the evening of 12 December, Mason said he had picked Alex up from his home and drove him to a remote area of woodland where he told him he could not afford to give him any more money. The agricultural engineering student, who was the son of a farmer, told the court he had taken the wrench with him to ""scare him"". He claimed that, once in the woods, Alex had threatened to ruin his life ""financially or socially"" and pushed him to the floor, grabbing the wrench and hitting Mason with it. Mason said he managed to get the wrench from Alex and recalled hitting him with it twice, although the court heard evidence of further blows. Alex, a pupil at Holmes Chapel High School, was struck at least 15 times to the head and his body was found by refuse collectors the next morning. Evidence showed Alex had been struck at least 15 times with the wrench The jury heard Mason had paid Alex more than Â£2,000 to stop him reporting their ""intimate sexual relationship"". In the month before the murder, Alex contacted Mason's girlfriend to tell her that her boyfriend had been messaging him ""in a flirty way"" and had sent an explicit photo and video. Mason denied the claim but began making payments to the 15-year-old's bank account. By the time of Alex's death, Mason had transferred more than Â£2,200 and was asking friends and family to borrow money, the court was told. Giving evidence, Mason, who lived with his family on a farm near Knutsford, admitted having sex with Alex but said he thought it was ""wrong"". He told the court he did not believe his friends would accept him if he was gay or bisexual. In the week before Alex's death, Mason made internet searches for phrases including ""what would happen if you kicked someone down the stairs"", ""everyday poison"" and ""the mysteries of Cheshire unsolved deaths of missing people"". But he told the court he had been searching the terms because he was suicidal. Alex's body was found in woodland by refuse collectors After killing Alex, Mason had a drink with friends in the Red Lion pub in Pickmere and The Golden Pheasant pub in Plumley, Cheshire Police said. He later returned to the woods and the prosecution believe he dragged Alex's body to the side of the road and attempted to put him inside his car. After failing to do this, he drove away. But a witness had taken a photo of his Renault Clio car parked on the track and reported this to police. Mason was identified as the owner and arrested the next day. Police said Mason had dried blood on his hands and there was a bin bag in his boot with a blood-stained fleece, the wrench and Alex's jacket in it. Det Insp Nigel Reid said: ""Mason had murder on his mind as he drove Alex to his death under the pretence of sexual activity. ""He chose a secluded place to kill him in cold blood, a place he believed he would go unseen and his crime undetected.""

"PM says he has ""no doubt"" there is enough supply to vaccinate the first four priority groups by 15 February NHS CEO Sir Simon Stevens says there will be a ""huge acceleration"" in the vaccination programme over the coming weeks Army logistics expert Brigadier Phil Prosser says his mission is to get vaccines ""in arms not on shelves"" A further 1,162 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is being rolled out to hundreds of GP-run vaccination centres in England Nearly 1.5 million people across the UK have now had their first dose, Boris Johnson says A weekly doorstep round of applause returns at 20:00 GMT - under the new name of Clap for Heroes For the first time, Sweden is recommending face masks on public transport during rush hours Japan announces a new state of emergency for Tokyo and surrounding areas as infections reach record levels Global virus cases have exceeded 87m and nearly 1.9m have died during the pandemic, according to figures tracked by Johns Hopkins University Edited by Marie Jackson That's all from the live page today, thank you for joining us. Today's updates were the work of Alice Evans, Joseph Lee, Lauren Turner, Emma Owen, Mary O'Connor, Richard Morris, George Wright and Jennifer Meierhans. This page was edited by James Clarke. We'll be back tomorrow to bring you all the very latest. We'll be pausing our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic in a few minutes' time. If you're just catching up, here are some of the latest developments: Following the release of the official daily figures on coronavirus cases, deaths and other statistics, here's a look at the coronavirus epidemic in the UK, through graphs and charts: Alison HoltSocial affairs correspondent Hospital managers in areas with high numbers of Covid cases
say they are talking to residential and nursing homes about taking
patients to ease pressures. So how will this work? In England, each area should now have designated places with
high levels of infection control to take Covid positive patients who no longer
need hospital care. These beds might be in a separate care home â so called
âhot homesâ- or in the wing of an existing home, which operates with different
staff from the rest of the building. Many care providers have been reluctant to
even consider such a role after the high number of care home deaths in the
first wave. One care homeowner, who is taking Covid patients, says he
has some empty beds but with the new variant of the virus spreading so easily,
he wants his staff vaccinated as a priority. In addition, concerns over whether
homes are insured if they take Covid patients still havenât been addressed. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has just led a Downing Street news conference,
alongside NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens and
Brigadier Phil Prosser. Hereâs a quick recap of the key points: Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Staff at St George's Hospital in Tooting, south-west London Strong words from NHS England chief executive Sir Simon
Stevens about conspiracy theories that hospitals are not busy. He calls it an
insult to staff. One figure that is often used is the fact that around one in 10 beds are available â that is actually more than last year. But that does not tell you the full story Hospitals have only been able to achieve this by
cancelling planned care â that includes routine treatments like hip and knee
operations but also, in some places, urgent cancer care. More intensive care beds have been opened â there are a
fifth more than there were at the start of November. But there is not a space or the specialist staff to run
these. So staff are being redeployed and wards turned into
emergency intensive care areas. One in three patients in UK hospitals now has Covid â in
some areas it is as high as one in two. This is stretching the health service to the limit. NHS England's chief executive Simon Stevens was earlier asked about concerns from NHS staff about people who falsely claim the virus is ""fake news"" and that hospitals are empty. In his response calling the claims an ""insult"" to NHS staff, Sir Simon also praised media reporting on the real pressures hospitals are facing, including the BBC's. The BBC's Medical editor, Fergus Walsh, hasreturned to an intensive care unit at University College Hospital, in central London. It was the same intensive care unit that he first visited in April, during the first peak of the pandemic. Shell-shocked staff have told of the physical and mental toll the pandemic is having on them. ""My emotions are all over the place. Scared, sad, petrified, worried,"" one ICU nurse said. This video can not be played ICU hospital staff: 'Scared, sad, petrified, worried' Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online These new life-saving Covid drugs,tocilizumab and sarilumab,may be hard to pronounce but they are easy to
give. And the NHS already has stocks of them, meaning the sickest patients can
receive doses immediately, to save hundreds more lives. This treatment
breakthrough couldn't come soon enough. There are more than 30,000 Covid
patients in hospitals around the UK - far more than during the peak of last
April. In trials, it has been found the new drugs cut deaths by a quarter,
saving around one extra life for every 12 people treated. They also speed up
recovery and reduce the length of time that critically-ill patients need to
spend in intensive care by about a week The next question comes from the Evening Standard's Sophia Sleigh. She says London's hospitals are ""staring into the abyss"" , and less than two weeks off being overwhelmed by the surge in the number of coronavirus patients. ""Why wasn't more done to stop us ending up here?"" she asks. Sir Simon answers by saying the UK's four chief medical officers acted to move the UK's risk level up to level five on Monday - which reflected the strain on the NHS. He adds that the London Nightingale field hospital expects to open to patients next week - and says it will also be used as a vaccination centre. In response to Sleigh's second question, about how and when life might return back to normal, the PM says ""there will be the chance to look at some relaxations of restrictions"" by 15 February. However, he says this will only be the case if the vaccination programme goes ahead with the speed expected, and no further new variants of the virus develop by then. Johnson says reopening schools will ""certainly be the priority"" in any review of lockdown rules. ""I do think things will be much better by the spring,"" he adds. That brings an end to today's press conference. Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent I was struck today by the language, tone and palpable anger from the prime minister and Sir Simon Stevens about the drivel that floats around on the internet about the pandemic. The prime minister said those who've turned up outside hospitals suggesting Coronavirus is a scam should ""grow up."" And Sir Simon, whose public manner is normally measured and reserved, is clearly furious at some of the stuff he has seen on social media. ""It's a lie"" he said pointedly at claims hospitals are actually quite quiet and ""most obviously untrue"". Instead, he said, people should rely on established media sources - as he name checked ITV, Sky News, Channel 4 and the BBC. Will James of Reuters asks Sir Simon if he can guarantee people who have had their first Pfizer jab will get their second. Sir Simon confirms they will get a second jab. He says the gap between vaccines also means it can be offered to many more people. James also asks the PM for the final toll that will be seen by spring. Boris Johnson says he cannot give that number - but that it will be ""tragically far too high"". ""Every death is a tragedy, we mourn every person we lose in this pandemic,"" he adds. The ""overall toll"" will depend on the success of the vaccination programme - and also on everyone working together to stop transmission of the virus and protect the NHS. Chris Smith of The Times asks if Covid and other patients will be able to receive a normal standard of care in the NHS. Secondly, he asks if the government will move to younger age groups to make sure 13 million people end up being vaccinated. Simon Stevens of the NHS says ""uptake is likely to be high"" of the Covid vaccine, following on from high numbers of people taking the flu jab this winter. He says ""people have heard that message"" on the vaccine and the NHS is getting a ""good response"" when people are being offered the vaccine. He adds that the situation in London is ""very serious"" following the new variant of Covid, saying NHS hospitals in London are receiving 800 Covid patients a day, which is the equivalent of St Thomas' Hospital. Hospitals are expanding critical care areas so these can be surged when demand is necessary, but he warns ""it is vital that the infection rate now comes under control"". Boris Johnson adds it is ""important"" that the government sets high ""stretching"" targets for vaccination, as the NHS is under ""extreme pressure already"" and high levels of vaccination is what the public wants, to avoid further lockdowns. Johnson says people who claim hospitals are empty 'need to grow up' Victoria Macdonald from Channel 4 asks the prime minister if he regrets not locking down earlier - given that many patients now in hospital will have been infected before Christmas. Boris Johnson says that the government learned of the new variant on 18 December and tier four measures were put in place the next day for the vast bulk of the country. Macdonald also asks about concern from NHS staff about people out there who falsely claim the virus is ""fake news"" and that hospitals are empty. Johnson replies these people ""need to grow up"", saying that we have already heard from Sir Simon how much pressure the NHS is under. We all need to do our bit to protect it, he says. For the vast majority, this means staying home to protect the NHS - and for those invited to take the vaccine, to have the jab. Sir Simon says that if people sneak into a hospital late at night and film an empty corridor, they are responsible for potentially changing behaviour that will kill people. It is an ""insult"" to the intensive care nurse, working 12 hour shifts in the most trying of circumstances, he adds. ""There is nothing more demoralising than having that kind of nonsense spouted when it is obviously untrue,"" says Sir Simon, praising reports on Channel 4, the BBC, ITV and Sky for reporting what is actually going on in hospitals. ITV's Emily Morgan asks the PM to clarify why some GPs have reported not receiving regular supplies of the coronavirus vaccine, despite having capacity to administer doses. The prime minister says ""to the best of my knowledge we are rolling out supplies of both vaccines to GP surgeries"", and repeats his earlier remark - that there will be roughly 1,000 primary care vaccination centres up and running across the country by the end of the week. He insists the supply of both vaccines is being rolled out but adds: ""I won't hide from you - of course, in the early phases, there's going to be lumpiness and bumpiness in the distribution. Today it may be that some GPs aren't getting the consignment that they expected."" Sir Simon adds that today is the first day of the vaccine rollout by GPs - and that with more than a thousand locations for the vaccine to be delivered to on a daily basis, there will be bumps along the road. ""We've just got to have a sense of gathering round to get this thing done as a big team effort, rather than poking and prodding [at small bumps in the road],"" he says. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Lots of detail has been given about how the NHS â working
hand-in-hand with the military â will be able to deliver the vaccines. There will be more local vaccination centres, hospital
hubs and even mass vaccination at sports stadiums. Thousands of extra vaccinators have already been trained
â and thousands more are waiting in the wings. But the biggest hurdle the UK faces is vaccine supply. If it is not available, it cannot be put in arms no
matter how many centres and vaccinators we have. In the long term supply is not going to be a problem â
two vaccines have already been approved and there are encouraging signs others
will follow. But in the short term everything depends on how quickly a
plant in Wrexham can get the vaccine produced by Astrazeneca into vials and
then how quickly the regulator can carry out the safety checks. At the moment there is thought to be only a few million
doses ready for the NHS â with another 15 million or so going through this
system. The target to vaccinate the most at risk groups by mid-February is achievable â but it will require a lot to go right. The BBC's Alex Forsyth asks if Donald Trump was responsible for inciting the storming of Congress in Washington DC. She also asks if the government can deliver in their promises on the vaccine. Boris Johnson says the US has stood for ""freedom"" and ""democracy"". He says what Mr Trump has done, casting doubt on the election result, was ""completely wrong"". He says he condemns anyone who would encourage people to behave the way they did in the Capitol. He says he is ""very pleased"" that democracy has prevailed and Joe Biden is the President-Elect. But he says the purpose of this press conference is to hear more detail on the vaccine roll-out. He adds that on Monday, there will be a further press conference with Matt Hancock giving specific details on the vaccination programme. Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent It is inevitable that part of the politics of a pandemic is the perceived relative performance of different countries. You can pick your metric to make your comparison, and plenty have. The death toll in the UK, and the economic slump, have come in for particular criticism. But the government has, for some time, sought to emphasise how the UK is ahead of the game on vaccinations. The UK was considerably quicker than the EU, for instance, in licencing the first vaccine, from Pfizer-BioNTech. At today's news conference, the Prime Minister has pointed out that the UK has already given more people a first jab for Covid than all the other countries in Europe put together. Sir Simon Stevens, the Chief Executive of the National Health Service in England, added that the UK has jabbed four times as many people as Germany and 300 times more than France. But he acknowledged the scale of the ongoing challenge - trying to vaccinate as many people in the next five weeks as normally happens in five months with the flu jab. One final thought: ministers tend to suggest international comparisons are pointless or premature when the comparisons are less than flattering. They're rather keener on them when the numbers look better. Stephen from Sheffield asks how the government is supporting students In his second question from the public, Johnson is asked how the government is supporting university students at this time. The PM says the government needs to ""look hard"" at the deal students have been given and ""what we can do to support students"" and help them at this very difficult time. Many cannot go back to university except for key practical courses, he notes. The PM says he understands the frustrations - and especially the ""financial frustrations that entails"". He tells the questioner, Stephen, from Sheffield that the issue is being looked at - and that he will be hearing more on this from the education secretary. After hearing from Brigadier Phil Prosser, the Downing Street coronavirus conference is now turning to questions from members of the public. Judith from Leeds asks how early years provision can safely remain open, if primary schools have been deemed a ""vector"" for spreading coronavirus. The PM says the ""whole point is that we believe that schools are safe"", as is, he says, early years provision - but ""we have to look at the overall budget of risk - the overall spread that schools can be involved in"". He adds that it is ""very important"" to keep early years education open to help key workers stay at work during the pandemic. NHS CEO Sir Simon Stevens adds that many health service staff rely on having available childcare - so keeping early years open is ""hugely important to the NHS's effort"" to tackle the virus. Brigadier Phil Prosser, Commander of Military Support to the Vaccine Delivery Programme, is now speaking. He says his team are drawing on their logistics knowledge from previous military operations to help roll out the vaccine. He says the ""mission"" in this case is to ""support the NHS"" and to ""minimise the number of deaths, as quickly and as safely as possible"". But, he warns, the plan has ""many challenges"". The Army has to make sure that vaccines are available across the UK, and in the case of the Pfizer vaccine, have to be stored at -70C. This means ""the plan needs to be agile,"" he adds. He says the Army plans to distribute the vaccine as soon as it receives each dose, adding ""it needs to be in arms, not on shelves"". Something on this scale ""has not been done before, and we are learning as we go"", he says, and the logistics operation is ""unparalleled in its scale and complexity"". It is the equivalent, he says, of setting up a major supermarket chain in less than a month. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Protests in Washington DC led to crowds of Trump supporters breaking in and rioting throughout the US Capitol - one of the country's most important buildings. But what is the area surrounding the Capitol building and why is it so important? It's the area of Washington DC - the capital city of the United States - where Congress is situated. This is where the US government writes, debates and passes laws. The Hill also contains several other key sites - such as the US Supreme Court and the Library of Congress - as well as office buildings where lawmakers and their staff work. The Hill is centred around the US Capitol building - the main location protesters broke into. This is where elected officials in the Senate and the House of Representatives sit when debating and voting on laws, making up the upper and lower chambers of Congress. The floor of the House of Representatives is where the final counting of votes takes place to confirm the US president The floor of the House is also where lawmakers gather for key political events, such as the annual state of the union address, when the sitting president lays out his accomplishments and priorities going forward. At the heart of the US Capitol building is the Rotunda, a grand circular room. Its use is controlled by the House and Senate, and it has been the venue for presidential state funerals as well as for other prominent figures. The funeral for Congressman John Lewis was held in the magnificent Rotunda at the heart of the Capitol building Construction of the US Capitol began on top of Jenkins' Hill, referred to as Capitol Hill, in 1793. It was first completed in 1800, although it's gone through several reconstructions. President George Washington selected the surrounding area - now Washington DC - to serve as the nation's capital. Since then, several other key buildings have been placed on the Hill to serve Congress and the Supreme Court. The US Capitol's dome under construction in 1861 A history of violence at the US Capitol Who stormed Capitol Hill? The Capitol building had to be extended throughout the 1800s as the number of US states grew to accommodate the increasing numbers of senators and representatives. Today there are 100 senators (two for each state), and 435 voting members of the House of Representatives (divided up proportionally based roughly on the size of each state). On top of the Capitol dome is the Statue of Freedom - a helmeted female figure on a cast-iron pedestal. ""The US Capitol is more than a building - it is the embodiment of American democracy and our way of life,"" the US Capitol Historical Society said in a statement following the latest siege. Joe Biden will be sworn in as the next US president on 20 January in front of the famous white domed Capitol building.

"President-elect Joe Biden called the riot an ""insurrection"" Images of rioters storming the US Capitol in a bid to overturn the result of a democratic election have sent shockwaves around the world. Four people died during the attack, launched by supporters of President Trump after he addressed a rally in Washington. President-elect Joe Biden called it an ""insurrection"", while Vice-President Mike Pence said the violence had been a ""dark day in the history of the United States Capitol"". But this is not the first time the building - regarded as the symbolic heart of US democracy - has been hit by violence. From bombs to foreign invasions, here are four other times the Capitol was attacked. Follow our live updates What does a deadly day mean for Trump's legacy? In pictures: Pro-Trump protesters storm Capitol 'They tried to break in - then I heard a shot' Perhaps the most famous attack was by British forces during the War of 1812. British troops, led by Vice Admiral Sir Alexander Cockburn and Major General Robert Ross - set fire to the still-under-construction Capitol after invading Washington DC in August 1814 (though the building survived thanks to a downpour). The ruins of the Capitol following the British attack In retaliation for the Americans' burning of Upper Canada's capital at York a year earlier, the British troops also set fire to other parts of the city and key buildings, including the White House. The 1814 attack marks the only time that a foreign power has captured and occupied Washington. In 2014, the British embassy in Washingtonapologised after tweeting a picture of a White House cakesurrounded by sparklers, ""commemorating"" the burning of the building 200 years before. A century on from the British attack, Erich Muenter, former professor of German at Harvard University, exploded three sticks of dynamite in the Senate reception room. The explosion damaged the building, but nobody was killed. Muenter later said the attack was in response to American financiers aiding Britain against Germany in World War I. This video can not be played When a mob stormed the US capitol Writing under a pseudonym in the Washington Evening Star, Muenter said he hoped the attack would ""make enough noise to be heard above the voices that clamour for war"", adding: ""This explosion is an exclamation point in my appeal for peace."" A day after the attack, Muenter shot and injured financier JP Morgan Jr, before being subdued by Morgan's butler and arrested. He later took his own life. On 1 March 1954, four Puerto Rican nationalists pulled out the island's flag and shouted ""Freedom for Puerto Rico"" as they opened fire from the visitors' gallery of the House of Representatives, injuring five congressmen. ""I did not come to kill anyone, I came to die for Puerto Rico!"" cried the leader, Lolita Lebron, during her arrest. 'I came to die for Puerto Rico!' cried Lolita Lebron, left Lebron was sentenced to 50 years behind bars, while the three men were given 75 years. The sentences were all later commuted by President Jimmy Carter. His administration said the release ""would be a significant humanitarian gesture and would be viewed as such by much of the international community"". The group returned to cheering crowds in Puerto Rico. On 7 November 1983, an explosion ripped through the second floor of the Senate. Just minutes before the explosion, someone claiming to be from a group named the Armed Resistance Unit called a Capitol switchboard warning of a pending attack, saying it was in retaliation for US military actions in Grenada and Lebanon. Police cars outside the Capitol after the 1983 attack There were no casualties but there was some costly damage. In 1988, FBI agents arrested seven members of the radical-left Resistance Conspiracy group for the Capitol attack and separate blasts at Fort McNair and the Washington Navy Yard in 1983 and 1984. Linda Evans and Laura Whitehorn were jailed for conspiracy and malicious destruction of government property in 1991. Both are now free. How a Trump rally turned deadly at the Capitol.

"US President Donald Trump has less than two weeks left in office, but the Senate's top Democrat has called for his presidential powers to be removed immediately after his supporters violently stormed the US Capitol on Wednesday. ""What happened at the US Capitol yesterday was an insurrection against the United States, incited by the president. This president should not hold office one day longer,"" Senator Chuck Schumer said in a statement. He added that Mike Pence should invoke the 25th Amendment, which allows for a transfer of power from the president to the vice-president, either temporarily or permanently. ""If the vice-president and the cabinet refuse to stand up, Congress should reconvene to impeach the president,"" he said. Democrats of the House Judiciary Committee have also written a letter to Vice-President Pence urging him to act to remove Donald Trump from office, saying he had stoked an act of insurrection and ""sought to undermine our democracy"".

In pictures: Pro-Trump protesters storm Capitol 'They tried to break in - then I heard a shot' The 25th Amendment allows the vice-president to become acting president when a president is unable to continue his duties, if for example, he or she becomes incapacitated due to a physical or mental illness. The part of the amendment being discussed is section four, which allows the vice-president and a majority of the cabinet to declare President Trump unable to perform his duties. Vice-President Mike Pence (L) would take over as acting president if Donald Trump's powers are removed They would need to sign a letter to the speaker of the House of Representatives and the presiding officer of the Senate declaring the president is unfit to govern or incapable ""of discharging the powers and duties of his office"".  At this point, Vice-President Mike Pence would automatically take over. The president is given the chance to offer a written response, and if he contests the finding, then it falls on Congress to decide. Any vote in the Senate and House of Representatives ordering the president's removal requires a two-thirds majority. Until the issue is resolved, the vice-president would act as president. Nancy Pelosi introduced legislation based on the 25th Amendment after President Trump's Covid-19 diagnosis Discussions about invoking the 25th Amendment also arose after President Trump's Covid-19 diagnosis in October last year, amid concern he may be too sick to run the country. What happens when a US president is too sick to work? Around the same time, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi introduced legislation based on the 25th Amendment that created a commission to review a president's fitness for office. The 25th Amendment was ratified in 1967, four years after the assassination of John F Kennedy, and was intended to address questions of presidential succession if a president becomes incapacitated. Republican President Ronald Reagan transferred powers to his vice-president for eight hours in 1985 whilst having surgery for cancer And for this reason, a number of presidents have used the amendment - specifically section three - which allows them to temporarily hand over power to their vice-presidents. In 2002 and 2007, President George W Bush placed his vice-president in charge when he was sedated during routine colonoscopies. President Ronald Reagan did the same in 1985 when he was in hospital for cancer surgery. But to date, no sitting president has ever been permanently removed using the 25th Amendment. There have been calls for President Trump to be impeached for a second time. Minnesota Democratic Congresswoman Ilhan Omar announced she was drawing up articles of impeachment against him, with a growing number of fellow Democrats voicing their support. Allow Twitter content?

Donald Trump has already been impeached once - by the Democrat-led House in December 2019 over allegations he improperly sought help from Ukraine to boost his chances of re-election. He faced two charges - abuse of power and the obstruction of Congress - but was later acquitted by the Republican-led Senate. He is only the third US president in history to have been impeached. Trump impeachment: The short, medium and long story To impeach means to bring charges in Congress that will form the basis for a trial. The US constitution states a president ""shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes or misdemeanours"". It is a political process, rather than a criminal one. It happens in two stages - articles are brought to the House of Representatives where, if passed, they proceed to the Senate for a trial. But here, a two-thirds vote is necessary for a president's removal - and this milestone has never been reached in US history. If President Trump were replaced through the impeachment process, Vice-President Mike Pence would move into the Oval Office. No president has ever been impeached twice during his time in office. Questions remain as to whether there would be enough time to impeach Donald Trump before his term ends on 20 January, when President-elect Joe Biden is inaugurated.

A new US citizen, a diehard Trump supporter, an anti-Trump Republican and a young Black Lives Matter protester - all members of our BBC voter panel - weighed in. Read what they said. Almost 60 Democratic members of the US House of Representatives have backed new articles of impeachment against the Republican president over Wednesday's unrest.

Donald Trump, who leaves office on 20 January, was impeached by the Democratic-held House in 2019 after he was accused of abusing his power and obstructing Congress. He was acquitted by the Republican-led Senate. Leading Democrats have also called for the president to be removed under the 25th Amendment, which allows the vice-president to step up if the president is unable to perform his duties owing to a mental or physical illness. It would require Vice-President Mike Pence and at least eight cabinet members to break with Mr Trump and invoke the amendment - something they have so far seemed unlikely to do. In a short press briefing that ran less than two minutes, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany condemned the armed insurrection at the US Capitol ""in the strongest possible terms"". Speaking ""on behalf of the entire White House"", she called the violence ""appalling, reprehensible and antithetical to the American way"". McEnany left the briefing room without taking any questions. President Trump has not been seen in public today and his social media accounts remain suspended. Washington DC's top prosecutor has not ruled out the possibility that the president himself could be investigated over the Capitol riot. Acting attorney general for the District of Columbia, Michael Sherwin, said ""all actors"" will be looked at. Asked whether this included Trump, Sherwin responded: âWeâre looking at all actors here and anyone that had a role and, if the evidence fits the elements of the crime, theyâre going to be charged."" The president had urged his supporters at a rally outside the White House to march on Congress, while pushing unfounded claims of electoral fraud. As events spiralled out of control, he tweeted urging them to ""remain peaceful"". The Association of Flight Attendants - a labour union that represents nearly 50,000 air crew - says it is ""taking a hard line for flight safety"" after problems aboard several flights to Washington DC. Citing the Capitol riot and the possibility that some participants might soon be flying back home, AFA President Sara Nelson suggested the culprits should be banned from planes. ""Acts against our democracy, our government, and the freedom we claim as 
Americans must disqualify these individuals from the freedom of flight."" In a video that went viral on social media, Trump supporters on a packed flight to the DC area heckled Senator Mitt Romney with chants of ""Traitor"". Trump's former chief of staff, John Kelly, has said he would vote to remove the president from office if he were still part of the cabinet. ""Yes, I would,"" Kelly, who served under Trump from 2017-18, told CNN's Jake Tapper in an interview on Thursday. ""The one thing we have going for us here, Jake, is that it's only 13 more days"", he added in reference to Biden's inauguration on 20 January. Wednesday's invasion of the Capitol has revived political talk of removing Trump from office via a constitutional amendment. Here's our explainer: What is the 25th Amendment? Allow Twitter content?

Today, the Senate's top Democrat joined voices calling for Trump's presidential powers to be removed immediately after his supporters violently stormed the US Capitol on Wednesday. Under the 25th Amendment, the vice-president can become acting president when a president is unable to continue his duties, if for example, he or she becomes incapacitated due to a physical or mental illness.

Find out more about the 25th Amendment here. The day before she died, Ashli Babbitt wrote on social media about the gathering of Trump supporters in the US capital. ""Nothing will stop us,"" she wrote. ""They can try and try and try but the storm is here and it is descending upon DC in less than 24 hours."" Babbitt, 35, was among the mob that breached the US Capitol on Wednesday. She has been identified by US Capitol Police as one of four people who died amid the chaos. A veteran of the US Air Force, Babbitt served two tours in Afghanistan and Iraq before later deployments with the National Guard to Kuwait and Qatar, her ex-husband, Timothy McEntee, told US media. A native of San Diego, California, Ms Babbitt had recently remarried, and worked at a pool service company with her husband, Aaron Babbitt. On social media, Babbitt described herself as a libertarian and patriot. She posted frequently about President Trump, expressing ardent support for him and echoing his unproven claims of wide-scale voter fraud. ""She had a personality that you either loved or hated,"" McEntee told NPR. ""She wasn't apologetic about it... she was proud of it, just like she was proud of her country and proud to be an American."" Read the full story here. Former First Lady Michelle Obama said Wednesday's events at the US Capitol ""desecrated the centre of American government"". In a lengthy statement released on social media, Obama said: ""Seeing the gulf between the responses to yesterday's riot and this 
summer's peaceful protests and the larger movement for racial justice is
 so painful. It hurts."" Decrying the sight of ""the traitorous flag of the Confederacy"", she lamented the ""cracked skulls and mass arrests"" that she said had been seen at Black Lives Matter protests. ""Millions voted for a man so obviously willing to burn down our democracy for his own ego,"" she said. She called on social media platforms to ""stop enabling this monstrous behaviour"" and permanently ban Trump. Obama also urged people to engage in ""the uncomfortable, sometimes painful process"" of ""putting America back together"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

As violent Trump supporters surged past barricades and into the US Capitol, news agency photographers - who were there to document the vote certifying Joe Biden's election win - captured extraordinary scenes. The last time government buildings were breached in Washington was in 1814 and the invaders were British soldiers. But in 2021 a Trump supporter, carrying the Confederate flag, is walking freely through the halls near the entrance to the Senate, encountering little resistance. Another image showed a rioter holding a podium bearing the seal of the Speaker of the House, while a third showed a man with a boot on the desk of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Yesterday's riots took place at the US Capitol - one of the country's most important buildings. It's the area of Washington DC - the capital city of the United States - where Congress is situated. This is where the US government writes, debates and passes laws. The Hill is centred around the US Capitol building - the main location protesters broke into. This is where elected officials in the Senate and the House of Representatives sit when debating and voting on laws, making up the upper and lower chambers of Congress. As well as these chambers, there are other office buildings where lawmakers and their staff work and meet to do their business. Find out more here. With his ban on Facebook and Instagram extended, President Donald Trump was notably absent on Wednesday as the US took stock of yesterday's events at the Capitol. According to the White House, one of his tasks for the day included presenting the country's highest civilian award, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, to three golfers - among them Babe Zaharias, who was honoured posthumously. Annika Sorenstam and Gary Player also received the honour. If you're just joining our live coverage, here are the top stories of the day so far: The
 US is reeling after supporters of President Trump stormed the Capitol 
building in Washington DC on the day Congress was meeting to confirm Joe
 Biden's election victory. Lawmakers
 were forced to take shelter, the building was put into lockdown and 
four people died in the chaos that followed a pro-Trump rally near the 
White House. Here's a breakdown of how events unfolded on Wednesday. Nga PhamBBC News South Vietnam flags were seen during the unrest On Wednesday, as protesters gathered outside before
swarming the Capitol building, the
yellow flags of the old South Vietnam regime could be seen. In fact, the yellow flags of the former South Vietnam are a common sight at
pro-Trump rallies across the United States. Vietnamese Americans, especially those of the older generation who fled Vietnam after
Saigon fell in 1975, are known for their support for the Republican party and
Donald Trump. A pre-election survey by the group Asian and Pacific Islander
American Vote found thatVietnamese Americans are the only major East Asian ethnic community that favoured Trump over Biden,external. Trumpâs anti-China and anti-communist rhetoric resonated greatly with the former refugees who risked their lives to escape
communism. But the support
for President Trump has also become an increasingly divisive issue amongst the
Vietnamese American community. Hours after the
Capitol riot, there are still calls on pro-Trump internet forums like
the ""ABC Trump"" Facebook page for Vietnamese Americans to âtake to
the streets in support of President Trumpâ as âthe battle
continuesâ. But there have also been condemnations. âThis is embarrassing,â
one young Vietnamese American wrote on Twitter, adding: âTheyâve brought shame to
the flagâ. Frank GardnerBBC Security Correspondent Saudi Arabia has been a close ally of the Trump administration Jihadist supporters of both the Islamic State group (IS) and al-Qaeda have been celebrating online the scenes of chaos and violence in Washington. The extremists and proponents of violent jihad - who view the US as their number one enemy - have been sharing images and videos from Capitol Hill, mocking American democracy and expressing hope that division will spread across the country. There was no immediate comment from either groupâs leadership on their official media outlets. The events will have deeply worried Americaâs allies in the Middle East, for whom the US acts as a security guarantor. Saudi Arabiaâs leaders, who had a close relationship with the Trump administration and who waited days before congratulating President-elect Joe Biden, will now be hoping for a period of calm. Sergeant-at-arms Paul Irving, who was responsible for maintaining law and order in the US House of Representatives, has resigned. His resignation was announced by Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi at her press conference moments ago. The top Democrat also said that she is calling for the resignation of Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund, who she says has not spoken to her on the phone once since violence was unleashed on the Capitol yesterday. Earlier today, her counterpart in the Senate, Chuck Schumer, said he would fire the Senate's sergeant-at-arms once Democrats become the majority in the chamber. Members of the Washington DC National Guard protect the Capitol on Wednesday night At a press conference earlier, Washington DC's mayor described yesterday's protests as ""textbook terrorism"" and ""an affront to democracy"". Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, squarely blamed Trump for inciting the violence seen yesterday. During the press conference, police also identified all four people that died during the chaos. Ashli Babbitt, a 35-year-old military veteran from California, was shot by a plainclothes Capitol police officer, according to Washington DC Police Chief Robert Contee. Benjamin Phillips, 50, Kevin Greeson, 55, and Rosanne Boyland, 34, also died after suffering ""medical emergencies"", he said. The three travelled from Pennsylvania, Alabama and Georgia respectively. This video can not be played Pelosi: 'President incited armed insurrection against US' Top Democrat Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House of Representatives, is giving a news conference now where she says she has a message for Trump's cabinet members. ""Do they stand by these actions? Are they ready to say for the next 13 days that this dangerous man can do more harm to our democracy?"" Pelosi goes on to say that the House may be forced to file of articles of impeachment due to Trump's recent ""seditious acts"". ""Although it's only 13 days left, any day could be a horror show,"" she tells reporters. Pelosi adds that Democrats are contacting her, demanding another attempt to remove Trump from office. To remind you, Trump has already been impeached once, by the Democrat-led House in December 2019 over allegations he improperly sought help from Ukraine to boost his chances of re-election. If impeached again, he would be the first president in US history to be impeached twice. ""My phone is exploding with 'impeach impeach impeach',"" she says. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Work to get pupils connected in Wolverhampton is well under way There are concerns some schools in lockdown could be inundated with pupils without laptops after a change to the vulnerable pupil list. Pupils are learning remotely in England after schools were closed on Tuesday to all but children of key workers and those deemed vulnerable. But those without laptops or space to study are now eligible to attend school, under government guidance. Heads' union, NAHT, said the move could reduce the effect of the shutdown. Schools were ordered to close to most pupils as a way of limiting the spread of the virus. National Association of Head Teachers general secretary Paul Whiteman said demand for key worker and vulnerable places in schools had risen substantially since the last school shutdown. Nearly a third of the 2,000 head teachers who joined an online union meeting on Wednesday afternoon reported having between 20 and 30% of pupils in school, the NAHT said. Mr Whiteman said: ""It is critical that key worker child school places are only used when absolutely necessary to truly reduce numbers and spread of the virus. ""We have concern that the government has not supplied enough laptops for all the children without them and so has made lack of internet access a vulnerable criteria - only adding to numbers still in school. What's happening with schools across the country? Schools closed with heaviest of hearts, says Gove We've all seen this coming, say angry heads How to be the school of Mum and Dad (again) ""It is important that all vulnerable pupils have access to a school place, but the government must provide laptops and internet access for every pupil that needs one, so that they can access home learning to take some of the strain off the demand for school places.

"Work to get pupils connected in Wolverhampton is well under way There are concerns some schools in lockdown could be inundated with pupils without laptops after a change to the vulnerable pupil list. Pupils are learning remotely in England after schools were closed on Tuesday to all but children of key workers and those deemed vulnerable. But those without laptops or space to study are now eligible to attend school, under government guidance. Heads' union, NAHT, said the move could reduce the effect of the shutdown. Schools were ordered to close to most pupils as a way of limiting the spread of the virus. National Association of Head Teachers general secretary Paul Whiteman said demand for key worker and vulnerable places in schools had risen substantially since the last school shutdown. Nearly a third of the 2,000 head teachers who joined an online union meeting on Wednesday afternoon reported having between 20 and 30% of pupils in school, the NAHT said. Mr Whiteman said: ""It is critical that key worker child school places are only used when absolutely necessary to truly reduce numbers and spread of the virus. ""We have concern that the government has not supplied enough laptops for all the children without them and so has made lack of internet access a vulnerable criteria - only adding to numbers still in school. What's happening with schools across the country? Schools closed with heaviest of hearts, says Gove We've all seen this coming, say angry heads How to be the school of Mum and Dad (again) ""It is important that all vulnerable pupils have access to a school place, but the government must provide laptops and internet access for every pupil that needs one, so that they can access home learning to take some of the strain off the demand for school places. ""Nearly half of head teachers who we polled during a webcast on Wednesday evening said that had received fewer than 10% of the laptops they'd requested. ""It is essential that this is rectified immediately, so that we can keep school attendance figures at a level which will have the desired impact on getting transmission rates under control.""

"Matthew Mason will be sentenced later this month A man who killed a schoolboy after paying him to stop their sexual relationship being revealed has been found guilty of murder. Matthew Mason admitted bludgeoning 15-year-old Alex Rodda with a wrench in Ashley, Cheshire, in 2019. The 19-year-old paid Alex more than Â£2,000 after he contacted his then girlfriend about ""flirty"" messages, Chester Crown Court heard. Mason, of Ash Lane in Ollerton, will be sentenced on 25 January. Lawyers acting for Mason, who denied murder, had claimed the killing was the result of self-defence or a loss of control. But the jury rejected this and found him guilty of murdering Alex by a majority of 10 to two. As the verdict was returned, Mason appeared to be crying in the dock. Members of Alex's family were also in tears. In a statement, they said they had ""never come across a more selfish, cold and calculating person"" as Mason. ""Mason has attempted to blame Alex and discredit his name throughout this trial and thankfully the jury were able to see through his web of deceit,"" they said. Speaking outside the court, Alex's father Adam Rodda said the trial had been ""very difficult"" for the family and they were relieved Mason had been found guilty of murder. ""We wouldn't have accepted anything else, we would have been distraught if any other verdict had been given. We prayed and we are obviously delighted that justice has been done,"" he said. Alex Rodda was killed in woodland in Cheshire On the evening of 12 December, Mason said he had picked Alex up from his home and drove him to a remote area of woodland where he told him he could not afford to give him any more money. The agricultural engineering student, who was the son of a farmer, told the court he had taken the wrench with him to ""scare him"". He claimed that, once in the woods, Alex had threatened to ruin his life ""financially or socially"" and pushed him to the floor, grabbing the wrench and hitting Mason with it. Mason said he managed to get the wrench from Alex and recalled hitting him with it twice, although the court heard evidence of further blows. Alex, a pupil at Holmes Chapel High School, was struck at least 15 times to the head and his body was found by refuse collectors the next morning. Evidence showed Alex had been struck at least 15 times with the wrench The jury heard Mason had paid Alex more than Â£2,000 to stop him reporting their ""intimate sexual relationship"". In the month before the murder, Alex contacted Mason's girlfriend to tell her that her boyfriend had been messaging him ""in a flirty way"" and had sent an explicit photo and video. Mason denied the claim but began making payments to the 15-year-old's bank account. By the time of Alex's death, Mason had transferred more than Â£2,200 and was asking friends and family to borrow money, the court was told. Giving evidence, Mason, who lived with his family on a farm near Knutsford, admitted having sex with Alex but said he thought it was ""wrong"". He told the court he did not believe his friends would accept him if he was gay or bisexual. In the week before Alex's death, Mason made internet searches for phrases including ""what would happen if you kicked someone down the stairs"", ""everyday poison"" and ""the mysteries of Cheshire unsolved deaths of missing people"". But he told the court he had been searching the terms because he was suicidal. Alex's body was found in woodland by refuse collectors After killing Alex, Mason had a drink with friends in the Red Lion pub in Pickmere and The Golden Pheasant pub in Plumley, Cheshire Police said. He later returned to the woods and the prosecution believe he dragged Alex's body to the side of the road and attempted to put him inside his car. After failing to do this, he drove away. But a witness had taken a photo of his Renault Clio car parked on the track and reported this to police. Mason was identified as the owner and arrested the next day. Police said Mason had dried blood on his hands and there was a bin bag in his boot with a blood-stained fleece, the wrench and Alex's jacket in it. Det Insp Nigel Reid said: ""Mason had murder on his mind as he drove Alex to his death under the pretence of sexual activity. ""He chose a secluded place to kill him in cold blood, a place he believed he would go unseen and his crime undetected.""

"Nguyen Huy Hung was one of 39 people who died in a container en route from Belgium to Essex The father of a 15-year-old boy who was one of 39 people to die in a lorry trailer said he learned of his son's death through social media. Nguyen Huy Hung died in the sealed container en route from Belgium to Purfleet, Essex, in October 2019. His father, Nguyen Huy Tung, said the family could not believe it until ""we saw his body by our own eyes"" at the hospital. Eight men are being sentenced for their role in the people-smuggling operation. The bodies of 39 Vietnamese nationals were discovered in a refrigerated trailer on 23 October last year The 39 Vietnamese migrants, aged 15 to 44, were sealed inside the container for at least 12 hours. The Old Bailey heard how it became a ""tomb"" as temperatures reached an ""unbearable"" 38.5C (101F). The people trapped inside had used a metal pole to try to punch through the roof, but only managed to dent the interior. The supposed 'VIP' journey that killed 39 people Irish smuggling connection to Essex lorry deaths At a sentencing hearing set to last three days in front of Mr Justice Sweeney, some of their final desperate phone messages were played in court. In one message, a man spoke with ragged breaths as he apologised to his family. ""I can't breathe,"" he said. ""I want to come back to my family. Have a good life."" In the background, a voice could be heard pleading: ""Come on everyone. Open up, open up."" Prosecutor Jonathan Polnay read out statements from the victims' families, and the mother of another 15-year-old who died, Dinh Dinh Binh, said her family had ""not been able to get back to our normal life yet"". ""Our economic conditions and work are negatively affected,"" she said. ""We have had to sell some properties of the family to afford our life."" The 39 people who died in the back of a trailer as it crossed the North Sea between Zeebrugge and the UK Tran Hai Loc and his wife Nguyen Thi Van, both 35, were found huddled together in the trailer, and left behind two children, aged six and four. The children's grandfather, Tran Dinh Thanh, said: ""At the moment their children are very small - this incident will affect their future. ""Every day, when they come home from school they always look at the photos of their parents on the altar. The decease of both parents is a big loss to them."" The moment lorry driver Maurice Robinson opened the trailer door and discovered the bodies inside was captured on CCTV Phan Thi Thanh, 41, had sold the family home and left her son with his godmother before setting off on the journey. Her son, who is now being looked after by his father in the UK, said he felt ""very heartbroken with mum not around"". Haulier boss Ronan Hughes, 41, of Tyholland, County Monaghan, Ireland, was described as a ringleader of the operation. He closed his eyes as the phone messages were played to the court. Other defendants hung their heads. Both Maurice Robinson (l) and Ronan Hughes (r) admitted 39 counts of manslaughter in connection with the case Hughes had previously admitted manslaughter, as had 26-year-old lorry driver Maurice Robinson, from County Armagh, who discovered the bodies in the trailer. Eamonn Harrison, 24, of Newry, County Down, who dropped off the trailer at Zeebrugge port, and people-smuggler Gheorghe Nica, 43, were convicted of the same charge by a jury. They will be sentenced alongside Christopher Kennedy, 24, from County Armagh, Valentin Calota, 38, from Birmingham, Alexandru-Ovidiu Hanga, 28, of Hobart Road, Tilbury, Essex, and Gazmir Nuzi, 43, of Tottenham, north London, who were convicted for their role in the smuggling. Gheorghe Nica and Eamonn Harrison were both found guilty of manslaughter Mr Polnay said: ""These defendants were party to a sophisticated, long-running and profitable conspiracy to smuggle [mainly] Vietnamese migrants to the UK, in the back of lorries, in a deliberate and intentional breach of border control."" The fee was between Â£10,000 and Â£13,000 for each migrant, for the ""VIP route"", the court heard. Mr Polnay said seven smuggling trips were identified between May 2018 and 23 October 2019, but there was ""an irresistible inference that there were more events than those that were fortuitously detected"".

"This video can not be played ""We will never give up, we will never concede"", Trump tells supporters This is how the Trump presidency ends. Not with a whimper, but with a bang. For weeks, Donald Trump had been pointing to 6 January as a day of reckoning. It was when he told his supporters to come to Washington DC, and challenge Congress - and Vice-President Mike Pence - to discard the results of November's election and keep the presidency in his hands. On Wednesday morning, the president and his warm-up speakers set the whirlwind in motion. Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer, said the election disputes should be resolved through ""trial by combat"". Donald Trump Jr, the president's oldest son, had a message to members of his party who would not ""fight"" for their president. ""This isn't their Republican Party anymore,"" he said. ""This is Donald Trump's Republican Party."" Latest updates and reaction Biden blasts 'siege' at Capitol Then the president himself encouraged the growing crowd, which had chanted ""stop the steal"" and ""bullshit"" at the president's prompting, to march the two miles from the White House to the Capitol. ""We will never give up. We will never concede,"" the president said. ""Our country has had enough. We will not take it anymore."" As the president was concluding his remarks, a different kind of drama was playing out within the Capitol itself, as a joint session of Congress prepared to tabulate the state-by-state results of the election. First, Pence - disregarding the president's urging to throw out the results from contested states - released a statement that he did not have such powers and his role was ""largely ceremonial"". Then Republicans issued their first challenge, to Arizona votes, and the House and Senate began their separate deliberations on whether to accept Joe Biden's victory there. The House proceedings were raucous, with both sides cheering as their speakers made their remarks. ""The oath that I took this past Sunday to defend and support the Constitution makes it necessary for me to object to this travesty,"" said newly elected Congresswoman Lauren Boebert, who had recently made headlines for insisting that she would carry a handgun with her in Congress. ""I will not allow the people to be ignored."" Protesters gathered outside the Capitol as the joint session started In the Senate, the debate was taking on a different tone. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, dressed in the kind of dark suit and tie that befits a funeral, was coming to bury Donald Trump, not praise him. ""If this election were overturned by mere allegations from the losing side, our democracy would enter a death spiral,"" McConnell said. ""We'd never see the whole nation accept an election again. Every four years would be a scramble for power at any cost."" The Kentucky senator, who will become the Senate minority leader as a result of his party's two recent defeats in Georgia, said that the chamber was designed to ""stop short-term passions from boiling over and melting the foundations of our republic"". His words were practically still hanging in the air when the passions outside the Capitol boiled over, and the Trump supporters, perhaps inspired by the earlier speeches, stormed the building. They swamped the insufficient security in place and brought the proceedings to a grinding halt, as lawmakers, staff and media rushed to find shelter from the rioters. This video can not be played How a Trump rally near the White House turned deadly at the Capitol The drama unfolded in fits and starts. Television cameras broadcast images of protesters dancing and waving flags on the steps of the Capitol. Photos and snippets popped up on social media of rioters inside the building, attempting to break into the legislative chambers and posing in the offices of elected legislators; of security officers, guns drawn in the House of Representatives, behind barricaded doors. In Wilmington, Delaware, President-elect Joe Biden scrapped a planned speech on the economy and condemned what he called an ""insurrection"" in Washington. ""At this hour our democracy is under unprecedented assault unlike anything we've seen in modern times,"" he said. ""An assault on the citadel of liberty, the Capitol itself."" He concluded his short remarks with a challenge to Trump: to go on national television to condemn the violence and ""demand an end to this siege"". This video can not be played Joe Biden: The scenes of chaos at the Capitol do not reflect a true America, do not represent who we are Minutes later, Trump would offer his message to the nation - but it was not the one Biden suggested. Instead, sandwiched between his now familiar complaints about the election being ""stolen"", he told his supporters ""to go home, we love you, you're very special"". It was the kind of kid gloves way the president has routinely responded to transgressions from his supporters - whether it was their violent treatment of protesters at his rallies, the ""very fine people on both sides"" statement after the clashes at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville or his ""stand back and stand by"" message to the far-right Proud Boys group during the first debate with Biden. Trump's tweet, and two subsequent ones which also praised his supporters, were flagged and then removed by Twitter, whichtook the unprecedented step of locking the president's account for 12 hours. Facebook followed suit, banning Trump for a full day. For the first time in his presidency, for the first time in his long, intimate relationship with social media, Donald Trump had been silenced. If this is the ""at long last, have you left no sense of decency"" moment for Donald Trump, it arrives as they're cleaning up blood and broken glass in the US Capitol. As the afternoon stretched into the evening, and police finally secured the US Capitol, a growing chorus of voices - from the left and right - condemned the violence. It was not surprising that Democrats, like soon-to-be Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, laid the riots at the feet of the president. ""January 6 will go down as one of the darkest days in American history,"" he said. ""A final warning to our nation of the consequences of the demagogic president, the people who enable him, the captive media that parrot his lies and the people who follow him as he attempts to push America to the brink of ruin."" More noteworthy, however, were the Republicans who followed suit. ""We just had a violent mob assault the Capitol in an attempt to prevent those from carrying out our Constitutional duty,"" tweeted Congresswoman Lynne Cheney, a frequent Republican critic of the president's. ""There is no question that the president formed the mob, the president incited the mob, the president addressed the mob."" The condemnations were not limited to Trump's reliable intraparty critics, however. Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, who frequently sides with the president, also spoke out. ""It's past time for the president to accept the results of the election, quit misleading the American people, and repudiate mob violence,"" he said. First Lady Melania Trump's Chief of Staff Stephanie Grisham and Deputy White House Press Secretary Sarah Matthews both resigned in protest, and there are reports that more administration officials will head for the exits in the next 24 hours. CBS has reported that Trump administration Cabinet officials are discussing the 25th amendment to the US constitution, which outlines how the vice-president and a majority of the Cabinet can temporarily remove a president from office. Whether Pence and the Cabinet act or not, Trump's presidency will be over in just two weeks. At that point, Republican Party leaders will have to grapple with a future where it has lost control of the Congress and the White House and has a former president whose reputation is badly tarnished but who still has strong sway over a sizeable segment of the party's base. This video can not be played Mitt Romney warns fellow Republicans not to be complicit in attack on democracy Wednesday's events could presage a pitched battle for the direction of the party, as conservatives within the party attempt to wrest control away from Trump and his loyalists. McConnell, given his remarks earlier in the day, appears willing to chart such a course. Others, like Utah Senator Mitt Romney, a former Republican presidential nominee, may also take a leading role. They will be challenged by others within the party who may be more interested in laying claim to Trump's populist mantle. It was notable that Josh Hawley of Missouri, the first senator to announce he would object the results of the election in the Senate, did not step away from his challenge even after the Senate reconvened following the violence in the Capitol. Crisis can bring political opportunity, and there are many politicians who will not hesitate to use it to gain advantage. Meanwhile, Trump - for now - is still in power. And while he may be chastened, he may be sitting in the White House residence watching television temporarily without his social media outlet, he will not be silent for long. And once he decamps for his new Florida home, he could begin making plans to settle scores and, perhaps, someday return to power and rebuild a legacy that, for the moment, lies in tatters.

"This video can not be played US Capitol riots: How the world's media reacted Shock and contempt for the violent storming of the US Capitol by Donald Trump's supporters is evident inÂ many reports and commentary on the event from around the world.Â From Germany's Die Welt daily describing ""disturbing, sad, terrifying scenes,external"", toÂ the Nigerian Tribune sayingÂ ""Trump supporters defile US democrac,externaly"", many criticise the outgoing presidentÂ for what what they see as his role in degradingÂ America's institutions and democracy. One commentator in Argentina's leading daily Clarin called it ""the 'scorched earth' legacy of Donald Trump,external"".Â Â ""Narcissism prevailing over all dignity,external, he harasses institutions, tramples on democracy, divides his own camp,"" says an editorial in France's Le Figaro.Â ""In refusing to quit, Donald Trumpexposes the fragility of the American system,externalin a final destructive offensive,"" a columnist says in France's Le Monde. Another headline in the paper calls him ""the insurrectional president,external"". InÂ Turkey, theÂ pro-government Turkiye paper notes: ""Trump's stubbornness stirred the US"".Â ""I expect Trump to be tried after this turmoil,"" said one pundit on Egypt's MBC Misr TV, adding that ""the US is no longer a superpower in the full sense of the word"". Several of America's adversariesÂ seized the opportunity to portray the incident as an example ofÂ the country'sÂ structural weaknesses and what they see as its hypocrisy.Â Â ""@SpeakerPelosi once referred to the Hong Kong riots as 'a beautiful sight to behold'Â â it remains yet to be seenwhether she will say the same,externalabout the recent developments in Capitol Hill,"" tweeted China's daily Global Times. ""Capital vandals show fragility of US democracy,external,"" claimed a headline in the paper.Â In Iran, state TV and radio inaccurately reported that the mayor of Washington DC had imposed ""martial law"", instead of the 12-hour curfew on the capital, which is what actually happened.Â And in Russia, where the first day of the Orthodox Christmas is currently being celebrated,Â footage of Trump's supportersÂ ransackingÂ the Capitol dominates state TV. Morning bulletins have focused on the events in America RollingÂ news channel Rossiya 24 has playedÂ scenes of the violence at length, with no comment other than the captionÂ ""Attack on the Capitol"". Some channels have also shown sympathy for the pro-Trump supporters, suggesting that they had cause to feel ""cheated"" over November's presidential election, and talked up claims that the event represents a crisis for US and even Western democracy. Rossiya 24 said they were ""dissatisfied with the most scandalous election in US history"", while Rossiya 1 said it was the US system of democracy that was ""to a large degree the cause of today's events"". Even for those not necessarily unfriendly to America, the incident shows serious rifts in society that Trump's departure won't address. It is ""a spectacular demonstration of frustration,externalthat has been building in the USA for decades,"" says one commentator in Poland's conservative daily Rzeczpospolita. ""Behind the faÃ§ade of plastered smilesâ¦ and phrases about 'the best country in the world' lies the drama of a gigantic income gap, society in which more and more people struggle to make ends meet, while the few do not even know how many billions they own.""

"PM says he has ""no doubt"" there is enough supply to vaccinate the first four priority groups by 15 February NHS CEO Sir Simon Stevens says there will be a ""huge acceleration"" in the vaccination programme over the coming weeks Army logistics expert Brigadier Phil Prosser says his mission is to get vaccines ""in arms not on shelves"" A further 1,162 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is being rolled out to hundreds of GP-run vaccination centres in England Nearly 1.5 million people across the UK have now had their first dose, Boris Johnson says A weekly doorstep round of applause returns at 20:00 GMT - under the new name of Clap for Heroes For the first time, Sweden is recommending face masks on public transport during rush hours Japan announces a new state of emergency for Tokyo and surrounding areas as infections reach record levels Global virus cases have exceeded 87m and nearly 1.9m have died during the pandemic, according to figures tracked by Johns Hopkins University Edited by Marie Jackson That's all from the live page today, thank you for joining us. Today's updates were the work of Alice Evans, Joseph Lee, Lauren Turner, Emma Owen, Mary O'Connor, Richard Morris, George Wright and Jennifer Meierhans. This page was edited by James Clarke. We'll be back tomorrow to bring you all the very latest. We'll be pausing our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic in a few minutes' time. If you're just catching up, here are some of the latest developments: Following the release of the official daily figures on coronavirus cases, deaths and other statistics, here's a look at the coronavirus epidemic in the UK, through graphs and charts: Alison HoltSocial affairs correspondent Hospital managers in areas with high numbers of Covid cases
say they are talking to residential and nursing homes about taking
patients to ease pressures. So how will this work? In England, each area should now have designated places with
high levels of infection control to take Covid positive patients who no longer
need hospital care. These beds might be in a separate care home â so called
âhot homesâ- or in the wing of an existing home, which operates with different
staff from the rest of the building. Many care providers have been reluctant to
even consider such a role after the high number of care home deaths in the
first wave. One care homeowner, who is taking Covid patients, says he
has some empty beds but with the new variant of the virus spreading so easily,
he wants his staff vaccinated as a priority. In addition, concerns over whether
homes are insured if they take Covid patients still havenât been addressed. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has just led a Downing Street news conference,
alongside NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens and
Brigadier Phil Prosser. Hereâs a quick recap of the key points: Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Staff at St George's Hospital in Tooting, south-west London Strong words from NHS England chief executive Sir Simon
Stevens about conspiracy theories that hospitals are not busy. He calls it an
insult to staff. One figure that is often used is the fact that around one in 10 beds are available â that is actually more than last year. But that does not tell you the full story Hospitals have only been able to achieve this by
cancelling planned care â that includes routine treatments like hip and knee
operations but also, in some places, urgent cancer care. More intensive care beds have been opened â there are a
fifth more than there were at the start of November. But there is not a space or the specialist staff to run
these. So staff are being redeployed and wards turned into
emergency intensive care areas. One in three patients in UK hospitals now has Covid â in
some areas it is as high as one in two. This is stretching the health service to the limit. NHS England's chief executive Simon Stevens was earlier asked about concerns from NHS staff about people who falsely claim the virus is ""fake news"" and that hospitals are empty. In his response calling the claims an ""insult"" to NHS staff, Sir Simon also praised media reporting on the real pressures hospitals are facing, including the BBC's. The BBC's Medical editor, Fergus Walsh, hasreturned to an intensive care unit at University College Hospital, in central London. It was the same intensive care unit that he first visited in April, during the first peak of the pandemic. Shell-shocked staff have told of the physical and mental toll the pandemic is having on them. ""My emotions are all over the place. Scared, sad, petrified, worried,"" one ICU nurse said. This video can not be played ICU hospital staff: 'Scared, sad, petrified, worried' Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online These new life-saving Covid drugs,tocilizumab and sarilumab,may be hard to pronounce but they are easy to
give. And the NHS already has stocks of them, meaning the sickest patients can
receive doses immediately, to save hundreds more lives. This treatment
breakthrough couldn't come soon enough. There are more than 30,000 Covid
patients in hospitals around the UK - far more than during the peak of last
April. In trials, it has been found the new drugs cut deaths by a quarter,
saving around one extra life for every 12 people treated. They also speed up
recovery and reduce the length of time that critically-ill patients need to
spend in intensive care by about a week The next question comes from the Evening Standard's Sophia Sleigh. She says London's hospitals are ""staring into the abyss"" , and less than two weeks off being overwhelmed by the surge in the number of coronavirus patients. ""Why wasn't more done to stop us ending up here?"" she asks. Sir Simon answers by saying the UK's four chief medical officers acted to move the UK's risk level up to level five on Monday - which reflected the strain on the NHS. He adds that the London Nightingale field hospital expects to open to patients next week - and says it will also be used as a vaccination centre. In response to Sleigh's second question, about how and when life might return back to normal, the PM says ""there will be the chance to look at some relaxations of restrictions"" by 15 February. However, he says this will only be the case if the vaccination programme goes ahead with the speed expected, and no further new variants of the virus develop by then. Johnson says reopening schools will ""certainly be the priority"" in any review of lockdown rules. ""I do think things will be much better by the spring,"" he adds. That brings an end to today's press conference. Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent I was struck today by the language, tone and palpable anger from the prime minister and Sir Simon Stevens about the drivel that floats around on the internet about the pandemic. The prime minister said those who've turned up outside hospitals suggesting Coronavirus is a scam should ""grow up."" And Sir Simon, whose public manner is normally measured and reserved, is clearly furious at some of the stuff he has seen on social media. ""It's a lie"" he said pointedly at claims hospitals are actually quite quiet and ""most obviously untrue"". Instead, he said, people should rely on established media sources - as he name checked ITV, Sky News, Channel 4 and the BBC. Will James of Reuters asks Sir Simon if he can guarantee people who have had their first Pfizer jab will get their second. Sir Simon confirms they will get a second jab. He says the gap between vaccines also means it can be offered to many more people. James also asks the PM for the final toll that will be seen by spring. Boris Johnson says he cannot give that number - but that it will be ""tragically far too high"". ""Every death is a tragedy, we mourn every person we lose in this pandemic,"" he adds. The ""overall toll"" will depend on the success of the vaccination programme - and also on everyone working together to stop transmission of the virus and protect the NHS. Chris Smith of The Times asks if Covid and other patients will be able to receive a normal standard of care in the NHS. Secondly, he asks if the government will move to younger age groups to make sure 13 million people end up being vaccinated. Simon Stevens of the NHS says ""uptake is likely to be high"" of the Covid vaccine, following on from high numbers of people taking the flu jab this winter. He says ""people have heard that message"" on the vaccine and the NHS is getting a ""good response"" when people are being offered the vaccine. He adds that the situation in London is ""very serious"" following the new variant of Covid, saying NHS hospitals in London are receiving 800 Covid patients a day, which is the equivalent of St Thomas' Hospital. Hospitals are expanding critical care areas so these can be surged when demand is necessary, but he warns ""it is vital that the infection rate now comes under control"". Boris Johnson adds it is ""important"" that the government sets high ""stretching"" targets for vaccination, as the NHS is under ""extreme pressure already"" and high levels of vaccination is what the public wants, to avoid further lockdowns. Johnson says people who claim hospitals are empty 'need to grow up' Victoria Macdonald from Channel 4 asks the prime minister if he regrets not locking down earlier - given that many patients now in hospital will have been infected before Christmas. Boris Johnson says that the government learned of the new variant on 18 December and tier four measures were put in place the next day for the vast bulk of the country. Macdonald also asks about concern from NHS staff about people out there who falsely claim the virus is ""fake news"" and that hospitals are empty. Johnson replies these people ""need to grow up"", saying that we have already heard from Sir Simon how much pressure the NHS is under. We all need to do our bit to protect it, he says. For the vast majority, this means staying home to protect the NHS - and for those invited to take the vaccine, to have the jab. Sir Simon says that if people sneak into a hospital late at night and film an empty corridor, they are responsible for potentially changing behaviour that will kill people. It is an ""insult"" to the intensive care nurse, working 12 hour shifts in the most trying of circumstances, he adds. ""There is nothing more demoralising than having that kind of nonsense spouted when it is obviously untrue,"" says Sir Simon, praising reports on Channel 4, the BBC, ITV and Sky for reporting what is actually going on in hospitals. ITV's Emily Morgan asks the PM to clarify why some GPs have reported not receiving regular supplies of the coronavirus vaccine, despite having capacity to administer doses. The prime minister says ""to the best of my knowledge we are rolling out supplies of both vaccines to GP surgeries"", and repeats his earlier remark - that there will be roughly 1,000 primary care vaccination centres up and running across the country by the end of the week. He insists the supply of both vaccines is being rolled out but adds: ""I won't hide from you - of course, in the early phases, there's going to be lumpiness and bumpiness in the distribution. Today it may be that some GPs aren't getting the consignment that they expected."" Sir Simon adds that today is the first day of the vaccine rollout by GPs - and that with more than a thousand locations for the vaccine to be delivered to on a daily basis, there will be bumps along the road. ""We've just got to have a sense of gathering round to get this thing done as a big team effort, rather than poking and prodding [at small bumps in the road],"" he says. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Lots of detail has been given about how the NHS â working
hand-in-hand with the military â will be able to deliver the vaccines. There will be more local vaccination centres, hospital
hubs and even mass vaccination at sports stadiums. Thousands of extra vaccinators have already been trained
â and thousands more are waiting in the wings. But the biggest hurdle the UK faces is vaccine supply. If it is not available, it cannot be put in arms no
matter how many centres and vaccinators we have. In the long term supply is not going to be a problem â
two vaccines have already been approved and there are encouraging signs others
will follow. But in the short term everything depends on how quickly a
plant in Wrexham can get the vaccine produced by Astrazeneca into vials and
then how quickly the regulator can carry out the safety checks. At the moment there is thought to be only a few million
doses ready for the NHS â with another 15 million or so going through this
system. The target to vaccinate the most at risk groups by mid-February is achievable â but it will require a lot to go right. The BBC's Alex Forsyth asks if Donald Trump was responsible for inciting the storming of Congress in Washington DC. She also asks if the government can deliver in their promises on the vaccine. Boris Johnson says the US has stood for ""freedom"" and ""democracy"". He says what Mr Trump has done, casting doubt on the election result, was ""completely wrong"". He says he condemns anyone who would encourage people to behave the way they did in the Capitol. He says he is ""very pleased"" that democracy has prevailed and Joe Biden is the President-Elect. But he says the purpose of this press conference is to hear more detail on the vaccine roll-out. He adds that on Monday, there will be a further press conference with Matt Hancock giving specific details on the vaccination programme. Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent It is inevitable that part of the politics of a pandemic is the perceived relative performance of different countries. You can pick your metric to make your comparison, and plenty have. The death toll in the UK, and the economic slump, have come in for particular criticism. But the government has, for some time, sought to emphasise how the UK is ahead of the game on vaccinations. The UK was considerably quicker than the EU, for instance, in licencing the first vaccine, from Pfizer-BioNTech. At today's news conference, the Prime Minister has pointed out that the UK has already given more people a first jab for Covid than all the other countries in Europe put together. Sir Simon Stevens, the Chief Executive of the National Health Service in England, added that the UK has jabbed four times as many people as Germany and 300 times more than France. But he acknowledged the scale of the ongoing challenge - trying to vaccinate as many people in the next five weeks as normally happens in five months with the flu jab. One final thought: ministers tend to suggest international comparisons are pointless or premature when the comparisons are less than flattering. They're rather keener on them when the numbers look better. Stephen from Sheffield asks how the government is supporting students In his second question from the public, Johnson is asked how the government is supporting university students at this time. The PM says the government needs to ""look hard"" at the deal students have been given and ""what we can do to support students"" and help them at this very difficult time. Many cannot go back to university except for key practical courses, he notes. The PM says he understands the frustrations - and especially the ""financial frustrations that entails"". He tells the questioner, Stephen, from Sheffield that the issue is being looked at - and that he will be hearing more on this from the education secretary. After hearing from Brigadier Phil Prosser, the Downing Street coronavirus conference is now turning to questions from members of the public. Judith from Leeds asks how early years provision can safely remain open, if primary schools have been deemed a ""vector"" for spreading coronavirus. The PM says the ""whole point is that we believe that schools are safe"", as is, he says, early years provision - but ""we have to look at the overall budget of risk - the overall spread that schools can be involved in"". He adds that it is ""very important"" to keep early years education open to help key workers stay at work during the pandemic. NHS CEO Sir Simon Stevens adds that many health service staff rely on having available childcare - so keeping early years open is ""hugely important to the NHS's effort"" to tackle the virus. Brigadier Phil Prosser, Commander of Military Support to the Vaccine Delivery Programme, is now speaking. He says his team are drawing on their logistics knowledge from previous military operations to help roll out the vaccine. He says the ""mission"" in this case is to ""support the NHS"" and to ""minimise the number of deaths, as quickly and as safely as possible"". But, he warns, the plan has ""many challenges"". The Army has to make sure that vaccines are available across the UK, and in the case of the Pfizer vaccine, have to be stored at -70C. This means ""the plan needs to be agile,"" he adds. He says the Army plans to distribute the vaccine as soon as it receives each dose, adding ""it needs to be in arms, not on shelves"". Something on this scale ""has not been done before, and we are learning as we go"", he says, and the logistics operation is ""unparalleled in its scale and complexity"". It is the equivalent, he says, of setting up a major supermarket chain in less than a month. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played When a mob stormed the US capitol The US Congress has certified Joe Biden's victory in the presidential election, hours after supporters of Donald Trump stormed the building in an attack that saw four people die. Lawmakers resumed the session after police removed a mob that had been encouraged by President Trump as part of his attempt to overturn his defeat. The certification clears the way for Mr Biden to be sworn in on 20 January. In response, Mr Trump finally pledged an ""orderly transition"" of power. Follow our live updates here Wednesday's chaotic scenes followed months of escalating rhetoric from Mr Trump and some Republican allies that sought to undermine the result of the 3 November election. The invasion of the Capitol by the president's supporters - some armed - was an event without precedent in modern American history. Washington DC Mayor Muriel Bowser said one of the four who died - a woman named as Ashli Babbitt - was part of a group that forced entry into the chamber of the House of Representatives while it was still in session. They were confronted by plainclothes officers, and an officer pulled out a weapon and fired it. What does a deadly day mean for Trump's legacy? In pictures: Pro-Trump protesters storm Capitol 'They tried to break in - then I heard a shot' The US Capitol Police said the employee involved had been put on administrative leave pending an investigation. This video can not be played The US Congress has formally confirmed Joe Biden's victory Local media said Ashli Babbitt was a San Diego-area US Air Force veteran and Trump supporter. She was proclaimed dead at hospital. One woman and two men died as a result of ""medical emergencies"", officials said, without giving details. At least 14 members of the police were injured. The FBI is now seeking to identify those involved,externalin the rampage, which came after Mr Trump had told a rally he would never concede the election and urged his supporters to march on the Capitol. It also came on the daytwo Democrats won Senate seats in elections in Georgia,giving the party effective control of the whole of Congress. This major political victory will ease the passage of Mr Biden's agenda after he is inaugurated. Democrat Joe Biden's victory was confirmed at about 03:30 local time (08:30 GMT) on Thursday in a joint session presided over by Republican Vice-President Mike Pence, who called the violence a ""dark day in the history of the United States Capitol"". Mr Biden blasted the ""insurrection"" as Mr Trump, while telling the mob to ""go home"", continued to make false claims of electoral fraud. The outgoing president's Twitter and Facebook accounts were later frozenand remain blocked. Objections by some Republican lawmakers to overturn the result in Arizona and Pennsylvania were rejected. Congress formally certified the final electoral college vote, with Mr Biden receiving 306 votes to Mr Trump's 232. For days Mr Trump had been piling pressure on his vice-president to block certification. But in a letter to Congress on Wednesday, Mr Pence said he had no ""unilateral authority to decide which electoral votes should be counted"". This video can not be played 'I just want the real winner to be president' In declaring the final vote totals, Mr Pence said this ""shall be deemed a sufficient declaration of the persons elected president and vice-president of the United States"". Shortly afterwards Mr Trump said in a statement: ""Even though I totally disagree with the outcome of the election, and the facts bear me out, nevertheless there will be an orderly transition on January 20th."" On Thursday the White House press office issued a statement saying it ""grieves the loss of life"" and will continue ""to pray for a speedy recovery for those who suffered injury"". This is how the Trump presidency ends. Not with a whimper, but with a bang. For weeks, Donald Trump had been pointing to 6 January as a day of reckoning. It was when he told his supporters to come to Washington DC, and challenge Congress - and Vice-President Mike Pence - to discard the results of November's election and keep the presidency in his hands. Crisis can bring political opportunity, and there are many politicians who will not hesitate to use it to gain advantage. Donald Trump - for now - is still in power. And while he may be chastened, he may be sitting in the White House residence watching television temporarily without his social media outlet, he will not be silent for long. And once he decamps for his new Florida home, he could begin making plans to settle scores and, perhaps, someday return to power and rebuild a legacy that, for the moment, lies in tatters.Biden win certified by Congress after chaotic day Read more from Anthony In addition to Mr Pence, some Republicans who previously stood by the president have now spoken out. Has the Capitol been attacked before? The people who still believe Trump won What is the electoral college? Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell definitively broke with Mr Trump in an emotional speech from the chamber floor on Wednesday, saying: ""If this election were overturned by mere allegations from the losing side, our democracy would enter a death spiral."" After the session resumed, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer blasted the mob at the Capitol as ""rioters and insurrectionists, goons and thugs, domestic terrorists"", saying the president ""bears a great deal of the blame"". This video can not be played ""We will never give up, we will never concede"", Trump tells supporters Senator Kelly Loeffler, who lost her bid for election in Georgia's vote on Tuesday, said she could no longer in good conscience vote against certification as she had originally planned, citing the ""abhorrent"" invasion of the Capitol. With two weeks before Mr Trump leaves office, there are calls for him to be removed beforehand for instigating the attack on Congress. US media say somemembers of his cabinet have discussed invoking the 25th amendment to the Constitution, which deals with removing a president deemed unfit for office. Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee have said that Mr Trump's actions meet the amendment's requirements. On Wednesday afternoon protesters surged up the Capitol steps shoving past barricades and officers in riot gear to penetrate the building. The mob - some of whom wore body armour - used chemical irritants to attack police, according to Washington police. They shouted and waved pro-Trump, US and Confederate flags as they roamed the halls, demanding the results of the presidential election be overturned. Members of Congress scrambled for cover under their seats as tear gas was fired. Several thousand National Guard troops, FBI agents and US Secret Service personnel were deployed to help overwhelmed Capitol police. The apparent ease with which Trump supporters were able to act has raised serious questions about security. Two pipe bombs were recovered, one from the Democratic National Committee offices, not far from the Capitol, and one from the nearby Republican National Committee headquarters. The occupation of the Capitol lasted more than three hours before the building was secured by law enforcement. At least 52 people have been arrested, the vast majority of them for violating the 18:00 to 06:00 curfew. Washington is under an extended state of emergency until after Mr Biden's inauguration. After sitting at the desk of US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, one protester left a message reading ""we will not back down"" Responding to the violence, Mr Biden said the mob's activity ""border[ed] on sedition"" and that democracy was ""under unprecedented assault"". ""To storm the Capitol, to smash windows, to occupy offices on the floor of the United States Senate, rummaging through desks, on the House of Representatives, threatening the safety of duly elected officials. It's not protest; it's insurrection."" This video can not be played Joe Biden: The scenes of chaos at the Capitol do not reflect a true America, do not represent who we are Mr Trump posted a recorded video on Twitter saying: ""I know your pain. I know you're hurt... We had an election that was stolen from us. It was a landslide election, and everyone knows it, especially the other side. But you have to go home now. We have to have peace."" For the first time, Twitter froze Mr Trump's account, saying it would be locked for 12 hours. The social media giant demanded he delete three tweets that it said could stoke violence and threatening ""permanent suspension"". Facebook and Instagram followed suit. Hours earlier, Mr Trump had addressed a ""Save America Rally"" outside the White House, where he encouraged supporters to keep contesting the election result: ""Our country has had enough and we will not take it anymore."" Political figures from around the worldcondemned the violence.In the US, former President Barack Obama said history would rightly remember the assault on the Capitol as ""as a moment of great dishonour and shame for our nation"". Former President George W Bush said: ""It is a sickening & heartbreaking sight. This is how election results are disputed in a banana republic - not our democratic republic.""

It also came on the daytwo Democrats won Senate seats in elections in Georgia,giving the party effective control of the whole of Congress. This major political victory will ease the passage of Mr Biden's agenda after he is inaugurated. Democrat Joe Biden's victory was confirmed at about 03:30 local time (08:30 GMT) on Thursday in a joint session presided over by Republican Vice-President Mike Pence, who called the violence a ""dark day in the history of the United States Capitol"". Mr Biden blasted the ""insurrection"" as Mr Trump, while telling the mob to ""go home"", continued to make false claims of electoral fraud. The outgoing president's Twitter and Facebook accounts were later frozenand remain blocked. Objections by some Republican lawmakers to overturn the result in Arizona and Pennsylvania were rejected. Congress formally certified the final electoral college vote, with Mr Biden receiving 306 votes to Mr Trump's 232. For days Mr Trump had been piling pressure on his vice-president to block certification. But in a letter to Congress on Wednesday, Mr Pence said he had no ""unilateral authority to decide which electoral votes should be counted"". This video can not be played 'I just want the real winner to be president' In declaring the final vote totals, Mr Pence said this ""shall be deemed a sufficient declaration of the persons elected president and vice-president of the United States"". Shortly afterwards Mr Trump said in a statement: ""Even though I totally disagree with the outcome of the election, and the facts bear me out, nevertheless there will be an orderly transition on January 20th."" On Thursday the White House press office issued a statement saying it ""grieves the loss of life"" and will continue ""to pray for a speedy recovery for those who suffered injury"". This is how the Trump presidency ends. Not with a whimper, but with a bang. For weeks, Donald Trump had been pointing to 6 January as a day of reckoning. It was when he told his supporters to come to Washington DC, and challenge Congress - and Vice-President Mike Pence - to discard the results of November's election and keep the presidency in his hands. Crisis can bring political opportunity, and there are many politicians who will not hesitate to use it to gain advantage. Donald Trump - for now - is still in power. And while he may be chastened, he may be sitting in the White House residence watching television temporarily without his social media outlet, he will not be silent for long. And once he decamps for his new Florida home, he could begin making plans to settle scores and, perhaps, someday return to power and rebuild a legacy that, for the moment, lies in tatters.Biden win certified by Congress after chaotic day Read more from Anthony In addition to Mr Pence, some Republicans who previously stood by the president have now spoken out. Has the Capitol been attacked before? The people who still believe Trump won What is the electoral college? Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell definitively broke with Mr Trump in an emotional speech from the chamber floor on Wednesday, saying: ""If this election were overturned by mere allegations from the losing side, our democracy would enter a death spiral."" After the session resumed, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer blasted the mob at the Capitol as ""rioters and insurrectionists, goons and thugs, domestic terrorists"", saying the president ""bears a great deal of the blame"". This video can not be played ""We will never give up, we will never concede"", Trump tells supporters Senator Kelly Loeffler, who lost her bid for election in Georgia's vote on Tuesday, said she could no longer in good conscience vote against certification as she had originally planned, citing the ""abhorrent"" invasion of the Capitol. With two weeks before Mr Trump leaves office, there are calls for him to be removed beforehand for instigating the attack on Congress. US media say somemembers of his cabinet have discussed invoking the 25th amendment to the Constitution, which deals with removing a president deemed unfit for office. Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee have said that Mr Trump's actions meet the amendment's requirements. On Wednesday afternoon protesters surged up the Capitol steps shoving past barricades and officers in riot gear to penetrate the building. The mob - some of whom wore body armour - used chemical irritants to attack police, according to Washington police. They shouted and waved pro-Trump, US and Confederate flags as they roamed the halls, demanding the results of the presidential election be overturned. Members of Congress scrambled for cover under their seats as tear gas was fired. Several thousand National Guard troops, FBI agents and US Secret Service personnel were deployed to help overwhelmed Capitol police. The apparent ease with which Trump supporters were able to act has raised serious questions about security. Two pipe bombs were recovered, one from the Democratic National Committee offices, not far from the Capitol, and one from the nearby Republican National Committee headquarters. The occupation of the Capitol lasted more than three hours before the building was secured by law enforcement. At least 52 people have been arrested, the vast majority of them for violating the 18:00 to 06:00 curfew. Washington is under an extended state of emergency until after Mr Biden's inauguration. After sitting at the desk of US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, one protester left a message reading ""we will not back down"" Responding to the violence, Mr Biden said the mob's activity ""border[ed] on sedition"" and that democracy was ""under unprecedented assault"". ""To storm the Capitol, to smash windows, to occupy offices on the floor of the United States Senate, rummaging through desks, on the House of Representatives, threatening the safety of duly elected officials. It's not protest; it's insurrection."" This video can not be played Joe Biden: The scenes of chaos at the Capitol do not reflect a true America, do not represent who we are Mr Trump posted a recorded video on Twitter saying: ""I know your pain. I know you're hurt... We had an election that was stolen from us. It was a landslide election, and everyone knows it, especially the other side. But you have to go home now. We have to have peace."" For the first time, Twitter froze Mr Trump's account, saying it would be locked for 12 hours. The social media giant demanded he delete three tweets that it said could stoke violence and threatening ""permanent suspension"". Facebook and Instagram followed suit. Hours earlier, Mr Trump had addressed a ""Save America Rally"" outside the White House, where he encouraged supporters to keep contesting the election result: ""Our country has had enough and we will not take it anymore."" Political figures from around the worldcondemned the violence.In the US, former President Barack Obama said history would rightly remember the assault on the Capitol as ""as a moment of great dishonour and shame for our nation"".

"Two more life-saving drugs have been found that can cut deaths by a quarter in patients who are sickest with Covid. The anti-inflammatory medications, given via a drip, save an extra life for every 12 treated, say researchers who have carried out a trial in NHS intensive care units. Supplies are already available across the UK so they can be used immediately to save hundreds of lives, say experts. There are over 30,000 Covid patients in UK hospitals - 39% more than in April. The UK government is working closely with the manufacturer, to ensure the drugs - tocilizumab and sarilumab - continue to be available to UK patients. As well as saving more lives, the treatments speed up patients' recovery and reduce the length of time that critically-ill patients need to spend in intensive care by about a week. Both appear to work equally well and add to the benefit already found with a cheap steroid drug called dexamethasone. Life-saving coronavirus drug 'major breakthrough' Although the drugs are not cheap, costing around Â£500 per patient, on top of the Â£5 course of dexamethasone, the advantage of using them is clear - and less than the cost per day of an intensive care bed of around Â£2,000, say experts. Lead researcher Prof Anthony Gordon, from Imperial College London, said: ""For every 12 patients you treat with these drugs you would expect to save a life. It's a big effect."" In theREMAP-CAP trial,externalcarried out in six different countries, including the UK, with around 800 intensive care patients: Nearly 36% of intensive care Covid patients receiving standard care died The new drugs reduced that by a quarter, to 27%, when given to patients within 24 hours of them entering intensive care Prof Stephen Powis, NHS national medical director, said: ""The fact there is now another drug that can help to reduce mortality for patients with Covid-19 is hugely welcome news and another positive development in the continued fight against the virus."" Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock said:  ""The UK has proven time and time again it is at the very forefront of identifying and providing the most promising, innovative treatments for its patients. ""Today's results are yet another landmark development in finding a way out of this pandemic and, when added to the armoury of vaccines and treatments already being rolled out, will play a significant role in defeating this virus."" The drugs dampen down inflammation, which can go into overdrive in Covid patients and cause damage to the lungs and other organs. Doctors are being advised to give them to any Covid patient who, despite receiving dexamethasone, is deteriorating and needs intensive care. Tocilizumab and sarilumab have already been added to the government's export restriction list, which bans companies from buying medicines meant for UK patients and selling them on for a higher price in another country. The research findings have not yet been peer reviewed or published in a medical journal.

"GPs in England are receiving doses of the Oxford Covid jab as medics warn about overstretched hospitals. The rollout of the Oxford vaccine is part of the NHS's biggest-ever effort and aims to offer jabs to 13 million by mid-February - including all over-80s. But Health Secretary Matt Hancock admitted vaccine supply was a ""rate-limiting"" factor. Birmingham's NHS said there are enough supplies with more to come as politicians warned doses may run out. Some hospitals in England areat risk of becoming Covid-only sites, with rising admissions for the virus forcing trusts to cut back on other services. And hospital leaders have warned medics are becoming increasingly stretched with ""untrained staff"" used to fill gaps. It came as a further 1,162 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported on Thursday - the second consecutive day of more than 1,000 recorded fatalities - and 52,618 new cases. The latest NHS statistics also show that there were 30,370 patients with Covid in UK hospitals on Tuesday. The rollout of the Oxford vaccine to GPs will help increase vaccinations among thetop four priority groupswho are first in line to receive doses. The Department of Health said 1.3 million people in the UK, including almost a quarter of those aged over 80 in England, have received at least one dose so far. 1.3 million in UK have had their Covid vaccine Can we really jab our way out of lockdown? What are the UK's new lockdown rules? How busy are hospitals in England? Writing to Health Secretary Matt Hancock, the Birmingham political leaders criticised communication around the vaccination programme in the city. ""We acknowledge that the vaccination rollout is in its early days, but we have also learned today that Birmingham has not yet been supplied with any AstraZeneca stock, while current Pfizer stocks are scheduled to run out on Friday this week with currently no clarity on when further supplies will arrive."" They added ""it remains unclear who is responsible for overseeing the vaccination programme in Birmingham, and whom we should hold accountable for progress and delivery"". The letter is signed by Labour leader of Birmingham City Council, Ian Ward; Liam Byrne MP, Labour's candidate for the West Midlands mayor, and by Conservative MP and ex-minister Andrew Mitchell.

But NHS Birmingham and Solihull told the BBC: ""Thousands of people in Birmingham and Solihull have already been vaccinated and this continues at pace. ""We have sufficient supplies and more will be coming."" West Midlands mayor Andy Street said he has been assured supplies of the Oxford vaccine will be delivered to Birmingham on Friday. Elsewhere, Gillian McLauchlan, deputy director of public health at Salford Council, described ""teething"" issues with the vaccine rollout there. She told councillors at a local scrutiny committee: ""We have no control over vaccine supplies. We are told literally two days in advance 'your next lot of vaccines are coming'."" England's vaccination programme is described as the biggest in NHS history, with an aim to offer jabs to most care home residents by the end of January and the most vulnerable by mid-February. Officials leading the vaccination programme are adamant rollout is going to plan - and are cautioning against judging performance too early. Of course, there will be teething problems, but the fact remains the UK has vaccinated more per head of population than any other country apart from Israel and Bahrain. While rollout of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine started on Monday, it was actually only being used at the hospital hubs up to Thursday. Deliveries are now being made to hundreds of local vaccination centres. There are 17 in the Birmingham region so they should start to receive doses imminently. That should mean there is a vaccine available if they do run out of the Pfizer-BioNTech jab. Although disruption to the rollout of the programme in the city may still happen as local centres are warning they cannot book patients in until they know they have stock available. But the fact the city's leaders felt compelled to write to the health secretary to warn about this is an illustration of the pressure in the system at the moment. Given the high level of infections and current lockdown, there is a desperation in all quarters to get the most at-risk vaccinated as quickly as possible. And until the nation sees that translate into significant numbers of people getting vaccinated - 2 million a week is the goal - people will remain on edge. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was approved for emergency use on 2 December but requires specialist storage unsuitable for most GP practices, with doses largely delivered in hospitals. The Oxford-AstraZeneca jab was approved on 30 December and does not require specialist storage. It was first rolled out on Monday to hospitals and to GPs in England from Thursday. This video can not be played One medical centre in London is now vaccinating almost 1,000 people a week Mr Hancock visited a GP surgery in London to promote the roll out earlier - but staff there said delivery of the Oxford vaccine had been delayed. The health secretary said he was ""delighted"" care home residents would begin receiving their first Oxford jabs from GPs this week. ""This will ensure the most vulnerable are protected and will save tens of thousands of lives,"" he said. GP Ammara Hughes, a partner at Bloomsbury Surgery, told broadcasters its first delivery of the Oxford jab had been pushed back 24 hours to Thursday. She said: ""It's just more frustrating than a concern because we've got the capacity to vaccinate. And if we had a regular supply - we do have the capacity to vaccinate three to four thousand patients a week."" Mr Hancock described supply of vaccine as a ""rate-limiting"" step. He said: ""For the first three days with the Oxford vaccine we did it in hospitals to check that it was working well and it's working well so now we can make sure that it gets to all those GP surgeries that like this one can do all the vaccinations that are needed. ""The rate-limiting step is the supply of vaccine. We're working with the companies - both Pfizer and AstraZeneca - to increase the supply."" More than 700 local vaccination sites will administer jabs, with the government announcinga further seven mass vaccination sites across England. Another 180 GP-led sites, 100 new hospital sites and a pilot scheme involving local pharmacies will open this week. Meanwhile, nearly 19,981 second doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech jab - which was the first to be approved for emergency use in the UK last month - were administered between 29 December and 3 January, NHS England said. It came as Rupert Pearse, professor of intensive care medicine and a consultant at the Royal London, said his own intensive care staff are having to care for far more sick patients. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there would usually be a ratio of one fully-trained intensive care nurse for each patient in a unit but staff are becoming increasingly stretched. ""Right now we are diluting down to one [intensive care] nurse to three [patients] and filling those gaps with untrained staff and in some instances doctors helping nurses deliver their care... and we're even facing diluting that further to one in four,"" he said. All of the UK is now under strict virus curbs, with Wales, Northern Ireland and most of Scotland also in lockdown, and vaccinations are progressing across the devolved nations.

"Martin Wolstencroft remortgaged his house to start Arc Inspirations 20 years ago Just when the hospitality sector thought things couldn't get any worse, it has been hit by another lockdown. Last year's rolling closures forced Martin Wolstencroft to borrow Â£4m just to ensure the survival of Arc Inspirations, a bar chain with 17 venues across the north of England that he has spent the last two decades building into a successful business. And the latest lockdown has forced Mr Wolstencroft to ask his bank to lend him another Â£1m. He is far from alone. UK Hospitality says the closure of pubs, restaurants and hotels is costing business owners such as Mr Wolstencroft a total of Â£500m a month, even allowing for any government support. And that has led to a huge rise in debt. ""The money that we are borrowing is really just to stand still,"" Mr Wolstencroft said. ""We'll be coming out of this in a far worse position with far greater debt and it totally reduces our ability to grow our business for the future. ""And all of this has been brought about through no fault of our own."" What are the current rules for going to the pub? What are the UK's new lockdown rules? Hospitality worst-hit as unemployment rises again He reckons the debt he has taken on so far will take the business six years to pay back, which leaves him facing some difficult decisions. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has announced apackage of grantsworth up to Â£3,000 a month per property to keep retail, hospitality and leisure businesses afloat until the spring. But Mr Wolstencroft, who pays rents of more than Â£16,000 a month on some of his bars, described the grants as a ""mere drop in the ocean"". The effect of taking on huge debts with no prospect of reopening soon is a major threat to millions working in the hospitality sector. More than 1,600 restaurants closed last year, costing 30,000 jobs, says property adviser Altus. When bars, hotels and other hospitality businesses are included, almost 300,000 jobs were lost last year as a result of the pandemic, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics. And that figure is expected to more than double in the first three months of this year alone. Kate Nicholls, the boss of UK Hospitality, predicts the total will hit 660,000 by the end of March. UK Hospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls is calling for further support for the industry ""The longer that these restrictions are in place, the more rapidly businesses will simply run out of cash and be unable to to remain open,"" she said. A survey of the trade body's members revealed that 80% of businesses did not have enough cash to make it through to April. ""It's going to be unbelievably brutal in the first quarter,"" Ms Nicholls said. The latest lockdown follows a bruising Christmas period for the hospitality sector, which typically depends on a busy December to tide it over during January, traditionally a quiet month for pubs and restaurants. ""It's obviously very worrying for our industry,"" says Tim Hughes, who runs the Plough pub at Sleapshyde in Hertfordshire. ""They have banned takeaway sales of alcohol from pubs, but off-licences and supermarkets can carry on selling it,"" he said. Between them, Mr Hughes, his brother and his father run three pubs in the St Albans area. They have already borrowed Â£350,000 and Mr Hughes says the latest lockdown will force them to take on even more debt just to survive. Monthly fixed costs at each of the pubs run to Â£9,500 and only one of their venues qualifies for the full Â£3,000 grant, so Mr Hughes says the Treasury's support ""doesn't touch the sides"". It's the fourth time Mr Hughes has been forced to close the doors to the Plough - and each time it has cost him about Â£5,000. This time, he also had to give away Â£4,000 worth of jumbo pork, vegetarian and vegan Bavarian bratwursts, bought to give 2,000 customers a substantial meal in the pub's ""winter garden"" during the festive period. That was before an unexpected decision to put St Albans into tier three forced him to close the pub. He cancelled those bookings and refunded customers their Â£16,000. The Plough's ""winter garden"", which was booked up for the Christmas period, stands empty Ralph Findlay, the boss of Marston's, which has 1,700 pubs across the country and employs 14,000 people, said some pubs that had been forced to close their doors because of the lockdown would never reopen. Half of Marston's employees are under 25, he said. ""I really worry about the impact of this on their employment prospects in places where it's very difficult to find employment."" He has called for pubs to be given more time before they are required to pay business rates again, which will leave pubs facing an Â£800m bill as soon as the current rates holiday expires in March, according to the British Beer & Pub Association. That would force landlords, including Mr Hughes, to foot a bill that works out at Â£25,000 a pub. ""We are kidding ourselves if we think that more debt upon more debt is going to be sustainable,"" said Stephen Welton, executive chairman of the Business Growth Fund. ""Past recessions have shown very clearly that it's coming out of a recession - when companies are short of working capital - that they fall over."" For Mr Hughes at the Plough, he is looking for all the support he can get to avoid being put into a ""bigger black hole"". A Treasury spokesman said: """"We've taken swift action throughout the pandemic to protect lives and livelihoods."" He said the grant scheme would continue to support businesses and jobs through to the spring. What's the guidance for Covid in the UK now?

"This video can not be played Priti Patel says Donald Trump was wrong for not condemning the violence Donald Trump's comments ""directly led"" to his supporters storming Congress and clashing with police, Home Secretary Priti Patel has said. Four people have diedafter a pro-Trump mob stormed the building in a bid to overturn the election result. President Trump had urged protesters to march on the Capitol after making false claims of electoral fraud. Ms Patel said the president's words had fuelled the violence and he ""didn't do anything to de-escalate that"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson hascondemned the ""disgraceful scenes""and called for a ""peaceful and orderly transfer of power"". On Wednesday evening, President Trump later called on his supporters to ""go home"", while continuing to make false claims of electoral fraud. Hehas been suspendedfrom his Facebook and Instagram accounts for at least two weeks, and possibly indefinitely. Twitter has also frozen his account. The president has now said there will be an ""orderly transition"" to Democrat Joe Biden, whose November election victoryhas now been certifiedby US lawmakers. But he added that he continued to ""totally disagree"" with the outcome of the vote, repeating his unsubstantiated claims of electoral fraud. Hundreds of the president's supporters stormed the Capitol - where lawmakers were meeting to confirm Mr Biden's election victory - and staged an occupation of the building in Washington DC. Both chambers of Congress were forced into recess, as protesters clashed with police and tear gas was released. Ms Patel told BBC Breakfast the scenes were ""awful beyond words"". The home secretary said: ""His comments directly led to the violence, and so far he has failed to condemn that violence and that is completely wrong."" She added: ""He basically has made a number of comments yesterday that helped to fuel that violence and he didn't actually do anything to de-escalate that whatsoever... what we've seen is completely unacceptable."" Latest updates and reaction after mob storms US Capitol Biden blasts Trump supporters' 'siege' of Capitol In pictures: Pro-Trump protesters storm Capitol A woman died after being shot by police, and three others died as a result of ""medical emergencies"", local police said. Politicians across the UK's political parties lined up to condemn the scenes in Washington. Speaking on Thursday, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Trump should ""take responsibility"" for what happened, calling it the ""culmination of years of the politics of hate and division"". Sir Keir added he welcomed the outgoing president's agreement to an orderly handover, but told reporters ""he should have said it a long time ago."" Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Mr Trump had been ""inciting insurrection in his own country,"" and called it a ""dark period"" in US history. ""What we witnessed last night is not that surprising. In some senses, Donald Trump's presidency has been moving towards this moment almost from the moment it started,"" she told ITV's Good Morning Britain.

But senior Welsh Conservative Andrew RT Davies has been criticised after comparing the rioting topoliticians who supported a second referendum on Brexit.

Friend of President Trump and leader of Reform UK - formerly the Brexit Party - Nigel Farage tweeted: ""Storming Capitol Hill is wrong. The protesters must leave."" Meanwhile, Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey has defended the prime minister's response to the rioting. Asked on ITV's Peston programme why Mr Johnson hadn't criticised Mr Trump, she said: ""The prime minister has been clear tonight that we need a peaceful and orderly transition."" Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle has written to express his ""solidarity"" with US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, whose empty office was broken into by protesters. ""Seeing your office trashed in that way and its occupation by one of the rioters was particularly outrageous. I am just so relieved you were not hurt,"" he wrote. Trump supporters left this note on the desk of Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the House of Representatives. It is a truism of British diplomacy that every occupant of 10 Downing Street has to get on with every occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, regardless of their politics or character. Personal consideration is pushed aside. What matters is the national interest and staying close to one of Britain's closest allies. Thus even now, even after Donald Trump's incitement of the Capitol mob, even though there are less than two weeks until the inauguration, even as close Republican allies jump ship, Boris Johnson and Dominic Raab were reluctant to criticise the president by name in their initial response overnight. Yes, they condemned the violence. But of Mr Trump, not a word. This caution was matched by the Prime Ministers of fellow so-called Five Eyes intelligence allies, Australia and New Zealand, both of whom also both failed to mention Mr Trump in their condemnatory tweets. In contrast, European leaders were quick to blame the president personally. It was only this morning that a British minister, Home Secretary Priti Patel, felt able to follow suit in strong terms. So was this natural and sensible diplomatic caution in the midst of a febrile crisis? Or was this, as some Labour figures are already claiming, a function of the closeness between the current UK government and the Trump administration? It was only a few weeks ago thatDefence Secretary Ben Wallace told The Sun,externalthat he would miss Donald Trump because he was a good friend to Britain. Whatever one's views, it is certainly the case that the British government is seen on the international stage by some has having ideological proximity to Mr Trump. Changing that reputation is seen by many diplomats as a priority in the months ahead, a task made more urgent by events overnight.

"Martin Wolstencroft remortgaged his house to start Arc Inspirations 20 years ago Just when the hospitality sector thought things couldn't get any worse, it has been hit by another lockdown. Last year's rolling closures forced Martin Wolstencroft to borrow Â£4m just to ensure the survival of Arc Inspirations, a bar chain with 17 venues across the north of England that he has spent the last two decades building into a successful business. And the latest lockdown has forced Mr Wolstencroft to ask his bank to lend him another Â£1m. He is far from alone. UK Hospitality says the closure of pubs, restaurants and hotels is costing business owners such as Mr Wolstencroft a total of Â£500m a month, even allowing for any government support. And that has led to a huge rise in debt. ""The money that we are borrowing is really just to stand still,"" Mr Wolstencroft said. ""We'll be coming out of this in a far worse position with far greater debt and it totally reduces our ability to grow our business for the future. ""And all of this has been brought about through no fault of our own."" What are the current rules for going to the pub? What are the UK's new lockdown rules? Hospitality worst-hit as unemployment rises again He reckons the debt he has taken on so far will take the business six years to pay back, which leaves him facing some difficult decisions. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has announced apackage of grantsworth up to Â£3,000 a month per property to keep retail, hospitality and leisure businesses afloat until the spring. But Mr Wolstencroft, who pays rents of more than Â£16,000 a month on some of his bars, described the grants as a ""mere drop in the ocean"". The effect of taking on huge debts with no prospect of reopening soon is a major threat to millions working in the hospitality sector. More than 1,600 restaurants closed last year, costing 30,000 jobs, says property adviser Altus. When bars, hotels and other hospitality businesses are included, almost 300,000 jobs were lost last year as a result of the pandemic, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics. And that figure is expected to more than double in the first three months of this year alone. Kate Nicholls, the boss of UK Hospitality, predicts the total will hit 660,000 by the end of March. UK Hospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls is calling for further support for the industry ""The longer that these restrictions are in place, the more rapidly businesses will simply run out of cash and be unable to to remain open,"" she said. A survey of the trade body's members revealed that 80% of businesses did not have enough cash to make it through to April. ""It's going to be unbelievably brutal in the first quarter,"" Ms Nicholls said. The latest lockdown follows a bruising Christmas period for the hospitality sector, which typically depends on a busy December to tide it over during January, traditionally a quiet month for pubs and restaurants. ""It's obviously very worrying for our industry,"" says Tim Hughes, who runs the Plough pub at Sleapshyde in Hertfordshire. ""They have banned takeaway sales of alcohol from pubs, but off-licences and supermarkets can carry on selling it,"" he said. Between them, Mr Hughes, his brother and his father run three pubs in the St Albans area. They have already borrowed Â£350,000 and Mr Hughes says the latest lockdown will force them to take on even more debt just to survive. Monthly fixed costs at each of the pubs run to Â£9,500 and only one of their venues qualifies for the full Â£3,000 grant, so Mr Hughes says the Treasury's support ""doesn't touch the sides"". It's the fourth time Mr Hughes has been forced to close the doors to the Plough - and each time it has cost him about Â£5,000. This time, he also had to give away Â£4,000 worth of jumbo pork, vegetarian and vegan Bavarian bratwursts, bought to give 2,000 customers a substantial meal in the pub's ""winter garden"" during the festive period. That was before an unexpected decision to put St Albans into tier three forced him to close the pub. He cancelled those bookings and refunded customers their Â£16,000. The Plough's ""winter garden"", which was booked up for the Christmas period, stands empty Ralph Findlay, the boss of Marston's, which has 1,700 pubs across the country and employs 14,000 people, said some pubs that had been forced to close their doors because of the lockdown would never reopen. Half of Marston's employees are under 25, he said. ""I really worry about the impact of this on their employment prospects in places where it's very difficult to find employment."" He has called for pubs to be given more time before they are required to pay business rates again, which will leave pubs facing an Â£800m bill as soon as the current rates holiday expires in March, according to the British Beer & Pub Association. That would force landlords, including Mr Hughes, to foot a bill that works out at Â£25,000 a pub. ""We are kidding ourselves if we think that more debt upon more debt is going to be sustainable,"" said Stephen Welton, executive chairman of the Business Growth Fund. ""Past recessions have shown very clearly that it's coming out of a recession - when companies are short of working capital - that they fall over."" For Mr Hughes at the Plough, he is looking for all the support he can get to avoid being put into a ""bigger black hole"". A Treasury spokesman said: """"We've taken swift action throughout the pandemic to protect lives and livelihoods."" He said the grant scheme would continue to support businesses and jobs through to the spring. What's the guidance for Covid in the UK now?

"Sarah Bingham said she is a match donor for her daughter Ariel and eldest son Noah (far right) A mother with two children who need kidney transplants said she wishes she could help both of them, but can only donate one organ. Sarah Bingham's son Noah, 20, and daughter Ariel, 16, have the same rare genetic condition. Mrs Bingham, 48, is a donor match for her children and said her maternal instinct is to donate to both of them. But her organ was always due to go to her daughter and two family friends are matches for her son. Her husband Darryl, 49, is not a match, so cannot be a donor for their children. Both Noah and Ariel have nephronophthisis, which causes inflammation and scarring to the kidneys. Mrs Bingham, of Hexham, Northumberland, said although her son is ""very poorly"", he undergoes regular dialysis and is in a stable condition. Her daughter's kidney function ""has been deteriorating more in the last year"" and she will probably need a transplant first. Mrs Bingham said: ""I was all set to give a kidney to my daughter and then my son went into renal failure and he also needs a kidney. Obviously, I've only got one that I can donate. ""The renal teams don't push you [to make a decision], because you're putting yourself on the line to donate a kidney. ""You have to make that call yourself, but obviously as a mum when you've got two children who both need kidney transplants and you've expected to give your kidney to one, and suddenly the other one needs one as well, you feel this dilemma."" Noah Bingham is in a stable condition thanks to regular kidney dialysis Problems began in 2016 when Ariel started to feel constantly tired. Her fatigue was initially put down to exam stress, but tests at Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary found she had the kidney condition. Mrs Bingham was told she would be a suitable donor for Ariel when the time came. Then, in 2019, Noah became ill and was diagnosed with the same condition. He is stable, but would need to put on weight to undergo a transplant. The couple have another son Casper, 12, who is being tested to see if he also has the condition. Darryl Bingham is not a suitable match for his two eldest children Prof John Sayer, a kidney specialist at Newcastle's Freeman Hospital who is treating Noah, said nephronophthisis affects about one in 100,000 people. ""There's clearly a dilemma because there's a shortage of donors for patients needing kidney transplants. ""But kidney failure itself is not rare. There are 4,500 people across the country waiting for a transplant."" He added patients often face a ""gruelling and terrifying"" wait of about three years for a donor organ.

"Mr Christmas' light displays attracted thousands of visitors over the years The family of a man known affectionately as Mr Christmas has turned off his festive lights for the last time. Dave Edwards, 86, lit up his home in Croxley Green, Hertfordshire, with extravagant light displays for 42 years to raise money for charity. He died from canceron the eve of his annual switch-onin November. His daughter Sharon Markham called on local residents to ""continue to light up Croxley every year"".

"The president says he hates Big Tech. Yet he has loved using Twitter. He's used it as a way, for more than 10 years, to bypass the media and speak directly to voters. The 280 characters fits neatly with his style of political engagement - broad brushstrokes rather than details. And Twitter has undoubtedly benefited from President Trump too, the place to go to hear the latest musings from the most powerful person on the planet. That decade-long symbiosis has been ended with a shuddering halt. Immediately after the deadly riots, Twitterlocked the President's Twitter feedand asked Mr Trump to delete three tweets for violationsaround its Civic Integrity policy.,external, which he promptly did. After the suspension he tweeted as a new man, the nonsense claims of mass voter fraud replaced with a more conciliatory tone. Privately though Twitter was pondering whether it had gone far enough. Facebook had already acted, banning Donald Trump ""indefinitely"". After more than 48 hours of consideration, Twitter acted. It made unquestionably the most important moderation decision in its history. It banned the president of the United States. Some have asked why he wasn't kicked off sooner. Mr Trump or one of his associates appears to have deleted some of his most recent tweets Well, Twitter has very specific rules about world leaders. ""We recognise that sometimes it may be in the public interest to allow people to view tweets that would otherwise be taken down,"" Twitter's rules say. ""At present, we limit exceptions to one critical type of public-interest content - tweets from elected and government officials."" Chief executive Jack Dorsey had felt it was in the public interest to keep the account active, albeit with warning messages. ""No one is turning a blind eye,"" a senior source told the BBC before the ban. In short, Mr Trump had been allowed to remain on Twitter - despite numerous breaches of its rules - because he is the president. Trump blocked by Twitter and Facebook US Congress debates election after deadly riot Twitter to wipe Trump's followers before handover With less than two weeks to go of Trump's presidency, many social media companies have now decided enough is enough. Critics say the outgoing president's words on social media, for years, helped to incite Wednesday's storming of Capitol Hill. All the big social media companies have made it clear that - as a private citizen - if you continually look to peddle conspiracy theories and promote extremism, you should expect to be kicked out. With just a few days of his presidency left, Mr Trump is already being held to a different standard - his privileges stripped. What's driving this? To be cynical, social media companies are acutely aware that President-elect Joe Biden believes Big Tech hasn't done enough to quell fake news and hate speech on their platforms. Rioters broke into Congress after a speech by Mr Trump on Wednesday They are now desperate to show that they can, in fact, police their own platforms without the need for stringent legal reforms. What better way to show you're serious than to act on Mr Trump's misinformation? What will Mr Trump do next? Well he's already said he's looking into the possibility of building his own platform in the future. But for now he's consigned to the fringes of the internet. Can Trumpism survive without Big Tech?

"Olly Stephens was stabbed to death in Emmer Green in Reading on Sunday Three teenagers accused of murdering a 13-year-old boy who was stabbed to death have appeared in Crown Court. Oliver Stephens, known as Olly, was pronounced dead at Bugs Bottom fields, Emmer Green in Reading, on Sunday. Two boys, aged 13 and 14, and a 13-year-old girl have been charged with murder and conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm. They have all been remanded in youth detention custody and a provisional trial date has been set for 21 June. The three teenagers, who cannot be identified because of their ages, had appeared at Reading Youth Court earlier on Thursday before the Crown Court hearing. The defendants only spoke at the youth court to confirm their names, ages and addresses. The court heard the girl has also been charged with perverting the course of justice. The Crown Court hearing was told a potential trial was estimated to last five or six weeks. Police were called just before 16:00 GMT on Sunday following reports of an attack in fields on the boundary of Emmer Green and Caversham Heights. Olly was pronounced dead at the scene. In a statement released on Wednesday, his family said: ""An Olly-sized hole has been left in our hearts."" His parents said their son was ""an enigma"", and having both autism and suspected pathological demand avoidance meant ""he became a challenge we never shied away from"".

"A social worker, an ex-journalist, an academic and an American lawyer (clockwise from top left) were among the arrested When news of the first arrests began trickling through, Joey Siu got straight onto the phone to her friends in Hong Kong. As they stopped responding, one by one, she realised the crackdown was growing - and fast. The 21-year-old student activist, who fled to the US two months ago, watched the detentions mount on her screen: a social worker, an academic, a former journalist, an American lawyer. ""I panicked,"" said Ms Siu, as the scale of the operation became apparent, partly ""because of the fact that I can't go back and help."" Less than 18 months ago, she was one of the young protesters whose huge rallies shook Hong Kong and, like several dozen of those activists in recent months, she made the difficult decision to leave in fear of the widening clampdown and a feeling she could do more from overseas. China's new law: Why is Hong Kong worried? Mass arrests as HK swoops on pro-democracy camp On Wednesday, 53 people were arrested in Hong Kong, the biggest swoop on pro-democracy activists so far under a draconian security law imposed by Beijing just six months ago. It confirmed the worst fears of many - including Ms Siu's - that the legislation would be used to target peaceful activism and stamp out what was left of democracy in the Chinese-ruled city. The raids began early on Wednesday morning in an operation involving some 1,000 national security officers - a new special branch of Hong Kong police formed to enforce the national security law. It wasn't the first application of the controversial legislation,which has already targeted prominent figures such as media mogul Jimmy Lai, but it was the largest. A record number were arrested over unofficial primaries last year organised by pro-democracy camps ahead of a local election, which was ultimately postponed by the government. Hong Kong's rebel mogul and pro-democracy voice The background you need on Hong Kong's protests More than 600,000 Hong Kongers had turned out to vote and decide on candidates, a move that incensed Beijing and drew a warning from Hong Kong's Chief Executive Carrie Lam that the act could amount to subversion. It wasn't therefore a complete shock when the formal accusations materialised on Wednesday, but the wide spectrum of those detained marked a new shift in the policing of dissent. ""It's not illegal for people to organise and plan together for a winning strategy,"" said Victoria Hui, a politics professor at Notre Dame University, saying she was left speechless by the arrests. But what would be viewed as routine opposition activities elsewhere has been deemed as subversion in Hong Kong, she added. The city ""is rapidly becoming like the rest of China where any kind of organised dissent is not tolerated. Anyone, however minor, even a social worker, is vulnerable,"" Dr Hui told the BBC. ""People don't know when police are going to knock on their door."" John Clancey, an American human rights lawyer and longtime Hong Kong resident, was led away from his office by police Several detainees have stood out in this latest wave of arrests. Among those was John Clancey, the first US national detained under the new security law. Footage of the veteran lawyer, who has been practising in Hong Kong since 1997, was widely shared on social media. In it, Mr Clancey can be seen walking with a crutch as he is slowly led away by police. When a reporter asks if he has anything to say to Hong Kong people he replies, unfazed: ""Continue to work for democracy and human rights in Hong Kong."" Five flashpoints in Hong Kong's year of anger What led to a single gunshot being fired? Another notable detainee is the city's first registered ethnic minority social worker. Jeffrey Andrews, a 33-year-old Hong Konger of Indian descent, was one of the few people to speak out against racial injustice in the territory and took part in last year's primary. ""Arresting peaceful, reasonable and moderate members of the community shows that the national security law has nothing to do with security - instead the government can't cope with democratic aspirations,"" said Mark Daly, a lawyer who has lived in Hong Kong for 25 years and has worked with Mr Clancey on human rights issues. The impact of the new security law is palpable throughout Hong Kong. The months-long protests that took over swathes of the city in 2019 - and at times turned violent - began to peter out early last year, due to the pandemic. But the legislation introduced in June has had the effect of ending virtually all public campaigning since. This video can not be played The history behind Hong Kong's identity crisis and protests - first broadcast November 2019 Several people approached for this article - many of whom had been willing to march through the streets openly in 2019 - worried about the consequences of sharing their views. And few think the crackdown will end here. Some analysts are pointing to the judiciary as a potential next target for authorities. ""I think they'll continue to search out people,"" said Antony Dapiran, a lawyer and writer based in Hong Kong. ""What you'll have is a city that may be docile on the surface but with a great deal of tension under the surface,"" he told the BBC, adding that the democracy movement could even, after some years of relative silence, ""bubble up again"". For Winston Ho - a Hong Konger in his 20s who asked the BBC not to use his real name - the arrests are ""a strategy to exhaust the energy and resources"" of Hong Kong's civil society. Like many of the city's democracy supporters, he voted in the primaries and was left ""infuriated"" that democratic demands were being interpreted as a subversion of state power. ""This shows that democratic ballots are bullets in the CCP's [Chinese Communist Party's] eyes,"" he said. China jails activists who fled Hong Kong by boat Can Hong Kong's democracy fight survive the walkout? There is a growing sense of an emboldened Beijing willing to do whatever it takes to stifle any opposition. ""The Chinese leadership has decided that there are very few repercussions for them when they act on Hong Kong,"" said Professor Ian Chong from the National University of Singapore. Whereas earlier there may have been concerns about foreign investors in China that might affect trade in Hong Kong, he explained, perhaps now they ""believe they can weather those kind of pressures"". In this new climate, Mr Ho has watched his friends leave the city and knows several others who are making plans to follow suit. ""It's sadly a professional hazard"" for many, he told the BBC, particularly those like him who work on human rights issues. For now though, Mr Ho is hoping he doesn't have to make that choice.

"Matthew Mason will be sentenced later this month A man who killed a schoolboy after paying him to stop their sexual relationship being revealed has been found guilty of murder. Matthew Mason admitted bludgeoning 15-year-old Alex Rodda with a wrench in Ashley, Cheshire, in 2019. The 19-year-old paid Alex more than Â£2,000 after he contacted his then girlfriend about ""flirty"" messages, Chester Crown Court heard. Mason, of Ash Lane in Ollerton, will be sentenced on 25 January. Lawyers acting for Mason, who denied murder, had claimed the killing was the result of self-defence or a loss of control. But the jury rejected this and found him guilty of murdering Alex by a majority of 10 to two. As the verdict was returned, Mason appeared to be crying in the dock. Members of Alex's family were also in tears. In a statement, they said they had ""never come across a more selfish, cold and calculating person"" as Mason. ""Mason has attempted to blame Alex and discredit his name throughout this trial and thankfully the jury were able to see through his web of deceit,"" they said. Speaking outside the court, Alex's father Adam Rodda said the trial had been ""very difficult"" for the family and they were relieved Mason had been found guilty of murder. ""We wouldn't have accepted anything else, we would have been distraught if any other verdict had been given. We prayed and we are obviously delighted that justice has been done,"" he said. Alex Rodda was killed in woodland in Cheshire On the evening of 12 December, Mason said he had picked Alex up from his home and drove him to a remote area of woodland where he told him he could not afford to give him any more money. The agricultural engineering student, who was the son of a farmer, told the court he had taken the wrench with him to ""scare him"". He claimed that, once in the woods, Alex had threatened to ruin his life ""financially or socially"" and pushed him to the floor, grabbing the wrench and hitting Mason with it. Mason said he managed to get the wrench from Alex and recalled hitting him with it twice, although the court heard evidence of further blows. Alex, a pupil at Holmes Chapel High School, was struck at least 15 times to the head and his body was found by refuse collectors the next morning. Evidence showed Alex had been struck at least 15 times with the wrench The jury heard Mason had paid Alex more than Â£2,000 to stop him reporting their ""intimate sexual relationship"". In the month before the murder, Alex contacted Mason's girlfriend to tell her that her boyfriend had been messaging him ""in a flirty way"" and had sent an explicit photo and video. Mason denied the claim but began making payments to the 15-year-old's bank account. By the time of Alex's death, Mason had transferred more than Â£2,200 and was asking friends and family to borrow money, the court was told. Giving evidence, Mason, who lived with his family on a farm near Knutsford, admitted having sex with Alex but said he thought it was ""wrong"". He told the court he did not believe his friends would accept him if he was gay or bisexual. In the week before Alex's death, Mason made internet searches for phrases including ""what would happen if you kicked someone down the stairs"", ""everyday poison"" and ""the mysteries of Cheshire unsolved deaths of missing people"". But he told the court he had been searching the terms because he was suicidal. Alex's body was found in woodland by refuse collectors After killing Alex, Mason had a drink with friends in the Red Lion pub in Pickmere and The Golden Pheasant pub in Plumley, Cheshire Police said. He later returned to the woods and the prosecution believe he dragged Alex's body to the side of the road and attempted to put him inside his car. After failing to do this, he drove away. But a witness had taken a photo of his Renault Clio car parked on the track and reported this to police. Mason was identified as the owner and arrested the next day. Police said Mason had dried blood on his hands and there was a bin bag in his boot with a blood-stained fleece, the wrench and Alex's jacket in it. Det Insp Nigel Reid said: ""Mason had murder on his mind as he drove Alex to his death under the pretence of sexual activity. ""He chose a secluded place to kill him in cold blood, a place he believed he would go unseen and his crime undetected.""

"George had mottled skin, swelling on his lips, a high temperature and could not keep fluids down The mother of a baby who was treated in hospital for Covid-19 has urged parents to be alert to symptoms such as mottled skin and sickness. Myer Rudelhoff's four-month-old son George spent three nights in Basildon hospital, in Essex. He had patchy skin, swelling on his lips, a high temperature and could not keep fluids down. She said: ""I thought it was a sickness bug. I had no idea it was caused by coronavirus."" George spent three nights in Basildon hospital Diarrhoea, vomiting and abdominal cramps in childrencan be a sign of coronavirusaccording to some researchers, but theofficially recognised symptoms,externalare a fever, cough and loss of smell or taste. Mrs Rudlehoff, who lives in Basildon, noticed her son had a temperature on New Year's Eve but put it down to teething. George began vomiting the following evening and on 2 January she called NHS 111, who told her to take him to hospital. She said: ""I really did not want to go. I was so scared about him getting the virus there, I had no idea he had it. ""He got so poorly so quickly when we arrived and was really lethargic. They took a swab and, when they said he was positive, I burst into tears. It was such a shock."" Myer Rudelhoff was scared to take her son to hospital but realised he was too poorly and needed treatment The mother-of-two said she presumed it was not Covid-19 because he did not have a cough, though he did develop a mild one a few days later while in hospital. She said the staff were ""amazing"" and she wanted to reassure parents ""not to be afraid to go to hospital"" if their children were ill. George made a good recovery in hospital Nurses told her they had treated several other children with the same mottled skin and sickness and asked her to share her story to raise awareness of these symptoms. Mrs Rudelhoff's post on Facebook was shared nearly 7,000 times within three days. In the post, she said she felt ""upset, angry and frustrated"" because she had taken the illness very seriously but George had still managed to catch it. He was the only member of the family who tested positive. George was discharged from hospital and was making a good recovery at home, she said. George is now making a good recovery at home and is being looked after by his big brother Stanley Dr Kilali Ominu-Evbota, paediatric consultant at Mid and South Essex NHS Foundation Trust, said: ""It's great to hear that George is now back home and on the road to recovery. ""George's family did the right thing and we encourage parents to seek medical advice with their GP or via the NHS 111 service in order to get the correct treatment for their child."" Basildon has an infection rate of 1,265 cases per 100,000 people - compared to the average England rate of 606.9.

"Olly Stephens was stabbed to death in Emmer Green in Reading on Sunday Three teenagers accused of murdering a 13-year-old boy who was stabbed to death have appeared in Crown Court. Oliver Stephens, known as Olly, was pronounced dead at Bugs Bottom fields, Emmer Green in Reading, on Sunday. Two boys, aged 13 and 14, and a 13-year-old girl have been charged with murder and conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm. They have all been remanded in youth detention custody and a provisional trial date has been set for 21 June. The three teenagers, who cannot be identified because of their ages, had appeared at Reading Youth Court earlier on Thursday before the Crown Court hearing. The defendants only spoke at the youth court to confirm their names, ages and addresses. The court heard the girl has also been charged with perverting the course of justice. The Crown Court hearing was told a potential trial was estimated to last five or six weeks. Police were called just before 16:00 GMT on Sunday following reports of an attack in fields on the boundary of Emmer Green and Caversham Heights. Olly was pronounced dead at the scene. In a statement released on Wednesday, his family said: ""An Olly-sized hole has been left in our hearts."" His parents said their son was ""an enigma"", and having both autism and suspected pathological demand avoidance meant ""he became a challenge we never shied away from"".

"A protester wearing a shirt with the QAnon slogan 'Trust the plan' talks to police inside the US Capitol building on Wednesday Supporters of the QAnon movement were among the crowd that stormed the US Capitol building on Wednesday. Several prominent activists were spotted inside the building, and others flew Q-themed banners inside and out. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. President Trump - viewed as a hero by the movement - has stopped short of endorsing the conspiracy theory but has described QAnon activists as ""people who love our country."" So what is QAnon and who believes in it? At its heart, QAnon is a wide-ranging, completely unfounded theory that says that President Trump is waging a secret war against elite Satan-worshipping paedophiles in government, business and the media. QAnon believers have speculated that this fight will lead to a day of reckoning where prominent people such as former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will be arrested and executed. This video can not be played Trump on QAnon: 'They do like me' That's the basic story, but there are so many offshoots, detours and internal debates that the total list of QAnon claims is enormous - and often contradictory. Adherents draw in news events, historical facts and numerology to develop their own far-fetched conclusions. In October 2017, an anonymous user put a series of posts on the message board 4chan. The user signed off as ""Q"" and claimed to have a level of US security approval known as ""Q clearance"". These messages became known as ""Q drops"" or ""breadcrumbs"", often written in cryptic language peppered with slogans, pledges and pro-Trump themes. Twitter cracks down on QAnon conspiracy theorists ""Where we go one we go all"", often abbreviated as ""WWG1WGA!"" is one of the most popular QAnon slogans Actually, thousands do. The amount of traffic to mainstream social networking sites like Facebook, Twitter, Reddit and YouTube has exploded since 2017, and indications are the numbers have gone up further during the coronavirus pandemic. The big social media companies subsequently tightened their rules about QAnon content and took down hundreds of Q-supporting accounts and videos. But social media and opinion polls indicate there are at least hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people who believe in at least some of the bizarre theories offered up by QAnon. And its popularity hasn't been diminished by events which would seem to debunk the whole thing. For instance, early Q drops focused on the investigation by special prosecutor Robert Mueller. QAnon supporters claimed Mr Mueller's inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 US election was really an elaborate cover story for an investigation into paedophiles. When it concluded with no such bombshell revelation, the attention of the conspiracy theorists drifted elsewhere. True believers contend deliberate misinformation is sown into Q's messages - in their minds making the conspiracy theory impossible to disprove. QAnon supporters bring banners and flags to rallies in support of President Trump QAnon supporters drive hashtags and co-ordinate abuse of perceived enemies - the politicians, celebrities and journalists who they believe are covering up for paedophiles. It's not just threatening messages online. Twitter says it took action against QAnon because of the potential for ""offline harm"". Several QAnon believers have been arrested after making threats or taking offline action. In one notable case in 2018, a heavily armed man blocked a bridge over the Hoover Dam. Matthew Wright laterpleaded guilty to a terrorism charge,external. US conspiracy theory shuts school festival A Pew Research Center study in September 2020 found thatnearly half of Americans had heard of QAnon,external- double the number from six months before. Of those who had heard about it, a fifth had a positive view of the movement. And for many believers, QAnon forms the foundation of their support for President Trump. Mr Trump has, unwittingly or not, retweeted QAnon supporters, and prior to the election his sonEric Trump posted a QAnon meme on Instagram,external. How influential is a pro-Trump conspiracy theory? One outspoken QAnon supporter, Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, was elected to the US Congress in November.

"Hospitals are under increased pressure amid rising coronavirus cases Some hospitals in England are at risk of becoming Covid-only sites, with rising admissions for the virus forcing trusts to cut back on other services. There are now 26,500 Covid patients in hospital, meaning nearly a third of all people in hospital have the virus. In London, half of all patients being treated in hospital have Covid. It has prompted many hospitals to cancel routine operations to make more space - and there are now signs this is starting to happen for cancer care too. Doctors warned the impact on the NHS could be ""catastrophic"". It comes after a surge in patients in recent weeks. The number of Covid patients has risen by more than 50% since Christmas - and is forecast to continue doing so. There are now more than 3,000 new admissions a day on average, three times the normal winter rate for all respiratory conditions. This video can not be played WATCH: ICU hospital staff ""scared, sad, petrified, worried"" Chris Hopson of NHS Providers, which represents hospital managers, said the rising number of Covid cases was ""very worrying"" and had reached a ""critical point"", which was significantly affecting other services. He said that while the south east and east of England had borne the brunt of the rises, other parts of England were seeing rises too. In the last week alone there had been enough new Covid patients to fill 10 hospitals, he added. How busy are hospitals in England? Dr Nick Scriven, of the Society for Acute Medicine, said medical units, respiratory wards and elderly care wards had effectively become intensive-care areas with very sick patients being given oxygen therapy. He described the pressure on staff as ""intense"". Meanwhile, Prof Rupert Pearse, an intensive care consultant at the Royal London Hospital and member of the Intensive Care Society, said staffing levels in intensive care were being diluted to cope with one nurse to every three patients rather than the normal one-to-one. ""We are really very concerned now about the seriousness of the situation ... which is definitely worse than the first wave and proving much harder to deal with now as the resources we had in the first wave aren't available to us. ""So we're really struggling to provide the quality of patient care that we think patients deserve. And the impact of the pandemic is taking care away from other illnesses such as cancer and heart disease. ""In essence, the healthcare available to all of us is not as good as it should be right now."" Prof Pearse said that unless people took the lockdown seriously, the impact on healthcare across the country ""could be catastrophic"". The surge in cases has prompted increasing amount of non-Covid care to be stopped. This week, it emerged that potentially lifesaving cancer operations have been put on hold King's College Hospital in London because of the number of beds taken by Covid patients. This included all ""priority two"" operations - those doctors judge need to be carried out within 28 days. Prof Neil Mortensen, president of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, said he had heard from members that ""hospitals across London are having to cancel cancer surgeries as a result of the huge number of Covid-19 patients being hospitalised"".

"This video can not be played At Fullwell Cross Medical Centre, north London, they are now vaccinating almost 1,000 people a week The Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid vaccine is being rolled out to hundreds of GP-run vaccination sites in England. As part of the biggest vaccination programme in NHS history, the aim is to offer jabs to most care home residents by the end of January. By mid-February, the target is to vaccinate 13 million people in thetop four priority groups. But one surgery visited by the health secretary to promote the initiative said its delivery had been delayed. And leaders in Birmingham have warned stocks of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine are scheduled to run out in the city on Friday, and that it has not received any supplies of the Oxford-Astra Zeneca jab. Aletter,externalsent to Health Secretary Matt Hancock, signed by the Labour leader of Birmingham City Council, Ian Ward, Labour MP Liam Byrne and Conservative MP and former minister Andrew Mitchell, said there was ""currently no clarity on when further supplies will arrive"". They also criticise a lack of clarity over the vaccination programme, and say ""it remains unclear who is responsible for overseeing the vaccination programme in Birmingham, and whom we should hold accountable for progress and delivery"". 1.3 million in UK have had their Covid vaccine Can we really jab our way out of lockdown? What are the UK's new lockdown rules? More than 700 local vaccination sites will administer the Oxford jab. Another 180 GP-led sites, 100 new hospital sites and a pilot scheme involving local pharmacies will open this week. Selected hospitals began administering the vaccine on Monday. Mr Hancock said the jab was now being supplied to GP practices across the country as he visited the Bloomsbury Surgery in central London. The health secretary said he was ""delighted"" care homes residents would begin receiving their first Oxford jabs this week. ""This will ensure the most vulnerable are protected and will save tens of thousands of lives,"" he said. But GP Ammara Hughes, a partner at Bloomsbury Surgery, told broadcasters its first delivery of the jab had been pushed back 24 hours to Thursday. She said: ""It's just more frustrating than a concern because we've got the capacity to vaccinate. And if we had a regular supply - we do have the capacity to vaccinate three to four thousand patients a week."" Standing in front of Dr Hughes's surgery, Mr Hancock said: ""The rate-limiting step is the supply of vaccine. We're working with the companies - both Pfizer and AstraZeneca - to increase the supply."" The surgery said it was continuing to administer the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and had so far received three deliveries of that jab. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said vaccination centres and GP surgeries needed better information about deliveries of the vaccine and how much to expect to arrive. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworthtweeted,externalthat the scenes at the surgery were like something from political comedy The Thick of It, but added: ""Sadly it's no laughing matter."" The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was the first to be approved by the UK's medicines regulator in early December, followed by the British-made Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine four weeks later. Because it does not need to be stored at ultra-cold temperatures like the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, it can be transported and stored more easily, making it simpler to vaccinate housebound people and those in care homes. Around half a million doses of both vaccines are ready to be used this week, with millions more in the pipeline in the coming weeks. Next week,seven major vaccination hubs across Englandare set to begin operating, including the Excel Centre in London and Millennium Point in Birmingham. Broadly, vaccines are being given to the most vulnerable first, as set out ina list of nine high-priority groups,external, covering around 30 million people. They are thought to represent 90-99% of those at risk of dying from Covid-19. Residents in care homes for older adults and their carers 80-year-olds and over and frontline health and social care workers 75-year-olds and over 70-year-olds and over and clinically extremely vulnerable individuals 65-year-olds and over 16- to 64-year-olds with serious underlying health conditions 60-year-olds and over 55-year-olds and over 50-year-olds and over People aged over 80 in hospital, frontline health staff and care home workers have been the first to get the Pfizer jab at designated hospitals hubs and community sites across the UK. Meanwhile, nearly 19,981 second doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech jab were administered between 29 December and 3 January, NHS England said. Dr Nikki Kanani, a GP and medical director for primary care at NHS England, said the vaccination programme was ""off to a strong start with around one million people already vaccinated against coronavirus"". She said GPs, nurses, pharmacists and countless other staff and volunteers had been working ""around the clock"" to be able to launch almost 200 more sites this week. ""We will now be able to protect many more vulnerable people against the virus and faster,"" Dr Kanani said. Nearly a quarter of the over-80s in England have now been vaccinated in total, around 650,000 people, since Margaret Keenan became the first person in the UK to receive a Covid vaccine in December. On Tuesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said1.3 million people in the UK had received their first dose of a vaccine. On Wednesday, another 1,041 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test were recorded, the highest daily death toll since April. And 62,322 new cases were recorded on Wednesday, the highest daily rise since mass testing began. This video can not be played Why the Oxford vaccine matters All of the UK is now under strict virus curbs, with Wales, Northern Ireland and most of Scotland also in lockdown, and vaccinations are progressing across the devolved nations. England is under a third national lockdown - in a bid to prevent the NHS from becoming overwhelmed by the surge in coronavirus cases. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced a new lockdown on Monday - across mainland Scotland, Skye, Arran, Bute and Gighafor the rest of January. Level three restrictions apply in remaining areas of the nation. Wales has been in a national lockdown since 20 December, and schools and colleges in the nationwill remain closed until at least 18 January. In Northern Ireland - which entered a six-week lockdown on 26 December - ""stay at home"" restrictionswill be brought back into law from Friday. As of Monday, about 100,000 people in Scotland had already received a first dose of vaccine.The Scottish NHS hopes to vaccinateeveryone over the age of 50 and younger people with underlying health conditions by the start of May, supplies allowing. More than 35,000 people in Waleshave had a Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, and the Welsh government has said 40,000 doses of the Oxford vaccine will be available within the first two weeks. About 40,000 people in Northern Ireland have received a first dose, and health officials in the nation have said everyone aged over 80 will be immunised within weeks.

"GPs in England are receiving doses of the Oxford Covid jab as medics warn about overstretched hospitals. The rollout of the Oxford vaccine is part of the NHS's biggest-ever effort and aims to offer jabs to 13 million by mid-February - including all over-80s. But Health Secretary Matt Hancock admitted vaccine supply was a ""rate-limiting"" factor. Birmingham's NHS said there are enough supplies with more to come as politicians warned doses may run out. Some hospitals in England areat risk of becoming Covid-only sites, with rising admissions for the virus forcing trusts to cut back on other services. And hospital leaders have warned medics are becoming increasingly stretched with ""untrained staff"" used to fill gaps. It came as a further 1,162 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported on Thursday - the second consecutive day of more than 1,000 recorded fatalities - and 52,618 new cases. The latest NHS statistics also show that there were 30,370 patients with Covid in UK hospitals on Tuesday. The rollout of the Oxford vaccine to GPs will help increase vaccinations among thetop four priority groupswho are first in line to receive doses. The Department of Health said 1.3 million people in the UK, including almost a quarter of those aged over 80 in England, have received at least one dose so far. 1.3 million in UK have had their Covid vaccine Can we really jab our way out of lockdown? What are the UK's new lockdown rules? How busy are hospitals in England? Writing to Health Secretary Matt Hancock, the Birmingham political leaders criticised communication around the vaccination programme in the city. ""We acknowledge that the vaccination rollout is in its early days, but we have also learned today that Birmingham has not yet been supplied with any AstraZeneca stock, while current Pfizer stocks are scheduled to run out on Friday this week with currently no clarity on when further supplies will arrive."" They added ""it remains unclear who is responsible for overseeing the vaccination programme in Birmingham, and whom we should hold accountable for progress and delivery"". The letter is signed by Labour leader of Birmingham City Council, Ian Ward; Liam Byrne MP, Labour's candidate for the West Midlands mayor, and by Conservative MP and ex-minister Andrew Mitchell.

But NHS Birmingham and Solihull told the BBC: ""Thousands of people in Birmingham and Solihull have already been vaccinated and this continues at pace. ""We have sufficient supplies and more will be coming."" West Midlands mayor Andy Street said he has been assured supplies of the Oxford vaccine will be delivered to Birmingham on Friday. Elsewhere, Gillian McLauchlan, deputy director of public health at Salford Council, described ""teething"" issues with the vaccine rollout there. She told councillors at a local scrutiny committee: ""We have no control over vaccine supplies. We are told literally two days in advance 'your next lot of vaccines are coming'."" England's vaccination programme is described as the biggest in NHS history, with an aim to offer jabs to most care home residents by the end of January and the most vulnerable by mid-February. Officials leading the vaccination programme are adamant rollout is going to plan - and are cautioning against judging performance too early. Of course, there will be teething problems, but the fact remains the UK has vaccinated more per head of population than any other country apart from Israel and Bahrain. While rollout of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine started on Monday, it was actually only being used at the hospital hubs up to Thursday. Deliveries are now being made to hundreds of local vaccination centres. There are 17 in the Birmingham region so they should start to receive doses imminently. That should mean there is a vaccine available if they do run out of the Pfizer-BioNTech jab. Although disruption to the rollout of the programme in the city may still happen as local centres are warning they cannot book patients in until they know they have stock available. But the fact the city's leaders felt compelled to write to the health secretary to warn about this is an illustration of the pressure in the system at the moment. Given the high level of infections and current lockdown, there is a desperation in all quarters to get the most at-risk vaccinated as quickly as possible. And until the nation sees that translate into significant numbers of people getting vaccinated - 2 million a week is the goal - people will remain on edge. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was approved for emergency use on 2 December but requires specialist storage unsuitable for most GP practices, with doses largely delivered in hospitals. The Oxford-AstraZeneca jab was approved on 30 December and does not require specialist storage. It was first rolled out on Monday to hospitals and to GPs in England from Thursday. This video can not be played One medical centre in London is now vaccinating almost 1,000 people a week Mr Hancock visited a GP surgery in London to promote the roll out earlier - but staff there said delivery of the Oxford vaccine had been delayed. The health secretary said he was ""delighted"" care home residents would begin receiving their first Oxford jabs from GPs this week. ""This will ensure the most vulnerable are protected and will save tens of thousands of lives,"" he said. GP Ammara Hughes, a partner at Bloomsbury Surgery, told broadcasters its first delivery of the Oxford jab had been pushed back 24 hours to Thursday. She said: ""It's just more frustrating than a concern because we've got the capacity to vaccinate. And if we had a regular supply - we do have the capacity to vaccinate three to four thousand patients a week."" Mr Hancock described supply of vaccine as a ""rate-limiting"" step. He said: ""For the first three days with the Oxford vaccine we did it in hospitals to check that it was working well and it's working well so now we can make sure that it gets to all those GP surgeries that like this one can do all the vaccinations that are needed. ""The rate-limiting step is the supply of vaccine. We're working with the companies - both Pfizer and AstraZeneca - to increase the supply."" More than 700 local vaccination sites will administer jabs, with the government announcinga further seven mass vaccination sites across England. Another 180 GP-led sites, 100 new hospital sites and a pilot scheme involving local pharmacies will open this week. Meanwhile, nearly 19,981 second doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech jab - which was the first to be approved for emergency use in the UK last month - were administered between 29 December and 3 January, NHS England said. It came as Rupert Pearse, professor of intensive care medicine and a consultant at the Royal London, said his own intensive care staff are having to care for far more sick patients. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there would usually be a ratio of one fully-trained intensive care nurse for each patient in a unit but staff are becoming increasingly stretched. ""Right now we are diluting down to one [intensive care] nurse to three [patients] and filling those gaps with untrained staff and in some instances doctors helping nurses deliver their care... and we're even facing diluting that further to one in four,"" he said. All of the UK is now under strict virus curbs, with Wales, Northern Ireland and most of Scotland also in lockdown, and vaccinations are progressing across the devolved nations.

"This video can not be played Trump has tweeted a video finally condemning the Capitol rioters US President Donald Trump has been allowed to Tweet again, after being locked out of his account for 12 hours. Posting a more conciliatory message, he refrained from reiterating false claims of voter fraud. Twitter said that it would ban Mr Trump ""permanently"" if he breached the platform's rules again. The move from Twitter puts clear water between it and Facebook, which suspended him ""indefinitely"" on Thursday. Twitter has instead given the outgoing president a final warning. Earlier on Thursday, the popular gaming platform Twitch also placed an indefinite ban on Mr Trump's channel, which he has used for rally broadcasts. Mr Trump tweeted several message on Wednesday, calling the people who stormed Capitol Hill ""patriots"". He also said ""We love you."" This video can not be played When a mob stormed the US capitol A spokesperson for Twitter said: ""After the Tweets were removed and the subsequent 12-hour period expired, access to @realDonaldTrump was restored. ""Any future violations of the Twitter Rules, including our Civic Integrity or Violent Threats policies, will result in permanent suspension of the @realDonaldTrump account."" Earlier in the day, the president was suspended from Facebook and Instagram. That suspension will be reviewed after the transition of power to Joe Biden on 20 January. The social network had originally imposed a 24-hour ban after the US Capitol attack. Facebook's chief, Mark Zuckerberg, wrote that the risks of allowing Mr Trump to post ""are simply too great"". Mr Zuckerberg said Facebook had removed the president's posts ""because we judged that their effect - and likely their intent - would be to provoke further violence"". Allow Facebook content?

He said it was clear Mr Trump intended to undermine the transfer of power to President-elect Joe Biden. ""Therefore, we are extending the block we have placed on his Facebook and Instagram accounts indefinitely and for at least the next two weeks until the peaceful transition of power is complete,"" he wrote. Mr Trump's favoured platform, Twitter, suspended the president for 12 hours on Wednesday. The company said it required the removal of three tweets for ""severe violations of our Civic Integrity policy"". It said the president's account would remain locked for good if the tweets were not removed. Twitter has now confirmed the offending tweets have been removed, and he is free to tweet again. LIVE: Biden victory confirmed after deadly attack on Capitol Trumpâs Twitter endgame What does a deadly day mean for Trump's legacy? Snapchat also stopped Mr Trump from creating new posts, but did not say if or when it would end the ban. YouTube also removed Wednesday's video. The president's supporters stormed the seat of US governmentand clashed with police, leading to the death of one woman. The violence brought to a halt congressional debate over Democrat Joe Biden's election win. In the House and Senate chambers, Republicans were challenging the certification of November's election results. This video can not be played ""We will never give up, we will never concede"", Trump tells supporters Before the violence, President Trump had told supporters on the National Mall in Washington that the election had been stolen.

"British Gas engineers have begun a five-day strike from Thursday in a dispute over new contracts. Thousands of staff have walked out in response to an attempt by the firm to push through pay cuts by threatening to fire workers, union GMB said. It accused Centrica owner British Gas of provoking the strike. Centrica said it had done everything it could to avoid a strike, adding it would prioritise vulnerable households and emergencies during the walkout. Justin Bowden, GMB national secretary, said: ""GMB members from Land's End to John O'Groats have stayed home, stayed safe and supported the first national gas strike in a decade. ""The months and months of fire and rehire pay cut threats from British Gas CEO Chris O'Shea have provoked thousands and thousands of GMB engineers and call centre staff to strike, the only option left to them by a business that made Â£901m operating profit yet still plans to sack them because they won't accept the scale of cuts it demands,"" he added. Some British Gas workers have taken to social media to voice their support for the strike. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

A Centrica spokeswoman said: ""We've done everything we can with the GMB to avoid industrial action. ""While we've made great progress with our other unions, sadly the GMB leadership seems intent on causing disruption to customers during the coldest weekend of the year, amid a global health crisis and in the middle of a national lockdown,"" she said. ""We have strong contingency plans in place to ensure we will still be there for customers who really need us."" Almost 90% of GMB members voted for industrial action in a ballot of 9,000 members last month in response to an attempt by Centrica to cut some salaries by up to 10%, the union said. In total, more than 7,500 staff could walk out, although Centrica said GMB had committed to ensure emergency callouts were not affected, adding that it also had contractors that it could call upon. In June, Centrica said it planned to to cut around 5,000 jobsto ""arrest the decline"" of the company. It has been losing customers to rivals and, in February last year, blamed a big loss in 2019 on the energy price cap and falling gas prices. Centrica has since said the coronavirus crisis has shown how the company could be ""agile and responsive"". Commenting on the strike, Centrica said 83% of workers had already accepted its new terms and conditions, which it said protected base pay and pensions. ""This shows most of our people understand that our business needs to change because customer needs are changing,"" the spokeswoman said. ""GMB's mandate for strike action is weak; they are fighting against modernisation and changes which will help to protect well-paid jobs in the long-term and are doing so at a time that our country needs everyone to pull together.""

"Supporters of the president hold a post-election 'Stop The Steal' protest in Atlanta President Trump alleged ""fraud"" even while votes were still being counted - the culmination of a strategy at least months in the making. In the early hours of a frosty November morning in Connecticut, 49-year-old Candy snuggled into her bed after a long night shift. She immediately unlocked her phone - and began scrolling through her social media feed, as she does most nights. But this was different - it was election night. The result was still hanging in the balance. Candy scrolled, catching up on the night's news while waiting for her favoured candidate to speak out. And just after 1 a.m., he did: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

She was frustrated and she wanted to do something - so when one of her best friends invited her to join a Facebook group called Stop the Steal, she jumped at the opportunity. ""The Democrats have said since the beginning of all this Covid stuff that they're going to do whatever it takes to get Trump out - and I think that they have succeeded,"" she later said. LISTEN NOW:Trending from the BBC World Service Candy was expecting this. For months allegations of ""rigged elections"" and ""voter fraud"" have been punctuating her Facebook feed. And she's not the only American who had been exposed to voting disinformation for months before polling day. Research by the BBC's Anti-disinformation unit reveals that disinformation about voter fraud has been plugged by influential accounts on social media repeatedly, for months. And it came from the very top. President Trump first started tweeting allegations of fraud as far back as April. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Trump made claims of voter fraud back in 2016 - after an election he won. But this time around, the evidence suggests many more people have been seeing unsubstantiated claims all over their social media feeds for weeks. Candy is just one of them. Hundreds of thousands joined big Facebook groups under the ""Stop the Steal"" banner. One of the groups that sprung up after the US Election Our research found that influential right-wing accounts were instrumental in amplifying these claims - and were frequently retweeted by President Trump. That includes a number of figures with big followings who have gone on to be involved in a protest movement centred around the unsubstantiated idea of a ""rigged"" election. On election night the hashtag #StoptheSteal sprung up on Twitter after the first of many misleading videos about voter fraud went viral. The video showed a poll watcher being denied entry to a Philadelphia polling station. It has almost two million views on Twitter, and was shared by multiple pro-Trump accounts. We investigated the video shortly after it was posted. The man who features in it was asked to wait outside by officials - with a woman telling him that his poll-watching certificate was not valid at that particular polling station. The video was authentic and, as it turns out, the woman was wrong. There was confusion over the rules. Poll watchers used to only be allowed into a particular station in Philadelphia, but they can now visit multiple sites across the city. The situation was later clarified and the man was later allowed into the station, and given an apology. None of that was reflected in the video of course - and the hashtag had already gone viral. The slogan went viral on election night The Stop the Steal slogan was then used by those setting up large Facebook groups which, since election night, have cumulatively amassed more than a million members. Several of these groups have been removed after users posted threats of violence and calls for ""civil war"". They have become a hotbed for more misleading videos and false claims - similar to that incident in Philadelphia - which have flooded social media feeds of people like Candy. How I talk to the victims of conspiracy theories How a misleading post made it to Trump's Twitter 'QAnon might affect how my friends vote' ""They were saying that we started the group to try to start riots in different places in the country, which wasn't true,"" Candy tells me, increasingly angry about her Stop the Steal Facebook group being closed down. Candy, along with most of the members of these groups, aren't calling for violence. She says she is simply pursuing what she thinks is the truth. ""Everybody was just out there putting out what fraud they were seeing going on with the election,"" she says. Candy pictured with a Donald Trump cardboard cut-out She admits to me that she spends too much time on Facebook - and though she says she doesn't quite trust what she sees on the social network, at the same time it has been her main source of election information. She mentioned a number of debunked or evidence-less claims: thatcertain types of pens were handed out that would invalidate ballots, or that ballots were being dumped or ripped up. We investigated dozens of claims circulating online turned out to be made up, untrue or impossible to prove. One example: A man said that he had thrown away Trump ballots in Wisconsin in a post that went viral on Facebook. But it turns out that he lives in the suburbs of Detroit - in a totally different state, Michigan. The man, a 32-year-old butcher, revealed his real identity to BBC News, and insisted he had nothing to do with counting any ballots - in Wisconsin or anywhere else. The post, he said, was simply a joke. There's no concrete evidence of votes - for any candidate - being thrown away or ripped up. The claims keep coming. ""I saw a video somebody posted that a man had discovered that his wife voted this year,"" Candy says, ""but she died in 2017."" Again, we've looked into these allegations. Many claims about dead voters have beenrevealed as misinformation or mistaken identitiesby the authorities. We found one case where a living person accidently submitted an absentee ballot that was sent to a dead parent. There are others where the voters in question died before the election. Authorities in Michigan confirmed that when that is the case, the vote is thrown out. In the background - and occasional foreground - of this election is a series of increasingly popular conspiracy theories that encourage the idea everything is rigged, suspicious and not as it seems. Professor Whitney Phillips of Syracuse University says the QAnon conspiracy theory may explain in part why these rumours about voting have spread like wildfire. This is the baseless belief that President Trump is waging a secret war against Satanic paedophiles. What is QAnon? QAnon flag features at recent Stop the Steal protests ""Journalists and commentators have focused on the satanic child sex ring elements of the theory,"" she says. ""But buried within that narrative was a deeper 'deep state' narrative,"" which caused Trump supporters to question and doubt almost everything. Twitter hides Trump's first tweet of the day In her view, even before the first vote was cast there were ""breadcrumbs and a whole narrative framework"" that the Democrats were going to steal the election. Her greatest fear is not about violence on the streets. She doesn't think people like Candy who join Stop the Steal groups are going to riot because of fake news online. Instead, Whitney Philips and other experts I speak to worry about the slow, gradual erosion of people's faith in democracy.

"Olly Stephens was stabbed to death in Emmer Green in Reading on Sunday Three teenagers have been charged with murder and conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm after a boy, 13, was stabbed to death in Reading. Oliver Stephens, known as Olly, was pronounced dead at Bugs Bottom fields, Emmer Green, on Sunday. Two boys, aged 13 and 14, and a girl, aged 13, will appear in Reading Magistrates' Court on Thursday. Two other boys, also aged 13, have been released on bail, with strict conditions, until 1 February. The girl has also been charged with perverting the course of justice. In a statement, Oliver's family said: ""An Olly-sized hole has been left in our hearts."" His parents said their son was ""an enigma"", and having both autism and suspected pathological demand avoidance meant ""he became a challenge we never shied away from"". The family described the ordeal as ""every parents' worst nightmare"". They also sought to highlight those who helped at the scene, including ""a Good Samaritan that tried valiantly to save Oliver"", an off-duty doctor who offered help, and the emergency services. Officers were called just before 16:00 GMT on Sunday following reports of an attack in fields on the boundary of Emmer Green and Caversham Heights. Parents laying flowers at nearby Highdown School called the killing ""utterly senseless"" and said their children who attended school with Olly were ""devastated"". Det Supt Kevin Brown urged anyone with information to contact police and not to share any images or footage on social media. ""This continues to be a very difficult time for the family of Olly. Our thoughts remain with them,"" he said. ""The Stephens family appreciate all of the kindness shown to them but they have asked that their privacy is respected at this very difficult time.""

"People with non-visible disabilities such as autism or Parkinson's disease face a ""shocking disparity"" when applying for a blue badge parking permit, a BBC investigation has found. Scores of councils have lower approval rates for non-visible disabilities applications compared to those for physical impairments. Non-visible disability applications began in England in August 2019. The Department for Transport (DfT) said it would review their impact. Applications for people with cognitive impairments were already considered in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The BBC Shared Data Unit obtained Freedom of Information Act (FOI) responses from the 216 upper-tier councils across the UK. Of the 109 councils who gave full responses, eight out of 10 had higher approval rates for people with physical impairments.  For ten of those councils, the difference was greater than 50 percentage points. James Taylor, from the disability charity Scope, said: ""This new data shows a shocking disparity between the allocations of blue badges to people with invisible and visible impairments. ""Councils need to understand the devastating impact their negative decision can have."" The National Autistic Society said the results showed how important it was for councils to improve training to ensure staff understood when people should be entitled to a ""lifeline"" blue badge. Blue badge permits help disabled people to access goods and services, by allowing them to park close to their destination. The new rules, described as ""the biggest change to the scheme in nearly 50 years,external"" when introduced by the Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, widened the eligibility criteria to ensure people with non-visible disabilities were not disadvantaged. The scheme was changed to include disabilities such as autism, dementia and anxiety. Michelle Woodward said the application process was ""not friendly"" Former magistrates' court manager Michelle Woodward, who has relapsing remittingmultiple sclerosis,external(MS), had her application for a blue badge and an appeal refused by Oxfordshire County Council in February 2019 before non-visible disabilities applications were introduced. ""It was outrageous at first,"" she said. ""Someone must have said to me it would be straightforward, otherwise I wouldn't have put myself through that stress. ""When I originally applied the guidance said not to mention any toilet issues. ""This was impossible for me because MS has affected my bladder as well as my walking and endurance. ""So when I hit the send button of my online application I instantly received a refusal email."" She could not re-apply for six months but when she did, she successfully did so under the new guidance. She said: ""I found it very difficult navigating the whole online application system. ""Unfortunately, MS affects your brain power. So I had trouble working my way round the form, trying to attach it. Sometimes I have to get my husband to do it. ""It's not friendly. ""How many disabled customers are the shops losing because we can't use them? ""I feel like I'm not being incorporated with the town. I've lived in Oxford for two years but I can't really familiarise myself with the city. ""There are people worse off than me, how do they cope?"" Tim Nicholls, head of policy and public affairs at the National Autistic Society, said: ""These figures highlight the postcode lottery that has developed around blue badges. ""This must change. Getting a blue badge when you need one shouldn't depend on where you live."" The removal of accessible parking bays next to shops and amenities ""overnight, without any consultation"" to allow for social distancing during the Covid-19 pandemic had also had a ""massive impact"" on disabled people, Scope said. The DfT said its review of the new criteria would include considering feedback from users of the online application service. But people who had applied online told the BBC of the ""trauma"" of having to produce evidence of their disabilities to be scrutinised, and the difficulty of completing the form. In addition, they spoke of their reluctance to send original personal identity documents such as birth certificates in the post. Mr Nicholls said a blue badge could facilitate journeys with a carer for someone with autism who may not be able to understand or react to the dangers of the road. The permit could also help someone with autism overcome their anxiety over not finding a parking space or things going wrong on a trip, which could stop them from leaving the house entirely, he said. Paul Edwards, director of clinical services at Dementia UK, said: ""These lower blue badge approval rates for people with non-visible disabilities show how some of the most vulnerable people continue to be left behind. ""For both family carers and people with dementia still able to drive, a blue badge permit could help to minimise any safety risks by allowing closer parking to entrances. It can also decrease feelings of anxiety around going out."" Crohns and Colitis UK said access to toilets was an extremely important issue for people with Inflammatory Bowel Disease, but many callers to its helpline had been refused a blue badge permit by their local council. Councils with the largest disparity between approval rates said they had followed government guidance and helped applicants provide supporting medical evidence. Councillor David Renard, transport spokesperson for the Local Government Association, which represents councils' interests, said local authorities wanted to make sure services and communities were as accessible as possible. About 2.3 million disabled people in England have a blue badge, according tolatest data,external. Some 28,000 blue badges were issued to people with non-visible disabilities in England in the first 12 months, our investigation found.

"Work to get pupils connected in Wolverhampton is well under way There are concerns some schools in lockdown could be inundated with pupils without laptops after a change to the vulnerable pupil list. Pupils are learning remotely in England after schools were closed on Tuesday to all but children of key workers and those deemed vulnerable. But those without laptops or space to study are now eligible to attend school, under government guidance. Heads' union, NAHT, said the move could reduce the effect of the shutdown. Schools were ordered to close to most pupils as a way of limiting the spread of the virus. National Association of Head Teachers general secretary Paul Whiteman said demand for key worker and vulnerable places in schools had risen substantially since the last school shutdown. Nearly a third of the 2,000 head teachers who joined an online union meeting on Wednesday afternoon reported having between 20 and 30% of pupils in school, the NAHT said. Mr Whiteman said: ""It is critical that key worker child school places are only used when absolutely necessary to truly reduce numbers and spread of the virus. ""We have concern that the government has not supplied enough laptops for all the children without them and so has made lack of internet access a vulnerable criteria - only adding to numbers still in school. What's happening with schools across the country? Schools closed with heaviest of hearts, says Gove We've all seen this coming, say angry heads How to be the school of Mum and Dad (again) ""It is important that all vulnerable pupils have access to a school place, but the government must provide laptops and internet access for every pupil that needs one, so that they can access home learning to take some of the strain off the demand for school places. ""Nearly half of head teachers who we polled during a webcast on Wednesday evening said that had received fewer than 10% of the laptops they'd requested. ""It is essential that this is rectified immediately, so that we can keep school attendance figures at a level which will have the desired impact on getting transmission rates under control."" Jane Girt, head teacher of Carlton Bolling College in Bradford, said the rule change could leave her having to accommodate an extra 200 pupils on top of those already on the key worker and vulnerable children list. She told BBC News that having so many pupils in school would ""defeat the object"" of closing amid the England-wide lockdown. Mrs Girt said her secondary, which has more than 1,500 students, had received 261 laptops from the government since March but about 50% of pupils were sharing a device with another family member. The prime minister told MPs on Wednesday that 560,000 devices had been given out to schools in 2020 and a further 50,000 so far this week. And Gavin Williamson reiterated that those without access to remote learning via digital devices could attend school. He said: ""Schools are much better prepared to deliver online learning, with the delivery of hundreds of thousands of devices at breakneck speed, data support and high quality video lessons."" But Ofcom estimates there are up to 1.5m pupils without digital devices in their homes, on which they can learn. Amanda Bailey, director of the child poverty commission in north-east England, said pupils without internet access tended to be concentrated in disadvantaged areas and this meant some schools would be ""largely fully open"", she said. ""And we know that the most deprived communities are the ones most vulnerable to the health impact of the pandemic,"" she added. ""Our main concerns are that we're now nine months into this situation and we're still talking about families not having sufficient access to digital devices or data or the internet."" SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? Labour Councillor Beverley Momenabadi, Wolverhampton's champion for digital innovation, said the guidance massively expands the number of children who are entitled to go into school. She said although plans to support those needing access while self-isolating in her city are at an advanced stage, with rental schemes being accessed and donations sought, the new lockdown changes the game completely. She called for a national plan for the transition to remote learning. Councillor Momenabadi said: ""Even after Gavin Williamson's statement in the Commons, children across the country are still waiting for that national plan. ""And even on the devices they've said will arrive; how will these  be distributed, when will they arrive, will they arrive in time to ensure that no child misses out on their education?""

"Planned reforms of the controversial leasehold system in England are set to clamp down on high costs when extending a lease. The government's proposals should help those with shorter leases fearing bills of many thousands of pounds. Former council tenants who bought their homes in the 1980s are likely to be among those who could benefit. Campaigners gave the complex proposals, which could affect up to four million homes, a guarded welcome. Some have dubbed the system as ""fleecehold"", owing to issues over escalating rents and high charges. While they welcome protections for leaseholders in the future, many believe they should be paid compensation for unjustified charges and rents in the past. Someone who owns a property outright, including the land it is built on, is a freeholder. With a leasehold, the person owns a lease, which gives them the right to use the property. But they still have to get their landlord's permission for any work or changes to their homes. When a leasehold flat or house is first sold, a lease is granted for a fixed period of time, typically between 99 and 125 years - but sometimes up to 999 years. People may extend their lease or buy the freehold, but this can be complicated and expensive and involve legal fees. Leasehold house owners are also often charged expensive ground rent as well as fees if they want to make changes to their homes. A leasehold house can also be difficult to sell. When a homebuyer purchases a leasehold property, they do not possess it outright. Instead they gain the right to occupy it for a set number of years. They can extend their lease by applying to their freeholder and negotiating a fee. Part of this fee is called the marriage value - representing the increase in the value of the property once the lease has been extended. 'Absurd' lease pricing should stop say campaigners Court threat to housebuilders over leasehold âtrapâ 'Fire patrols at our flats cost us Â£500,000' Under the government's plans, the marriage value will be abolished - following recommendations by the Law Commission. Ministers say this will make charges more transparent when it comes to extending a lease. ""Across the country people are struggling to realise the dream of owning their own home but find the reality of being a leaseholder far too bureaucratic, burdensome and expensive,"" said Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick. The Leasehold Knowledge Partnership, which advises leaseholders, welcomed some of the moves but said it needed more details on how the new calculations would work, how much an extension would cost, and whether it would be cheaper for everyone. Katie Kendrick saw the bill for buying her freehold rocket Mr Jenrick claimed that there would be savings of between Â£8,000 and Â£9,000 for the average leaseholder buying their freehold. He said the government was working with the housing sector to develop commonhold as a potential alternative to leasehold in flat purchases in the years ahead - where flat-owners held the freehold to their property, but blocks were jointly-owned and managed. He said he was working towards a ""widespread take-up of commonhold over the course of this Parliament"", which would signal what the future should look like ""beyond leasehold"". Paediatric nurse Katie Kendrick was told she could buy the freehold on her Cheshire home for between Â£2,000 and Â£4,000 two years later, only for it to be sold on to an investment company which quoted her more than Â£13,000. Her experience led her to become one of the founders of the National Leasehold Campaign, describing the system as a relic of a feudal age. She said the government's plans marked ""the start of the end for leasehold"". However, the campaign called for the changes to be made quickly to get many leaseholders out of the existing limbo. The initial part of the plan will see leaseholders given the opportunity to extend their lease for 990 years - reducing risks of the property becoming more difficult to sell. Under current rules, leaseholdersâ¯of housesâ¯can only extend their lease once for 50 years with a ground rent. This compares to leaseholders of flats who can extend as often as they wish at a zero ground rent for 90 years.â¯ The government wants legislation in the current session of Parliament to allow house and flat leaseholders to extend their lease to a new standard 990 years with the ground rent set at zero.â¯ Although developers say leasehold can work for many people, the government has already said that ground rents should be set to zero for new leases. Under its new proposals, these rules should also apply to retirement leasehold properties, for homes built specifically for older people. That move was welcomed by Propertymark - the professional body for estate agency staff, which has campaigned on the issue. ""While we welcome the government's initiative to reduce ground rents to zero for all new retirement properties, we would argue this needs to be extended to all retirement properties to create a level playing field,"" said its chief policy adviser Mark Hayward.

"Ryanair is making big cuts to its flight schedule from 21 January in response to the latest Covid lockdowns. It warned that few, if any, flights would operate to or from Ireland or the UK from the end of January until ""draconian"" restrictions were removed. Customers hit by the cancellations will be advised by email of entitlements to free moves or refunds, it said. Ryanair also cut its full year traffic forecast from currently ""below 35 million"" to 26-30 million passengers. The airline said that new Covid restrictions could reduce traffic in February and March to as little as 500,000 passengers each month. It expects January traffic to fall below 1.25 million. It said it did not expect these latest flight cuts and further traffic reductions to materially affect its net loss for the year to 31 March 2021, since many of the flights would have been loss-making. Ryanair hit out at Irish and UK governments for the latest lockdowns. ""The WHO have previously confirmed that governments should do everything possible to avoid brutal lockdowns, because lockdowns 'do not get rid of the virus',"" Ryanair said in a statement. ""Ireland's Covid-19 travel restrictions are already the most stringent in Europe, and so these new flight restrictions are inexplicable and ineffective when Ireland continues to operate an open border between the Republic and the North of Ireland."" It called on the Irish Government to accelerate the rollout of vaccines. ""The fact that the Danish Government, with a similar five million population, has already vaccinated 10 times more citizens than Ireland shows that emergency action is needed to speed Covid vaccinations in Ireland."" Rival low-cost carrier Norwegian said its traffic figures had been hit heavily by the pandemic, with customer numbers down 94% compared to the same period the previous year. In December, 129,664 customers flew with Norwegian, with the capacity and total passenger traffic both down by 98%. ""2020 has been a very challenging year and we now find ourselves fighting for survival,"" said Jacob Schram, chief executive of Norwegian.

"Sarah Bingham said she is a match donor for her daughter Ariel and eldest son Noah (far right) A mother with two children who need kidney transplants said she wishes she could help both of them, but can only donate one organ. Sarah Bingham's son Noah, 20, and daughter Ariel, 16, have the same rare genetic condition. Mrs Bingham, 48, is a donor match for her children and said her maternal instinct is to donate to both of them. But her organ was always due to go to her daughter and two family friends are matches for her son. Her husband Darryl, 49, is not a match, so cannot be a donor for their children. Both Noah and Ariel have nephronophthisis, which causes inflammation and scarring to the kidneys. Mrs Bingham, of Hexham, Northumberland, said although her son is ""very poorly"", he undergoes regular dialysis and is in a stable condition. Her daughter's kidney function ""has been deteriorating more in the last year"" and she will probably need a transplant first. Mrs Bingham said: ""I was all set to give a kidney to my daughter and then my son went into renal failure and he also needs a kidney. Obviously, I've only got one that I can donate. ""The renal teams don't push you [to make a decision], because you're putting yourself on the line to donate a kidney. ""You have to make that call yourself, but obviously as a mum when you've got two children who both need kidney transplants and you've expected to give your kidney to one, and suddenly the other one needs one as well, you feel this dilemma."" Noah Bingham is in a stable condition thanks to regular kidney dialysis Problems began in 2016 when Ariel started to feel constantly tired. Her fatigue was initially put down to exam stress, but tests at Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary found she had the kidney condition. Mrs Bingham was told she would be a suitable donor for Ariel when the time came. Then, in 2019, Noah became ill and was diagnosed with the same condition. He is stable, but would need to put on weight to undergo a transplant. The couple have another son Casper, 12, who is being tested to see if he also has the condition. Darryl Bingham is not a suitable match for his two eldest children Prof John Sayer, a kidney specialist at Newcastle's Freeman Hospital who is treating Noah, said nephronophthisis affects about one in 100,000 people. ""There's clearly a dilemma because there's a shortage of donors for patients needing kidney transplants. ""But kidney failure itself is not rare. There are 4,500 people across the country waiting for a transplant."" He added patients often face a ""gruelling and terrifying"" wait of about three years for a donor organ.

"Supermarket giant Sainsbury's has reported a bumper Christmas, with sales up 9.3% for the festive trading period. More customers bought their food online than ever before, it said. In the 10 days leading up to Christmas, it delivered 1.1 million online orders, twice last year's number. ""Many customers had to change their Christmas plans at the last minute and we sold smaller turkeys and more lamb and beef than normal,"" said chief executive Simon Roberts. Sainsbury's Christmas trading period covered the nine weeks from 1 November 2020 to 2 January 2021. For the 15 weeks to 2 January, like-for-like sales, which strip out the impact of new store openings, were up 8.6%. Shoppers told not to buy more than normal Supermarket websites struggle amid new lockdown ""We now expect, after forgoing business rates relief of Â£410m, to report underlying profit before tax of at least Â£330m in the financial year to March 2021,"" the supermarket said. That is down from the previous year's figure of Â£586m. Sainsbury's has delivered bumper festive sales. It's invested heavily in boosting online capacity to keep up with the soaring demand. Supermarkets have struggled to make money from doing online deliveries, but Sainsbury's says its operation has become more efficient and profitability has improved. As volumes have increased, there are more orders in every van delivering to a smaller radius of customers. Click-and-collect is a lot cheaper to do than home deliveries. And this accounted for about a quarter of online sales in the final week. Argos generated more than half its sales from online well before the pandemic. More than 300 Argos counters are now inside Sainsbury's supermarkets, making it easy for people to pick up goods and gifts. Its fast-track delivery service can deliver to customers' homes and collection points within hours and this has seen growth of 62%. This is a business that's been well placed to benefit from the huge shift to digital this Christmas. Christmas and New Year celebrations were constrained by coronavirus restrictions, which limited the number of people and households allowed to meet up. Sainsbury's said that while people had smaller gatherings, they still treated themselves, with sales of the supermarket's premium Taste the Difference range up 11%. Premium champagne sales were up 52%, it added,echoing similar findings by rival Morrisons. ""People did more home baking than usual, with mincemeat sales up 24%. Customers still wanted New Year's Eve at home to feel special and we sold a record number of steaks,"" Sainsbury's said. Sales of groceries, general merchandise and clothing were stronger than expected throughout the quarter, particularly since the start of England's second national lockdown, it added. Clothing benefited from better-than-anticipated full-price sales, driven by customers shopping earlier for Christmas and changes to the supermarket's Black Friday trading strategy. Separate figures issued by discount retailer B&M indicated that it too had a good Christmas, with like-for-like revenues at its UK stores up 21.1% year-on-year in the 13 weeks to 26 December. ""With our combination of exceptional value and convenient out-of-town locations, we are confident that our business model will prove highly relevant to the needs of customers in 2021,"" said chief executive Simon Arora.

"PM says he has ""no doubt"" there is enough supply to vaccinate the first four priority groups by 15 February NHS CEO Sir Simon Stevens says there will be a ""huge acceleration"" in the vaccination programme over the coming weeks Army logistics expert Brigadier Phil Prosser says his mission is to get vaccines ""in arms not on shelves"" A further 1,162 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is being rolled out to hundreds of GP-run vaccination centres in England Nearly 1.5 million people across the UK have now had their first dose, Boris Johnson says A weekly doorstep round of applause returns at 20:00 GMT - under the new name of Clap for Heroes For the first time, Sweden is recommending face masks on public transport during rush hours Japan announces a new state of emergency for Tokyo and surrounding areas as infections reach record levels Global virus cases have exceeded 87m and nearly 1.9m have died during the pandemic, according to figures tracked by Johns Hopkins University Edited by Marie Jackson That's all from the live page today, thank you for joining us. Today's updates were the work of Alice Evans, Joseph Lee, Lauren Turner, Emma Owen, Mary O'Connor, Richard Morris, George Wright and Jennifer Meierhans. This page was edited by James Clarke. We'll be back tomorrow to bring you all the very latest. We'll be pausing our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic in a few minutes' time. If you're just catching up, here are some of the latest developments: Following the release of the official daily figures on coronavirus cases, deaths and other statistics, here's a look at the coronavirus epidemic in the UK, through graphs and charts: Alison HoltSocial affairs correspondent Hospital managers in areas with high numbers of Covid cases
say they are talking to residential and nursing homes about taking
patients to ease pressures. So how will this work? In England, each area should now have designated places with
high levels of infection control to take Covid positive patients who no longer
need hospital care. These beds might be in a separate care home â so called
âhot homesâ- or in the wing of an existing home, which operates with different
staff from the rest of the building. Many care providers have been reluctant to
even consider such a role after the high number of care home deaths in the
first wave. One care homeowner, who is taking Covid patients, says he
has some empty beds but with the new variant of the virus spreading so easily,
he wants his staff vaccinated as a priority. In addition, concerns over whether
homes are insured if they take Covid patients still havenât been addressed. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has just led a Downing Street news conference,
alongside NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens and
Brigadier Phil Prosser. Hereâs a quick recap of the key points: Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Staff at St George's Hospital in Tooting, south-west London Strong words from NHS England chief executive Sir Simon
Stevens about conspiracy theories that hospitals are not busy. He calls it an
insult to staff. One figure that is often used is the fact that around one in 10 beds are available â that is actually more than last year. But that does not tell you the full story Hospitals have only been able to achieve this by
cancelling planned care â that includes routine treatments like hip and knee
operations but also, in some places, urgent cancer care. More intensive care beds have been opened â there are a
fifth more than there were at the start of November. But there is not a space or the specialist staff to run
these. So staff are being redeployed and wards turned into
emergency intensive care areas. One in three patients in UK hospitals now has Covid â in
some areas it is as high as one in two. This is stretching the health service to the limit. NHS England's chief executive Simon Stevens was earlier asked about concerns from NHS staff about people who falsely claim the virus is ""fake news"" and that hospitals are empty. In his response calling the claims an ""insult"" to NHS staff, Sir Simon also praised media reporting on the real pressures hospitals are facing, including the BBC's. The BBC's Medical editor, Fergus Walsh, hasreturned to an intensive care unit at University College Hospital, in central London. It was the same intensive care unit that he first visited in April, during the first peak of the pandemic. Shell-shocked staff have told of the physical and mental toll the pandemic is having on them. ""My emotions are all over the place. Scared, sad, petrified, worried,"" one ICU nurse said. This video can not be played ICU hospital staff: 'Scared, sad, petrified, worried' Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online These new life-saving Covid drugs,tocilizumab and sarilumab,may be hard to pronounce but they are easy to
give. And the NHS already has stocks of them, meaning the sickest patients can
receive doses immediately, to save hundreds more lives. This treatment
breakthrough couldn't come soon enough. There are more than 30,000 Covid
patients in hospitals around the UK - far more than during the peak of last
April. In trials, it has been found the new drugs cut deaths by a quarter,
saving around one extra life for every 12 people treated. They also speed up
recovery and reduce the length of time that critically-ill patients need to
spend in intensive care by about a week The next question comes from the Evening Standard's Sophia Sleigh. She says London's hospitals are ""staring into the abyss"" , and less than two weeks off being overwhelmed by the surge in the number of coronavirus patients. ""Why wasn't more done to stop us ending up here?"" she asks. Sir Simon answers by saying the UK's four chief medical officers acted to move the UK's risk level up to level five on Monday - which reflected the strain on the NHS. He adds that the London Nightingale field hospital expects to open to patients next week - and says it will also be used as a vaccination centre. In response to Sleigh's second question, about how and when life might return back to normal, the PM says ""there will be the chance to look at some relaxations of restrictions"" by 15 February. However, he says this will only be the case if the vaccination programme goes ahead with the speed expected, and no further new variants of the virus develop by then. Johnson says reopening schools will ""certainly be the priority"" in any review of lockdown rules. ""I do think things will be much better by the spring,"" he adds. That brings an end to today's press conference. Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent I was struck today by the language, tone and palpable anger from the prime minister and Sir Simon Stevens about the drivel that floats around on the internet about the pandemic. The prime minister said those who've turned up outside hospitals suggesting Coronavirus is a scam should ""grow up."" And Sir Simon, whose public manner is normally measured and reserved, is clearly furious at some of the stuff he has seen on social media. ""It's a lie"" he said pointedly at claims hospitals are actually quite quiet and ""most obviously untrue"". Instead, he said, people should rely on established media sources - as he name checked ITV, Sky News, Channel 4 and the BBC. Will James of Reuters asks Sir Simon if he can guarantee people who have had their first Pfizer jab will get their second. Sir Simon confirms they will get a second jab. He says the gap between vaccines also means it can be offered to many more people. James also asks the PM for the final toll that will be seen by spring. Boris Johnson says he cannot give that number - but that it will be ""tragically far too high"". ""Every death is a tragedy, we mourn every person we lose in this pandemic,"" he adds. The ""overall toll"" will depend on the success of the vaccination programme - and also on everyone working together to stop transmission of the virus and protect the NHS. Chris Smith of The Times asks if Covid and other patients will be able to receive a normal standard of care in the NHS. Secondly, he asks if the government will move to younger age groups to make sure 13 million people end up being vaccinated. Simon Stevens of the NHS says ""uptake is likely to be high"" of the Covid vaccine, following on from high numbers of people taking the flu jab this winter. He says ""people have heard that message"" on the vaccine and the NHS is getting a ""good response"" when people are being offered the vaccine. He adds that the situation in London is ""very serious"" following the new variant of Covid, saying NHS hospitals in London are receiving 800 Covid patients a day, which is the equivalent of St Thomas' Hospital. Hospitals are expanding critical care areas so these can be surged when demand is necessary, but he warns ""it is vital that the infection rate now comes under control"". Boris Johnson adds it is ""important"" that the government sets high ""stretching"" targets for vaccination, as the NHS is under ""extreme pressure already"" and high levels of vaccination is what the public wants, to avoid further lockdowns. Johnson says people who claim hospitals are empty 'need to grow up' Victoria Macdonald from Channel 4 asks the prime minister if he regrets not locking down earlier - given that many patients now in hospital will have been infected before Christmas. Boris Johnson says that the government learned of the new variant on 18 December and tier four measures were put in place the next day for the vast bulk of the country. Macdonald also asks about concern from NHS staff about people out there who falsely claim the virus is ""fake news"" and that hospitals are empty. Johnson replies these people ""need to grow up"", saying that we have already heard from Sir Simon how much pressure the NHS is under. We all need to do our bit to protect it, he says. For the vast majority, this means staying home to protect the NHS - and for those invited to take the vaccine, to have the jab. Sir Simon says that if people sneak into a hospital late at night and film an empty corridor, they are responsible for potentially changing behaviour that will kill people. It is an ""insult"" to the intensive care nurse, working 12 hour shifts in the most trying of circumstances, he adds. ""There is nothing more demoralising than having that kind of nonsense spouted when it is obviously untrue,"" says Sir Simon, praising reports on Channel 4, the BBC, ITV and Sky for reporting what is actually going on in hospitals. ITV's Emily Morgan asks the PM to clarify why some GPs have reported not receiving regular supplies of the coronavirus vaccine, despite having capacity to administer doses. The prime minister says ""to the best of my knowledge we are rolling out supplies of both vaccines to GP surgeries"", and repeats his earlier remark - that there will be roughly 1,000 primary care vaccination centres up and running across the country by the end of the week. He insists the supply of both vaccines is being rolled out but adds: ""I won't hide from you - of course, in the early phases, there's going to be lumpiness and bumpiness in the distribution. Today it may be that some GPs aren't getting the consignment that they expected."" Sir Simon adds that today is the first day of the vaccine rollout by GPs - and that with more than a thousand locations for the vaccine to be delivered to on a daily basis, there will be bumps along the road. ""We've just got to have a sense of gathering round to get this thing done as a big team effort, rather than poking and prodding [at small bumps in the road],"" he says. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Lots of detail has been given about how the NHS â working
hand-in-hand with the military â will be able to deliver the vaccines. There will be more local vaccination centres, hospital
hubs and even mass vaccination at sports stadiums. Thousands of extra vaccinators have already been trained
â and thousands more are waiting in the wings. But the biggest hurdle the UK faces is vaccine supply. If it is not available, it cannot be put in arms no
matter how many centres and vaccinators we have. In the long term supply is not going to be a problem â
two vaccines have already been approved and there are encouraging signs others
will follow. But in the short term everything depends on how quickly a
plant in Wrexham can get the vaccine produced by Astrazeneca into vials and
then how quickly the regulator can carry out the safety checks. At the moment there is thought to be only a few million
doses ready for the NHS â with another 15 million or so going through this
system. The target to vaccinate the most at risk groups by mid-February is achievable â but it will require a lot to go right. The BBC's Alex Forsyth asks if Donald Trump was responsible for inciting the storming of Congress in Washington DC. She also asks if the government can deliver in their promises on the vaccine. Boris Johnson says the US has stood for ""freedom"" and ""democracy"". He says what Mr Trump has done, casting doubt on the election result, was ""completely wrong"". He says he condemns anyone who would encourage people to behave the way they did in the Capitol. He says he is ""very pleased"" that democracy has prevailed and Joe Biden is the President-Elect. But he says the purpose of this press conference is to hear more detail on the vaccine roll-out. He adds that on Monday, there will be a further press conference with Matt Hancock giving specific details on the vaccination programme. Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent It is inevitable that part of the politics of a pandemic is the perceived relative performance of different countries. You can pick your metric to make your comparison, and plenty have. The death toll in the UK, and the economic slump, have come in for particular criticism. But the government has, for some time, sought to emphasise how the UK is ahead of the game on vaccinations. The UK was considerably quicker than the EU, for instance, in licencing the first vaccine, from Pfizer-BioNTech. At today's news conference, the Prime Minister has pointed out that the UK has already given more people a first jab for Covid than all the other countries in Europe put together. Sir Simon Stevens, the Chief Executive of the National Health Service in England, added that the UK has jabbed four times as many people as Germany and 300 times more than France. But he acknowledged the scale of the ongoing challenge - trying to vaccinate as many people in the next five weeks as normally happens in five months with the flu jab. One final thought: ministers tend to suggest international comparisons are pointless or premature when the comparisons are less than flattering. They're rather keener on them when the numbers look better. Stephen from Sheffield asks how the government is supporting students In his second question from the public, Johnson is asked how the government is supporting university students at this time. The PM says the government needs to ""look hard"" at the deal students have been given and ""what we can do to support students"" and help them at this very difficult time. Many cannot go back to university except for key practical courses, he notes. The PM says he understands the frustrations - and especially the ""financial frustrations that entails"". He tells the questioner, Stephen, from Sheffield that the issue is being looked at - and that he will be hearing more on this from the education secretary. After hearing from Brigadier Phil Prosser, the Downing Street coronavirus conference is now turning to questions from members of the public. Judith from Leeds asks how early years provision can safely remain open, if primary schools have been deemed a ""vector"" for spreading coronavirus. The PM says the ""whole point is that we believe that schools are safe"", as is, he says, early years provision - but ""we have to look at the overall budget of risk - the overall spread that schools can be involved in"". He adds that it is ""very important"" to keep early years education open to help key workers stay at work during the pandemic. NHS CEO Sir Simon Stevens adds that many health service staff rely on having available childcare - so keeping early years open is ""hugely important to the NHS's effort"" to tackle the virus. Brigadier Phil Prosser, Commander of Military Support to the Vaccine Delivery Programme, is now speaking. He says his team are drawing on their logistics knowledge from previous military operations to help roll out the vaccine. He says the ""mission"" in this case is to ""support the NHS"" and to ""minimise the number of deaths, as quickly and as safely as possible"". But, he warns, the plan has ""many challenges"". The Army has to make sure that vaccines are available across the UK, and in the case of the Pfizer vaccine, have to be stored at -70C. This means ""the plan needs to be agile,"" he adds. He says the Army plans to distribute the vaccine as soon as it receives each dose, adding ""it needs to be in arms, not on shelves"". Something on this scale ""has not been done before, and we are learning as we go"", he says, and the logistics operation is ""unparalleled in its scale and complexity"". It is the equivalent, he says, of setting up a major supermarket chain in less than a month. Â© 2025 BBC.

hand-in-hand with the military â will be able to deliver the vaccines. There will be more local vaccination centres, hospital
hubs and even mass vaccination at sports stadiums. Thousands of extra vaccinators have already been trained
â and thousands more are waiting in the wings. But the biggest hurdle the UK faces is vaccine supply. If it is not available, it cannot be put in arms no
matter how many centres and vaccinators we have. In the long term supply is not going to be a problem â
two vaccines have already been approved and there are encouraging signs others
will follow. But in the short term everything depends on how quickly a
plant in Wrexham can get the vaccine produced by Astrazeneca into vials and
then how quickly the regulator can carry out the safety checks. At the moment there is thought to be only a few million
doses ready for the NHS â with another 15 million or so going through this
system. The target to vaccinate the most at risk groups by mid-February is achievable â but it will require a lot to go right. The BBC's Alex Forsyth asks if Donald Trump was responsible for inciting the storming of Congress in Washington DC. She also asks if the government can deliver in their promises on the vaccine. Boris Johnson says the US has stood for ""freedom"" and ""democracy"". He says what Mr Trump has done, casting doubt on the election result, was ""completely wrong"". He says he condemns anyone who would encourage people to behave the way they did in the Capitol. He says he is ""very pleased"" that democracy has prevailed and Joe Biden is the President-Elect. But he says the purpose of this press conference is to hear more detail on the vaccine roll-out. He adds that on Monday, there will be a further press conference with Matt Hancock giving specific details on the vaccination programme. Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent It is inevitable that part of the politics of a pandemic is the perceived relative performance of different countries. You can pick your metric to make your comparison, and plenty have. The death toll in the UK, and the economic slump, have come in for particular criticism. But the government has, for some time, sought to emphasise how the UK is ahead of the game on vaccinations. The UK was considerably quicker than the EU, for instance, in licencing the first vaccine, from Pfizer-BioNTech. At today's news conference, the Prime Minister has pointed out that the UK has already given more people a first jab for Covid than all the other countries in Europe put together. Sir Simon Stevens, the Chief Executive of the National Health Service in England, added that the UK has jabbed four times as many people as Germany and 300 times more than France. But he acknowledged the scale of the ongoing challenge - trying to vaccinate as many people in the next five weeks as normally happens in five months with the flu jab. One final thought: ministers tend to suggest international comparisons are pointless or premature when the comparisons are less than flattering. They're rather keener on them when the numbers look better. Stephen from Sheffield asks how the government is supporting students In his second question from the public, Johnson is asked how the government is supporting university students at this time. The PM says the government needs to ""look hard"" at the deal students have been given and ""what we can do to support students"" and help them at this very difficult time. Many cannot go back to university except for key practical courses, he notes. The PM says he understands the frustrations - and especially the ""financial frustrations that entails"". He tells the questioner, Stephen, from Sheffield that the issue is being looked at - and that he will be hearing more on this from the education secretary. After hearing from Brigadier Phil Prosser, the Downing Street coronavirus conference is now turning to questions from members of the public. Judith from Leeds asks how early years provision can safely remain open, if primary schools have been deemed a ""vector"" for spreading coronavirus. The PM says the ""whole point is that we believe that schools are safe"", as is, he says, early years provision - but ""we have to look at the overall budget of risk - the overall spread that schools can be involved in"". He adds that it is ""very important"" to keep early years education open to help key workers stay at work during the pandemic. NHS CEO Sir Simon Stevens adds that many health service staff rely on having available childcare - so keeping early years open is ""hugely important to the NHS's effort"" to tackle the virus. Brigadier Phil Prosser, Commander of Military Support to the Vaccine Delivery Programme, is now speaking. He says his team are drawing on their logistics knowledge from previous military operations to help roll out the vaccine. He says the ""mission"" in this case is to ""support the NHS"" and to ""minimise the number of deaths, as quickly and as safely as possible"". But, he warns, the plan has ""many challenges"". The Army has to make sure that vaccines are available across the UK, and in the case of the Pfizer vaccine, have to be stored at -70C. This means ""the plan needs to be agile,"" he adds. He says the Army plans to distribute the vaccine as soon as it receives each dose, adding ""it needs to be in arms, not on shelves"". Something on this scale ""has not been done before, and we are learning as we go"", he says, and the logistics operation is ""unparalleled in its scale and complexity"". It is the equivalent, he says, of setting up a major supermarket chain in less than a month. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played At Fullwell Cross Medical Centre, north London, they are now vaccinating almost 1,000 people a week The Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid vaccine is being rolled out to hundreds of GP-run vaccination sites in England. As part of the biggest vaccination programme in NHS history, the aim is to offer jabs to most care home residents by the end of January. By mid-February, the target is to vaccinate 13 million people in thetop four priority groups. But one surgery visited by the health secretary to promote the initiative said its delivery had been delayed. And leaders in Birmingham have warned stocks of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine are scheduled to run out in the city on Friday, and that it has not received any supplies of the Oxford-Astra Zeneca jab. Aletter,externalsent to Health Secretary Matt Hancock, signed by the Labour leader of Birmingham City Council, Ian Ward, Labour MP Liam Byrne and Conservative MP and former minister Andrew Mitchell, said there was ""currently no clarity on when further supplies will arrive"". They also criticise a lack of clarity over the vaccination programme, and say ""it remains unclear who is responsible for overseeing the vaccination programme in Birmingham, and whom we should hold accountable for progress and delivery"". 1.3 million in UK have had their Covid vaccine Can we really jab our way out of lockdown? What are the UK's new lockdown rules? More than 700 local vaccination sites will administer the Oxford jab. Another 180 GP-led sites, 100 new hospital sites and a pilot scheme involving local pharmacies will open this week. Selected hospitals began administering the vaccine on Monday. Mr Hancock said the jab was now being supplied to GP practices across the country as he visited the Bloomsbury Surgery in central London. The health secretary said he was ""delighted"" care homes residents would begin receiving their first Oxford jabs this week. ""This will ensure the most vulnerable are protected and will save tens of thousands of lives,"" he said. But GP Ammara Hughes, a partner at Bloomsbury Surgery, told broadcasters its first delivery of the jab had been pushed back 24 hours to Thursday. She said: ""It's just more frustrating than a concern because we've got the capacity to vaccinate. And if we had a regular supply - we do have the capacity to vaccinate three to four thousand patients a week."" Standing in front of Dr Hughes's surgery, Mr Hancock said: ""The rate-limiting step is the supply of vaccine. We're working with the companies - both Pfizer and AstraZeneca - to increase the supply."" The surgery said it was continuing to administer the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and had so far received three deliveries of that jab. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said vaccination centres and GP surgeries needed better information about deliveries of the vaccine and how much to expect to arrive. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworthtweeted,externalthat the scenes at the surgery were like something from political comedy The Thick of It, but added: ""Sadly it's no laughing matter."" The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was the first to be approved by the UK's medicines regulator in early December, followed by the British-made Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine four weeks later. Because it does not need to be stored at ultra-cold temperatures like the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, it can be transported and stored more easily, making it simpler to vaccinate housebound people and those in care homes. Around half a million doses of both vaccines are ready to be used this week, with millions more in the pipeline in the coming weeks. Next week,seven major vaccination hubs across Englandare set to begin operating, including the Excel Centre in London and Millennium Point in Birmingham. Broadly, vaccines are being given to the most vulnerable first, as set out ina list of nine high-priority groups,external, covering around 30 million people. They are thought to represent 90-99% of those at risk of dying from Covid-19. Residents in care homes for older adults and their carers 80-year-olds and over and frontline health and social care workers 75-year-olds and over 70-year-olds and over and clinically extremely vulnerable individuals 65-year-olds and over 16- to 64-year-olds with serious underlying health conditions 60-year-olds and over 55-year-olds and over 50-year-olds and over People aged over 80 in hospital, frontline health staff and care home workers have been the first to get the Pfizer jab at designated hospitals hubs and community sites across the UK. Meanwhile, nearly 19,981 second doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech jab were administered between 29 December and 3 January, NHS England said. Dr Nikki Kanani, a GP and medical director for primary care at NHS England, said the vaccination programme was ""off to a strong start with around one million people already vaccinated against coronavirus"". She said GPs, nurses, pharmacists and countless other staff and volunteers had been working ""around the clock"" to be able to launch almost 200 more sites this week. ""We will now be able to protect many more vulnerable people against the virus and faster,"" Dr Kanani said. Nearly a quarter of the over-80s in England have now been vaccinated in total, around 650,000 people, since Margaret Keenan became the first person in the UK to receive a Covid vaccine in December. On Tuesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said1.3 million people in the UK had received their first dose of a vaccine. On Wednesday, another 1,041 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test were recorded, the highest daily death toll since April. And 62,322 new cases were recorded on Wednesday, the highest daily rise since mass testing began. This video can not be played Why the Oxford vaccine matters All of the UK is now under strict virus curbs, with Wales, Northern Ireland and most of Scotland also in lockdown, and vaccinations are progressing across the devolved nations. England is under a third national lockdown - in a bid to prevent the NHS from becoming overwhelmed by the surge in coronavirus cases. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced a new lockdown on Monday - across mainland Scotland, Skye, Arran, Bute and Gighafor the rest of January. Level three restrictions apply in remaining areas of the nation. Wales has been in a national lockdown since 20 December, and schools and colleges in the nationwill remain closed until at least 18 January. In Northern Ireland - which entered a six-week lockdown on 26 December - ""stay at home"" restrictionswill be brought back into law from Friday. As of Monday, about 100,000 people in Scotland had already received a first dose of vaccine.The Scottish NHS hopes to vaccinateeveryone over the age of 50 and younger people with underlying health conditions by the start of May, supplies allowing. More than 35,000 people in Waleshave had a Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, and the Welsh government has said 40,000 doses of the Oxford vaccine will be available within the first two weeks. About 40,000 people in Northern Ireland have received a first dose, and health officials in the nation have said everyone aged over 80 will be immunised within weeks.

"Supermarket giant Sainsbury's has reported a bumper Christmas, with sales up 9.3% for the festive trading period. More customers bought their food online than ever before, it said. In the 10 days leading up to Christmas, it delivered 1.1 million online orders, twice last year's number. ""Many customers had to change their Christmas plans at the last minute and we sold smaller turkeys and more lamb and beef than normal,"" said chief executive Simon Roberts. Sainsbury's Christmas trading period covered the nine weeks from 1 November 2020 to 2 January 2021. For the 15 weeks to 2 January, like-for-like sales, which strip out the impact of new store openings, were up 8.6%. Shoppers told not to buy more than normal Supermarket websites struggle amid new lockdown ""We now expect, after forgoing business rates relief of Â£410m, to report underlying profit before tax of at least Â£330m in the financial year to March 2021,"" the supermarket said. That is down from the previous year's figure of Â£586m. Sainsbury's has delivered bumper festive sales. It's invested heavily in boosting online capacity to keep up with the soaring demand. Supermarkets have struggled to make money from doing online deliveries, but Sainsbury's says its operation has become more efficient and profitability has improved. As volumes have increased, there are more orders in every van delivering to a smaller radius of customers. Click-and-collect is a lot cheaper to do than home deliveries. And this accounted for about a quarter of online sales in the final week. Argos generated more than half its sales from online well before the pandemic. More than 300 Argos counters are now inside Sainsbury's supermarkets, making it easy for people to pick up goods and gifts. Its fast-track delivery service can deliver to customers' homes and collection points within hours and this has seen growth of 62%. This is a business that's been well placed to benefit from the huge shift to digital this Christmas. Christmas and New Year celebrations were constrained by coronavirus restrictions, which limited the number of people and households allowed to meet up. Sainsbury's said that while people had smaller gatherings, they still treated themselves, with sales of the supermarket's premium Taste the Difference range up 11%. Premium champagne sales were up 52%, it added,echoing similar findings by rival Morrisons. ""People did more home baking than usual, with mincemeat sales up 24%. Customers still wanted New Year's Eve at home to feel special and we sold a record number of steaks,"" Sainsbury's said. Sales of groceries, general merchandise and clothing were stronger than expected throughout the quarter, particularly since the start of England's second national lockdown, it added. Clothing benefited from better-than-anticipated full-price sales, driven by customers shopping earlier for Christmas and changes to the supermarket's Black Friday trading strategy. Separate figures issued by discount retailer B&M indicated that it too had a good Christmas, with like-for-like revenues at its UK stores up 21.1% year-on-year in the 13 weeks to 26 December. ""With our combination of exceptional value and convenient out-of-town locations, we are confident that our business model will prove highly relevant to the needs of customers in 2021,"" said chief executive Simon Arora.

"The controversy over drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge has been ongoing since 1977 The Trump administration has held the first sale for rights to drill for oil in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge - but it drew no interest from major companies. An Alaskan state agency emerged as the primary bidder at the auction, which has been heavily criticised by environmental groups. The sale raised less than $15m (Â£11m) - far less than the government had hoped. The tepid interest comes amid big changes in the energy industry. Major companies, including oil giant Exxon, Shell and BP, have said they are focusing their spending on renewable energy, amid a huge slump in oil prices, in part triggered by the coronavirus pandemic. The wildlife at risk from drilling plan in Arctic refuge Why 2021 could be turning point for tackling climate change Adam Kolton, executive director of the Alaska Wilderness League, said the sale was an ""epic failure"" for the Trump administration and the Alaska Republicans, who had backed the move as a way to create jobs and reduce American dependence on foreign oil. ""After years of promising a revenue and jobs bonanza they ended up throwing a party for themselves, with the state being one of the only bidders,""he said in a statement,external. ""We have long known that the American people don't want drilling in the Arctic Refuge, the [Alaska native] Gwich'in people don't want it, and now we know the oil industry doesn't want it either."" The refuge is home to more than 200 species of bird including the Northern shrike Mr Kolton said his organisation would continue to fight in court to reverse the sale of the land, which is home to caribou, polar bears and millions of migratory birds. The wildlife refuge is estimated to hold some 11 billion barrels of oil. Opening the wilderness for drilling and development has been a long-term priority for Alaska Republicans, but development was expected to be costly since the area has minimal roads and infrastructure. After decades of controversy, the sale was finally authorised by the US Congress in 2017 as part of a major package of tax cuts. The auction comes just weeks before Donald Trump is due to leave office on 20 January. President-elect Joe Biden had vowed to protect the refuge and environmental groups have also challenged the sale, which they say threatens land that provides a vital home to wildlife. A federal court rejected arguments by environmental groups seeking to block the auction on Tuesday. Polar bears are particularly at risk of dying in oil spills At Wednesday's auction, the Bureau of Land Management said it had received bids for 12 of the 22 tracts of land offered, covering more than 600,000 acres. The Alaska Industrial Development and Industrial Authority, a state agency, was the sole bidder on at least eight of the 12 tracts. Some bids submitted were ""incomplete"", the bureau said. The state agency has said it plans to work with private companies on development of the refuge, which encompasses more than 19,000 million acres overall. On social media platform Twitter, Alaska Governor Mike Dunleavy called the sale ""historic for Alaska and tremendous for America"". ""Opening [Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge] for responsible resource development could put more oil in our pipeline, put Alaskans to work, bring billions of dollars of investment to our state, support American energy independence, and provide critical revenues to our state and local communities,"" he wrote. ""Alaskans have waited two generations for this moment; I stand with them in support of this day.""

"This video can not be played When a mob stormed the US capitol The US Congress has certified Joe Biden's victory in the presidential election, hours after supporters of Donald Trump stormed the building in an attack that saw four people die. Lawmakers resumed the session after police removed a mob that had been encouraged by President Trump as part of his attempt to overturn his defeat. The certification clears the way for Mr Biden to be sworn in on 20 January. In response, Mr Trump finally pledged an ""orderly transition"" of power. Follow our live updates here Wednesday's chaotic scenes followed months of escalating rhetoric from Mr Trump and some Republican allies that sought to undermine the result of the 3 November election. The invasion of the Capitol by the president's supporters - some armed - was an event without precedent in modern American history. Washington DC Mayor Muriel Bowser said one of the four who died - a woman named as Ashli Babbitt - was part of a group that forced entry into the chamber of the House of Representatives while it was still in session. They were confronted by plainclothes officers, and an officer pulled out a weapon and fired it. What does a deadly day mean for Trump's legacy? In pictures: Pro-Trump protesters storm Capitol 'They tried to break in - then I heard a shot' The US Capitol Police said the employee involved had been put on administrative leave pending an investigation. This video can not be played The US Congress has formally confirmed Joe Biden's victory Local media said Ashli Babbitt was a San Diego-area US Air Force veteran and Trump supporter. She was proclaimed dead at hospital. One woman and two men died as a result of ""medical emergencies"", officials said, without giving details. At least 14 members of the police were injured. The FBI is now seeking to identify those involved,externalin the rampage, which came after Mr Trump had told a rally he would never concede the election and urged his supporters to march on the Capitol. It also came on the daytwo Democrats won Senate seats in elections in Georgia,giving the party effective control of the whole of Congress. This major political victory will ease the passage of Mr Biden's agenda after he is inaugurated. Democrat Joe Biden's victory was confirmed at about 03:30 local time (08:30 GMT) on Thursday in a joint session presided over by Republican Vice-President Mike Pence, who called the violence a ""dark day in the history of the United States Capitol"". Mr Biden blasted the ""insurrection"" as Mr Trump, while telling the mob to ""go home"", continued to make false claims of electoral fraud. The outgoing president's Twitter and Facebook accounts were later frozenand remain blocked. Objections by some Republican lawmakers to overturn the result in Arizona and Pennsylvania were rejected. Congress formally certified the final electoral college vote, with Mr Biden receiving 306 votes to Mr Trump's 232. For days Mr Trump had been piling pressure on his vice-president to block certification. But in a letter to Congress on Wednesday, Mr Pence said he had no ""unilateral authority to decide which electoral votes should be counted"". This video can not be played 'I just want the real winner to be president' In declaring the final vote totals, Mr Pence said this ""shall be deemed a sufficient declaration of the persons elected president and vice-president of the United States"". Shortly afterwards Mr Trump said in a statement: ""Even though I totally disagree with the outcome of the election, and the facts bear me out, nevertheless there will be an orderly transition on January 20th."" On Thursday the White House press office issued a statement saying it ""grieves the loss of life"" and will continue ""to pray for a speedy recovery for those who suffered injury"". This is how the Trump presidency ends. Not with a whimper, but with a bang. For weeks, Donald Trump had been pointing to 6 January as a day of reckoning. It was when he told his supporters to come to Washington DC, and challenge Congress - and Vice-President Mike Pence - to discard the results of November's election and keep the presidency in his hands. Crisis can bring political opportunity, and there are many politicians who will not hesitate to use it to gain advantage. Donald Trump - for now - is still in power. And while he may be chastened, he may be sitting in the White House residence watching television temporarily without his social media outlet, he will not be silent for long. And once he decamps for his new Florida home, he could begin making plans to settle scores and, perhaps, someday return to power and rebuild a legacy that, for the moment, lies in tatters.Biden win certified by Congress after chaotic day Read more from Anthony In addition to Mr Pence, some Republicans who previously stood by the president have now spoken out. Has the Capitol been attacked before? The people who still believe Trump won What is the electoral college? Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell definitively broke with Mr Trump in an emotional speech from the chamber floor on Wednesday, saying: ""If this election were overturned by mere allegations from the losing side, our democracy would enter a death spiral."" After the session resumed, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer blasted the mob at the Capitol as ""rioters and insurrectionists, goons and thugs, domestic terrorists"", saying the president ""bears a great deal of the blame"". This video can not be played ""We will never give up, we will never concede"", Trump tells supporters Senator Kelly Loeffler, who lost her bid for election in Georgia's vote on Tuesday, said she could no longer in good conscience vote against certification as she had originally planned, citing the ""abhorrent"" invasion of the Capitol. With two weeks before Mr Trump leaves office, there are calls for him to be removed beforehand for instigating the attack on Congress. US media say somemembers of his cabinet have discussed invoking the 25th amendment to the Constitution, which deals with removing a president deemed unfit for office. Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee have said that Mr Trump's actions meet the amendment's requirements. On Wednesday afternoon protesters surged up the Capitol steps shoving past barricades and officers in riot gear to penetrate the building. The mob - some of whom wore body armour - used chemical irritants to attack police, according to Washington police. They shouted and waved pro-Trump, US and Confederate flags as they roamed the halls, demanding the results of the presidential election be overturned. Members of Congress scrambled for cover under their seats as tear gas was fired. Several thousand National Guard troops, FBI agents and US Secret Service personnel were deployed to help overwhelmed Capitol police. The apparent ease with which Trump supporters were able to act has raised serious questions about security. Two pipe bombs were recovered, one from the Democratic National Committee offices, not far from the Capitol, and one from the nearby Republican National Committee headquarters. The occupation of the Capitol lasted more than three hours before the building was secured by law enforcement. At least 52 people have been arrested, the vast majority of them for violating the 18:00 to 06:00 curfew. Washington is under an extended state of emergency until after Mr Biden's inauguration. After sitting at the desk of US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, one protester left a message reading ""we will not back down"" Responding to the violence, Mr Biden said the mob's activity ""border[ed] on sedition"" and that democracy was ""under unprecedented assault"". ""To storm the Capitol, to smash windows, to occupy offices on the floor of the United States Senate, rummaging through desks, on the House of Representatives, threatening the safety of duly elected officials. It's not protest; it's insurrection."" This video can not be played Joe Biden: The scenes of chaos at the Capitol do not reflect a true America, do not represent who we are Mr Trump posted a recorded video on Twitter saying: ""I know your pain. I know you're hurt... We had an election that was stolen from us. It was a landslide election, and everyone knows it, especially the other side. But you have to go home now. We have to have peace."" For the first time, Twitter froze Mr Trump's account, saying it would be locked for 12 hours. The social media giant demanded he delete three tweets that it said could stoke violence and threatening ""permanent suspension"". Facebook and Instagram followed suit. Hours earlier, Mr Trump had addressed a ""Save America Rally"" outside the White House, where he encouraged supporters to keep contesting the election result: ""Our country has had enough and we will not take it anymore."" Political figures from around the worldcondemned the violence.In the US, former President Barack Obama said history would rightly remember the assault on the Capitol as ""as a moment of great dishonour and shame for our nation"". Former President George W Bush said: ""It is a sickening & heartbreaking sight. This is how election results are disputed in a banana republic - not our democratic republic.""

"The controversy over drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge has been ongoing since 1977 The Trump administration has held the first sale for rights to drill for oil in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge - but it drew no interest from major companies. An Alaskan state agency emerged as the primary bidder at the auction, which has been heavily criticised by environmental groups. The sale raised less than $15m (Â£11m) - far less than the government had hoped. The tepid interest comes amid big changes in the energy industry. Major companies, including oil giant Exxon, Shell and BP, have said they are focusing their spending on renewable energy, amid a huge slump in oil prices, in part triggered by the coronavirus pandemic. The wildlife at risk from drilling plan in Arctic refuge Why 2021 could be turning point for tackling climate change Adam Kolton, executive director of the Alaska Wilderness League, said the sale was an ""epic failure"" for the Trump administration and the Alaska Republicans, who had backed the move as a way to create jobs and reduce American dependence on foreign oil. ""After years of promising a revenue and jobs bonanza they ended up throwing a party for themselves, with the state being one of the only bidders,""he said in a statement,external. ""We have long known that the American people don't want drilling in the Arctic Refuge, the [Alaska native] Gwich'in people don't want it, and now we know the oil industry doesn't want it either."" The refuge is home to more than 200 species of bird including the Northern shrike Mr Kolton said his organisation would continue to fight in court to reverse the sale of the land, which is home to caribou, polar bears and millions of migratory birds. The wildlife refuge is estimated to hold some 11 billion barrels of oil. Opening the wilderness for drilling and development has been a long-term priority for Alaska Republicans, but development was expected to be costly since the area has minimal roads and infrastructure. After decades of controversy, the sale was finally authorised by the US Congress in 2017 as part of a major package of tax cuts. The auction comes just weeks before Donald Trump is due to leave office on 20 January. President-elect Joe Biden had vowed to protect the refuge and environmental groups have also challenged the sale, which they say threatens land that provides a vital home to wildlife. A federal court rejected arguments by environmental groups seeking to block the auction on Tuesday. Polar bears are particularly at risk of dying in oil spills At Wednesday's auction, the Bureau of Land Management said it had received bids for 12 of the 22 tracts of land offered, covering more than 600,000 acres. The Alaska Industrial Development and Industrial Authority, a state agency, was the sole bidder on at least eight of the 12 tracts. Some bids submitted were ""incomplete"", the bureau said. The state agency has said it plans to work with private companies on development of the refuge, which encompasses more than 19,000 million acres overall. On social media platform Twitter, Alaska Governor Mike Dunleavy called the sale ""historic for Alaska and tremendous for America"". ""Opening [Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge] for responsible resource development could put more oil in our pipeline, put Alaskans to work, bring billions of dollars of investment to our state, support American energy independence, and provide critical revenues to our state and local communities,"" he wrote. ""Alaskans have waited two generations for this moment; I stand with them in support of this day.""

"British Gas engineers have begun a five-day strike from Thursday in a dispute over new contracts. Thousands of staff have walked out in response to an attempt by the firm to push through pay cuts by threatening to fire workers, union GMB said. It accused Centrica owner British Gas of provoking the strike. Centrica said it had done everything it could to avoid a strike, adding it would prioritise vulnerable households and emergencies during the walkout. Justin Bowden, GMB national secretary, said: ""GMB members from Land's End to John O'Groats have stayed home, stayed safe and supported the first national gas strike in a decade. ""The months and months of fire and rehire pay cut threats from British Gas CEO Chris O'Shea have provoked thousands and thousands of GMB engineers and call centre staff to strike, the only option left to them by a business that made Â£901m operating profit yet still plans to sack them because they won't accept the scale of cuts it demands,"" he added. Some British Gas workers have taken to social media to voice their support for the strike. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

A Centrica spokeswoman said: ""We've done everything we can with the GMB to avoid industrial action. ""While we've made great progress with our other unions, sadly the GMB leadership seems intent on causing disruption to customers during the coldest weekend of the year, amid a global health crisis and in the middle of a national lockdown,"" she said. ""We have strong contingency plans in place to ensure we will still be there for customers who really need us."" Almost 90% of GMB members voted for industrial action in a ballot of 9,000 members last month in response to an attempt by Centrica to cut some salaries by up to 10%, the union said. In total, more than 7,500 staff could walk out, although Centrica said GMB had committed to ensure emergency callouts were not affected, adding that it also had contractors that it could call upon. In June, Centrica said it planned to to cut around 5,000 jobsto ""arrest the decline"" of the company. It has been losing customers to rivals and, in February last year, blamed a big loss in 2019 on the energy price cap and falling gas prices. Centrica has since said the coronavirus crisis has shown how the company could be ""agile and responsive"". Commenting on the strike, Centrica said 83% of workers had already accepted its new terms and conditions, which it said protected base pay and pensions. ""This shows most of our people understand that our business needs to change because customer needs are changing,"" the spokeswoman said. ""GMB's mandate for strike action is weak; they are fighting against modernisation and changes which will help to protect well-paid jobs in the long-term and are doing so at a time that our country needs everyone to pull together.""

"George had mottled skin, swelling on his lips, a high temperature and could not keep fluids down The mother of a baby who was treated in hospital for Covid-19 has urged parents to be alert to symptoms such as mottled skin and sickness. Myer Rudelhoff's four-month-old son George spent three nights in Basildon hospital, in Essex. He had patchy skin, swelling on his lips, a high temperature and could not keep fluids down. She said: ""I thought it was a sickness bug. I had no idea it was caused by coronavirus."" George spent three nights in Basildon hospital Diarrhoea, vomiting and abdominal cramps in childrencan be a sign of coronavirusaccording to some researchers, but theofficially recognised symptoms,externalare a fever, cough and loss of smell or taste. Mrs Rudlehoff, who lives in Basildon, noticed her son had a temperature on New Year's Eve but put it down to teething. George began vomiting the following evening and on 2 January she called NHS 111, who told her to take him to hospital. She said: ""I really did not want to go. I was so scared about him getting the virus there, I had no idea he had it. ""He got so poorly so quickly when we arrived and was really lethargic. They took a swab and, when they said he was positive, I burst into tears. It was such a shock."" Myer Rudelhoff was scared to take her son to hospital but realised he was too poorly and needed treatment The mother-of-two said she presumed it was not Covid-19 because he did not have a cough, though he did develop a mild one a few days later while in hospital. She said the staff were ""amazing"" and she wanted to reassure parents ""not to be afraid to go to hospital"" if their children were ill. George made a good recovery in hospital Nurses told her they had treated several other children with the same mottled skin and sickness and asked her to share her story to raise awareness of these symptoms. Mrs Rudelhoff's post on Facebook was shared nearly 7,000 times within three days. In the post, she said she felt ""upset, angry and frustrated"" because she had taken the illness very seriously but George had still managed to catch it. He was the only member of the family who tested positive. George was discharged from hospital and was making a good recovery at home, she said. George is now making a good recovery at home and is being looked after by his big brother Stanley Dr Kilali Ominu-Evbota, paediatric consultant at Mid and South Essex NHS Foundation Trust, said: ""It's great to hear that George is now back home and on the road to recovery. ""George's family did the right thing and we encourage parents to seek medical advice with their GP or via the NHS 111 service in order to get the correct treatment for their child.""

"Emma Barnett took the reins of Woman's Hour earlier this week Woman's Hour host Emma Barnett has defended herself after a guest who was booked to appear on the BBC Radio 4 programme dropped out due to remarks the presenter made about her off-air. Kelechi Okafor said,externalshe was treated in a ""degrading"" and ""vile"" manner. Barnett said she and her producers were discussing alleged anti-Semitic remarks Okafor had made in the past. The host said she then raised these directly, adding: ""I stand by my questions to my team and to Kelechi."" Barnett said Okafor ""denied the allegations and hung up"". Okafor, who is an actress, dance instructor and podcaster, had been booked for an item about the #MeToo movement. Wednesday's programme marked a year since the trial of disgraced film producer Harvey Weinstein, who was jailed for 23 years for rape and sexual assault. The 15-minute discussion was intended to explore what the #MeToo movement has achieved. After Okafor pulled out of the programme, the item went ahead with the other guests, Rosanna Arquette and Caitlin Dulany - two of the actresses who accused Weinstein of sexual assault. Writing on Twitter, she said Barnett spoke about her in a disrespectful way, without realising she could be heard. ""The host didn't realise her mic was on as she was talking about me before the interview started,""Okafor posted.,external ""You can have a genuine concern about something you've been told about me and address it in a manner that is kind. That wasn't what took place. ""The need for me on today's show was to offer balance to these wayward women thinking that the MeToo movement is no longer needed. The fact is that if you feel it's no longer needed for your white middle class sensibilities, marginalised voices still need it. ""We haven't heard from everybody regarding the violations they've faced. The originators of the MeToo movement were black women. From enslaved black women who were raped by slave owners to Tarana Burke yet their voices are yet to be honoured."" Writing on Twitter, Barnett said:,external""Just before I went on air this morning to present a special programme about Me Too... it came to my attention that one of our guests, Kelechi Okafor, had made alleged anti-Semitic remarks. ""I was also sent a press report of the transcript of what she had said on her podcast supporting Reggie Yates's comments about Jewish male managers and profits."" Yates apologised in 2017after saying in a podcast interview: ""The thing that makes it great about this new generation of [music] artists is that they ain't signing to majors. They're independent, they're not managed by some random fat Jewish guy from north west London, they're managed by their brethren."" Later that year,Okafor said,externalYates had been speaking ""the truth"" and said his comments were ""not problematic"". Barnett continued: ""As Weinstein is also Jewish and was referenced as part of this same podcast, I was discussing with my producers the role of this guest in light of her allegedly anti-Semitic comments. Kelechi overheard that chat on our open Zoom link - with two minutes to airtime. ""I then directly talked to Kelechi about the allegations, standing by my queries, and said she could put her response across in the programme. She denied the allegations and hung up, choosing to no longer be part of the programme. ""I stand by my questions to my team and to Kelechi. I would have happily hosted her on the programme with a question on this issue."" Me Too founder says movement not over The Queen sends birthday wishes to Woman's Hour She added: ""I believe people can always answer for themselves - but equally it is my duty to ask people what qualifies them as a leading voice in a space."" A BBC spokesman said: ""During an off-air conversation ahead of the programme, Emma Barnett and the production team talked about a guest's role in the discussion, and how to reflect some of the guest's alleged previous comments and the issue of anti-Semitism as part of the Woman's Hour discussion on the role of minority voices in the MeToo movement. ""This was also raised directly with the guest before going on air."" The BBC said the off-air conversation did not make reference to Okafor's race. The alleged incident occurred on Barnett's third day as the new presenter of Woman's Hour. Dame Jenni Murray and Jane Garvey both left the programme last year.

"This video can not be played Trump has tweeted a video finally condemning the Capitol rioters US President Donald Trump has been allowed to Tweet again, after being locked out of his account for 12 hours. Posting a more conciliatory message, he refrained from reiterating false claims of voter fraud. Twitter said that it would ban Mr Trump ""permanently"" if he breached the platform's rules again. The move from Twitter puts clear water between it and Facebook, which suspended him ""indefinitely"" on Thursday. Twitter has instead given the outgoing president a final warning. Earlier on Thursday, the popular gaming platform Twitch also placed an indefinite ban on Mr Trump's channel, which he has used for rally broadcasts. Mr Trump tweeted several message on Wednesday, calling the people who stormed Capitol Hill ""patriots"". He also said ""We love you."" This video can not be played When a mob stormed the US capitol A spokesperson for Twitter said: ""After the Tweets were removed and the subsequent 12-hour period expired, access to @realDonaldTrump was restored. ""Any future violations of the Twitter Rules, including our Civic Integrity or Violent Threats policies, will result in permanent suspension of the @realDonaldTrump account."" Earlier in the day, the president was suspended from Facebook and Instagram. That suspension will be reviewed after the transition of power to Joe Biden on 20 January. The social network had originally imposed a 24-hour ban after the US Capitol attack. Facebook's chief, Mark Zuckerberg, wrote that the risks of allowing Mr Trump to post ""are simply too great"". Mr Zuckerberg said Facebook had removed the president's posts ""because we judged that their effect - and likely their intent - would be to provoke further violence"". Allow Facebook content?

He said it was clear Mr Trump intended to undermine the transfer of power to President-elect Joe Biden. ""Therefore, we are extending the block we have placed on his Facebook and Instagram accounts indefinitely and for at least the next two weeks until the peaceful transition of power is complete,"" he wrote. Mr Trump's favoured platform, Twitter, suspended the president for 12 hours on Wednesday. The company said it required the removal of three tweets for ""severe violations of our Civic Integrity policy"". It said the president's account would remain locked for good if the tweets were not removed. Twitter has now confirmed the offending tweets have been removed, and he is free to tweet again. LIVE: Biden victory confirmed after deadly attack on Capitol Trumpâs Twitter endgame What does a deadly day mean for Trump's legacy? Snapchat also stopped Mr Trump from creating new posts, but did not say if or when it would end the ban. YouTube also removed Wednesday's video. The president's supporters stormed the seat of US governmentand clashed with police, leading to the death of one woman. The violence brought to a halt congressional debate over Democrat Joe Biden's election win. In the House and Senate chambers, Republicans were challenging the certification of November's election results.

"Lester Shum was first barred from running for office, then arrested More than 50 of Hong Kong's most prominent pro-democracy activists and politicians have been arrested in the biggest crackdown since China imposed a draconian security law last year. About 1,000 police took part in morning raids on 72 premises across the city. Those held helped run an unofficial ""primary"" to pick opposition candidates ahead of postponed 2020 elections. They are accused of trying to ""overthrow"" the government. Activists say the new law aims to quash dissent. China's government imposed the legislation on the semi-autonomous territory in June, saying it was necessary to curb months of sometimes violent pro-democracy protests. Beijing defended Wednesday's arrests, with Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying saying they were needed to stop ""external forces and individuals [colluding] to undermine China's stability and security"". But the crackdown appeared to confirm the fears of many who warned about the reach of the law, with Amnesty International saying the arrests are ""the starkest demonstration yet of how the national security law has been weaponised to punish anyone who dares to challenge the establishment"". Dozens have been arrested under the security law since it was enacted in June, but never have so many been rounded up at the same time as on Wednesday, which marked a major escalation in the crackdown and sent a chill through pro-democracy figures. Police fanned out around the city and in early morning raids detained 53 people who represent a who's who of democratic forces in the former British colony, young and old. They include: long-established opposition figures James To, Lam Cheuk-ting, Claudio Mo and Benny Tai, one of the initiators of the primaries young pro-democracy campaigners Lester Shum, Gwyneth Ho, Tiffany Yuen and Jeffrey Andrews Human rights lawyer John Clancey, a US citizen two academics behind the primaries strategy 13 candidates from the primaries Police also searched the home of already detained activist Joshua Wong, as well as three news outlets. Apple Daily and Stand News, which had co-organised election forums for the primaries candidates, and In-Media, which ran ads around the primaries, were ordered to hand over information. Mr Clancy, a veteran legal activist and long-time resident of Hong Kong, is chairman of the Asian Human Rights Commission and the first US citizen held under the new law. He was detained when police searched the offices of law firm Ho Tse Wai & Partners where he works. Benny Tai was one of the architects of the primaries Hours after the dawn arrests John Lee, Hong Kong's security secretary, confirmed a group of people had been arrested as part of an operation targeting those suspected of ""overthrowing"" the city's government. The government will not tolerate ""subversive"" acts, he said, speaking at the city's Legislative Council. If charged under the new national security law, the detainees could face life in prison. The BBC's Danny Vincent in Hong Kong says the legislation has spread what activists call ""white terror"" across the city. It has all but silenced the street protest movement and led to a growing number of activists fleeing the territory. When authorities introduced the law, they claimed it would target only a small number of activists, but the wide-ranging nature of Wednesday's operation has led many to fear the authorities are now trying to eliminate the entire opposition camp, he says. In July last year, an alliance of opposition parties ran independently organised primaries to see which of their candidates had the best chances in September's election for the Legislative Council (LegCo), Hong Kong's parliament. More than 600,000 people voted in the primaries. The election was later postponed, with officials citing concerns over the coronavirus pandemic as the reason for the delay. China's new law: Why is Hong Kong worried? The background you need on Hong Kong's protests The opposition groups had hoped that winning more seats would give them enough power to block government proposals and increase pressure for democratic reforms. Hong Kong's leaderCarrie Lam had warned at the time the primaries could amount to subversion,externalif the candidates intended to obstruct government policies through their election. In July, Joshua Wong (on right in poster) and Lester Shum (on left) had still hoped to run for LegCo Several of the opposition figures planning to stand in the LegCo electionwere later disqualified from running, including Joshua Wong, Lester Shum and Gwyneth Ho, a former journalist who rose to prominence covering the 2019 protests. Hong Kong pro-democracy lawmakers resign en masse Can Hong Kong's democracy fight survive the walkout? Most of the opposition lawmakers in the current LegCo resigned in November in protest at four of them being dismissed from parliament. The crackdown has stunned people in Hong Kong. ""Seeing the news today I feel completely shocked. I feel very disappointed. It seems that such major things are happening in Hong Kong and there's nothing we can do about it. ""I feel very unhappy and it seems that even during the epidemic the government can still do so many things to terrorise people,"" Mannie Ng, a Hong Kong resident, told Reuters news agency.

"Lester Shum was first barred from running for office, then arrested More than 50 of Hong Kong's most prominent pro-democracy activists and politicians have been arrested in the biggest crackdown since China imposed a draconian security law last year. About 1,000 police took part in morning raids on 72 premises across the city. Those held helped run an unofficial ""primary"" to pick opposition candidates ahead of postponed 2020 elections. They are accused of trying to ""overthrow"" the government. Activists say the new law aims to quash dissent. China's government imposed the legislation on the semi-autonomous territory in June, saying it was necessary to curb months of sometimes violent pro-democracy protests. Beijing defended Wednesday's arrests, with Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying saying they were needed to stop ""external forces and individuals [colluding] to undermine China's stability and security"". But the crackdown appeared to confirm the fears of many who warned about the reach of the law, with Amnesty International saying the arrests are ""the starkest demonstration yet of how the national security law has been weaponised to punish anyone who dares to challenge the establishment"".
