"This video can not be played Covid: Vaccine supplies could see roll-out 'slowdown' Scotland's vaccination programme is likely to slow down later this month because of supply problems, the first minister has warned. Nicola Sturgeon said a ""temporary reduction"" in Pfizer's manufacturing capacity meant the country had received slightly lower stocks of the vaccine than expected. This means the number of vaccination appointments is likely to be reduced. But Ms Sturgeon said Scotland is still on track to hit its vaccine targets. And she said the country would be able to ""rapidly accelerate"" the vaccination programme again if supplies increase again. A further 63,178 people had their first dose of the vaccine on Wednesday - the highest in a single day so fardespite the bad weather- bringing the total in Scotland to 1,048,747. The figure for the UK as a whole stands at more than 13 million. How many people have been vaccinated in Scotland? Nearly a quarter (23%) of all adults in Scotland have had their first dose, including about 97% of over 80-year-olds, 87% of those aged between 75 and 79 and 54% of 70 to 74-year-olds. Ms Sturgeon said the figures meant that Scotland had given the first dose to 75,000 more people than than had originally been expected by this stage. And she said it gave ""real hope"" that the vaccine will soon start to have an impact on the number of people dying or becoming seriously ill with the virus. A record number of people were vaccinated on Wednesday despite many parts of the country seeing extreme weather conditions But she said the higher than expected take-up, alongside reduced supplies of the Pfizer jab and the need to preserve some stocks for second doses, meant that ""we may need to reduce the number of appointments that we schedule over the next few weeks"". The first minister added: ""This sort of issue is not unexpected, given the huge complexities that the vaccination programme throws up. ""Importantly, we remain on course to meet the key targets we have set out. ""And we still anticipate, subject to supply, that everyone over the age of 50 will have received their first dose by early May."" It was revealed last month that the UK was set to face short-term delays in delivery of the Pfizer jab as the pharmaceutical company upgraded its production capacity. Pfizer is upscaling production at its plant in Puurs, Belgium, in efforts to produce more doses than originally planned for 2021 - temporarily reducing deliveries to all European countries. The American firm said at the time that this would mean ""fewer doses will be available for European countries at the end of January and the beginning of February.""

She added: ""That will reduce our expected supply next week and the week after by about somewhere between 120,000 and 190,000 doses a week overall over the two vaccines."" But the UK government said it was ""confident of our vaccine supply"" and that it would be able to hit its target of vaccinating everyone in the top four priority groups by next Monday. The prime minister's official spokesman said: ""We are confident of supplies but we haven't commented on details of delivery schedules or movements of the vaccines."" And a spokeswoman from Northern Ireland's Department of Health said: ""We are not aware of any Pfizer supply issues and are continuing to work through the priority groups as planned."" Meanwhile, the deaths of a further 48 people in Scotland who had previously tested positive for the virus have been recorded in the past 24 hours, bringing the total by that measure to 6,599. However, only 4% of the tests carried out on Wednesday returned positive results - down from 4.8% the previous day. The R number - effectively the rate at which the virus is transmitted - continues to be below one. And the number of people in hospital wards with the virus has now fallen slightly below the peak from the first wave last year, with the number of patients in ICU units also gradually falling.

"University of Hull student Libby Squire was last seen in the early hours of 1 February 2019 A serial sex offender has been found guilty of raping and murdering a student before dumping her body in a river. Pawel Relowicz, 26, prowled the streets of Hull before attacking ""vulnerable"" 21-year-old Libby Squire. Jurors heard Relowicz had committed a string of offences against women prior to the killing. Speaking outside Sheffield Crown Court, Libby's mother paid tribute to her ""beautiful, caring, wonderful girl"". During the trial, prosecutor Richard Wright QC said Relowicz had spent the night of 31 January 2019 driving around looking for a woman to attack. The killer at the window Jurors heard University of Hull philosophy student Ms Squire, who had been turned away from a nightclub, was drunk and ""extremely vulnerable"" when Relowicz ""intercepted"" her . He drove her to Oak Road playing fields, where he attacked her before putting her in the River Hull. Prosecutors said the married father-of-two had repeatedly lied to police, his wife and in court documents about what happened on the night of Ms Squire's disappearance. Pawel Relowicz had previously committed a string of sexual offences against women He maintained he had consensual sex with the student and said he had lied because he did not want his wife to find out he had cheated on her. After a massive search effort, Ms Squire's remains were found in the Humber Estuary almost two months later. Her parents, Lisa and Russ, held hands and cried as they sat in the public gallery overlooking the courtroom to await the verdicts. Speaking outside court, Mrs Squire thanked supporters but said Relowicz's conviction ""changes nothing for us, there is no closure"". ""We don't get to have Libby back and our lives don't revert back to normal,"" she said. ""Libby will always be with us and we are all so proud of our beautiful, caring, wonderful girl. ""And, although she has been physically taken from us, the memories we have and the love we share will never be."" This video can not be played Lisa Squire paid tribute to her ""beautiful, caring, wonderful"" daughter Polish national Relowicz, a butcher, showed no emotion as the jury foreman read out the verdicts. He will be sentenced on Friday. Jurors found him guilty of rape unanimously and guilty of murder by a majority verdict of 11 to one. Pathologists were unable to establish how she died, or whether she was still alive when she went into the water. Witnessesreported hearing screamsfrom the playing fields on the night she disappeared. Gerry Wareham, from the Crown Prosecution Service said CCTV footage of Relowicz and Ms Squire's last known movements was ""crucial evidence"" in bringing the case to court. This video can not be played Footage of Libby Squire and Pawel Relowicz's movements was shown to jurors During the 14-day trial, the jury of seven women and five men heard Relowicz hadprevious convictions for voyeurism, performing sex acts in public and stealing sex toys and underwear from women's homes. One ofhis previous voyeurism victims told the BBCshe hoped the police would learn from the case. She said his earlier offences were ""sufficiently minor"" by themselves ""to not actually require the level of investigation that would result in him being caught"". In a statement, Humberside Police said it was ""satisfied"" with its investigation and that officers ""acted quickly"" to identify, locate and apprehend the defendant within days of Ms Squire's disappearance. Det Supt Martin Smalley said: ""I can understand that people are interested to know whether Libby's tragic death could have been prevented. ""It is important to remember that whilst, taken as a whole, and with the benefit of hindsight, we may be able to point to a history of offending by Pawel Relowicz, officers investigating these offences at the time were doing so with far less information than we have now and that my investigation into Libby's disappearance had."" Det Supt Smalley said the investigation was ""one of the most challenging and emotional cases"" in his 30-year career The University of Hull said it would continue to offer support to the student community. Vice-Chancellor Prof Susan Lea said in a statement: ""What took place in February 2019 deeply affected everyone at the university and those within the local community. ""Libby made a huge impact during her time at Hull, and will be remembered fondly by all who met her."" She said the ""kindness and care shown by everyone was overwhelming"" both at the university and in the wider community.

"Tommy Ross took this picture from Kit Hill near Launceston in Cornwall A huge fire has broken out across an area of moorland in Dartmoor, Devon. Rob Steemson, Dartmoor National Park emergency officer, estimated the blaze to be about 5km (3.1 miles) wide and continuing to spread. He said the fire, which could be seen about 20 miles away in Plymouth, was being stoked by fierce south-westerly winds. The blaze is on remote moorland near Tavistock and no residents or animals are thought to have been injured. Mr Steemson said a ""watching brief"" was ongoing overnight ""because although it is affecting the moorland, it's not affecting any property or walkers or people out there"". He said he believed firefighters were not directly trying to put out the blaze because of the strength of the winds. ""All being well it will peter out when it goes out of the wind and into the river valleys,"" the emergency officer said. The fire can be seen from the hamlet of Hatt in Cornwall Ten fire service vehicles are dealing with the fire at Tavy Cleave, a Devon and Somerset Fire spokesman said, adding that members of the public should avoid the area. The area on fire was ""general moorland"", Mr Steemson said, made up of heather, gorse and bracken. He said many Dartmoor residents were trained in dealing with fires of this nature, but had not yet been asked to go out. The fire is thought to be about 5km (3.1 miles) wide Colin Sargent saw the blaze from his house at Brentor on the western edge of Dartmoor. ""It was a long line of flames and the sky was just getting redder and redder,"" he said. ""It was just a red glow in the sky like a sunset or sunrise."" Colin Sargent said the blaze looked like a sunset This fire is the latest in a spate of winter blazes, includingat a nature reserve in Cornwallanda number of them in Scotland's Western Isles, all on Wednesday. Area commander Bruce Farquharson, from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, said winter fires were not uncommon due to extreme cold ""curing"" or drying out vegetation, and happened in Antarctica, Norway and. Scandinavia. He told BBC Radio 4's PM programme: ""It is counter intuitive for almost everybody but the risk is there, the vegetation is tinder dry and it just takes the slightest spark to ignite the fire and it will burn very quickly and spread very quickly."" BBC weatherman David Braine said the air temperature at Okehampton on the northern edge of Dartmoor was 0C at 22:30, with wind chill making it feel like -8C.

"The European Commission's Maros Sefcovic arrives in London to meet the UK's Michael Gove The UK and the EU have had a ""frank but constructive discussion"" on problems implementing post-Brexit trade rules in Northern Ireland. Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove met the vice-president of the European Commission, Maros Sefcovic, in London on Thursday evening. Both sides reiterated their ""full commitment"" to the so-called Northern Ireland Protocol. But they pledged to meet again to ""address all outstanding issues"". Mr Gove had previously called for an urgent ""reset"" on the arrangements, which see checks taking place between Northern Ireland and Great Britain - calling for a two-year ""grace period"" on the rules. But the Irish Taoiseach, MicheÃ¡l Martin, said any pause in enforcement could only be a matter of months,telling the BBC: ""It can't be a year."" Writing to Mr Gove ahead of the meeting, Mr Sefcovic said the existing protocol was ""the only way"" to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. However, Northern Ireland's First Minister, Arlene Foster - who wants the protocol scrapped - said ""more rigorous implementation"" was ""not going to work"". What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? Urgent reset needed on NI trade rules - Gove Martin calls on 'big beasts' of EU to 'cool it' The Northern Ireland Protocol was designed to ensure an open border remained on the island of Ireland after Brexit. But to make it work, the two sides agreed that Northern Ireland would remain in the single market for goods, unlike the rest of the UK. This meant checks had to be introduced on some goods travelling between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Since the new rules came into force, there has been tensions at ports in Northern Ireland, with disruption to some food supplies and online deliveries. Checks at some ports weretemporarily suspended at the beginning of Februaryover ""sinister"" threats made to some border staff who were carrying out checks on goods. Unionists want the protocol to be scrapped because they say it damages trade and threatens Northern Ireland's place in the UK union. DUP leader Mrs Foster accused Mr Sefcovic ofhaving his ""head in the sand"" over the issues, and called for Prime Minister Boris Johnson to ""step up"" to sort out the issues. But the EU has stood by this part of the post-Brexit trade agreement, finalised in December and coming into force on New Year's Day. In a joint statement after their meeting, Mr Gove and Mr Sefcovic reiterated their ""full commitment"" to the Good Friday Agreement and to the ""proper implementation"" of the Northern Ireland Protocol. They said this was necessary to ensure stability, prevent a hard border and ""impact as little as possible on the everyday life"" of people living on the island of Ireland. The statement also said they had ""taken in to account"" the views expressed by both the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister in Northern Ireland. It is understood Mr Gove and Mr Sefcovic will hold a virtual meeting with Northern Ireland business leaders next week, before further discussions on 24 February. Irish Foreign Minister, Simon Coveney, described the meeting as ""a good day's work"". In a tweet, he said the ""focus now"" was on ""cooperation to implement what's been agreed in the protocol... and to work on solutions to outstanding issues"". Sinn Fein's deputy first minister Michelle O'Neill said she welcomed the two sides' commitment to the Good Friday Agreement and implementation of the protocol ""protecting the gains of peace, and avoiding a hard border in Ireland"". SDLP leader Colum Eastwood told the BBC that the language of the statement was ""more constructive"", but Ulster Unionist Party leader Steve Aiken said the protocol was ""breaking"" Northern Ireland's links with Great Britain, which ""shouldn't be allowed to happen"".

"This video can not be played CEO Secrets: Bumble founder Whitney Wolfe says don't take yourself too seriously No bumbling here: Dating app Bumble, which made its name by putting women in charge of making contact with potential mates, has soared to a market value of more than $13bn after listing shares. Its Wall Street success made 31-year-old boss Whitney Wolfe Herd a rare self-made female billionaire. Bumble, which also owns Badoo, isone of less than two dozen US firms,externalto list publicly while led by a female founder. Shares in the firm debuted at $43 apiece, valuing it at over $8bn. But in opening trade on Thursday they shot up to more than $76 each, making the firm worth more than $13bn (Â£9.4bn). Ms Wolfe Herd launched Bumble in Texas in 2014, with backing from Russian billionaire Andreey Andreev, the founder of European online dating site Badoo. She has said she was inspired to create a platform where women ""make the first move"" by her frustration with archaic gender norms controlling dating. Unlike most dating apps, only female users can make the first contact with matched male users, while in same-sex matches either person can send a message first. ""I have experienced firsthand how unequal relationships negatively impact all areas of life,"" she wrote in a letter to investors ahead of the share listing. ""I wanted to change this."" Mature dating apps are coming of age Tinder boss says 'dramatic' changes to dating Ms Wolfe Herd, the youngest woman to take a company public in the US, also co-founded dating app Tinder, but left the firm alleging sexual harassment. Tinder's parent company Match Group Inc, which denied the claims and later tried unsuccessfully to acquire Bumble, paid about $1m to settle the dispute. Ms Wolfe Herd has led Bumble and Badoo since 2019 when Mr Andreev sold his stakes in both businesses to investment giant Blackstone. The two apps combined have 40 million active users, including more than 2.4 million paying customers. Bumble, whose apps are available in more than 150 countries, has said it is poised for growth, pointing to the rising number of single people globally, increased adoption of online dating and signs that users have become more willing to pay. The firm is also expanding into new areas, like business networking. But despite an uptick in use, the pandemic has hurt the business, which makes money primarily from subscriptions and in-app purchases. In 2019, revenue jumped more than 35% and it turned a profit of $68.6m. In the first nine months of 2020, however, its growth rate sank to roughly 15% year-on-year, and it posted a loss of $116m. In recent months, investors have displayed strong appetite for shares of new listings, sending companies such as Airbnb and Doordash to sky-high valuations in their market debuts.

"Amsterdam ousted London as the largest financial trading centre in Europe last month as Brexit-related changes to finance rules came into force. About â¬9.2bn (Â£8.1bn) worth of shares were traded on Amsterdam exchanges each day, against â¬8.6bn in London. Following new Brexit rules, EU-based banks wanting to buy European shares currently cannot trade via London, meaning a loss of fees for City firms. Bank of England chief Andrew Bailey has warned the EU not to cut off London. On Wednesday, Mr Bailey said there were signs that the EU planned to cut the UK off from its financial markets. Following the new Brexit trading rules coming into effect, there are talks to harmonise rules over financial regulations - so-called equivalence Both sides are working towards a March deadline to agree an ""equivalence"" regime under which the UK and Europe would recognise the other's regulations. Number 10, said it remained ""open"" to discussions with the EU on the equivalence issue. ""Despite the fact that we've supplied all of the necessary paperwork and are one of the world's most preeminent financial centres, with a strong regulatory system, the EU still haven't granted us full equivalence."" ""This has meant that some EU shares that were previously traded on UK venues have moved to the EU venues on advice of the European regulator, but our position is fragmentation of share trading across financial centres is in no one's interest,"" it added. It's called invisible trade - but selling services abroad is something the UK excels in, particularly when it comes to banking. Financial services makes up about 7% of the UK's income in total, and about 40% of banking and investment's business abroad is with the EU. But its needs were largely invisible from the deal struck with the EU at the end of last year. The diversion of share trading is the first visible, if inevitable, sign of the impact. And that business may not return to London. Even if the UK government and Brussels can ultimately reach agreement that financial services can get more access to each others markets, on the basis the UK's standards can be deemed ""equivalent"" to the EU's, share dealing may not be part of that. The UK government hopes Brexit will enhance the City's dominance, with scope to deepen relationships with other financial centres. But that's a work in progress. The boss of one share exchange described a recently-struck deal that allows Swiss shares to be traded in London as being like a free kick in a football match rather than an equaliser: it doesn't compensate for what has been lost in loosening ties with Europe. Mr Bailey said the City wanted to reach an agreement on financial rules, but would not accept being ""dictated"" to by Brussels. He said EU demands had so far been unreasonable. ""I'm afraid a world in which the EU dictates and determines which rules and standards we have in the UK isn't going to work,"" the governor said in his annual Mansion House speech to the City, this year held virtually. ""Is the EU going to cut the UK off from itself? There are signs of an intention to do so at the moment but I think that would be a mistake,"" he added. ""We have to state the argument for global standards and markets and openness and if we all sign up to that then there's no need to go in that direction."" Brexit: Barclays urges UK to focus on US and Asia How will London change after Brexit? Brexit 'crunch time' for City of London Financial services - a key driver of the UK economy - were largely omitted from the last-minute Brexit trade deal agreed in December. The City generates about Â£135bn in business annually, with financial institutions earning big fees from trading stocks and shares. But London's financial centre has been cut off from EU markets since 1 January. But Brussels says it will not be rushed into decisions on granting access for UK financial firms, as it wants to see how far UK rules will diverge from its own. It follows fears the UK will adopt a low-regulation Singapore-style model that would undercut the EU. Mr Bailey said the EU was holding the UK to unrealistically high standards on the issue of divergence, saying it would in effect make the City a ""rule taker"". He added that while some UK rules would change post-Brexit, sudden deregulation was not on the cards. ""Let me be clear, none of this means that the UK should or will create a low-regulation, high-risk, anything-goes financial centre and system,"" he said. ""We have an overwhelming body of evidence that such an approach is not in our own interests, let alone anyone else's."" Despite the current situation, Mr Bailey said that London would ""undoubtedly continue as one of the world's leading if not the leading financial centre"". Last month Mr Bailey said up to 7,000 finance jobs had so far been relocated from London to rival centres in the EU - well down on predictions of as many as 50,000 losses.

Have a good evening from all of us. We're going to be closing the live page soon so here's a
look back at some of the coronavirus news we've brought you today:  The number of cases and deaths in the UK is starting to dip. You can use ourlook up toolto find out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average. Coronavirus prompted thousands of people to offer their services to help the NHS through the pandemic. And it inspired one mother and daughter to join nursing courses at the same university. Tracy Alexander, 49, chose to specialise in child nursing, while her daughter Sarah, 22, has pursued adult nursing - both at Liverpool John Moores University. They are both in their first year and began their studies in September. Sarah said it was ""nice to have someone who understands"" when she comes home after a day of lessons. This video can not be played Liverpool mum and daughter become nursing students together The closure of the hospitality sector during lockdown is having a knock-on effect on food producers. One - the Cornish Cheese Company - is warning that it has two tonnes of cheese at risk of being thrown away. Cornish Blue cheese takes about 10 weeks to mature and then has to be sold within six weeks. The firm usually sells 80% of its product to the hospitality sector and said the cheese would go off within two to three weeks. Ben Stansfield said: ""Normally we could sell this easily with all the wholesalers open, but it is all going to go off within two to three weeks. ""We are trying our best to not have to throw any away but we won't be able to sell it after that and you can't freeze two tonnes of cheese."" Find out morehere. A mother who suffocated her disabled son is said to have reached her ""wits' end"" during lockdown last year. Dylan Freeman's body was found in Acton, west London, on 16 August. His mother Olga Freemanpleaded guilty at the Old Bailey to manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibilityand has been detained in hospital indefinitely. The judge said Dylan was ""an indirect victim of interruption to normal life caused by the Covid-19 pandemic."" Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb said it was a""rare and desperately sad"" case. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent Simon Ashley and his twin boys - Ralph and Henry With twin boys approaching the age of two, Simon Ashley and his wife Katie realised they needed more space at home and decided to take advantage of the stamp duty holiday to move to a bigger property. But, along with many thousands of people also planning to move during the pandemic, theynow face a race to beat the deadline at the end of March. ""The stamp duty holiday is a big thing for us. To put it bluntly, the impact is just over Â£12,000,"" said Simon, aged 34. ""It is making us nervous."" The tax concession in England and Northern Ireland means no stamp duty is paid on the first Â£500,000 of a property sale. In Scotland and Wales the equivalent levies have had breaks too but all are set to return to their pre-pandemic thresholds on 1 April. More than five million people have fallen into a ""fragile"" financial position owing to the coronavirus crisis, with young working adults among the hardest hit, the Financial Conduct Authority warns. ItsFinancial Lives survey,externalis a benchmark for the state of the nation's finance and it says people from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds were also more seriously affected than others. The regulator says ""the pain is not being shared equally"". It warns an estimated 14.2 million people are vulnerable to afinancial shock. Stormont ministers will take a ""collective approach"" when reviewing Northern Ireland's lockdown restrictions next week, finance minister Conor Murphy has said. NI re-entered lockdown on 26 December, with the measures due to last until 5 March. But ministers will meet on Thursday to review what should happen beyond that point. First Minister Arlene Foster said there needed to be one more ""push"" to reduce infection rates as much as possible. She said next Thursday's executive meeting would be a ""key decision point"" about how Northern Ireland emerges from lockdown. A pathway to recovery document is due to be published by the executive in the coming weeks, with many businesses asking for clarity around indicative reopening dates. Read more Sweden has been rolling out vaccines since December Coronavirus deaths appear to be declining in Sweden as more elderly people receive vaccinations against the disease, health officials say. Another 44 Covid-19 deaths were registered on Thursday, bringing the total to 12,370 in Sweden. But deaths have been steadily declining since December, when more than 100 a day were being recorded, World Health Organization data showed. âWe can in good conscience say that this type of decrease should be due to the vaccines,â chief epidemiologist Anders Tegnell said, adding: âIt also follows what we have seen in Israel and other countries.â Sweden has prioritised vaccinating people in nursing homes, where many of the countryâs deaths have occurred. The coronavirus death rate in Sweden is higher than that of its Nordic neighbours, but lower than some European countries that imposed tight restrictions. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The latest daily Covid figures for the UK show continued progress, with just under 13,500 new infections reported. It means week on week there has been a drop of approaching a third â and this compares to an average of nearly 60,000 infections a day at the start of the year. The number of new deaths confirmed is 678. Daily figures do jump around a little but the average for the past week is now well below 800 a day, compared with more than 1,200 a few weeks ago. Could vaccination be playing a role? At the moment, there is nothing to clearly suggest it is â or at least not in a significant way. The drop seems to be largely driven by lockdown. But in the coming weeks expect that to change. The falls â at least in terms of hospital cases and deaths â could soon become even more marked. Vitaliy ShevchenkoBBC Monitoring In a rare update on the progress of Russia's vaccination
campaign, an official has said that more than 1.7 million Russians have been
fully vaccinated against coronavirus. Denis
Logunov from the state-run Gamaleya Centre, which developed Russia's Sputnik V
vaccine, was speaking at a meeting organised by the ruling United Russia party
at the Moscow City Council. He said some 2.2 million residents of the country
had received the first of two jabs. Officials
have so far been tight-lipped about the exact number of Russians who have been
vaccinated, and Logunovâs data suggests that Russia is lagging far
behind in the race to vaccinate against Covid-19. According to figures,external, fewer than 1.5% of the population in Russia have
received anti-coronavirus shots, compared to 69.5% in Israel, 47.4% in the UAE,
20% in the UK, 13.4% in the US, 5.6% in Chile and 2.8% in China. The daily figures also show a total of 13,509,108 people have now received the first dose of a vaccine in the UK - a rise of 450,810 compared with yesterday. The data wastweeted,externalby Public Health England, rather than published on the government's coronavirus dashboard as it normally is. PHE said due to a technical difficulty, the dashboard was expected to be updated at 18:00 GMT. A further 678 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, according to the latest government figures, which weretweeted by Public Health England,external. It takes the death toll by that measure to 115,529. There were also a further 13,494 cases reported. On Wednesday, 1,001 deaths and 13,013 cases were reported.   Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor In normal times, you probably wouldn't think it's any business of a politician's to tell you when, or when not, to book a summer holiday. The pandemic, of course, has changed all that - you can look still, but you may well not want to book. Health Secretary Matt Hancockhas said it's ""too early"" to knowwhether summer holidays can go ahead. His comments came after both the PM and Grant Shapps pleaded with people not to ""go ahead and book holidays"". Ministers' remarks clash with each other - in emphasis or fact sometimes - because they just do not know exactly what the situation will be, so they have no solid decision to explain. And if they don't know, well there's not much they can tell us. Read more from Laura's bloghere.  Prisoners in England's jails have been locked in their cells for more than 90% of the day to keep them safe from Covid-19, the prisons watchdog says. And the extra restrictions, which began in March, have led to a decline in their mental and physical health and a rise in drug taking and self-harm. ""It's being imprisoned while you're in prison,"" one inmate told inspectors. Predictions up to 2,000 inmates would die in the pandemic in England and Wales without action have been avoided. But inspectors who visited a cross-section of jails, interviewing male and female prisoners as well as young offenders, found the long-term consequences of such an extended and restrictive regime could be ""profound"", with some newly-released offenders ill-prepared for life outside. Normally, adult prisoners should spend between eight and 10 hours a day outside their cells. Meanwhile, at HMP Bullingdon in Oxfordshire a 52-year-old inmate hasdied following an outbreak of the virus. Read more  Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst The clock has struck midnight (16:00 GMT) in China, ushering in the Lunar New Year. It is normally the happiest time of the year in China, when families gather to have meals and set off fireworks. But because of coronavirus outbreaks in the country's north-east, many people will be celebrating alone this year. A âunique but safeâ new year is how some state media outlets have been framing the occasion. On the bright side, it has been four days since China recorded a domestically transmitted case of the coronavirus. So, with China's vaccination programme well under way, there is a lot of optimism for the Year of the Ox. As for the Year of the Rat, state media outlets appear to be pleased to see the back of it. On its Weibo account, the Peopleâs Daily newspaper posted a cartoon of an ox chasing a rat carrying parcels, and a coronavirus, out of an apartment. Meanwhile, in a reminder of more normal times, the annual New Year countdown show - the Spring Festival gala - returned to being the large-scale spectacle audiences expect it to be. Celebrations - more scaled down than usual - were seen across China to mark to Lunar New Year We've been hearing today about how England'squarantine hotel launch has been going- its booking website was taken offline just after launch. The quarantine measure is one of a growing number aimed at stopping the spread of new, potentially more-resistant Covid strains from other countries. From Monday, UK residents and Irish nationals who have been in33 red-list countries,externalin the 10 days before travelling will have to quarantine in hotelsselected by the government,external- at a cost of Â£1,750. They can only enter the UK at five airports: Heathrow, Gatwick, London City, Birmingham and Farnborough Airfield. Despite all this, UK travel providers say they are stillseeing strong demand for summer getaways later in the year. There is more on UK travel ruleshere. Germany has banned arrivals from countries with outbreaks of highly transmissible coronavirus variants The German government will impose a ban on travel from the Czech Republic and the Austrian region of Tyrol, Interior Minister Horst Seehofer has told local media. ""The states of Bavaria and Saxony today asked the government to class Tyrol and the border regions of the Czech Republic as virus mutation areas, and to implement border controls,"" Seehofer told the SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung newspaper on Thursday. He said the border controls, which have been approved by Chancellor Angela Merkel, will come into force on Sunday. Germany in late January banned most travellers from countries with the highest numbers of new, more contagious coronavirus variants. Only a handful of exceptions are allowed to enter Germany from these countries, including returning nationals and essential workers. The UK, where a highly contagious variant of the virus was first detected last year, is subject to such a travel ban. There are fears that vaccines are not as effective against some coronavirus variants, such as the one found in South Africa. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent For most government announcements, a day here or there might not make much difference. But nobody wants to wait any longer than necessary for the promised ""roadmap"" to take England out of lockdown. So when the prime minister promised that ""on 22 February"" he would reveal that plan, Conservative MPs were among those marking their diaries. But now Downing Street has said the roadmap will come ""on the week of the 22nd"". In response Tory backbenchers are warning the government not to ""backslide"" on its promise. They want to hold ministers to their aim of giving schools two weeks' notice before re-opening to all pupils on 8 March. A vocal minority of Conservative MPs have argued the current lockdown is too strict and needs to lift as soon as possible. Others have been more patient, but the further cases fall, the more people get the vaccine and the longer time goes on, the more pressure on the government will grow. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Police found Dylan Freeman in his mother's bed surrounded by toys A mother who suffocated her disabled 10-year-old boy after reaching her ""wits' end"" during lockdown has been detained in hospital indefinitely. Dylan Freeman's body was found in Acton, west London, on 16 August with a sponge in his mouth. His mother Olga Freemanpleaded guilty at the Old Bailey to manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility. The judge said Dylan was ""an indirect victim of interruption to normal life caused by the Covid-19 pandemic."" Freeman was sentenced to a hospital order under theMental Health Act,externalwithout a limit of time. Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb said it was a ""rare and desperately sad"" case. Dylan had autism, Cohen syndrome - which is linked to abnormalities in many parts of the body - and significant difficulties with language and communication. Olga Freeman had booked flights abroad the night before Dylan's body was found Prosecutor Gareth Patterson QC said Dylan required round-the-clock care and had attended a special school five days a week but had been unable to go during the lockdown as it had shut. This took a toll on Freeman, the court heard. Mr Patterson added: ""Last year during the first lockdown and through the summer she struggled more and more with her son. ""Eventually she suffered a mental health breakdown."" Dylan's body was found at a house in Cumberland Park, Acton Police found Dylan in a bedroom lying on his back covered by a duvet after Freeman had walked into a police station to report she had killed her child. A post-mortem found he died from restriction of the airways frompieces of sponge that had been stuffed in his mouth. Psychiatrist Dr Martin Lock said Freeman had ""developed psychotic symptoms when under very heavy stress because of the Covid-19 lockdown"". Requests were made to increase support for Dylan's care but Ealing Council appeared to be ""slow"" in responding, the court heard. Mr Patterson said: ""The council does seem to have been slow in determining her requests for increased financial assistance and she felt let down by the council."" The court heard a serious case review was expected to conclude shortly. Sentencing Freeman, Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb said the burden of looking after Dylan meant she had reached her ""wits' end"". She added: ""I have no doubt at all that you were a remarkably loving and dedicated mother to a vulnerable child until multiple pressures overwhelmed you and your mind was swamped by a destructive illness with florid psychotic elements."" Mother admits suffocating son with sponge Murder accused mum's son 'had restricted airways' Murder accused mum 'admitted killing in call' After sentencing, Ealing Council said Dylan had received 30 hours of care a week - 16 of which were council-funded. ""It is clear from the evidence from the review so far, that this death could not have been foreseen,"" it said. ""This tragic incident reflects the most extreme and traumatic aspect of the challenges experienced by many parents in trying to do their best to care for their children during a global pandemic.""

"This video can not be played Hancock on holiday uncertainty: ""People are smarter than all that."" It is ""too early"" to know whether summer holidays can go ahead, the health secretary has said. Matt Hancock said there was still ""a lot of uncertainty"" but ministers were doing everything possible to make sure people could have a holiday this year. He told the BBC he had booked his own summer break in Cornwall ""months ago"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer urged the government to ""get rid of the mixed messages"" about whether people should book holidays for later in the year. Some Tory MPs and businesses also criticised the government for fuelling uncertainty for travel companies already struggling in the pandemic. It follows confusion after Transport Secretary Grant Shapps warned ""people shouldn't be booking holidays right now - not domestically or internationally"". Downing Street said Prime Minister Boris Johnson would unveil a roadmap for easing restrictions - potentially including travel - in the week beginning 22 February. Analysis by BBC political correspondent Jonathan Blake For most announcements from the government, a day here or there might not make much difference. But nobody wants to wait any longer than necessary for the promised ""roadmap"" to take England out of lockdown. So when the prime minister promised that ""on 22 February"" he would reveal that plan, Conservative MPs were among those marking their diaries. But now Downing Street has said the roadmap will come ""on the week of the 22nd"" - which isn't quite the same. In response, Tory backbenchers are warning the government not to ""backslide"" on its promise. They want to hold ministers to their aim of giving schools two weeks' notice before re-opening to all pupils on 8 March. A vocal minority of Conservative MPs have argued the current lockdown is too strict and needs to lift as soon as possible. Others have been more patient and kept faith the government will take the right decisions at the right time. But the further cases fall, the more people get the vaccine and the longer time goes on, the more pressure on the government will grow. Mr Hancock told BBC Breakfast it was too early to know which coronavirus restrictions may still be in place over the summer, but that he understood people wanted to make plans. ""People are yearning for certainty over whether they can have a summer holiday"", he said, but ""pandemics are difficult times and there is a lot of uncertainty"". ""We are doing everything that we possibly can to make sure that people can have a holiday this summer but the vaccine rollout is absolutely essential to that,"" he continued. The health secretary also said that, before summer holidays, the priority would be making sure people can see loved ones again - but it was too early to say when this might happen. Holiday bookings jump despite 'unclear rules' Don't book holiday yet, government warns Starmer: 10-year Covid jail terms 'empty threat' The latest government figures,externalshow a total of 13,509,108 people have now received the first dose of a vaccine in the UK - a rise of 450,810 from Wednesday. The UK also reported another 678 people had died within 28 days of a positive Covid test, along with a further 13,494 new daily cases. Sir Jeremy Farrar, a member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said cases needed to fall below 10,000 a day before the UK should consider easing lockdown measures, with transmission rates still ""incredibly high"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it ""doesn't make any sense"" to set out plans to ease restrictions with arbitrary dates in March or April, adding that ""the data has to drive us"". ""In 2020 we lifted restrictions too quickly... as a result the transmission went back up in this country,"" he said. Dawn Dillon, from Surrey, says her husband booked a holiday to Spain in June 2019 for the following year as her birthday present. They were able to move the trip, which cost Â£1,000 for accommodation and flights, from 2020 to June 2021. ""But what do we do now - will we lose our holiday?"" she asks. ""I know it's not a priority but it would be nice to have some clarity."" Dawn, who is 55 and asthmatic, says she had anticipated that she would have had a Covid vaccine, along with her husband, before the trip in June. ""But you don't know how advanced the vaccination process is in other countries,"" she adds. Mr Johnson told a Downing Street briefing on Wednesday that as far as holidays were concerned, people would have to be a ""little bit more patient"". The PM's official spokesman said Mr Johnson does not have a holiday planned but ""is obviously keen to have a break over the summer"". But Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth criticised ministers for not being clearer about what the public could plan for. He said he had yet to book a holiday because he was ""in the same boat as everyone else"". Sir Keir said he had a ""holding"" booking for a break in Devon in August that is ""subject to restrictions, that's the best anybody can do"". Senior Conservative MP Sir Charles Walker accused ministers of ""ripping out"" the goalposts on the timetable for lifting Covid restrictions. People ""need to have something to look forward to"", he said. Matt Hancock has already booked a holiday to Cornwall after predicting a ""Great British summer"" One travel industry leader criticised the government's plea for people to stop making summer plansas ""puerile and nonsensical"". And Heathrow Airport's chief executive said getting back to normality was not just about people's holidays but also to ""protect people's businesses and livelihood"". Meanwhile, Henry Joce, of Tencreek Holiday Park and Campsite in Cornwall, told BBC Radio 5 Live it may be too late, not too soon, to book a spot there over certain dates this summer. He said soaring demand for breaks over the past fortnight meant he was at risk of selling out during peak weeks, which he put down to people ""being desperate to get away"".

"University of Hull student Libby Squire was last seen in the early hours of 1 February 2019 A serial sex offender has been found guilty of raping and murdering a student before dumping her body in a river. Pawel Relowicz, 26, prowled the streets of Hull before attacking ""vulnerable"" 21-year-old Libby Squire. Jurors heard Relowicz had committed a string of offences against women prior to the killing. Speaking outside Sheffield Crown Court, Libby's mother paid tribute to her ""beautiful, caring, wonderful girl"". During the trial, prosecutor Richard Wright QC said Relowicz had spent the night of 31 January 2019 driving around looking for a woman to attack. The killer at the window Jurors heard University of Hull philosophy student Ms Squire, who had been turned away from a nightclub, was drunk and ""extremely vulnerable"" when Relowicz ""intercepted"" her . He drove her to Oak Road playing fields, where he attacked her before putting her in the River Hull. Prosecutors said the married father-of-two had repeatedly lied to police, his wife and in court documents about what happened on the night of Ms Squire's disappearance. Pawel Relowicz had previously committed a string of sexual offences against women He maintained he had consensual sex with the student and said he had lied because he did not want his wife to find out he had cheated on her. After a massive search effort, Ms Squire's remains were found in the Humber Estuary almost two months later. Her parents, Lisa and Russ, held hands and cried as they sat in the public gallery overlooking the courtroom to await the verdicts. Speaking outside court, Mrs Squire thanked supporters but said Relowicz's conviction ""changes nothing for us, there is no closure"". ""We don't get to have Libby back and our lives don't revert back to normal,"" she said. ""Libby will always be with us and we are all so proud of our beautiful, caring, wonderful girl.

In a statement, Humberside Police said it was ""satisfied"" with its investigation and that officers ""acted quickly"" to identify, locate and apprehend the defendant within days of Ms Squire's disappearance. Det Supt Martin Smalley said: ""I can understand that people are interested to know whether Libby's tragic death could have been prevented.

"This video can not be played Covid: Vaccine supplies could see roll-out 'slowdown' Scotland's vaccination programme is likely to slow down later this month because of supply problems, the first minister has warned. Nicola Sturgeon said a ""temporary reduction"" in Pfizer's manufacturing capacity meant the country had received slightly lower stocks of the vaccine than expected. This means the number of vaccination appointments is likely to be reduced. But Ms Sturgeon said Scotland is still on track to hit its vaccine targets. And she said the country would be able to ""rapidly accelerate"" the vaccination programme again if supplies increase again. A further 63,178 people had their first dose of the vaccine on Wednesday - the highest in a single day so fardespite the bad weather- bringing the total in Scotland to 1,048,747. The figure for the UK as a whole stands at more than 13 million. How many people have been vaccinated in Scotland? Nearly a quarter (23%) of all adults in Scotland have had their first dose, including about 97% of over 80-year-olds, 87% of those aged between 75 and 79 and 54% of 70 to 74-year-olds. Ms Sturgeon said the figures meant that Scotland had given the first dose to 75,000 more people than than had originally been expected by this stage. And she said it gave ""real hope"" that the vaccine will soon start to have an impact on the number of people dying or becoming seriously ill with the virus. A record number of people were vaccinated on Wednesday despite many parts of the country seeing extreme weather conditions But she said the higher than expected take-up, alongside reduced supplies of the Pfizer jab and the need to preserve some stocks for second doses, meant that ""we may need to reduce the number of appointments that we schedule over the next few weeks"". The first minister added: ""This sort of issue is not unexpected, given the huge complexities that the vaccination programme throws up. ""Importantly, we remain on course to meet the key targets we have set out. ""And we still anticipate, subject to supply, that everyone over the age of 50 will have received their first dose by early May."" It was revealed last month that the UK was set to face short-term delays in delivery of the Pfizer jab as the pharmaceutical company upgraded its production capacity. Pfizer is upscaling production at its plant in Puurs, Belgium, in efforts to produce more doses than originally planned for 2021 - temporarily reducing deliveries to all European countries. The American firm said at the time that this would mean ""fewer doses will be available for European countries at the end of January and the beginning of February.""

She added: ""That will reduce our expected supply next week and the week after by about somewhere between 120,000 and 190,000 doses a week overall over the two vaccines."" But the UK government said it was ""confident of our vaccine supply"" and that it would be able to hit its target of vaccinating everyone in the top four priority groups by next Monday. The prime minister's official spokesman said: ""We are confident of supplies but we haven't commented on details of delivery schedules or movements of the vaccines."" And a spokeswoman from Northern Ireland's Department of Health said: ""We are not aware of any Pfizer supply issues and are continuing to work through the priority groups as planned."" Meanwhile, the deaths of a further 48 people in Scotland who had previously tested positive for the virus have been recorded in the past 24 hours, bringing the total by that measure to 6,599. However, only 4% of the tests carried out on Wednesday returned positive results - down from 4.8% the previous day. The R number - effectively the rate at which the virus is transmitted - continues to be below one. And the number of people in hospital wards with the virus has now fallen slightly below the peak from the first wave last year, with the number of patients in ICU units also gradually falling.

Have a good evening from all of us. We're going to be closing the live page soon so here's a
look back at some of the coronavirus news we've brought you today:  The number of cases and deaths in the UK is starting to dip. You can use ourlook up toolto find out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average. Coronavirus prompted thousands of people to offer their services to help the NHS through the pandemic. And it inspired one mother and daughter to join nursing courses at the same university. Tracy Alexander, 49, chose to specialise in child nursing, while her daughter Sarah, 22, has pursued adult nursing - both at Liverpool John Moores University. They are both in their first year and began their studies in September. Sarah said it was ""nice to have someone who understands"" when she comes home after a day of lessons. This video can not be played Liverpool mum and daughter become nursing students together The closure of the hospitality sector during lockdown is having a knock-on effect on food producers. One - the Cornish Cheese Company - is warning that it has two tonnes of cheese at risk of being thrown away. Cornish Blue cheese takes about 10 weeks to mature and then has to be sold within six weeks. The firm usually sells 80% of its product to the hospitality sector and said the cheese would go off within two to three weeks. Ben Stansfield said: ""Normally we could sell this easily with all the wholesalers open, but it is all going to go off within two to three weeks. ""We are trying our best to not have to throw any away but we won't be able to sell it after that and you can't freeze two tonnes of cheese."" Find out morehere. A mother who suffocated her disabled son is said to have reached her ""wits' end"" during lockdown last year. Dylan Freeman's body was found in Acton, west London, on 16 August. His mother Olga Freemanpleaded guilty at the Old Bailey to manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibilityand has been detained in hospital indefinitely. The judge said Dylan was ""an indirect victim of interruption to normal life caused by the Covid-19 pandemic."" Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb said it was a""rare and desperately sad"" case. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent Simon Ashley and his twin boys - Ralph and Henry With twin boys approaching the age of two, Simon Ashley and his wife Katie realised they needed more space at home and decided to take advantage of the stamp duty holiday to move to a bigger property. But, along with many thousands of people also planning to move during the pandemic, theynow face a race to beat the deadline at the end of March. ""The stamp duty holiday is a big thing for us. To put it bluntly, the impact is just over Â£12,000,"" said Simon, aged 34. ""It is making us nervous."" The tax concession in England and Northern Ireland means no stamp duty is paid on the first Â£500,000 of a property sale. In Scotland and Wales the equivalent levies have had breaks too but all are set to return to their pre-pandemic thresholds on 1 April. More than five million people have fallen into a ""fragile"" financial position owing to the coronavirus crisis, with young working adults among the hardest hit, the Financial Conduct Authority warns. ItsFinancial Lives survey,externalis a benchmark for the state of the nation's finance and it says people from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds were also more seriously affected than others. The regulator says ""the pain is not being shared equally"". It warns an estimated 14.2 million people are vulnerable to afinancial shock. Stormont ministers will take a ""collective approach"" when reviewing Northern Ireland's lockdown restrictions next week, finance minister Conor Murphy has said. NI re-entered lockdown on 26 December, with the measures due to last until 5 March. But ministers will meet on Thursday to review what should happen beyond that point. First Minister Arlene Foster said there needed to be one more ""push"" to reduce infection rates as much as possible. She said next Thursday's executive meeting would be a ""key decision point"" about how Northern Ireland emerges from lockdown. A pathway to recovery document is due to be published by the executive in the coming weeks, with many businesses asking for clarity around indicative reopening dates. Read more Sweden has been rolling out vaccines since December Coronavirus deaths appear to be declining in Sweden as more elderly people receive vaccinations against the disease, health officials say. Another 44 Covid-19 deaths were registered on Thursday, bringing the total to 12,370 in Sweden. But deaths have been steadily declining since December, when more than 100 a day were being recorded, World Health Organization data showed. âWe can in good conscience say that this type of decrease should be due to the vaccines,â chief epidemiologist Anders Tegnell said, adding: âIt also follows what we have seen in Israel and other countries.â Sweden has prioritised vaccinating people in nursing homes, where many of the countryâs deaths have occurred. The coronavirus death rate in Sweden is higher than that of its Nordic neighbours, but lower than some European countries that imposed tight restrictions. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The latest daily Covid figures for the UK show continued progress, with just under 13,500 new infections reported. It means week on week there has been a drop of approaching a third â and this compares to an average of nearly 60,000 infections a day at the start of the year. The number of new deaths confirmed is 678. Daily figures do jump around a little but the average for the past week is now well below 800 a day, compared with more than 1,200 a few weeks ago. Could vaccination be playing a role? At the moment, there is nothing to clearly suggest it is â or at least not in a significant way. The drop seems to be largely driven by lockdown. But in the coming weeks expect that to change. The falls â at least in terms of hospital cases and deaths â could soon become even more marked. Vitaliy ShevchenkoBBC Monitoring In a rare update on the progress of Russia's vaccination
campaign, an official has said that more than 1.7 million Russians have been
fully vaccinated against coronavirus. Denis
Logunov from the state-run Gamaleya Centre, which developed Russia's Sputnik V
vaccine, was speaking at a meeting organised by the ruling United Russia party
at the Moscow City Council. He said some 2.2 million residents of the country
had received the first of two jabs. Officials
have so far been tight-lipped about the exact number of Russians who have been
vaccinated, and Logunovâs data suggests that Russia is lagging far
behind in the race to vaccinate against Covid-19. According to figures,external, fewer than 1.5% of the population in Russia have
received anti-coronavirus shots, compared to 69.5% in Israel, 47.4% in the UAE,
20% in the UK, 13.4% in the US, 5.6% in Chile and 2.8% in China. The daily figures also show a total of 13,509,108 people have now received the first dose of a vaccine in the UK - a rise of 450,810 compared with yesterday. The data wastweeted,externalby Public Health England, rather than published on the government's coronavirus dashboard as it normally is. PHE said due to a technical difficulty, the dashboard was expected to be updated at 18:00 GMT. A further 678 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, according to the latest government figures, which weretweeted by Public Health England,external. It takes the death toll by that measure to 115,529. There were also a further 13,494 cases reported. On Wednesday, 1,001 deaths and 13,013 cases were reported.   Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor In normal times, you probably wouldn't think it's any business of a politician's to tell you when, or when not, to book a summer holiday. The pandemic, of course, has changed all that - you can look still, but you may well not want to book. Health Secretary Matt Hancockhas said it's ""too early"" to knowwhether summer holidays can go ahead. His comments came after both the PM and Grant Shapps pleaded with people not to ""go ahead and book holidays"". Ministers' remarks clash with each other - in emphasis or fact sometimes - because they just do not know exactly what the situation will be, so they have no solid decision to explain. And if they don't know, well there's not much they can tell us. Read more from Laura's bloghere.  Prisoners in England's jails have been locked in their cells for more than 90% of the day to keep them safe from Covid-19, the prisons watchdog says. And the extra restrictions, which began in March, have led to a decline in their mental and physical health and a rise in drug taking and self-harm. ""It's being imprisoned while you're in prison,"" one inmate told inspectors. Predictions up to 2,000 inmates would die in the pandemic in England and Wales without action have been avoided. But inspectors who visited a cross-section of jails, interviewing male and female prisoners as well as young offenders, found the long-term consequences of such an extended and restrictive regime could be ""profound"", with some newly-released offenders ill-prepared for life outside. Normally, adult prisoners should spend between eight and 10 hours a day outside their cells. Meanwhile, at HMP Bullingdon in Oxfordshire a 52-year-old inmate hasdied following an outbreak of the virus. Read more  Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst The clock has struck midnight (16:00 GMT) in China, ushering in the Lunar New Year. It is normally the happiest time of the year in China, when families gather to have meals and set off fireworks. But because of coronavirus outbreaks in the country's north-east, many people will be celebrating alone this year. A âunique but safeâ new year is how some state media outlets have been framing the occasion. On the bright side, it has been four days since China recorded a domestically transmitted case of the coronavirus. So, with China's vaccination programme well under way, there is a lot of optimism for the Year of the Ox. As for the Year of the Rat, state media outlets appear to be pleased to see the back of it. On its Weibo account, the Peopleâs Daily newspaper posted a cartoon of an ox chasing a rat carrying parcels, and a coronavirus, out of an apartment. Meanwhile, in a reminder of more normal times, the annual New Year countdown show - the Spring Festival gala - returned to being the large-scale spectacle audiences expect it to be. Celebrations - more scaled down than usual - were seen across China to mark to Lunar New Year We've been hearing today about how England'squarantine hotel launch has been going- its booking website was taken offline just after launch. The quarantine measure is one of a growing number aimed at stopping the spread of new, potentially more-resistant Covid strains from other countries. From Monday, UK residents and Irish nationals who have been in33 red-list countries,externalin the 10 days before travelling will have to quarantine in hotelsselected by the government,external- at a cost of Â£1,750. They can only enter the UK at five airports: Heathrow, Gatwick, London City, Birmingham and Farnborough Airfield. Despite all this, UK travel providers say they are stillseeing strong demand for summer getaways later in the year. There is more on UK travel ruleshere. Germany has banned arrivals from countries with outbreaks of highly transmissible coronavirus variants The German government will impose a ban on travel from the Czech Republic and the Austrian region of Tyrol, Interior Minister Horst Seehofer has told local media. ""The states of Bavaria and Saxony today asked the government to class Tyrol and the border regions of the Czech Republic as virus mutation areas, and to implement border controls,"" Seehofer told the SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung newspaper on Thursday. He said the border controls, which have been approved by Chancellor Angela Merkel, will come into force on Sunday. Germany in late January banned most travellers from countries with the highest numbers of new, more contagious coronavirus variants. Only a handful of exceptions are allowed to enter Germany from these countries, including returning nationals and essential workers. The UK, where a highly contagious variant of the virus was first detected last year, is subject to such a travel ban. There are fears that vaccines are not as effective against some coronavirus variants, such as the one found in South Africa. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent For most government announcements, a day here or there might not make much difference. But nobody wants to wait any longer than necessary for the promised ""roadmap"" to take England out of lockdown. So when the prime minister promised that ""on 22 February"" he would reveal that plan, Conservative MPs were among those marking their diaries. But now Downing Street has said the roadmap will come ""on the week of the 22nd"". In response Tory backbenchers are warning the government not to ""backslide"" on its promise. They want to hold ministers to their aim of giving schools two weeks' notice before re-opening to all pupils on 8 March. A vocal minority of Conservative MPs have argued the current lockdown is too strict and needs to lift as soon as possible. Others have been more patient, but the further cases fall, the more people get the vaccine and the longer time goes on, the more pressure on the government will grow. Â© 2025 BBC.

But until proceedings pick back up again tomorrow, here's a selection of our best explainers and features to check out: For four years, Mike Pence was a loyal vice-president to Donald Trump. He smoothed the rough edges of the Trump presidency, and Trump's supporters loved him for it. But on 6 January, the pro-Trump mob at the Capitol branded him a traitor, even chanting ""hang Mike Pence"". So what changed? This video can not be played How Mike Pence became a villain in Trump world There is at least one more full day left in the Senate trial, but the final outcome is all but set. Despite some acknowledgement from Republicans that Democratic impeachment managers have made powerful arguments, there's no indication it has changed any minds. Republican senators are still insisting that the trial remains unconstitutional, since Trump is now a private citizen, and is therefore a waste of time.

Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington In their brief, Trumpâs lawyers used a time-honoured defence: their client, they argued, was âmisunderstoodâ. They also spelled United States wrong calling it the âUnites Statesâ, another sign of a hastily-put together document. They are planning to wrap up their argument in one day, a surprisingly short time, given the enormity of the charge - and one less day than they were allotted. The Democrats have built a detailed case against the former president over two days, with their arguments supported by chilling video of the violent assault on the Capitol. In contrast, when we heard from the defence earlier this week one lawyer, Bruce Castor, rambled, and even seemed confused. Trump was reportedly furious. You canread more about the scathing reviews here. Later, Castor insisted on Fox News that his client did in fact approve of their work, despite what people were saying. It was hardly a strong message - but heâll have a second chance to impress on Friday. We've heard a lot of people speak about Donald Trump over the past few days, but the man himself has been out of sight. Banned from Twitter, Trump has not shared his thoughts about the trial or much of anything else in his post-presidency. Here's what we do know. The former president now lives in Florida and on Tuesday he received some good news whenthe Palm Beach city council voted to allow his permanent residency at his club, Mar-a-Lago. Earlier today, according to CNN, he was spotted by one of their network's photographer playing a round of golf at his West Palm Beach course. He has declined to testify in the ongoing impeachment trial in Washington DC, with his lawyers slamming it as ""a publicity stunt"". Their defence starts tomorrow, but Trump will not be present. It remains unclear how much of the trial he is watching. Jessica Watkins (centre) is facing trial for conspiracy over the 6 January riot An alleged leader
of a paramilitary group that stormed the Capitol spoke of waiting for direction
from President Trump, prosecutors have said in a court filing. Jessica Watkins was
among a number of so-called Oath Keepers who changed into military dress and
walked on the Capitol after listening to Donald Trumpâs speech on 6 January. She was later seen
on a self-shot video in the Capitol building, and heard saying via walkie-talkie: ""We have a good groupâ¦ Sticking together and sticking to the plan."" The 38-year-old army veteran from Ohio has been charged with conspiracy. Prosecutors said,
ina document supporting her detention and published by CNN,external, she had ""trained and plotted for a
moment like this"". The document also
referenced a message she wrote after the November election expressing her
concern about taking action without Trumpâs backing: ""The [president] has the right
to activate units too. If Trump asks me to come, I will. Otherwise, I canât
trust it."" Jessica Watkins is a former army veteran Democratic prosecutors of Trump's second impeachment trial accused him of inciting the 6 January riots on Capitol Hill with a barrage of incendiary speeches and tweets following his election loss. The former president's lawyers will argue on Friday that he was exercising freedom of speech by calling the election a fraud, and never directly told his supporters to enter the Capitol building. Read more about the Oath Keepers and other US militia groups here. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter The House impeachment managers have finished presenting their case over the course of about 13 hours. Donald Trumpâs defence team will now get its turn. His lawyers will have up to 16 hours over two days to offer a rebuttal, although theyâre already saying they plan to wrap up by Friday evening. They feel like theyâre winning â and, if listening to Republican senators is any indication, theyâre probably right. After Trumpâs side finishes, senators will have up to four hours to present written questions to the legal teams. That will be followed by a debate and vote over whether to allow witnesses - if either side wants them. If they donât, or if the vote fails, both sides will make brief closing arguments followed by the final vote on Trumpâs fate. All told, this could wrap up as early as Saturday night or by Monday at the latest â less than a week from start to finish. That stands in stark contrast to Trumpâs last trial, which took three weeks, or President Andrew Johnsonâs proceedings in 1868, which had witnesses and took more than two months. Most of the Senate seems ready to move on as soon as possible â and it looks like theyâll get their wish. Barbara Plett UsherBBC News, US Capitol Democrats argued today that one of the reasons Donald Trump should be impeached is because he has damaged Americaâs standing in the international community. They said insurrectionists incited by Trump showed how easy it was to penetrate an American government building and foreign adversaries were probably taking notes. They argued that his actions gave authoritarian governments ammunition to defend their policies. China, for example, could more easily condemn democracy activists in Hong Kong as insurrectionists, said Congressman Joaquin Castro on the Senate floor, and Iran is mocking us. The world is watching to see whether rule of law prevails over rule of the mob in the United States â thatâs what weâre showing the world if we convict Donald Trump, he argued. How did you react to the new footage of the Capitol riot shown yesterday? Did it change your mind about whether Trump should be convicted or not? I'm catching the highlights of the trial. Trump should absolutely not be convicted. I'm not somebody who's just blinding myself to the facts. He didn't ask people to do anything violent. People showed up in advance planning violent acts, like the one person who planted some explosive devices the night before. Trump had nothing to do with that. There are obviously some bad elements that showed up intent on a violent protest long before Trump even spoke that day. I think Trump is a pretty smart guy who knows the effect his words have and I don't think he wanted the actual outcome of 6 January. David Schoen, left, and Bruce Castor, right, are leading the defence of former president Trump The next time we're back in the Senate chamber, we'll be hearing from Donald Trump's defence team. So who are they? Trump has two lawyers defending him during this trial:David Schoen, a trial lawyer from Alabama, andBruce Castor, a former district attorney. Schoen has previously represented Roger Stone, a former Trump adviser (who you may recall received a presidential pardon in December). Schoen also made headlines in the past  for meeting with Jeffrey 
Epstein in his final days to discuss possible representation, and for 
later saying he did not believe the death of the US financier and sex 
offender was suicide. Castor, a former Pennsylvania district attorney, is known for declining
 to prosecute Bill Cosby for sexual assault in 2005 - though Cosby was eventually convicted in a 2018 retrial. Read more about the key players in this impeachment trial here. Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri has been criticised for his demeanor during the impeachment trial: at one point, he sat with his feet up on a chair and watched the proceedings. Earlier, he was attacked for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results. Editorial writers at a Missouri newspaper have ripped into him for his actions, saying that he is an ""embarrassment"" to the state. He has alienated these editorial writers, and some ordinary voters too. Hawley's approval rating in the state dropped six points last month, according to a Morning Consult poll, from 42% to 36%. He seems unfazed, though, and has continued to hammer away at Democrats. On Thursday, Hawley told Fox News that the impeachment was a ""kangaroo trial"". He is likely to ramp up his arguments against the Democrats, as well as his aggressive language, if he decides to run for president in 2024, as many have predicted. Samantha GranvilleBBC News, Capitol Hill Senators have to be silent on the Senate floor, and though they havenât been very chatty outside, they are talking to the press. Most Republicans believe that there is no correlation between Trumpâs words and the actions of the insurrectionists. ""Today was not connecting the dots,â said Senator James Lanford. And Senator Jim Inhofe added: ""The more you hear it, the less credibility there is in it."" Senator Ted Cruz had some fiery words about the trial so far. ""If words like fight and win and take back our country now satisfy the legal standard for incitement, then every political candidate in the country...is about to be prosecuted."" Lawyers Bruce Castor and David Schoen will set out Trump's case Now that Democratic prosecutors have finished setting out
their case, itâs time for Donald Trumpâs lawyers to have their say. Attorneys Bruce Castor and David Schoen will have up to 16 hours over the
next two days to set out their defence, although they are not expected to use
all that time. On the opening day of the trial, they argued that Trump was
exercising his right to free speech, both in tweets and when he took to the
stage in front of supporters on 6 January. We are likely to hear more of this
line of argument from them. Earlier today, Schoen accused the Democrats of making ""movies"" and
presenting the case as an ""entertainment package"" with the video and audio
footage they showed the Senate. After Trumpâs team concludes their case, the Senate will have
up to four hours to ask written questions of both sides. Witnesses could also
be called but it is not yet clear if that will happen. If there are no witnesses, we could see a vote on conviction this weekend, or by Monday. As he concluded his argument, lead impeachment manager Jamie Raskin outlined some questions for Donald Trump's defence team. Donald Trump refused the chance to testify for himself, Raskin said, so Democrats pose these questions to his lawyers instead: And lastly, a legal question: Allow Twitter content?

That's a wrap on the opening arguments of the prosecution's case. Over the last three days, the House impeachment managers have argued that Trump incited the deadly siege at the US Capitol on 6 January. Now, the Senate has adjourned until tomorrow - when we'll hear from Trump's defence team. Congressman Jamie Raskin is closing his argument with direct appeals to the president's defence team. His message? A reminder that the question of whether the trial is allowed by law is over. ""We've put that jurisdictional, constitutional issue to bed,"" Raskin says. ""This is a trial on the facts of what happened and incitement is a fact-intensive investigation and a judgment each of you will have to make."" Joe Neguse has concluded summing up the evidence the prosecution has shared over the past two days. ""We humbly, humbly, ask you to convict,"" he says. ""Because if you donât... if we pretend this didnât happen, or worse if we let it go unanswered, whoâs to say it wonât happen again."" He turns the podium over to lead manager Jamie Raskin. Joe Neguse, the youngest member of the house impeachment team, is given the important job of recapping the evidence against Trump. A child of refugees from Eritrea, the 36-year-old is the first African-American congressman from the state of Colorado. He started making waves on social media yesterday when he presented a good portion of the evidence against the ex-president. Here's what people on Twitter are saying about him. Allow Twitter content?

Republicans in Congress are ""so tired"" after years of being led by Donald Trump that many just want to put this episode behind them, a former senior Republican Senate staff member says. Antonia Ferrier told the BBC's Ros Atkins that there were a variety of reasons why Republicans are unlikely to vote for Mr Trump's impeachment even though the Democrats have put together a ""very compelling"" case against him. ""There are some who think that continuing down this path ... just keeps emotions enflamed. They would rather take the temperature down and get back to work,"" she said. ""Many of them just want this chapter to be over, after four years of Donald Trump, they are just tired of the man."" You can watch more of Ms Ferrier's interview here: Allow Twitter content?

Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington In their brief, Trumpâs lawyers used a time-honoured defence: their client, they argued, was âmisunderstoodâ. They also spelled United States wrong calling it the âUnites Statesâ, another sign of a hastily-put together document. They are planning to wrap up their argument in one day, a surprisingly short time, given the enormity of the charge - and one less day than they were allotted. The Democrats have built a detailed case against the former president over two days, with their arguments supported by chilling video of the violent assault on the Capitol. In contrast, when we heard from the defence earlier this week one lawyer, Bruce Castor, rambled, and even seemed confused. Trump was reportedly furious. You canread more about the scathing reviews here. Later, Castor insisted on Fox News that his client did in fact approve of their work, despite what people were saying. It was hardly a strong message - but heâll have a second chance to impress on Friday. We've heard a lot of people speak about Donald Trump over the past few days, but the man himself has been out of sight. Banned from Twitter, Trump has not shared his thoughts about the trial or much of anything else in his post-presidency. Here's what we do know. The former president now lives in Florida and on Tuesday he received some good news whenthe Palm Beach city council voted to allow his permanent residency at his club, Mar-a-Lago. Earlier today, according to CNN, he was spotted by one of their network's photographer playing a round of golf at his West Palm Beach course. He has declined to testify in the ongoing impeachment trial in Washington DC, with his lawyers slamming it as ""a publicity stunt"". Their defence starts tomorrow, but Trump will not be present. It remains unclear how much of the trial he is watching. Jessica Watkins (centre) is facing trial for conspiracy over the 6 January riot An alleged leader
of a paramilitary group that stormed the Capitol spoke of waiting for direction
from President Trump, prosecutors have said in a court filing. Jessica Watkins was
among a number of so-called Oath Keepers who changed into military dress and
walked on the Capitol after listening to Donald Trumpâs speech on 6 January. She was later seen
on a self-shot video in the Capitol building, and heard saying via walkie-talkie: ""We have a good groupâ¦ Sticking together and sticking to the plan."" The 38-year-old army veteran from Ohio has been charged with conspiracy. Prosecutors said,
ina document supporting her detention and published by CNN,external, she had ""trained and plotted for a
moment like this"". The document also
referenced a message she wrote after the November election expressing her
concern about taking action without Trumpâs backing: ""The [president] has the right
to activate units too. If Trump asks me to come, I will. Otherwise, I canât
trust it."" Jessica Watkins is a former army veteran Democratic prosecutors of Trump's second impeachment trial accused him of inciting the 6 January riots on Capitol Hill with a barrage of incendiary speeches and tweets following his election loss. The former president's lawyers will argue on Friday that he was exercising freedom of speech by calling the election a fraud, and never directly told his supporters to enter the Capitol building. Read more about the Oath Keepers and other US militia groups here. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter The House impeachment managers have finished presenting their case over the course of about 13 hours. Donald Trumpâs defence team will now get its turn. His lawyers will have up to 16 hours over two days to offer a rebuttal, although theyâre already saying they plan to wrap up by Friday evening. They feel like theyâre winning â and, if listening to Republican senators is any indication, theyâre probably right. After Trumpâs side finishes, senators will have up to four hours to present written questions to the legal teams. That will be followed by a debate and vote over whether to allow witnesses - if either side wants them. If they donât, or if the vote fails, both sides will make brief closing arguments followed by the final vote on Trumpâs fate. All told, this could wrap up as early as Saturday night or by Monday at the latest â less than a week from start to finish. That stands in stark contrast to Trumpâs last trial, which took three weeks, or President Andrew Johnsonâs proceedings in 1868, which had witnesses and took more than two months. Most of the Senate seems ready to move on as soon as possible â and it looks like theyâll get their wish. Barbara Plett UsherBBC News, US Capitol Democrats argued today that one of the reasons Donald Trump should be impeached is because he has damaged Americaâs standing in the international community. They said insurrectionists incited by Trump showed how easy it was to penetrate an American government building and foreign adversaries were probably taking notes. They argued that his actions gave authoritarian governments ammunition to defend their policies. China, for example, could more easily condemn democracy activists in Hong Kong as insurrectionists, said Congressman Joaquin Castro on the Senate floor, and Iran is mocking us. The world is watching to see whether rule of law prevails over rule of the mob in the United States â thatâs what weâre showing the world if we convict Donald Trump, he argued. How did you react to the new footage of the Capitol riot shown yesterday? Did it change your mind about whether Trump should be convicted or not? I'm catching the highlights of the trial. Trump should absolutely not be convicted. I'm not somebody who's just blinding myself to the facts. He didn't ask people to do anything violent. People showed up in advance planning violent acts, like the one person who planted some explosive devices the night before. Trump had nothing to do with that. There are obviously some bad elements that showed up intent on a violent protest long before Trump even spoke that day. I think Trump is a pretty smart guy who knows the effect his words have and I don't think he wanted the actual outcome of 6 January. David Schoen, left, and Bruce Castor, right, are leading the defence of former president Trump The next time we're back in the Senate chamber, we'll be hearing from Donald Trump's defence team. So who are they? Trump has two lawyers defending him during this trial:David Schoen, a trial lawyer from Alabama, andBruce Castor, a former district attorney. Schoen has previously represented Roger Stone, a former Trump adviser (who you may recall received a presidential pardon in December). Schoen also made headlines in the past  for meeting with Jeffrey 
Epstein in his final days to discuss possible representation, and for 
later saying he did not believe the death of the US financier and sex 
offender was suicide. Castor, a former Pennsylvania district attorney, is known for declining
 to prosecute Bill Cosby for sexual assault in 2005 - though Cosby was eventually convicted in a 2018 retrial. Read more about the key players in this impeachment trial here. Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri has been criticised for his demeanor during the impeachment trial: at one point, he sat with his feet up on a chair and watched the proceedings. Earlier, he was attacked for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results. Editorial writers at a Missouri newspaper have ripped into him for his actions, saying that he is an ""embarrassment"" to the state. He has alienated these editorial writers, and some ordinary voters too. Hawley's approval rating in the state dropped six points last month, according to a Morning Consult poll, from 42% to 36%. He seems unfazed, though, and has continued to hammer away at Democrats. On Thursday, Hawley told Fox News that the impeachment was a ""kangaroo trial"". He is likely to ramp up his arguments against the Democrats, as well as his aggressive language, if he decides to run for president in 2024, as many have predicted. Samantha GranvilleBBC News, Capitol Hill Senators have to be silent on the Senate floor, and though they havenât been very chatty outside, they are talking to the press. Most Republicans believe that there is no correlation between Trumpâs words and the actions of the insurrectionists. ""Today was not connecting the dots,â said Senator James Lanford. And Senator Jim Inhofe added: ""The more you hear it, the less credibility there is in it."" Senator Ted Cruz had some fiery words about the trial so far. ""If words like fight and win and take back our country now satisfy the legal standard for incitement, then every political candidate in the country...is about to be prosecuted."" Lawyers Bruce Castor and David Schoen will set out Trump's case Now that Democratic prosecutors have finished setting out
their case, itâs time for Donald Trumpâs lawyers to have their say. Attorneys Bruce Castor and David Schoen will have up to 16 hours over the
next two days to set out their defence, although they are not expected to use
all that time. On the opening day of the trial, they argued that Trump was
exercising his right to free speech, both in tweets and when he took to the
stage in front of supporters on 6 January. We are likely to hear more of this
line of argument from them. Earlier today, Schoen accused the Democrats of making ""movies"" and
presenting the case as an ""entertainment package"" with the video and audio
footage they showed the Senate. After Trumpâs team concludes their case, the Senate will have
up to four hours to ask written questions of both sides. Witnesses could also
be called but it is not yet clear if that will happen. If there are no witnesses, we could see a vote on conviction this weekend, or by Monday. As he concluded his argument, lead impeachment manager Jamie Raskin outlined some questions for Donald Trump's defence team. Donald Trump refused the chance to testify for himself, Raskin said, so Democrats pose these questions to his lawyers instead: And lastly, a legal question: Allow Twitter content?

That's a wrap on the opening arguments of the prosecution's case. Over the last three days, the House impeachment managers have argued that Trump incited the deadly siege at the US Capitol on 6 January. Now, the Senate has adjourned until tomorrow - when we'll hear from Trump's defence team. Congressman Jamie Raskin is closing his argument with direct appeals to the president's defence team. His message? A reminder that the question of whether the trial is allowed by law is over. ""We've put that jurisdictional, constitutional issue to bed,"" Raskin says. ""This is a trial on the facts of what happened and incitement is a fact-intensive investigation and a judgment each of you will have to make."" Joe Neguse has concluded summing up the evidence the prosecution has shared over the past two days. ""We humbly, humbly, ask you to convict,"" he says. ""Because if you donât... if we pretend this didnât happen, or worse if we let it go unanswered, whoâs to say it wonât happen again."" He turns the podium over to lead manager Jamie Raskin. Joe Neguse, the youngest member of the house impeachment team, is given the important job of recapping the evidence against Trump. A child of refugees from Eritrea, the 36-year-old is the first African-American congressman from the state of Colorado. He started making waves on social media yesterday when he presented a good portion of the evidence against the ex-president. Here's what people on Twitter are saying about him. Allow Twitter content?

""There are some who think that continuing down this path ... just keeps emotions enflamed. They would rather take the temperature down and get back to work,"" she said.

"Democrats have concluded their case that Trump incited the 6 January Capitol riot The prosecutors used rioters' own words to tie the former president to violence at the Capitol On Wednesday the trial was shown new footage of the violence Trump is accused of inciting The deadly riot at the US Capitol was an attempt by Trump supporters to stop the election result being certified Trump's lawyers have argued he has freedom of speech to declare the election fraudulent Seventeen Republicans will need to turn against their former president to convict him Edited by Marianna Brady and Ritu Prasad Thanks for tuning into our live coverage of the impeachment trial. We're done for now, but we'll be back tomorrow at11:30 EST/16:30 GMTas the defence team begins their arguments. In the meantime, you can follow updates to the story here. Here are the key moments from today:  Today's
 editors and writers were: Marianna Brady, 
Tom Spender, Ritu Prasad, Sam Cabral, Holly Honderich and Penny Spiller. The trial may be heading into the weekend, but we'll still be here breaking it all down for you. But until proceedings pick back up again tomorrow, here's a selection of our best explainers and features to check out: For four years, Mike Pence was a loyal vice-president to Donald Trump. He smoothed the rough edges of the Trump presidency, and Trump's supporters loved him for it. But on 6 January, the pro-Trump mob at the Capitol branded him a traitor, even chanting ""hang Mike Pence"". So what changed? This video can not be played How Mike Pence became a villain in Trump world There is at least one more full day left in the Senate trial, but the final outcome is all but set. Despite some acknowledgement from Republicans that Democratic impeachment managers have made powerful arguments, there's no indication it has changed any minds. Republican senators are still insisting that the trial remains unconstitutional, since Trump is now a private citizen, and is therefore a waste of time.

"This video can not be played Citing the suffragettes, Stella Creasy calls for all MPs to be given parental leave and not just those serving as ministers. Labour's Stella Creasy is threatening legal action against the government after they did not include all MPs in maternity cover plans. The government has passed a new law so senior ministers do not have to resign if they have a baby. The move was prompted by Attorney General Suella Braverman, who is due to give birth next month. Ms Creasy, who is also pregnant, welcomed the change, but said it should not just apply to those at the top. Backbench MPs are allowed take informal maternity leave, but not all their duties are covered during their absence. The situation is different for ministers, who are not able to take time off from their positions. Law change to allow maternity leave for minister 'Locum MP' to cover Stella Creasy maternity Under the old system, they had to resign from their ministerial jobs if they want maternity leave, although they continued to receive their MPs' salary. But with the government's changes, Ms Braverman and other cabinet ministers are now able to take six months' leave on full ministerial pay, and the salary costs for a temporary replacement will be covered. In 2019, Stella Creasy became the first MP to be given locum maternity leave cover, after a battle with the parliamentary authorities, who, she says, had told her it was not possible under Commons rules. The government's decision to push theMinisterial and Other Maternity Allowances Bill,externalthrough Parliament in a single day shows that it is possible, the Walthamstow MP said. She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I think every woman should be able to have paid maternity cover, proper cover - it's not just about being paid, it's that somebody else will be doing that job - so Suella Braverman will be able to take proper leave with her child."" Attorney General Suella Braverman is due to give birth next month Ms Creasy, who is expecting her second child, said lawyers had advised her the changes were discriminatory as they only benefitted senior ministers, and not other members of Parliament. ""I am very prepared to go to court over this, because it is a form of direct discrimination... as a backbencher, none of these provisions will apply to myself, it's still very unclear what I can tell my constituents they can get in terms of cover,"" she told Today. ""Thousands of pregnant women are facing risks in the workplace, including the risk of the loss of their job. The message that we're sending is that we treat maternity leave like a benefit, like a company car."" Cabinet Office Minister Penny Mordaunt told MPs the bill to change maternity rights for senior ministers was an ""important and well overdue change"". She said alterations in the Ministerial Code in 2019 allowed for other members of the government to take over roles from a junior minister on maternity leave. The bill puts to an end the ""wholly unacceptable"" situation of senior ministers resigning to allow other government members to take over their departments while on maternity leave, she said in the Commons. Minister Penny Mordaunt said the law would make for an ""important and well overdue change"". Ms Braverman said she was grateful to Boris Johnson and the Conservatives for ""leading this historic change to support women in the workplace"". Labour did not oppose the changes in the Commons. Former Work and Pensions Secretary Yvette Cooper told MPs it had been 20 years since she was the first junior minister - then in the Department of Health - to take maternity leave. She warned the changes were ""limited"" as they did not have any provisions for male ministers to take longer paternity leave. Ms Cooper said that when she needed to take maternity leave two decades ago: ""I asked the health secretary what I should do, he didn't know, he said ask the prime minister, he didn't know, he said ask the cabinet secretary he said he had no idea.

"This video can not be played Citing the suffragettes, Stella Creasy calls for all MPs to be given parental leave and not just those serving as ministers. Labour's Stella Creasy is threatening legal action against the government after they did not include all MPs in maternity cover plans. The government has passed a new law so senior ministers do not have to resign if they have a baby. The move was prompted by Attorney General Suella Braverman, who is due to give birth next month. Ms Creasy, who is also pregnant, welcomed the change, but said it should not just apply to those at the top. Backbench MPs are allowed take informal maternity leave, but not all their duties are covered during their absence. The situation is different for ministers, who are not able to take time off from their positions. Law change to allow maternity leave for minister 'Locum MP' to cover Stella Creasy maternity Under the old system, they had to resign from their ministerial jobs if they want maternity leave, although they continued to receive their MPs' salary. But with the government's changes, Ms Braverman and other cabinet ministers are now able to take six months' leave on full ministerial pay, and the salary costs for a temporary replacement will be covered. In 2019, Stella Creasy became the first MP to be given locum maternity leave cover, after a battle with the parliamentary authorities, who, she says, had told her it was not possible under Commons rules. The government's decision to push theMinisterial and Other Maternity Allowances Bill,externalthrough Parliament in a single day shows that it is possible, the Walthamstow MP said. She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I think every woman should be able to have paid maternity cover, proper cover - it's not just about being paid, it's that somebody else will be doing that job - so Suella Braverman will be able to take proper leave with her child."" Attorney General Suella Braverman is due to give birth next month Ms Creasy, who is expecting her second child, said lawyers had advised her the changes were discriminatory as they only benefitted senior ministers, and not other members of Parliament. ""I am very prepared to go to court over this, because it is a form of direct discrimination... as a backbencher, none of these provisions will apply to myself, it's still very unclear what I can tell my constituents they can get in terms of cover,"" she told Today. ""Thousands of pregnant women are facing risks in the workplace, including the risk of the loss of their job. The message that we're sending is that we treat maternity leave like a benefit, like a company car."" Cabinet Office Minister Penny Mordaunt told MPs the bill to change maternity rights for senior ministers was an ""important and well overdue change"". She said alterations in the Ministerial Code in 2019 allowed for other members of the government to take over roles from a junior minister on maternity leave. The bill puts to an end the ""wholly unacceptable"" situation of senior ministers resigning to allow other government members to take over their departments while on maternity leave, she said in the Commons. Minister Penny Mordaunt said the law would make for an ""important and well overdue change"". Ms Braverman said she was grateful to Boris Johnson and the Conservatives for ""leading this historic change to support women in the workplace"". Labour did not oppose the changes in the Commons. Former Work and Pensions Secretary Yvette Cooper told MPs it had been 20 years since she was the first junior minister - then in the Department of Health - to take maternity leave. She warned the changes were ""limited"" as they did not have any provisions for male ministers to take longer paternity leave. Ms Cooper said that when she needed to take maternity leave two decades ago: ""I asked the health secretary what I should do, he didn't know, he said ask the prime minister, he didn't know, he said ask the cabinet secretary he said he had no idea. ""As ministers are Crown appointments, he said it was really a matter for the Queen, but nobody thought we should be asking Her Majesty."" The MP said they ""then tried to work something out"" that was similar to the arrangements for civil servants, but ""no one had thought about it before - that was bad enough 20 years ago"". She added: ""At the heart of government [these issues] still aren't being taken seriously enough.""

"Democrats have concluded their case that Trump incited the 6 January Capitol riot The prosecutors used rioters' own words to tie the former president to violence at the Capitol On Wednesday the trial was shown new footage of the violence Trump is accused of inciting The deadly riot at the US Capitol was an attempt by Trump supporters to stop the election result being certified Trump's lawyers have argued he has freedom of speech to declare the election fraudulent Seventeen Republicans will need to turn against their former president to convict him Edited by Marianna Brady and Ritu Prasad Thanks for tuning into our live coverage of the impeachment trial. We're done for now, but we'll be back tomorrow at11:30 EST/16:30 GMTas the defence team begins their arguments. In the meantime, you can follow updates to the story here. Here are the key moments from today:  Today's
 editors and writers were: Marianna Brady, 
Tom Spender, Ritu Prasad, Sam Cabral, Holly Honderich and Penny Spiller. The trial may be heading into the weekend, but we'll still be here breaking it all down for you. But until proceedings pick back up again tomorrow, here's a selection of our best explainers and features to check out: For four years, Mike Pence was a loyal vice-president to Donald Trump. He smoothed the rough edges of the Trump presidency, and Trump's supporters loved him for it. But on 6 January, the pro-Trump mob at the Capitol branded him a traitor, even chanting ""hang Mike Pence"". So what changed? This video can not be played How Mike Pence became a villain in Trump world There is at least one more full day left in the Senate trial, but the final outcome is all but set. Despite some acknowledgement from Republicans that Democratic impeachment managers have made powerful arguments, there's no indication it has changed any minds. Republican senators are still insisting that the trial remains unconstitutional, since Trump is now a private citizen, and is therefore a waste of time. Here is what some Republicans are saying today: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington In their brief, Trumpâs lawyers used a time-honoured defence: their client, they argued, was âmisunderstoodâ. They also spelled United States wrong calling it the âUnites Statesâ, another sign of a hastily-put together document. They are planning to wrap up their argument in one day, a surprisingly short time, given the enormity of the charge - and one less day than they were allotted. The Democrats have built a detailed case against the former president over two days, with their arguments supported by chilling video of the violent assault on the Capitol. In contrast, when we heard from the defence earlier this week one lawyer, Bruce Castor, rambled, and even seemed confused. Trump was reportedly furious. You canread more about the scathing reviews here. Later, Castor insisted on Fox News that his client did in fact approve of their work, despite what people were saying. It was hardly a strong message - but heâll have a second chance to impress on Friday. We've heard a lot of people speak about Donald Trump over the past few days, but the man himself has been out of sight. Banned from Twitter, Trump has not shared his thoughts about the trial or much of anything else in his post-presidency. Here's what we do know. The former president now lives in Florida and on Tuesday he received some good news whenthe Palm Beach city council voted to allow his permanent residency at his club, Mar-a-Lago. Earlier today, according to CNN, he was spotted by one of their network's photographer playing a round of golf at his West Palm Beach course. He has declined to testify in the ongoing impeachment trial in Washington DC, with his lawyers slamming it as ""a publicity stunt"". Their defence starts tomorrow, but Trump will not be present. It remains unclear how much of the trial he is watching. Jessica Watkins (centre) is facing trial for conspiracy over the 6 January riot An alleged leader
of a paramilitary group that stormed the Capitol spoke of waiting for direction
from President Trump, prosecutors have said in a court filing. Jessica Watkins was
among a number of so-called Oath Keepers who changed into military dress and
walked on the Capitol after listening to Donald Trumpâs speech on 6 January. She was later seen
on a self-shot video in the Capitol building, and heard saying via walkie-talkie: ""We have a good groupâ¦ Sticking together and sticking to the plan."" The 38-year-old army veteran from Ohio has been charged with conspiracy. Prosecutors said,
ina document supporting her detention and published by CNN,external, she had ""trained and plotted for a
moment like this"". The document also
referenced a message she wrote after the November election expressing her
concern about taking action without Trumpâs backing: ""The [president] has the right
to activate units too. If Trump asks me to come, I will. Otherwise, I canât
trust it."" Jessica Watkins is a former army veteran Democratic prosecutors of Trump's second impeachment trial accused him of inciting the 6 January riots on Capitol Hill with a barrage of incendiary speeches and tweets following his election loss. The former president's lawyers will argue on Friday that he was exercising freedom of speech by calling the election a fraud, and never directly told his supporters to enter the Capitol building. Read more about the Oath Keepers and other US militia groups here. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter The House impeachment managers have finished presenting their case over the course of about 13 hours. Donald Trumpâs defence team will now get its turn. His lawyers will have up to 16 hours over two days to offer a rebuttal, although theyâre already saying they plan to wrap up by Friday evening. They feel like theyâre winning â and, if listening to Republican senators is any indication, theyâre probably right. After Trumpâs side finishes, senators will have up to four hours to present written questions to the legal teams. That will be followed by a debate and vote over whether to allow witnesses - if either side wants them. If they donât, or if the vote fails, both sides will make brief closing arguments followed by the final vote on Trumpâs fate. All told, this could wrap up as early as Saturday night or by Monday at the latest â less than a week from start to finish. That stands in stark contrast to Trumpâs last trial, which took three weeks, or President Andrew Johnsonâs proceedings in 1868, which had witnesses and took more than two months. Most of the Senate seems ready to move on as soon as possible â and it looks like theyâll get their wish. Barbara Plett UsherBBC News, US Capitol Democrats argued today that one of the reasons Donald Trump should be impeached is because he has damaged Americaâs standing in the international community. They said insurrectionists incited by Trump showed how easy it was to penetrate an American government building and foreign adversaries were probably taking notes. They argued that his actions gave authoritarian governments ammunition to defend their policies. China, for example, could more easily condemn democracy activists in Hong Kong as insurrectionists, said Congressman Joaquin Castro on the Senate floor, and Iran is mocking us. The world is watching to see whether rule of law prevails over rule of the mob in the United States â thatâs what weâre showing the world if we convict Donald Trump, he argued. How did you react to the new footage of the Capitol riot shown yesterday? Did it change your mind about whether Trump should be convicted or not? I'm catching the highlights of the trial. Trump should absolutely not be convicted. I'm not somebody who's just blinding myself to the facts. He didn't ask people to do anything violent. People showed up in advance planning violent acts, like the one person who planted some explosive devices the night before. Trump had nothing to do with that. There are obviously some bad elements that showed up intent on a violent protest long before Trump even spoke that day. I think Trump is a pretty smart guy who knows the effect his words have and I don't think he wanted the actual outcome of 6 January. David Schoen, left, and Bruce Castor, right, are leading the defence of former president Trump The next time we're back in the Senate chamber, we'll be hearing from Donald Trump's defence team. So who are they? Trump has two lawyers defending him during this trial:David Schoen, a trial lawyer from Alabama, andBruce Castor, a former district attorney. Schoen has previously represented Roger Stone, a former Trump adviser (who you may recall received a presidential pardon in December). Schoen also made headlines in the past  for meeting with Jeffrey 
Epstein in his final days to discuss possible representation, and for 
later saying he did not believe the death of the US financier and sex 
offender was suicide. Castor, a former Pennsylvania district attorney, is known for declining
 to prosecute Bill Cosby for sexual assault in 2005 - though Cosby was eventually convicted in a 2018 retrial. Read more about the key players in this impeachment trial here. Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri has been criticised for his demeanor during the impeachment trial: at one point, he sat with his feet up on a chair and watched the proceedings. Earlier, he was attacked for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results. Editorial writers at a Missouri newspaper have ripped into him for his actions, saying that he is an ""embarrassment"" to the state. He has alienated these editorial writers, and some ordinary voters too. Hawley's approval rating in the state dropped six points last month, according to a Morning Consult poll, from 42% to 36%. He seems unfazed, though, and has continued to hammer away at Democrats. On Thursday, Hawley told Fox News that the impeachment was a ""kangaroo trial"". He is likely to ramp up his arguments against the Democrats, as well as his aggressive language, if he decides to run for president in 2024, as many have predicted. Samantha GranvilleBBC News, Capitol Hill Senators have to be silent on the Senate floor, and though they havenât been very chatty outside, they are talking to the press. Most Republicans believe that there is no correlation between Trumpâs words and the actions of the insurrectionists. ""Today was not connecting the dots,â said Senator James Lanford. And Senator Jim Inhofe added: ""The more you hear it, the less credibility there is in it."" Senator Ted Cruz had some fiery words about the trial so far. ""If words like fight and win and take back our country now satisfy the legal standard for incitement, then every political candidate in the country...is about to be prosecuted."" Lawyers Bruce Castor and David Schoen will set out Trump's case Now that Democratic prosecutors have finished setting out
their case, itâs time for Donald Trumpâs lawyers to have their say. Attorneys Bruce Castor and David Schoen will have up to 16 hours over the
next two days to set out their defence, although they are not expected to use
all that time. On the opening day of the trial, they argued that Trump was
exercising his right to free speech, both in tweets and when he took to the
stage in front of supporters on 6 January. We are likely to hear more of this
line of argument from them. Earlier today, Schoen accused the Democrats of making ""movies"" and
presenting the case as an ""entertainment package"" with the video and audio
footage they showed the Senate. After Trumpâs team concludes their case, the Senate will have
up to four hours to ask written questions of both sides. Witnesses could also
be called but it is not yet clear if that will happen. If there are no witnesses, we could see a vote on conviction this weekend, or by Monday. As he concluded his argument, lead impeachment manager Jamie Raskin outlined some questions for Donald Trump's defence team. Donald Trump refused the chance to testify for himself, Raskin said, so Democrats pose these questions to his lawyers instead: And lastly, a legal question: Allow Twitter content?

That's a wrap on the opening arguments of the prosecution's case. Over the last three days, the House impeachment managers have argued that Trump incited the deadly siege at the US Capitol on 6 January. Now, the Senate has adjourned until tomorrow - when we'll hear from Trump's defence team. Congressman Jamie Raskin is closing his argument with direct appeals to the president's defence team. His message? A reminder that the question of whether the trial is allowed by law is over. ""We've put that jurisdictional, constitutional issue to bed,"" Raskin says. ""This is a trial on the facts of what happened and incitement is a fact-intensive investigation and a judgment each of you will have to make."" Joe Neguse has concluded summing up the evidence the prosecution has shared over the past two days. ""We humbly, humbly, ask you to convict,"" he says. ""Because if you donât... if we pretend this didnât happen, or worse if we let it go unanswered, whoâs to say it wonât happen again."" He turns the podium over to lead manager Jamie Raskin. Joe Neguse, the youngest member of the house impeachment team, is given the important job of recapping the evidence against Trump. A child of refugees from Eritrea, the 36-year-old is the first African-American congressman from the state of Colorado. He started making waves on social media yesterday when he presented a good portion of the evidence against the ex-president. Here's what people on Twitter are saying about him. Allow Twitter content?

Republicans in Congress are ""so tired"" after years of being led by Donald Trump that many just want to put this episode behind them, a former senior Republican Senate staff member says. Antonia Ferrier told the BBC's Ros Atkins that there were a variety of reasons why Republicans are unlikely to vote for Mr Trump's impeachment even though the Democrats have put together a ""very compelling"" case against him. ""There are some who think that continuing down this path ... just keeps emotions enflamed. They would rather take the temperature down and get back to work,"" she said.

"University of Hull student Libby Squire was last seen in the early hours of 1 February 2019 A serial sex offender has been found guilty of raping and murdering a student before dumping her body in a river. Pawel Relowicz, 26, prowled the streets of Hull before attacking ""vulnerable"" 21-year-old Libby Squire. Jurors heard Relowicz had committed a string of offences against women prior to the killing. Speaking outside Sheffield Crown Court, Libby's mother paid tribute to her ""beautiful, caring, wonderful girl"". During the trial, prosecutor Richard Wright QC said Relowicz had spent the night of 31 January 2019 driving around looking for a woman to attack. The killer at the window Jurors heard University of Hull philosophy student Ms Squire, who had been turned away from a nightclub, was drunk and ""extremely vulnerable"" when Relowicz ""intercepted"" her . He drove her to Oak Road playing fields, where he attacked her before putting her in the River Hull. Prosecutors said the married father-of-two had repeatedly lied to police, his wife and in court documents about what happened on the night of Ms Squire's disappearance. Pawel Relowicz had previously committed a string of sexual offences against women He maintained he had consensual sex with the student and said he had lied because he did not want his wife to find out he had cheated on her. After a massive search effort, Ms Squire's remains were found in the Humber Estuary almost two months later. Her parents, Lisa and Russ, held hands and cried as they sat in the public gallery overlooking the courtroom to await the verdicts. Speaking outside court, Mrs Squire thanked supporters but said Relowicz's conviction ""changes nothing for us, there is no closure"". ""We don't get to have Libby back and our lives don't revert back to normal,"" she said. ""Libby will always be with us and we are all so proud of our beautiful, caring, wonderful girl.

He will be sentenced on Friday. Jurors found him guilty of rape unanimously and guilty of murder by a majority verdict of 11 to one. Pathologists were unable to establish how she died, or whether she was still alive when she went into the water. Witnessesreported hearing screamsfrom the playing fields on the night she disappeared. Gerry Wareham, from the Crown Prosecution Service said CCTV footage of Relowicz and Ms Squire's last known movements was ""crucial evidence"" in bringing the case to court. This video can not be played Footage of Libby Squire and Pawel Relowicz's movements was shown to jurors During the 14-day trial, the jury of seven women and five men heard Relowicz hadprevious convictions for voyeurism, performing sex acts in public and stealing sex toys and underwear from women's homes. One ofhis previous voyeurism victims told the BBCshe hoped the police would learn from the case. She said his earlier offences were ""sufficiently minor"" by themselves ""to not actually require the level of investigation that would result in him being caught"". In a statement, Humberside Police said it was ""satisfied"" with its investigation and that officers ""acted quickly"" to identify, locate and apprehend the defendant within days of Ms Squire's disappearance. Det Supt Martin Smalley said: ""I can understand that people are interested to know whether Libby's tragic death could have been prevented. ""It is important to remember that whilst, taken as a whole, and with the benefit of hindsight, we may be able to point to a history of offending by Pawel Relowicz, officers investigating these offences at the time were doing so with far less information than we have now and that my investigation into Libby's disappearance had."" Det Supt Smalley said the investigation was ""one of the most challenging and emotional cases"" in his 30-year career The University of Hull said it would continue to offer support to the student community. Vice-Chancellor Prof Susan Lea said in a statement: ""What took place in February 2019 deeply affected everyone at the university and those within the local community. ""Libby made a huge impact during her time at Hull, and will be remembered fondly by all who met her.""

"This video can not be played Citing the suffragettes, Stella Creasy calls for all MPs to be given parental leave and not just those serving as ministers. Labour's Stella Creasy is threatening legal action against the government after they did not include all MPs in maternity cover plans. The government has passed a new law so senior ministers do not have to resign if they have a baby. The move was prompted by Attorney General Suella Braverman, who is due to give birth next month. Ms Creasy, who is also pregnant, welcomed the change, but said it should not just apply to those at the top. Backbench MPs are allowed take informal maternity leave, but not all their duties are covered during their absence. The situation is different for ministers, who are not able to take time off from their positions. Law change to allow maternity leave for minister 'Locum MP' to cover Stella Creasy maternity Under the old system, they had to resign from their ministerial jobs if they want maternity leave, although they continued to receive their MPs' salary. But with the government's changes, Ms Braverman and other cabinet ministers are now able to take six months' leave on full ministerial pay, and the salary costs for a temporary replacement will be covered. In 2019, Stella Creasy became the first MP to be given locum maternity leave cover, after a battle with the parliamentary authorities, who, she says, had told her it was not possible under Commons rules. The government's decision to push theMinisterial and Other Maternity Allowances Bill,externalthrough Parliament in a single day shows that it is possible, the Walthamstow MP said. She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I think every woman should be able to have paid maternity cover, proper cover - it's not just about being paid, it's that somebody else will be doing that job - so Suella Braverman will be able to take proper leave with her child."" Attorney General Suella Braverman is due to give birth next month Ms Creasy, who is expecting her second child, said lawyers had advised her the changes were discriminatory as they only benefitted senior ministers, and not other members of Parliament. ""I am very prepared to go to court over this, because it is a form of direct discrimination... as a backbencher, none of these provisions will apply to myself, it's still very unclear what I can tell my constituents they can get in terms of cover,"" she told Today. ""Thousands of pregnant women are facing risks in the workplace, including the risk of the loss of their job. The message that we're sending is that we treat maternity leave like a benefit, like a company car."" Cabinet Office Minister Penny Mordaunt told MPs the bill to change maternity rights for senior ministers was an ""important and well overdue change"". She said alterations in the Ministerial Code in 2019 allowed for other members of the government to take over roles from a junior minister on maternity leave. The bill puts to an end the ""wholly unacceptable"" situation of senior ministers resigning to allow other government members to take over their departments while on maternity leave, she said in the Commons. Minister Penny Mordaunt said the law would make for an ""important and well overdue change"". Ms Braverman said she was grateful to Boris Johnson and the Conservatives for ""leading this historic change to support women in the workplace"". Labour did not oppose the changes in the Commons. Former Work and Pensions Secretary Yvette Cooper told MPs it had been 20 years since she was the first junior minister - then in the Department of Health - to take maternity leave. She warned the changes were ""limited"" as they did not have any provisions for male ministers to take longer paternity leave. Ms Cooper said that when she needed to take maternity leave two decades ago: ""I asked the health secretary what I should do, he didn't know, he said ask the prime minister, he didn't know, he said ask the cabinet secretary he said he had no idea. ""As ministers are Crown appointments, he said it was really a matter for the Queen, but nobody thought we should be asking Her Majesty."" The MP said they ""then tried to work something out"" that was similar to the arrangements for civil servants, but ""no one had thought about it before - that was bad enough 20 years ago"". She added: ""At the heart of government [these issues] still aren't being taken seriously enough."" Tracey Crouch took maternity leave in 2016 All MPs are paid in full while on maternity, paternity or adoption leave. But not all their duties in Parliament are covered during their absence: Conservative MP Tracey Crouch,externalwas the first Conservative minister to take maternity leave in 2016. She said she had been unsure about accepting the job of sports minister because she wanted to start family Chloe Smithinterrupted her maternity leave in 2017 to take part in a vote - becoming the first Conservative MP to bring their baby in to the Commons chamber In 2019, Labour MPTulip Siddiqwent against the advice of her doctors and delayed a planned caesarean section so she could take part in a crucial Brexit vote Labour'sStella Creasywas given permission to appoint a ""locum MP"" to cover her maternity leave in 2019 Father-of-three Conservative MPBim Afolami,externalwas the first dad able to vote by proxy when he took paternity leave Liberal Democrat MP Wendy Chamberlain said for female MPs, there were now provisions for locums to step in, but pointed out that was not yet available for male MPs on paternity leave. Some MPs had complaints about the language in the bill - which used the word ""persons"" instead of ""women"" - saying it was ""adopting extreme gender ideology"". But Ms Mordaunt said it had merely been a ""drafting issue"" and the term ""women"" would be used in all its documents going forward. Women are entitled to up to 52 weeks' maternity leave They must take at least two weeks' leave after the baby is born (or four weeks if they work in a factory) They are eligible to be paid for six weeks at 90% of their average weekly earnings and 33 weeks at Â£151 per week or 90% of their average weekly earnings (if lower) Fathers can take two weeks' statutory paternity leave at up to Â£151 a week Some couples are also entitled to shared parental leave of up to 50 weeks and 37 weeks of pay Some employers give contractual maternity pay as a benefit, what is paid varies, but is more than Statutory Maternity Pay Others are eligible for Maternity Allowance, paid by the government, this is usually for people who've been employed or self-employed for 26 weeks in the 66 weeks before their due date Creasy on parental leave: Time for deeds not words.

"Going abroad is not straightforward at the moment, so many people are choosing to holiday in the UK this summer. What are the current rules? You can travel freely between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, unlessyou have to self-isolatebecause you have Covid symptoms or have tested positive. All holiday accommodation - including hotels, hostels, B&B, caravans and boats - can operate across the UK. If you have to cancel a trip because of Covid, you may be entitled to a refund or to rearrange for a later date, but this will depend on the terms and conditions of your booking, so you will need to discuss this with your holiday provider. Anyone planning a trip to the Scottish islands is asked to take two lateral flow tests - one on the day of travel and one three days before. People travelling to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK are also advised to test before departure and after arrival, but this is not law. Some UK cruise operators are insisting passengers do a rapid test before boarding.SagaandP&Ohave said all cruise passengers must be fully vaccinated. How do I get my free Covid tests? How can I prove I'm fully vaccinated? There is no longer any requirement for social distancing, and no limits on how many people can stay together in holiday accommodation or private homes inEngland,ScotlandorWales. However people are still advised to meet others outdoors or in well-ventilated spaces wherever possible.

Wearing a face covering remains compulsory in many public indoor spaces inWales,Scotland, andNorthern Ireland, including on public transport, so you will be expected to use a mask on any cross-border plane, train or bus journey, unless you are exempt. Where do I still need to wear a mask? Museums, galleries, amusement parks, leisure centres, cinemas, theatres, stately homes and gardens can open across the UK. However, some venues are still not operating at full capacity, and you may need to pre-book tickets, so you should check before you visit. You may still be asked to wear a face covering or physically distance from other people. Businesses in Wales are required to carry out risk assessments to decide if social distancing measures are still needed.

"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have told the UK's tabloid press they are ending all co-operation with them.Â In a letter to editors of all the Sun, Mirror, Mail and Express titles and websites, a representative said the pair had taken the step due to ""distorted, false or invasive"" stories. Harry and Meghan said they refused to ""offer themselves up as currency for an economy of click bait and distortion"". The couple have relocated to California after stepping back as senior royals. In pictures: Harry and Meghan's life together Royal Family tree and line of succession How Meghan âtripped and fellâ into Harryâs life In the letter, the couple's public relations representative wrote it was ""gravely concerning that an influential slice of the media"" has printed ""distorted, false or invasive"" articles. ""There is a real human cost to this way of doing business and it affects every corner of society,"" the letter said. ""The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have watched people they know - as well as complete strangers - have their lives completely pulled apart for no good reason, other than the fact that salacious gossip boosts advertising revenue."" The BBC was told that the letter had been sent to the editors of the Sun, the Daily Mail, the Daily Mirror and the Daily Express newspapers. The new policy will apply to the four newspapers, their Sunday editions and associated websites,the Guardian's media editor Jim Waterson reported,external. The Daily Star, which was not specifically mentioned, is published by the same group that publishes the Mirror and Express titles. The ban on engagement with the papers will mean that the couple's PR team will no longer even answer calls from the papers asking them to confirm whether claims made about the couple are true or not. Outlining the new policy of ""no corroboration and zero engagement"" with all the publications that received it, the letter said the measure would also protect the couple's communications team ""from the side of the industry that readers never see"". ""This policy is not about avoiding criticism,"" the letter continued. ""It's not about shutting down public conversation or censoring accurate reporting. Media have every right to report on and indeed have an opinion on the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, good or bad. But it can't be based on a lie."" Prince Harry has spoken in the past of seeing - as a young child - the effect media intrusion had on his late mother, Diana, Princess of Wales The letter said the couple will continue to work with other media and ""young, up-and-coming journalists"" to raise awareness of the issues and causes they care about. Why the Royal Family rarely go to court Meghan's father 'would testify in privacy case' Meghan sues Mail on Sunday over private letter In recent days, photographs of the Sussexes delivering food to vulnerable people in Los Angeles have been published by two of the newspapers to receive the letter. And it comes ahead of a court hearing this week ina legal case Meghan has brought against the publisher of the Mail on Sundayover the publication of a letter written to the duchess by her estranged father. The couple officially stepped back as senior working members of the Royal Family at the end of March as part of a transition followingan announcement of their intention to become financially independent in January.. As The Duke and Duchess of Sussex now settle into the next chapter of their lives and no longer receive any publicly funded support, we are writing to set a new media relations policy, specifically as it pertains to your organisation. Like you, The Duke and Duchess of Sussex believe that a free press is a cornerstone to any democracyâ particularly in moments of crisis. At its best, this free press shines light on dark places, telling stories that would otherwise go untold, standing up for what's right, challenging power, and holding those who abuse the system to account. It has been said that journalism's first obligation is to the truth. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex agree wholeheartedly. It is gravely concerning that an influential slice of the media, over many years, has sought to insulate themselves from taking accountability for what they say or printâeven when they know it to be distorted, false, or invasive beyond reason. When power is enjoyed without responsibility, the trust we all place in this much-needed industry is degraded. There is a real human cost to this way of doing business and it affects every corner of society. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have watched people they knowâas well as complete strangersâhave their lives completely pulled apart for no good reason, other than the fact that salacious gossip boosts advertising revenue. With that said, please note that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will not be engaging with your outlet. There will be no corroboration and zero engagement. This is also a policy being instated for their communications team, in order to protect that team from the side of the industry that readers never see. This policy is not about avoiding criticism. It's not about shutting down public conversation or censoring accurate reporting. Media have every right to report on and indeed have an opinion on The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, good or bad. But it can't be based on a lie. They also want to be very clear: this is not in any way a blanket policy for all media. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are looking forward to working with journalists and media organisations all over the world, engaging with grassroots media, regional and local media, and young, up-and-coming journalists, to spotlight issues and causes that so desperately need acknowledging. And they look forward to doing whatever they can to help further opportunities for more diverse and underrepresented voices, who are needed now more than ever. What they won't do is offer themselves up as currency for an economy of click bait and distortion. We are encouraged that this new approach will be heard and respected.

Coronavirus prompted thousands of people to offer their services to help the NHS through the pandemic. And it inspired one mother and daughter to join nursing courses at the same university. Tracy Alexander, 49, chose to specialise in child nursing, while her daughter Sarah, 22, has pursued adult nursing - both at Liverpool John Moores University. They are both in their first year and began their studies in September. Sarah said it was ""nice to have someone who understands"" when she comes home after a day of lessons. This video can not be played Liverpool mum and daughter become nursing students together The closure of the hospitality sector during lockdown is having a knock-on effect on food producers. One - the Cornish Cheese Company - is warning that it has two tonnes of cheese at risk of being thrown away. Cornish Blue cheese takes about 10 weeks to mature and then has to be sold within six weeks. The firm usually sells 80% of its product to the hospitality sector and said the cheese would go off within two to three weeks. Ben Stansfield said: ""Normally we could sell this easily with all the wholesalers open, but it is all going to go off within two to three weeks. ""We are trying our best to not have to throw any away but we won't be able to sell it after that and you can't freeze two tonnes of cheese."" Find out morehere. A mother who suffocated her disabled son is said to have reached her ""wits' end"" during lockdown last year. Dylan Freeman's body was found in Acton, west London, on 16 August. His mother Olga Freemanpleaded guilty at the Old Bailey to manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibilityand has been detained in hospital indefinitely. The judge said Dylan was ""an indirect victim of interruption to normal life caused by the Covid-19 pandemic."" Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb said it was a""rare and desperately sad"" case. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent Simon Ashley and his twin boys - Ralph and Henry With twin boys approaching the age of two, Simon Ashley and his wife Katie realised they needed more space at home and decided to take advantage of the stamp duty holiday to move to a bigger property. But, along with many thousands of people also planning to move during the pandemic, theynow face a race to beat the deadline at the end of March. ""The stamp duty holiday is a big thing for us. To put it bluntly, the impact is just over Â£12,000,"" said Simon, aged 34. ""It is making us nervous."" The tax concession in England and Northern Ireland means no stamp duty is paid on the first Â£500,000 of a property sale. In Scotland and Wales the equivalent levies have had breaks too but all are set to return to their pre-pandemic thresholds on 1 April. More than five million people have fallen into a ""fragile"" financial position owing to the coronavirus crisis, with young working adults among the hardest hit, the Financial Conduct Authority warns. ItsFinancial Lives survey,externalis a benchmark for the state of the nation's finance and it says people from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds were also more seriously affected than others. The regulator says ""the pain is not being shared equally"". It warns an estimated 14.2 million people are vulnerable to afinancial shock. Stormont ministers will take a ""collective approach"" when reviewing Northern Ireland's lockdown restrictions next week, finance minister Conor Murphy has said. NI re-entered lockdown on 26 December, with the measures due to last until 5 March. But ministers will meet on Thursday to review what should happen beyond that point. First Minister Arlene Foster said there needed to be one more ""push"" to reduce infection rates as much as possible. She said next Thursday's executive meeting would be a ""key decision point"" about how Northern Ireland emerges from lockdown. A pathway to recovery document is due to be published by the executive in the coming weeks, with many businesses asking for clarity around indicative reopening dates. Read more Sweden has been rolling out vaccines since December Coronavirus deaths appear to be declining in Sweden as more elderly people receive vaccinations against the disease, health officials say. Another 44 Covid-19 deaths were registered on Thursday, bringing the total to 12,370 in Sweden. But deaths have been steadily declining since December, when more than 100 a day were being recorded, World Health Organization data showed. âWe can in good conscience say that this type of decrease should be due to the vaccines,â chief epidemiologist Anders Tegnell said, adding: âIt also follows what we have seen in Israel and other countries.â Sweden has prioritised vaccinating people in nursing homes, where many of the countryâs deaths have occurred. The coronavirus death rate in Sweden is higher than that of its Nordic neighbours, but lower than some European countries that imposed tight restrictions. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The latest daily Covid figures for the UK show continued progress, with just under 13,500 new infections reported. It means week on week there has been a drop of approaching a third â and this compares to an average of nearly 60,000 infections a day at the start of the year. The number of new deaths confirmed is 678. Daily figures do jump around a little but the average for the past week is now well below 800 a day, compared with more than 1,200 a few weeks ago. Could vaccination be playing a role? At the moment, there is nothing to clearly suggest it is â or at least not in a significant way. The drop seems to be largely driven by lockdown. But in the coming weeks expect that to change. The falls â at least in terms of hospital cases and deaths â could soon become even more marked. Vitaliy ShevchenkoBBC Monitoring In a rare update on the progress of Russia's vaccination
campaign, an official has said that more than 1.7 million Russians have been
fully vaccinated against coronavirus. Denis
Logunov from the state-run Gamaleya Centre, which developed Russia's Sputnik V
vaccine, was speaking at a meeting organised by the ruling United Russia party
at the Moscow City Council. He said some 2.2 million residents of the country
had received the first of two jabs. Officials
have so far been tight-lipped about the exact number of Russians who have been
vaccinated, and Logunovâs data suggests that Russia is lagging far
behind in the race to vaccinate against Covid-19. According to figures,external, fewer than 1.5% of the population in Russia have
received anti-coronavirus shots, compared to 69.5% in Israel, 47.4% in the UAE,
20% in the UK, 13.4% in the US, 5.6% in Chile and 2.8% in China. The daily figures also show a total of 13,509,108 people have now received the first dose of a vaccine in the UK - a rise of 450,810 compared with yesterday. The data wastweeted,externalby Public Health England, rather than published on the government's coronavirus dashboard as it normally is. PHE said due to a technical difficulty, the dashboard was expected to be updated at 18:00 GMT. A further 678 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, according to the latest government figures, which weretweeted by Public Health England,external. It takes the death toll by that measure to 115,529. There were also a further 13,494 cases reported. On Wednesday, 1,001 deaths and 13,013 cases were reported.   Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor In normal times, you probably wouldn't think it's any business of a politician's to tell you when, or when not, to book a summer holiday. The pandemic, of course, has changed all that - you can look still, but you may well not want to book. Health Secretary Matt Hancockhas said it's ""too early"" to knowwhether summer holidays can go ahead. His comments came after both the PM and Grant Shapps pleaded with people not to ""go ahead and book holidays"". Ministers' remarks clash with each other - in emphasis or fact sometimes - because they just do not know exactly what the situation will be, so they have no solid decision to explain. And if they don't know, well there's not much they can tell us. Read more from Laura's bloghere.  Prisoners in England's jails have been locked in their cells for more than 90% of the day to keep them safe from Covid-19, the prisons watchdog says. And the extra restrictions, which began in March, have led to a decline in their mental and physical health and a rise in drug taking and self-harm. ""It's being imprisoned while you're in prison,"" one inmate told inspectors. Predictions up to 2,000 inmates would die in the pandemic in England and Wales without action have been avoided. But inspectors who visited a cross-section of jails, interviewing male and female prisoners as well as young offenders, found the long-term consequences of such an extended and restrictive regime could be ""profound"", with some newly-released offenders ill-prepared for life outside. Normally, adult prisoners should spend between eight and 10 hours a day outside their cells. Meanwhile, at HMP Bullingdon in Oxfordshire a 52-year-old inmate hasdied following an outbreak of the virus. Read more  Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst The clock has struck midnight (16:00 GMT) in China, ushering in the Lunar New Year. It is normally the happiest time of the year in China, when families gather to have meals and set off fireworks. But because of coronavirus outbreaks in the country's north-east, many people will be celebrating alone this year. A âunique but safeâ new year is how some state media outlets have been framing the occasion. On the bright side, it has been four days since China recorded a domestically transmitted case of the coronavirus. So, with China's vaccination programme well under way, there is a lot of optimism for the Year of the Ox. As for the Year of the Rat, state media outlets appear to be pleased to see the back of it. On its Weibo account, the Peopleâs Daily newspaper posted a cartoon of an ox chasing a rat carrying parcels, and a coronavirus, out of an apartment. Meanwhile, in a reminder of more normal times, the annual New Year countdown show - the Spring Festival gala - returned to being the large-scale spectacle audiences expect it to be. Celebrations - more scaled down than usual - were seen across China to mark to Lunar New Year We've been hearing today about how England'squarantine hotel launch has been going- its booking website was taken offline just after launch. The quarantine measure is one of a growing number aimed at stopping the spread of new, potentially more-resistant Covid strains from other countries. From Monday, UK residents and Irish nationals who have been in33 red-list countries,externalin the 10 days before travelling will have to quarantine in hotelsselected by the government,external- at a cost of Â£1,750. They can only enter the UK at five airports: Heathrow, Gatwick, London City, Birmingham and Farnborough Airfield. Despite all this, UK travel providers say they are stillseeing strong demand for summer getaways later in the year. There is more on UK travel ruleshere. Germany has banned arrivals from countries with outbreaks of highly transmissible coronavirus variants The German government will impose a ban on travel from the Czech Republic and the Austrian region of Tyrol, Interior Minister Horst Seehofer has told local media. ""The states of Bavaria and Saxony today asked the government to class Tyrol and the border regions of the Czech Republic as virus mutation areas, and to implement border controls,"" Seehofer told the SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung newspaper on Thursday. He said the border controls, which have been approved by Chancellor Angela Merkel, will come into force on Sunday. Germany in late January banned most travellers from countries with the highest numbers of new, more contagious coronavirus variants. Only a handful of exceptions are allowed to enter Germany from these countries, including returning nationals and essential workers. The UK, where a highly contagious variant of the virus was first detected last year, is subject to such a travel ban. There are fears that vaccines are not as effective against some coronavirus variants, such as the one found in South Africa. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent For most government announcements, a day here or there might not make much difference. But nobody wants to wait any longer than necessary for the promised ""roadmap"" to take England out of lockdown. So when the prime minister promised that ""on 22 February"" he would reveal that plan, Conservative MPs were among those marking their diaries. But now Downing Street has said the roadmap will come ""on the week of the 22nd"". In response Tory backbenchers are warning the government not to ""backslide"" on its promise. They want to hold ministers to their aim of giving schools two weeks' notice before re-opening to all pupils on 8 March. A vocal minority of Conservative MPs have argued the current lockdown is too strict and needs to lift as soon as possible. Others have been more patient, but the further cases fall, the more people get the vaccine and the longer time goes on, the more pressure on the government will grow. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Thursday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning. The number of peoplewaiting more than 12 monthsto start hospital treatment in England was 224,205 in December, NHS figures show. It's the highest for any calendar month since April 2008, and compares with 1,467 in December 2019. It comes as growing numbers of operations were postponed during December when Covid cases rose rapidly. Professor Stephen Powis, national medical director for NHS England, said the health service ""remains under significant pressure"" and staff had worked extremely hard to provide essential services during the pandemic. A drug normally used to treat arthritiscan be a life-saver for some of the sickest hospital patientswith Covid, according to new research. For every 25 patients treated with tocilizumab, along with a cheap steroid already routinely given, an additional life would be saved, experts have said. Some hospitals are now doing this. As well as improving survival and recovery time, it can avoid patients needing to be moved to intensive care, said NHS doctors. A clinical trial with more than 4,000 volunteers was carried out and researchers say the results are a ""tremendous step forwards"". More than one million people have had their first dose of the Covid jab in Scotland so far. But Nicola Sturgeon has warned that the country's vaccination programmeis likely to slow down later this monthbecause of supply problems. The first minister said a ""temporary reduction"" in Pfizer's manufacturing capacity meant the country had received slightly lower stocks of the vaccine than expected. This means the number of vaccination appointments is likely to be reduced. But Ms Sturgeon insisted Scotland is still on track to hit its targets. This video can not be played Covid: Vaccine supplies could see roll-out 'slowdown' It wasn't a great start for travellers wanting to book their rooms in hotels being used as part of the UK's quarantine scheme. The new system forsecuring a place was taken offlineminutes after it launched. The portal, set up as part of efforts to control new Covid variants entering the UK, was removed temporarily for maintenance ""to correct a minor technical error"". It said rooms were available ""and travellers will be able to book through the site imminently"". From Monday, British and Irish citizens, and UK residents arriving in England from 33 ""red-list"" countries must isolate for 10 days in hotels, at a cost of Â£1,750 for one adult. A mother and daughter have joined nursing courses at the same university after they both decided they wanted to help on the front line as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Tracy Alexander, 49, chose to specialise in child nursing, while her daughter Sarah, 22, has pursued adult nursing at Liverpool John Moores University. They are both in their first year and began their studies in September. Sarah said it was ""nice to have someone who understands"" when she comes home after a day of lessons.

"This video can not be played Health Secretary Matt Hancock: 'We need to build a better, stronger NHS' The NHS in England is to be reformed so health and care services can work more closely together, the government says. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the planned restructure will mean a focus ""on the health of the population, not just the health of patients"". But Labour questioned the timing of the changes ""in the middle of the biggest public health crisis our NHS has ever faced"", saying staff were exhausted. Mr Hancock said there was ""no better time than now"". Afull White Paper,externalwas published on Thursday, setting out the proposed future legislation. ""The pandemic has made the changes in this White Paper more not less urgent,"" Mr Hancock told MPs. Year-long hospital waits for 225,000 in England Reforms planned for NHS in England Social care reform needed within a year - NHS boss The shake-up will see the law changed to reverse reforms of the NHS in England introduced under Prime Minister David Cameron in 2012. Ministers believe the changes will put the NHS in a better position to cope with an ageing population and a rise in people with complex health conditions. One-in-three patients admitted to hospital as an emergency has five or more health conditions, such as diabetes, obesity or asthma, up from one-in-10 a decade ago. Those working in the health service said many of the rules in place were time-consuming, frustrating and stressful. Announcing the changes to MPs, Mr Hancock said the new system would see the NHS and local councils take decisions about local health together. ""The new approach is based on the concept of population health,"" he said. Organisations called ""integrated care systems"" - which already exist in some parts of the country - will be set up in each part of England and be responsible for funding to support that area's health. ""They will provide not just for the treatments that are needed but support people to stay healthy in the first place,"" said Mr Hancock. Responding to criticism over the timing, Mr Hancock said the pandemic had ""brought home the importance of preventing ill health in the first place"". Nigel Edwards, of the Nuffield Trust think tank, said the changes would be a ""re-wiring behind the dashboard"" and should not be too noticeable to patients. While it was not a ""magic bullet"", it could help different parts of the system work more closely together, he added. The public will be rightly asking what difference these reforms make and why they are being introduced now in the middle of a pandemic. The concept predates Covid - councils and the NHS have been piloting these approaches to integrated care over the past few years. But, in many ways, the pandemic has speeded up the process. With more care being done out of hospital because of the pressures from Covid, community NHS and council care teams have been working ever more closely. There is much to recommend greater joined up working. The 21st century patient has multiple conditions. Take a 70-year-old with heart problem and dementia who lives alone. They will need input from a heart specialist, support from community nurses and maybe the company of a befriending service. The staff needed could come from three different organisations working and funded separately.  It creates bureaucracy and it is not hard to see how the quality of care suffers. The white paper is an attempt to re-wire the NHS. But those working for the NHS argue that is just one part of the solution - staffing and investment will also play a role. The proposals include scrapping the tendering rule, which sees providers and private companies compete to win contracts to run services. This rule made it complicated for councils and different parts of the NHS to set up joint teams and pool their budgets, with some having to set up separate bodies to bid for contracts. Instead, the NHS and councils will be left to run services and told to collaborate with each other to pool resources. It also gives the health secretary more control over NHS England and other national bodies, which had been given a large degree of autonomy under the 2012 changes. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said Labour had long argued for more integrated care, but raised questions over the timing. He also said the test of the reorganisation ""will be whether it brings waiting lists and times down, widens access especially for mental healthcare, drives up cancer survival rates and improves population health"". Mr Ashworth added that ""legislation alone of course is not the answer to integration. ""We need a long-term funded workforce plan. We've not got one. We need a sustainable social care plan. We were promised one on the steps of Downing Street. We still don't have one."" The UK's social care systemis under pressurewith past governments failing to reform or fund the council-run system properly. In their 2019 election manifesto, the Conservatives pledged to find a cross-party solution to reduce pressures on the sector and provide long-term funding. Mr Hancock told MPs the government was ""committed to the reform of adult social care and will bring forward proposals this year"". 11 charts on what's happened to the NHS Meanwhile, NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens said the reform will create a ""flexible can-do spirit"" across the health and care system. The White Paper will cite examples of good practice, such as a care team at the Royal Derby Hospital which sees nurses from the community, council care services and hospital staff working together to plan the discharge of patients. Chris Hopson, of NHS Providers, which represents NHS managers, said it would end ""an unnecessarily rigid NHS approach to procurement"". The Local Government Association welcomed the plans but said they did not provide the funding to put care services on a ""sustainable and long-term footing"".

"Democrats have concluded their case that Trump incited the 6 January Capitol riot The prosecutors used rioters' own words to tie the former president to violence at the Capitol On Wednesday the trial was shown new footage of the violence Trump is accused of inciting The deadly riot at the US Capitol was an attempt by Trump supporters to stop the election result being certified Trump's lawyers have argued he has freedom of speech to declare the election fraudulent Seventeen Republicans will need to turn against their former president to convict him Edited by Marianna Brady and Ritu Prasad Thanks for tuning into our live coverage of the impeachment trial.

This video can not be played How Mike Pence became a villain in Trump world There is at least one more full day left in the Senate trial, but the final outcome is all but set. Despite some acknowledgement from Republicans that Democratic impeachment managers have made powerful arguments, there's no indication it has changed any minds. Republican senators are still insisting that the trial remains unconstitutional, since Trump is now a private citizen, and is therefore a waste of time.

Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington In their brief, Trumpâs lawyers used a time-honoured defence: their client, they argued, was âmisunderstoodâ. They also spelled United States wrong calling it the âUnites Statesâ, another sign of a hastily-put together document. They are planning to wrap up their argument in one day, a surprisingly short time, given the enormity of the charge - and one less day than they were allotted. The Democrats have built a detailed case against the former president over two days, with their arguments supported by chilling video of the violent assault on the Capitol. In contrast, when we heard from the defence earlier this week one lawyer, Bruce Castor, rambled, and even seemed confused. Trump was reportedly furious. You canread more about the scathing reviews here. Later, Castor insisted on Fox News that his client did in fact approve of their work, despite what people were saying. It was hardly a strong message - but heâll have a second chance to impress on Friday. We've heard a lot of people speak about Donald Trump over the past few days, but the man himself has been out of sight. Banned from Twitter, Trump has not shared his thoughts about the trial or much of anything else in his post-presidency. Here's what we do know. The former president now lives in Florida and on Tuesday he received some good news whenthe Palm Beach city council voted to allow his permanent residency at his club, Mar-a-Lago. Earlier today, according to CNN, he was spotted by one of their network's photographer playing a round of golf at his West Palm Beach course. He has declined to testify in the ongoing impeachment trial in Washington DC, with his lawyers slamming it as ""a publicity stunt"". Their defence starts tomorrow, but Trump will not be present. It remains unclear how much of the trial he is watching. Jessica Watkins (centre) is facing trial for conspiracy over the 6 January riot An alleged leader
of a paramilitary group that stormed the Capitol spoke of waiting for direction
from President Trump, prosecutors have said in a court filing. Jessica Watkins was
among a number of so-called Oath Keepers who changed into military dress and
walked on the Capitol after listening to Donald Trumpâs speech on 6 January. She was later seen
on a self-shot video in the Capitol building, and heard saying via walkie-talkie: ""We have a good groupâ¦ Sticking together and sticking to the plan."" The 38-year-old army veteran from Ohio has been charged with conspiracy. Prosecutors said,
ina document supporting her detention and published by CNN,external, she had ""trained and plotted for a
moment like this"". The document also
referenced a message she wrote after the November election expressing her
concern about taking action without Trumpâs backing: ""The [president] has the right
to activate units too. If Trump asks me to come, I will. Otherwise, I canât
trust it."" Jessica Watkins is a former army veteran Democratic prosecutors of Trump's second impeachment trial accused him of inciting the 6 January riots on Capitol Hill with a barrage of incendiary speeches and tweets following his election loss. The former president's lawyers will argue on Friday that he was exercising freedom of speech by calling the election a fraud, and never directly told his supporters to enter the Capitol building. Read more about the Oath Keepers and other US militia groups here. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter The House impeachment managers have finished presenting their case over the course of about 13 hours. Donald Trumpâs defence team will now get its turn. His lawyers will have up to 16 hours over two days to offer a rebuttal, although theyâre already saying they plan to wrap up by Friday evening. They feel like theyâre winning â and, if listening to Republican senators is any indication, theyâre probably right. After Trumpâs side finishes, senators will have up to four hours to present written questions to the legal teams. That will be followed by a debate and vote over whether to allow witnesses - if either side wants them. If they donât, or if the vote fails, both sides will make brief closing arguments followed by the final vote on Trumpâs fate. All told, this could wrap up as early as Saturday night or by Monday at the latest â less than a week from start to finish. That stands in stark contrast to Trumpâs last trial, which took three weeks, or President Andrew Johnsonâs proceedings in 1868, which had witnesses and took more than two months. Most of the Senate seems ready to move on as soon as possible â and it looks like theyâll get their wish. Barbara Plett UsherBBC News, US Capitol Democrats argued today that one of the reasons Donald Trump should be impeached is because he has damaged Americaâs standing in the international community. They said insurrectionists incited by Trump showed how easy it was to penetrate an American government building and foreign adversaries were probably taking notes. They argued that his actions gave authoritarian governments ammunition to defend their policies. China, for example, could more easily condemn democracy activists in Hong Kong as insurrectionists, said Congressman Joaquin Castro on the Senate floor, and Iran is mocking us. The world is watching to see whether rule of law prevails over rule of the mob in the United States â thatâs what weâre showing the world if we convict Donald Trump, he argued. How did you react to the new footage of the Capitol riot shown yesterday? Did it change your mind about whether Trump should be convicted or not? I'm catching the highlights of the trial. Trump should absolutely not be convicted. I'm not somebody who's just blinding myself to the facts. He didn't ask people to do anything violent. People showed up in advance planning violent acts, like the one person who planted some explosive devices the night before. Trump had nothing to do with that. There are obviously some bad elements that showed up intent on a violent protest long before Trump even spoke that day. I think Trump is a pretty smart guy who knows the effect his words have and I don't think he wanted the actual outcome of 6 January. David Schoen, left, and Bruce Castor, right, are leading the defence of former president Trump The next time we're back in the Senate chamber, we'll be hearing from Donald Trump's defence team. So who are they? Trump has two lawyers defending him during this trial:David Schoen, a trial lawyer from Alabama, andBruce Castor, a former district attorney. Schoen has previously represented Roger Stone, a former Trump adviser (who you may recall received a presidential pardon in December). Schoen also made headlines in the past  for meeting with Jeffrey 
Epstein in his final days to discuss possible representation, and for 
later saying he did not believe the death of the US financier and sex 
offender was suicide. Castor, a former Pennsylvania district attorney, is known for declining
 to prosecute Bill Cosby for sexual assault in 2005 - though Cosby was eventually convicted in a 2018 retrial. Read more about the key players in this impeachment trial here. Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri has been criticised for his demeanor during the impeachment trial: at one point, he sat with his feet up on a chair and watched the proceedings. Earlier, he was attacked for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results. Editorial writers at a Missouri newspaper have ripped into him for his actions, saying that he is an ""embarrassment"" to the state. He has alienated these editorial writers, and some ordinary voters too. Hawley's approval rating in the state dropped six points last month, according to a Morning Consult poll, from 42% to 36%. He seems unfazed, though, and has continued to hammer away at Democrats. On Thursday, Hawley told Fox News that the impeachment was a ""kangaroo trial"". He is likely to ramp up his arguments against the Democrats, as well as his aggressive language, if he decides to run for president in 2024, as many have predicted. Samantha GranvilleBBC News, Capitol Hill Senators have to be silent on the Senate floor, and though they havenât been very chatty outside, they are talking to the press. Most Republicans believe that there is no correlation between Trumpâs words and the actions of the insurrectionists. ""Today was not connecting the dots,â said Senator James Lanford. And Senator Jim Inhofe added: ""The more you hear it, the less credibility there is in it."" Senator Ted Cruz had some fiery words about the trial so far. ""If words like fight and win and take back our country now satisfy the legal standard for incitement, then every political candidate in the country...is about to be prosecuted."" Lawyers Bruce Castor and David Schoen will set out Trump's case Now that Democratic prosecutors have finished setting out
their case, itâs time for Donald Trumpâs lawyers to have their say. Attorneys Bruce Castor and David Schoen will have up to 16 hours over the
next two days to set out their defence, although they are not expected to use
all that time. On the opening day of the trial, they argued that Trump was
exercising his right to free speech, both in tweets and when he took to the
stage in front of supporters on 6 January. We are likely to hear more of this
line of argument from them. Earlier today, Schoen accused the Democrats of making ""movies"" and
presenting the case as an ""entertainment package"" with the video and audio
footage they showed the Senate. After Trumpâs team concludes their case, the Senate will have
up to four hours to ask written questions of both sides. Witnesses could also
be called but it is not yet clear if that will happen. If there are no witnesses, we could see a vote on conviction this weekend, or by Monday. As he concluded his argument, lead impeachment manager Jamie Raskin outlined some questions for Donald Trump's defence team. Donald Trump refused the chance to testify for himself, Raskin said, so Democrats pose these questions to his lawyers instead: And lastly, a legal question: Allow Twitter content?

That's a wrap on the opening arguments of the prosecution's case. Over the last three days, the House impeachment managers have argued that Trump incited the deadly siege at the US Capitol on 6 January. Now, the Senate has adjourned until tomorrow - when we'll hear from Trump's defence team. Congressman Jamie Raskin is closing his argument with direct appeals to the president's defence team. His message? A reminder that the question of whether the trial is allowed by law is over. ""We've put that jurisdictional, constitutional issue to bed,"" Raskin says. ""This is a trial on the facts of what happened and incitement is a fact-intensive investigation and a judgment each of you will have to make."" Joe Neguse has concluded summing up the evidence the prosecution has shared over the past two days. ""We humbly, humbly, ask you to convict,"" he says. ""Because if you donât... if we pretend this didnât happen, or worse if we let it go unanswered, whoâs to say it wonât happen again."" He turns the podium over to lead manager Jamie Raskin. Joe Neguse, the youngest member of the house impeachment team, is given the important job of recapping the evidence against Trump. A child of refugees from Eritrea, the 36-year-old is the first African-American congressman from the state of Colorado. He started making waves on social media yesterday when he presented a good portion of the evidence against the ex-president. Here's what people on Twitter are saying about him. Allow Twitter content?

Republicans in Congress are ""so tired"" after years of being led by Donald Trump that many just want to put this episode behind them, a former senior Republican Senate staff member says. Antonia Ferrier told the BBC's Ros Atkins that there were a variety of reasons why Republicans are unlikely to vote for Mr Trump's impeachment even though the Democrats have put together a ""very compelling"" case against him. ""There are some who think that continuing down this path ... just keeps emotions enflamed. They would rather take the temperature down and get back to work,"" she said.

Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington In their brief, Trumpâs lawyers used a time-honoured defence: their client, they argued, was âmisunderstoodâ. They also spelled United States wrong calling it the âUnites Statesâ, another sign of a hastily-put together document. They are planning to wrap up their argument in one day, a surprisingly short time, given the enormity of the charge - and one less day than they were allotted. The Democrats have built a detailed case against the former president over two days, with their arguments supported by chilling video of the violent assault on the Capitol. In contrast, when we heard from the defence earlier this week one lawyer, Bruce Castor, rambled, and even seemed confused. Trump was reportedly furious. You canread more about the scathing reviews here. Later, Castor insisted on Fox News that his client did in fact approve of their work, despite what people were saying. It was hardly a strong message - but heâll have a second chance to impress on Friday. We've heard a lot of people speak about Donald Trump over the past few days, but the man himself has been out of sight. Banned from Twitter, Trump has not shared his thoughts about the trial or much of anything else in his post-presidency. Here's what we do know. The former president now lives in Florida and on Tuesday he received some good news whenthe Palm Beach city council voted to allow his permanent residency at his club, Mar-a-Lago. Earlier today, according to CNN, he was spotted by one of their network's photographer playing a round of golf at his West Palm Beach course. He has declined to testify in the ongoing impeachment trial in Washington DC, with his lawyers slamming it as ""a publicity stunt"". Their defence starts tomorrow, but Trump will not be present. It remains unclear how much of the trial he is watching. Jessica Watkins (centre) is facing trial for conspiracy over the 6 January riot An alleged leader
of a paramilitary group that stormed the Capitol spoke of waiting for direction
from President Trump, prosecutors have said in a court filing. Jessica Watkins was
among a number of so-called Oath Keepers who changed into military dress and
walked on the Capitol after listening to Donald Trumpâs speech on 6 January. She was later seen
on a self-shot video in the Capitol building, and heard saying via walkie-talkie: ""We have a good groupâ¦ Sticking together and sticking to the plan."" The 38-year-old army veteran from Ohio has been charged with conspiracy. Prosecutors said,
ina document supporting her detention and published by CNN,external, she had ""trained and plotted for a
moment like this"". The document also
referenced a message she wrote after the November election expressing her
concern about taking action without Trumpâs backing: ""The [president] has the right
to activate units too. If Trump asks me to come, I will. Otherwise, I canât
trust it."" Jessica Watkins is a former army veteran Democratic prosecutors of Trump's second impeachment trial accused him of inciting the 6 January riots on Capitol Hill with a barrage of incendiary speeches and tweets following his election loss. The former president's lawyers will argue on Friday that he was exercising freedom of speech by calling the election a fraud, and never directly told his supporters to enter the Capitol building. Read more about the Oath Keepers and other US militia groups here. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter The House impeachment managers have finished presenting their case over the course of about 13 hours. Donald Trumpâs defence team will now get its turn. His lawyers will have up to 16 hours over two days to offer a rebuttal, although theyâre already saying they plan to wrap up by Friday evening. They feel like theyâre winning â and, if listening to Republican senators is any indication, theyâre probably right. After Trumpâs side finishes, senators will have up to four hours to present written questions to the legal teams. That will be followed by a debate and vote over whether to allow witnesses - if either side wants them. If they donât, or if the vote fails, both sides will make brief closing arguments followed by the final vote on Trumpâs fate. All told, this could wrap up as early as Saturday night or by Monday at the latest â less than a week from start to finish. That stands in stark contrast to Trumpâs last trial, which took three weeks, or President Andrew Johnsonâs proceedings in 1868, which had witnesses and took more than two months. Most of the Senate seems ready to move on as soon as possible â and it looks like theyâll get their wish. Barbara Plett UsherBBC News, US Capitol Democrats argued today that one of the reasons Donald Trump should be impeached is because he has damaged Americaâs standing in the international community. They said insurrectionists incited by Trump showed how easy it was to penetrate an American government building and foreign adversaries were probably taking notes. They argued that his actions gave authoritarian governments ammunition to defend their policies. China, for example, could more easily condemn democracy activists in Hong Kong as insurrectionists, said Congressman Joaquin Castro on the Senate floor, and Iran is mocking us. The world is watching to see whether rule of law prevails over rule of the mob in the United States â thatâs what weâre showing the world if we convict Donald Trump, he argued. How did you react to the new footage of the Capitol riot shown yesterday? Did it change your mind about whether Trump should be convicted or not? I'm catching the highlights of the trial. Trump should absolutely not be convicted. I'm not somebody who's just blinding myself to the facts. He didn't ask people to do anything violent. People showed up in advance planning violent acts, like the one person who planted some explosive devices the night before. Trump had nothing to do with that. There are obviously some bad elements that showed up intent on a violent protest long before Trump even spoke that day. I think Trump is a pretty smart guy who knows the effect his words have and I don't think he wanted the actual outcome of 6 January. David Schoen, left, and Bruce Castor, right, are leading the defence of former president Trump The next time we're back in the Senate chamber, we'll be hearing from Donald Trump's defence team. So who are they? Trump has two lawyers defending him during this trial:David Schoen, a trial lawyer from Alabama, andBruce Castor, a former district attorney. Schoen has previously represented Roger Stone, a former Trump adviser (who you may recall received a presidential pardon in December). Schoen also made headlines in the past  for meeting with Jeffrey 
Epstein in his final days to discuss possible representation, and for 
later saying he did not believe the death of the US financier and sex 
offender was suicide. Castor, a former Pennsylvania district attorney, is known for declining
 to prosecute Bill Cosby for sexual assault in 2005 - though Cosby was eventually convicted in a 2018 retrial. Read more about the key players in this impeachment trial here. Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri has been criticised for his demeanor during the impeachment trial: at one point, he sat with his feet up on a chair and watched the proceedings. Earlier, he was attacked for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results. Editorial writers at a Missouri newspaper have ripped into him for his actions, saying that he is an ""embarrassment"" to the state. He has alienated these editorial writers, and some ordinary voters too. Hawley's approval rating in the state dropped six points last month, according to a Morning Consult poll, from 42% to 36%. He seems unfazed, though, and has continued to hammer away at Democrats. On Thursday, Hawley told Fox News that the impeachment was a ""kangaroo trial"". He is likely to ramp up his arguments against the Democrats, as well as his aggressive language, if he decides to run for president in 2024, as many have predicted. Samantha GranvilleBBC News, Capitol Hill Senators have to be silent on the Senate floor, and though they havenât been very chatty outside, they are talking to the press. Most Republicans believe that there is no correlation between Trumpâs words and the actions of the insurrectionists. ""Today was not connecting the dots,â said Senator James Lanford. And Senator Jim Inhofe added: ""The more you hear it, the less credibility there is in it."" Senator Ted Cruz had some fiery words about the trial so far. ""If words like fight and win and take back our country now satisfy the legal standard for incitement, then every political candidate in the country...is about to be prosecuted."" Lawyers Bruce Castor and David Schoen will set out Trump's case Now that Democratic prosecutors have finished setting out
their case, itâs time for Donald Trumpâs lawyers to have their say. Attorneys Bruce Castor and David Schoen will have up to 16 hours over the
next two days to set out their defence, although they are not expected to use
all that time. On the opening day of the trial, they argued that Trump was
exercising his right to free speech, both in tweets and when he took to the
stage in front of supporters on 6 January. We are likely to hear more of this
line of argument from them. Earlier today, Schoen accused the Democrats of making ""movies"" and
presenting the case as an ""entertainment package"" with the video and audio
footage they showed the Senate. After Trumpâs team concludes their case, the Senate will have
up to four hours to ask written questions of both sides. Witnesses could also
be called but it is not yet clear if that will happen. If there are no witnesses, we could see a vote on conviction this weekend, or by Monday. As he concluded his argument, lead impeachment manager Jamie Raskin outlined some questions for Donald Trump's defence team. Donald Trump refused the chance to testify for himself, Raskin said, so Democrats pose these questions to his lawyers instead: And lastly, a legal question: Allow Twitter content?

That's a wrap on the opening arguments of the prosecution's case. Over the last three days, the House impeachment managers have argued that Trump incited the deadly siege at the US Capitol on 6 January. Now, the Senate has adjourned until tomorrow - when we'll hear from Trump's defence team. Congressman Jamie Raskin is closing his argument with direct appeals to the president's defence team. His message? A reminder that the question of whether the trial is allowed by law is over. ""We've put that jurisdictional, constitutional issue to bed,"" Raskin says. ""This is a trial on the facts of what happened and incitement is a fact-intensive investigation and a judgment each of you will have to make."" Joe Neguse has concluded summing up the evidence the prosecution has shared over the past two days. ""We humbly, humbly, ask you to convict,"" he says. ""Because if you donât... if we pretend this didnât happen, or worse if we let it go unanswered, whoâs to say it wonât happen again."" He turns the podium over to lead manager Jamie Raskin. Joe Neguse, the youngest member of the house impeachment team, is given the important job of recapping the evidence against Trump. A child of refugees from Eritrea, the 36-year-old is the first African-American congressman from the state of Colorado. He started making waves on social media yesterday when he presented a good portion of the evidence against the ex-president. Here's what people on Twitter are saying about him. Allow Twitter content?

""There are some who think that continuing down this path ... just keeps emotions enflamed. They would rather take the temperature down and get back to work,"" she said.

"Democrats have concluded their case that Trump incited the 6 January Capitol riot The prosecutors used rioters' own words to tie the former president to violence at the Capitol On Wednesday the trial was shown new footage of the violence Trump is accused of inciting The deadly riot at the US Capitol was an attempt by Trump supporters to stop the election result being certified Trump's lawyers have argued he has freedom of speech to declare the election fraudulent Seventeen Republicans will need to turn against their former president to convict him Edited by Marianna Brady and Ritu Prasad Thanks for tuning into our live coverage of the impeachment trial. We're done for now, but we'll be back tomorrow at11:30 EST/16:30 GMTas the defence team begins their arguments. In the meantime, you can follow updates to the story here. Here are the key moments from today:  Today's
 editors and writers were: Marianna Brady, 
Tom Spender, Ritu Prasad, Sam Cabral, Holly Honderich and Penny Spiller. The trial may be heading into the weekend, but we'll still be here breaking it all down for you. But until proceedings pick back up again tomorrow, here's a selection of our best explainers and features to check out: For four years, Mike Pence was a loyal vice-president to Donald Trump. He smoothed the rough edges of the Trump presidency, and Trump's supporters loved him for it. But on 6 January, the pro-Trump mob at the Capitol branded him a traitor, even chanting ""hang Mike Pence"". So what changed? This video can not be played How Mike Pence became a villain in Trump world There is at least one more full day left in the Senate trial, but the final outcome is all but set. Despite some acknowledgement from Republicans that Democratic impeachment managers have made powerful arguments, there's no indication it has changed any minds. Republican senators are still insisting that the trial remains unconstitutional, since Trump is now a private citizen, and is therefore a waste of time.

"This video can not be played Hancock on holiday uncertainty: ""People are smarter than all that."" It is ""too early"" to know whether summer holidays can go ahead, the health secretary has said. Matt Hancock said there was still ""a lot of uncertainty"" but ministers were doing everything possible to make sure people could have a holiday this year. He told the BBC he had booked his own summer break in Cornwall ""months ago"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer urged the government to ""get rid of the mixed messages"" about whether people should book holidays for later in the year. Some Tory MPs and businesses also criticised the government for fuelling uncertainty for travel companies already struggling in the pandemic. It follows confusion after Transport Secretary Grant Shapps warned ""people shouldn't be booking holidays right now - not domestically or internationally"". Downing Street said Prime Minister Boris Johnson would unveil a roadmap for easing restrictions - potentially including travel - in the week beginning 22 February. Analysis by BBC political correspondent Jonathan Blake For most announcements from the government, a day here or there might not make much difference. But nobody wants to wait any longer than necessary for the promised ""roadmap"" to take England out of lockdown. So when the prime minister promised that ""on 22 February"" he would reveal that plan, Conservative MPs were among those marking their diaries. But now Downing Street has said the roadmap will come ""on the week of the 22nd"" - which isn't quite the same. In response, Tory backbenchers are warning the government not to ""backslide"" on its promise. They want to hold ministers to their aim of giving schools two weeks' notice before re-opening to all pupils on 8 March. A vocal minority of Conservative MPs have argued the current lockdown is too strict and needs to lift as soon as possible. Others have been more patient and kept faith the government will take the right decisions at the right time. But the further cases fall, the more people get the vaccine and the longer time goes on, the more pressure on the government will grow. Mr Hancock told BBC Breakfast it was too early to know which coronavirus restrictions may still be in place over the summer, but that he understood people wanted to make plans. ""People are yearning for certainty over whether they can have a summer holiday"", he said, but ""pandemics are difficult times and there is a lot of uncertainty"". ""We are doing everything that we possibly can to make sure that people can have a holiday this summer but the vaccine rollout is absolutely essential to that,"" he continued. The health secretary also said that, before summer holidays, the priority would be making sure people can see loved ones again - but it was too early to say when this might happen. Holiday bookings jump despite 'unclear rules' Don't book holiday yet, government warns Starmer: 10-year Covid jail terms 'empty threat' The latest government figures,externalshow a total of 13,509,108 people have now received the first dose of a vaccine in the UK - a rise of 450,810 from Wednesday. The UK also reported another 678 people had died within 28 days of a positive Covid test, along with a further 13,494 new daily cases. Sir Jeremy Farrar, a member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said cases needed to fall below 10,000 a day before the UK should consider easing lockdown measures, with transmission rates still ""incredibly high"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it ""doesn't make any sense"" to set out plans to ease restrictions with arbitrary dates in March or April, adding that ""the data has to drive us"". ""In 2020 we lifted restrictions too quickly... as a result the transmission went back up in this country,"" he said. Dawn Dillon, from Surrey, says her husband booked a holiday to Spain in June 2019 for the following year as her birthday present. They were able to move the trip, which cost Â£1,000 for accommodation and flights, from 2020 to June 2021. ""But what do we do now - will we lose our holiday?"" she asks. ""I know it's not a priority but it would be nice to have some clarity."" Dawn, who is 55 and asthmatic, says she had anticipated that she would have had a Covid vaccine, along with her husband, before the trip in June. ""But you don't know how advanced the vaccination process is in other countries,"" she adds. Mr Johnson told a Downing Street briefing on Wednesday that as far as holidays were concerned, people would have to be a ""little bit more patient"". The PM's official spokesman said Mr Johnson does not have a holiday planned but ""is obviously keen to have a break over the summer"". But Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth criticised ministers for not being clearer about what the public could plan for. He said he had yet to book a holiday because he was ""in the same boat as everyone else"". Sir Keir said he had a ""holding"" booking for a break in Devon in August that is ""subject to restrictions, that's the best anybody can do"". Senior Conservative MP Sir Charles Walker accused ministers of ""ripping out"" the goalposts on the timetable for lifting Covid restrictions. People ""need to have something to look forward to"", he said. Matt Hancock has already booked a holiday to Cornwall after predicting a ""Great British summer"" One travel industry leader criticised the government's plea for people to stop making summer plansas ""puerile and nonsensical"". And Heathrow Airport's chief executive said getting back to normality was not just about people's holidays but also to ""protect people's businesses and livelihood"". Meanwhile, Henry Joce, of Tencreek Holiday Park and Campsite in Cornwall, told BBC Radio 5 Live it may be too late, not too soon, to book a spot there over certain dates this summer. He said soaring demand for breaks over the past fortnight meant he was at risk of selling out during peak weeks, which he put down to people ""being desperate to get away"".

"Democrats have concluded their case that Trump incited the 6 January Capitol riot The prosecutors used rioters' own words to tie the former president to violence at the Capitol On Wednesday the trial was shown new footage of the violence Trump is accused of inciting The deadly riot at the US Capitol was an attempt by Trump supporters to stop the election result being certified Trump's lawyers have argued he has freedom of speech to declare the election fraudulent Seventeen Republicans will need to turn against their former president to convict him Edited by Marianna Brady and Ritu Prasad Thanks for tuning into our live coverage of the impeachment trial. We're done for now, but we'll be back tomorrow at11:30 EST/16:30 GMTas the defence team begins their arguments. In the meantime, you can follow updates to the story here. Here are the key moments from today:  Today's
 editors and writers were: Marianna Brady, 
Tom Spender, Ritu Prasad, Sam Cabral, Holly Honderich and Penny Spiller. The trial may be heading into the weekend, but we'll still be here breaking it all down for you. But until proceedings pick back up again tomorrow, here's a selection of our best explainers and features to check out: For four years, Mike Pence was a loyal vice-president to Donald Trump. He smoothed the rough edges of the Trump presidency, and Trump's supporters loved him for it. But on 6 January, the pro-Trump mob at the Capitol branded him a traitor, even chanting ""hang Mike Pence"". So what changed? This video can not be played How Mike Pence became a villain in Trump world There is at least one more full day left in the Senate trial, but the final outcome is all but set. Despite some acknowledgement from Republicans that Democratic impeachment managers have made powerful arguments, there's no indication it has changed any minds. Republican senators are still insisting that the trial remains unconstitutional, since Trump is now a private citizen, and is therefore a waste of time. Here is what some Republicans are saying today: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington In their brief, Trumpâs lawyers used a time-honoured defence: their client, they argued, was âmisunderstoodâ. They also spelled United States wrong calling it the âUnites Statesâ, another sign of a hastily-put together document. They are planning to wrap up their argument in one day, a surprisingly short time, given the enormity of the charge - and one less day than they were allotted. The Democrats have built a detailed case against the former president over two days, with their arguments supported by chilling video of the violent assault on the Capitol. In contrast, when we heard from the defence earlier this week one lawyer, Bruce Castor, rambled, and even seemed confused. Trump was reportedly furious. You canread more about the scathing reviews here. Later, Castor insisted on Fox News that his client did in fact approve of their work, despite what people were saying. It was hardly a strong message - but heâll have a second chance to impress on Friday. We've heard a lot of people speak about Donald Trump over the past few days, but the man himself has been out of sight. Banned from Twitter, Trump has not shared his thoughts about the trial or much of anything else in his post-presidency. Here's what we do know. The former president now lives in Florida and on Tuesday he received some good news whenthe Palm Beach city council voted to allow his permanent residency at his club, Mar-a-Lago. Earlier today, according to CNN, he was spotted by one of their network's photographer playing a round of golf at his West Palm Beach course. He has declined to testify in the ongoing impeachment trial in Washington DC, with his lawyers slamming it as ""a publicity stunt"". Their defence starts tomorrow, but Trump will not be present. It remains unclear how much of the trial he is watching. Jessica Watkins (centre) is facing trial for conspiracy over the 6 January riot An alleged leader
of a paramilitary group that stormed the Capitol spoke of waiting for direction
from President Trump, prosecutors have said in a court filing. Jessica Watkins was
among a number of so-called Oath Keepers who changed into military dress and
walked on the Capitol after listening to Donald Trumpâs speech on 6 January. She was later seen
on a self-shot video in the Capitol building, and heard saying via walkie-talkie: ""We have a good groupâ¦ Sticking together and sticking to the plan."" The 38-year-old army veteran from Ohio has been charged with conspiracy. Prosecutors said,
ina document supporting her detention and published by CNN,external, she had ""trained and plotted for a
moment like this"". The document also
referenced a message she wrote after the November election expressing her
concern about taking action without Trumpâs backing: ""The [president] has the right
to activate units too. If Trump asks me to come, I will. Otherwise, I canât
trust it."" Jessica Watkins is a former army veteran Democratic prosecutors of Trump's second impeachment trial accused him of inciting the 6 January riots on Capitol Hill with a barrage of incendiary speeches and tweets following his election loss. The former president's lawyers will argue on Friday that he was exercising freedom of speech by calling the election a fraud, and never directly told his supporters to enter the Capitol building. Read more about the Oath Keepers and other US militia groups here. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter The House impeachment managers have finished presenting their case over the course of about 13 hours. Donald Trumpâs defence team will now get its turn. His lawyers will have up to 16 hours over two days to offer a rebuttal, although theyâre already saying they plan to wrap up by Friday evening. They feel like theyâre winning â and, if listening to Republican senators is any indication, theyâre probably right. After Trumpâs side finishes, senators will have up to four hours to present written questions to the legal teams. That will be followed by a debate and vote over whether to allow witnesses - if either side wants them. If they donât, or if the vote fails, both sides will make brief closing arguments followed by the final vote on Trumpâs fate. All told, this could wrap up as early as Saturday night or by Monday at the latest â less than a week from start to finish. That stands in stark contrast to Trumpâs last trial, which took three weeks, or President Andrew Johnsonâs proceedings in 1868, which had witnesses and took more than two months. Most of the Senate seems ready to move on as soon as possible â and it looks like theyâll get their wish. Barbara Plett UsherBBC News, US Capitol Democrats argued today that one of the reasons Donald Trump should be impeached is because he has damaged Americaâs standing in the international community. They said insurrectionists incited by Trump showed how easy it was to penetrate an American government building and foreign adversaries were probably taking notes. They argued that his actions gave authoritarian governments ammunition to defend their policies. China, for example, could more easily condemn democracy activists in Hong Kong as insurrectionists, said Congressman Joaquin Castro on the Senate floor, and Iran is mocking us. The world is watching to see whether rule of law prevails over rule of the mob in the United States â thatâs what weâre showing the world if we convict Donald Trump, he argued. How did you react to the new footage of the Capitol riot shown yesterday? Did it change your mind about whether Trump should be convicted or not? I'm catching the highlights of the trial. Trump should absolutely not be convicted. I'm not somebody who's just blinding myself to the facts. He didn't ask people to do anything violent. People showed up in advance planning violent acts, like the one person who planted some explosive devices the night before. Trump had nothing to do with that. There are obviously some bad elements that showed up intent on a violent protest long before Trump even spoke that day. I think Trump is a pretty smart guy who knows the effect his words have and I don't think he wanted the actual outcome of 6 January. David Schoen, left, and Bruce Castor, right, are leading the defence of former president Trump The next time we're back in the Senate chamber, we'll be hearing from Donald Trump's defence team. So who are they? Trump has two lawyers defending him during this trial:David Schoen, a trial lawyer from Alabama, andBruce Castor, a former district attorney. Schoen has previously represented Roger Stone, a former Trump adviser (who you may recall received a presidential pardon in December). Schoen also made headlines in the past  for meeting with Jeffrey 
Epstein in his final days to discuss possible representation, and for 
later saying he did not believe the death of the US financier and sex 
offender was suicide. Castor, a former Pennsylvania district attorney, is known for declining
 to prosecute Bill Cosby for sexual assault in 2005 - though Cosby was eventually convicted in a 2018 retrial. Read more about the key players in this impeachment trial here. Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri has been criticised for his demeanor during the impeachment trial: at one point, he sat with his feet up on a chair and watched the proceedings. Earlier, he was attacked for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results. Editorial writers at a Missouri newspaper have ripped into him for his actions, saying that he is an ""embarrassment"" to the state. He has alienated these editorial writers, and some ordinary voters too. Hawley's approval rating in the state dropped six points last month, according to a Morning Consult poll, from 42% to 36%. He seems unfazed, though, and has continued to hammer away at Democrats. On Thursday, Hawley told Fox News that the impeachment was a ""kangaroo trial"". He is likely to ramp up his arguments against the Democrats, as well as his aggressive language, if he decides to run for president in 2024, as many have predicted. Samantha GranvilleBBC News, Capitol Hill Senators have to be silent on the Senate floor, and though they havenât been very chatty outside, they are talking to the press. Most Republicans believe that there is no correlation between Trumpâs words and the actions of the insurrectionists. ""Today was not connecting the dots,â said Senator James Lanford. And Senator Jim Inhofe added: ""The more you hear it, the less credibility there is in it."" Senator Ted Cruz had some fiery words about the trial so far. ""If words like fight and win and take back our country now satisfy the legal standard for incitement, then every political candidate in the country...is about to be prosecuted."" Lawyers Bruce Castor and David Schoen will set out Trump's case Now that Democratic prosecutors have finished setting out
their case, itâs time for Donald Trumpâs lawyers to have their say. Attorneys Bruce Castor and David Schoen will have up to 16 hours over the
next two days to set out their defence, although they are not expected to use
all that time. On the opening day of the trial, they argued that Trump was
exercising his right to free speech, both in tweets and when he took to the
stage in front of supporters on 6 January. We are likely to hear more of this
line of argument from them. Earlier today, Schoen accused the Democrats of making ""movies"" and
presenting the case as an ""entertainment package"" with the video and audio
footage they showed the Senate. After Trumpâs team concludes their case, the Senate will have
up to four hours to ask written questions of both sides. Witnesses could also
be called but it is not yet clear if that will happen. If there are no witnesses, we could see a vote on conviction this weekend, or by Monday. As he concluded his argument, lead impeachment manager Jamie Raskin outlined some questions for Donald Trump's defence team. Donald Trump refused the chance to testify for himself, Raskin said, so Democrats pose these questions to his lawyers instead: And lastly, a legal question: Allow Twitter content?

That's a wrap on the opening arguments of the prosecution's case. Over the last three days, the House impeachment managers have argued that Trump incited the deadly siege at the US Capitol on 6 January. Now, the Senate has adjourned until tomorrow - when we'll hear from Trump's defence team. Congressman Jamie Raskin is closing his argument with direct appeals to the president's defence team. His message? A reminder that the question of whether the trial is allowed by law is over. ""We've put that jurisdictional, constitutional issue to bed,"" Raskin says. ""This is a trial on the facts of what happened and incitement is a fact-intensive investigation and a judgment each of you will have to make."" Joe Neguse has concluded summing up the evidence the prosecution has shared over the past two days. ""We humbly, humbly, ask you to convict,"" he says. ""Because if you donât... if we pretend this didnât happen, or worse if we let it go unanswered, whoâs to say it wonât happen again."" He turns the podium over to lead manager Jamie Raskin. Joe Neguse, the youngest member of the house impeachment team, is given the important job of recapping the evidence against Trump. A child of refugees from Eritrea, the 36-year-old is the first African-American congressman from the state of Colorado. He started making waves on social media yesterday when he presented a good portion of the evidence against the ex-president. Here's what people on Twitter are saying about him. Allow Twitter content?

Republicans in Congress are ""so tired"" after years of being led by Donald Trump that many just want to put this episode behind them, a former senior Republican Senate staff member says. Antonia Ferrier told the BBC's Ros Atkins that there were a variety of reasons why Republicans are unlikely to vote for Mr Trump's impeachment even though the Democrats have put together a ""very compelling"" case against him. ""There are some who think that continuing down this path ... just keeps emotions enflamed. They would rather take the temperature down and get back to work,"" she said. ""Many of them just want this chapter to be over, after four years of Donald Trump, they are just tired of the man."" You can watch more of Ms Ferrier's interview here: Allow Twitter content?

footage they showed the Senate. After Trumpâs team concludes their case, the Senate will have
up to four hours to ask written questions of both sides. Witnesses could also
be called but it is not yet clear if that will happen. If there are no witnesses, we could see a vote on conviction this weekend, or by Monday. As he concluded his argument, lead impeachment manager Jamie Raskin outlined some questions for Donald Trump's defence team. Donald Trump refused the chance to testify for himself, Raskin said, so Democrats pose these questions to his lawyers instead: And lastly, a legal question: Allow Twitter content?

That's a wrap on the opening arguments of the prosecution's case. Over the last three days, the House impeachment managers have argued that Trump incited the deadly siege at the US Capitol on 6 January. Now, the Senate has adjourned until tomorrow - when we'll hear from Trump's defence team. Congressman Jamie Raskin is closing his argument with direct appeals to the president's defence team. His message? A reminder that the question of whether the trial is allowed by law is over. ""We've put that jurisdictional, constitutional issue to bed,"" Raskin says. ""This is a trial on the facts of what happened and incitement is a fact-intensive investigation and a judgment each of you will have to make."" Joe Neguse has concluded summing up the evidence the prosecution has shared over the past two days. ""We humbly, humbly, ask you to convict,"" he says. ""Because if you donât... if we pretend this didnât happen, or worse if we let it go unanswered, whoâs to say it wonât happen again."" He turns the podium over to lead manager Jamie Raskin. Joe Neguse, the youngest member of the house impeachment team, is given the important job of recapping the evidence against Trump. A child of refugees from Eritrea, the 36-year-old is the first African-American congressman from the state of Colorado. He started making waves on social media yesterday when he presented a good portion of the evidence against the ex-president. Here's what people on Twitter are saying about him. Allow Twitter content?

Republicans in Congress are ""so tired"" after years of being led by Donald Trump that many just want to put this episode behind them, a former senior Republican Senate staff member says. Antonia Ferrier told the BBC's Ros Atkins that there were a variety of reasons why Republicans are unlikely to vote for Mr Trump's impeachment even though the Democrats have put together a ""very compelling"" case against him. ""There are some who think that continuing down this path ... just keeps emotions enflamed. They would rather take the temperature down and get back to work,"" she said. ""Many of them just want this chapter to be over, after four years of Donald Trump, they are just tired of the man."" You can watch more of Ms Ferrier's interview here: Allow Twitter content?

"The go-ahead for the next phase of Britainâs controversial HS2 high-speed rail network has been approved. Phase 2A of the project will be built from the West Midlands to Crewe, and was given Royal Assent on Thursday. Supporters of HS2 say it will spur economic growth, help level up the country, and provide greener transport. But environmentalists say it will increase carbon emissions and canât be justified now people have embraced video conferencing such as Zoom. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said: ""Whatever your view of this project, HS2 is now a reality - heading north, creating jobs and building a brighter future for our country. ""This vital project is at the heart of the government's commitments to build back better from the pandemic, tackle the North-South divide and drive growth across the country. ""I look forward to seeing spades in the ground to get this section built and deliver the benefits of high-speed rail to the North as swiftly as possible."" But critics argue that the justification for building HS2 was ever-increasing rail passenger numbers. And the government now admits future passenger growth is unknowable. HS2 Minister Andrew Stephenson recently said: ""If the first reaction to the pandemic is to cancel major infrastructure projects committed to by successive governments now for more than a decadeâ¦ that would have a chilling impact on the construction sector in the UK and inward investment.â Caroline Davies, BBC transport correspondent A year since the prime minister announced that HS2 would be built, another phase has been given the go ahead. But this project still has more hurdles to go. While phase 2a was anticipated to be signed off, the rest of the proposed route - from Crewe to Manchester and the eastern leg, connecting Birmingham and Leeds - are both still in the works. Businesses and local politicians campaigning for these routes have called on the government to commit to the rest of the project to avoid an east-west divide in transport in the North. The project still has its critics, from environmental campaigners to those who argue new capacity isn't needed with new remote ways of working. Passenger services won't start on the first parts of the line until at least 2029, and arguments about the project aren't over yet. MPs voted overwhelmingly for the project, but some still question its value for money. Chesham and Amersham MP Dame Cheryl Gillan asked whether the cost could be justified when ministers âhave not established that the future use of public transport will be at a level that will make this railway viable in any way, shape or form?â Green MP Caroline Lucas called it a âvanity projectâ. She says travel patterns have been revolutionised during Covid, and won't return to previous levels. And she complained: âItâll take decades for the project to have even a chance of becoming carbon neutral because of the emissions from building the line. ""Meanwhile dozens of ancient woodlands are being put at risk or damaged â the very woodlands we should be protecting to help tackle climate change.â Green campaigners are still hiding out in tunnels under Euston station to make their protest against the schemeâs impact on the climate and wildlife. Court rejects protesters' bid to remain in tunnels HS2 tunnel activists in 'very dangerous' situation HS2 downgrade 'will short-change millions' Tony May, Emeritus Transport Professor at Leeds University, said: âEven on optimistic predictions HS2 takes 65 years from its completion  before its carbon saving (through low-carbon trains) has offset the carbon costs of construction. âSo up to 2050 (the critical deadline for achieving nearly zero emissions) HS2 is a carbon burden on the country. It doesn't save carbon at all.â The company says it is working on smarter designs to reduce the carbon impact of the materials it uses. The first phase of HS2 between London and the West Midlands is already well underway. There are 240 sites now active along the Phase One route. HS2 says it employs over 13,000 people with 400 apprenticeships, and tens of thousands more jobs supported through the supply chain. Campaigners have staged anti-HS2 protests in London and elsewhere. Passenger services are scheduled to start between stations at Londonâs Old Oak Common and Birmingham Curzon Street between 2029-33. Phase 2Aâs opening will coincide with the LondonâBirmingham route. HS2 A will carry six long-distance high speed services per hour. Sara Williams, chief executive of Staffordshire Chamber of Commerce, said: âExtending the high speed line northwards will generate thousands of contract opportunities for local businesses and provide a vital boost for the Staffordshire economy.â Critics say the government could have created far more jobs for the same amount of money by developing a labour-intensive national scheme to renovate leaky homes â an activity that would actively reduce carbon emissions.

"Amsterdam ousted London as the largest financial trading centre in Europe last month as Brexit-related changes to finance rules came into force. About â¬9.2bn (Â£8.1bn) worth of shares were traded on Amsterdam exchanges each day, against â¬8.6bn in London. Following new Brexit rules, EU-based banks wanting to buy European shares currently cannot trade via London, meaning a loss of fees for City firms. Bank of England chief Andrew Bailey has warned the EU not to cut off London. On Wednesday, Mr Bailey said there were signs that the EU planned to cut the UK off from its financial markets. Following the new Brexit trading rules coming into effect, there are talks to harmonise rules over financial regulations - so-called equivalence Both sides are working towards a March deadline to agree an ""equivalence"" regime under which the UK and Europe would recognise the other's regulations. Number 10, said it remained ""open"" to discussions with the EU on the equivalence issue. ""Despite the fact that we've supplied all of the necessary paperwork and are one of the world's most preeminent financial centres, with a strong regulatory system, the EU still haven't granted us full equivalence."" ""This has meant that some EU shares that were previously traded on UK venues have moved to the EU venues on advice of the European regulator, but our position is fragmentation of share trading across financial centres is in no one's interest,"" it added. It's called invisible trade - but selling services abroad is something the UK excels in, particularly when it comes to banking. Financial services makes up about 7% of the UK's income in total, and about 40% of banking and investment's business abroad is with the EU. But its needs were largely invisible from the deal struck with the EU at the end of last year. The diversion of share trading is the first visible, if inevitable, sign of the impact. And that business may not return to London. Even if the UK government and Brussels can ultimately reach agreement that financial services can get more access to each others markets, on the basis the UK's standards can be deemed ""equivalent"" to the EU's, share dealing may not be part of that. The UK government hopes Brexit will enhance the City's dominance, with scope to deepen relationships with other financial centres. But that's a work in progress. The boss of one share exchange described a recently-struck deal that allows Swiss shares to be traded in London as being like a free kick in a football match rather than an equaliser: it doesn't compensate for what has been lost in loosening ties with Europe. Mr Bailey said the City wanted to reach an agreement on financial rules, but would not accept being ""dictated"" to by Brussels. He said EU demands had so far been unreasonable. ""I'm afraid a world in which the EU dictates and determines which rules and standards we have in the UK isn't going to work,"" the governor said in his annual Mansion House speech to the City, this year held virtually. ""Is the EU going to cut the UK off from itself? There are signs of an intention to do so at the moment but I think that would be a mistake,"" he added. ""We have to state the argument for global standards and markets and openness and if we all sign up to that then there's no need to go in that direction."" Brexit: Barclays urges UK to focus on US and Asia How will London change after Brexit? Brexit 'crunch time' for City of London Financial services - a key driver of the UK economy - were largely omitted from the last-minute Brexit trade deal agreed in December. The City generates about Â£135bn in business annually, with financial institutions earning big fees from trading stocks and shares. But London's financial centre has been cut off from EU markets since 1 January. But Brussels says it will not be rushed into decisions on granting access for UK financial firms, as it wants to see how far UK rules will diverge from its own. It follows fears the UK will adopt a low-regulation Singapore-style model that would undercut the EU. Mr Bailey said the EU was holding the UK to unrealistically high standards on the issue of divergence, saying it would in effect make the City a ""rule taker"". He added that while some UK rules would change post-Brexit, sudden deregulation was not on the cards. ""Let me be clear, none of this means that the UK should or will create a low-regulation, high-risk, anything-goes financial centre and system,"" he said. ""We have an overwhelming body of evidence that such an approach is not in our own interests, let alone anyone else's."" Despite the current situation, Mr Bailey said that London would ""undoubtedly continue as one of the world's leading if not the leading financial centre"". Last month Mr Bailey said up to 7,000 finance jobs had so far been relocated from London to rival centres in the EU - well down on predictions of as many as 50,000 losses.

"Police found Dylan Freeman in his mother's bed surrounded by toys A mother who suffocated her disabled 10-year-old boy after reaching her ""wits' end"" during lockdown has been detained in hospital indefinitely. Dylan Freeman's body was found in Acton, west London, on 16 August with a sponge in his mouth. His mother Olga Freemanpleaded guilty at the Old Bailey to manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility. The judge said Dylan was ""an indirect victim of interruption to normal life caused by the Covid-19 pandemic."" Freeman was sentenced to a hospital order under theMental Health Act,externalwithout a limit of time. Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb said it was a ""rare and desperately sad"" case. Dylan had autism, Cohen syndrome - which is linked to abnormalities in many parts of the body - and significant difficulties with language and communication. Olga Freeman had booked flights abroad the night before Dylan's body was found Prosecutor Gareth Patterson QC said Dylan required round-the-clock care and had attended a special school five days a week but had been unable to go during the lockdown as it had shut. This took a toll on Freeman, the court heard. Mr Patterson added: ""Last year during the first lockdown and through the summer she struggled more and more with her son. ""Eventually she suffered a mental health breakdown."" Dylan's body was found at a house in Cumberland Park, Acton Police found Dylan in a bedroom lying on his back covered by a duvet after Freeman had walked into a police station to report she had killed her child. A post-mortem found he died from restriction of the airways frompieces of sponge that had been stuffed in his mouth. Psychiatrist Dr Martin Lock said Freeman had ""developed psychotic symptoms when under very heavy stress because of the Covid-19 lockdown"". Requests were made to increase support for Dylan's care but Ealing Council appeared to be ""slow"" in responding, the court heard. Mr Patterson said: ""The council does seem to have been slow in determining her requests for increased financial assistance and she felt let down by the council."" The court heard a serious case review was expected to conclude shortly. Sentencing Freeman, Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb said the burden of looking after Dylan meant she had reached her ""wits' end"". She added: ""I have no doubt at all that you were a remarkably loving and dedicated mother to a vulnerable child until multiple pressures overwhelmed you and your mind was swamped by a destructive illness with florid psychotic elements."" Mother admits suffocating son with sponge Murder accused mum's son 'had restricted airways' Murder accused mum 'admitted killing in call' After sentencing, Ealing Council said Dylan had received 30 hours of care a week - 16 of which were council-funded. ""It is clear from the evidence from the review so far, that this death could not have been foreseen,"" it said.

"This video can not be played Health Secretary Matt Hancock: 'We need to build a better, stronger NHS' The NHS in England is to be reformed so health and care services can work more closely together, the government says. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the planned restructure will mean a focus ""on the health of the population, not just the health of patients"". But Labour questioned the timing of the changes ""in the middle of the biggest public health crisis our NHS has ever faced"", saying staff were exhausted. Mr Hancock said there was ""no better time than now"". Afull White Paper,externalwas published on Thursday, setting out the proposed future legislation. ""The pandemic has made the changes in this White Paper more not less urgent,"" Mr Hancock told MPs. Year-long hospital waits for 225,000 in England Reforms planned for NHS in England Social care reform needed within a year - NHS boss The shake-up will see the law changed to reverse reforms of the NHS in England introduced under Prime Minister David Cameron in 2012. Ministers believe the changes will put the NHS in a better position to cope with an ageing population and a rise in people with complex health conditions. One-in-three patients admitted to hospital as an emergency has five or more health conditions, such as diabetes, obesity or asthma, up from one-in-10 a decade ago. Those working in the health service said many of the rules in place were time-consuming, frustrating and stressful. Announcing the changes to MPs, Mr Hancock said the new system would see the NHS and local councils take decisions about local health together. ""The new approach is based on the concept of population health,"" he said. Organisations called ""integrated care systems"" - which already exist in some parts of the country - will be set up in each part of England and be responsible for funding to support that area's health. ""They will provide not just for the treatments that are needed but support people to stay healthy in the first place,"" said Mr Hancock. Responding to criticism over the timing, Mr Hancock said the pandemic had ""brought home the importance of preventing ill health in the first place"". Nigel Edwards, of the Nuffield Trust think tank, said the changes would be a ""re-wiring behind the dashboard"" and should not be too noticeable to patients. While it was not a ""magic bullet"", it could help different parts of the system work more closely together, he added. The public will be rightly asking what difference these reforms make and why they are being introduced now in the middle of a pandemic. The concept predates Covid - councils and the NHS have been piloting these approaches to integrated care over the past few years. But, in many ways, the pandemic has speeded up the process. With more care being done out of hospital because of the pressures from Covid, community NHS and council care teams have been working ever more closely. There is much to recommend greater joined up working. The 21st century patient has multiple conditions. Take a 70-year-old with heart problem and dementia who lives alone. They will need input from a heart specialist, support from community nurses and maybe the company of a befriending service. The staff needed could come from three different organisations working and funded separately.  It creates bureaucracy and it is not hard to see how the quality of care suffers. The white paper is an attempt to re-wire the NHS. But those working for the NHS argue that is just one part of the solution - staffing and investment will also play a role. The proposals include scrapping the tendering rule, which sees providers and private companies compete to win contracts to run services. This rule made it complicated for councils and different parts of the NHS to set up joint teams and pool their budgets, with some having to set up separate bodies to bid for contracts. Instead, the NHS and councils will be left to run services and told to collaborate with each other to pool resources. It also gives the health secretary more control over NHS England and other national bodies, which had been given a large degree of autonomy under the 2012 changes. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said Labour had long argued for more integrated care, but raised questions over the timing. He also said the test of the reorganisation ""will be whether it brings waiting lists and times down, widens access especially for mental healthcare, drives up cancer survival rates and improves population health"". Mr Ashworth added that ""legislation alone of course is not the answer to integration. ""We need a long-term funded workforce plan. We've not got one. We need a sustainable social care plan. We were promised one on the steps of Downing Street. We still don't have one."" The UK's social care systemis under pressurewith past governments failing to reform or fund the council-run system properly. In their 2019 election manifesto, the Conservatives pledged to find a cross-party solution to reduce pressures on the sector and provide long-term funding. Mr Hancock told MPs the government was ""committed to the reform of adult social care and will bring forward proposals this year"". 11 charts on what's happened to the NHS Meanwhile, NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens said the reform will create a ""flexible can-do spirit"" across the health and care system. The White Paper will cite examples of good practice, such as a care team at the Royal Derby Hospital which sees nurses from the community, council care services and hospital staff working together to plan the discharge of patients. Chris Hopson, of NHS Providers, which represents NHS managers, said it would end ""an unnecessarily rigid NHS approach to procurement"". The Local Government Association welcomed the plans but said they did not provide the funding to put care services on a ""sustainable and long-term footing"".

"Social media posts by Gina Carano, who plays Cara Dune on The Mandalorian, have been called ""abhorrent and unacceptable"" by Lucasfilm. In a statement, a spokesperson said: ""Gina Carano is not currently employed by Lucasfilm and there are no plans for her to be in the future."" The hashtag #FireGinaCarano trended on Twitter for hours following a story shared on her Instagram, that some branded anti-Semitic. It has since been deleted. In the post, the former MMA fighter compared ""hating someone for their political views"" in the US to the treatment of Jewish people leading up to the Holocaust in Nazi Germany. Millions of Jewish people and other minorities were killed at the hands of the Nazis during World War Two. Gina Carano starred alongside Pedro Pascal in Lucasfilm's first live-action series This isn't the first time the 38-year-old actress, who's played Cara Dune in the hit show on Disney Plus for two seasons, has been controversial on social media. Back in November Star Wars fanscalled for her to to be firedafter she put up several posts supporting Donald Trump. She openly questioned whether vote counting during the US presidential election was fair, something President Donald Trump had said repeatedly. The actor tweeted: ""We need to clean up the election process so we are not left feeling the way we do today. Put laws in place that protect us against voter fraud."" There hasnever been any evidenceto support President Trump's claims of voter fraud. She has also previously made fun of people who wear masks during the pandemic. Star Wars actor John Boyega at BLM protests in London Star Wars actor John Boyega, and Carano's Mandalorian co-stars Carl Weathers and Pedro Pascal have also posted about their own beliefs, whether it's support of Joe Biden or for the Black Lives Matter movement. Back in August Carano was asked to show her support for BLM. When she didn't post anything online, some on social media accused her of being racist. She responded saying: ""In my experience, screaming at someone that they are a racist when they are indeed NOT a racist & any post and/or research you do will show you those exact facts, then I'm sorry, these people are not 'educators.' They are cowards and bullies."" She's also been defended by some fans, saying she's a victim of ""cancel culture"". After the release of Lucasfilm's statement, some social media users launched a campaign to boycott Disney Plus, the streaming service which airs The Mandalorian. The hashtag #CancelDisneyPlus has also been trending. Variety is also reporting that Gina Carano has been dropped by her agent United Talent Agency.

"University of Hull student Libby Squire was last seen in the early hours of 1 February 2019 A serial sex offender has been found guilty of raping and murdering a student before dumping her body in a river. Pawel Relowicz, 26, prowled the streets of Hull before attacking ""vulnerable"" 21-year-old Libby Squire. Jurors heard Relowicz had committed a string of offences against women prior to the killing. Speaking outside Sheffield Crown Court, Libby's mother paid tribute to her ""beautiful, caring, wonderful girl"". During the trial, prosecutor Richard Wright QC said Relowicz had spent the night of 31 January 2019 driving around looking for a woman to attack. The killer at the window Jurors heard University of Hull philosophy student Ms Squire, who had been turned away from a nightclub, was drunk and ""extremely vulnerable"" when Relowicz ""intercepted"" her . He drove her to Oak Road playing fields, where he attacked her before putting her in the River Hull. Prosecutors said the married father-of-two had repeatedly lied to police, his wife and in court documents about what happened on the night of Ms Squire's disappearance. Pawel Relowicz had previously committed a string of sexual offences against women He maintained he had consensual sex with the student and said he had lied because he did not want his wife to find out he had cheated on her. After a massive search effort, Ms Squire's remains were found in the Humber Estuary almost two months later. Her parents, Lisa and Russ, held hands and cried as they sat in the public gallery overlooking the courtroom to await the verdicts. Speaking outside court, Mrs Squire thanked supporters but said Relowicz's conviction ""changes nothing for us, there is no closure"". ""We don't get to have Libby back and our lives don't revert back to normal,"" she said. ""Libby will always be with us and we are all so proud of our beautiful, caring, wonderful girl. ""And, although she has been physically taken from us, the memories we have and the love we share will never be.""

He will be sentenced on Friday. Jurors found him guilty of rape unanimously and guilty of murder by a majority verdict of 11 to one. Pathologists were unable to establish how she died, or whether she was still alive when she went into the water. Witnessesreported hearing screamsfrom the playing fields on the night she disappeared. Gerry Wareham, from the Crown Prosecution Service said CCTV footage of Relowicz and Ms Squire's last known movements was ""crucial evidence"" in bringing the case to court. This video can not be played Footage of Libby Squire and Pawel Relowicz's movements was shown to jurors During the 14-day trial, the jury of seven women and five men heard Relowicz hadprevious convictions for voyeurism, performing sex acts in public and stealing sex toys and underwear from women's homes. One ofhis previous voyeurism victims told the BBCshe hoped the police would learn from the case. She said his earlier offences were ""sufficiently minor"" by themselves ""to not actually require the level of investigation that would result in him being caught"". In a statement, Humberside Police said it was ""satisfied"" with its investigation and that officers ""acted quickly"" to identify, locate and apprehend the defendant within days of Ms Squire's disappearance. Det Supt Martin Smalley said: ""I can understand that people are interested to know whether Libby's tragic death could have been prevented. ""It is important to remember that whilst, taken as a whole, and with the benefit of hindsight, we may be able to point to a history of offending by Pawel Relowicz, officers investigating these offences at the time were doing so with far less information than we have now and that my investigation into Libby's disappearance had."" Det Supt Smalley said the investigation was ""one of the most challenging and emotional cases"" in his 30-year career The University of Hull said it would continue to offer support to the student community. Vice-Chancellor Prof Susan Lea said in a statement: ""What took place in February 2019 deeply affected everyone at the university and those within the local community. ""Libby made a huge impact during her time at Hull, and will be remembered fondly by all who met her."" She said the ""kindness and care shown by everyone was overwhelming"" both at the university and in the wider community.

"Some who received the jab earlier in the vaccine programme will soon get their second dose The number of vaccines supplied to Wales is expected to fall in the next few weeks, affecting some of the country's vaccination centres. Cwm Taf Morgannwg Health Board says it is pausing vaccinations at four centres for a fortnight. Local politicians say it is because of a fall in the supply of the Pfizer-BioNTech jab. Other vaccinations centres are expected to reduce their hours. First Minister Mark Drakeford said the drop in supply had been planned for. The Welsh Government said the reduction in supply would affect the whole of the UK. It comes after Wales became the first UK nation on Wednesday to have givenfirst doses to 20% of the population, after a slow start. The government said it was on course to meet its mid-February target of offering a jab to the over 70s, health care workers and the clinically extremely vulnerable. Can Wales meet its Covid-19 vaccine targets? Clarity call on remaining over-70s' vaccines When, where and how will I get my Covid vaccine? But officials are expecting fewer doses of the AstraZeneca jab - which has been mostly delivered in GP surgeries rather than vaccination centres - before deliveries return to recent levels from the beginning of March. Health boards will determine how vaccines are delivered over the next two weeks, with mass vaccination centres changing their opening times to reflect the reduction in supply. Health officials however, say they have sufficient stocks of Pfizer vaccine to significantly increase the number of second doses next week, as those who had a first dose in December are now due for their next injection. Mr Drakeford told a Welsh Parliament committee: ""We know that we are going to get less vaccine over the next few weeks than we have over the past few weeks."" ""That was planned for and known for and is accommodated in our plans which remain to complete the vaccination of those next five priority groups by the spring. ""So, without unforeseen barriers, we are confident that we will remain on track."" He said plans remain in place to complete vaccinations of the next five priority groups by the spring. Mr Drakeford said the Welsh NHS ""will be focusing our Pfizer vaccine supply on the second vaccination of those people in the top four priority groups who have already had their first vaccine"". ""We will be deploying the Astra Zeneca vaccine for first shots for people in the next five groups,"" he said. ""We will hear, I'm afraid, from people disappointed that the amount of supply they're getting is less than we've had over the last couple of weeks because we could use more. ""If there was more, we could use it, there's no doubt about that."" The vaccination programme will soon be targeting groups further down the priority list - with jabs due to be given to people over the age of 65 and people with underlying health conditions. The military have been assisting with the vaccine programme Health officials say the next two weeks' reduction in supply is planned for - allowing manufacturers to ramp up their production processes, which will lead to significant increases in vaccines from the start of March. Wales is looking to deliver 103,000 more doses next week - 56,000 Astra-Zeneca vaccines will be mainly first doses and 46,000 Pfizer which will be to push on with second doses for those in the priority groups. Another 108,000 doses would be given out the following week but then numbers would rise to 160,000 to 190,000 and accelerating. Last Sunday, Cwm Taf Morgannwg was the best performing of all health boards in giving doses to its 70 to 74-year-olds, according to Public Health Wales figures. The health board's executive director Clare Williams, said the switch to the next phase of vaccination will allow a ""pause"" from 16 February ""for two weeks at our four community vaccination centres in Merthyr Tydfil, Abercynon, Rhondda and Bridgend"". Vaccination of health and social care workers, and those aged 70-74, is now ""nearly complete,"" she said. ""It has always been our intention to bring vaccines as close to where people live as we possibly can.  Therefore, during this two-week pause, we will be looking at the locations of all four of our community vaccination centres (CVCs) to ensure they are in the best locations for residents."" The board hopes to expand to seven CVCs, with new centres at Aberfan Leisure Centre, Llantrisant Leisure Centre and Cynon Valley Indoor Bowls in Mountain Ash, and Maesteg Leisure Centre. Plaid Cymru's Rhun ap Iorwerth said: ""Transparency is key in maintaining public trust. Everyone involved in the vaccine rollout has done a fantastic job in vaccinating 20% of the Welsh population, but we need to see the flow of vaccines into the four UK nations, to have confidence that we are getting our fair share."" Welsh Conservative MS Angela Burns said:  ""The Conservative UK Government - which is procuring the supplies - is confident that the steady stream of doses will continue, and this underlines the benefit of being in a strong United Kingdom that works for Wales."" Huw Thomas, BBC Wales correspondent Mass vaccination centres could see their hours reduced The Welsh NHS has planned for reduced supplies over the coming weeks, as have health officials in other parts of the UK. As a result, the news that some vaccine centres will close temporarily is no surprise to the people manning them. It also comes as Wales appears to have reached its milestone of offering a vaccine to everyone in the top four priority groups by the middle of February. No appointments should be cancelled as a result of the lower doses reaching Wales, and it is not expected to impact the longer-term plan to offer a dose to the top nine priority groups by the spring. From next week the vaccine statistics will also reflect the increasing numbers of second doses being administered in Wales, as those who were among the first to be vaccinated in the weeks before Christmas are now due to begin receiving their second dose. Stocks of the Pfizer vaccine will be prioritised for second doses in the coming weeks, ensuring nobody faces a delay in receiving their full immunisation. A Welsh Government spokesman said: ""We have factored this into our plans and it will not affect people's appointments or delay when people are due to get their second dose. ""The supply of vaccines is expected to ramp up significantly from the beginning of March. ""Every dose of vaccine we receive will continue to be delivered immediately to all those who need it. Our vaccination teams continue to do an incredible job to vaccinate everyone as quickly as possible."" The UK government spokesman said: ""We are confident that the steady, regular supply of doses will continue to support the vaccine rollout in the weeks ahead. ""If you get called for a vaccine, please continue go to your appointment."" Can Wales meet its Covid-19 vaccine targets? How many people have been vaccinated in Wales?

"This video can not be played Citing the suffragettes, Stella Creasy calls for all MPs to be given parental leave and not just those serving as ministers. Labour's Stella Creasy is threatening legal action against the government after they did not include all MPs in maternity cover plans. The government has passed a new law so senior ministers do not have to resign if they have a baby. The move was prompted by Attorney General Suella Braverman, who is due to give birth next month. Ms Creasy, who is also pregnant, welcomed the change, but said it should not just apply to those at the top. Backbench MPs are allowed take informal maternity leave, but not all their duties are covered during their absence. The situation is different for ministers, who are not able to take time off from their positions. Law change to allow maternity leave for minister 'Locum MP' to cover Stella Creasy maternity Under the old system, they had to resign from their ministerial jobs if they want maternity leave, although they continued to receive their MPs' salary. But with the government's changes, Ms Braverman and other cabinet ministers are now able to take six months' leave on full ministerial pay, and the salary costs for a temporary replacement will be covered. In 2019, Stella Creasy became the first MP to be given locum maternity leave cover, after a battle with the parliamentary authorities, who, she says, had told her it was not possible under Commons rules. The government's decision to push theMinisterial and Other Maternity Allowances Bill,externalthrough Parliament in a single day shows that it is possible, the Walthamstow MP said. She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I think every woman should be able to have paid maternity cover, proper cover - it's not just about being paid, it's that somebody else will be doing that job - so Suella Braverman will be able to take proper leave with her child."" Attorney General Suella Braverman is due to give birth next month Ms Creasy, who is expecting her second child, said lawyers had advised her the changes were discriminatory as they only benefitted senior ministers, and not other members of Parliament. ""I am very prepared to go to court over this, because it is a form of direct discrimination... as a backbencher, none of these provisions will apply to myself, it's still very unclear what I can tell my constituents they can get in terms of cover,"" she told Today. ""Thousands of pregnant women are facing risks in the workplace, including the risk of the loss of their job. The message that we're sending is that we treat maternity leave like a benefit, like a company car."" Cabinet Office Minister Penny Mordaunt told MPs the bill to change maternity rights for senior ministers was an ""important and well overdue change"". She said alterations in the Ministerial Code in 2019 allowed for other members of the government to take over roles from a junior minister on maternity leave. The bill puts to an end the ""wholly unacceptable"" situation of senior ministers resigning to allow other government members to take over their departments while on maternity leave, she said in the Commons. Minister Penny Mordaunt said the law would make for an ""important and well overdue change"". Ms Braverman said she was grateful to Boris Johnson and the Conservatives for ""leading this historic change to support women in the workplace"". Labour did not oppose the changes in the Commons. Former Work and Pensions Secretary Yvette Cooper told MPs it had been 20 years since she was the first junior minister - then in the Department of Health - to take maternity leave. She warned the changes were ""limited"" as they did not have any provisions for male ministers to take longer paternity leave. Ms Cooper said that when she needed to take maternity leave two decades ago: ""I asked the health secretary what I should do, he didn't know, he said ask the prime minister, he didn't know, he said ask the cabinet secretary he said he had no idea. ""As ministers are Crown appointments, he said it was really a matter for the Queen, but nobody thought we should be asking Her Majesty."" The MP said they ""then tried to work something out"" that was similar to the arrangements for civil servants, but ""no one had thought about it before - that was bad enough 20 years ago"". She added: ""At the heart of government [these issues] still aren't being taken seriously enough."" Tracey Crouch took maternity leave in 2016 All MPs are paid in full while on maternity, paternity or adoption leave. But not all their duties in Parliament are covered during their absence: Conservative MP Tracey Crouch,externalwas the first Conservative minister to take maternity leave in 2016.

Some MPs had complaints about the language in the bill - which used the word ""persons"" instead of ""women"" - saying it was ""adopting extreme gender ideology"". But Ms Mordaunt said it had merely been a ""drafting issue"" and the term ""women"" would be used in all its documents going forward. Women are entitled to up to 52 weeks' maternity leave They must take at least two weeks' leave after the baby is born (or four weeks if they work in a factory) They are eligible to be paid for six weeks at 90% of their average weekly earnings and 33 weeks at Â£151 per week or 90% of their average weekly earnings (if lower) Fathers can take two weeks' statutory paternity leave at up to Â£151 a week Some couples are also entitled to shared parental leave of up to 50 weeks and 37 weeks of pay Some employers give contractual maternity pay as a benefit, what is paid varies, but is more than Statutory Maternity Pay Others are eligible for Maternity Allowance, paid by the government, this is usually for people who've been employed or self-employed for 26 weeks in the 66 weeks before their due date Creasy on parental leave: Time for deeds not words.

"The go-ahead for the next phase of Britainâs controversial HS2 high-speed rail network has been approved. Phase 2A of the project will be built from the West Midlands to Crewe, and was given Royal Assent on Thursday. Supporters of HS2 say it will spur economic growth, help level up the country, and provide greener transport. But environmentalists say it will increase carbon emissions and canât be justified now people have embraced video conferencing such as Zoom. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said: ""Whatever your view of this project, HS2 is now a reality - heading north, creating jobs and building a brighter future for our country. ""This vital project is at the heart of the government's commitments to build back better from the pandemic, tackle the North-South divide and drive growth across the country. ""I look forward to seeing spades in the ground to get this section built and deliver the benefits of high-speed rail to the North as swiftly as possible."" But critics argue that the justification for building HS2 was ever-increasing rail passenger numbers. And the government now admits future passenger growth is unknowable. HS2 Minister Andrew Stephenson recently said: ""If the first reaction to the pandemic is to cancel major infrastructure projects committed to by successive governments now for more than a decadeâ¦ that would have a chilling impact on the construction sector in the UK and inward investment.â Caroline Davies, BBC transport correspondent A year since the prime minister announced that HS2 would be built, another phase has been given the go ahead. But this project still has more hurdles to go. While phase 2a was anticipated to be signed off, the rest of the proposed route - from Crewe to Manchester and the eastern leg, connecting Birmingham and Leeds - are both still in the works. Businesses and local politicians campaigning for these routes have called on the government to commit to the rest of the project to avoid an east-west divide in transport in the North. The project still has its critics, from environmental campaigners to those who argue new capacity isn't needed with new remote ways of working. Passenger services won't start on the first parts of the line until at least 2029, and arguments about the project aren't over yet. MPs voted overwhelmingly for the project, but some still question its value for money. Chesham and Amersham MP Dame Cheryl Gillan asked whether the cost could be justified when ministers âhave not established that the future use of public transport will be at a level that will make this railway viable in any way, shape or form?â Green MP Caroline Lucas called it a âvanity projectâ. She says travel patterns have been revolutionised during Covid, and won't return to previous levels. And she complained: âItâll take decades for the project to have even a chance of becoming carbon neutral because of the emissions from building the line. ""Meanwhile dozens of ancient woodlands are being put at risk or damaged â the very woodlands we should be protecting to help tackle climate change.â Green campaigners are still hiding out in tunnels under Euston station to make their protest against the schemeâs impact on the climate and wildlife. Court rejects protesters' bid to remain in tunnels HS2 tunnel activists in 'very dangerous' situation HS2 downgrade 'will short-change millions' Tony May, Emeritus Transport Professor at Leeds University, said: âEven on optimistic predictions HS2 takes 65 years from its completion  before its carbon saving (through low-carbon trains) has offset the carbon costs of construction. âSo up to 2050 (the critical deadline for achieving nearly zero emissions) HS2 is a carbon burden on the country. It doesn't save carbon at all.â The company says it is working on smarter designs to reduce the carbon impact of the materials it uses. The first phase of HS2 between London and the West Midlands is already well underway. There are 240 sites now active along the Phase One route. HS2 says it employs over 13,000 people with 400 apprenticeships, and tens of thousands more jobs supported through the supply chain. Campaigners have staged anti-HS2 protests in London and elsewhere. Passenger services are scheduled to start between stations at Londonâs Old Oak Common and Birmingham Curzon Street between 2029-33. Phase 2Aâs opening will coincide with the LondonâBirmingham route. HS2 A will carry six long-distance high speed services per hour. Sara Williams, chief executive of Staffordshire Chamber of Commerce, said: âExtending the high speed line northwards will generate thousands of contract opportunities for local businesses and provide a vital boost for the Staffordshire economy.â Critics say the government could have created far more jobs for the same amount of money by developing a labour-intensive national scheme to renovate leaky homes â an activity that would actively reduce carbon emissions.

"Jan after a flight at Duxford Aerodrome in September 2019, which she says would have been impossible before her four-stone weight loss A drug that suppresses appetite has led to some people losing more than a fifth of their body weight, a major international trial shows. A weekly injection of the drug, semaglutide, was given alongside advice on diet and fitness. The study, conducted on almost 2,000 people, showed an average 15kg weight loss during the 15-month trial. Scientists said the results could mark a ""new era"" in treating obesity with even more therapies on the horizon. Jan, from Kent, lost 28kg (four stone), equivalent to more than a fifth of her body weight. ""The drug changed my life and completely altered my approach to food,"" she said. She said dieting had made her ""miserable"" but taking the drug was completely different as she was less hungry. However, now Jan has come off the trial her appetite has returned and she is putting weight back on. She said: ""It felt effortless losing weight while on the trial, but now it has gone back to feeling like a constant battle with food."" Semaglutide will already be familiar to some people who use it as a treatment for type 2 diabetes, but this trial looked at giving it at higher doses. Tesco urged by investors to sell more healthy food The drug works by hijacking the body's appetite levels and mimicking a hormone - called GLP1 - that is released after eating a filling meal. The trial gave some people the drug and others a dummy injection, while both groups were given the lifestyle advice. The results, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, showed people lost an average of 15kg on semaglutide compared with 2.6kg without. However, 32% of people lost a fifth of their body weight with the drug, compared with fewer than 2% on the dummy treatment. Prof Rachel Batterham, from UCL and one of the UK researchers, told the BBC News website: ""This is a game-changer in the amount of weight loss it causes. ""I have spent the last 20 years doing obesity research, up until now we've not had an effective treatment for obesity apart from bariatric surgery."" She said losing weight would reduce the risk of heart disease, diabetes and of severe Covid-19. Semaglutide is being submitted to drugs regulators so cannot be routinely prescribed. However, Prof Batterham expects the drug would be used initially by specialist weight loss clinics rather than being widely available. There were side-effects to the treatment including nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, and constipation. And there are five-year studies taking place to see if weight loss can be sustained in the long term. Prof Sir Stephen O'Rahilly, from the University of Cambridge, said: ""The amount of weight loss achieved is greater than that seen with any licensed anti-obesity drug. ""This is the start of a new era for obesity drug development with the future direction being to achieve levels of weight loss comparable to semaglutide, while having fewer side-effects."" Dr Duane Mellor, a dietitian and from Aston Medical School, said: ""It is useful to have a potential option to help people lose weight, however we need to acknowledge that weight loss will still need lifestyle change, and that any medication or change in lifestyle can bring potential risks and side-effects. ""So, it is always wise to speak to a health professional before trying to lose weight.""

"Social media posts by Gina Carano, who plays Cara Dune on The Mandalorian, have been called ""abhorrent and unacceptable"" by Lucasfilm. In a statement, a spokesperson said: ""Gina Carano is not currently employed by Lucasfilm and there are no plans for her to be in the future."" The hashtag #FireGinaCarano trended on Twitter for hours following a story shared on her Instagram, that some branded anti-Semitic. It has since been deleted. In the post, the former MMA fighter compared ""hating someone for their political views"" in the US to the treatment of Jewish people leading up to the Holocaust in Nazi Germany. Millions of Jewish people and other minorities were killed at the hands of the Nazis during World War Two. Gina Carano starred alongside Pedro Pascal in Lucasfilm's first live-action series This isn't the first time the 38-year-old actress, who's played Cara Dune in the hit show on Disney Plus for two seasons, has been controversial on social media. Back in November Star Wars fanscalled for her to to be firedafter she put up several posts supporting Donald Trump. She openly questioned whether vote counting during the US presidential election was fair, something President Donald Trump had said repeatedly. The actor tweeted: ""We need to clean up the election process so we are not left feeling the way we do today. Put laws in place that protect us against voter fraud."" There hasnever been any evidenceto support President Trump's claims of voter fraud. She has also previously made fun of people who wear masks during the pandemic. Star Wars actor John Boyega at BLM protests in London Star Wars actor John Boyega, and Carano's Mandalorian co-stars Carl Weathers and Pedro Pascal have also posted about their own beliefs, whether it's support of Joe Biden or for the Black Lives Matter movement. Back in August Carano was asked to show her support for BLM. When she didn't post anything online, some on social media accused her of being racist. She responded saying: ""In my experience, screaming at someone that they are a racist when they are indeed NOT a racist & any post and/or research you do will show you those exact facts, then I'm sorry, these people are not 'educators.' They are cowards and bullies."" She's also been defended by some fans, saying she's a victim of ""cancel culture"". After the release of Lucasfilm's statement, some social media users launched a campaign to boycott Disney Plus, the streaming service which airs The Mandalorian. The hashtag #CancelDisneyPlus has also been trending. Variety is also reporting that Gina Carano has been dropped by her agent United Talent Agency.

"More than five million people have fallen into a ""fragile"" financial position owing to the coronavirus crisis, with young working adults among the hardest hit. People from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds were also more seriously affected than others, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said. The regulator said ""the pain is not being shared equally"". An estimated 14.2 million people are vulnerable to a financial shock. The regulator'sFinancial Lives survey,externalis a benchmark for the state of the nation's finances. A total of 16,000 people were interviewed in February last year, with another 22,000 spoken to in October, after the pandemic struck. As a result, it gives a snapshot of the first six months of restrictions caused by the coronavirus crisis. 'My spending has gone up, not down, in lockdown' The findings suggest that a quarter of the UK adult population now have low financial resilience. That means they have debts that are hard to manage, low savings, and are vulnerable to a financial shock such as a large, unexpected bill. The number of people who fell into that category rose by 5.1 million between February and October. Many people have cut back on essentials, around a fifth expect to borrow from family and friends, and one in 10 plan to use a food bank. ""While there are some positives in the data, many of the findings are worrying,"" said Nisha Arora, director of consumer and retail Policy at the FCA. ""The pain is not being shared equally with a higher than average proportion of younger and BAME adults becoming vulnerable since March.

Coronavirus prompted thousands of people to offer their services to help the NHS through the pandemic. And it inspired one mother and daughter to join nursing courses at the same university. Tracy Alexander, 49, chose to specialise in child nursing, while her daughter Sarah, 22, has pursued adult nursing - both at Liverpool John Moores University. They are both in their first year and began their studies in September. Sarah said it was ""nice to have someone who understands"" when she comes home after a day of lessons. This video can not be played Liverpool mum and daughter become nursing students together The closure of the hospitality sector during lockdown is having a knock-on effect on food producers. One - the Cornish Cheese Company - is warning that it has two tonnes of cheese at risk of being thrown away. Cornish Blue cheese takes about 10 weeks to mature and then has to be sold within six weeks. The firm usually sells 80% of its product to the hospitality sector and said the cheese would go off within two to three weeks. Ben Stansfield said: ""Normally we could sell this easily with all the wholesalers open, but it is all going to go off within two to three weeks. ""We are trying our best to not have to throw any away but we won't be able to sell it after that and you can't freeze two tonnes of cheese."" Find out morehere.

Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent Simon Ashley and his twin boys - Ralph and Henry With twin boys approaching the age of two, Simon Ashley and his wife Katie realised they needed more space at home and decided to take advantage of the stamp duty holiday to move to a bigger property. But, along with many thousands of people also planning to move during the pandemic, theynow face a race to beat the deadline at the end of March. ""The stamp duty holiday is a big thing for us. To put it bluntly, the impact is just over Â£12,000,"" said Simon, aged 34. ""It is making us nervous."" The tax concession in England and Northern Ireland means no stamp duty is paid on the first Â£500,000 of a property sale. In Scotland and Wales the equivalent levies have had breaks too but all are set to return to their pre-pandemic thresholds on 1 April.

Stormont ministers will take a ""collective approach"" when reviewing Northern Ireland's lockdown restrictions next week, finance minister Conor Murphy has said. NI re-entered lockdown on 26 December, with the measures due to last until 5 March. But ministers will meet on Thursday to review what should happen beyond that point. First Minister Arlene Foster said there needed to be one more ""push"" to reduce infection rates as much as possible. She said next Thursday's executive meeting would be a ""key decision point"" about how Northern Ireland emerges from lockdown. A pathway to recovery document is due to be published by the executive in the coming weeks, with many businesses asking for clarity around indicative reopening dates. Read more Sweden has been rolling out vaccines since December Coronavirus deaths appear to be declining in Sweden as more elderly people receive vaccinations against the disease, health officials say. Another 44 Covid-19 deaths were registered on Thursday, bringing the total to 12,370 in Sweden. But deaths have been steadily declining since December, when more than 100 a day were being recorded, World Health Organization data showed. âWe can in good conscience say that this type of decrease should be due to the vaccines,â chief epidemiologist Anders Tegnell said, adding: âIt also follows what we have seen in Israel and other countries.â Sweden has prioritised vaccinating people in nursing homes, where many of the countryâs deaths have occurred. The coronavirus death rate in Sweden is higher than that of its Nordic neighbours, but lower than some European countries that imposed tight restrictions. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The latest daily Covid figures for the UK show continued progress, with just under 13,500 new infections reported. It means week on week there has been a drop of approaching a third â and this compares to an average of nearly 60,000 infections a day at the start of the year. The number of new deaths confirmed is 678. Daily figures do jump around a little but the average for the past week is now well below 800 a day, compared with more than 1,200 a few weeks ago. Could vaccination be playing a role? At the moment, there is nothing to clearly suggest it is â or at least not in a significant way. The drop seems to be largely driven by lockdown. But in the coming weeks expect that to change. The falls â at least in terms of hospital cases and deaths â could soon become even more marked. Vitaliy ShevchenkoBBC Monitoring In a rare update on the progress of Russia's vaccination
campaign, an official has said that more than 1.7 million Russians have been
fully vaccinated against coronavirus. Denis
Logunov from the state-run Gamaleya Centre, which developed Russia's Sputnik V
vaccine, was speaking at a meeting organised by the ruling United Russia party
at the Moscow City Council. He said some 2.2 million residents of the country
had received the first of two jabs. Officials
have so far been tight-lipped about the exact number of Russians who have been
vaccinated, and Logunovâs data suggests that Russia is lagging far
behind in the race to vaccinate against Covid-19. According to figures,external, fewer than 1.5% of the population in Russia have
received anti-coronavirus shots, compared to 69.5% in Israel, 47.4% in the UAE,
20% in the UK, 13.4% in the US, 5.6% in Chile and 2.8% in China. The daily figures also show a total of 13,509,108 people have now received the first dose of a vaccine in the UK - a rise of 450,810 compared with yesterday. The data wastweeted,externalby Public Health England, rather than published on the government's coronavirus dashboard as it normally is. PHE said due to a technical difficulty, the dashboard was expected to be updated at 18:00 GMT. A further 678 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, according to the latest government figures, which weretweeted by Public Health England,external. It takes the death toll by that measure to 115,529. There were also a further 13,494 cases reported. On Wednesday, 1,001 deaths and 13,013 cases were reported.   Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor In normal times, you probably wouldn't think it's any business of a politician's to tell you when, or when not, to book a summer holiday. The pandemic, of course, has changed all that - you can look still, but you may well not want to book. Health Secretary Matt Hancockhas said it's ""too early"" to knowwhether summer holidays can go ahead. His comments came after both the PM and Grant Shapps pleaded with people not to ""go ahead and book holidays"". Ministers' remarks clash with each other - in emphasis or fact sometimes - because they just do not know exactly what the situation will be, so they have no solid decision to explain. And if they don't know, well there's not much they can tell us. Read more from Laura's bloghere.  Prisoners in England's jails have been locked in their cells for more than 90% of the day to keep them safe from Covid-19, the prisons watchdog says. And the extra restrictions, which began in March, have led to a decline in their mental and physical health and a rise in drug taking and self-harm. ""It's being imprisoned while you're in prison,"" one inmate told inspectors. Predictions up to 2,000 inmates would die in the pandemic in England and Wales without action have been avoided. But inspectors who visited a cross-section of jails, interviewing male and female prisoners as well as young offenders, found the long-term consequences of such an extended and restrictive regime could be ""profound"", with some newly-released offenders ill-prepared for life outside. Normally, adult prisoners should spend between eight and 10 hours a day outside their cells. Meanwhile, at HMP Bullingdon in Oxfordshire a 52-year-old inmate hasdied following an outbreak of the virus. Read more  Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst The clock has struck midnight (16:00 GMT) in China, ushering in the Lunar New Year. It is normally the happiest time of the year in China, when families gather to have meals and set off fireworks. But because of coronavirus outbreaks in the country's north-east, many people will be celebrating alone this year. A âunique but safeâ new year is how some state media outlets have been framing the occasion. On the bright side, it has been four days since China recorded a domestically transmitted case of the coronavirus. So, with China's vaccination programme well under way, there is a lot of optimism for the Year of the Ox. As for the Year of the Rat, state media outlets appear to be pleased to see the back of it. On its Weibo account, the Peopleâs Daily newspaper posted a cartoon of an ox chasing a rat carrying parcels, and a coronavirus, out of an apartment. Meanwhile, in a reminder of more normal times, the annual New Year countdown show - the Spring Festival gala - returned to being the large-scale spectacle audiences expect it to be. Celebrations - more scaled down than usual - were seen across China to mark to Lunar New Year We've been hearing today about how England'squarantine hotel launch has been going- its booking website was taken offline just after launch. The quarantine measure is one of a growing number aimed at stopping the spread of new, potentially more-resistant Covid strains from other countries. From Monday, UK residents and Irish nationals who have been in33 red-list countries,externalin the 10 days before travelling will have to quarantine in hotelsselected by the government,external- at a cost of Â£1,750. They can only enter the UK at five airports: Heathrow, Gatwick, London City, Birmingham and Farnborough Airfield. Despite all this, UK travel providers say they are stillseeing strong demand for summer getaways later in the year. There is more on UK travel ruleshere. Germany has banned arrivals from countries with outbreaks of highly transmissible coronavirus variants The German government will impose a ban on travel from the Czech Republic and the Austrian region of Tyrol, Interior Minister Horst Seehofer has told local media. ""The states of Bavaria and Saxony today asked the government to class Tyrol and the border regions of the Czech Republic as virus mutation areas, and to implement border controls,"" Seehofer told the SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung newspaper on Thursday. He said the border controls, which have been approved by Chancellor Angela Merkel, will come into force on Sunday. Germany in late January banned most travellers from countries with the highest numbers of new, more contagious coronavirus variants. Only a handful of exceptions are allowed to enter Germany from these countries, including returning nationals and essential workers. The UK, where a highly contagious variant of the virus was first detected last year, is subject to such a travel ban. There are fears that vaccines are not as effective against some coronavirus variants, such as the one found in South Africa.

"This video can not be played Hancock on holiday uncertainty: ""People are smarter than all that."" It is ""too early"" to know whether summer holidays can go ahead, the health secretary has said. Matt Hancock said there was still ""a lot of uncertainty"" but ministers were doing everything possible to make sure people could have a holiday this year. He told the BBC he had booked his own summer break in Cornwall ""months ago"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer urged the government to ""get rid of the mixed messages"" about whether people should book holidays for later in the year. Some Tory MPs and businesses also criticised the government for fuelling uncertainty for travel companies already struggling in the pandemic. It follows confusion after Transport Secretary Grant Shapps warned ""people shouldn't be booking holidays right now - not domestically or internationally"". Downing Street said Prime Minister Boris Johnson would unveil a roadmap for easing restrictions - potentially including travel - in the week beginning 22 February. Analysis by BBC political correspondent Jonathan Blake For most announcements from the government, a day here or there might not make much difference. But nobody wants to wait any longer than necessary for the promised ""roadmap"" to take England out of lockdown. So when the prime minister promised that ""on 22 February"" he would reveal that plan, Conservative MPs were among those marking their diaries. But now Downing Street has said the roadmap will come ""on the week of the 22nd"" - which isn't quite the same. In response, Tory backbenchers are warning the government not to ""backslide"" on its promise. They want to hold ministers to their aim of giving schools two weeks' notice before re-opening to all pupils on 8 March. A vocal minority of Conservative MPs have argued the current lockdown is too strict and needs to lift as soon as possible. Others have been more patient and kept faith the government will take the right decisions at the right time. But the further cases fall, the more people get the vaccine and the longer time goes on, the more pressure on the government will grow. Mr Hancock told BBC Breakfast it was too early to know which coronavirus restrictions may still be in place over the summer, but that he understood people wanted to make plans. ""People are yearning for certainty over whether they can have a summer holiday"", he said, but ""pandemics are difficult times and there is a lot of uncertainty"". ""We are doing everything that we possibly can to make sure that people can have a holiday this summer but the vaccine rollout is absolutely essential to that,"" he continued. The health secretary also said that, before summer holidays, the priority would be making sure people can see loved ones again - but it was too early to say when this might happen. Holiday bookings jump despite 'unclear rules' Don't book holiday yet, government warns Starmer: 10-year Covid jail terms 'empty threat' The latest government figures,externalshow a total of 13,509,108 people have now received the first dose of a vaccine in the UK - a rise of 450,810 from Wednesday. The UK also reported another 678 people had died within 28 days of a positive Covid test, along with a further 13,494 new daily cases. Sir Jeremy Farrar, a member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said cases needed to fall below 10,000 a day before the UK should consider easing lockdown measures, with transmission rates still ""incredibly high"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it ""doesn't make any sense"" to set out plans to ease restrictions with arbitrary dates in March or April, adding that ""the data has to drive us"". ""In 2020 we lifted restrictions too quickly... as a result the transmission went back up in this country,"" he said. Dawn Dillon, from Surrey, says her husband booked a holiday to Spain in June 2019 for the following year as her birthday present. They were able to move the trip, which cost Â£1,000 for accommodation and flights, from 2020 to June 2021. ""But what do we do now - will we lose our holiday?"" she asks. ""I know it's not a priority but it would be nice to have some clarity."" Dawn, who is 55 and asthmatic, says she had anticipated that she would have had a Covid vaccine, along with her husband, before the trip in June. ""But you don't know how advanced the vaccination process is in other countries,"" she adds. Mr Johnson told a Downing Street briefing on Wednesday that as far as holidays were concerned, people would have to be a ""little bit more patient"". The PM's official spokesman said Mr Johnson does not have a holiday planned but ""is obviously keen to have a break over the summer"". But Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth criticised ministers for not being clearer about what the public could plan for.

"  By Christopher Giles and Jack Goodman  “Police came forward with trucks. Protesters drew back. We were watching from the side of the road.” Burmese protester Mya Tha Toe Nwe describes the moment just before her sister was shot in the back of the head last week in Myanmar’s capital Nay Pyi Taw. By Christopher Giles and Jack Goodman “Police came forward with trucks. Protesters drew back. We were watching from the side of the road.” Burmese protester Mya Tha Toe Nwe describes the moment just before her sister was shot in the back of the head last week in Myanmar’s capital Nay Pyi Taw. This story was first published on 10 February and has been updated. Mya Thwe Thwe Khaing was taken to hospital in a critical condition, and 10 days later her family announced that she had died. She had turned 20 while in hospital. The young woman’s shooting has become a defining moment in Myanmar’s fight for democracy following the military coup on 1 February. Footage of the incident, and a photo that appears to show her bloodied and unconscious afterwards, have been widely shared on social media. Mya Thwe Thwe Khaing  Many Burmese online are outraged at the first protester to die since the start of the anti-coup demonstrations, and the UN has expressed concern at the actions taken by security forces. The army says that only rubber projectiles, not real bullets, were used during the protests and that the police are investigating. So what do we know about the woman in the video? What was she doing at the time she was shot, and were bullets fired at protesters? Looking at the photos and video shared on social media, and by speaking to forensics experts, we’ve examined the evidence around the shooting.

The army says that only rubber projectiles, not real bullets, were used during the protests and that the police are investigating. So what do we know about the woman in the video? What was she doing at the time she was shot, and were bullets fired at protesters? Looking at the photos and video shared on social media, and by speaking to forensics experts, we’ve examined the evidence around the shooting. A video of the shooting shared widely online shows a group of people taking cover by a bus shelter. In the group a woman is standing wearing a motorcycle helmet and a red top. Police equipped with riot shields and batons are visible on the nearby road.  As the security forces begin spraying water and moving forward, multiple gun shots can be heard on the video. Immediately afterwards, footage shows the woman in the red top, who had her back turned to the police, fall suddenly to the ground. Mya Thwe Thwe Khaing's sister Mya Tha Toe Nwe “As you can see it online, we were hidden in the back. When I heard the gunfire, I thought they were shooting upwards,” her sister told BBC Burmese. “That was when she was shot. I thought my sister fell down due to her anger. When people were calling for help and pulled off her helmet, I saw blood coming out of her head and realised that she was hit. Then the crowd took her away.” Taking the video of the shooting on its own, which is low-quality and from a limited angle, the location where the woman was shot isn’t immediately clear. But by cross-referencing visual clues from billboards and road signs with other footage from the day, it’s possible to precisely pinpoint the incident. Other footage we’ve looked at shows police moving down Taungnyo Road, being met by a mass of protesters on the road roughly in line with the bus shelter. The area in the footage is near Thapyaygone Market, which sells clothes, food and homeware. It’s also possible to estimate when the shooting took place - between 12:00 and 13:30 local time - from the angle of the shadows of structures in the footage.

Social media users have also shared images of a specific “Dunk” model of helmet made by a company called Index, on which they point out what appears to be a bullet hole. The hole is on the back left, just above the branding, matching the footage of the shooting. We showed the image to forensics expert Dr Kate Hewins, who says it’s possible the object penetrated the helmet shell, with the helmet material partially closing back into the hole after the object had passed through. The hole in the helmet A rubber projectile, she says, would not have been able to have that effect. “From the images provided, it is highly unlikely that a commercially available rubber bullet would penetrate this helmet as seen in the image.” The blood on the inside of the helmet in another image shared on social media lines up with the indentation on the outside, suggesting that the helmet was penetrated. The evidence available suggests that in this instance it was caused by a bullet, says Dr Hewins. “I don’t see how it could have come from anything else and it’s highly unlikely to have been a less lethal munition. “The manner in which she falls suggests a small arms ammunition shot to the head, rather than an impact/shock that would result from a non-lethal projectile.” There is nothing in the video that suggests the bullet ricocheted off another surface before striking the woman, though this cannot be ruled out. Rebounding off something would have reduced the velocity of the impact. “It appears to be a direct impact,” says Dr Hewins. An unnamed doctor who spoke to Reuters at the Nay Pyi Taw hospital, saida bullet had penetratedthe back of the injured woman's head.

An unnamed doctor who spoke to Reuters at the Nay Pyi Taw hospital, saida bullet had penetratedthe back of the injured woman's head. From the video of the shooting, the woman is facing away from the police lines, and the angle at which the bullet hit her helmet is roughly consistent with a shot being fired from the direction of the police lines. The incident sparked a social media manhunt, driven by the country’s young Facebook users. Much of the speculation and anger centred on a police officer pictured holding a sub-machine gun. The photo was taken by a Reuters photographer at the protest. However, we can’t be certain who the officer is, or whether he fired on protesters. Photos also show he was not the only armed officer at the protest. But social media users were determined to identify him. Not long after the shooting, the names of two men emerged, both accused by social media users of being the armed police officer in the photo. Family pictures from personal Facebook accounts were uploaded and shared thousands of times and “wanted” posters were created. One of the men named on social media said he’d been a victim of “fake news” and denied any involvement. The other man’s Facebook page is no longer online. A single photo of him on Instagram has now attracted thousands of furious comments. Even though the internet has been intermittent since the coup, protesters have become intensely active in sharing pro-democracy messages. The image and footage of the shooting has been shared alongside popular hashtags such as #WhatsHappeningInMyanmar and #Feb9Coup. The sharing of these images has prompted concern from international rights groups. Human Rights Watch said, on analysing the footage of the shooting, that they observed “no actions by Mya Thwe Thwe Khaing in the video that would suggest she was engaged in or threatening violent acts, or had anything in her hands”. The country’s security forces have a long history of using force to suppress protests. But Mya Tha Toe Nwe says she is determined to go on, and has a message for fellow protesters. She told journalists: “We ask all people to continue in this [movement against the regime] until we win.” Authors: Christopher Giles and Jack Goodman Additional reporting from the BBC's Burmese Service and UGC team Editors: Dan Isaacs and Hugo Williams Online production: Paul Kerley and James Percy Graphics: Lilly Huynh Images: Getty Images, Reuters, Google and social media Published 10 February 2021         ",Negative,4.416489e-13
"This video can not be played Covid: Vaccine supplies could see roll-out 'slowdown' Scotland's vaccination programme is likely to slow down later this month because of supply problems, the first minister has warned. Nicola Sturgeon said a ""temporary reduction"" in Pfizer's manufacturing capacity meant the country had received slightly lower stocks of the vaccine than expected. This means the number of vaccination appointments is likely to be reduced. But Ms Sturgeon said Scotland is still on track to hit its vaccine targets. And she said the country would be able to ""rapidly accelerate"" the vaccination programme again if supplies increase again. A further 63,178 people had their first dose of the vaccine on Wednesday - the highest in a single day so fardespite the bad weather- bringing the total in Scotland to 1,048,747. The figure for the UK as a whole stands at more than 13 million. How many people have been vaccinated in Scotland? Nearly a quarter (23%) of all adults in Scotland have had their first dose, including about 97% of over 80-year-olds, 87% of those aged between 75 and 79 and 54% of 70 to 74-year-olds. Ms Sturgeon said the figures meant that Scotland had given the first dose to 75,000 more people than than had originally been expected by this stage. And she said it gave ""real hope"" that the vaccine will soon start to have an impact on the number of people dying or becoming seriously ill with the virus. A record number of people were vaccinated on Wednesday despite many parts of the country seeing extreme weather conditions But she said the higher than expected take-up, alongside reduced supplies of the Pfizer jab and the need to preserve some stocks for second doses, meant that ""we may need to reduce the number of appointments that we schedule over the next few weeks"". The first minister added: ""This sort of issue is not unexpected, given the huge complexities that the vaccination programme throws up. ""Importantly, we remain on course to meet the key targets we have set out. ""And we still anticipate, subject to supply, that everyone over the age of 50 will have received their first dose by early May."" It was revealed last month that the UK was set to face short-term delays in delivery of the Pfizer jab as the pharmaceutical company upgraded its production capacity. Pfizer is upscaling production at its plant in Puurs, Belgium, in efforts to produce more doses than originally planned for 2021 - temporarily reducing deliveries to all European countries. The American firm said at the time that this would mean ""fewer doses will be available for European countries at the end of January and the beginning of February.""

She added: ""That will reduce our expected supply next week and the week after by about somewhere between 120,000 and 190,000 doses a week overall over the two vaccines."" But the UK government said it was ""confident of our vaccine supply"" and that it would be able to hit its target of vaccinating everyone in the top four priority groups by next Monday. The prime minister's official spokesman said: ""We are confident of supplies but we haven't commented on details of delivery schedules or movements of the vaccines."" And a spokeswoman from Northern Ireland's Department of Health said: ""We are not aware of any Pfizer supply issues and are continuing to work through the priority groups as planned."" Meanwhile, the deaths of a further 48 people in Scotland who had previously tested positive for the virus have been recorded in the past 24 hours, bringing the total by that measure to 6,599. However, only 4% of the tests carried out on Wednesday returned positive results - down from 4.8% the previous day. The R number - effectively the rate at which the virus is transmitted - continues to be below one. And the number of people in hospital wards with the virus has now fallen slightly below the peak from the first wave last year, with the number of patients in ICU units also gradually falling.

"New rules on importing from Europe come into force in April Scotland's food and drink industry is warning of price rises and potential shortages when new Brexit rules on imports come into force in April. The UK's departure from the European Union has already led to a forest of new paperwork for firms exporting to the continent. According to James Withers, of trade body Scotland Food and Drink, the impact has been ""horrendous"". He says the seafood sector alone was losing ""about a million pounds a day"". ""There's no sign of any improvement soon,"" Mr Withers says. ""In fact [there are] many signs things could get worse."" The UK government said it was working closely with businesses to make sure they could ""take advantage of the opportunities"" that leaving the European Union brings. It said businesses were adjusting well to the new trade rules, which are being phased in over the next few months, and it was offering extensive advice and support. Fishing taskforce to tackle Brexit export 'issues' Fishing firms protest over post-Brexit disruption Scottish exporters count cost of further EU delays When Great Britain finally left the single market on Hogmanay the EU insisted on the immediate introduction of controls on exports to the continent but the UK government opted to wait until 1 April to introduce similar checks on imports. Mr Withers says: ""Those checks, when they're put in place, could also make things slow, more expensive and a lot more complex for EU businesses who need to sell products into businesses here. ""And that's a big issue for supermarkets and will be a big issue for many food companies who get ingredients from Europe."" One of those companies is Charles Stamper Fruit and Veg in Edinburgh which sources much of its produce from Spain and the Netherlands. Louise Stamper's firm supplies fruit and veg to the hospitality industry, schools and nursing homes Managing director Louise Stamper says: ""One thing for certain is prices will go up. ""It's going to just become very expensive to go out for a meal."" Ms Stamper founded the firm 32 years ago with her husband, Charles. They normally supply fresh fruit, vegetables and other produce to the hospitality industry, schools and nursing homes. Like many businesses they saw a heavy impact last year due to the Covid-19 restrictions and lockdowns. Ms Stamper says the first lockdown in March last year saw them lose all but a handful of their customers. Switching to home deliveries helped but they didn't come close to making up for the lost trade. A year ago the firm employed 30 people. Now it has 15 staff. Making matters worse, Ms Stamper says imports are 20% more expensive than they were last winter, a rise which she attributes in part to Brexit-related border disruption. Mr Withers reckons that the enforced closure of hospitality, entertainment and tourism due to Covid cost food and drink firms Â£3bn in lost sales in 2020, in a sector worth Â£15bn annually to the country's economy, including Â£6bn of exports. Compared to the effects of the pandemic, Jim Cummiskey views the long-term impact of leaving the EU as nothing more than an irritation Jim Cummiskey, chief executive of food wholesaler Failte Group, says the impact of the pandemic has been massive. ""To sum up the hospitality industry in one word: horrendous,"" he says. The Glasgow giant is based beside a huge food market at Blochairn in the north of the city and has three arms: produce, food service and wholesale. ""We've paid off probably 17 staff,"" says Mr Cummiskey, glancing around at empty shelves in a vast refrigerated warehouse which he says would usually be crammed with fresh produce. ""People just seem to think you can switch the lights back on and everything's going to be back to normal. That's not going to happen in this industry. It's going to take years of recovery,"" he says. Compared to the effects of the pandemic Mr Cummiskey views the long-term impact of leaving the EU as nothing more than an irritation. Bad weather rather than Brexit is to blame for seasonal price rises on continental goods, he argues. ""The UK will diversify,"" insists Mr Cummiskey. ""We always have and we always will. So we'll store more Scottish product when it's in season and we'll store more UK product when it's in season."" Wilma Finlay and her husband run an organic dairy farm near Gatehouse of Fleet in Galloway Some businesses which export to the EU are not so relaxed. Wilma Finlay and her husband David run an organic dairy farm near Gatehouse of Fleet in Galloway, famous for its ice cream and visitor centre. When the nation was ordered to stay at home in March last year, and again this winter, tourism and ice cream sales to restaurants collapsed. The impact on turnover was ""massive"" says Ms Finlay, ""absolutely massive"". Ms Finlay's dairy farm has branched out into cheese Luckily the farm had recently branched out into the production of cheese with the creation of a company called The Ethical Dairy. ""Home delivery has just taken off,"" she explains. ""It went from 30 orders a week to 300 orders a week almost overnight."" That's nothing like enough to offset the farm's ice cream and tourism losses but if Scotland were still in the EU, says Ms Finlay, she would now be taking the cheese enterprise to the next stage by ramping up exports to the continent. The additional costs of Brexit have put paid to that ambition. They amount, she calculates, to Â£45 in time and paperwork on every Â£35 order. That's before she has even considered the cost of production or postage. ""It's just a non-starter,"" says Ms Finlay who describes the impact of Brexit as an ""annoyance"" and the pandemic as ""devastating"". Ms Finlay's dairy farm has customers in Northern Ireland which they now require EU paperwork to supply What really surprised the Finlays though was the realisation that the EU-mandated checks and paperwork would also apply to trade with Northern Ireland where they had developed a number of loyal customers. The reason lies in the deal formalising the UK's exit from the EU which allowed Northern Ireland to remain in the single market to prevent the potentially incendiary return of an Irish land border. Instead there is now an Irish Sea border: dividing the UK, outraging unionists and leading to shortages of some goods in Northern Ireland. ""We hadn't seen that [Brexit] would also close the route to Northern Ireland because we're actually physically nearer to Belfast than we are to Glasgow and Edinburgh,"" says Ms Finlay who says she was deeply disappointed to be forced to stop supplying her Northern Irish customers. The disruption of commerce is also have an effect on the constitutional debate. In the 2016 referendum Brexit was supported by majorities of voters in England and Wales - and therefore by the UK overall - but it was opposed by 62% of people who cast ballots in Scotland and 56% in Northern Ireland. Since then support for Scottish independence has risen, with more than 20 polls in a row indicating a majority in favour of Scotland going it alone, and there has also been renewed discussion about the possibility of a referendum - known as a border poll - on Irish reunification. For now though a more pressing concern for business is the effect of the new checks and charges on imports from the EU to Britain due to come into effect on 1 April and whether they will lead to the shortages in Northern Ireland being replicated elsewhere in the UK? James Withers says dealing with the EU will get more complex, slower and more expensive Mr Withers of Scotland Food and Drink is concerned. ""At the moment supply chains are pretty robust,"" he says. ""The big supermarkets know what they are doing but if the lessons of the first few weeks in trying to get products out of the country are replicated for products coming into the country, we could find a real challenge."" Fresh fruit and vegetables are particularly vulnerable, he warns, especially when they are out of season in Scotland. He says: ""What I do know is we sell Â£1.2bn of Scottish food into the European Union every year and that has got an awful lot more difficult, an awful lot more expensive and an awful lot slower.""

"Royal Mail is to keep on 10,000 of the 33,000 temporary workers it took on to help it through the Christmas period. The parcel service said it had its busiest-ever three months between October and December last year, delivering 496 million parcels. ""Our busiest day during the quarter saw 32% more parcels delivered than our busiest day during the first national lockdown in 2020,"" it said. But it apologised fordelivery delays over Christmas and the New Year. ""Given these record volumes, we recognise that at times our service during the period was not always as we would have wished,"" said Royal Mail chairman Keith Williams. ""But thanks to the efforts of our team, the retention of around 10,000 of the 33,000 flexible workers from the Christmas peak, and the introduction of new processes, we have been making encouraging progress."" The company delivered almost 12 million parcels on its busiest day of the year. Mr Williams thanked staff who he said ""have worked incredibly hard to deliver these exceptional volumes at a time when many units have experienced rising levels of Covid-19 related absences, including necessary self-isolation"". Can Royal Mail be turned around by its new boss? 'Landmark' Royal Mail deal ends two-year dispute Last month, Royal Mail agreed what unions called a ""landmark"" deal to settle a long-running two year dispute with workers over pay and conditions. ""With the dispute now over, bosses at Royal Mail will be focused on looking ahead and tackling the rising competition from online retail delivery contracts which have boomed during the pandemic,"" said Julie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor. Under the agreement, Royal Mail is able to prioritise investment in its fast-growing parcels division. In the three months to the end of December its parcels division saw volumes grow 31% and revenue climb 37%. Growth was driven by e-commerce and Black Friday and Christmas, as well as the introduction of tighter Covid-19 restrictions regionally across the UK, it said. Given the stronger-than-expected trading, Royal Mail said it now predicted group adjusted operating profit would be ""well in excess of Â£500m"" for the 2020-21 financial year. ""Royal Mail remains one of the largest couriers in the UK and has shown it's willing to innovate and reshape itself to meet the new demands of its customers,"" said Ms Palmer. But she warned that the next year is going to be crucial for the long-term stability of the company.

"This video can not be played Health Secretary Matt Hancock: 'We need to build a better, stronger NHS' The NHS in England is to be reformed so health and care services can work more closely together, the government says. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the planned restructure will mean a focus ""on the health of the population, not just the health of patients"". But Labour questioned the timing of the changes ""in the middle of the biggest public health crisis our NHS has ever faced"", saying staff were exhausted. Mr Hancock said there was ""no better time than now"". Afull White Paper,externalwas published on Thursday, setting out the proposed future legislation. ""The pandemic has made the changes in this White Paper more not less urgent,"" Mr Hancock told MPs. Year-long hospital waits for 225,000 in England Reforms planned for NHS in England Social care reform needed within a year - NHS boss The shake-up will see the law changed to reverse reforms of the NHS in England introduced under Prime Minister David Cameron in 2012. Ministers believe the changes will put the NHS in a better position to cope with an ageing population and a rise in people with complex health conditions. One-in-three patients admitted to hospital as an emergency has five or more health conditions, such as diabetes, obesity or asthma, up from one-in-10 a decade ago. Those working in the health service said many of the rules in place were time-consuming, frustrating and stressful. Announcing the changes to MPs, Mr Hancock said the new system would see the NHS and local councils take decisions about local health together. ""The new approach is based on the concept of population health,"" he said. Organisations called ""integrated care systems"" - which already exist in some parts of the country - will be set up in each part of England and be responsible for funding to support that area's health. ""They will provide not just for the treatments that are needed but support people to stay healthy in the first place,"" said Mr Hancock. Responding to criticism over the timing, Mr Hancock said the pandemic had ""brought home the importance of preventing ill health in the first place"". Nigel Edwards, of the Nuffield Trust think tank, said the changes would be a ""re-wiring behind the dashboard"" and should not be too noticeable to patients. While it was not a ""magic bullet"", it could help different parts of the system work more closely together, he added. The public will be rightly asking what difference these reforms make and why they are being introduced now in the middle of a pandemic. The concept predates Covid - councils and the NHS have been piloting these approaches to integrated care over the past few years. But, in many ways, the pandemic has speeded up the process. With more care being done out of hospital because of the pressures from Covid, community NHS and council care teams have been working ever more closely. There is much to recommend greater joined up working. The 21st century patient has multiple conditions. Take a 70-year-old with heart problem and dementia who lives alone. They will need input from a heart specialist, support from community nurses and maybe the company of a befriending service. The staff needed could come from three different organisations working and funded separately.  It creates bureaucracy and it is not hard to see how the quality of care suffers. The white paper is an attempt to re-wire the NHS. But those working for the NHS argue that is just one part of the solution - staffing and investment will also play a role. The proposals include scrapping the tendering rule, which sees providers and private companies compete to win contracts to run services. This rule made it complicated for councils and different parts of the NHS to set up joint teams and pool their budgets, with some having to set up separate bodies to bid for contracts. Instead, the NHS and councils will be left to run services and told to collaborate with each other to pool resources. It also gives the health secretary more control over NHS England and other national bodies, which had been given a large degree of autonomy under the 2012 changes. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said Labour had long argued for more integrated care, but raised questions over the timing. He also said the test of the reorganisation ""will be whether it brings waiting lists and times down, widens access especially for mental healthcare, drives up cancer survival rates and improves population health"". Mr Ashworth added that ""legislation alone of course is not the answer to integration. ""We need a long-term funded workforce plan. We've not got one. We need a sustainable social care plan. We were promised one on the steps of Downing Street. We still don't have one."" The UK's social care systemis under pressurewith past governments failing to reform or fund the council-run system properly. In their 2019 election manifesto, the Conservatives pledged to find a cross-party solution to reduce pressures on the sector and provide long-term funding. Mr Hancock told MPs the government was ""committed to the reform of adult social care and will bring forward proposals this year"". 11 charts on what's happened to the NHS Meanwhile, NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens said the reform will create a ""flexible can-do spirit"" across the health and care system. The White Paper will cite examples of good practice, such as a care team at the Royal Derby Hospital which sees nurses from the community, council care services and hospital staff working together to plan the discharge of patients. Chris Hopson, of NHS Providers, which represents NHS managers, said it would end ""an unnecessarily rigid NHS approach to procurement"". The Local Government Association welcomed the plans but said they did not provide the funding to put care services on a ""sustainable and long-term footing"".

"Transport Secretary Grant Shapps' call for people to stop making summer holiday plans has been branded ""puerile and nonsensical"" by a senior travel industry professional. ""We're talking about the end of May or June, which is a long way off,"" said Sue Ockwell of the Association of Independent Tour Operators (AITO). Mr Shapps said there was too much uncertainty because of Covid. But Ms Ockwell said booking breaks gave hope to holidaymakers and the industry. ""It's something for people to look forward to and to keep travel companies going,"" she told the BBC. Earlier, Mr Shapps told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Please don't go ahead and book holidays. I simply don't know the answer to the question of where we'll be up to this summer. ""It's too early to give that information. The best advice to people is: do nothing at this stage."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson later said it was ""just too early for people to be certain about what we'll be able to do this summer"". He added that he understood ""why people want to make plans now, but we're just going to have to be a little bit more patient"". Too soon to book holiday, minister warns Mr Shapps' comments have been seen by many in the travel sector as dealing a blow to hopes of a swift recovery for tourism. For Ms Ockwell, they are symptomatic of a government that has failed to listen to her and her colleagues. ""It's highly frustrating. The government doesn't compare notes with anyone in the travel industry,"" she said. ""They could save getting a lot of egg on their faces if they did."" AITO represents about 120 specialist and independent tour operators in the UK. Ms Ockwell said the industry understood ""the scale of the challenges"" facing the government over coronavirus, but added that tourism brought great benefits to the UK economy and was in need of sector-specific help. Can I book a holiday in the UK? ""Holidays bring in a lot of money, holidays employ a lot of people and they're good for us,"" she said. ""We just want to be allowed to trade. That's all we're asking,"" she added. ""We're not forcing people to make bookings. We want people to be allowed to make their own common-sense judgements."" Ryanair's Michael O'Leary is ""optimistic"" British people will be allowed to travel from May onwards Other travel industry figures have echoed Ms Ockwell's dismay. Brian Strutton, general secretary of pilots' union Balpa, said: ""Airlines are drowning but, rather than throwing us a life raft, the transport secretary has just thrown a bucket of cold water at us."" And trade organisation Abta said waiting until the UK's vaccination programme was completed before allowing people to travel abroad meant ""we'll lose another summer season to the pandemic"". Several big travel companies, including Tui and Ryanair, have said theyexpect to see a strong rebound in bookings this summer. Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary told the BBC he remained ""optimistic"" that British people would be allowed to travel from May onwards. ""Many companies will not see their way through next winter if we go through a second summer of no bookings,"" he added. Don't book holiday yet, government warns UK holidays: What are the rules?

"Prisoners in England's jails have been locked in their cells for more than 90% of the day to keep them safe from Covid-19, the prisons watchdog says. And the extra restrictions, which began in March, have led to a decline in their mental and physical health and a rise in drug taking and self-harm. ""It's being imprisoned while you're in prison,"" one inmate told inspectors. Predictions up to 2,000 inmates would die in the pandemic in England and Wales without action have been avoided. But inspectors who visited a cross-section of jails, interviewing male and female prisoners as well as young offenders, found the long-term consequences of such an extended and restrictive regime could be ""profound"", with some newly released offenders ill-prepared for life outside. Normally, adult prisoners should spend between eight and 10 hours a day outside their cells. But pandemic restrictions have meant the suspension of: family visits education classes intervention work Gyms have been closed. And prisoners must cram daily tasks, such as showers and exercise, into the short period they are allowed out of their cells. Prisoners told inspectors they felt like ""caged animals"" and passed their time rearranging their possessions or varying when they sat on their bed or a chair. The lack of interventions for prisoners approaching their release date has already had an impact, according to social-justice charity Nacro. Miriam Khan, a reducing-reoffending officer in a men's category-B prison in South Yorkshire, told BBC News she was already seeing the most vulnerable men reoffending and returning to jail. ""When I have asked them, 'What are you doing back?' it's because they are struggling massively with their mental health and not being able to access support. ""Because everything is over the phone, they don't have the skill set to do it. ""Even their probation appointments have to be pre-booked, so they don't see them as much anymore"". Inspectors also highlighted the issue of ""doubling up"", where two prisoners share a cell designed for one. In lockdown, prisoners have to eat their meals in cells that sometimes have unscreened or uncovered toilets. ""You can hate someone for no reason, can't you? Being in the cell with them every day,"" said one prisoner, who shared. Chief inspector of prisons Charlie Taylor said: ""Many months after the introduction of these restrictions, most adult prisoners were still locked in their cell for an average of 22.5 hours a day, seven days a week."" ""We have heard suggestions that the restrictions, and a subsequent reduction in recorded violent incidents, have made prisons safer. ""Clearly with so little time out of cell, prisoners had less opportunity to be violent or fight. ""But this was not the full picture according to those we interviewed. ""Prisoners said that violence, intimidation and bullying had not stopped but had instead taken other forms. ""The accrual of debt persisted. ""And some had turned to using drugs and other unhealthy coping strategies as a way of managing their isolation and boredom."" Separately, the governor of an adult men's jail, speaking anonymously, said prisons were ""at a point of absolute crisis"". ""The pressure has been relentless for months and months,"" the governor said. ""I simply do not know how staff and prisoners are coping. ""Morale is at rock bottom. ""And with increasing numbers of positive cases amongst prisoners and staff, and large numbers of staff having to self-isolate, it is increasingly difficult to ensure that even the basics get done. ""It is vital that prison staff are treated as a priority occupation for vaccination, as the current situation simply cannot continue."" One officer, also speaking anonymously, said there were currently 150 staff off sick or self-isolating at the high-security prison where he worked. Prisoners told the inspectors they had understood the need for the lockdown at the beginning of the pandemic. But the continued restrictions had led to ""despondency, resentment and lack of hope"". ""At the beginning, you could put up with it because you had the mental strength,"" one said. ""You wonder how much more you can actually tolerate."" Prisons and Probation Minister Lucy Frazer QC said: ""As this report recognises, the action we've taken and the hard work and dedication of front-line staff has significantly limited the spread of the virus, saved lives and protected the NHS. ""We know these necessary measures have come at a cost, so we continue to support prisoners with their well-being and rehabilitation through vital family contact, education, work and exercise. ""I will consider the report's findings carefully as we continue to work hard to protect the lives of staff and prisoners and cut crime."" LOCKDOWN RULES:What are they and when will they end?

Sir Jeremy Farrar, a member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said cases needed to fall below 10,000 a day before the UK should consider easing lockdown measures, with transmission rates still ""incredibly high"".

"New rules on importing from Europe come into force in April Scotland's food and drink industry is warning of price rises and potential shortages when new Brexit rules on imports come into force in April. The UK's departure from the European Union has already led to a forest of new paperwork for firms exporting to the continent. According to James Withers, of trade body Scotland Food and Drink, the impact has been ""horrendous"". He says the seafood sector alone was losing ""about a million pounds a day"". ""There's no sign of any improvement soon,"" Mr Withers says. ""In fact [there are] many signs things could get worse."" The UK government said it was working closely with businesses to make sure they could ""take advantage of the opportunities"" that leaving the European Union brings. It said businesses were adjusting well to the new trade rules, which are being phased in over the next few months, and it was offering extensive advice and support. Fishing taskforce to tackle Brexit export 'issues' Fishing firms protest over post-Brexit disruption Scottish exporters count cost of further EU delays When Great Britain finally left the single market on Hogmanay the EU insisted on the immediate introduction of controls on exports to the continent but the UK government opted to wait until 1 April to introduce similar checks on imports. Mr Withers says: ""Those checks, when they're put in place, could also make things slow, more expensive and a lot more complex for EU businesses who need to sell products into businesses here. ""And that's a big issue for supermarkets and will be a big issue for many food companies who get ingredients from Europe."" One of those companies is Charles Stamper Fruit and Veg in Edinburgh which sources much of its produce from Spain and the Netherlands. Louise Stamper's firm supplies fruit and veg to the hospitality industry, schools and nursing homes Managing director Louise Stamper says: ""One thing for certain is prices will go up. ""It's going to just become very expensive to go out for a meal."" Ms Stamper founded the firm 32 years ago with her husband, Charles. They normally supply fresh fruit, vegetables and other produce to the hospitality industry, schools and nursing homes. Like many businesses they saw a heavy impact last year due to the Covid-19 restrictions and lockdowns. Ms Stamper says the first lockdown in March last year saw them lose all but a handful of their customers. Switching to home deliveries helped but they didn't come close to making up for the lost trade. A year ago the firm employed 30 people. Now it has 15 staff. Making matters worse, Ms Stamper says imports are 20% more expensive than they were last winter, a rise which she attributes in part to Brexit-related border disruption. Mr Withers reckons that the enforced closure of hospitality, entertainment and tourism due to Covid cost food and drink firms Â£3bn in lost sales in 2020, in a sector worth Â£15bn annually to the country's economy, including Â£6bn of exports. Compared to the effects of the pandemic, Jim Cummiskey views the long-term impact of leaving the EU as nothing more than an irritation Jim Cummiskey, chief executive of food wholesaler Failte Group, says the impact of the pandemic has been massive. ""To sum up the hospitality industry in one word: horrendous,"" he says. The Glasgow giant is based beside a huge food market at Blochairn in the north of the city and has three arms: produce, food service and wholesale. ""We've paid off probably 17 staff,"" says Mr Cummiskey, glancing around at empty shelves in a vast refrigerated warehouse which he says would usually be crammed with fresh produce. ""People just seem to think you can switch the lights back on and everything's going to be back to normal. That's not going to happen in this industry. It's going to take years of recovery,"" he says. Compared to the effects of the pandemic Mr Cummiskey views the long-term impact of leaving the EU as nothing more than an irritation. Bad weather rather than Brexit is to blame for seasonal price rises on continental goods, he argues. ""The UK will diversify,"" insists Mr Cummiskey. ""We always have and we always will. So we'll store more Scottish product when it's in season and we'll store more UK product when it's in season."" Wilma Finlay and her husband run an organic dairy farm near Gatehouse of Fleet in Galloway Some businesses which export to the EU are not so relaxed. Wilma Finlay and her husband David run an organic dairy farm near Gatehouse of Fleet in Galloway, famous for its ice cream and visitor centre. When the nation was ordered to stay at home in March last year, and again this winter, tourism and ice cream sales to restaurants collapsed. The impact on turnover was ""massive"" says Ms Finlay, ""absolutely massive"". Ms Finlay's dairy farm has branched out into cheese Luckily the farm had recently branched out into the production of cheese with the creation of a company called The Ethical Dairy. ""Home delivery has just taken off,"" she explains. ""It went from 30 orders a week to 300 orders a week almost overnight."" That's nothing like enough to offset the farm's ice cream and tourism losses but if Scotland were still in the EU, says Ms Finlay, she would now be taking the cheese enterprise to the next stage by ramping up exports to the continent. The additional costs of Brexit have put paid to that ambition. They amount, she calculates, to Â£45 in time and paperwork on every Â£35 order. That's before she has even considered the cost of production or postage. ""It's just a non-starter,"" says Ms Finlay who describes the impact of Brexit as an ""annoyance"" and the pandemic as ""devastating"". Ms Finlay's dairy farm has customers in Northern Ireland which they now require EU paperwork to supply What really surprised the Finlays though was the realisation that the EU-mandated checks and paperwork would also apply to trade with Northern Ireland where they had developed a number of loyal customers. The reason lies in the deal formalising the UK's exit from the EU which allowed Northern Ireland to remain in the single market to prevent the potentially incendiary return of an Irish land border. Instead there is now an Irish Sea border: dividing the UK, outraging unionists and leading to shortages of some goods in Northern Ireland. ""We hadn't seen that [Brexit] would also close the route to Northern Ireland because we're actually physically nearer to Belfast than we are to Glasgow and Edinburgh,"" says Ms Finlay who says she was deeply disappointed to be forced to stop supplying her Northern Irish customers. The disruption of commerce is also have an effect on the constitutional debate. In the 2016 referendum Brexit was supported by majorities of voters in England and Wales - and therefore by the UK overall - but it was opposed by 62% of people who cast ballots in Scotland and 56% in Northern Ireland. Since then support for Scottish independence has risen, with more than 20 polls in a row indicating a majority in favour of Scotland going it alone, and there has also been renewed discussion about the possibility of a referendum - known as a border poll - on Irish reunification. For now though a more pressing concern for business is the effect of the new checks and charges on imports from the EU to Britain due to come into effect on 1 April and whether they will lead to the shortages in Northern Ireland being replicated elsewhere in the UK? James Withers says dealing with the EU will get more complex, slower and more expensive Mr Withers of Scotland Food and Drink is concerned. ""At the moment supply chains are pretty robust,"" he says. ""The big supermarkets know what they are doing but if the lessons of the first few weeks in trying to get products out of the country are replicated for products coming into the country, we could find a real challenge."" Fresh fruit and vegetables are particularly vulnerable, he warns, especially when they are out of season in Scotland. He says: ""What I do know is we sell Â£1.2bn of Scottish food into the European Union every year and that has got an awful lot more difficult, an awful lot more expensive and an awful lot slower.""

Coronavirus prompted thousands of people to offer their services to help the NHS through the pandemic. And it inspired one mother and daughter to join nursing courses at the same university. Tracy Alexander, 49, chose to specialise in child nursing, while her daughter Sarah, 22, has pursued adult nursing - both at Liverpool John Moores University. They are both in their first year and began their studies in September. Sarah said it was ""nice to have someone who understands"" when she comes home after a day of lessons. This video can not be played Liverpool mum and daughter become nursing students together The closure of the hospitality sector during lockdown is having a knock-on effect on food producers. One - the Cornish Cheese Company - is warning that it has two tonnes of cheese at risk of being thrown away. Cornish Blue cheese takes about 10 weeks to mature and then has to be sold within six weeks. The firm usually sells 80% of its product to the hospitality sector and said the cheese would go off within two to three weeks. Ben Stansfield said: ""Normally we could sell this easily with all the wholesalers open, but it is all going to go off within two to three weeks. ""We are trying our best to not have to throw any away but we won't be able to sell it after that and you can't freeze two tonnes of cheese."" Find out morehere. A mother who suffocated her disabled son is said to have reached her ""wits' end"" during lockdown last year. Dylan Freeman's body was found in Acton, west London, on 16 August. His mother Olga Freemanpleaded guilty at the Old Bailey to manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibilityand has been detained in hospital indefinitely. The judge said Dylan was ""an indirect victim of interruption to normal life caused by the Covid-19 pandemic."" Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb said it was a""rare and desperately sad"" case. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent Simon Ashley and his twin boys - Ralph and Henry With twin boys approaching the age of two, Simon Ashley and his wife Katie realised they needed more space at home and decided to take advantage of the stamp duty holiday to move to a bigger property. But, along with many thousands of people also planning to move during the pandemic, theynow face a race to beat the deadline at the end of March. ""The stamp duty holiday is a big thing for us. To put it bluntly, the impact is just over Â£12,000,"" said Simon, aged 34. ""It is making us nervous."" The tax concession in England and Northern Ireland means no stamp duty is paid on the first Â£500,000 of a property sale. In Scotland and Wales the equivalent levies have had breaks too but all are set to return to their pre-pandemic thresholds on 1 April. More than five million people have fallen into a ""fragile"" financial position owing to the coronavirus crisis, with young working adults among the hardest hit, the Financial Conduct Authority warns. ItsFinancial Lives survey,externalis a benchmark for the state of the nation's finance and it says people from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds were also more seriously affected than others. The regulator says ""the pain is not being shared equally"". It warns an estimated 14.2 million people are vulnerable to afinancial shock. Stormont ministers will take a ""collective approach"" when reviewing Northern Ireland's lockdown restrictions next week, finance minister Conor Murphy has said. NI re-entered lockdown on 26 December, with the measures due to last until 5 March. But ministers will meet on Thursday to review what should happen beyond that point. First Minister Arlene Foster said there needed to be one more ""push"" to reduce infection rates as much as possible. She said next Thursday's executive meeting would be a ""key decision point"" about how Northern Ireland emerges from lockdown. A pathway to recovery document is due to be published by the executive in the coming weeks, with many businesses asking for clarity around indicative reopening dates. Read more Sweden has been rolling out vaccines since December Coronavirus deaths appear to be declining in Sweden as more elderly people receive vaccinations against the disease, health officials say. Another 44 Covid-19 deaths were registered on Thursday, bringing the total to 12,370 in Sweden. But deaths have been steadily declining since December, when more than 100 a day were being recorded, World Health Organization data showed. âWe can in good conscience say that this type of decrease should be due to the vaccines,â chief epidemiologist Anders Tegnell said, adding: âIt also follows what we have seen in Israel and other countries.â Sweden has prioritised vaccinating people in nursing homes, where many of the countryâs deaths have occurred. The coronavirus death rate in Sweden is higher than that of its Nordic neighbours, but lower than some European countries that imposed tight restrictions. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The latest daily Covid figures for the UK show continued progress, with just under 13,500 new infections reported. It means week on week there has been a drop of approaching a third â and this compares to an average of nearly 60,000 infections a day at the start of the year. The number of new deaths confirmed is 678. Daily figures do jump around a little but the average for the past week is now well below 800 a day, compared with more than 1,200 a few weeks ago. Could vaccination be playing a role? At the moment, there is nothing to clearly suggest it is â or at least not in a significant way. The drop seems to be largely driven by lockdown. But in the coming weeks expect that to change. The falls â at least in terms of hospital cases and deaths â could soon become even more marked. Vitaliy ShevchenkoBBC Monitoring In a rare update on the progress of Russia's vaccination
campaign, an official has said that more than 1.7 million Russians have been
fully vaccinated against coronavirus. Denis
Logunov from the state-run Gamaleya Centre, which developed Russia's Sputnik V
vaccine, was speaking at a meeting organised by the ruling United Russia party
at the Moscow City Council. He said some 2.2 million residents of the country
had received the first of two jabs. Officials
have so far been tight-lipped about the exact number of Russians who have been
vaccinated, and Logunovâs data suggests that Russia is lagging far
behind in the race to vaccinate against Covid-19. According to figures,external, fewer than 1.5% of the population in Russia have
received anti-coronavirus shots, compared to 69.5% in Israel, 47.4% in the UAE,
20% in the UK, 13.4% in the US, 5.6% in Chile and 2.8% in China. The daily figures also show a total of 13,509,108 people have now received the first dose of a vaccine in the UK - a rise of 450,810 compared with yesterday. The data wastweeted,externalby Public Health England, rather than published on the government's coronavirus dashboard as it normally is. PHE said due to a technical difficulty, the dashboard was expected to be updated at 18:00 GMT. A further 678 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, according to the latest government figures, which weretweeted by Public Health England,external. It takes the death toll by that measure to 115,529. There were also a further 13,494 cases reported. On Wednesday, 1,001 deaths and 13,013 cases were reported.   Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor In normal times, you probably wouldn't think it's any business of a politician's to tell you when, or when not, to book a summer holiday. The pandemic, of course, has changed all that - you can look still, but you may well not want to book. Health Secretary Matt Hancockhas said it's ""too early"" to knowwhether summer holidays can go ahead. His comments came after both the PM and Grant Shapps pleaded with people not to ""go ahead and book holidays"". Ministers' remarks clash with each other - in emphasis or fact sometimes - because they just do not know exactly what the situation will be, so they have no solid decision to explain. And if they don't know, well there's not much they can tell us. Read more from Laura's bloghere.  Prisoners in England's jails have been locked in their cells for more than 90% of the day to keep them safe from Covid-19, the prisons watchdog says. And the extra restrictions, which began in March, have led to a decline in their mental and physical health and a rise in drug taking and self-harm. ""It's being imprisoned while you're in prison,"" one inmate told inspectors. Predictions up to 2,000 inmates would die in the pandemic in England and Wales without action have been avoided. But inspectors who visited a cross-section of jails, interviewing male and female prisoners as well as young offenders, found the long-term consequences of such an extended and restrictive regime could be ""profound"", with some newly-released offenders ill-prepared for life outside. Normally, adult prisoners should spend between eight and 10 hours a day outside their cells. Meanwhile, at HMP Bullingdon in Oxfordshire a 52-year-old inmate hasdied following an outbreak of the virus. Read more  Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst The clock has struck midnight (16:00 GMT) in China, ushering in the Lunar New Year. It is normally the happiest time of the year in China, when families gather to have meals and set off fireworks. But because of coronavirus outbreaks in the country's north-east, many people will be celebrating alone this year. A âunique but safeâ new year is how some state media outlets have been framing the occasion. On the bright side, it has been four days since China recorded a domestically transmitted case of the coronavirus. So, with China's vaccination programme well under way, there is a lot of optimism for the Year of the Ox. As for the Year of the Rat, state media outlets appear to be pleased to see the back of it. On its Weibo account, the Peopleâs Daily newspaper posted a cartoon of an ox chasing a rat carrying parcels, and a coronavirus, out of an apartment. Meanwhile, in a reminder of more normal times, the annual New Year countdown show - the Spring Festival gala - returned to being the large-scale spectacle audiences expect it to be. Celebrations - more scaled down than usual - were seen across China to mark to Lunar New Year We've been hearing today about how England'squarantine hotel launch has been going- its booking website was taken offline just after launch. The quarantine measure is one of a growing number aimed at stopping the spread of new, potentially more-resistant Covid strains from other countries. From Monday, UK residents and Irish nationals who have been in33 red-list countries,externalin the 10 days before travelling will have to quarantine in hotelsselected by the government,external- at a cost of Â£1,750. They can only enter the UK at five airports: Heathrow, Gatwick, London City, Birmingham and Farnborough Airfield. Despite all this, UK travel providers say they are stillseeing strong demand for summer getaways later in the year. There is more on UK travel ruleshere. Germany has banned arrivals from countries with outbreaks of highly transmissible coronavirus variants The German government will impose a ban on travel from the Czech Republic and the Austrian region of Tyrol, Interior Minister Horst Seehofer has told local media. ""The states of Bavaria and Saxony today asked the government to class Tyrol and the border regions of the Czech Republic as virus mutation areas, and to implement border controls,"" Seehofer told the SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung newspaper on Thursday. He said the border controls, which have been approved by Chancellor Angela Merkel, will come into force on Sunday. Germany in late January banned most travellers from countries with the highest numbers of new, more contagious coronavirus variants. Only a handful of exceptions are allowed to enter Germany from these countries, including returning nationals and essential workers. The UK, where a highly contagious variant of the virus was first detected last year, is subject to such a travel ban. There are fears that vaccines are not as effective against some coronavirus variants, such as the one found in South Africa. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent For most government announcements, a day here or there might not make much difference. But nobody wants to wait any longer than necessary for the promised ""roadmap"" to take England out of lockdown. So when the prime minister promised that ""on 22 February"" he would reveal that plan, Conservative MPs were among those marking their diaries. But now Downing Street has said the roadmap will come ""on the week of the 22nd"". In response Tory backbenchers are warning the government not to ""backslide"" on its promise. They want to hold ministers to their aim of giving schools two weeks' notice before re-opening to all pupils on 8 March. A vocal minority of Conservative MPs have argued the current lockdown is too strict and needs to lift as soon as possible. Others have been more patient, but the further cases fall, the more people get the vaccine and the longer time goes on, the more pressure on the government will grow. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Amsterdam ousted London as the largest financial trading centre in Europe last month as Brexit-related changes to finance rules came into force. About â¬9.2bn (Â£8.1bn) worth of shares were traded on Amsterdam exchanges each day, against â¬8.6bn in London. Following new Brexit rules, EU-based banks wanting to buy European shares currently cannot trade via London, meaning a loss of fees for City firms. Bank of England chief Andrew Bailey has warned the EU not to cut off London. On Wednesday, Mr Bailey said there were signs that the EU planned to cut the UK off from its financial markets. Following the new Brexit trading rules coming into effect, there are talks to harmonise rules over financial regulations - so-called equivalence Both sides are working towards a March deadline to agree an ""equivalence"" regime under which the UK and Europe would recognise the other's regulations. Number 10, said it remained ""open"" to discussions with the EU on the equivalence issue. ""Despite the fact that we've supplied all of the necessary paperwork and are one of the world's most preeminent financial centres, with a strong regulatory system, the EU still haven't granted us full equivalence."" ""This has meant that some EU shares that were previously traded on UK venues have moved to the EU venues on advice of the European regulator, but our position is fragmentation of share trading across financial centres is in no one's interest,"" it added. It's called invisible trade - but selling services abroad is something the UK excels in, particularly when it comes to banking. Financial services makes up about 7% of the UK's income in total, and about 40% of banking and investment's business abroad is with the EU. But its needs were largely invisible from the deal struck with the EU at the end of last year. The diversion of share trading is the first visible, if inevitable, sign of the impact. And that business may not return to London. Even if the UK government and Brussels can ultimately reach agreement that financial services can get more access to each others markets, on the basis the UK's standards can be deemed ""equivalent"" to the EU's, share dealing may not be part of that. The UK government hopes Brexit will enhance the City's dominance, with scope to deepen relationships with other financial centres. But that's a work in progress. The boss of one share exchange described a recently-struck deal that allows Swiss shares to be traded in London as being like a free kick in a football match rather than an equaliser: it doesn't compensate for what has been lost in loosening ties with Europe. Mr Bailey said the City wanted to reach an agreement on financial rules, but would not accept being ""dictated"" to by Brussels. He said EU demands had so far been unreasonable. ""I'm afraid a world in which the EU dictates and determines which rules and standards we have in the UK isn't going to work,"" the governor said in his annual Mansion House speech to the City, this year held virtually. ""Is the EU going to cut the UK off from itself? There are signs of an intention to do so at the moment but I think that would be a mistake,"" he added. ""We have to state the argument for global standards and markets and openness and if we all sign up to that then there's no need to go in that direction."" Brexit: Barclays urges UK to focus on US and Asia How will London change after Brexit? Brexit 'crunch time' for City of London Financial services - a key driver of the UK economy - were largely omitted from the last-minute Brexit trade deal agreed in December. The City generates about Â£135bn in business annually, with financial institutions earning big fees from trading stocks and shares. But London's financial centre has been cut off from EU markets since 1 January. But Brussels says it will not be rushed into decisions on granting access for UK financial firms, as it wants to see how far UK rules will diverge from its own. It follows fears the UK will adopt a low-regulation Singapore-style model that would undercut the EU. Mr Bailey said the EU was holding the UK to unrealistically high standards on the issue of divergence, saying it would in effect make the City a ""rule taker"". He added that while some UK rules would change post-Brexit, sudden deregulation was not on the cards. ""Let me be clear, none of this means that the UK should or will create a low-regulation, high-risk, anything-goes financial centre and system,"" he said. ""We have an overwhelming body of evidence that such an approach is not in our own interests, let alone anyone else's."" Despite the current situation, Mr Bailey said that London would ""undoubtedly continue as one of the world's leading if not the leading financial centre"". Last month Mr Bailey said up to 7,000 finance jobs had so far been relocated from London to rival centres in the EU - well down on predictions of as many as 50,000 losses.

"Royal Mail is to keep on 10,000 of the 33,000 temporary workers it took on to help it through the Christmas period. The parcel service said it had its busiest-ever three months between October and December last year, delivering 496 million parcels. ""Our busiest day during the quarter saw 32% more parcels delivered than our busiest day during the first national lockdown in 2020,"" it said. But it apologised fordelivery delays over Christmas and the New Year. ""Given these record volumes, we recognise that at times our service during the period was not always as we would have wished,"" said Royal Mail chairman Keith Williams. ""But thanks to the efforts of our team, the retention of around 10,000 of the 33,000 flexible workers from the Christmas peak, and the introduction of new processes, we have been making encouraging progress."" The company delivered almost 12 million parcels on its busiest day of the year. Mr Williams thanked staff who he said ""have worked incredibly hard to deliver these exceptional volumes at a time when many units have experienced rising levels of Covid-19 related absences, including necessary self-isolation"". Can Royal Mail be turned around by its new boss? 'Landmark' Royal Mail deal ends two-year dispute Last month, Royal Mail agreed what unions called a ""landmark"" deal to settle a long-running two year dispute with workers over pay and conditions. ""With the dispute now over, bosses at Royal Mail will be focused on looking ahead and tackling the rising competition from online retail delivery contracts which have boomed during the pandemic,"" said Julie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor. Under the agreement, Royal Mail is able to prioritise investment in its fast-growing parcels division. In the three months to the end of December its parcels division saw volumes grow 31% and revenue climb 37%. Growth was driven by e-commerce and Black Friday and Christmas, as well as the introduction of tighter Covid-19 restrictions regionally across the UK, it said. Given the stronger-than-expected trading, Royal Mail said it now predicted group adjusted operating profit would be ""well in excess of Â£500m"" for the 2020-21 financial year. ""Royal Mail remains one of the largest couriers in the UK and has shown it's willing to innovate and reshape itself to meet the new demands of its customers,"" said Ms Palmer. But she warned that the next year is going to be crucial for the long-term stability of the company.

"Anglesey saw a 16% increase in house prices in 2020, according to the Principality The average house price in Wales has gone over Â£200,000 for the first time, the country's biggest building society has said. The Principality said lockdown had encouraged a ""race for space"" with people buying larger properties with bigger gardens. Eighteen of the 22 council areas in Wales saw record prices in the last three months of 2020. But sales were down 21% over that period compared with the previous year. All council areas saw an increase in prices from 2019. The average price for a home in Wales is Â£209,723. The Principality'sHouse Price Index,externaldoes not take account of inflation over years so this is the ""nominal value"" rather than the ""real value"". Taking account of inflation, Wales was 7% below the record high from September 2007 but is the highest since July 2008 in real terms. Prices rose by 8.2% in 2020, the highest rate of increase in 15 years. But there are concerns that some people might find themselves unable to get on to the property ladder due to rising prices. Not all property types are increasing equally, with demand for detached houses higher than other homes and the price of flats ""languishing since April 2020"". The Principality index is based on sales figures from HM Land Registry. How house prices changed at the end of 2020 in Wales House price growth 'fastest for almost six years' Working from home leads to house price rises There were double digit increases in annual prices in Anglesey (16%), Conwy (14%), Monmouthshire (14%), Flintshire (13%) and Newport (12%). Bridgend, Ceredigion, Gwynedd and the Vale of Glamorgan were the only council areas that hadn't experienced peak prices but had still seen an increase from 2019. The Welsh Government removed land transaction tax from all property sales below Â£250,000 from July 2020 to March 2021, saving buyers almost Â£2,500 in tax per sale. Elfed Wyn Jones: ""When the rare opportunity comes up with something in our price range, it gets sold quite quickly"" Elfed Wyn Jones returned to live at his family's farm near Trawsfynydd, Gwynedd, last year after losing his job in Aberystwyth due to the pandemic. He and his girlfriend, Anwen Duncan, would like to buy their own family home nearby with at least two bedrooms and they could afford a mortgage of up to Â£110,000, but he often sees places selling for in excess of Â£200,000. ""When the rare opportunity comes up with something in our price range, it gets sold quite quickly,"" he said. He suggested a cap on the number of holiday lets in areas to stop them from ""driving up prices"". ""I know of about seven or eight of the couples in Trawsfynydd who'd love to buy a house and start a family but, again, the houses that are in their price range and my price range tend to sell like hot cakes,"" he said. ""It's quite heart-breaking really."" Estate agent Dafydd Hardy said buyers are looking to ""change lifestyle"" North Wales estate agent Dafydd Hardy said business had been ""good"" over the last year which he had not expected due to the pandemic. He said buyers have been looking to ""change lifestyle"" such as up-sizing. ""They've focused on their needs really, and that's what has created the market,"" he added. He said thecurrent lockdown measureshad hit the market, with house sales down about 40% locally compared to last year. ""But we are expecting that the market will take off again."" HORIZONS TOUR OF WALES:Visit some of Wales' most beloved independent venues MAKE A DIFFERENCE :Donate a laptop to pupils across Wales Tom Denman, chief financial officer at Principality Building Society, said: ""The strength of the housing recovery in the second half of 2020 is striking, and this reflects both the stimulus provided by the Welsh Government in terms of the time-limited land transaction tax holiday, the pent-up demand which built up during the first lockdown, and the race for space to buy bigger properties with larger gardens. ""This increased demand has been driven by increased savings in many households during the lockdowns coupled with continued historic low mortgage rates. ""There has probably been some additional demand from buyers across the border with England, with house prices more affordable in Wales in relative terms,"" he added. House prices across the UKrose by 6.5% last year, according to Nationwide. But the Halifax suggested there had been adrop in prices UK-wide between December and January,external. ""On a range of metrics - buyer inquiries, instructions to sell, agreed sales, activity per surveyor and sales to stock ratio, Wales was equal to, or outperformed, the most active of English regions,"" the House Price Index concluded.

"New rules on importing from Europe come into force in April Scotland's food and drink industry is warning of price rises and potential shortages when new Brexit rules on imports come into force in April. The UK's departure from the European Union has already led to a forest of new paperwork for firms exporting to the continent. According to James Withers, of trade body Scotland Food and Drink, the impact has been ""horrendous"". He says the seafood sector alone was losing ""about a million pounds a day"". ""There's no sign of any improvement soon,"" Mr Withers says. ""In fact [there are] many signs things could get worse."" The UK government said it was working closely with businesses to make sure they could ""take advantage of the opportunities"" that leaving the European Union brings. It said businesses were adjusting well to the new trade rules, which are being phased in over the next few months, and it was offering extensive advice and support. Fishing taskforce to tackle Brexit export 'issues' Fishing firms protest over post-Brexit disruption Scottish exporters count cost of further EU delays When Great Britain finally left the single market on Hogmanay the EU insisted on the immediate introduction of controls on exports to the continent but the UK government opted to wait until 1 April to introduce similar checks on imports. Mr Withers says: ""Those checks, when they're put in place, could also make things slow, more expensive and a lot more complex for EU businesses who need to sell products into businesses here. ""And that's a big issue for supermarkets and will be a big issue for many food companies who get ingredients from Europe."" One of those companies is Charles Stamper Fruit and Veg in Edinburgh which sources much of its produce from Spain and the Netherlands. Louise Stamper's firm supplies fruit and veg to the hospitality industry, schools and nursing homes Managing director Louise Stamper says: ""One thing for certain is prices will go up. ""It's going to just become very expensive to go out for a meal."" Ms Stamper founded the firm 32 years ago with her husband, Charles. They normally supply fresh fruit, vegetables and other produce to the hospitality industry, schools and nursing homes. Like many businesses they saw a heavy impact last year due to the Covid-19 restrictions and lockdowns. Ms Stamper says the first lockdown in March last year saw them lose all but a handful of their customers. Switching to home deliveries helped but they didn't come close to making up for the lost trade. A year ago the firm employed 30 people. Now it has 15 staff. Making matters worse, Ms Stamper says imports are 20% more expensive than they were last winter, a rise which she attributes in part to Brexit-related border disruption. Mr Withers reckons that the enforced closure of hospitality, entertainment and tourism due to Covid cost food and drink firms Â£3bn in lost sales in 2020, in a sector worth Â£15bn annually to the country's economy, including Â£6bn of exports. Compared to the effects of the pandemic, Jim Cummiskey views the long-term impact of leaving the EU as nothing more than an irritation Jim Cummiskey, chief executive of food wholesaler Failte Group, says the impact of the pandemic has been massive. ""To sum up the hospitality industry in one word: horrendous,"" he says. The Glasgow giant is based beside a huge food market at Blochairn in the north of the city and has three arms: produce, food service and wholesale. ""We've paid off probably 17 staff,"" says Mr Cummiskey, glancing around at empty shelves in a vast refrigerated warehouse which he says would usually be crammed with fresh produce. ""People just seem to think you can switch the lights back on and everything's going to be back to normal. That's not going to happen in this industry. It's going to take years of recovery,"" he says. Compared to the effects of the pandemic Mr Cummiskey views the long-term impact of leaving the EU as nothing more than an irritation. Bad weather rather than Brexit is to blame for seasonal price rises on continental goods, he argues. ""The UK will diversify,"" insists Mr Cummiskey. ""We always have and we always will. So we'll store more Scottish product when it's in season and we'll store more UK product when it's in season."" Wilma Finlay and her husband run an organic dairy farm near Gatehouse of Fleet in Galloway Some businesses which export to the EU are not so relaxed. Wilma Finlay and her husband David run an organic dairy farm near Gatehouse of Fleet in Galloway, famous for its ice cream and visitor centre. When the nation was ordered to stay at home in March last year, and again this winter, tourism and ice cream sales to restaurants collapsed. The impact on turnover was ""massive"" says Ms Finlay, ""absolutely massive"". Ms Finlay's dairy farm has branched out into cheese Luckily the farm had recently branched out into the production of cheese with the creation of a company called The Ethical Dairy. ""Home delivery has just taken off,"" she explains. ""It went from 30 orders a week to 300 orders a week almost overnight."" That's nothing like enough to offset the farm's ice cream and tourism losses but if Scotland were still in the EU, says Ms Finlay, she would now be taking the cheese enterprise to the next stage by ramping up exports to the continent. The additional costs of Brexit have put paid to that ambition. They amount, she calculates, to Â£45 in time and paperwork on every Â£35 order. That's before she has even considered the cost of production or postage. ""It's just a non-starter,"" says Ms Finlay who describes the impact of Brexit as an ""annoyance"" and the pandemic as ""devastating"". Ms Finlay's dairy farm has customers in Northern Ireland which they now require EU paperwork to supply What really surprised the Finlays though was the realisation that the EU-mandated checks and paperwork would also apply to trade with Northern Ireland where they had developed a number of loyal customers. The reason lies in the deal formalising the UK's exit from the EU which allowed Northern Ireland to remain in the single market to prevent the potentially incendiary return of an Irish land border. Instead there is now an Irish Sea border: dividing the UK, outraging unionists and leading to shortages of some goods in Northern Ireland. ""We hadn't seen that [Brexit] would also close the route to Northern Ireland because we're actually physically nearer to Belfast than we are to Glasgow and Edinburgh,"" says Ms Finlay who says she was deeply disappointed to be forced to stop supplying her Northern Irish customers. The disruption of commerce is also have an effect on the constitutional debate. In the 2016 referendum Brexit was supported by majorities of voters in England and Wales - and therefore by the UK overall - but it was opposed by 62% of people who cast ballots in Scotland and 56% in Northern Ireland. Since then support for Scottish independence has risen, with more than 20 polls in a row indicating a majority in favour of Scotland going it alone, and there has also been renewed discussion about the possibility of a referendum - known as a border poll - on Irish reunification. For now though a more pressing concern for business is the effect of the new checks and charges on imports from the EU to Britain due to come into effect on 1 April and whether they will lead to the shortages in Northern Ireland being replicated elsewhere in the UK? James Withers says dealing with the EU will get more complex, slower and more expensive Mr Withers of Scotland Food and Drink is concerned. ""At the moment supply chains are pretty robust,"" he says. ""The big supermarkets know what they are doing but if the lessons of the first few weeks in trying to get products out of the country are replicated for products coming into the country, we could find a real challenge."" Fresh fruit and vegetables are particularly vulnerable, he warns, especially when they are out of season in Scotland. He says: ""What I do know is we sell Â£1.2bn of Scottish food into the European Union every year and that has got an awful lot more difficult, an awful lot more expensive and an awful lot slower.""

"This video can not be played Health Secretary Matt Hancock: 'We need to build a better, stronger NHS' The NHS in England is to be reformed so health and care services can work more closely together, the government says. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the planned restructure will mean a focus ""on the health of the population, not just the health of patients"". But Labour questioned the timing of the changes ""in the middle of the biggest public health crisis our NHS has ever faced"", saying staff were exhausted. Mr Hancock said there was ""no better time than now"". Afull White Paper,externalwas published on Thursday, setting out the proposed future legislation. ""The pandemic has made the changes in this White Paper more not less urgent,"" Mr Hancock told MPs. Year-long hospital waits for 225,000 in England Reforms planned for NHS in England Social care reform needed within a year - NHS boss The shake-up will see the law changed to reverse reforms of the NHS in England introduced under Prime Minister David Cameron in 2012. Ministers believe the changes will put the NHS in a better position to cope with an ageing population and a rise in people with complex health conditions. One-in-three patients admitted to hospital as an emergency has five or more health conditions, such as diabetes, obesity or asthma, up from one-in-10 a decade ago. Those working in the health service said many of the rules in place were time-consuming, frustrating and stressful. Announcing the changes to MPs, Mr Hancock said the new system would see the NHS and local councils take decisions about local health together. ""The new approach is based on the concept of population health,"" he said. Organisations called ""integrated care systems"" - which already exist in some parts of the country - will be set up in each part of England and be responsible for funding to support that area's health. ""They will provide not just for the treatments that are needed but support people to stay healthy in the first place,"" said Mr Hancock. Responding to criticism over the timing, Mr Hancock said the pandemic had ""brought home the importance of preventing ill health in the first place"". Nigel Edwards, of the Nuffield Trust think tank, said the changes would be a ""re-wiring behind the dashboard"" and should not be too noticeable to patients. While it was not a ""magic bullet"", it could help different parts of the system work more closely together, he added. The public will be rightly asking what difference these reforms make and why they are being introduced now in the middle of a pandemic. The concept predates Covid - councils and the NHS have been piloting these approaches to integrated care over the past few years. But, in many ways, the pandemic has speeded up the process. With more care being done out of hospital because of the pressures from Covid, community NHS and council care teams have been working ever more closely. There is much to recommend greater joined up working. The 21st century patient has multiple conditions. Take a 70-year-old with heart problem and dementia who lives alone. They will need input from a heart specialist, support from community nurses and maybe the company of a befriending service. The staff needed could come from three different organisations working and funded separately.  It creates bureaucracy and it is not hard to see how the quality of care suffers. The white paper is an attempt to re-wire the NHS. But those working for the NHS argue that is just one part of the solution - staffing and investment will also play a role. The proposals include scrapping the tendering rule, which sees providers and private companies compete to win contracts to run services. This rule made it complicated for councils and different parts of the NHS to set up joint teams and pool their budgets, with some having to set up separate bodies to bid for contracts. Instead, the NHS and councils will be left to run services and told to collaborate with each other to pool resources. It also gives the health secretary more control over NHS England and other national bodies, which had been given a large degree of autonomy under the 2012 changes. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said Labour had long argued for more integrated care, but raised questions over the timing. He also said the test of the reorganisation ""will be whether it brings waiting lists and times down, widens access especially for mental healthcare, drives up cancer survival rates and improves population health"". Mr Ashworth added that ""legislation alone of course is not the answer to integration. ""We need a long-term funded workforce plan. We've not got one. We need a sustainable social care plan. We were promised one on the steps of Downing Street. We still don't have one."" The UK's social care systemis under pressurewith past governments failing to reform or fund the council-run system properly. In their 2019 election manifesto, the Conservatives pledged to find a cross-party solution to reduce pressures on the sector and provide long-term funding. Mr Hancock told MPs the government was ""committed to the reform of adult social care and will bring forward proposals this year"". 11 charts on what's happened to the NHS Meanwhile, NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens said the reform will create a ""flexible can-do spirit"" across the health and care system. The White Paper will cite examples of good practice, such as a care team at the Royal Derby Hospital which sees nurses from the community, council care services and hospital staff working together to plan the discharge of patients. Chris Hopson, of NHS Providers, which represents NHS managers, said it would end ""an unnecessarily rigid NHS approach to procurement"". The Local Government Association welcomed the plans but said they did not provide the funding to put care services on a ""sustainable and long-term footing"".

"The NHS faces a number of challenges and often tops the list of concerns voiced by the public, but what state is it actually in? Last year more than Â£156bn was spent on health across the UK - about 12 times the figure that was spent 70 years ago. And that's after you adjust it for inflation. It means today about 30p out of every Â£1 spent on public services goes on health. Ever since the early 1950s the budget has been increasing, but the scale of those rises has varied quite considerably. The average rise has been just over 4%. The biggest rises were seen under the Labour governments between 1997 and 2010 when the average annual rise was about 6%. This dropped to 1% under the post-financial crisis coalition government between 2010 and 2015 - a figure which then rose under the majority Conservative government of recent years. The Conservatives have said their five-year funding plan for the NHS will see the budget rise by an average of 3.4% a year above inflation. It means that by 2023-24 there would be Â£149bn of funding available. By comparison, during the 2019 General Election, Labour proposed increasing it by 3.9% - bringing the budget to Â£155bn by 2023-24. The Lib Dems were marginally behind this coming in at Â£154bn. Spot the difference on the NHS Reality Check: Is the NHS boost Â£84bn or Â£20bn? Labour often talk about the risk of privatisation of the NHS, accusing the Conservatives of wanting to do a deal with US President Donald Trump. Private firms are already involved in providing NHS care. Just over 7% of the budget goes on private providers, up from just over 5% in 2011-12. These can be deals to run a specific service or to take on some NHS patients for routine treatments like hip and knee replacements. But it still leaves the overwhelming majority of care provided by the state and state-employed staff. Actually, GPs are technically independent small businesses contracted to provide a service to the NHS - but they tend not to be considered as private providers. Reality Check: How much does the NHS spend on the private sector? NHS money also goes to the private sector to purchase drugs and equipment. Nearly all of this is bought centrally so the NHS can use its bargaining power to negotiate good deals. A recent example of this was the agreement reached with Vertex to fund its cystic fibrosis treatments. The NHS got a significant saving on the price the drug manufacturer originally wanted. Fears have been raised that US firms would want the NHS to agree more lucrative deals - they get more money for their drugs in their own country.  But given the cost to the NHS of such a concession many doubt this is likely. There are three key targets for hospitals: covering A&E, cancer care and routine operations, such as knee and hip replacements. All parts of the UK have been struggling to hit them. The way they are measured differs between the UK nations. The A&E target is the most directly comparable - in that each nation expects 95% of patients to be treated or admitted in four hours. Performance is worse in Wales and Northern Ireland than it is in England and Scotland. Scotland is the last nation to have hit the target - back in the summer of 2017. Meanwhile, in cancer care patients are meant to start treatment within 62 days of an urgent GP referral. But that too is being missed, while waiting lists for routine treatments are rising. In England it has topped 4.4 million - the highest on record. Some 15% have waited more than the target time of 18 weeks. The ageing population is certainly a major factor for the growing pressures - and it is one with which all health systems in the world are struggling. Medical advances have meant that people are living longer. When the NHS was created, life expectancy was 13 years shorter than it is now. This is something to celebrate. Infectious diseases are no longer a significant threat. Heart attacksdo not claim the lives of people earlyin the same numbers. Evencancer is not the death sentence it once was- half of peoplenow survive for a decade or more. 'I won't let my chronic illness trap me in loneliness' What do the people of the world die from? But this progress has come at a cost. People are living with a growing number of long-term chronic conditions - diabetes, heart disease and dementia. These are more about care than cure - what patients usually need is support. That level of ill-health means the average 65-year-old costs the NHS 2.5 times more than the average 30-year-old. A 90-year-old costs more than seven times as much. As the number of older people continues to rise so will the cost to the NHS. This is compounded by other factors, including the rising cost of new drugs and high levels of obesity. A third of adults are so overweight they are risking their health significantly. Colluding drug firms 'cost NHS millions' UK most obese nation in Western Europe All this contributes to what health economists call health inflation - the idea that the cost of providing care outstrips the normal rise in the cost of living across the economy. This is why health has tended to receive more generous rises than other areas of government spending. But despite this the UK has been left trailing some other parts of Europe when it comes to spending as a proportion of GDP, which is a measure of the size of the economy. It is a gap that has widened since the previous Labour government was in power from 1997 to 2010. The result, as you would expect, is fewer beds, doctors and nurses per patient in the UK than the big spenders, which tend to tax people more. Germany, for example,has almost twice as many nurses per capita,externalthan the UK. But the lack of staff in the NHS is not just because of less spending, the health service cannot even fill the posts for which it has got funding. The NHS in Englandhas nearly 100,000 jobs unfilled at the moment,external. The total represents one in 12 of all the posts in the health service and would be enough to staff 10 large hospitals. It includes about 40,000 nurse posts and nearly 10,000 doctor vacancies. Some of the gaps are filled using overtime and agency staff, but some simply go unfilled. There are various initiatives in place to recruit and retain staff. And the number of training places for doctors and nurses are increasing. While the government has been able to put more money into the NHS, one element of the budget that has been cut is the money set aside for capital projects. That covers the cost of infrastructure, such as building works and IT. In recent years that has resulted in a growing maintenance backlog with hospitals having to contend with leaky roofs, out-of-date equipment and crumbling buildings. NHS claims fact-checked Government plans billions for hospital projects The capital budget increased by Â£1bn for 2019-20, bringing the budget up to Â£7bn. The NHS is also under pressure because of the problems in the social care system. Social care includes day centres, help in the home for tasks such as washing and dressing, and good quality care in care homes during the final years of life. It is seen as essential to keep people well and living independently - and out of hospital. The system is means-tested in England, which means only the poorest receive help from councils towards the cost of care. But even then it is heavily rationed. The result is growing numbers of older people going without care. According to Age UK, 1.4 million people over the age of 65 are not getting the care they need. That represents one in seven of all older people and is a rise of nearly a fifth in two years. This lack of care in the community has been directly linked to the growing pressures on hospitals by the Care Quality Commission, the body responsible for regulating standards across health and social care. Where in England does care cost the most? The crisis in care Does free personal care solve the crisis? Hunt: Care cuts went 'too far' The regulator believes that without reform of the system, the extra money being put into the NHS could be swallowed up without a noticeable improvement in performance. The other parts of the UK can make a case for being more generous in this respect - home care is capped in Wales and free for the over-75s in Northern Ireland, while Scotland provides free personal care (washing and dressing) in both care homes and people's own homes. Despite the challenges being faced by the NHS, the majority of the public say they are satisfied with services. The British Social Attitudes poll of nearly 3,000 people found 53% of people in England, Scotland and Wales were satisfied with services in 2018. But levels of satisfaction are falling. The latest score was athree percentage point drop since 2017and the lowest level since 2007. A peak of 70% was seen in 2010. Experts say waiting times and a lack of staff were major concerns as ratings for GPs dropped to an all-time low. Reality Check: Is the NHS boost Â£84bn or Â£20bn?

"This video can not be played Sir Simon Stevens: ""We do not have a fair and properly resourced adult social care system"" Plans to adequately fund the social care sector need to be in place within a year, the head of NHS England has said. Sir Simon Stevens told the BBC the Covid-19 crisis had shone a ""very harsh spotlight"" on the ""resilience"" of the care system. He said there was a need to ""decisively answer"" how high quality care could be provided long-term. The Department of Health said it would bring forward a plan for reform. In their 2019 election manifesto, the Conservatives pledged to find a cross-party solution to reduce pressures on the sector and provide long-term funding. 10 charts that show whatâs gone wrong with social care What are the problems with the social care system? Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr programme, Sir Simon said the Covid-19 pandemic should be used to give momentum to plans to overhaul how the system works. ""If any good is to come from this, we must use this as a moment to resolve once and for all to actually properly resource and reform the way in which social care works in this country,"" he said. ""The reality is that after at least two decades of talking about it, we do not have a fair and properly resourced adult social care system with a proper set of workforce supports."" He added: ""I would hope by the time we are sitting down this time next year on the 73rd birthday of the NHS that we have actually, as a country, been able to decisively answer the question of how are we going to fund and provide high-quality social care for my parents' generation. ""If you take back the history coming out of the Second World War, the country at that point was on austerity. We had rationing for bread and potatoes. ""The founders of the NHS did not use that as a moment to hesitate, they said, 'let one of the legacies of the war be the creation of the NHS'. ""That's the same legacy we need for long-term care support in social care coming out of coronavirus."" The coronavirus crisis has placed many care homes under additional stress Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he agreed with NHS England chief executive Sir Simon. ""The system needs a huge amount of work - it has been broken for a long time,"" Sir Keir said. ""I think it has been fractured, it's been underfunded, I think the staff have been undervalued and underpaid, and the prime minister needs to take responsibility. ""The Conservative government has been in power for 10 years and therefore they've had time to start doing something about social care - they haven't done it."" A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said it had set out a ""comprehensive action plan"" to support social care in England during the pandemic. ""We know there's a need for a long-term solution for social care and there are complex questions to address,"" they added. ""We will bring forward a plan that puts social care on a sustainable footing to ensure the reforms will last long into the future."" Cap on care costs considered before outbreak Virus protection for care workers 'shambolic' Adult social care encompasses the support provided by councils to older people and younger adults with disabilities. Unlike health care, social care is not generally provided for free. In England, anyone with assets over Â£23,250 is expected to pay for some or all of their costs, leading to the prospect of some having to sell their homes to pay for care. Services have also been stretched as a result of years of funding cuts from government and growing demand linked to an ageing population. In Scotland, free personal care is available. Some care costs are capped in Wales, and home care is free for the over-75s in Northern Ireland. Political parties have been talking about reforming the sector for the past 20 years. The Conservatives previously brought forward legislation for a cap on care costs, but the plan was scrapped amid concerns about the costs of implementation. However, the idea was again considered by ministers in the current government prior to the coronavirus outbreak. At December's election, the government pledged an extra Â£1bn per year for social care in England over the next five years. It has subsequently given an extra Â£3.2bn in emergency Covid-19 funds to English councils, which can be put towards helping with social care costs. Ministers have also promised an additional Â£600m for care homes to help with controlling infections. Do you work in a care home?

"This video can not be played Hancock on holiday uncertainty: ""People are smarter than all that."" It is ""too early"" to know whether summer holidays can go ahead, the health secretary has said. Matt Hancock said there was still ""a lot of uncertainty"" but ministers were doing everything possible to make sure people could have a holiday this year. He told the BBC he had booked his own summer break in Cornwall ""months ago"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer urged the government to ""get rid of the mixed messages"" about whether people should book holidays for later in the year. Some Tory MPs and businesses also criticised the government for fuelling uncertainty for travel companies already struggling in the pandemic. It follows confusion after Transport Secretary Grant Shapps warned ""people shouldn't be booking holidays right now - not domestically or internationally"". Downing Street said Prime Minister Boris Johnson would unveil a roadmap for easing restrictions - potentially including travel - in the week beginning 22 February. Analysis by BBC political correspondent Jonathan Blake For most announcements from the government, a day here or there might not make much difference. But nobody wants to wait any longer than necessary for the promised ""roadmap"" to take England out of lockdown. So when the prime minister promised that ""on 22 February"" he would reveal that plan, Conservative MPs were among those marking their diaries. But now Downing Street has said the roadmap will come ""on the week of the 22nd"" - which isn't quite the same. In response, Tory backbenchers are warning the government not to ""backslide"" on its promise. They want to hold ministers to their aim of giving schools two weeks' notice before re-opening to all pupils on 8 March. A vocal minority of Conservative MPs have argued the current lockdown is too strict and needs to lift as soon as possible. Others have been more patient and kept faith the government will take the right decisions at the right time. But the further cases fall, the more people get the vaccine and the longer time goes on, the more pressure on the government will grow. Mr Hancock told BBC Breakfast it was too early to know which coronavirus restrictions may still be in place over the summer, but that he understood people wanted to make plans. ""People are yearning for certainty over whether they can have a summer holiday"", he said, but ""pandemics are difficult times and there is a lot of uncertainty"". ""We are doing everything that we possibly can to make sure that people can have a holiday this summer but the vaccine rollout is absolutely essential to that,"" he continued. The health secretary also said that, before summer holidays, the priority would be making sure people can see loved ones again - but it was too early to say when this might happen. Holiday bookings jump despite 'unclear rules' Don't book holiday yet, government warns Starmer: 10-year Covid jail terms 'empty threat' The latest government figures,externalshow a total of 13,509,108 people have now received the first dose of a vaccine in the UK - a rise of 450,810 from Wednesday. The UK also reported another 678 people had died within 28 days of a positive Covid test, along with a further 13,494 new daily cases. Sir Jeremy Farrar, a member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said cases needed to fall below 10,000 a day before the UK should consider easing lockdown measures, with transmission rates still ""incredibly high"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it ""doesn't make any sense"" to set out plans to ease restrictions with arbitrary dates in March or April, adding that ""the data has to drive us"". ""In 2020 we lifted restrictions too quickly... as a result the transmission went back up in this country,"" he said. Dawn Dillon, from Surrey, says her husband booked a holiday to Spain in June 2019 for the following year as her birthday present. They were able to move the trip, which cost Â£1,000 for accommodation and flights, from 2020 to June 2021. ""But what do we do now - will we lose our holiday?"" she asks. ""I know it's not a priority but it would be nice to have some clarity."" Dawn, who is 55 and asthmatic, says she had anticipated that she would have had a Covid vaccine, along with her husband, before the trip in June. ""But you don't know how advanced the vaccination process is in other countries,"" she adds. Mr Johnson told a Downing Street briefing on Wednesday that as far as holidays were concerned, people would have to be a ""little bit more patient"". The PM's official spokesman said Mr Johnson does not have a holiday planned but ""is obviously keen to have a break over the summer"". But Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth criticised ministers for not being clearer about what the public could plan for. He said he had yet to book a holiday because he was ""in the same boat as everyone else"". Sir Keir said he had a ""holding"" booking for a break in Devon in August that is ""subject to restrictions, that's the best anybody can do"". Senior Conservative MP Sir Charles Walker accused ministers of ""ripping out"" the goalposts on the timetable for lifting Covid restrictions. People ""need to have something to look forward to"", he said. Matt Hancock has already booked a holiday to Cornwall after predicting a ""Great British summer"" One travel industry leader criticised the government's plea for people to stop making summer plansas ""puerile and nonsensical"". And Heathrow Airport's chief executive said getting back to normality was not just about people's holidays but also to ""protect people's businesses and livelihood"". Meanwhile, Henry Joce, of Tencreek Holiday Park and Campsite in Cornwall, told BBC Radio 5 Live it may be too late, not too soon, to book a spot there over certain dates this summer. He said soaring demand for breaks over the past fortnight meant he was at risk of selling out during peak weeks, which he put down to people ""being desperate to get away"".

"United Airlines plans to buy 200 flying electric taxis that it hopes will fly passengers to the airport within the next five years. The US airline is one of the first major carriers to commit to the purchase of flying taxis. United Airlines will also invest in flying taxi firm Archer as part of a $1.1bn (Â£800m) deal to develop the aircraft. The aircraft need regulatory approval before the purchase can go ahead. The race to build a flying electric taxi Is the airborne commute a flight of fancy? The flying car is here â and it could change the world - BBC Future United Airlines will team up with US regional carrier Mesa Airlines to buy Archer's electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft as part of a $1bn order. The deal is seen as a stamp of approval for start-up Archer, which said it will launch its shares on the US stock market following the deal. Other investors in the start-up include carmaker Stellantis, the new company formed last month by the merger of Fiat Chrysler and France's PSA Group. United and Mesa said they predict using the taxis to fly passengers over congested highways to hub airports. California-based Archer says the taxis will be capable of flying a distance of 60 miles (95km) at 150 miles an hour (240km/h) and could nearly halve carbon dioxide emissions for passengers travelling to the airport. ""With the right technology, we can curb the impact aircraft have on the planet, but we have to identify the next generation of companies who will make this a reality early and find ways to help them get off the ground,"" United Airlines chief executive Scott Kirby said in a statement. United and Mesa have the option to buy another $500m worth of aircraft under the deal.

United Airlines lost more than $7bn last year and has relied on US government aid to avoid laying off thousands of workers. Some economists see the pandemic as an opportunity to use these stimulus funds to develop carbon-neutral air travel. Another flying taxi firm Volocopter is planning journeys into city centres using its VoloCity electric air taxi. However, ride-sharing business Uber sold off its flying taxi unit Elevate in December.

"This video can not be played Health Secretary Matt Hancock: 'We need to build a better, stronger NHS' The NHS in England is to be reformed so health and care services can work more closely together, the government says. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the planned restructure will mean a focus ""on the health of the population, not just the health of patients"". But Labour questioned the timing of the changes ""in the middle of the biggest public health crisis our NHS has ever faced"", saying staff were exhausted. Mr Hancock said there was ""no better time than now"". Afull White Paper,externalwas published on Thursday, setting out the proposed future legislation. ""The pandemic has made the changes in this White Paper more not less urgent,"" Mr Hancock told MPs. Year-long hospital waits for 225,000 in England Reforms planned for NHS in England Social care reform needed within a year - NHS boss The shake-up will see the law changed to reverse reforms of the NHS in England introduced under Prime Minister David Cameron in 2012. Ministers believe the changes will put the NHS in a better position to cope with an ageing population and a rise in people with complex health conditions. One-in-three patients admitted to hospital as an emergency has five or more health conditions, such as diabetes, obesity or asthma, up from one-in-10 a decade ago. Those working in the health service said many of the rules in place were time-consuming, frustrating and stressful. Announcing the changes to MPs, Mr Hancock said the new system would see the NHS and local councils take decisions about local health together. ""The new approach is based on the concept of population health,"" he said. Organisations called ""integrated care systems"" - which already exist in some parts of the country - will be set up in each part of England and be responsible for funding to support that area's health. ""They will provide not just for the treatments that are needed but support people to stay healthy in the first place,"" said Mr Hancock. Responding to criticism over the timing, Mr Hancock said the pandemic had ""brought home the importance of preventing ill health in the first place"". Nigel Edwards, of the Nuffield Trust think tank, said the changes would be a ""re-wiring behind the dashboard"" and should not be too noticeable to patients. While it was not a ""magic bullet"", it could help different parts of the system work more closely together, he added. The public will be rightly asking what difference these reforms make and why they are being introduced now in the middle of a pandemic. The concept predates Covid - councils and the NHS have been piloting these approaches to integrated care over the past few years. But, in many ways, the pandemic has speeded up the process. With more care being done out of hospital because of the pressures from Covid, community NHS and council care teams have been working ever more closely. There is much to recommend greater joined up working. The 21st century patient has multiple conditions. Take a 70-year-old with heart problem and dementia who lives alone. They will need input from a heart specialist, support from community nurses and maybe the company of a befriending service. The staff needed could come from three different organisations working and funded separately.  It creates bureaucracy and it is not hard to see how the quality of care suffers. The white paper is an attempt to re-wire the NHS. But those working for the NHS argue that is just one part of the solution - staffing and investment will also play a role. The proposals include scrapping the tendering rule, which sees providers and private companies compete to win contracts to run services. This rule made it complicated for councils and different parts of the NHS to set up joint teams and pool their budgets, with some having to set up separate bodies to bid for contracts. Instead, the NHS and councils will be left to run services and told to collaborate with each other to pool resources. It also gives the health secretary more control over NHS England and other national bodies, which had been given a large degree of autonomy under the 2012 changes. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said Labour had long argued for more integrated care, but raised questions over the timing. He also said the test of the reorganisation ""will be whether it brings waiting lists and times down, widens access especially for mental healthcare, drives up cancer survival rates and improves population health"". Mr Ashworth added that ""legislation alone of course is not the answer to integration. ""We need a long-term funded workforce plan. We've not got one. We need a sustainable social care plan. We were promised one on the steps of Downing Street. We still don't have one."" The UK's social care systemis under pressurewith past governments failing to reform or fund the council-run system properly. In their 2019 election manifesto, the Conservatives pledged to find a cross-party solution to reduce pressures on the sector and provide long-term funding. Mr Hancock told MPs the government was ""committed to the reform of adult social care and will bring forward proposals this year"". 11 charts on what's happened to the NHS Meanwhile, NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens said the reform will create a ""flexible can-do spirit"" across the health and care system. The White Paper will cite examples of good practice, such as a care team at the Royal Derby Hospital which sees nurses from the community, council care services and hospital staff working together to plan the discharge of patients. Chris Hopson, of NHS Providers, which represents NHS managers, said it would end ""an unnecessarily rigid NHS approach to procurement"". The Local Government Association welcomed the plans but said they did not provide the funding to put care services on a ""sustainable and long-term footing"".

"This video can not be played Sir Simon Stevens: ""We do not have a fair and properly resourced adult social care system"" Plans to adequately fund the social care sector need to be in place within a year, the head of NHS England has said. Sir Simon Stevens told the BBC the Covid-19 crisis had shone a ""very harsh spotlight"" on the ""resilience"" of the care system. He said there was a need to ""decisively answer"" how high quality care could be provided long-term. The Department of Health said it would bring forward a plan for reform. In their 2019 election manifesto, the Conservatives pledged to find a cross-party solution to reduce pressures on the sector and provide long-term funding. 10 charts that show whatâs gone wrong with social care What are the problems with the social care system? Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr programme, Sir Simon said the Covid-19 pandemic should be used to give momentum to plans to overhaul how the system works. ""If any good is to come from this, we must use this as a moment to resolve once and for all to actually properly resource and reform the way in which social care works in this country,"" he said. ""The reality is that after at least two decades of talking about it, we do not have a fair and properly resourced adult social care system with a proper set of workforce supports."" He added: ""I would hope by the time we are sitting down this time next year on the 73rd birthday of the NHS that we have actually, as a country, been able to decisively answer the question of how are we going to fund and provide high-quality social care for my parents' generation. ""If you take back the history coming out of the Second World War, the country at that point was on austerity. We had rationing for bread and potatoes. ""The founders of the NHS did not use that as a moment to hesitate, they said, 'let one of the legacies of the war be the creation of the NHS'. ""That's the same legacy we need for long-term care support in social care coming out of coronavirus."" The coronavirus crisis has placed many care homes under additional stress Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he agreed with NHS England chief executive Sir Simon. ""The system needs a huge amount of work - it has been broken for a long time,"" Sir Keir said. ""I think it has been fractured, it's been underfunded, I think the staff have been undervalued and underpaid, and the prime minister needs to take responsibility. ""The Conservative government has been in power for 10 years and therefore they've had time to start doing something about social care - they haven't done it."" A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said it had set out a ""comprehensive action plan"" to support social care in England during the pandemic. ""We know there's a need for a long-term solution for social care and there are complex questions to address,"" they added. ""We will bring forward a plan that puts social care on a sustainable footing to ensure the reforms will last long into the future."" Cap on care costs considered before outbreak Virus protection for care workers 'shambolic' Adult social care encompasses the support provided by councils to older people and younger adults with disabilities. Unlike health care, social care is not generally provided for free. In England, anyone with assets over Â£23,250 is expected to pay for some or all of their costs, leading to the prospect of some having to sell their homes to pay for care. Services have also been stretched as a result of years of funding cuts from government and growing demand linked to an ageing population. In Scotland, free personal care is available. Some care costs are capped in Wales, and home care is free for the over-75s in Northern Ireland. Political parties have been talking about reforming the sector for the past 20 years. The Conservatives previously brought forward legislation for a cap on care costs, but the plan was scrapped amid concerns about the costs of implementation. However, the idea was again considered by ministers in the current government prior to the coronavirus outbreak. At December's election, the government pledged an extra Â£1bn per year for social care in England over the next five years. It has subsequently given an extra Â£3.2bn in emergency Covid-19 funds to English councils, which can be put towards helping with social care costs. Ministers have also promised an additional Â£600m for care homes to help with controlling infections. Do you work in a care home?

"The NHS faces a number of challenges and often tops the list of concerns voiced by the public, but what state is it actually in? Last year more than Â£156bn was spent on health across the UK - about 12 times the figure that was spent 70 years ago. And that's after you adjust it for inflation. It means today about 30p out of every Â£1 spent on public services goes on health. Ever since the early 1950s the budget has been increasing, but the scale of those rises has varied quite considerably. The average rise has been just over 4%. The biggest rises were seen under the Labour governments between 1997 and 2010 when the average annual rise was about 6%. This dropped to 1% under the post-financial crisis coalition government between 2010 and 2015 - a figure which then rose under the majority Conservative government of recent years. The Conservatives have said their five-year funding plan for the NHS will see the budget rise by an average of 3.4% a year above inflation. It means that by 2023-24 there would be Â£149bn of funding available. By comparison, during the 2019 General Election, Labour proposed increasing it by 3.9% - bringing the budget to Â£155bn by 2023-24. The Lib Dems were marginally behind this coming in at Â£154bn. Spot the difference on the NHS Reality Check: Is the NHS boost Â£84bn or Â£20bn? Labour often talk about the risk of privatisation of the NHS, accusing the Conservatives of wanting to do a deal with US President Donald Trump. Private firms are already involved in providing NHS care. Just over 7% of the budget goes on private providers, up from just over 5% in 2011-12. These can be deals to run a specific service or to take on some NHS patients for routine treatments like hip and knee replacements. But it still leaves the overwhelming majority of care provided by the state and state-employed staff. Actually, GPs are technically independent small businesses contracted to provide a service to the NHS - but they tend not to be considered as private providers. Reality Check: How much does the NHS spend on the private sector? NHS money also goes to the private sector to purchase drugs and equipment. Nearly all of this is bought centrally so the NHS can use its bargaining power to negotiate good deals. A recent example of this was the agreement reached with Vertex to fund its cystic fibrosis treatments. The NHS got a significant saving on the price the drug manufacturer originally wanted. Fears have been raised that US firms would want the NHS to agree more lucrative deals - they get more money for their drugs in their own country.  But given the cost to the NHS of such a concession many doubt this is likely. There are three key targets for hospitals: covering A&E, cancer care and routine operations, such as knee and hip replacements. All parts of the UK have been struggling to hit them. The way they are measured differs between the UK nations. The A&E target is the most directly comparable - in that each nation expects 95% of patients to be treated or admitted in four hours. Performance is worse in Wales and Northern Ireland than it is in England and Scotland. Scotland is the last nation to have hit the target - back in the summer of 2017. Meanwhile, in cancer care patients are meant to start treatment within 62 days of an urgent GP referral. But that too is being missed, while waiting lists for routine treatments are rising. In England it has topped 4.4 million - the highest on record. Some 15% have waited more than the target time of 18 weeks. The ageing population is certainly a major factor for the growing pressures - and it is one with which all health systems in the world are struggling. Medical advances have meant that people are living longer. When the NHS was created, life expectancy was 13 years shorter than it is now. This is something to celebrate. Infectious diseases are no longer a significant threat. Heart attacksdo not claim the lives of people earlyin the same numbers. Evencancer is not the death sentence it once was- half of peoplenow survive for a decade or more. 'I won't let my chronic illness trap me in loneliness' What do the people of the world die from? But this progress has come at a cost. People are living with a growing number of long-term chronic conditions - diabetes, heart disease and dementia. These are more about care than cure - what patients usually need is support. That level of ill-health means the average 65-year-old costs the NHS 2.5 times more than the average 30-year-old. A 90-year-old costs more than seven times as much. As the number of older people continues to rise so will the cost to the NHS. This is compounded by other factors, including the rising cost of new drugs and high levels of obesity. A third of adults are so overweight they are risking their health significantly. Colluding drug firms 'cost NHS millions' UK most obese nation in Western Europe All this contributes to what health economists call health inflation - the idea that the cost of providing care outstrips the normal rise in the cost of living across the economy. This is why health has tended to receive more generous rises than other areas of government spending. But despite this the UK has been left trailing some other parts of Europe when it comes to spending as a proportion of GDP, which is a measure of the size of the economy. It is a gap that has widened since the previous Labour government was in power from 1997 to 2010. The result, as you would expect, is fewer beds, doctors and nurses per patient in the UK than the big spenders, which tend to tax people more. Germany, for example,has almost twice as many nurses per capita,externalthan the UK. But the lack of staff in the NHS is not just because of less spending, the health service cannot even fill the posts for which it has got funding. The NHS in Englandhas nearly 100,000 jobs unfilled at the moment,external. The total represents one in 12 of all the posts in the health service and would be enough to staff 10 large hospitals. It includes about 40,000 nurse posts and nearly 10,000 doctor vacancies. Some of the gaps are filled using overtime and agency staff, but some simply go unfilled. There are various initiatives in place to recruit and retain staff. And the number of training places for doctors and nurses are increasing. While the government has been able to put more money into the NHS, one element of the budget that has been cut is the money set aside for capital projects. That covers the cost of infrastructure, such as building works and IT. In recent years that has resulted in a growing maintenance backlog with hospitals having to contend with leaky roofs, out-of-date equipment and crumbling buildings. NHS claims fact-checked Government plans billions for hospital projects The capital budget increased by Â£1bn for 2019-20, bringing the budget up to Â£7bn. The NHS is also under pressure because of the problems in the social care system. Social care includes day centres, help in the home for tasks such as washing and dressing, and good quality care in care homes during the final years of life. It is seen as essential to keep people well and living independently - and out of hospital. The system is means-tested in England, which means only the poorest receive help from councils towards the cost of care. But even then it is heavily rationed. The result is growing numbers of older people going without care. According to Age UK, 1.4 million people over the age of 65 are not getting the care they need. That represents one in seven of all older people and is a rise of nearly a fifth in two years. This lack of care in the community has been directly linked to the growing pressures on hospitals by the Care Quality Commission, the body responsible for regulating standards across health and social care. Where in England does care cost the most? The crisis in care Does free personal care solve the crisis? Hunt: Care cuts went 'too far' The regulator believes that without reform of the system, the extra money being put into the NHS could be swallowed up without a noticeable improvement in performance. The other parts of the UK can make a case for being more generous in this respect - home care is capped in Wales and free for the over-75s in Northern Ireland, while Scotland provides free personal care (washing and dressing) in both care homes and people's own homes. Despite the challenges being faced by the NHS, the majority of the public say they are satisfied with services. The British Social Attitudes poll of nearly 3,000 people found 53% of people in England, Scotland and Wales were satisfied with services in 2018. But levels of satisfaction are falling. The latest score was athree percentage point drop since 2017and the lowest level since 2007. A peak of 70% was seen in 2010. Experts say waiting times and a lack of staff were major concerns as ratings for GPs dropped to an all-time low. Reality Check: Is the NHS boost Â£84bn or Â£20bn?

"Officer Eugene Goodman is being celebrated for his heroics Capitol Police Officer Eugene Goodman is being called a hero for a second time after footage shown at the impeachment trial shows him directing Mitt Romney away from an advancing mob. In the video, the officer is seen notifying Mr Romney that the rioters were heading in his direction and guiding him away. The Utah senator, an unpopular figure among Trump supporters, said he looked forward to thanking the police officer for his actions. Officer Goodman was already being praised for his bravery that day, after singlehandedly steering a mob away from the Senate chambers. Video footage showed him just steps ahead of rioters as they chase him up a flight of stairs. Mr Goodman is then seen glancing towards the Senate entrance before luring the men in the opposite direction. Five people, including a police officer, died as a result of the riots. The officer was seen confronting a pro-Trump rioter during the attack Members of the 2,000-person Capitol police department are tasked with protecting the Capitol building and those inside, it. A group of senators has introduced a bill to award Officer Goodman with the Congressional Gold Medal. News of his additional heroics involving Senator Romney will only amplify calls for him to be recognised. The senator said he was unaware of the danger he was in until he saw the footage at the trial on Wednesday. Senator Mitt Romney said he was looking forward to thanking Officer Goodman It formed part of the Democratic prosecution in trying to underline the peril the heart of US government was under as Trump supporters ransacked the Capitol. Senator Romney said it was ""overwhelmingly distressing and emotional"" to see the violence again, six weeks after the attack. And reflecting on his own narrow escape, he added he was looking forward to thanking Officer Goodman ""when I next see him"". This video can not be played See how close the mob got to Mike Pence, Mitt Romney and other lawmakers New York Law School criminal law professor and 20-year veteran of the New York City Police Department Kirk Burkhalter called Mr Goodman's response to the rioters ""tremendous"". ""I don't think there was any type of training that would prepare you for that situation,"" Mr Burkhalter told the BBC, speaking days after the attack. In the video shot by Huffington Post reporter Igor Bobic, Mr Goodman, who is black, is antagonised by the group of Trump supporters - who are all white men. The man at the front of the pack, wearing a QAnon T-shirt, has been identified as Doug Jensen of Iowa. He was later arrested by local police and the FBI for his role in the riots. Footage shows Mr Jensen leading the mob that chased Mr Goodman up a flight of stairs - just a few feet away from the entrance to the Senate floor. As he is pursued, Mr Goodman shouts ""second floor!"" into his radio, seemingly alerting other officers of the group approaching the chamber. Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played FA Cup highlights: Everton 5-4 Tottenham Hotspur Everton reached the FA Cup quarter-finals after edging out Tottenham Hotspur in a nine-goal classic at Goodison Park. A magnificent contest swung in both teams' favour before Carlo Ancelotti's hosts - showing huge reserves of resolve and fitness - finally struck the decisive blow when substitute Bernard fired home in the seventh minute of extra time. Spurs dominated the early exchanges and were rewarded when Davinson Sanchez headed in from a corner in the third minute before Everton sprang to life with a three-goal burst inside eight minutes before half-time. Dominic Calvert-Lewin, who later went off with what looked like a groin injury, levelled nine minutes before the break with a shot Spurs goalkeeper Hugo Lloris should have saved, before Richarlison's fine low drive and Gylfi Sigurdsson's penalty looked to have put Everton in command. But Erik Lamela scored in the closing seconds of the first half to put Spurs back in contention and Sanchez pounced again after more chaos at a corner to drag Jose Mourinho's side level just before the hour. Mourinho had introduced Harry Kane as a substitute just before that equaliser but it was Everton who edged ahead again as more brilliant individual work by Richarlison restored their advantage after 68 minutes - but it was inevitable Spurs' main man would have a say. It came with seven minutes of normal time left as Everton were undone by the old firm, Son Heung-min's cross the perfect invitation for Kane to score with a far-post header. All the momentum appeared to be with Spurs but Everton are now a side to be reckoned with under Ancelotti and Bernard cashed in after more good work by Sigurdsson - who claimed three assists - to beat Lloris with an angled finish. There was still time for Spurs to respond but Everton saw out an outstanding victory in relative comfort, certainly given what had gone before, to secure a place in the last eight. Everything you need to know about FA Cup quarter-final draw Reaction and analysis from all of Wednesday's FA Cup fifth-round ties Lawro's FA Cup fifth-round predictions v Radio 1's Jack Saunders Football Daily podcast: Everton edge Tottenham in nine-goal thriller This video can not be played The good, the bad, the Gylfi - Sigurdsson pivotal to  Everton win Ancelotti, the manager who has seen it all, was the calmest man amid the mayhem inside Goodison Park - celebrating what turned out to be the winner from Bernard by simply blowing on his cup of coffee while his backroom staff reacted wildly. This was perhaps the Italian's finest moment since coming to Everton, his side - without the injured James Rodriguez, Andre Gomes and Jordan Pickford - showing remarkable energy, spirit and a capacity to recover from adversity to outlast their visitors. Ancelotti will be concerned about some of Everton's questionable defending - especially from corners - and the injury to Calvert-Lewin, but he will also be justifiably proud of how they fought back to win when, at several stages, the tide seemed to be turning against them. The sight of Calvert-Lewin going off, Spurs danger man Kane having just come on and losing a two-goal lead as the hour mark approached could have undermined Everton but they carried a threat throughout, with Richarlison back to his menacing best after a season where he has not been in peak form. In midfield, both Tom Davies and Abdoulaye Doucoure were outstanding, the latter demonstrating remarkable fitness and still running non-stop until the final seconds, while his young team-mate continues to flourish under the sympathetic guidance of Ancelotti. Sigurdsson, who scored calmly from the spot after Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg tripped Calvert-Lewin, was also a huge creative force and contributed hugely to Everton's attacking threat. Everton are seeking their first trophy since they won the FA Cup in 1995 - they beat Spurs in the semi-finals on that occasion - and this victory will raise hopes not just of further progress in the competition, but for their long-term development under of one of Europe's most decorated managers. The scenes of elation at the final whistle were understandable and fully deserved. Everton gave everything and were rewarded. This video can not be played Analysis: Pundits praise 'brave' Tottenham display Mourinho would have hoped to build on Sunday's Premier League win against West Bromwich Albion after three successive defeats - but he was left to survey the end of Spurs' FA Cup ambitions after a dramatic night on freezing Merseyside. It all looked good for Spurs for the first half-hour as they had a deserved lead, but the manner in which they capitulated for those crucial minutes to concede three goals just before the break, and then continued to look vulnerable, meant this was a very damaging night. Spurs, after criticism of Mourinho's perceived conservative approach in recent weeks, were positive and played with attacking intent throughout with some sparkling passing but were let down by dreadful defending and another expensive error from Lloris, who should have saved Calvert-Lewin's equaliser but only helped a powerful drive that was straight at him into the net. Mourinho did not risk Kane from the start after his return from an ankle injury at the weekend, but when he was introduced it was with Spurs looking the more likely winners. He will be particularly frustrated with his porous defence, given his stock-in-trade is meant to be a rearguard that gives nothing away. This looked nothing like a Mourinho team in a defensive context. This was the first time a team managed by Mourinho has conceded five goals since his Chelsea side lost 5-3 to his predecessor Mauricio Pochettino's Tottenham in January 2015. And another sub-plot to this FA Cup exit was the absence of Gareth Bale, who Mourinho said had complained of a muscular issue so was not even on the bench. Bale's return to Spurs on loan from Real Madrid, hailed as a coup when he arrived, has turned into a huge anti-climax. It will continue to  be a distraction if results do not improve. This was a night where there was very little in the way of good news for Mourinho and Spurs - and next they face a visit to rampant Manchester City on Saturday. Everton assistant boss Duncan Ferguson to BBC Sport:""It was an exciting game. Tottenham started better than us and got the lead but we got ourselves back into the game. ""At 3-1 you're thinking 'get to half-time at 3-1' and then they score to put us on the back foot. Exciting game, fantastic. ""It's 25 years since we won the FA Cup. It would be great to get to the final. It keeps your season going. We want to do well in the Premier League but the FA Cup is the one we want."" Tottenham boss Jose Mourinho, speaking to BBC Sport:""If you say it was fantastic, it was fantastic. I'm not a neutral. ""When you score four goals, you have to win. The way we played, we should win comfortably. Attacking football and defensive mistakes. ""The players gave everything. I have to admit for some of them it was not easy because you play so well and one, two, three mistakes and you're losing 3-1. ""OK, I take positives. Amazing to watch."" This was the highest scoring FA Cup game between two top-flight teams since February 1961 when Sheffield Wednesday won 7-2 against Man Utd. In what is the 981st match of his managerial career, this is the first time a Jose Mourinho side has both scored and conceded at least four goals in a single game. Mourinho has seen his team concede five goals in a game for the first time since January 2015, when his Chelsea side were beaten 5-3 by Mauricio Pochettino's Spurs in the Premier League. There were just seven minutes and 26 seconds between Everton's first and third goals against Tottenham. While it was the first time a Mourinho led side conceded three first-half goals since Man Utd away at Brighton in August 2018. Dominic Calvert-Lewin scored his 50th goal in all competitions for Everton (159th app), with 26 of his goals for the Toffees coming under Carlo Ancelotti. Gylfi Sigurdsson became the first Everton player to assist three goals in a single match since Steven Pienaar against Fulham in a Premier League tie in April 2012. Nine of the 12 goals in all competitions scored by Colombian players for Premier League sides this season have come at Goodison Park (James Rodriguez - four, Yerry Mina - three, Davinson Sanchez - three). Harry Kane has now scored 209 goals in 318 appearances in all competitions for Tottenham, making him the second highest scorer in the club's history behind only Jimmy Greaves (266 goals in 379 apps). Son Heung-min has provided 12 assists in all competitions this season - his most in a single campaign for Spurs.

"Self-isolation rules are changing in some parts of the UK for fully vaccinated adults and children under 18. If they are identified as a close contact of someone who's tested positive for Covid, they may soon be able to take a PCR test rather than self-isolate for 10 days. You mustself-isolate for 10 daysif you: test positive for Covid-19 live with someone who tests positive are approached by text, email or phone by contact tracers who identify you as a close contact of someone who has tested positive arrive in the UK from ared list country,external arrive in the UK from France arrive from any otheramber list country,externaland you are 18 or over, and have not been vaccinated You must also self-isolate if you or someone you live with hasCovid symptoms. You can stop self-isolating if the person with symptoms gets a negative PCR result. Each UK nation has its own contact-tracing service: England -NHS Test and Trace,external Scotland -Test and Protect,external Wales -Test, Trace, Protect,external Northern Ireland -Contact tracing service,external When peopletest positive,externalfor coronavirus, they are asked to provide details of their close contacts. These include: people they've spent at least 15 minutes with, at a distance of less than 2m (6ft) sexual partners, people they live with or have had face-to-face conversations with, at a distance of less than 1m (3ft) If you are deemed a close contact, other people in your household don't have to self-isolate unless you or they develop symptoms. Scotland From 9 August, fully vaccinated adults identified as close contacts of someone who tested positive for Covid will no longer have to self-isolate for 10 days. Instead, if they have no symptoms and at least two weeks have passed since the second dose, they can get a PCR test. If the result is negative, self-isolation can then be ended. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced a similar change - with a negative PCR result - for people aged 17 or under. Children under the age of five will be encouraged, but not required, to take a PCR test. England From 16 August,external, fully vaccinated adults and all under-18s contacted by NHS Test and Trace (not the app) will be advisedto take one PCR testas soon as possible. As long as that is negative, and they don't develop symptoms, they won't need to take further action. Wales Similar changes will happen in Walesfrom 7 August,external. However, people will be also advised to take PCR test on day two and day eight, whether they are fully vaccinated or not. Northern Ireland Ministers in Northern Ireland are expectedto discuss changes on 12 August. Any adult not fully vaccinated will still need to isolate if they are identified as contacts. Anyone who tests positive - regardless of age, vaccination status, or whether or not they have symptoms - will also still need to self-isolate. TheNHS Covid app,externalis available to download in England and Wales. If you have the app, and you spend enough time close to another person using it, you will receive a ""ping"" alert if they later test positive for Covid. You need to be within 2m (6ft) of them for 15 minutes to trigger the alert. Northern IrelandandScotlandhave separate apps. If you are ""pinged"" you're advised - but not legally obliged -to self-isolate for 10 days. Government ministers have said it is ""crucial""  that people self-isolate when sent an alert. However, it's feared that the large number of people being alerted has led tomany users deleting the app. Currently, when someone tested positive but had no symptoms, the NHS Covid app went back five days before the test, and alerted any close contacts during that time. However, the app will soon only alert close contactsfrom the previous two days before the positive test. The sensitivity of the app itself has not changed, and anyone testing positive will still have to self-isolate. In the week to 28 July, nearly 396,000 people in England and Wales received alerts from the app, a sharp drop from 690,000 the week before. In England, employers providing critical services can now request an exemption for named employees who are fully vaccinated.Sectors include energy and emergency services,external. Supermarket depot workers and food manufacturers are among those exempt from quarantine rules whatever their vaccination status. A similar system is being launched in Scotland. AÂ£500 grant is available,externalin England to people on low incomes who have to self-isolate. This includes parents who can't work because their child has to self-isolate. However, manyapplications have been turned down. In Scotland people can apply for theSelf-Isolation Support Grant,external, worth Â£500, and there isa similar scheme in Wales,external. In Northern Irelanda discretionary payment is available.,external You may also be entitled toStatutory Sick Pay,external, which is worth Â£96.35 a week, or more if your employer has a sick pay scheme.
