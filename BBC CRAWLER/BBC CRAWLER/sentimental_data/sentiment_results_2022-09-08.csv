"Some of the UK's biggest strikes have been called off after the death of Queen Elizabeth II. Unions representing Royal Mail postal workers and rail staff said that ""out of respect for her service to the country and her family"" they had chosen to cancel immediate strike action. Queen Elizabeth II, the UK's longest-serving monarch, died at Balmoral aged 96, after reigning for 70 years. Some shops have announced temporary closures as a mark of respect. The planned strike action by postal workers on Friday 9 September and RMT rail worker walkouts on 15 and 17 September has been suspended. The train drivers' union Aslef has also postponed a strike planned for 15 September. The Rail Delivery Group said train timetables would be normal now that strikes were not going ahead. A spokesperson from the Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators, said it welcomed the decision by the RMT to call off next week's strike action at a time of ""national mourning"". ""The whole railway family is united in sending our condolences to the Royal Family,"" the spokesperson said. Network Rail has confirmed that train services will run as normal next week. It will also look at any scheduled weekend engineering works that fall within the ""laying in state period"" and scale it back. Works might be postponed if they prevent people from travelling to London to pay their respects. Obituary: A long life marked by a sense of duty Queen Elizabeth II: A life in pictures This is the moment history stops King Charles III, the new monarch The RMT union intends to reschedule the strikes, but has not yet decided when. It would need to give two weeks' notice of any action, as would the Aslef union. RMT general secretary Mick Lynch said that his union joined the ""whole nation in paying its respects"" to Queen Elizabeth. ""We express our deepest condolences to her family, friends and the country,"" he added. Train drivers' union Aslef said: ""In light of the sad news of Queen Elizabeth II's death, Aslef is postponing its industrial action on 15 September. We express our deepest condolences to her family, friends and the country."" The TSSA rail union has also cancelled planned industrial action for September and said it would be ""respecting the period of public mourning"". The Trades Unions Congress said it would postpone its annual congress until later this autumn following the death of the Queen. A spokesman said it was ""as a mark of respect"" and recognised ""her many years of dedicated service to the country"". Staff in the CWU, which represents postal workers, had been on strike on Thursday. But the union cancelled Friday's planned walkout after the Queen's death was announced. CWU general secretary Dave Ward said the action had been cancelled, ""following the very sad news of the passing of the Queen, and out of respect for her service to the country and her family"". Workers across a range of industries including BT call centre staff, Openreach engineers, railway workers and barristers have walked out in recent weeks in pay disputes as wages fail to keep up with soaring prices. The Criminal Bar Association said that planned barristers' demonstrations next week had been cancelled ""out of respect"". But it added that there had been ""no movement"" from the government so industrial action would continue. Shops such as Selfridge's, which was granted a royal warrant in 2001, closed early on Thursday and it said it would remain shut on Friday before reopening this weekend. Toy store chain The Entertainer will also be closed on Friday and offered its ""sincere condolences"" to the Royal Family. Betting shops Betfred and William Hill have said they will close on Friday. Tourist attraction Legoland Windsor is also closed on Friday. The theme park said those who were due to visit would receive an email about their booking.

"This video can not be played WATCH: Liz Truss announces energy price guarantee for next two years New Prime Minister Liz Truss will limit energy bill rises for all households for two years as the new prime minister tries to prevent widespread hardship. A typical household energy bill will be capped at Â£2,500 annually until 2024. The huge support scheme could cost up to Â£150bn, but Ms Truss refused to put a figure on it, saying ""extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures"". Businesses will get help, with prices capped for six months, a shorter period of protection than many had hoped for. The help will be for everyone in England, Scotland and Wales with equivalent assistance for Northern Ireland. But there are concerns the measures are not targeted enough, with no additional support for the most vulnerable. As a result, millions are still expected to be in fuel poverty this winter. The energy price cap - the highest amount suppliers are allowed to charge households for every unit of energy they use - had been due to rise to Â£3,549 for a typical household from October. To limit the amount customers' bills go up by, the unit price will be capped, although household energy bills will vary according to how much gas and electricity they use. The government will compensate energy firms for the difference between the wholesale price for gas and electricity they pay and the amount they can charge customers. 'Government help on energy bills is no use to me' What the new energy plan means for you How much are energy bills rising under the new plan? Where does the government borrow billions from? Commenting on what steps households should now take, Greg Jackson, chief executive and founder of Octopus Energy, said firms were still working through the details and customers should ""sit tight and wait to hear from their energy supplier"". ""Nothing will change until 1 October and we'll be in touch with everyone before then."" The dramatic state intervention will be funded by government borrowing, adding to the UK's already large debt pile. The total cost of the support will depend on the cost of energy on the international energy markets, which can be extremely volatile. This comes after Ms Truss rejected calls to extend a windfall tax on gas and oil company profits to pay for the package. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the refusal to fund it with a windfall tax showed she was ""driven by dogma"" and ""it's working people who will pay for that"". Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey accused the government of bringing in a ""phony freeze"" while ""refusing to properly tax the eye-watering profits of oil and gas companies."" ""This will still leave struggling families and pensioners facing impossible choices this winter as energy bills almost double,"" he said. Ms Truss argued it was ""the moment to be bold"". ""We are facing a global energy crisis, and there are no cost-free options,"" she said. Gas prices have soared this year, largely due to the conflict in Ukraine which has reduced supplies of Russian gas. Experts and charities warned that without help with soaring energy bills, lives would have been at risk this winter, with people struggling to afford basic day-to-day living costs. Citizens Advice chief executive Dame Clare Moriarty, told the BBC the package will provide ""much-needed relief for millions"" but said she was concerned it is not going to reverse the trends it was seeing. ""We're seeing problems turn up in the summer, which we would normally expect to be winter."" Ms Truss also outlined plans ""to make sure we have security of [energy] supply for the long-term"". This includes issuing new oil and gas exploration licences for the North Sea and lifting the ban on fracking for shale gas ""where there is local support for it"". In addition the government will: Scrap green levies - which add Â£150 to bills each year - which the Â£2,500 cap accounts for Continue with a previously announced Â£400 energy bills discount for all households. Taken together, the government said this ""will bring costs close to where the energy price cap stands today"". Launch a new oil and gas licensing round as early as next week, boosting production in the North Sea Seek to negotiate lower-priced long-term contracts with renewable and nuclear power companies Launch a joint scheme with the Bank of England to provide emergency support to struggling UK energy firms Launch a review to ensure the UK is meeting its Net Zero 2050 target in ""an economically-efficient way"", given the altered economic landscape. The decision to lift the ban on fracking will be controversial.The practice was halted in 2019- as outlined in the Tory Party 2019 manifesto - amid opposition from environmentalists and local concerns over earth tremors. The scheme to limit energy costs for businesses will also cover public sector groups like schools and charities. It will be in place for six months though it will be reviewed in three month's time ""to consider where this should be targeted to make sure those most in need get support"". The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) welcomed the help but said the announcement was ""sparse on detail"". ""Small businesses' instant reaction is that this is not enough information, yet, for them to plan,"" said Martin McTague, chairman of the FSB. Downing Street said the price cap would boost economic growth and curb inflation by as much as 5%. The rate at which prices rise is currently at a 40-year high of 10.1%, largely driven by soaring energy prices. The energy plan is a huge emergency intervention in keeping with the pandemic rescue package. It will lessen the anticipated pain in households and businesses, but not eliminate it. The recession the economy is heading for should be shallower. But these are the headlines of what the plan promises. It is unprecedented for an announcement of this size, to have so few details on the mechanisms involved, and no details on the costs. There is much up for grabs. Some allowance could be given for the fact the administration is only two days old. But it is clear from our reporting up and down the country that more businesses that have closed could have been saved if this package had come more quickly. And the uncertainty for business will not be settled until the actual unit price of energy is announced. The size of the intervention, which looks well in excess of Â£100bn, looks likely to raise questions about whether the PM can deliver her complete programme of promised immediate tax cuts. Much will depend on negotiations with renewables producers and a plan to buy gas on long-term contracts. There is a long queue of nations currently doing the same. Expect to see the new PM in Oslo, Ottawa and the Gulf before long. The plans for long-term production reflect a strategic decision not to be dependent on imported energy, that will take some time to come to fruition.

"The new Prime Minister, Liz Truss, has outlined her plans to deal with soaring energy bills faced by households and businesses. At its heart is a move to limit the 80% rise in domestic bills that was earmarked for October. This is what it means for you. You will still pay for the gas and electricity you use. But the government's Energy Price Guarantee will limit the price that suppliers can charge for each unit of energy. For a typical household - one that uses 12,000 kWh (kilowatt hours) of gas a year, and 2,900 kWh of electricity a year - it means an annual bill will not rise above Â£2,500 from October. Without this intervention, that annual bill would have been Â£3,549 a year. Last winter it was Â£1,277 a year. However, if you use more gas or electricity than that, you will pay more. This guarantee will last for two years. In precise terms, the average unit price for dual fuel customers paying by direct debit will be limited to 34.0p per kilowatt hour (kWh) for electricity and 10.3p per kWh for gas. Standing charges will still see the slight rise planned for October. Not directly on your bill or taxes. However, the government is paying for this by borrowing the money. That adds it to the pot of national debt. The prime minister says the cost will be outlined later this month. In time, that could be paid for through taxation, but at the moment the government will borrow the money on international markets and pay a premium as a result. So-called ""green levies"" will be moved off bills, and again paid for through borrowing on taxation. Yes, these canamount to hundreds of pounds this winter. So far, a first instalment of Â£326 has been paid to low-income households on certain benefits and tax credits. There is also a Â£400 discount on bills for all households over the winter. These payments will only be paid this winter, under current plans, whereas the cap will be in place for two years. So, there will be an effective rise in what householders pay next winter. The government says that the same level of support will be provided to households in Northern Ireland, as it is in the rest of the UK. However, this will require legislation. The prime minister said a fund will be created to support those who are not covered by a cap, but she did not say how big that fund would be. This includes people who use heating oil in their homes, those who have communal heating schemes, and people in mobile home parks who pay the park owner rather than a supplier. More details will come later, but this will be an extremely complex task. The government did say there would be a payment of Â£100 to households across the UK who are not covered by the price guarantee. However, some issues are still outstanding. For example, people in park homes do not yet know how they will receive the Â£400 discount available to everyone - and that was announced months ago. Fixed deals allow you to pay for energy at a set rate for a set period of time, but you are locked in. Plenty of people whose fixed deals have expired in recent months may have considered fixing again, given the outlook of rising energy prices. This has been an extremely expensive option, but one which some understandably chose to take given the eyewatering forecasts of soaring bills. The prime minister did not mention fixed deals in her statement. However, since then, the government has said that fixed rate deals which are higher than than price cap rate will be automatically discounted by 17p per kWh for electricity and 4.2p per kWh for gas at the start of October. That is the equivalent of a Â£1,000 or so reduction for a household using a typical amount of energy. However, it means somebody on a fixed rate could still be paying a higher unit charge than the price cap - if their fix had been much more expensive. There is no automatic right to cancel a fixed deal without a penalty, unless you fixed within the last 14 days. It may be the individuals need to negotiate with their provider. Businesses will get support, with bills capped for six months, a shorter period of protection than many had hoped for. This support will focus on businesses on variable deals, or whose contracts are soon to come to an end.More details are here.

"The long reign of Queen Elizabeth II was marked by her strong sense of duty and her determination to dedicate her life to her throne and to her people. She became for many the one constant point in a rapidly changing world as British influence declined, society changed beyond recognition and the role of the monarchy itself came into question. Her success in maintaining the monarchy through such turbulent times was even more remarkable given that, at the time of her birth, no-one could have foreseen that the throne would be her destiny. Elizabeth Alexandra Mary Windsor was born on 21 April 1926, in a house just off Berkeley Square in London, the first child of Albert, Duke of York, second son of George V, and his duchess, the former Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon. Baby Elizabeth with her parents at her christening Both Elizabeth and her sister, Margaret Rose, who was born in 1930, were educated at home and brought up in a loving family atmosphere. Elizabeth was extremely close to both her father and her grandfather, George V. At the age of six, Elizabeth told her riding instructor that she wanted to become a ""country lady with lots of horses and dogs"". She was said to have shown a remarkable sense of responsibility from a very early age. Winston Churchill, the future prime minister, was quoted as saying that she possessed ""an air of authority that was astonishing in an infant"". Despite not attending school, Elizabeth proved adept at languages and made a detailed study of constitutional history. A special Girl Guides company, the 1st Buckingham Palace, was formed so that she could socialise with girls of her own age. On the death of George V in 1936, his eldest son, known as David, became Edward VIII. However, his choice of wife, the twice-divorced American Wallis Simpson, was deemed to be unacceptable on political and religious grounds. At the end of the year he abdicated. Princess Elizabeth, with her parents and younger sister Margaret, at the time of her father's ""very, very wonderful"" Coronation Princesses Elizabeth (right) and Margaret broadcast to the nation in World War Two A reluctant Duke of York became King George VI. His Coronation gave Elizabeth a foretaste of what lay in store for her and she later wrote that she had found the service ""very, very wonderful"". Against a background of increasing tension in Europe, the new King, together with his wife, Queen Elizabeth, set out to restore public faith in the monarchy. Their example was not lost on their elder daughter. In 1939, the 13-year-old princess accompanied the King and Queen to the Royal Naval College at Dartmouth. Together with her sister Margaret, she was escorted by one of the cadets, her third cousin, Prince Philip of Greece. It was not the first time they had met, but it was the first time she took an interest in him. Prince Philip called on his royal relatives when on leave from the navy, and by 1944, when she was 18, Elizabeth was clearly in love with him. She kept his picture in her room and they exchanged letters. The young princess briefly joined the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS) towards the end of the war, learning to drive and service a lorry. On VE Day, she joined the Royal Family at Buckingham Palace as thousands gathered in The Mall to celebrate the end of the war in Europe. ""We asked my parents if we could go out and see for ourselves,"" she later recalled. ""I remember we were terrified of being recognised. I remember lines of unknown people linking arms and walking down Whitehall, all of us just swept along on a tide of happiness and relief."" After the war, her desire to marry Prince Philip faced a number of obstacles. The King was reluctant to lose a daughter on whom he doted, and Philip had to overcome the prejudice of an establishment that could not accept his foreign ancestry. Princess Elizabeth's wedding to Philip Mountbatten brightened the post-war gloom But the wishes of the couple prevailed and on 20 November 1947 the couple married in Westminster Abbey. The Duke of Edinburgh, as Philip had become, remained a serving naval officer. For a short time, a posting to Malta meant the young couple could enjoy a relatively normal life. Their first child, Charles, was born in 1948, followed by a sister, Anne, who arrived in 1950. But the King, having suffered considerable stress during the war years, was terminally ill with lung cancer, brought about by a lifetime of heavy smoking. In January 1952, Elizabeth, then 25, set off with Philip for an overseas tour. The King, against medical advice, went to the airport to see the couple off. It was to be the last time Elizabeth would see her father. Elizabeth heard of the death of the King while staying at a game lodge in Kenya and the new Queen immediately returned to London. ""In a way, I didn't have an apprenticeship,"" she later recalled. ""My father died much too young, so it was all a very sudden kind of taking on and making the best job you can."" Her Coronation in June 1953 was televised, despite the opposition of Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and millions gathered around TV sets, many of them for the first time, to watch as Queen Elizabeth II made her oath. With Britain still enduring post-war austerity, commentators saw the Coronation as the dawn of a new Elizabethan age. World War Two had served to hasten the end of the British Empire, and by the time the new Queen set off on a lengthy tour of the Commonwealth in November 1953, many former British possessions, including India, had gained independence. Her Coronation was the first to be broadcast live on British TV Elizabeth became the first reigning monarch to visit Australia and New Zealand. It was estimated that three-quarters of Australians turned out to see her in person. Throughout the 1950s, more countries hauled down the union flag and the former colonies and dominions now came together as a voluntary family of nations. Many politicians felt that the new Commonwealth could become a counter to the newly emerging European Economic Community and, to some extent, British policy turned away from the Continent. Her visit to the US in 1957 was just one of many overseas tours But the decline of British influence was hastened by the Suez debacle in 1956, when it became clear that the Commonwealth lacked the collective will to act together in times of crisis. The decision to send British troops to try to prevent Egypt's threatened nationalisation of the Suez Canal ended in an ignominious withdrawal and brought about the resignation of Prime Minister Anthony Eden. This embroiled the Queen in a political crisis. The Conservative Party had no mechanism for electing a new leader and, after a series of consultations, the Queen invited Harold Macmillan to form a new government. The Queen also found herself the subject of a personal attack by the writer Lord Altrincham. In a magazine article, he claimed her court was ""too British"" and ""upper-class"" and accused her of being unable to make a simple speech without a written text. His remarks caused a furore in the press and Lord Altrincham was physically attacked in the street by a member of the League of Empire Loyalists. Nevertheless, the incident demonstrated that British society and attitudes to the monarchy were changing fast and old certainties were being questioned. Encouraged by her husband, notoriously impatient with the court's stuffiness, the Queen began to adapt to the new order. The practice of receiving debutantes at court was abolished and the term ""the Monarchy"" was gradually replaced by ""the Royal Family"". The Queen was once more at the centre of a political row when in 1963, Harold Macmillan stood down as prime minister. With the Conservative Party still to set up a system for choosing a new leader, she followed his advice to appoint the Earl of Home in his place. It was a difficult time for the Queen. The hallmark of her reign was constitutional correctness, and a further separation of the monarchy from the government of the day. She took seriously her rights to be informed, to advise and to warn - but did not seek to step beyond them. It was to be the last time she would be put in such a position. The Conservatives finally did away with the tradition that new party leaders just ""emerged"", and a proper system was put in place. The documentary Royal Family gave an unprecedented look behind the public face of the monarchy By the late 1960s, Buckingham Palace had decided that it needed to take a positive step to show the Royal Family in a far less formal and more approachable way. The result was a ground-breaking documentary, Royal Family. The BBC was allowed to film the Windsors at home. There were pictures of the family at a barbecue, decorating the Christmas tree, taking their children for a drive - all ordinary activities, but never seen before. Critics claimed that Richard Cawston's film destroyed the mystique of the royals by showing them to be ordinary people, including scenes of the Duke of Edinburgh barbecuing sausages in the grounds at Balmoral. But the film echoed the more relaxed mood of the times and did much to restore public support for the monarchy. By 1977, the Silver Jubilee was celebrated with genuine enthusiasm in street parties and in ceremonies across the kingdom. The monarchy seemed secure in the public's affection and much of that was down to the Queen herself. Two years later, Britain had, in Margaret Thatcher, its first woman prime minister. Relations between the female head of state and female head of government were sometimes said to have been awkward. One difficult area was the Queen's devotion to the Commonwealth, of which she was head. The Queen knew the leaders of Africa well and was sympathetic to their cause. She was reported to have found Thatcher's attitude and confrontational style ""puzzling"", not least over the prime minister's opposition to sanctions against apartheid South Africa. Year by year, the Queen's public duties continued. After the Gulf War in 1991, she went to the United States to become the first British monarch to address a joint session of Congress. President George HW Bush said she had been ""freedom's friend for as long as we can remember"". The Windsor Castle fire contributed to the Queen's ""annus horribilis"" However, a year later, a series of scandals and disasters began to affect the Royal Family. The Queen's second son, the Duke of York, and his wife Sarah separated, while Princess Anne's marriage to Mark Phillips ended in divorce. Then the Prince and Princess of Wales were revealed to be deeply unhappy and eventually split up. The year culminated in a huge fire at the Queen's favourite residence, Windsor Castle. It seemed a grimly appropriate symbol of a royal house in trouble. It was not helped by a public row over whether the taxpayer, or the Queen, should foot the bill for the repairs. The Queen described 1992 as her ""annus horribilis"" and, in a speech in the City of London, appeared to concede the need for a more open monarchy in return for a less hostile media. ""No institution, city, monarchy, whatever, should expect to be free from the scrutiny of those who give it their loyalty and support, not to mention those who don't. But we are all part of the same fabric of our national society and that scrutiny can be just as effective if it is made with a measure of gentleness, good humour and understanding."" The institution of monarchy was very much on the defensive. Buckingham Palace was opened to visitors to raise money to pay for the repairs at Windsor and it was announced that the Queen and the Prince of Wales would pay tax on investment income. The Queen was committed to the Commonwealth throughout her reign Abroad, the hopes for the Commonwealth, so high early in her reign, had not been fulfilled. Britain had turned its back on its old partners with new arrangements in Europe. The Queen still saw value in the Commonwealth and was deeply gratified when South Africa, where she had come of age, at last threw apartheid aside. She celebrated with a visit in March 1995. At home, the Queen sought to maintain the dignity of the monarchy while public debate continued on whether the institution had any future. The Queen faced criticism after the death of Diana, Princess of Wales As Britain struggled to find a new destiny, she tried to remain a reassuring figure, and with a sudden smile could lighten a solemn moment. The role she valued above all was that of symbol of the nation. However, the monarchy was shaken and the Queen herself attracted unusual criticism after the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, in a car accident in Paris in August 1997. As the public crowded around the palaces in London with tributes of flowers, the Queen seemed reluctant to provide the focus that she had always tried to do during great national moments. Many of her critics failed to understand that she was from a generation that recoiled from the almost hysterical displays of public mourning that typified the aftermath of the princess's death. She also felt as a caring grandmother that she needed to comfort Diana's sons in the privacy of the family circle. Eventually, she made a live broadcast, paying tribute to her daughter-in-law and making a commitment that the monarchy would adapt. The deaths of the Queen Mother and Princess Margaret, in the Queen's Golden Jubilee year, 2002, cast a shadow over nationwide celebrations of her reign. But despite this, and the recurring debate over the future of the monarchy, a million people crowded into The Mall, in front of Buckingham Palace, on the evening of the jubilee. The wedding of Prince William to Catherine Middleton was a happy occasion In April 2006, thousands of well-wishers lined the streets of Windsor as the Queen performed an informal walkabout on her 80th birthday. And in November 2007, she and Prince Philip celebrated 60 years of marriage with a service attended by 2,000 people at Westminster Abbey. There was yet another happy occasion in April 2011 when the Queen attended the wedding of her grandson, William, Duke of Cambridge, to Catherine Middleton. In May that year she became the first British monarch to make an official visit to the Irish Republic, an event of great historical significance. In a speech, which she began in Irish, she called for forbearance and conciliation and referred to ""things we wish had been done differently or not at all"". A year later, on a visit to Northern Ireland as part of the Diamond Jubilee celebrations, she shook hands with the former IRA commander Martin McGuinness. It was a poignant moment for a monarch whose much-loved cousin, Lord Louis Mountbatten, had been killed by an IRA bomb in 1979. Her handshake with Martin McGuinness was a landmark moment The Diamond Jubilee brought hundreds of thousands of people on to the streets and culminated in a weekend of celebrations in London. The referendum on Scottish independence, in September 2014, was a testing time for the Queen. Few had forgotten her speech to Parliament in 1977 in which she made clear her commitment to a United Kingdom. ""I number kings and queens of England and of Scotland, and princes of Wales among my ancestors and so I can readily understand these aspirations. But I cannot forget that I was crowned Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland."" In a remark to well-wishers at Balmoral on the eve of the Scottish referendum, which was overheard, she said she hoped people would think very carefully about the future. Once the result of the vote was known, her public statement underlined the relief she felt that the Union was still intact, although recognising that the political landscape had changed. ""Now, as we move forward, we should remember that despite the range of views that have been expressed, we have in common an enduring love of Scotland, which is one of the things that helps to unite us all."" In later years the Queen withdrew from much of public life though she appeared on the balcony at Buckingham Palace for her Platinum Jubilee in 2022 On 9 September 2015 she became the longest reigning monarch in British history, surpassing the reign of her great-great-grandmother Queen Victoria. In typical style she refused to make any fuss saying the title was ""not one to which I have ever aspired"". Less than a year later, in April 2016, she celebrated her 90th birthday. She continued with her public duties, often alone after the retirement of the Duke of Edinburgh in 2017. There were continued strains on the family - including her husband's car accident, the Duke of York's ill-judged friendship with convicted American businessman Jeffrey Epstein and Prince Harry's growing disillusionment with life in the royal family. These were unsettling moments, presided over by a monarch who demonstrated that she was still firmly in control. There was also the death of Prince Philip in April 2021, in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, and her Platinum Jubilee a year later. Although the monarchy might not have been as strong at the end of the Queen's reign as it was at the start, she was determined that it should continue to command a place of affection and respect in the hearts of the British people. On the occasion of her Silver Jubilee, she recalled the pledge she had made on a visit to South Africa 30 years before. ""When I was 21, I pledged my life to the service of our people and I asked for God's help to make good that vow. Although that vow was made in my salad days, when I was green in judgement, I do not regret, or retract, one word of it."" The British Monarchy Â© 2025 BBC.

"Queen Elizabeth II lived her life in the spotlight. We look back at her reign, from baby to heir to Britain's longest-reigning monarch.

Charles and Diana had two sons, William and Harry, before divorcing. Diana died in a car accident in Paris in 1997 During her Christmas speech the Queen described 1992 as her ""annus horribilis"", expressing sorrow at a year which saw the break-up of three of her children's marriages and a fire at Windsor Castle Public opinion was against the government paying for repairs to the castle. The monarchy was on the defensive, and Buckingham Palace was opened to visitors in order to raise the funds. The Queen fired the last shot on a standard SA80 rifle with the Army Rifle Association at Bisley After the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, in 1997, the Queen faced criticism for not appearing in public.

"This is the moment history stops; for a minute, an hour, for a day or a week; this is the moment history stops. Across a life and reign, two moments from two very different eras illuminate the thread that bound the many decades together. At each a chair, a desk, a microphone, a speech. In each, that high-pitched voice, those clipped precise vowels, that slight hesitation about public speaking that would never quite seem to leave her. One moment is sun-dappled, though the British people were suffering through a terrible post-war winter. A young woman, barely more than a girl really, sits straight-backed, her dark hair pulled up, two strings of pearls around her neck. Her youthful skin is flawless, she is very beautiful. A life opens out ahead of her. She pledges that life to her audience around the world. She tells them: ""I shall not have the strength to carry out this resolution alone."" And she asks for their company in the years to come. Two moments from two eras - the Queen makes a broadcast on her 21st birthday, top, and on the 75th anniversary of the end of the Second World War in Europe The other speech is more formal. More than seven decades later, on the 75th anniversary of the day the war in Europe ended, she sits behind a desk, a picture of her father, the late King, in uniform, to her right. Her hair - still pulled up - is white now. She wears a blue dress, two brooches, three strings of pearls. The many decades have left their mark, but her eyes still sparkle and her voice is still clear. The desk is practically empty but for the photo and to the right, in the foreground, a dark khaki cap, with a badge on its front. ""All had a part to play,"" she says of a long-ago war. The cap belonged to Second Subaltern Windsor, of the Auxiliary Territorial Service; the young Princess Elizabeth nagged her adoring father to allow her to join, so she could serve in uniform, even as the war that defined her - and for many decades her nation - drew to an end. Now, 75 years on, the cap has pride of place as she speaks to the nation on the anniversary of a great and heroic victory. Service to the UK military - inspecting Grenadier Guards in 1952, and RAF crews in 1957 The cap is a simple reminder of what she admired most - service: the service she offered that golden day decades beforehand, the service she saw in her formative years as nation, Commonwealth and Empire gave life and limb so that others could be free; the service that she believed lay at the heart of the Crown she inherited and devoted her long life to. Three decades on from that vow of service, she would allow herself a rare moment of public introspection; ""Although that vow was made 'in my salad days when I was green in judgement',"" she told the Guildhall on her Silver Jubilee, ""I do not regret or retract one word of it."" Over the decades she spoke little, and revealed even less, about herself in public. She - a child of the broadcast age - never gave an interview. Once or twice she would be filmed ""in conversation"" with a trusted friend, talking amicably about something uncontroversial, like the royal jewellery collection. Her words would be scoured for a hint of controversy or an opening into her character. But she was too careful - and her friends too loyal - for anything important to slip out. She did not neglect the medium that came of age as she did. It was her decision to allow her coronation to be televised, her decision to televise the Christmas Broadcast, her decision to speak live to the nation after the death of Diana, Princess of Wales. ""I have to be seen to be believed,"" she would say. Service to the nation - being crowned in 1953, and with then Prime Minister Edward Heath at a concert in 1973 Broadcast and newspaper coverage, the endless pictures of her in well-chosen gowns and dresses - these were part of what it was to be Queen, part of the job she had pledged her life to. Talking about her feelings publicly was not. And she came from a generation - and from a nation -  that did not feel the need to share its feelings. The nation would change. She would not. Here fate and character would collide. It was her fate to take the Crown as the country moved into far-reaching change. But the Queen was open about her liking for tradition, for the ways things had always been done, and her dislike of change. Her heart was in the countryside, and there, with horses and dogs and amongst those who loved animals as she did, was the reassurance of a place that changed incrementally, if at all. ""I find that one of the sad things,"" she would say in the late 1980s, is ""that people don't take on jobs for life, they try different things the whole time."" Monarch and monarchy fitted hand-in-glove; a sovereign who relished tradition leading an institution established upon it. A life-long love of the countryside - in Windsor Great Park with Prince Charles and Princess Anne in 1956, and with Prince Philip at a farm on the Balmoral Estate in Scotland in 1972 Beyond the palace gates, a whirlwind of change would transform Britain. She came to the throne at a tipping point in British history. Victorious in - but exhausted by - war, the country was no longer a global, military or economic power. The rise of trade unions, the collective provision of services and the creation of a universal welfare state signalled a sea-change in the organisation of state and economy. The stately withdrawal from Empire became a hurried exit. As her reign progressed, the old order - Church and aristocracy, the gradations of class and knowing your place - crumbled. Financial success and celebrity overtook accident of birth as a measure of societal achievement. Consumer goods - fridges, washing machines, televisions and vacuum cleaners - transformed homes and social lives. Women joined the workforce; old working-class communities were swept away with the slums that housed them; a society once cohesive and homogeneous became mobile, atomised and diverse, uprooted from old certainties and loyalties. There was some change at the Palace too, especially early in the reign - the end of the debutante ""season"" would mean the daughters of the ""best"" families would no longer be presented at court, fresh faces were seen among those invited to lunch and dinner, and television meant Britons could see their Queen and how she lived - first for the Christmas broadcast, then for a full-length documentary in the late 1960s. But this was change with a very small ""c""; as her seventh decade on the throne drew to a close, the rhythm of the monarchy remained one which would be recognisable from the first, one which her father or even her grandfather would be unsurprised by: Christmas and New year at Sandringham, Easter at Windsor, the long summer break in Balmoral, Trooping the Colour, Royal Ascot, the Investitures, the Changing of the Guard, Remembrance Sunday. Changing times - riding the London Underground in 1969, and preparing to deliver her televised Christmas message in 1967, the first to be delivered in colour When change pressed in all around, she resisted. Her fate was to inherit the crown as the country stood on the cusp of change, and to reign as change swirled around the palace. Her character dictated that she would not change with it, would not bend to fashion. That resistance, that deep appreciation - love, even -  of tradition, was her greatest strength, and led to perhaps her greatest test and gravest crisis, as her family unravelled. Family always came second to the Crown. When her first two children, Prince Charles and Princess Anne, were little more than toddlers, they were left behind - as she and her sister Princess Margaret had been left behind by their parents two decades earlier - as the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh went on a six-month world tour. She was not an unfeeling mother, but she was a remote one. The Crown and its responsibilities had come to her when she was just 25, and she took those responsibilities very seriously. Many decisions about the children were delegated to the duke. Three of her four children's marriages would end in divorce. She believed in marriage, it was part of her Christian faith and her understanding of what knitted society together. ""Divorce and separation,"" she once said, ""are responsible for some of the darkest evils in our society today."" No doubt that view, held by many in the late 1940s, mellowed as the years went by. But no parent relishes seeing their child's marriage fail. The Queen's self-proclaimed ""annus horribilis"" in 1992 saw the separation of the Duke and Duchess of York, the divorce of Princess Anne and Captain Mark Phillips and the separation of the Prince and Princess of Wales. ""A low point in her life,"" wrote one biographer, not because of what had led to the rare public admission of tough times, ""but because of the lack of gratitude, even derision, with which her 40 years of dedication appeared to have been crowned."" Her first decade had passed in a dazzle of adulation, at home and abroad. Vast crowds turned out for her on international tours. Back home, some proclaimed a new Elizabethan Age, although the Queen was clever enough to immediately disavow it. Family time and personal loss - with Prince Philip and their four children in 1972, and looking at fire damage to Windsor Castle in 1992 The 1960s saw a slow cooling off - the Queen was more involved with her family, the novelty of a new monarch had passed, the generation of the post-war baby boom now coming of age was gripped by different passions than their parents. The 1970s and 80s saw no let-up in her service, but the focus of some Royalty enthusiasts - and the media - shifted to her children, their marriages and their partners. By the mid-90s, the monarchy seemed to some to be out of touch with the popular mood; in the newspaper comment columns there was direct criticism of the Queen, and contemplation of the monarchy's future. Her reign at times seemed associated with another epoch. What was her place - and the monarchy's - in the new ""Cool Britannia"" and the informal style embraced by Tony Blair? How did the Palace - repository of tradition - fit in with the popular demand for change expressed in Labour's crushing election victory? Just months after that victory, one hot August night in Paris, came the death of Diana, Princess of Wales. A broiling carpet of flowers soon stretched out in front of Kensington Palace. The flag-pole above Buckingham Palace remained bare. Many in the nation found themselves desolate at the loss of the Princess. ""Show us you care, Ma'am"" bayed the Daily Express headline. ""Where is our Queen? Where is her flag?"" demanded the Sun. For five long days, the Queen remained in Balmoral, seemingly unaware of the spasm sweeping parts of the country. Perhaps, as the Palace would brief afterwards, it was to protect and console the young Princes William and Harry. But given her character, that deep dislike of change appears to have driven the decisions taken at the time; Balmoral was not to be interrupted, no flag ever flew from Buckingham Palace in her absence, the Royal Standard never flew at half-mast. It was a terrible misjudgement. She hurried back to the capital, back to Buckingham Palace. She stopped to look at the flowers piling up all around. ""We were not confident,"" one former official told a biographer, ""that when the Queen got out of the car, she would not be hissed and jeered."" It was that bad. Joy and tragedy - the Queen with Prince Charles and his then-fiancÃ©e Lady Diana Spencer in 1981, and with Prince Philip among the floral tributes following the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, in 1997 She had refused to broadcast at first, then yielded, then agreed to speak live. She spoke to the nation, just before the BBC Six O'clock news. She - who had once driven broadcast executives to despair with her wooden delivery - barely had time to prepare. Her performance was flawless, her speech brief but perfectly pitched. She spoke of ""lessons to be learned""; she spoke ""as a grandmother""; she spoke of the ""determination to cherish"" Diana's memory. It was a triumph, pulled from the jaws of deep crisis. The poison swirling around the Royal Family, around the Palace and around the very institution of the monarchy, was drawn. Once in her reign - just once - fate and character had collided with near-disastrous consequences. They would combine more happily in the Queen's international role. By the time of her death, she had not toured for many years. But for decades she was not only a global celebrity like no other, but also a subtle instrument of influence. Nothing would compare to the first dazzling decade of her reign, before television made her image commonplace and her tours accessible from the living room. On her long 1954 tour of Australia, two-thirds of the country is thought to have turned out to see her; in 1961 two million people lined the road from the airport to the Indian capital Delhi; in Calcutta three-and-half million would stand and wait to see the daughter of the last Emperor. Fate would dictate that she would oversee the long twilight of Empire, though not once did the Queen attend a flag-lowering ceremony. Many times in the 1950s and 60s, a member of the Royal Family would stand as the Union flag came down over a former colony, the national anthem playing one last time. A determination that something should emerge from the imperial family which she had pledged to serve, would mean that she would build a new association on the ashes of Britain's imperial legacy. In palaces and houses dotted across the capital and the country, lived her blood family. Across the world was spread her territorial family - a group of wildly diverse nations, vast and tiny, rich and impoverished, republics and monarchies - that she charmed and cajoled and nudged to remember what bound them together, and what together they might achieve. International tours were taken on behalf of the government of the day; they were tools of foreign policy - if not explicitly, then on the understanding that the Queen's influence would be beneficial to the relationships between Britain and the places she visited. It looked glamorous - the Royal Yacht, the Queen's Flight, banquets and galas - and before international air travel became commonplace, it was an extraordinary experience. But it was always hard work, long days and weeks of receptions, exhibitions, openings, lunches with officials, state dinners and speeches given and listened to patiently. Those who have observed a royal tour find it hard to imagine it is any fun for those at the heart of it. A global role - with Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie in at the waterfall where the Nile begins, in 1965, and greeted coming off the royal yacht Britannia by the Emir of Bahrain in 1979 She would rarely take a holiday outside the UK - travelling abroad meant work. Her foreign travel would mark the step-changes in Britain's relationship with the places she visited: post-war Germany in 1965; a liberalising China in 1986; Russia in 1994, once the regime that had murdered her relatives had been swept away. A trip to post-apartheid South Africa in 1995 she would call: ""One of the most outstanding experiences of my life"". President Nelson Mandela replied: ""One of the most unforgettable moments in our history."" And no visit marked and sealed a changed relationship more than her trip to Ireland in 2011. Not for a century had a British monarch been to the south. When her grandfather had visited in 1911 the island of Ireland was one, part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Violent revolt, partition and independence would follow. After World War Two came acts of violence against the existence of the partition border and then, for 30 terrible years, a brutal terrorist campaign in Northern Ireland and Britain against British rule, with harsh acts of repression by the British government which polarised opinion in the Republic. There was never a right time for a royal visit, because of the distrust across the narrow stretch of water which separates Britain and Ireland. With the signing of the Good Friday Agreement and the establishment of a power-sharing assembly, came the end of Ireland's constitutional claim to the six counties that make up Northern Ireland. On her state visit, extended by the Queen's wish, there was no escaping history. In the Garden of Remembrance, in the centre of Georgian Dublin, where all who fought for Ireland's independence are remembered and honoured, she laid a wreath and, unscripted and spontaneous, bowed her head to the men and women who had fought against British rule, an electrifying moment. At dinner she would open her speech in the Irish language, winning nearly every Irish heart. In that speech she spoke the language, if not the words, of apology; ""With the benefit of historical hindsight, we can all see things which we wish had been done differently, or not at all."" Before the Ireland state visit one biographer would write that ""it was difficult to point to major achievements"" in her reign. That judgement would not hold afterwards. The four days of pitch-perfect words and actions helped sweep away centuries of ill-will and distrust. Perhaps no greater single service did the Queen give her Crown, or her country. Ireland had haunted so many of her prime ministers. Her first, Winston Churchill, had spoken of the ""dreary steeples of Fermanagh and Tyrone"" rising again after World War One to bedevil British politics. One of her last, Boris Johnson, would grapple with the implications of the border within the island, and how to square that with the UK's departure from the European Union. All had the benefit of her ear, her experience, her perspective on British and world history. Her job in the weekly audiences she shared with the prime minister of the day was not to lobby for any individual cause, or to try to sway a government one way or another. She was there to advise, to encourage and to warn. And she was there to listen. All her prime ministers could be entirely confident that nothing they told her would escape. So she was the one person to whom they could freely talk who truly understood the machinery of state. For so many prime ministers, so often embattled, this was also a relief, an escape from watching their back and holding their tongue when around colleagues and rivals. ""They unburden themselves to me or tell me what's going on,"" she would say mid-reign. ""If they've got any problems, sometimes one can help in that way too. I think it'sâ¦as if one's sort of a sponge."" Here she was too self-deprecating. Almost nothing broke the confessional silence around those audiences, apart from praise for the extraordinary effort the Queen put into her work. The red boxes containing state papers - in Whitehall she was known as Reader No. 1 - went everywhere with her, to Balmoral, on tour, on the royal train, even winched aboard the Royal Yacht. For three hours a day, her private secretary estimated in the early 1970s, she read Foreign Office telegrams, reports of parliamentary proceedings, ministerial memoranda and cabinet minutes. And she remembered what she read, sometimes catching her prime ministers out with her grasp and her recall. ""I was astonished,"" wrote Harold Macmillan ""at Her Majesty's grasp of all the details sent in messages and telegrams."" Politically neutral, diplomatically useful - alongside former and current prime ministers in 1985, and with then US President Ronald Reagan in 1983 The Crown's political role had dwindled to almost nothing by the time she came to the throne. Two areas of discretion - where she as monarch had a say - survived: who to call to become prime minister and form a government, and when Parliament could be dissolved. Early in her reign, before the Conservatives started electing their leaders, she exercised her judgement, amid some controversy, as to who she would call to form a government when a Conservative prime minister resigned between general elections. But once the Conservatives started electing their leaders, that judgement was no longer called for. And over the decades, the very idea of the Palace becoming involved in such a decision became alien to British politics. The talk around closely fought elections was of ""protecting"" the Palace from having to make political decisions over who to call to form a government if there were no decisive winner. The Queen never had reason to deny a dissolution of Parliament, and it would have been an extraordinary act to do so. She well understood the tightly circumscribed role she had inherited. And the Crown's political voice was almost silent too. Much - too much, really - has been read into what one biographer calls the ""truism"" that she got on better with Labour leaders than their Conservative counterparts. For all the social difficulties there may have been with Margaret Thatcher, the Queen would attend her funeral, an honour bestowed on a prime minister only once before - Winston Churchill. Her personal political belief may well have leaned towards the centre; she came of age at the creation of that peacetime monument to wartime struggle, the National Health Service, and as the state extended its responsibilities for citizens' welfare and education. The strife of the early 1980s - rocketing unemployment, riots in the great cities, budget cuts and the miners' strike setting communities against each other - marked the end of one vision of Britain. An over-enthusiastic briefing by a Palace press officer to the Sunday Times in 1986 suggested unhappiness with the direction of government policy and what he said the Queen saw as the corrosion of the post-war political consensus. It was a brief glimpse into the thinking of a sovereign who believed that one of her roles was to unify an increasingly divided and disparate nation. And twice she stepped - very gingerly - into the debate over Scottish independence, once in a speech in the 1970s and once just before the referendum of 2014. Was this too political? To some nationalists, yes. But it was hardly surprising that she would urge a little caution on those preparing to decide on the break-up of her kingdom. Did her conservative character drive the way she carried out her political role? Perhaps, to some degree. But the last monarch to involve himself in political matters was her grandfather George V. By the time she took the throne, the political role had fallen away. Her institutional fate was to be a cipher, someone who did the bidding of others. That she would have understood from the start. Here, fate and character walked hand in hand. It was this avoidance of any political controversy as head of state, and her refusal to bend the monarchy to the winds of fashion, that enabled her to triumph in the role that would earn her the love and respect of so many, as head of nation. This is the great unwritten role of modern monarchy. This is where, unprotected by tradition and unprepared by precedent, character alone drove her reign. Formal and informal - in a carriage on her way to the state opening of Parliament in 2002, and laughing with Prince Philip in 2014 Her grandfather laid the foundations for a monarchy that served rather than ruled the nation, but spent much of his time blasting birds from the skies. Her father's reign was decided for him by fate: he was thrust into a role he did not expect and wore military uniform for much of his time as King. After catastrophe and criticism in the 1990s, the monarchy's fortunes rose again. As disillusionment followed the high hopes for political change, as cynicism became entrenched and political leaders derided, an uncontroversial and never-too-fashionable Queen became a figure of incorruptible continuity to a nation buffeted by change, disappointment and division. This was the nation's reward for her endless patience, for her refusal to emote in public, to share her thoughts, to lean left or right, to involve herself in fashionable causes or respond to the slings and arrows hurled at her and her family over the many decades. She remained apart from all that not because of hierarchy but because she - with a prescience that still rather astonishes - never engaged in the superficial of the day-to-day, the back and forth of modern life. She understood that the rhythm of monarchy - the traditions and ceremonies, the births and the weddings and the deaths - provided a comfort to those sometimes bewildered by the uprooting of the past, and served as a reminder that the drumbeat of life was shared across class, age and circumstance. And she understood that not everything in national life had to have an explicit purpose, that for a conservative nation in the throes of near-ceaseless change, the continuity she represented in person and in office had a value beyond measure. She, who with intuition beyond her years, pledged a life of service so many decades ago, made the monarchy the repository of much that the nation loved of itself. She could do that because her character reflected much of what Britons like to think of as the best of themselves; modest, uncomplaining, thrifty, intelligent if not intellectual, sensible, feet-on-the-ground, unfussy, a dry sense of humour with a great big laugh, slow to anger and always well-mannered. ""I am the last bastion of standards,"" she once said.  She was not boasting of better manners or finer etiquette than others. She was explaining her role and her life. It was her life and her work to be the best of Britain. This was the service she gave. Picture credits: Alamy, Getty Images, National Portrait Gallery and Jersey Heritage Trust. Â© 2025 BBC.

Born: 2023 Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank's second son was born on 30 May 2023. It is the first royal birth since the coronation of King Charles, Eugenie's uncle. Ernest is13th in line to the throne, moving the Duke of Edinburgh down to 14th place. Born: 1964 Prince Edward was given the title Duke of Edinburgh on his 59th birthday, almost two years after the death of his father Prince Philip, who previously held the title. It was understood that Philip had wanted Edward to take on the title, but the decision was left to King Charles. Prince Edward's wife Sophie becomes the Duchess of Edinburgh and the prince's former title, the Earl of Wessex, has now been given to his son James, Viscount Severn. The couple also have a daughter, Lady Louise, born in 2003. After a brief period with the Royal Marines, the prince formed his own TV production company. He subsequently supported the late queen in her official duties and carried out public engagements for charities. He is14th in line to the throne. Born: 2007 James, Earl of Wessex is the younger child of the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh. He was given the title after his father Prince Edward became the Duke of Edinburgh in March 2023. When James was born, he was given the title Viscount Severn - a ""courtesy"" title as son of an earl, rather than using prince. It is thought his parents made this decision to avoid some of the burdens of royal titles. Born: 2003 Born in 2003, Lady Louise Windsor is the elder child of the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh. However, she is lower in the line of succession than her younger brother because she was born before a law came into force scrapping the system that meant a younger son could displace an older daughter. Born: 1950 Anne, Princess Royal is Elizabeth II and Prince Philip's second child and only daughter. When she was born she was third in line to the throne, but is now17th. She was given the title Princess Royal in June 1987. Princess Anne has married twice; her first husband Captain Mark Phillips is the father of her two children, Peter and Zara, while her second is Vice-Admiral Sir Timothy Laurence. The princess was the first royal to use the surname Mountbatten-Windsor in an official document, in the marriage register after her wedding to Capt Phillips. She competed in equestrian events for Great Britain in the 1976 Montreal Olympics and is involved with a number of charities, including Save the Children, of which she has been president since 1970. Born: 1977 Peter Phillips is the eldest of the late queen's grandchildren. He married Canadian Autumn Kelly in 2008 and together they have two daughters, Savannah, born in 2010, and Isla, born in 2012. The children of the Princess Royal do not have royal titles, as they are descended from the female line. Mark Phillips refused the offer of an earldom when he married so their children do not have courtesy titles. Peter Phillips and his wife announced they were getting divorced in February 2020. Born: 2010 Savannah, born in 2010, is the elder daughter of Peter Phillips and Autumn Kelly and was the late queen's first great-grandchild. Born: 2012 Isla, born in 2012, is the second daughter of Peter Phillips and Autumn Kelly. Born: 1981 Zara Tindall followed her mother and father with a highly successful riding career - including winning a silver medal at the London 2012 Olympics. She married former England rugby player Mike Tindall in 2011 and the couple had their first child, Mia Grace, in 2014. The children of the Princess Royal do not hold a royal title, as they are descended from the female line, but she remains21st in line to the throne.Their father, Mark Phillips, turned down an earldom when he married Princess Anne, so they do not have courtesy titles.

Leading the mourning, the new Prime Minister Liz Truss said the Queen had been ""the rock on which modern Britain was built"". ""Britain is the great country it is today because of her,"" she added. Ms Truss met the Queen earlier this week in Scotland when she was appointed prime minister. Speaking from Downing Street, she said the Queen had been ""determined"" to continue carrying out her duties. She said the nation should now come together to help the new monarch King Charles III ""bear the awesome responsibility that he now carries for us all"". ""God save the King,"" she concluded.

In full: PM Liz Truss pays tribute to the Queen Obituary: A long life marked by a sense of duty Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the country would ""always treasure Queen Elizabeth II's life of service and devotion to our nation and the Commonwealth"". ""Above the clashes of politics, she stood not for what the nation fought over, but what it agreed upon. ""So as our great Elizabethan era comes to an end, we will honour the late Queen's memory by keeping alive the values of public service she embodied."" House of Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle said the Queen had ""exercised a calm and steadying influence over our country"". He added that she had given people's lives a ""sense of equilibrium"" during her 70 years on the throne and maintained ""unwavering devotion to the UK"". He also said she had provided ""advice and the benefit of long experience to 15 prime ministers during her reign"". Parliament is expected to meet on Friday from midday and Saturday from 14:00 to pay tribute to the Queen. All six living former prime ministers have also sent their condolences and shared memories of the Queen. Ms Truss was officially appointed as the UK's 56th prime minister after her meeting with the Queen on Tuesday Ms Truss's predecessor Boris Johnson tweeted that the Queen would be remembered for her ""deep wisdom, and historic understanding, and her seemingly inexhaustible but understated sense of duty"". ""Relentless though her diary must have felt, she never once let it show, and to tens of thousands of events - great and small - she brought her smile and her warmth and her gentle humour - and for an unrivalled 70 years she spread that magic around her kingdom. ""She seemed so timeless and so wonderful that I am afraid we had come to believe, like children, that she would just go on and on."" Theresa May tweeted: ""On the 75th anniversary of VE Day, Her Majesty reminded us to 'never give up, never despair'. ""It was an address that captured not just the national spirit, but Queen Elizabeth's spirit - a sense of quiet determination, of courage, of faith and of hope in the future."" Queen Elizabeth with Theresa May, one of the 15th prime ministers who served during her reign During her 70-year reign, Queen Elizabeth held weekly meetings with the prime minister of the day. Recalling these conversations during an interview with the BBC, Mrs May said the Queen was ""immensely knowledgeable"" adding: ""Many people don't realise how much work the Queen put into her red boxes, to understand the issues of the day, what was going on in government and around the rest of the world."" Sir John Major - who served as prime minister between 1990 and 1997 - echoed Mrs May's thoughts describing the Queen as ""exceptionally well briefed"". ""On foreign affairs, she would often say if there was a difficulty of a foreign leader 'Well, I met him many years ago' or even 'I knew his father'."" Sir John said the meetings were not always serious and often filled with ""a great deal of gossip... those meetings with the Queen were always the better part of a prime minister's week"". David Cameron described the Queen as ""the world's most experienced diplomat"" and said he was ""fortunate"" to have been able to call on her knowledge during his time in office. Gordon Brown said the Queen was a ""compassionate, dedicated, wonderful public servant and nobody will ever forget the contribution she made to our country. ""She was a peacemaker, she brought people together, she listened to people."" Sir Tony Blair - who was prime minister between 1997 and 2007 - said: ""We have lost not just our monarch but the matriarch of our nation, the figure who more than any other brought our country together, kept us in touch with our better nature, personified everything which makes us proud to be British."" He recalled his last meeting with the Queen when he said she had been on ""sparkling form"".

The monarchy was on the defensive, and Buckingham Palace was opened to visitors in order to raise the funds. The Queen fired the last shot on a standard SA80 rifle with the Army Rifle Association at Bisley After the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, in 1997, the Queen faced criticism for not appearing in public.

Queen Elizabeth with the Duke of Edinburgh at a lodge in Kenya In January 1952, Princess Elizabeth and her husband the Duke of Edinburgh set off on an overseas tour in place of the monarch, who was terminally ill with lung cancer. Against medical advice, the King went to the airport to see the couple off. It was to be the last time Elizabeth, then just 25 years old, would see her father. She heard the news of his death while staying at a game lodge in Kenya and immediately returned to London as the Queen. She later recalled: ""In a way, I didn't have an apprenticeship. My father died much too young, so it was all a very sudden kind of taking on and making the best job you can.â Queen Elizabeth II returns to England Welsh politicians will be recalled to the Senedd - the Welsh

""One of the reasons we got them was because the Queen had them,"" she said, pushing a pram with two corgis patiently sitting inside. The Queen was known for her love of corgis dating back to when she was a child, and kept dozens of them over the course of her 70-year reign. Read more abouthow the Queen's love of corgis started a global phenomenon On Saturday, Windsor Castle became the site of a rare joint appearance by the new Prince of Wales, William, with his brother Prince Harry, and their wives. It is a building that had deep significance to the monarch throughout her life - a place of work but also her own private retreat. The Queen's special association with Windsor Castle began when she was a child. 
The then-Princess Elizabeth and her family made Royal Lodge - a mansion in the grounds of the Windsor Estate - their weekend country home. The first instinct of many mourning the death of Queen Elizabeth II has been to leave flowers at Windsor Castle.  At the age of 14, the then-princess and her sister Margaret were sent to the castle for much of World War Two while their home in London faced the threat of being bombed. The castle has been inhabited continuously by 40 monarchs across almost 1,000 years. With 1,000 rooms, 13 acres (five hectares) of grounds and reminders of its rich history amid the gothic architecture, it is little wonder the Queen saw the castle as a sanctuary.

From world leaders to members of the public, people reflected on Her Majesty's legacy. Tributes for the Queen have poured in from statesmen around the world, and on Saturday, the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was the latest to issue his  condolences. On Twitter, Blinken posted a photo from the US embassy in Washington, thanking the Queen for her ""steadfast leadership"" and ""unwavering commitment to service"". Dame Karen Pierce, the UK ambassador to the US, thanked Blinken for the message, calling the Queen ""our foremost diplomat"" and ""active supporter"" of the two countries' ""special relationship"" - a phrase that had been coined by her first prime minister, Churchill.

Katty KayUS special correspondent Queen Elizabeth and Ronald Reagan ride horses in Windsor Home Park in 1982 US presidents wield hard power. They control the
biggest military in the world and its richest country. Yet,
one after one, they would walk into Buckingham Palace and go jelly-kneed. This
diminutive woman reduced powerful presidents to grinning school boys. She traded scone recipes with Dwight Eisenhower, danced
with Gerald Ford and rode with Ronald Reagan. Somehow she managed to find a way to
connect with each of them, not just as a fellow head of state, but as a person. The one president who, according to someone who worked
for him, didn't go into his first meeting with the Queen already star struck
was Barack Obama. Apparently he rather resisted the ""hype,"" as
this staffer put it. But then he met her. And, like the 11 presidents
before him, he, too, was won over. Indeed, the two developed such a good
relationship that the Queen reportedly asked him to come and visit even after
he left office. I'm told that what changed the 44th president's view was her
sense of responsibility and duty - she was, in Obama language, a no-drama
Queen. US presidents often have a keen sense of history and all those years on the throne wasn't lost on them. As a long day draws to a close in the UK, let's look back at what happened today: Charles III was proclaimed kingby the Accession Council in a ceremony at St James's Palace in London.Read more here. In Balmoral, three of the Queen's children -Princess Anne, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward -attended a church service along with other members of the royal family, and stopped to greet well-wishers outside the gates of Balmoral.

The Queen was a big part of the community in the village near Balmoral, says the church minister Balmoral, the Scottish castle where the Queen died, was the place where she ""enjoyed being normal"", according to royal historian Robert Lacey, So it's no surprise thatpeople in the nearby village of Ballater remember her with special affection. ""She was not just our Queen, she was a neighbour - and a big part of this community,"" says Rev David Barr at Glenmuick Church in the village. Alistair Cassie, who runs a hardware shop in Ballater and has a royal warrant for supplying Balmoral with its televisions, remembered being called to the castle to fix interference with the radio. The Royal Banner of Scotland flies at half-mast at Balmoral Castle ""I was walking along this corridor, and who did I meet but the Queen,"" he says. They chatted about her appreciation for the BBC Radio 2 presenter Jimmy Young. The sprawling Balmoral Estate includes dozens of houses, many occupied by estate staff, and Cassie says at times the Queen would appear unannounced at someone's home, asking: ""How are you doing?"" Grant Harrold, a former butler to King Charles when he was Prince of Wales, says the Queen and Prince Philip would sometimes stay at a small cottage on the estate. He says: ""From what I was told - I never witnessed it - she would be in the kitchen cooking away and he would lay the table, so it was very much a chance for them to be a normal couple.""

The sight of Princes William and Harry meeting the crowds together will become one of the stand-out and most unexpected images from what have been sombre days. With their wives, Catherine and Meghan, they greeted people in Windsor, in a way that couldn't have been predicted last week, when the Sussexes returned to the UK. The talk then was of feuds and unbridgeable differences between couples. They were said to be staying in houses close together on the Windsor estate, while emotionally many miles apart. The couple hadn't been seen together in public for more than two years. That all changed on Thursday. If William and Harry were not planning to see each other, they were brought together in ways that couldn't have been predicted.

     here in the capital of Canada, Ottawa. Justin Trudeau and his
     son walked slowly up to Rideau Hall, the residency of the Governor
     General, Mary Simon - she is the representative of the monarch in Canada
     and the first indigenous person to hold that position. Itâs a quiet residency
     just out of town. Wild turkeys walk around the grounds and among the

     commonwealth realms in addition to the UK. A realm is a country whose
     monarch is the King. Canada is one of the realms and today, like in the
     UK, there was an official proclamation of the King. Trumpets sounded, the

"Queen Elizabeth II, the UK's longest-serving monarch, has died at Balmoral aged 96, after reigning for 70 years. She died peacefully on Thursday afternoon at her Scottish estate, where she had spent much of the summer. The Queen came to the throne in 1952 and witnessed enormous social change. Her son King Charles III said the death of his beloved mother was a ""moment of great sadness"" for him and his family and that her loss would be ""deeply felt"" around the world. He said: ""We mourn profoundly the passing of a cherished sovereign and a much-loved mother. ""I know her loss will be deeply felt throughout the country, the realms and the Commonwealth, and by countless people around the world."" During the coming period of mourning, he said he and his family would be ""comforted and sustained by our knowledge of the respect and deep affection in which the Queen was so widely held"". The King and his wife, Camilla, now Queen Consort, will return to London on Friday, Buckingham Palace said. He is expected to address the nation. Senior royals had gathered at Balmoral after the Queen's doctors became concerned about her health earlier in the day. All the Queen's children travelled to Balmoral, near Aberdeen, after doctors placed the Queen under medical supervision. Her grandson and now heir to the throne, Prince William, and his brother, Prince Harry, also gathered there. Obituary: A long life marked by a sense of duty Moment her death was announced on the BBC Politicians pay tribute to Queen Elizabeth II King Charles III, the new monarch Prime Minister Liz Truss, who was appointed by the Queen on Tuesday, said the monarch was the rock on which modern Britain was built, who had ""provided us with the stability and strength that we needed"". Speaking about the new King, she said: ""We offer him our loyalty and devotion, just as his mother devoted so much, to so many, for so long. ""And with the passing of the second Elizabethan age, we usher in a new era in the magnificent history of our great country, exactly as Her Majesty would have wished, by saying the words 'God save the King'."" The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby - spiritual leader to the Church of England of which the monarch is supreme governor - expressed his ""profound sadness"". He said his ""prayers are with the King and the Royal Family"". This video can not be played Queen's death a huge shock to the nation and the world - Prime Minister Truss Queen Elizabeth II's tenure as head of state spanned post-war austerity, the transition from empire to Commonwealth, the end of the Cold War and the UK's entry into - and withdrawal from - the European Union. Her reign spanned 15 prime ministers starting with Winston Churchill, born in 1874, and including Ms Truss, born 101 years later in 1975. She held weekly audiences with her prime minister throughout her reign. At Buckingham Palace in London, crowds awaiting updates on the Queen's condition began crying as they heard of her death. The union flag on top of the palace was lowered to half-mast at 18:30 BST and an official notice announcing the death was posted outside. On the Queen's death, Prince William and his wife, Catherine, became the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Cornwall. The official notice read: ""The Queen died peacefully at Balmoral this afternoon. The King and Queen Consort will remain at Balmoral this evening and will return to London tomorrow."" The Queen was born Elizabeth Alexandra Mary Windsor, in Mayfair, London, on 21 April 1926. Few could have foreseen she would become monarch but in December 1936 her uncle, Edward VIII, abdicated from the throne to marry the twice-divorced American, Wallis Simpson. Elizabeth's father became King George VI and, at age 10, Lilibet, as she was known in the family, became heir to the throne. Within three years, Britain was at war with Nazi Germany. Elizabeth and her younger sister, Princess Margaret, spent much of wartime at Windsor Castle after their parents rejected suggestions they be evacuated to Canada. After turning 18, Elizabeth spent five months with the Auxiliary Territorial Service and learned basic motor mechanic and driving skills. ""I began to understand the esprit de corps that flourishes in the face of adversity,"" she recalled later. Through the war, she exchanged letters with her third cousin, Philip, Prince of Greece, who was serving in the Royal Navy. Their romance blossomed and the couple married at Westminster Abbey on 20 November 1947, with the prince taking the title of Duke of Edinburgh. She would later describe him as ""my strength and stay"" through 74 years of marriage, before his death in 2021, aged 99. The Duke of Edinburgh was at the Queen's side for more than six decades of reign, becoming the longest-serving consort in British history in 2009 Their first son, Charles, was born in 1948, followed by Princess Anne, in 1950, Prince Andrew, in 1960, and Prince Edward, in 1964. Between them, they gave their parents eight grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren. Princess Elizabeth was in Kenya in 1952, representing the ailing King, when Philip broke the news that her father had died. She immediately returned to London as the new Queen. ""It was all a very sudden kind of taking on and making the best job you can,"" she later recalled. Elizabeth was crowned at Westminster Abbey on 2 June 1953, aged 27, in front of a then-record TV audience estimated at more than 20 million people. Subsequent decades would see great change, with the end of the British Empire overseas and the Swinging '60s sweeping away social norms at home. Thousands gathered outside Buckingham Palace after the death was announced Charles, as the Prince of Wales, delivered the Queen's speech on behalf of his mother for the first time in May Elizabeth reformed the monarchy for this less deferential age, engaging with the public through walkabouts, royal visits and attendance at public events. Her commitment to the Commonwealth was a constant - she visited every Commonwealth country at least once. But there were periods of private and public pain. In 1992, the Queen's ""annus horribilis"", fire devastated Windsor Castle - a private residence as well as working palace - and three of her children's marriages broke down. After the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, in a car accident in Paris in 1997, the Queen drew criticism for appearing reluctant to respond publicly. There were questions about the monarchy's relevance in modern society. ""No institutionâ¦ should expect to be free from the scrutiny of those who give it their loyalty and support, not to mention those who don't,"" she acknowledged. Elizabeth Alexandra Mary Windsor was born in Mayfair, London, on 21 April 1926, the first child of the Duke and Duchess of York As a 21-year-old princess, Elizabeth had vowed to devote her life to service. Reflecting on those words decades later, during her Silver Jubilee in 1977, she declared: ""Although that vow was made in my salad days, when I was green in judgment, I do not regret nor retract one word of it."" That same commitment to serving was made 45 years later in a thank you letter to the nation on the weekend of her Platinum Jubilee in June. The milestone was celebrated with a mix of state ceremonies and a colourful festival of all things British, as well as lively street parties. Although the Queen's health kept her from some events, she said: ""My heart has been with you all."" In a moment met with cheers from huge crowds in the Mall, she was joined by three generations of her family on the Buckingham Palace balcony for the finale of a pageant. On her Platinum Jubilee, the Queen delighted crowds by appearing on the balcony with three generations of her family King Charles, aged 73, becomes head of state in 15 Commonwealth realms, including the UK. He and his wife, Camilla, are at Balmoral alongside his siblings, Princess Anne, and Princes Andrew and Edward. They are accompanied by Edward's wife, Sophie, as well as Princes William and Harry. William's wife, Catherine, remained at Windsor with their children - George, Charlotte and Louis - as it has been their first full day at a new school. Prince William drove a group of senior royals - including Prince Andrew and Prince Edward - to Balmoral Prince Harry arrived at Balmoral later to join other senior royals The Royal Family has now entered a period of mourning. In the coming days, much of national life will be put on hold. Official engagements will be cancelled and union flags will be flown at half-mast on royal residences, government buildings, across the Armed Forces and on UK posts overseas. Members of Parliament will pay tribute to the Queen and take an oath to King Charles. There will be church bells tolling and gun salutes as local and national organisations and charities organise ways to pay their respects, with commemorative events and books of condolence. A state funeral for the Queen is expected in the next two weeks. Foreign leaders have paid tribute to the Queen, with US President Joe Biden recalling how she stood in solidarity with the US in their ""darkest days"" after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. To France's president, Emmanuel Macron, she was a ""kind-hearted Queen"" and ""friend of France"". For Justin Trudeau, Canada's prime minister, the Queen was a constant in Canadians' lives and one of his ""favourite people in the world"".

"This video can not be played Mr Mackay said that the responsibility did not all rest on him Former minister Derek MacKay said he takes his share of responsibility for the failure to deliver two ferries for Calmac's west coast routes. The former MSP was speaking to Holyrood's Public Audit Committee which is looking at why the vessels are years late and over budget. He denied that the contract was awarded to Port Glasgow-based Ferguson shipyard for political reasons. Mr Mackay resigned in 2020 amid a scandal over messages to a teenage boy. Holyrood is holding an inquiry into delays and overspends at Ferguson Marine, which is still building the two ferries. Watch Derek Mackay at the Public Audit Committee Overdue ferry sets sail for new construction phase Ex-minister Mackay defends his ferry deal role The Glen Sannox and as-yet-unnamed 802 will be at least five years late when they finally come into service. Costs have risen hugely from Â£97m to Â£250m. There are questions over why the contract was awarded to Ferguson Marine despite concerns over its suitability. These were raised by CMAL (Caledonian Maritime Assets Limited), which buys ferries for ferry operator CalMac. Both organisations are owned by the Scottish government. Anyone who hoped for a ""mea culpa"" from Derek Mackay will be disappointed. There was no abject apology for the ferry fiasco. No finger pointed at Nicola Sturgeon or his erstwhile colleagues in the SNP. Instead the former transport minister was right on message. ""I'll take my share of responsibility"", he said at the outset. But for the next hour, he made clear his view that he'd done nothing wrong. The contract for the two failed ferries was awarded without a ""Builder's Refund Guarantee"", which would have protected taxpayers' money if the whole project failed, ran late or went over budget. But Mr Mackay insisted this wasn't his choice. Instead, he claimed officials asked for authorisation to proceed with the contract - and spelled out ways in which the risks were reduced. There was ""regretability"", he said, that the ferries hadn't been delivered. Everyone agrees on that. But his evidence suggests the needs of Ferguson shipyard and its workforce may have been put ahead of the people who matter more. That's the residents of island communities, who're still waiting for their lifeline ferries. Mr Mackay had not been seen in the Scottish Parliament since he stood down as finance secretary and resigned from the SNP more than two years ago. He finally left Holyrood at last year's election. Appearing before the Public Audit Committee, Mr Mackay said: ""I recognise the catastrophic failure at Fergusons to complete the vessels on time and on budget. That is deeply regrettable. ""What I don't regret is protecting the workforce."" The former transport minister said he did not think there was a political agenda, or that the decision was rushed at all. There was a ""methodical approach"" to procurement, he said. ""I recognise the failure of it but it was made with the best of intentions,"" he said. The decision was about ""getting the vessels built in Scotland and ensuring the future of the yard"", Mr Mackay said. He told the committee that ministers ""don't ordinarily sign contracts"" and it would have been officials from CMAL - who led the procurement process - who physically signed off the contract. Earlier this year, an Audit Scotland report highlighted how the deal was approved by ministers in 2015 without the normal financial safeguards being in place. Mr Mackay said that ""of course"" he was concerned about an initial lack of a Builder's Refund Guarantee (BRG) but there was mitigation in the submission to him, with reassurances. ""I considered the advice, I was satisfied with the advice, therefore I informed my private office to proceed,"" he added. Mr Mackay recalled that one of the key comments in the submission was that Ferguson's was the ""best deal that could be negotiated"" and that the yard had a ""track record of delivery"". The former minister left the committee room through an alternative exit, avoiding waiting journalists. Committee convener Richard Leonard later said the hearing brought clarity to some central issues but there were still major differences in the versions of events stretching back to February 2015. He said: ""We have today decided to invite the first minister to give evidence at a future meeting to help us get to the bottom of what has gone badly wrong with the delivery of ferries 801 and 802 for the Clyde and Hebrides. ""We will also consider any further next steps necessary to be able to report to parliament on our findings.""

"Lloyd Austin told allies their support for Ukraine should be long-lasting The US has approved nearly $2.7bn (Â£2.3bn) in new aid for Ukraine and allies, including $675m in weapons for Ukraine as it battles Russia. Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin announced the arms package at a meeting with dozens of fellow ministers at the US air base in Ramstein, Germany. The aid includes howitzers, munitions, Humvee vehicles, armoured ambulances and anti-tank systems. The US has already pledged about $13bn in military aid for Ukraine. The Biden administration said on Thursday it had earmarked $2bn in long-term assistance in the form of investments to bolster the security of Ukraine and 18 of its neighbours, including both Nato members and non-members at risk of future Russian aggression. It said it would notify Congress of the aid plan. US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken arrived in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, as his colleague urged Ukraine's allies to commit to supporting the country for as long as necessary and be prepared to adapt the type of support offered. In Kyiv, Mr Blinken said that the aid would be delivered at a ""pivotal"" moment during the war, with Ukrainian operations against Russian forces ""proving effective"". He also vowed that the US and its allies would ""continue to exert that pressure until the aggression ceases and Ukraine is fully sovereign and independent"". President Joe Biden wants to end America's ""forever wars"", but he is pumping billions of dollars into one that could grind on for a long time. After six months, Russia's invasion of Ukraine is entering a challenging new phase. Europe is facing a hard winter of high prices and fuel shortages because of the fallout from sanctions against Moscow and President Vladimir Putin's suspension of Russian gas supplies. Meanwhile, Ukraine has launched a counteroffensive in the south of the country to try to break a stalemate on the battlefield and convince struggling allies it's worth staying the course. Secretary of State Antony Blinken's visit to Kyiv was designed to underline that message by emphasising the Americans are committed to seeing this through. For Washington, of course, the stakes are bigger than Ukraine. The Biden administration - and a bipartisan majority in Congress - believes the Russian invasion threatens to rip up the rules of the liberal global order largely established by the US after World War Two. Despite that, President Biden's long game is not directed at a fast and decisive Ukrainian victory. His arms shipments have been calibrated by the fear that tensions could escalate into direct conflict with Russia. Some analysts and lawmakers have described the goal as preventing defeat rather than powering a win, and demanded the president be more aggressive. Others have said a win isn't possible and urged him to press for a ceasefire and a negotiated settlement. The administration argues that Russia isn't serious about finding a diplomatic solution and Ukraine doesn't have the leverage to press for one.

"Two government departments have been reprimanded by a watchdog for not responding to Freedom of Information (FOI) requests on time. It is the first time in seven years the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has issued an FOI enforcement notice. The Department for International Trade (DIT) had the worst response rate across all government departments. Action was also taken against the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS). The ICO is an independent watchdog. Its central aim is to promote openness by public bodies and data privacy for individuals. It has issued this latest action against the DIT and BEIS for what it calls ""persistent failures"" to respond. It said the action comes as it renews its approach to regulating the Freedom of Information Act 2000, which commits to taking action against public authorities with consistently poor performance. John Edwards, the Information Commissioner, said: ""Accountability and transparency in the work of public authorities is fundamental to democracy and it is the ICO's role to ensure that people's right to access information is protected. ""I advise public authorities to take note and learn lessons from the action we have taken today, as we will be making greater use of our powers under the Act to drive good practice and compliance."" FOI consultant Martin Rosenbaum told the BBC this was a welcome decision. ""It is the kind of firm and determined action which has been badly needed to tackle serious failings on FOI in government departments. ""It should make it clear to the public authorities with the worst records on FOI compliance that there are limits to what they can get away with. If the new Commissioner continues to show much greater determination and effectiveness in enforcing the FOI Act, it will make a big difference to improving how the system can work in practise for the public benefit,"" he said. The ICO said DIT was late answering more than half of requests from January to March. The department's response times declined in 2021 despite no significant increase in requests or known resource issues at the department. The ICO said the delays were ""simply due to internal process failings, rather than more significant problems"". The department has been told it must respond to any outstanding requests older than 20 working days within 35 calendar days of the enforcement notice. It should also publish an action plan formalising measures to mitigate any future delays. Failure to comply with the notice could lead to the department being found in contempt of court, it has been warned. A DIT spokesperson said: ""We are fully committed to our transparency obligations and responded to over 500 FOI requests received last year. ""We continue to evaluate and improve our internal processes and will respond to the ICO in due course."" BEIS was told to improve its performance, after it ""consistently failed to respond to a significant number of the information access requests received within the statutory time limit"". BEIS has had a 55% increase in requests since 2020, but the ICO found the department's internal procedures were the cause of many responses being delayed, as well as the volume increases. The ICO said that because of mitigations by BEIS and its positive engagement with the watchdog, it was only issued with a practice recommendation rather than an enforcement notice. But the regulator said an enforcement notice could be issued if performance does not improve. A BEIS spokesperson said: ""We are committed to handling requests in a timely way while managing this alongside tackling the energy crisis and driving economic growth, and we are engaging with the ICO's office on the next steps.""

"A malaria vaccine with ""world-changing"" potential has been developed by scientists at the University of Oxford. The team expect it to be rolled out next year after trials showed up to 80% protection against the deadly disease. Crucially, say the scientists, their vaccine is cheap and they already have a deal to manufacture more than 100 million doses a year. The charity Malaria No More said recent progress meant children dying from malaria could end ""in our lifetimes"". It has taken more than a century to develop effective vaccines as the malaria parasite, which is spread by mosquitoes, is spectacularly complex and elusive. It is a constantly moving target, shifting forms inside the body, which make it hard to immunise against. Last year, the World Health Organization gave thehistoric go-aheadfor the first vaccine - developed by pharmaceutical giant GSK - to be used in Africa. However, the Oxford team claim their approach is more effective and can be manufactured on a far greater scale. Trial results from 409 children in Nanoro, Burkina Faso, have beenpublished in the Lancet Infectious Diseases,external. It shows three initial doses followed by a booster a year later gives up to 80% protection. Trials took place in Burkina Faso ""We think these data are the best data yet in the field with any malaria vaccine,"" said Prof Adrian Hill, director of the Jenner Institute at the university. The team will start the process of getting their vaccine approved in the next few weeks, but a final decision will hinge on the results of a larger trial of 4,800 children due before the end of the year. The world's largest vaccine manufacturer - the Serum Institute of India - is already lined up to make more than 100 million doses a year. Prof Hill said the vaccine - called R21 - could be made for ""a few dollars"" and ""we really could be looking at a very substantial reduction in that horrendous burden of malaria"". He added: ""We hope that this will be deployed and available and saving lives, certainly by the end of next year."" Malaria has been one of the biggest scourges on humanity for millennia and mostly kills babies and infants. The disease still kills more than 400,000 people a year even after dramatic progress with bed nets, insecticides and drugs. This malaria vaccine is the 14th that Prof Katie Ewer has worked on at Oxford as ""this is not like Covid where we have seven vaccines straight away that will work... it's much, much harder"". She told the BBC it was ""incredibly gratifying"" to get this far and ""the potential achievement that this vaccine could have if it's rolled out could be really world-changing"". The currently approved vaccine - made by GSK - shares similarities with the one developed in Oxford. Both target the first stage of the parasite's lifecycle by intercepting it before it gets to the liver and establishes a foothold in the body. The vaccines are built using a combination of proteins from the malaria parasite and the hepatitis B virus, but Oxford's version has a higher proportion of malaria proteins. The team think this helps the immune system to focus on malaria rather than the hepatitis. The success of the GSK vaccine has partly paved the way for Oxford to be optimistic of having their vaccine out next year - such as by assessing how feasible a vaccination programme in Africa would be. It is hard to give a direct comparison of the two vaccines. GSK's has gone through large real world trials whereas Oxford's data may appear more effective due to being given just ahead of the peak malaria season in Burkina Faso. Prof Azra Ghani, chair in infectious disease epidemiology at Imperial College London, said the trial results were ""very welcome"", but warned it would take money to get vaccines in arms. ""Without this investment, we risk losing the gains that have been made over the last decades and witnessing a rising tide of malaria resurgence,"" Prof Ghani said. Gareth Jenkins, from the charity Malaria No More UK said: ""Today's R21 vaccine results from Oxford's renowned Jenner Institute are another encouraging signal that, with the right support, the world could end child deaths from malaria in our lifetimes.""

"The Queen with Joe and Jill Biden last year at the G7 summit in Cornwall, England World leaders and dignitaries have been paying tribute to Queen Elizabeth II, who has died at the age of 96. They have honoured her deep sense of duty and her resilience, as well as the Queen's sense of humour and kindness. France's Emmanuel Macron led the tributes, remembering ""a kind-hearted queen"" who was ""a friend of France"". US President Joe Biden first met Her Majesty 40 years ago and described her as ""more than a monarch - she defined an era"". Remembering his visit to the UK in 2021 as president, Mr Biden said ""she charmed us with her wit, moved us with her kindness, and generously shared with us her wisdom"". ""Queen Elizabeth II was a stateswoman of unmatched dignity constancy who deepened the bedrock of the Alliance between the United Kingdom and the United States. She helped make our relationship special,"" Mr Biden added. US President Biden, watched by his wife Dr Jill Biden and UK Ambassador Karen Pierce, signs the condolence book at the British Embassy in Washington DC Chinese President Xi Jinping offered ""sincere sympathies to the British government and people"" following the Queen's death, adding: ""Her passing is a great loss to the British people."" Canada - where Queen Elizabeth was head of state - has seen 12 prime ministers during her reign. An emotional Justin Trudeau - who has known the Queen for decades,first meeting her as a child,externalwhen his father was prime minister - said she had ""an obvious deep and abiding love for Canadians"". ""In a complicated world, her steady grace and resolve brought comfort to us all,"" the prime minister said, adding that he would miss their ""chats"" where she was ""thoughtful, wise, curious, helpful, funny and so much more"". ""She was one of my favourite people in the world, and I will miss her so,"" he said, holding back tears. Her Majesty met Canada's Justin Trudeau several times, including earlier this year at Windsor Flags have been lowered to half-staff around the world - including at the European Commission in Brussels, Belgium. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the Queen's ""empathy and ability to connect with every passing generation, while remaining rooted in the tradition that truly mattered to her, was an example of true leadership"". Queen Margrethe II of Denmark, now the world's only reigning female monarch, wrote to King Charles to express her condolences. ""She was a towering figure among the European monarchs and great inspiration to us all,"" she wrote. She called the Queen's 70-year reign in difficult and positive times an ""unprecedented and remarkable achievement"". King Willem-Alexander of The Netherlands - who is Queen Elizabeth's fifth cousin - said he and Queen Maxima remembered the ""steadfast and wise"" monarch with ""deep respect and great affection"". Sweden's King Carl XVI Gustaf, also a distant relative to Her Majesty, said: ""She has always been dear to my family and a precious link in our shared family history."" Spain's King Felipe and Queen Letizia, who have long called Queen Elizabeth Aunt Lilibet said they will ""miss her dearly"". And Belgium's King Philippe and Queen Mathilde said she was ""an extraordinary personality... who, throughout her reign, showed dignity, courage and devotion"". German Chancellor Olaf Scholz paid tribute to the Queen's ""wonderful humour"" and said in a statement that ""her commitment to German-British reconciliation after the horrors of World War Two will remain unforgotten"". Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi recalled his ""memorable meetings"" with the monarch during two UK visits. ""I will never forget her warmth and kindness,"" he tweeted. ""During one of the meetings, she showed me the handkerchief Mahatma Gandhi gifted her on her wedding. I will always cherish that gesture."" Saudi Arabia's King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman sent their condolences, with the king describing her as ""a role model for leadership that will be immortalised in history"". Queen Elizabeth II and India's Narendra Modi at Buckingham Palace in 2015 As monarch for seven decades, Queen Elizabeth lived through times of extraordinary change, and this was reflected in several tributes. Mr Macron observed that she ""embodied the British nation's continuity and unity for over 70 years"" and former US President Barack Obama observed that she lived ""through periods of prosperity and stagnation - from the Moon landing to the fall of the Berlin Wall"". Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida expressed his ""deep sorrow"". ""The death of the queen, who led Britain through turbulent times in the world, is a great loss not only for the British people but also the international community,"" he told reporters. Irish President Michael D Higgins honoured the Queen's ""extraordinary sense of duty"", which he said would ""hold a unique place in British history"". ""Her reign of 70 years encompassed periods of enormous change, during which she represented a remarkable source of reassurance to the British people,"" he said in a lengthy statement. Ireland's Taoiseach, MicheÃ¡l Martin, spoke of her reign as one of ""historic duration"" and described the Queen's passing as ""the end of an era"". ""Her dedication to duty and public service were self-evident and her wisdom and experience truly unique,"" Mr Martin said in a statement. He also recalled her ""many gracious gestures and warm remarks"" during a state visit to Ireland in 2011. AntÃ³nio Guterres, the UN's secretary-general, said Queen Elizabeth was ""a reassuring presence throughout decades of sweeping change, including the decolonisation of Africa and Asia and the evolution of the Commonwealth"". In a statement, he paid tribute to ""her unwavering, lifelong dedication to serving her people. The world will long remember her devotion and leadership"". Queen Elizabeth visited Australia 16 times - here she greets excited crowds in Sydney in 1970 Queen Elizabeth visited Australia - another Commonwealth nation where she was head of state - 16 times, the only reigning monarch to head down under. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese noted that many had never known a world without her. ""Though the noise and tumult of the years, she embodied and exhibited a timeless decency and an enduring calm,"" he said in a statement. ""She celebrated our good times, she stood with us in the bad. Happy and glorious, but steadfast too."" New Zealand's Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern, said she was woken to the news of the monarch's death by a police officer shining a torch into her bedroom at 04:50 to wake her up. ""She was extraordinary... The last days of the Queen's life captures who she was in so many ways, working to the very end on behalf of the people she loved,"" Ms Ardern said. Queen Elizabeth with New Zealand's Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern, in 2018 Queen Elizabeth II met 13 US presidents - beginning with Dwight D Eisenhower- during her reign. Barack Obama said the Queen had ""captivated the world"" with a ""reign defined by grace, elegance and a tireless work ethic"". ""Time and again, we were struck by her warmth, the way she put people at ease, and how she brought her considerable humour and charm to moments of great pomp and circumstance,"" Mr Obama, who met the Queen on several occasions, said in a statement. Donald Trump said he would ""never forget Her Majesty's generous friendship, great wisdom, and wonderful sense of humour"". And another former president, George W Bush, reflected fondly on the time he spent having tea with Her Majesty and her corgis, describing her ""great intellect, charm and wit"". Queen Elizabeth with Laura Bush, Prince Philip and George W Bush at the White House in 2007 Israel's President, Isaac Herzog, also acknowledged the enormous change the Queen saw throughout her reign, but said that throughout this, she ""remained an icon of stable, responsible leadership and a beacon of morality, humanity and patriotism"". While the Queen did not visit Israel, Princes Charles, Edward, William and the late Prince Philip - whose mother is buried in Jerusalem - did. ""Queen Elizabeth was a historic figure: she lived history, she made history, and with her passing, she leaves a magnificent, inspirational legacy,"" President Herzog wrote. King Abdullah II of Jordan said his country ""mourns the passing of an iconic leader"". He said the Queen, who visited Jordan in 1984, was ""a beacon of wisdom and principled leadershipâ¦ a partner for Jordan and a dear family friend"". Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky tweeted that it was with ""deep sadness"" that he learned of ""this irreparable loss"". And Russian leader Vladimir Putin who met the Queen several times and once reportedly kept her waiting for 14 minutes, sent his ""deepest condolences"" to King Charles III. ""The most important events in the recent history of the United Kingdom are inextricably linked with the name of Her Majesty,"" Mr Putin wrote in a statement. "" For many decades, Elizabeth II rightfully enjoyed the love and respect of her subjects, as well as authority on the world stage."" Russia currently has heavy economic sanctions imposed on it by Western nations, including the UK, because of its invasion of Ukraine. Prince Philip, followed by the Queen, and Jordan's King Hussein and Queen Noor visiting the Petra archaeological site in 1984 African leaders also shared tributes for Queen Elizabeth - who knew many of them well and, as the head of the Commonwealth, was sympathetic to their cause. Kenyan President-elect William Ruto praised her ""historic legacy"" and said Kenyans would ""miss the cordial ties she enjoyed"" with the country. Kenya, a former British colony that became independent in 1963, was a very special place for the monarch. For a start, it was where she became Queen. The young princess, then just 25 years old, was on holiday there when her father, King George VI, died in his sleep in 1952. President Ali Bongo Ondimba of Gabon, which is one of the newest nations to join the Commonwealth, said: ""The Queen was a great friend of Africa and Africa showed her affection in return."" And Ghana's President Nana Akufo-Addo tweeted that his country had fond memories of the two visits the Queen made, remarking on ""her friendliness, elegance, style and sheer joy she brought to the performance of her duties"". Her first trip to Ghana, also a former British colony, was controversial and there were concerns for the monarch's safety. Five days earlier, bombs had gone off in the capital, Accra, but the Queen was not deterred, in part because she had already cancelled a previous visit when she became pregnant with Prince Andrew. Kenya was always a special place for Queen Elizabeth - shown here alongside President Daniel arap Moi during a state visit in 1983 Â© 2025 BBC.

"Molly McKibben testing the water in Poland before the World Championships begin The paddleboard explosion has been hard to miss. During the summer months especially, no self-respecting beach in the UK would be complete without people pumping up their inflatable boards on the sand. It is officially ""a thing"" but for one young teenager from Northern Ireland, it has become much more than that. Molly McKibben is in Poland for the Stand Up Paddling (SUP) World Championships which get under way on Thursday. The 17-year-old Bangor girl is the first person from Northern Ireland to take part in the competition, and she is the only junior on the GB team. Molly is still involved in taekwondo but her focus is on paddleboarding for now Like many people, Molly first got into paddleboarding during lockdown. The Glenlola Collegiate pupil said going from lots of sport to no sport was a big thing for her. ""I had been playing hockey for school and it stopped. Taekwondo is a contact sport so it stopped. ""Paddleboarding was something you could do in lockdown as it is in the open and you could do social distancing. ""It came at the right time and I instantly loved it. It got me through lockdown. ""Sport was my get away from school work. I have being doing sport from such a young age - I have been doing taekwondo from the age of five."" Molly is no stranger to sport on the world stage - in 2019, she competed in the WITF Taekwondo championships and won her category. Over the next few days, she will be facing the best paddlers in the world in her age group, with every continent represented. The Republic of Ireland has its own Molly - Caoimhe Byrne is also blazing a trail in Poland. Molly travelled to the Baltic Sea resort of Gdynia a few days before the competition to get the lay of the sea. It has also given her the opportunity to meet some of the SUP heroes she follows on social media. ""Seeing all the professional athletes in person is pretty awesome,"" she said. ""They are competing for their country but they are willing to stop and chat and are full of advice."" American Fiona Wylde is a star of the SUP world She was particularly delighted to meet the current world champion, the American Fiona Wylde. They had a lot to talk about - they share a love of the sport and they both have Type 1 diabetes. Molly was diagnosed with the serious condition - in which a person's blood sugar level gets too high because they cannot make the hormone insulin - four years ago. ""It's been a wild journey - the transition from not having a medical condition to having something you are having to control every day,"" she said. ""Once you get an understanding of diabetes, sport is a big help. When young people get the diagnosis, they think: 'This is it, I'm going nowhere.' ""I want to make people aware that Type 1 diabetes is not going to stop you from doing what you want."" Molly will also compete at an event in London next week Her mum Claire, who is in Poland with Molly as chief kit carrier and cheerleader, says the diagnosis came as a shock. ""There's still a lot of misconceptions about diabetes,"" says Ms McKibben. ""It's completely random, can happen to anybody and the fact Molly continues on with her life and does so much with it, she's a good role model for younger people who maybe wonder how this is going to affect their ability to do the sports they enjoy."" Ms McKibben said paddleboarding lifted Molly up at a time when ""there was really very little else"", but she never imagined it would lead her to this point. ""I had no idea there was anything other than just paddleboarding for a little bit of fun,"" she said. ""I didn't know there was racing involved."" Molly McKibben and Iain McCarthy have been familiarising themselves with conditions in Gdynia ahead of their races Iain McCarthy is the founder of Molly's hometown club SUP Hub NI and he is also competing in the championships. He said that prior to Covid, paddleboarding was already the world's fastest growing water sport. ""Covid has just put that on rocket fuel,"" said English-born Mr McCarthy. ""What we are seeing now is a wide catch. ""There's the recreational side, the mental health benefit side, the physical side and then there is the sport itself and that element is not going to be for everyone. ""But it is something that people can do as an alternative to whatever else they might do, or supplementary to whatever sport they might play."" Mr McCarthy said it was evolving as a sport with professional athletes crossing over into SUP from other disciplines and the holy grail for the entire community was for paddleboarding to be made an Olympic sport like surfing and kayaking. He said he spotted Molly's talent a mile off and she has had to train hard to compete at this level. ""We have backed her to do this because it's important for people in our local community to have this experience, to talk about these types of events, to see what they are up against, meet other paddlers from around the world, get hints and tips,"" he said. ""We recognise we are not the greatest in the world, but exposure to this community is only going to help us grow and develop the community back home.""

"Nicola Sturgeon announced a freeze on rent in Scotland earlier this week to help with the cost of living crisis Scotland's first minister has said the public should not have to pay the full cost of new plans to tackle soaring energy bills. Nicola Sturgeon said oil and gas firms should also contribute to the massive costs of the plan unveiled by new prime minister Liz Truss. She also said the proposals meant bills would still rise from their current levels. Energy bills for the average household will be capped at Â£2,500 from October. The support will last for two years, Ms Truss told the Commons, with additional help also being given to businesses, saying ""this is the moment to be bold"". A typical household's gas and electricity bill had been due to rise from Â£1,971 to Â£3,549 at the start of next month. Gas prices have soared this year, largely due to the conflict in Ukraine which has reduced supplies of Russian gas. What the new energy plan means for you How much are energy bills rising under the new plan? Where does the government borrow billions from? Speaking at first minister's questions, Ms Sturgeon described the prime minister's plan as ""very belated"". And while she welcomed the proposals, she said they still meant bills would be rising from their current levels next month. The first minister said: ""If we go back to the spring of this year, average energy bills were around Â£1,200 so people are seeing soaring energy costs because of a broken energy market and the utter incompetence of this UK government. ""As things stand all of the costs of what has been announced today are going to fall on consumers and taxpayers when oil and gas companies making windfall profits should be making a contribution. ""So I think we can see whose side the UK government is on"". Bills for the average household will be capped at Â£2,500 from October It is thought the energy bill scheme could cost up to Â£150bn, with Ms Truss saying that ""extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures"". It will see the UK government compensate energy firms for the difference between the wholesale price for gas and electricity they pay and the amount they can charge customers. Businesses will also have their bills capped, but only for six months. The latest headlines from Scotland,external Read more stories on Scottish politics,external The final cost of the scheme will depend on the cost of energy on the international energy markets, which can be extremely volatile. The money to cover the support will be borrowed by the government, which will add to the UK's already large debt pile - but Ms Truss has rejected calls for a windfall tax on gas and oil company profits to pay for the package. The government will, however, launch a new oil and gas licensing round as early as next week, which is expected to lead to over 100 new licences for the North Sea. The move is part of efforts to ensure the UK exports more energy than it imports by 2040. Ms Truss announced the energy bills plan two days after becoming prime minister A new Energy Supply Taskforce will also start negotiating long-term contracts with suppliers that would reduce the price they charge and increase the security of supply. Scottish Secretary Alister Jack said the intervention by the UK government was on a ""monumental scale"" and significantly bigger than the Covid furlough scheme. He said: ""This support will provide vital help for families up and down the country at this very difficult time. ""The prime minister's package will also support Scottish businesses, as well as schools, hospitals and the other public buildings we all depend on."" But Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said the plan did not go far enough, adding: ""Let's be clear - this is not an energy price freeze. ""There is not enough support for businesses and charities and there is no windfall tax meaning households and businesses will pay in the long term, not companies making record profits.""

"Two government departments have been reprimanded by a watchdog for not responding to Freedom of Information (FOI) requests on time. It is the first time in seven years the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has issued an FOI enforcement notice. The Department for International Trade (DIT) had the worst response rate across all government departments. Action was also taken against the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS). The ICO is an independent watchdog. Its central aim is to promote openness by public bodies and data privacy for individuals. It has issued this latest action against the DIT and BEIS for what it calls ""persistent failures"" to respond. It said the action comes as it renews its approach to regulating the Freedom of Information Act 2000, which commits to taking action against public authorities with consistently poor performance. John Edwards, the Information Commissioner, said: ""Accountability and transparency in the work of public authorities is fundamental to democracy and it is the ICO's role to ensure that people's right to access information is protected. ""I advise public authorities to take note and learn lessons from the action we have taken today, as we will be making greater use of our powers under the Act to drive good practice and compliance."" FOI consultant Martin Rosenbaum told the BBC this was a welcome decision. ""It is the kind of firm and determined action which has been badly needed to tackle serious failings on FOI in government departments. ""It should make it clear to the public authorities with the worst records on FOI compliance that there are limits to what they can get away with. If the new Commissioner continues to show much greater determination and effectiveness in enforcing the FOI Act, it will make a big difference to improving how the system can work in practise for the public benefit,"" he said. The ICO said DIT was late answering more than half of requests from January to March. The department's response times declined in 2021 despite no significant increase in requests or known resource issues at the department. The ICO said the delays were ""simply due to internal process failings, rather than more significant problems"". The department has been told it must respond to any outstanding requests older than 20 working days within 35 calendar days of the enforcement notice. It should also publish an action plan formalising measures to mitigate any future delays. Failure to comply with the notice could lead to the department being found in contempt of court, it has been warned. A DIT spokesperson said: ""We are fully committed to our transparency obligations and responded to over 500 FOI requests received last year. ""We continue to evaluate and improve our internal processes and will respond to the ICO in due course."" BEIS was told to improve its performance, after it ""consistently failed to respond to a significant number of the information access requests received within the statutory time limit"". BEIS has had a 55% increase in requests since 2020, but the ICO found the department's internal procedures were the cause of many responses being delayed, as well as the volume increases. The ICO said that because of mitigations by BEIS and its positive engagement with the watchdog, it was only issued with a practice recommendation rather than an enforcement notice. But the regulator said an enforcement notice could be issued if performance does not improve. A BEIS spokesperson said: ""We are committed to handling requests in a timely way while managing this alongside tackling the energy crisis and driving economic growth, and we are engaging with the ICO's office on the next steps.""

"This video can not be played Mr Mackay said that the responsibility did not all rest on him Former minister Derek MacKay said he takes his share of responsibility for the failure to deliver two ferries for Calmac's west coast routes. The former MSP was speaking to Holyrood's Public Audit Committee which is looking at why the vessels are years late and over budget. He denied that the contract was awarded to Port Glasgow-based Ferguson shipyard for political reasons. Mr Mackay resigned in 2020 amid a scandal over messages to a teenage boy. Holyrood is holding an inquiry into delays and overspends at Ferguson Marine, which is still building the two ferries. Watch Derek Mackay at the Public Audit Committee Overdue ferry sets sail for new construction phase Ex-minister Mackay defends his ferry deal role The Glen Sannox and as-yet-unnamed 802 will be at least five years late when they finally come into service. Costs have risen hugely from Â£97m to Â£250m. There are questions over why the contract was awarded to Ferguson Marine despite concerns over its suitability. These were raised by CMAL (Caledonian Maritime Assets Limited), which buys ferries for ferry operator CalMac. Both organisations are owned by the Scottish government. Anyone who hoped for a ""mea culpa"" from Derek Mackay will be disappointed. There was no abject apology for the ferry fiasco. No finger pointed at Nicola Sturgeon or his erstwhile colleagues in the SNP. Instead the former transport minister was right on message. ""I'll take my share of responsibility"", he said at the outset. But for the next hour, he made clear his view that he'd done nothing wrong. The contract for the two failed ferries was awarded without a ""Builder's Refund Guarantee"", which would have protected taxpayers' money if the whole project failed, ran late or went over budget. But Mr Mackay insisted this wasn't his choice. Instead, he claimed officials asked for authorisation to proceed with the contract - and spelled out ways in which the risks were reduced. There was ""regretability"", he said, that the ferries hadn't been delivered. Everyone agrees on that. But his evidence suggests the needs of Ferguson shipyard and its workforce may have been put ahead of the people who matter more. That's the residents of island communities, who're still waiting for their lifeline ferries. Mr Mackay had not been seen in the Scottish Parliament since he stood down as finance secretary and resigned from the SNP more than two years ago. He finally left Holyrood at last year's election. Appearing before the Public Audit Committee, Mr Mackay said: ""I recognise the catastrophic failure at Fergusons to complete the vessels on time and on budget. That is deeply regrettable. ""What I don't regret is protecting the workforce."" The former transport minister said he did not think there was a political agenda, or that the decision was rushed at all. There was a ""methodical approach"" to procurement, he said. ""I recognise the failure of it but it was made with the best of intentions,"" he said. The decision was about ""getting the vessels built in Scotland and ensuring the future of the yard"", Mr Mackay said. He told the committee that ministers ""don't ordinarily sign contracts"" and it would have been officials from CMAL - who led the procurement process - who physically signed off the contract. Earlier this year, an Audit Scotland report highlighted how the deal was approved by ministers in 2015 without the normal financial safeguards being in place. Mr Mackay said that ""of course"" he was concerned about an initial lack of a Builder's Refund Guarantee (BRG) but there was mitigation in the submission to him, with reassurances. ""I considered the advice, I was satisfied with the advice, therefore I informed my private office to proceed,"" he added. Mr Mackay recalled that one of the key comments in the submission was that Ferguson's was the ""best deal that could be negotiated"" and that the yard had a ""track record of delivery"". The former minister left the committee room through an alternative exit, avoiding waiting journalists. Committee convener Richard Leonard later said the hearing brought clarity to some central issues but there were still major differences in the versions of events stretching back to February 2015. He said: ""We have today decided to invite the first minister to give evidence at a future meeting to help us get to the bottom of what has gone badly wrong with the delivery of ferries 801 and 802 for the Clyde and Hebrides. ""We will also consider any further next steps necessary to be able to report to parliament on our findings.""

"The long reign of Queen Elizabeth II was marked by her strong sense of duty and her determination to dedicate her life to her throne and to her people. She became for many the one constant point in a rapidly changing world as British influence declined, society changed beyond recognition and the role of the monarchy itself came into question. Her success in maintaining the monarchy through such turbulent times was even more remarkable given that, at the time of her birth, no-one could have foreseen that the throne would be her destiny. Elizabeth Alexandra Mary Windsor was born on 21 April 1926, in a house just off Berkeley Square in London, the first child of Albert, Duke of York, second son of George V, and his duchess, the former Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon. Baby Elizabeth with her parents at her christening Both Elizabeth and her sister, Margaret Rose, who was born in 1930, were educated at home and brought up in a loving family atmosphere. Elizabeth was extremely close to both her father and her grandfather, George V. At the age of six, Elizabeth told her riding instructor that she wanted to become a ""country lady with lots of horses and dogs"". She was said to have shown a remarkable sense of responsibility from a very early age. Winston Churchill, the future prime minister, was quoted as saying that she possessed ""an air of authority that was astonishing in an infant"". Despite not attending school, Elizabeth proved adept at languages and made a detailed study of constitutional history. A special Girl Guides company, the 1st Buckingham Palace, was formed so that she could socialise with girls of her own age. On the death of George V in 1936, his eldest son, known as David, became Edward VIII. However, his choice of wife, the twice-divorced American Wallis Simpson, was deemed to be unacceptable on political and religious grounds. At the end of the year he abdicated. Princess Elizabeth, with her parents and younger sister Margaret, at the time of her father's ""very, very wonderful"" Coronation Princesses Elizabeth (right) and Margaret broadcast to the nation in World War Two A reluctant Duke of York became King George VI. His Coronation gave Elizabeth a foretaste of what lay in store for her and she later wrote that she had found the service ""very, very wonderful"". Against a background of increasing tension in Europe, the new King, together with his wife, Queen Elizabeth, set out to restore public faith in the monarchy. Their example was not lost on their elder daughter. In 1939, the 13-year-old princess accompanied the King and Queen to the Royal Naval College at Dartmouth. Together with her sister Margaret, she was escorted by one of the cadets, her third cousin, Prince Philip of Greece. It was not the first time they had met, but it was the first time she took an interest in him. Prince Philip called on his royal relatives when on leave from the navy, and by 1944, when she was 18, Elizabeth was clearly in love with him. She kept his picture in her room and they exchanged letters. The young princess briefly joined the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS) towards the end of the war, learning to drive and service a lorry. On VE Day, she joined the Royal Family at Buckingham Palace as thousands gathered in The Mall to celebrate the end of the war in Europe. ""We asked my parents if we could go out and see for ourselves,"" she later recalled. ""I remember we were terrified of being recognised. I remember lines of unknown people linking arms and walking down Whitehall, all of us just swept along on a tide of happiness and relief."" After the war, her desire to marry Prince Philip faced a number of obstacles. The King was reluctant to lose a daughter on whom he doted, and Philip had to overcome the prejudice of an establishment that could not accept his foreign ancestry. Princess Elizabeth's wedding to Philip Mountbatten brightened the post-war gloom But the wishes of the couple prevailed and on 20 November 1947 the couple married in Westminster Abbey. The Duke of Edinburgh, as Philip had become, remained a serving naval officer. For a short time, a posting to Malta meant the young couple could enjoy a relatively normal life. Their first child, Charles, was born in 1948, followed by a sister, Anne, who arrived in 1950. But the King, having suffered considerable stress during the war years, was terminally ill with lung cancer, brought about by a lifetime of heavy smoking. In January 1952, Elizabeth, then 25, set off with Philip for an overseas tour. The King, against medical advice, went to the airport to see the couple off. It was to be the last time Elizabeth would see her father. Elizabeth heard of the death of the King while staying at a game lodge in Kenya and the new Queen immediately returned to London. ""In a way, I didn't have an apprenticeship,"" she later recalled. ""My father died much too young, so it was all a very sudden kind of taking on and making the best job you can."" Her Coronation in June 1953 was televised, despite the opposition of Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and millions gathered around TV sets, many of them for the first time, to watch as Queen Elizabeth II made her oath. With Britain still enduring post-war austerity, commentators saw the Coronation as the dawn of a new Elizabethan age. World War Two had served to hasten the end of the British Empire, and by the time the new Queen set off on a lengthy tour of the Commonwealth in November 1953, many former British possessions, including India, had gained independence. Her Coronation was the first to be broadcast live on British TV Elizabeth became the first reigning monarch to visit Australia and New Zealand. It was estimated that three-quarters of Australians turned out to see her in person. Throughout the 1950s, more countries hauled down the union flag and the former colonies and dominions now came together as a voluntary family of nations. Many politicians felt that the new Commonwealth could become a counter to the newly emerging European Economic Community and, to some extent, British policy turned away from the Continent. Her visit to the US in 1957 was just one of many overseas tours But the decline of British influence was hastened by the Suez debacle in 1956, when it became clear that the Commonwealth lacked the collective will to act together in times of crisis. The decision to send British troops to try to prevent Egypt's threatened nationalisation of the Suez Canal ended in an ignominious withdrawal and brought about the resignation of Prime Minister Anthony Eden. This embroiled the Queen in a political crisis. The Conservative Party had no mechanism for electing a new leader and, after a series of consultations, the Queen invited Harold Macmillan to form a new government. The Queen also found herself the subject of a personal attack by the writer Lord Altrincham. In a magazine article, he claimed her court was ""too British"" and ""upper-class"" and accused her of being unable to make a simple speech without a written text. His remarks caused a furore in the press and Lord Altrincham was physically attacked in the street by a member of the League of Empire Loyalists. Nevertheless, the incident demonstrated that British society and attitudes to the monarchy were changing fast and old certainties were being questioned. Encouraged by her husband, notoriously impatient with the court's stuffiness, the Queen began to adapt to the new order. The practice of receiving debutantes at court was abolished and the term ""the Monarchy"" was gradually replaced by ""the Royal Family"". The Queen was once more at the centre of a political row when in 1963, Harold Macmillan stood down as prime minister. With the Conservative Party still to set up a system for choosing a new leader, she followed his advice to appoint the Earl of Home in his place. It was a difficult time for the Queen. The hallmark of her reign was constitutional correctness, and a further separation of the monarchy from the government of the day. She took seriously her rights to be informed, to advise and to warn - but did not seek to step beyond them. It was to be the last time she would be put in such a position. The Conservatives finally did away with the tradition that new party leaders just ""emerged"", and a proper system was put in place. The documentary Royal Family gave an unprecedented look behind the public face of the monarchy By the late 1960s, Buckingham Palace had decided that it needed to take a positive step to show the Royal Family in a far less formal and more approachable way. The result was a ground-breaking documentary, Royal Family. The BBC was allowed to film the Windsors at home. There were pictures of the family at a barbecue, decorating the Christmas tree, taking their children for a drive - all ordinary activities, but never seen before. Critics claimed that Richard Cawston's film destroyed the mystique of the royals by showing them to be ordinary people, including scenes of the Duke of Edinburgh barbecuing sausages in the grounds at Balmoral. But the film echoed the more relaxed mood of the times and did much to restore public support for the monarchy. By 1977, the Silver Jubilee was celebrated with genuine enthusiasm in street parties and in ceremonies across the kingdom. The monarchy seemed secure in the public's affection and much of that was down to the Queen herself. Two years later, Britain had, in Margaret Thatcher, its first woman prime minister. Relations between the female head of state and female head of government were sometimes said to have been awkward. One difficult area was the Queen's devotion to the Commonwealth, of which she was head. The Queen knew the leaders of Africa well and was sympathetic to their cause. She was reported to have found Thatcher's attitude and confrontational style ""puzzling"", not least over the prime minister's opposition to sanctions against apartheid South Africa. Year by year, the Queen's public duties continued. After the Gulf War in 1991, she went to the United States to become the first British monarch to address a joint session of Congress. President George HW Bush said she had been ""freedom's friend for as long as we can remember"". The Windsor Castle fire contributed to the Queen's ""annus horribilis"" However, a year later, a series of scandals and disasters began to affect the Royal Family. The Queen's second son, the Duke of York, and his wife Sarah separated, while Princess Anne's marriage to Mark Phillips ended in divorce. Then the Prince and Princess of Wales were revealed to be deeply unhappy and eventually split up. The year culminated in a huge fire at the Queen's favourite residence, Windsor Castle. It seemed a grimly appropriate symbol of a royal house in trouble. It was not helped by a public row over whether the taxpayer, or the Queen, should foot the bill for the repairs. The Queen described 1992 as her ""annus horribilis"" and, in a speech in the City of London, appeared to concede the need for a more open monarchy in return for a less hostile media. ""No institution, city, monarchy, whatever, should expect to be free from the scrutiny of those who give it their loyalty and support, not to mention those who don't. But we are all part of the same fabric of our national society and that scrutiny can be just as effective if it is made with a measure of gentleness, good humour and understanding."" The institution of monarchy was very much on the defensive. Buckingham Palace was opened to visitors to raise money to pay for the repairs at Windsor and it was announced that the Queen and the Prince of Wales would pay tax on investment income. The Queen was committed to the Commonwealth throughout her reign Abroad, the hopes for the Commonwealth, so high early in her reign, had not been fulfilled. Britain had turned its back on its old partners with new arrangements in Europe. The Queen still saw value in the Commonwealth and was deeply gratified when South Africa, where she had come of age, at last threw apartheid aside. She celebrated with a visit in March 1995. At home, the Queen sought to maintain the dignity of the monarchy while public debate continued on whether the institution had any future. The Queen faced criticism after the death of Diana, Princess of Wales As Britain struggled to find a new destiny, she tried to remain a reassuring figure, and with a sudden smile could lighten a solemn moment. The role she valued above all was that of symbol of the nation. However, the monarchy was shaken and the Queen herself attracted unusual criticism after the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, in a car accident in Paris in August 1997. As the public crowded around the palaces in London with tributes of flowers, the Queen seemed reluctant to provide the focus that she had always tried to do during great national moments. Many of her critics failed to understand that she was from a generation that recoiled from the almost hysterical displays of public mourning that typified the aftermath of the princess's death. She also felt as a caring grandmother that she needed to comfort Diana's sons in the privacy of the family circle. Eventually, she made a live broadcast, paying tribute to her daughter-in-law and making a commitment that the monarchy would adapt. The deaths of the Queen Mother and Princess Margaret, in the Queen's Golden Jubilee year, 2002, cast a shadow over nationwide celebrations of her reign. But despite this, and the recurring debate over the future of the monarchy, a million people crowded into The Mall, in front of Buckingham Palace, on the evening of the jubilee. The wedding of Prince William to Catherine Middleton was a happy occasion In April 2006, thousands of well-wishers lined the streets of Windsor as the Queen performed an informal walkabout on her 80th birthday. And in November 2007, she and Prince Philip celebrated 60 years of marriage with a service attended by 2,000 people at Westminster Abbey. There was yet another happy occasion in April 2011 when the Queen attended the wedding of her grandson, William, Duke of Cambridge, to Catherine Middleton. In May that year she became the first British monarch to make an official visit to the Irish Republic, an event of great historical significance. In a speech, which she began in Irish, she called for forbearance and conciliation and referred to ""things we wish had been done differently or not at all"". A year later, on a visit to Northern Ireland as part of the Diamond Jubilee celebrations, she shook hands with the former IRA commander Martin McGuinness. It was a poignant moment for a monarch whose much-loved cousin, Lord Louis Mountbatten, had been killed by an IRA bomb in 1979. Her handshake with Martin McGuinness was a landmark moment The Diamond Jubilee brought hundreds of thousands of people on to the streets and culminated in a weekend of celebrations in London. The referendum on Scottish independence, in September 2014, was a testing time for the Queen. Few had forgotten her speech to Parliament in 1977 in which she made clear her commitment to a United Kingdom. ""I number kings and queens of England and of Scotland, and princes of Wales among my ancestors and so I can readily understand these aspirations. But I cannot forget that I was crowned Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland."" In a remark to well-wishers at Balmoral on the eve of the Scottish referendum, which was overheard, she said she hoped people would think very carefully about the future. Once the result of the vote was known, her public statement underlined the relief she felt that the Union was still intact, although recognising that the political landscape had changed. ""Now, as we move forward, we should remember that despite the range of views that have been expressed, we have in common an enduring love of Scotland, which is one of the things that helps to unite us all."" In later years the Queen withdrew from much of public life though she appeared on the balcony at Buckingham Palace for her Platinum Jubilee in 2022 On 9 September 2015 she became the longest reigning monarch in British history, surpassing the reign of her great-great-grandmother Queen Victoria. In typical style she refused to make any fuss saying the title was ""not one to which I have ever aspired"". Less than a year later, in April 2016, she celebrated her 90th birthday. She continued with her public duties, often alone after the retirement of the Duke of Edinburgh in 2017. There were continued strains on the family - including her husband's car accident, the Duke of York's ill-judged friendship with convicted American businessman Jeffrey Epstein and Prince Harry's growing disillusionment with life in the royal family. These were unsettling moments, presided over by a monarch who demonstrated that she was still firmly in control. There was also the death of Prince Philip in April 2021, in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, and her Platinum Jubilee a year later. Although the monarchy might not have been as strong at the end of the Queen's reign as it was at the start, she was determined that it should continue to command a place of affection and respect in the hearts of the British people. On the occasion of her Silver Jubilee, she recalled the pledge she had made on a visit to South Africa 30 years before. ""When I was 21, I pledged my life to the service of our people and I asked for God's help to make good that vow. Although that vow was made in my salad days, when I was green in judgement, I do not regret, or retract, one word of it."" The British Monarchy Â© 2025 BBC.

Charles and Diana had two sons, William and Harry, before divorcing. Diana died in a car accident in Paris in 1997 During her Christmas speech the Queen described 1992 as her ""annus horribilis"", expressing sorrow at a year which saw the break-up of three of her children's marriages and a fire at Windsor Castle Public opinion was against the government paying for repairs to the castle. The monarchy was on the defensive, and Buckingham Palace was opened to visitors in order to raise the funds. The Queen fired the last shot on a standard SA80 rifle with the Army Rifle Association at Bisley After the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, in 1997, the Queen faced criticism for not appearing in public.

"This is the moment history stops; for a minute, an hour, for a day or a week; this is the moment history stops. Across a life and reign, two moments from two very different eras illuminate the thread that bound the many decades together. At each a chair, a desk, a microphone, a speech. In each, that high-pitched voice, those clipped precise vowels, that slight hesitation about public speaking that would never quite seem to leave her. One moment is sun-dappled, though the British people were suffering through a terrible post-war winter. A young woman, barely more than a girl really, sits straight-backed, her dark hair pulled up, two strings of pearls around her neck. Her youthful skin is flawless, she is very beautiful. A life opens out ahead of her. She pledges that life to her audience around the world. She tells them: ""I shall not have the strength to carry out this resolution alone."" And she asks for their company in the years to come. Two moments from two eras - the Queen makes a broadcast on her 21st birthday, top, and on the 75th anniversary of the end of the Second World War in Europe The other speech is more formal. More than seven decades later, on the 75th anniversary of the day the war in Europe ended, she sits behind a desk, a picture of her father, the late King, in uniform, to her right. Her hair - still pulled up - is white now. She wears a blue dress, two brooches, three strings of pearls. The many decades have left their mark, but her eyes still sparkle and her voice is still clear. The desk is practically empty but for the photo and to the right, in the foreground, a dark khaki cap, with a badge on its front. ""All had a part to play,"" she says of a long-ago war. The cap belonged to Second Subaltern Windsor, of the Auxiliary Territorial Service; the young Princess Elizabeth nagged her adoring father to allow her to join, so she could serve in uniform, even as the war that defined her - and for many decades her nation - drew to an end. Now, 75 years on, the cap has pride of place as she speaks to the nation on the anniversary of a great and heroic victory. Service to the UK military - inspecting Grenadier Guards in 1952, and RAF crews in 1957 The cap is a simple reminder of what she admired most - service: the service she offered that golden day decades beforehand, the service she saw in her formative years as nation, Commonwealth and Empire gave life and limb so that others could be free; the service that she believed lay at the heart of the Crown she inherited and devoted her long life to. Three decades on from that vow of service, she would allow herself a rare moment of public introspection; ""Although that vow was made 'in my salad days when I was green in judgement',"" she told the Guildhall on her Silver Jubilee, ""I do not regret or retract one word of it."" Over the decades she spoke little, and revealed even less, about herself in public. She - a child of the broadcast age - never gave an interview. Once or twice she would be filmed ""in conversation"" with a trusted friend, talking amicably about something uncontroversial, like the royal jewellery collection. Her words would be scoured for a hint of controversy or an opening into her character. But she was too careful - and her friends too loyal - for anything important to slip out. She did not neglect the medium that came of age as she did. It was her decision to allow her coronation to be televised, her decision to televise the Christmas Broadcast, her decision to speak live to the nation after the death of Diana, Princess of Wales. ""I have to be seen to be believed,"" she would say. Service to the nation - being crowned in 1953, and with then Prime Minister Edward Heath at a concert in 1973 Broadcast and newspaper coverage, the endless pictures of her in well-chosen gowns and dresses - these were part of what it was to be Queen, part of the job she had pledged her life to. Talking about her feelings publicly was not. And she came from a generation - and from a nation -  that did not feel the need to share its feelings. The nation would change. She would not. Here fate and character would collide. It was her fate to take the Crown as the country moved into far-reaching change. But the Queen was open about her liking for tradition, for the ways things had always been done, and her dislike of change. Her heart was in the countryside, and there, with horses and dogs and amongst those who loved animals as she did, was the reassurance of a place that changed incrementally, if at all. ""I find that one of the sad things,"" she would say in the late 1980s, is ""that people don't take on jobs for life, they try different things the whole time."" Monarch and monarchy fitted hand-in-glove; a sovereign who relished tradition leading an institution established upon it. A life-long love of the countryside - in Windsor Great Park with Prince Charles and Princess Anne in 1956, and with Prince Philip at a farm on the Balmoral Estate in Scotland in 1972 Beyond the palace gates, a whirlwind of change would transform Britain. She came to the throne at a tipping point in British history. Victorious in - but exhausted by - war, the country was no longer a global, military or economic power. The rise of trade unions, the collective provision of services and the creation of a universal welfare state signalled a sea-change in the organisation of state and economy. The stately withdrawal from Empire became a hurried exit. As her reign progressed, the old order - Church and aristocracy, the gradations of class and knowing your place - crumbled. Financial success and celebrity overtook accident of birth as a measure of societal achievement. Consumer goods - fridges, washing machines, televisions and vacuum cleaners - transformed homes and social lives. Women joined the workforce; old working-class communities were swept away with the slums that housed them; a society once cohesive and homogeneous became mobile, atomised and diverse, uprooted from old certainties and loyalties. There was some change at the Palace too, especially early in the reign - the end of the debutante ""season"" would mean the daughters of the ""best"" families would no longer be presented at court, fresh faces were seen among those invited to lunch and dinner, and television meant Britons could see their Queen and how she lived - first for the Christmas broadcast, then for a full-length documentary in the late 1960s. But this was change with a very small ""c""; as her seventh decade on the throne drew to a close, the rhythm of the monarchy remained one which would be recognisable from the first, one which her father or even her grandfather would be unsurprised by: Christmas and New year at Sandringham, Easter at Windsor, the long summer break in Balmoral, Trooping the Colour, Royal Ascot, the Investitures, the Changing of the Guard, Remembrance Sunday. Changing times - riding the London Underground in 1969, and preparing to deliver her televised Christmas message in 1967, the first to be delivered in colour When change pressed in all around, she resisted. Her fate was to inherit the crown as the country stood on the cusp of change, and to reign as change swirled around the palace. Her character dictated that she would not change with it, would not bend to fashion. That resistance, that deep appreciation - love, even -  of tradition, was her greatest strength, and led to perhaps her greatest test and gravest crisis, as her family unravelled. Family always came second to the Crown. When her first two children, Prince Charles and Princess Anne, were little more than toddlers, they were left behind - as she and her sister Princess Margaret had been left behind by their parents two decades earlier - as the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh went on a six-month world tour. She was not an unfeeling mother, but she was a remote one. The Crown and its responsibilities had come to her when she was just 25, and she took those responsibilities very seriously. Many decisions about the children were delegated to the duke. Three of her four children's marriages would end in divorce. She believed in marriage, it was part of her Christian faith and her understanding of what knitted society together. ""Divorce and separation,"" she once said, ""are responsible for some of the darkest evils in our society today."" No doubt that view, held by many in the late 1940s, mellowed as the years went by. But no parent relishes seeing their child's marriage fail. The Queen's self-proclaimed ""annus horribilis"" in 1992 saw the separation of the Duke and Duchess of York, the divorce of Princess Anne and Captain Mark Phillips and the separation of the Prince and Princess of Wales. ""A low point in her life,"" wrote one biographer, not because of what had led to the rare public admission of tough times, ""but because of the lack of gratitude, even derision, with which her 40 years of dedication appeared to have been crowned."" Her first decade had passed in a dazzle of adulation, at home and abroad. Vast crowds turned out for her on international tours. Back home, some proclaimed a new Elizabethan Age, although the Queen was clever enough to immediately disavow it. Family time and personal loss - with Prince Philip and their four children in 1972, and looking at fire damage to Windsor Castle in 1992 The 1960s saw a slow cooling off - the Queen was more involved with her family, the novelty of a new monarch had passed, the generation of the post-war baby boom now coming of age was gripped by different passions than their parents. The 1970s and 80s saw no let-up in her service, but the focus of some Royalty enthusiasts - and the media - shifted to her children, their marriages and their partners. By the mid-90s, the monarchy seemed to some to be out of touch with the popular mood; in the newspaper comment columns there was direct criticism of the Queen, and contemplation of the monarchy's future. Her reign at times seemed associated with another epoch. What was her place - and the monarchy's - in the new ""Cool Britannia"" and the informal style embraced by Tony Blair? How did the Palace - repository of tradition - fit in with the popular demand for change expressed in Labour's crushing election victory? Just months after that victory, one hot August night in Paris, came the death of Diana, Princess of Wales. A broiling carpet of flowers soon stretched out in front of Kensington Palace. The flag-pole above Buckingham Palace remained bare. Many in the nation found themselves desolate at the loss of the Princess. ""Show us you care, Ma'am"" bayed the Daily Express headline. ""Where is our Queen? Where is her flag?"" demanded the Sun. For five long days, the Queen remained in Balmoral, seemingly unaware of the spasm sweeping parts of the country. Perhaps, as the Palace would brief afterwards, it was to protect and console the young Princes William and Harry. But given her character, that deep dislike of change appears to have driven the decisions taken at the time; Balmoral was not to be interrupted, no flag ever flew from Buckingham Palace in her absence, the Royal Standard never flew at half-mast. It was a terrible misjudgement. She hurried back to the capital, back to Buckingham Palace. She stopped to look at the flowers piling up all around. ""We were not confident,"" one former official told a biographer, ""that when the Queen got out of the car, she would not be hissed and jeered."" It was that bad. Joy and tragedy - the Queen with Prince Charles and his then-fiancÃ©e Lady Diana Spencer in 1981, and with Prince Philip among the floral tributes following the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, in 1997 She had refused to broadcast at first, then yielded, then agreed to speak live. She spoke to the nation, just before the BBC Six O'clock news. She - who had once driven broadcast executives to despair with her wooden delivery - barely had time to prepare. Her performance was flawless, her speech brief but perfectly pitched. She spoke of ""lessons to be learned""; she spoke ""as a grandmother""; she spoke of the ""determination to cherish"" Diana's memory. It was a triumph, pulled from the jaws of deep crisis. The poison swirling around the Royal Family, around the Palace and around the very institution of the monarchy, was drawn. Once in her reign - just once - fate and character had collided with near-disastrous consequences. They would combine more happily in the Queen's international role. By the time of her death, she had not toured for many years. But for decades she was not only a global celebrity like no other, but also a subtle instrument of influence. Nothing would compare to the first dazzling decade of her reign, before television made her image commonplace and her tours accessible from the living room. On her long 1954 tour of Australia, two-thirds of the country is thought to have turned out to see her; in 1961 two million people lined the road from the airport to the Indian capital Delhi; in Calcutta three-and-half million would stand and wait to see the daughter of the last Emperor. Fate would dictate that she would oversee the long twilight of Empire, though not once did the Queen attend a flag-lowering ceremony. Many times in the 1950s and 60s, a member of the Royal Family would stand as the Union flag came down over a former colony, the national anthem playing one last time. A determination that something should emerge from the imperial family which she had pledged to serve, would mean that she would build a new association on the ashes of Britain's imperial legacy. In palaces and houses dotted across the capital and the country, lived her blood family. Across the world was spread her territorial family - a group of wildly diverse nations, vast and tiny, rich and impoverished, republics and monarchies - that she charmed and cajoled and nudged to remember what bound them together, and what together they might achieve. International tours were taken on behalf of the government of the day; they were tools of foreign policy - if not explicitly, then on the understanding that the Queen's influence would be beneficial to the relationships between Britain and the places she visited. It looked glamorous - the Royal Yacht, the Queen's Flight, banquets and galas - and before international air travel became commonplace, it was an extraordinary experience. But it was always hard work, long days and weeks of receptions, exhibitions, openings, lunches with officials, state dinners and speeches given and listened to patiently. Those who have observed a royal tour find it hard to imagine it is any fun for those at the heart of it. A global role - with Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie in at the waterfall where the Nile begins, in 1965, and greeted coming off the royal yacht Britannia by the Emir of Bahrain in 1979 She would rarely take a holiday outside the UK - travelling abroad meant work. Her foreign travel would mark the step-changes in Britain's relationship with the places she visited: post-war Germany in 1965; a liberalising China in 1986; Russia in 1994, once the regime that had murdered her relatives had been swept away. A trip to post-apartheid South Africa in 1995 she would call: ""One of the most outstanding experiences of my life"". President Nelson Mandela replied: ""One of the most unforgettable moments in our history."" And no visit marked and sealed a changed relationship more than her trip to Ireland in 2011. Not for a century had a British monarch been to the south. When her grandfather had visited in 1911 the island of Ireland was one, part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Violent revolt, partition and independence would follow. After World War Two came acts of violence against the existence of the partition border and then, for 30 terrible years, a brutal terrorist campaign in Northern Ireland and Britain against British rule, with harsh acts of repression by the British government which polarised opinion in the Republic. There was never a right time for a royal visit, because of the distrust across the narrow stretch of water which separates Britain and Ireland. With the signing of the Good Friday Agreement and the establishment of a power-sharing assembly, came the end of Ireland's constitutional claim to the six counties that make up Northern Ireland. On her state visit, extended by the Queen's wish, there was no escaping history. In the Garden of Remembrance, in the centre of Georgian Dublin, where all who fought for Ireland's independence are remembered and honoured, she laid a wreath and, unscripted and spontaneous, bowed her head to the men and women who had fought against British rule, an electrifying moment. At dinner she would open her speech in the Irish language, winning nearly every Irish heart. In that speech she spoke the language, if not the words, of apology; ""With the benefit of historical hindsight, we can all see things which we wish had been done differently, or not at all."" Before the Ireland state visit one biographer would write that ""it was difficult to point to major achievements"" in her reign. That judgement would not hold afterwards. The four days of pitch-perfect words and actions helped sweep away centuries of ill-will and distrust. Perhaps no greater single service did the Queen give her Crown, or her country. Ireland had haunted so many of her prime ministers. Her first, Winston Churchill, had spoken of the ""dreary steeples of Fermanagh and Tyrone"" rising again after World War One to bedevil British politics. One of her last, Boris Johnson, would grapple with the implications of the border within the island, and how to square that with the UK's departure from the European Union. All had the benefit of her ear, her experience, her perspective on British and world history. Her job in the weekly audiences she shared with the prime minister of the day was not to lobby for any individual cause, or to try to sway a government one way or another. She was there to advise, to encourage and to warn. And she was there to listen. All her prime ministers could be entirely confident that nothing they told her would escape. So she was the one person to whom they could freely talk who truly understood the machinery of state. For so many prime ministers, so often embattled, this was also a relief, an escape from watching their back and holding their tongue when around colleagues and rivals. ""They unburden themselves to me or tell me what's going on,"" she would say mid-reign. ""If they've got any problems, sometimes one can help in that way too. I think it'sâ¦as if one's sort of a sponge."" Here she was too self-deprecating. Almost nothing broke the confessional silence around those audiences, apart from praise for the extraordinary effort the Queen put into her work. The red boxes containing state papers - in Whitehall she was known as Reader No. 1 - went everywhere with her, to Balmoral, on tour, on the royal train, even winched aboard the Royal Yacht. For three hours a day, her private secretary estimated in the early 1970s, she read Foreign Office telegrams, reports of parliamentary proceedings, ministerial memoranda and cabinet minutes. And she remembered what she read, sometimes catching her prime ministers out with her grasp and her recall. ""I was astonished,"" wrote Harold Macmillan ""at Her Majesty's grasp of all the details sent in messages and telegrams."" Politically neutral, diplomatically useful - alongside former and current prime ministers in 1985, and with then US President Ronald Reagan in 1983 The Crown's political role had dwindled to almost nothing by the time she came to the throne. Two areas of discretion - where she as monarch had a say - survived: who to call to become prime minister and form a government, and when Parliament could be dissolved. Early in her reign, before the Conservatives started electing their leaders, she exercised her judgement, amid some controversy, as to who she would call to form a government when a Conservative prime minister resigned between general elections. But once the Conservatives started electing their leaders, that judgement was no longer called for. And over the decades, the very idea of the Palace becoming involved in such a decision became alien to British politics. The talk around closely fought elections was of ""protecting"" the Palace from having to make political decisions over who to call to form a government if there were no decisive winner. The Queen never had reason to deny a dissolution of Parliament, and it would have been an extraordinary act to do so. She well understood the tightly circumscribed role she had inherited. And the Crown's political voice was almost silent too. Much - too much, really - has been read into what one biographer calls the ""truism"" that she got on better with Labour leaders than their Conservative counterparts. For all the social difficulties there may have been with Margaret Thatcher, the Queen would attend her funeral, an honour bestowed on a prime minister only once before - Winston Churchill. Her personal political belief may well have leaned towards the centre; she came of age at the creation of that peacetime monument to wartime struggle, the National Health Service, and as the state extended its responsibilities for citizens' welfare and education. The strife of the early 1980s - rocketing unemployment, riots in the great cities, budget cuts and the miners' strike setting communities against each other - marked the end of one vision of Britain. An over-enthusiastic briefing by a Palace press officer to the Sunday Times in 1986 suggested unhappiness with the direction of government policy and what he said the Queen saw as the corrosion of the post-war political consensus. It was a brief glimpse into the thinking of a sovereign who believed that one of her roles was to unify an increasingly divided and disparate nation. And twice she stepped - very gingerly - into the debate over Scottish independence, once in a speech in the 1970s and once just before the referendum of 2014. Was this too political? To some nationalists, yes. But it was hardly surprising that she would urge a little caution on those preparing to decide on the break-up of her kingdom. Did her conservative character drive the way she carried out her political role? Perhaps, to some degree. But the last monarch to involve himself in political matters was her grandfather George V. By the time she took the throne, the political role had fallen away. Her institutional fate was to be a cipher, someone who did the bidding of others. That she would have understood from the start. Here, fate and character walked hand in hand. It was this avoidance of any political controversy as head of state, and her refusal to bend the monarchy to the winds of fashion, that enabled her to triumph in the role that would earn her the love and respect of so many, as head of nation. This is the great unwritten role of modern monarchy. This is where, unprotected by tradition and unprepared by precedent, character alone drove her reign. Formal and informal - in a carriage on her way to the state opening of Parliament in 2002, and laughing with Prince Philip in 2014 Her grandfather laid the foundations for a monarchy that served rather than ruled the nation, but spent much of his time blasting birds from the skies. Her father's reign was decided for him by fate: he was thrust into a role he did not expect and wore military uniform for much of his time as King. After catastrophe and criticism in the 1990s, the monarchy's fortunes rose again. As disillusionment followed the high hopes for political change, as cynicism became entrenched and political leaders derided, an uncontroversial and never-too-fashionable Queen became a figure of incorruptible continuity to a nation buffeted by change, disappointment and division. This was the nation's reward for her endless patience, for her refusal to emote in public, to share her thoughts, to lean left or right, to involve herself in fashionable causes or respond to the slings and arrows hurled at her and her family over the many decades. She remained apart from all that not because of hierarchy but because she - with a prescience that still rather astonishes - never engaged in the superficial of the day-to-day, the back and forth of modern life. She understood that the rhythm of monarchy - the traditions and ceremonies, the births and the weddings and the deaths - provided a comfort to those sometimes bewildered by the uprooting of the past, and served as a reminder that the drumbeat of life was shared across class, age and circumstance. And she understood that not everything in national life had to have an explicit purpose, that for a conservative nation in the throes of near-ceaseless change, the continuity she represented in person and in office had a value beyond measure. She, who with intuition beyond her years, pledged a life of service so many decades ago, made the monarchy the repository of much that the nation loved of itself. She could do that because her character reflected much of what Britons like to think of as the best of themselves; modest, uncomplaining, thrifty, intelligent if not intellectual, sensible, feet-on-the-ground, unfussy, a dry sense of humour with a great big laugh, slow to anger and always well-mannered. ""I am the last bastion of standards,"" she once said.  She was not boasting of better manners or finer etiquette than others. She was explaining her role and her life. It was her life and her work to be the best of Britain. This was the service she gave. Picture credits: Alamy, Getty Images, National Portrait Gallery and Jersey Heritage Trust. Â© 2025 BBC.

Queen Elizabeth with the Duke of Edinburgh at a lodge in Kenya In January 1952, Princess Elizabeth and her husband the Duke of Edinburgh set off on an overseas tour in place of the monarch, who was terminally ill with lung cancer. Against medical advice, the King went to the airport to see the couple off. It was to be the last time Elizabeth, then just 25 years old, would see her father. She heard the news of his death while staying at a game lodge in Kenya and immediately returned to London as the Queen. She later recalled: ""In a way, I didn't have an apprenticeship. My father died much too young, so it was all a very sudden kind of taking on and making the best job you can.â Queen Elizabeth II returns to England Welsh politicians will be recalled to the Senedd - the Welsh
Parliament - on Sunday to pay tribute to Queen Elizabeth II. The session, in Cardiff Bay, will take place at 14:00 BST and
all other business will be suspended until after the state funeral. Amotion of condolence will express the Seneddâs ""deep sadness at the death of Her Majesty The Queen"". The Queen officially opened the Senedd building in 2006 and last
visited in 2021 to open its sixth session.

""One of the reasons we got them was because the Queen had them,"" she said, pushing a pram with two corgis patiently sitting inside. The Queen was known for her love of corgis dating back to when she was a child, and kept dozens of them over the course of her 70-year reign. Read more abouthow the Queen's love of corgis started a global phenomenon On Saturday, Windsor Castle became the site of a rare joint appearance by the new Prince of Wales, William, with his brother Prince Harry, and their wives. It is a building that had deep significance to the monarch throughout her life - a place of work but also her own private retreat. The Queen's special association with Windsor Castle began when she was a child. 
The then-Princess Elizabeth and her family made Royal Lodge - a mansion in the grounds of the Windsor Estate - their weekend country home. The first instinct of many mourning the death of Queen Elizabeth II has been to leave flowers at Windsor Castle.  At the age of 14, the then-princess and her sister Margaret were sent to the castle for much of World War Two while their home in London faced the threat of being bombed. The castle has been inhabited continuously by 40 monarchs across almost 1,000 years. With 1,000 rooms, 13 acres (five hectares) of grounds and reminders of its rich history amid the gothic architecture, it is little wonder the Queen saw the castle as a sanctuary.

From world leaders to members of the public, people reflected on Her Majesty's legacy. Tributes for the Queen have poured in from statesmen around the world, and on Saturday, the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was the latest to issue his  condolences. On Twitter, Blinken posted a photo from the US embassy in Washington, thanking the Queen for her ""steadfast leadership"" and ""unwavering commitment to service"". Dame Karen Pierce, the UK ambassador to the US, thanked Blinken for the message, calling the Queen ""our foremost diplomat"" and ""active supporter"" of the two countries' ""special relationship"" - a phrase that had been coined by her first prime minister, Churchill.

Katty KayUS special correspondent Queen Elizabeth and Ronald Reagan ride horses in Windsor Home Park in 1982 US presidents wield hard power. They control the
biggest military in the world and its richest country. Yet,
one after one, they would walk into Buckingham Palace and go jelly-kneed. This
diminutive woman reduced powerful presidents to grinning school boys. She traded scone recipes with Dwight Eisenhower, danced
with Gerald Ford and rode with Ronald Reagan. Somehow she managed to find a way to
connect with each of them, not just as a fellow head of state, but as a person. The one president who, according to someone who worked
for him, didn't go into his first meeting with the Queen already star struck
was Barack Obama. Apparently he rather resisted the ""hype,"" as
this staffer put it. But then he met her. And, like the 11 presidents
before him, he, too, was won over. Indeed, the two developed such a good
relationship that the Queen reportedly asked him to come and visit even after
he left office. I'm told that what changed the 44th president's view was her
sense of responsibility and duty - she was, in Obama language, a no-drama
Queen. US presidents often have a keen sense of history and all those years on the throne wasn't lost on them. As a long day draws to a close in the UK, let's look back at what happened today: Charles III was proclaimed kingby the Accession Council in a ceremony at St James's Palace in London.Read more here. In Balmoral, three of the Queen's children -Princess Anne, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward -attended a church service along with other members of the royal family, and stopped to greet well-wishers outside the gates of Balmoral. Details of the Queen's funeral were announced- it will take place at 11am on Monday, 19 September at Westminster Abbey.Get more details here.

The Queen was a big part of the community in the village near Balmoral, says the church minister Balmoral, the Scottish castle where the Queen died, was the place where she ""enjoyed being normal"", according to royal historian Robert Lacey, So it's no surprise thatpeople in the nearby village of Ballater remember her with special affection. ""She was not just our Queen, she was a neighbour - and a big part of this community,"" says Rev David Barr at Glenmuick Church in the village. Alistair Cassie, who runs a hardware shop in Ballater and has a royal warrant for supplying Balmoral with its televisions, remembered being called to the castle to fix interference with the radio. The Royal Banner of Scotland flies at half-mast at Balmoral Castle ""I was walking along this corridor, and who did I meet but the Queen,"" he says. They chatted about her appreciation for the BBC Radio 2 presenter Jimmy Young. The sprawling Balmoral Estate includes dozens of houses, many occupied by estate staff, and Cassie says at times the Queen would appear unannounced at someone's home, asking: ""How are you doing?"" Grant Harrold, a former butler to King Charles when he was Prince of Wales, says the Queen and Prince Philip would sometimes stay at a small cottage on the estate. He says: ""From what I was told - I never witnessed it - she would be in the kitchen cooking away and he would lay the table, so it was very much a chance for them to be a normal couple."" Alistair Cassie met the Queen on a formal visit - and unexpectedly in the corridor of the castle Crowds continued to form at Buckingham Palace on Saturday night as people paid tribute to the Queen Many took photos at the gates, where flowers have been left in memory of the monarch Six-year-old Penelope is among the people to have left tributes for the Queen near the palace As the nation continues to mourn the death of Queen Elizabeth II, here's what we know about the plans for tomorrow:  Sean CoughlanBBC News, royal correspondent Headline writers will be thinking about ""Brothers in arms"" or maybe ""Brothers in grief"" for their coverage. The sight of Princes William and Harry meeting the crowds together will become one of the stand-out and most unexpected images from what have been sombre days. With their wives, Catherine and Meghan, they greeted people in Windsor, in a way that couldn't have been predicted last week, when the Sussexes returned to the UK. The talk then was of feuds and unbridgeable differences between couples. They were said to be staying in houses close together on the Windsor estate, while emotionally many miles apart. The couple hadn't been seen together in public for more than two years. That all changed on Thursday. If William and Harry were not planning to see each other, they were brought together in ways that couldn't have been predicted.

Chi Chi IzunduReporting from Washington DC A
small group of people were making their way to the British Embassy in
Washington DC to lay flowers and read some of the messages that people had
left. Dignitaries
are expected to continue to make their way to the embassy and pay their
respects. Wanita Harris-Wise was
carrying a small bunch of flowers and wanted to go and show her respects to the
monarch. âQueen Elizabeth was all we
knew growing up. Iâm 64 years of age and when you thought of the Queen thatâs

     here in the capital of Canada, Ottawa. Justin Trudeau and his
     son walked slowly up to Rideau Hall, the residency of the Governor
     General, Mary Simon - she is the representative of the monarch in Canada
     and the first indigenous person to hold that position. Itâs a quiet residency
     just out of town. Wild turkeys walk around the grounds and among the
     trees, some of which have been planted by royals. There are 14
     commonwealth realms in addition to the UK. A realm is a country whose
     monarch is the King. Canada is one of the realms and today, like in the
     UK, there was an official proclamation of the King. Trumpets sounded, the
     doors opened and the Chief Herald walked out of Rideau Hall to announce
     the King of Canada. Firstly in English and then in French, with Trudeau at
     his side, Samy Khalid, proclaimed His Royal Highness Prince Charles III,
     King. Cannon shots were fired,
     flags were raised and Guardsmen marched among the small crowd that had
     gathered.  Tributes for Queen Elizabeth II are continuing to pour in from around the world. Oliver Atkin from Bromley says he remembers meeting the monarch on the Balmoral estate in 2012 while on a family day out. She ""walked straight up to us and said hello. I remember my Mum and Dad introducing us all. She asked where we were going and took time to find out where we were from,"" he recalls.

"Prime Minister Liz Truss has announced plans to cap average household energy bills at Â£2,500 a year from October The support will last for two years, she announces in the Commons, saying ""this is the moment to be bold"" A typical household's gas and electricity bill had been due to rise from Â£1,971 to Â£3,549 in October Businesses are also getting a support package for six months which will provide ""equivalent support"" After the six-month period, further support will be targeted at ""vulnerable industries"", Truss says The government is also lifting the ban on fracking - which involves extracting gas and oil from shale rock Edited by Jeremy Gahagan and Nathan Williams Our coverage of the government's plan to cap energy bills is coming to a close. During the debate, a statement from the Palace saying that the Queen is under medical supervision was released. Follow our live coverage here. With the debate drawing to a close, here are the main lines from
Liz Truss' announcement on energy bills. As expected, an energy bills price cap of Â£2,500 for the typical
household per year, for the next two years, has been announced. A six-month support package for businesses has also been
announced, with further support for ""vulnerable industries"" after
that period. The ban on fracking will also be lifted - allowing developers to
seek planning permissions where there is local support. Read more on the energy announcementshere. Our colleagues atRadio 5 Livehave been hearing views on the government's plans to tackle energy prices from people around the country. Susanlives near a fracking site in Lancashire, she's concerned about the government's plans to lift the ban on fracking. ""I've experienced huge methane emissions, earth tremors and the disruption that comes with a fracking site,"" she says. ""For me, health and peace of mind are far greater value [than cheaper energy costs]."" Susan is concerned about the government's plans for fracking Philip in Croydonwould like to see the government nationalise ""all sources of oil and gas in UK territories"". ""We've nationalised the pain, so nationalise the profits,"" he says. ""If we take control of our own national resources, we could have a proper domestic energy market... we should look after our own people first."" Ronnie in Hemel Hempsteadbelieves there's ""hypocrisy"" in the government's plan to borrow money. He says when David Cameron came into power ""we were told borrowing at the levels being spoken about would destroy our grandchildren's futures"". ""We were told the borrowing [Labour were proposing at the lest general election] they were talking about would lead the country to economic ruin, but when the Tories want to borrow at this level now, it's fine."" Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent The new Prime Minister Liz Truss has outlined her plans to deal with soaring energy bills faced by households and businesses. At its heart is a move to limit the 80% rise in domestic bills that was earmarked for October. So how much will you pay? Will you have to pay it back? And will you still get cost of living payments? Here's what it means for you. Truss' first major decision would be to protect the profits of big businesses, Blackford continues. He's describing the funding for this plan as a ""Truss tax"", adding that the decision to not increase a windfall tax is the worst decision she could possibly make. There is a difference between fair and an excess, or windfall, profits for companies like Shell and BP. Blackford criticises energy generation firms for paying dividends and buying back their own shares with these profits, rather than investing in infrastructure. More now from Blackford, who says the current system isn't fit for purpose and needs urgent review. He says businesses are facing a fight for survival and the UK government needs to grasp the scale of the emergency. In reality, the one big question is how it would be paid for and who would pay for it, Blackford says. He adds the prime minister has made a political choice to ask families to fund it, rather than businesses. Heading back to the energy debate now, and SNP leader Ian Blackford - who has sent his best wishes to the Queen following the news - is warning about impact of high energy bills. Blackford says this cost crisis puts lives and livelihoods at risk, but that people were left waiting all summer Blackford adds the plan that we've finally heard today falls short of what is needed to address people's costs. He says freezing prices wasn't a choice, but the only political option and setting the cap at Â£2,500 isn't a freeze, but baking in high prices. Speaker of the House Lindsay Hoyle has just interrupted
the energy debate, to say he and the House are sending their best wishes to the Queen -
following an announcement that the monarch is under medical supervision at Balmoral Castle. You can read morein our breaking story. Simon JackBBC Business Editor Consumer support is as expected. A typical household will see their energy bill rise to Â£2,500 in October which will be fixed for two years. A Â£400 rebate takes it down to Â£2,100. Additional
payments of Â£650 for those on qualifying benefits will also stay in place. But
there is no suggestion those payments will be repeated so average households
will see an energy price rise of over 25%. Businesses
offered ""equivalent support"" for a six month period but it is not
clear what that means as they have not yet published the unit cost per unit of
gas and electricity that they are using to generate the domestic cap and cannot
yet confirm whether the same unit cost will be applied to business customers. Business will
need greater clarity on this if they are to be reassured. Conservative MP Theresa May says the energy efficiency of homes needs to be improved, as it would not only reduce demand for energy, but would also help to save the planet. We do need to consider rolling out significant home insulation programme, she adds. Former PM Theresa May congratulates PM Liz Truss on acting so swiftly on energy bills. She welcomes the fact that energy bills action has been coupled with action on energy security. ""The vicious invasion of Ukraine by Russia has indeed shown the necessity of us having our own energy security,"" she says. Ione WellsPolitical Correspondent, BBC News There is a real ideological divide between this new Conservative
leadership and Labourâs. Keir Starmer calls Liz Trussâ opposition to
windfall taxes on oil and gas firms âridiculousâ, but the Tory front bench has
definitively ruled out any more taxes. Starmer himself calls this the big
âdivide.â Itâs a contrast to Boris Johnsonâs cabinet â who did end up
introducing the current windfall tax. Britain needs a fresh start, not a government who protect the profits of energy companies and doubles down on fossil fuels, Starmer says as he ends his stint at the despatch box. The change we need is not the fourth Tory prime minister in six years, but a Labour government, he concludes. If all countries took the approach of squeezing every single
drop out of their fossil fuel reserves, that would be devastating for our
planet, Starmer says. Wind and solar are now nine times cheaper than gas. So we need a
clean energy plan, urgently accelerating the rollout of offshore wine, onshore
wind, solar, nuclear, hydrogen and tidal. Starmer says fracking and a dash for gas in the North Sea will not boost our supply in the short term or energy security. But he adds it will fight our ability to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and stick to net zero commitments. He then reads out (lengthy) quotes from Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng a few months ago, where he argued that fracking and North Sea oil would not reduce wholesale prices. Starmer says doubling down on fossil fuels is a ""ludicrous"" answer to an energy crisis, given the threat that climate change poses to the planet and future generations. Need a recap? Here are the main points of the new PM's plan on energy. Household
bills:  Business
bills:  Paying for the plan:  Energy
supply: We're thick into the debate in the Commons now. But many of you will be wondering: what happens now? Greg Jackson, chief executive and founder of Octopus Energy, says: ""Companies and government are now working through the details
and customers should sit tight and wait to hear from their energy supplier. ""Nothing will change until 1 October and we'll be in touch with everyone
before then."" Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent The prime minister said a fund will be created to support
those who are not covered by a cap. This includes people who use heating oil in their homes,
those who have communal heating schemes, and people in mobile home parks who
pay the park-owner rather than a supplier. More details will come later, but this will be an extremely
complex task. For example, people in park homes do not yet know how they
will receive the Â£400 discount available to everyone â and that was announced
months ago. Expect debate over how people get this money, and how soon. The Labour leader says he is pleased that the principle of a price limit has been accepted. But this support, ""does not come cheap"", he adds. The real question before the house today the government faces, the political question, is who is going to pay? The Treasury estimates that energy companies could make Â£170bn in unexpected windfall profits over the next two years. The head of BP has called this crisis a cash machine for his company, and households are on the other end of that cash machine, their bills are funding these eye-watering profits, says Starmer. ""That's why we've been calling for a windfall tax since January, and it's why we want to see it expanded. ""The consequence is the bill will be picked up by working people."" Repeating arguments he made at Prime Minister's Questions yesterday, the Labour leader says Liz Truss is opposed to windfall taxes and wants to leave vast profits of energy companies on the table. He adds the bill will leave working people footing the bill. Starmer says there is no reason taxing these profits that have come about via market price spikes rather than planning would deter investment. He says her argument against it falls apart at first inspection, adding she is driven by dogma. Â© 2025 BBC.

Queen Elizabeth with the Duke of Edinburgh at a lodge in Kenya In January 1952, Princess Elizabeth and her husband the Duke of Edinburgh set off on an overseas tour in place of the monarch, who was terminally ill with lung cancer. Against medical advice, the King went to the airport to see the couple off. It was to be the last time Elizabeth, then just 25 years old, would see her father. She heard the news of his death while staying at a game lodge in Kenya and immediately returned to London as the Queen. She later recalled: ""In a way, I didn't have an apprenticeship. My father died much too young, so it was all a very sudden kind of taking on and making the best job you can.â Queen Elizabeth II returns to England Welsh politicians will be recalled to the Senedd - the Welsh
Parliament - on Sunday to pay tribute to Queen Elizabeth II. The session, in Cardiff Bay, will take place at 14:00 BST and
all other business will be suspended until after the state funeral. Amotion of condolence will express the Seneddâs ""deep sadness at the death of Her Majesty The Queen"". The Queen officially opened the Senedd building in 2006 and last

The Queen's special association with Windsor Castle began when she was a child. 
The then-Princess Elizabeth and her family made Royal Lodge - a mansion in the grounds of the Windsor Estate - their weekend country home. The first instinct of many mourning the death of Queen Elizabeth II has been to leave flowers at Windsor Castle.  At the age of 14, the then-princess and her sister Margaret were sent to the castle for much of World War Two while their home in London faced the threat of being bombed. The castle has been inhabited continuously by 40 monarchs across almost 1,000 years. With 1,000 rooms, 13 acres (five hectares) of grounds and reminders of its rich history amid the gothic architecture, it is little wonder the Queen saw the castle as a sanctuary.

Katty KayUS special correspondent Queen Elizabeth and Ronald Reagan ride horses in Windsor Home Park in 1982 US presidents wield hard power. They control the
biggest military in the world and its richest country. Yet,
one after one, they would walk into Buckingham Palace and go jelly-kneed. This
diminutive woman reduced powerful presidents to grinning school boys. She traded scone recipes with Dwight Eisenhower, danced
with Gerald Ford and rode with Ronald Reagan. Somehow she managed to find a way to
connect with each of them, not just as a fellow head of state, but as a person. The one president who, according to someone who worked
for him, didn't go into his first meeting with the Queen already star struck
was Barack Obama. Apparently he rather resisted the ""hype,"" as
this staffer put it. But then he met her. And, like the 11 presidents
before him, he, too, was won over. Indeed, the two developed such a good
relationship that the Queen reportedly asked him to come and visit even after
he left office. I'm told that what changed the 44th president's view was her
sense of responsibility and duty - she was, in Obama language, a no-drama
Queen. US presidents often have a keen sense of history and all those years on the throne wasn't lost on them. As a long day draws to a close in the UK, let's look back at what happened today: Charles III was proclaimed kingby the Accession Council in a ceremony at St James's Palace in London.Read more here. In Balmoral, three of the Queen's children -Princess Anne, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward -attended a church service along with other members of the royal family, and stopped to greet well-wishers outside the gates of Balmoral.

The Queen was a big part of the community in the village near Balmoral, says the church minister Balmoral, the Scottish castle where the Queen died, was the place where she ""enjoyed being normal"", according to royal historian Robert Lacey, So it's no surprise thatpeople in the nearby village of Ballater remember her with special affection. ""She was not just our Queen, she was a neighbour - and a big part of this community,"" says Rev David Barr at Glenmuick Church in the village. Alistair Cassie, who runs a hardware shop in Ballater and has a royal warrant for supplying Balmoral with its televisions, remembered being called to the castle to fix interference with the radio. The Royal Banner of Scotland flies at half-mast at Balmoral Castle ""I was walking along this corridor, and who did I meet but the Queen,"" he says. They chatted about her appreciation for the BBC Radio 2 presenter Jimmy Young. The sprawling Balmoral Estate includes dozens of houses, many occupied by estate staff, and Cassie says at times the Queen would appear unannounced at someone's home, asking: ""How are you doing?"" Grant Harrold, a former butler to King Charles when he was Prince of Wales, says the Queen and Prince Philip would sometimes stay at a small cottage on the estate. He says: ""From what I was told - I never witnessed it - she would be in the kitchen cooking away and he would lay the table, so it was very much a chance for them to be a normal couple.""

The sight of Princes William and Harry meeting the crowds together will become one of the stand-out and most unexpected images from what have been sombre days. With their wives, Catherine and Meghan, they greeted people in Windsor, in a way that couldn't have been predicted last week, when the Sussexes returned to the UK. The talk then was of feuds and unbridgeable differences between couples. They were said to be staying in houses close together on the Windsor estate, while emotionally many miles apart. The couple hadn't been seen together in public for more than two years. That all changed on Thursday. If William and Harry were not planning to see each other, they were brought together in ways that couldn't have been predicted.

small group of people were making their way to the British Embassy in
Washington DC to lay flowers and read some of the messages that people had

     General, Mary Simon - she is the representative of the monarch in Canada

     just out of town. Wild turkeys walk around the grounds and among the

     commonwealth realms in addition to the UK. A realm is a country whose
     monarch is the King. Canada is one of the realms and today, like in the
     UK, there was an official proclamation of the King. Trumpets sounded, the

     the King of Canada. Firstly in English and then in French, with Trudeau at
     his side, Samy Khalid, proclaimed His Royal Highness Prince Charles III,
     King. Cannon shots were fired,

connect with each of them, not just as a fellow head of state, but as a person. The one president who, according to someone who worked
for him, didn't go into his first meeting with the Queen already star struck
was Barack Obama. Apparently he rather resisted the ""hype,"" as
this staffer put it. But then he met her. And, like the 11 presidents
before him, he, too, was won over. Indeed, the two developed such a good
relationship that the Queen reportedly asked him to come and visit even after
he left office. I'm told that what changed the 44th president's view was her
sense of responsibility and duty - she was, in Obama language, a no-drama
Queen. US presidents often have a keen sense of history and all those years on the throne wasn't lost on them. As a long day draws to a close in the UK, let's look back at what happened today: Charles III was proclaimed kingby the Accession Council in a ceremony at St James's Palace in London.Read more here.

     here in the capital of Canada, Ottawa. Justin Trudeau and his
     son walked slowly up to Rideau Hall, the residency of the Governor
     General, Mary Simon - she is the representative of the monarch in Canada
     and the first indigenous person to hold that position. Itâs a quiet residency
     just out of town. Wild turkeys walk around the grounds and among the
     trees, some of which have been planted by royals. There are 14
     commonwealth realms in addition to the UK. A realm is a country whose
     monarch is the King. Canada is one of the realms and today, like in the
     UK, there was an official proclamation of the King. Trumpets sounded, the
     doors opened and the Chief Herald walked out of Rideau Hall to announce
     the King of Canada. Firstly in English and then in French, with Trudeau at
     his side, Samy Khalid, proclaimed His Royal Highness Prince Charles III,
     King. Cannon shots were fired,
     flags were raised and Guardsmen marched among the small crowd that had
     gathered.  Tributes for Queen Elizabeth II are continuing to pour in from around the world. Oliver Atkin from Bromley says he remembers meeting the monarch on the Balmoral estate in 2012 while on a family day out. She ""walked straight up to us and said hello. I remember my Mum and Dad introducing us all. She asked where we were going and took time to find out where we were from,"" he recalls.

Windsor Castle today to pay her respects to the Queen. Just feet away when Kate, William, Harry and Meghan came
to speak to the crowd, she was disappointed not to get the chance to talk to
them. âBut honestly it was amazing to see them. Kate was bending to see all the children, if she heard
anyone say her name she would turn around and try to talk to them - like
the Queen did,"" she said. âThey really seem to understand the nation has lost the

"This video can not be played WATCH: Liz Truss announces energy price guarantee for next two years New Prime Minister Liz Truss will limit energy bill rises for all households for two years as the new prime minister tries to prevent widespread hardship. A typical household energy bill will be capped at Â£2,500 annually until 2024. The huge support scheme could cost up to Â£150bn, but Ms Truss refused to put a figure on it, saying ""extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures"". Businesses will get help, with prices capped for six months, a shorter period of protection than many had hoped for. The help will be for everyone in England, Scotland and Wales with equivalent assistance for Northern Ireland. But there are concerns the measures are not targeted enough, with no additional support for the most vulnerable. As a result, millions are still expected to be in fuel poverty this winter. The energy price cap - the highest amount suppliers are allowed to charge households for every unit of energy they use - had been due to rise to Â£3,549 for a typical household from October. To limit the amount customers' bills go up by, the unit price will be capped, although household energy bills will vary according to how much gas and electricity they use. The government will compensate energy firms for the difference between the wholesale price for gas and electricity they pay and the amount they can charge customers. 'Government help on energy bills is no use to me' What the new energy plan means for you How much are energy bills rising under the new plan? Where does the government borrow billions from? Commenting on what steps households should now take, Greg Jackson, chief executive and founder of Octopus Energy, said firms were still working through the details and customers should ""sit tight and wait to hear from their energy supplier"". ""Nothing will change until 1 October and we'll be in touch with everyone before then."" The dramatic state intervention will be funded by government borrowing, adding to the UK's already large debt pile. The total cost of the support will depend on the cost of energy on the international energy markets, which can be extremely volatile. This comes after Ms Truss rejected calls to extend a windfall tax on gas and oil company profits to pay for the package. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the refusal to fund it with a windfall tax showed she was ""driven by dogma"" and ""it's working people who will pay for that"". Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey accused the government of bringing in a ""phony freeze"" while ""refusing to properly tax the eye-watering profits of oil and gas companies."" ""This will still leave struggling families and pensioners facing impossible choices this winter as energy bills almost double,"" he said. Ms Truss argued it was ""the moment to be bold"". ""We are facing a global energy crisis, and there are no cost-free options,"" she said. Gas prices have soared this year, largely due to the conflict in Ukraine which has reduced supplies of Russian gas. Experts and charities warned that without help with soaring energy bills, lives would have been at risk this winter, with people struggling to afford basic day-to-day living costs. Citizens Advice chief executive Dame Clare Moriarty, told the BBC the package will provide ""much-needed relief for millions"" but said she was concerned it is not going to reverse the trends it was seeing. ""We're seeing problems turn up in the summer, which we would normally expect to be winter."" Ms Truss also outlined plans ""to make sure we have security of [energy] supply for the long-term"". This includes issuing new oil and gas exploration licences for the North Sea and lifting the ban on fracking for shale gas ""where there is local support for it"". In addition the government will: Scrap green levies - which add Â£150 to bills each year - which the Â£2,500 cap accounts for Continue with a previously announced Â£400 energy bills discount for all households. Taken together, the government said this ""will bring costs close to where the energy price cap stands today"". Launch a new oil and gas licensing round as early as next week, boosting production in the North Sea Seek to negotiate lower-priced long-term contracts with renewable and nuclear power companies Launch a joint scheme with the Bank of England to provide emergency support to struggling UK energy firms Launch a review to ensure the UK is meeting its Net Zero 2050 target in ""an economically-efficient way"", given the altered economic landscape. The decision to lift the ban on fracking will be controversial.The practice was halted in 2019- as outlined in the Tory Party 2019 manifesto - amid opposition from environmentalists and local concerns over earth tremors. The scheme to limit energy costs for businesses will also cover public sector groups like schools and charities. It will be in place for six months though it will be reviewed in three month's time ""to consider where this should be targeted to make sure those most in need get support"". The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) welcomed the help but said the announcement was ""sparse on detail"". ""Small businesses' instant reaction is that this is not enough information, yet, for them to plan,"" said Martin McTague, chairman of the FSB. Downing Street said the price cap would boost economic growth and curb inflation by as much as 5%. The rate at which prices rise is currently at a 40-year high of 10.1%, largely driven by soaring energy prices. The energy plan is a huge emergency intervention in keeping with the pandemic rescue package. It will lessen the anticipated pain in households and businesses, but not eliminate it. The recession the economy is heading for should be shallower. But these are the headlines of what the plan promises. It is unprecedented for an announcement of this size, to have so few details on the mechanisms involved, and no details on the costs. There is much up for grabs. Some allowance could be given for the fact the administration is only two days old. But it is clear from our reporting up and down the country that more businesses that have closed could have been saved if this package had come more quickly. And the uncertainty for business will not be settled until the actual unit price of energy is announced. The size of the intervention, which looks well in excess of Â£100bn, looks likely to raise questions about whether the PM can deliver her complete programme of promised immediate tax cuts. Much will depend on negotiations with renewables producers and a plan to buy gas on long-term contracts. There is a long queue of nations currently doing the same. Expect to see the new PM in Oslo, Ottawa and the Gulf before long. The plans for long-term production reflect a strategic decision not to be dependent on imported energy, that will take some time to come to fruition. The idea, however, is to address the root cause of a problem years in the making.

"Two government departments have been reprimanded by a watchdog for not responding to Freedom of Information (FOI) requests on time. It is the first time in seven years the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has issued an FOI enforcement notice. The Department for International Trade (DIT) had the worst response rate across all government departments. Action was also taken against the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS). The ICO is an independent watchdog. Its central aim is to promote openness by public bodies and data privacy for individuals. It has issued this latest action against the DIT and BEIS for what it calls ""persistent failures"" to respond. It said the action comes as it renews its approach to regulating the Freedom of Information Act 2000, which commits to taking action against public authorities with consistently poor performance. John Edwards, the Information Commissioner, said: ""Accountability and transparency in the work of public authorities is fundamental to democracy and it is the ICO's role to ensure that people's right to access information is protected. ""I advise public authorities to take note and learn lessons from the action we have taken today, as we will be making greater use of our powers under the Act to drive good practice and compliance."" FOI consultant Martin Rosenbaum told the BBC this was a welcome decision. ""It is the kind of firm and determined action which has been badly needed to tackle serious failings on FOI in government departments. ""It should make it clear to the public authorities with the worst records on FOI compliance that there are limits to what they can get away with. If the new Commissioner continues to show much greater determination and effectiveness in enforcing the FOI Act, it will make a big difference to improving how the system can work in practise for the public benefit,"" he said. The ICO said DIT was late answering more than half of requests from January to March. The department's response times declined in 2021 despite no significant increase in requests or known resource issues at the department. The ICO said the delays were ""simply due to internal process failings, rather than more significant problems"". The department has been told it must respond to any outstanding requests older than 20 working days within 35 calendar days of the enforcement notice. It should also publish an action plan formalising measures to mitigate any future delays. Failure to comply with the notice could lead to the department being found in contempt of court, it has been warned. A DIT spokesperson said: ""We are fully committed to our transparency obligations and responded to over 500 FOI requests received last year. ""We continue to evaluate and improve our internal processes and will respond to the ICO in due course."" BEIS was told to improve its performance, after it ""consistently failed to respond to a significant number of the information access requests received within the statutory time limit"". BEIS has had a 55% increase in requests since 2020, but the ICO found the department's internal procedures were the cause of many responses being delayed, as well as the volume increases. The ICO said that because of mitigations by BEIS and its positive engagement with the watchdog, it was only issued with a practice recommendation rather than an enforcement notice. But the regulator said an enforcement notice could be issued if performance does not improve. A BEIS spokesperson said: ""We are committed to handling requests in a timely way while managing this alongside tackling the energy crisis and driving economic growth, and we are engaging with the ICO's office on the next steps.""

Queen Elizabeth with the Duke of Edinburgh at a lodge in Kenya In January 1952, Princess Elizabeth and her husband the Duke of Edinburgh set off on an overseas tour in place of the monarch, who was terminally ill with lung cancer. Against medical advice, the King went to the airport to see the couple off. It was to be the last time Elizabeth, then just 25 years old, would see her father. She heard the news of his death while staying at a game lodge in Kenya and immediately returned to London as the Queen. She later recalled: ""In a way, I didn't have an apprenticeship. My father died much too young, so it was all a very sudden kind of taking on and making the best job you can.â Queen Elizabeth II returns to England Welsh politicians will be recalled to the Senedd - the Welsh
Parliament - on Sunday to pay tribute to Queen Elizabeth II. The session, in Cardiff Bay, will take place at 14:00 BST and

""One of the reasons we got them was because the Queen had them,"" she said, pushing a pram with two corgis patiently sitting inside. The Queen was known for her love of corgis dating back to when she was a child, and kept dozens of them over the course of her 70-year reign. Read more abouthow the Queen's love of corgis started a global phenomenon On Saturday, Windsor Castle became the site of a rare joint appearance by the new Prince of Wales, William, with his brother Prince Harry, and their wives. It is a building that had deep significance to the monarch throughout her life - a place of work but also her own private retreat. The Queen's special association with Windsor Castle began when she was a child. 
The then-Princess Elizabeth and her family made Royal Lodge - a mansion in the grounds of the Windsor Estate - their weekend country home. The first instinct of many mourning the death of Queen Elizabeth II has been to leave flowers at Windsor Castle.  At the age of 14, the then-princess and her sister Margaret were sent to the castle for much of World War Two while their home in London faced the threat of being bombed. The castle has been inhabited continuously by 40 monarchs across almost 1,000 years. With 1,000 rooms, 13 acres (five hectares) of grounds and reminders of its rich history amid the gothic architecture, it is little wonder the Queen saw the castle as a sanctuary.

From world leaders to members of the public, people reflected on Her Majesty's legacy. Tributes for the Queen have poured in from statesmen around the world, and on Saturday, the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was the latest to issue his  condolences. On Twitter, Blinken posted a photo from the US embassy in Washington, thanking the Queen for her ""steadfast leadership"" and ""unwavering commitment to service"". Dame Karen Pierce, the UK ambassador to the US, thanked Blinken for the message, calling the Queen ""our foremost diplomat"" and ""active supporter"" of the two countries' ""special relationship"" - a phrase that had been coined by her first prime minister, Churchill.

"Queen Elizabeth II, the UK's longest-serving monarch, has died at Balmoral aged 96, after reigning for 70 years. She died peacefully on Thursday afternoon at her Scottish estate, where she had spent much of the summer. The Queen came to the throne in 1952 and witnessed enormous social change. Her son King Charles III said the death of his beloved mother was a ""moment of great sadness"" for him and his family and that her loss would be ""deeply felt"" around the world. He said: ""We mourn profoundly the passing of a cherished sovereign and a much-loved mother. ""I know her loss will be deeply felt throughout the country, the realms and the Commonwealth, and by countless people around the world."" During the coming period of mourning, he said he and his family would be ""comforted and sustained by our knowledge of the respect and deep affection in which the Queen was so widely held"". The King and his wife, Camilla, now Queen Consort, will return to London on Friday, Buckingham Palace said. He is expected to address the nation. Senior royals had gathered at Balmoral after the Queen's doctors became concerned about her health earlier in the day. All the Queen's children travelled to Balmoral, near Aberdeen, after doctors placed the Queen under medical supervision. Her grandson and now heir to the throne, Prince William, and his brother, Prince Harry, also gathered there. Obituary: A long life marked by a sense of duty Moment her death was announced on the BBC Politicians pay tribute to Queen Elizabeth II King Charles III, the new monarch Prime Minister Liz Truss, who was appointed by the Queen on Tuesday, said the monarch was the rock on which modern Britain was built, who had ""provided us with the stability and strength that we needed"". Speaking about the new King, she said: ""We offer him our loyalty and devotion, just as his mother devoted so much, to so many, for so long. ""And with the passing of the second Elizabethan age, we usher in a new era in the magnificent history of our great country, exactly as Her Majesty would have wished, by saying the words 'God save the King'."" The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby - spiritual leader to the Church of England of which the monarch is supreme governor - expressed his ""profound sadness"". He said his ""prayers are with the King and the Royal Family"". This video can not be played Queen's death a huge shock to the nation and the world - Prime Minister Truss Queen Elizabeth II's tenure as head of state spanned post-war austerity, the transition from empire to Commonwealth, the end of the Cold War and the UK's entry into - and withdrawal from - the European Union. Her reign spanned 15 prime ministers starting with Winston Churchill, born in 1874, and including Ms Truss, born 101 years later in 1975. She held weekly audiences with her prime minister throughout her reign. At Buckingham Palace in London, crowds awaiting updates on the Queen's condition began crying as they heard of her death. The union flag on top of the palace was lowered to half-mast at 18:30 BST and an official notice announcing the death was posted outside. On the Queen's death, Prince William and his wife, Catherine, became the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Cornwall. The official notice read: ""The Queen died peacefully at Balmoral this afternoon. The King and Queen Consort will remain at Balmoral this evening and will return to London tomorrow."" The Queen was born Elizabeth Alexandra Mary Windsor, in Mayfair, London, on 21 April 1926. Few could have foreseen she would become monarch but in December 1936 her uncle, Edward VIII, abdicated from the throne to marry the twice-divorced American, Wallis Simpson. Elizabeth's father became King George VI and, at age 10, Lilibet, as she was known in the family, became heir to the throne. Within three years, Britain was at war with Nazi Germany. Elizabeth and her younger sister, Princess Margaret, spent much of wartime at Windsor Castle after their parents rejected suggestions they be evacuated to Canada. After turning 18, Elizabeth spent five months with the Auxiliary Territorial Service and learned basic motor mechanic and driving skills. ""I began to understand the esprit de corps that flourishes in the face of adversity,"" she recalled later. Through the war, she exchanged letters with her third cousin, Philip, Prince of Greece, who was serving in the Royal Navy. Their romance blossomed and the couple married at Westminster Abbey on 20 November 1947, with the prince taking the title of Duke of Edinburgh. She would later describe him as ""my strength and stay"" through 74 years of marriage, before his death in 2021, aged 99. The Duke of Edinburgh was at the Queen's side for more than six decades of reign, becoming the longest-serving consort in British history in 2009 Their first son, Charles, was born in 1948, followed by Princess Anne, in 1950, Prince Andrew, in 1960, and Prince Edward, in 1964. Between them, they gave their parents eight grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren. Princess Elizabeth was in Kenya in 1952, representing the ailing King, when Philip broke the news that her father had died. She immediately returned to London as the new Queen. ""It was all a very sudden kind of taking on and making the best job you can,"" she later recalled. Elizabeth was crowned at Westminster Abbey on 2 June 1953, aged 27, in front of a then-record TV audience estimated at more than 20 million people. Subsequent decades would see great change, with the end of the British Empire overseas and the Swinging '60s sweeping away social norms at home. Thousands gathered outside Buckingham Palace after the death was announced Charles, as the Prince of Wales, delivered the Queen's speech on behalf of his mother for the first time in May Elizabeth reformed the monarchy for this less deferential age, engaging with the public through walkabouts, royal visits and attendance at public events. Her commitment to the Commonwealth was a constant - she visited every Commonwealth country at least once. But there were periods of private and public pain. In 1992, the Queen's ""annus horribilis"", fire devastated Windsor Castle - a private residence as well as working palace - and three of her children's marriages broke down. After the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, in a car accident in Paris in 1997, the Queen drew criticism for appearing reluctant to respond publicly. There were questions about the monarchy's relevance in modern society. ""No institutionâ¦ should expect to be free from the scrutiny of those who give it their loyalty and support, not to mention those who don't,"" she acknowledged. Elizabeth Alexandra Mary Windsor was born in Mayfair, London, on 21 April 1926, the first child of the Duke and Duchess of York As a 21-year-old princess, Elizabeth had vowed to devote her life to service. Reflecting on those words decades later, during her Silver Jubilee in 1977, she declared: ""Although that vow was made in my salad days, when I was green in judgment, I do not regret nor retract one word of it."" That same commitment to serving was made 45 years later in a thank you letter to the nation on the weekend of her Platinum Jubilee in June. The milestone was celebrated with a mix of state ceremonies and a colourful festival of all things British, as well as lively street parties. Although the Queen's health kept her from some events, she said: ""My heart has been with you all."" In a moment met with cheers from huge crowds in the Mall, she was joined by three generations of her family on the Buckingham Palace balcony for the finale of a pageant. On her Platinum Jubilee, the Queen delighted crowds by appearing on the balcony with three generations of her family King Charles, aged 73, becomes head of state in 15 Commonwealth realms, including the UK. He and his wife, Camilla, are at Balmoral alongside his siblings, Princess Anne, and Princes Andrew and Edward. They are accompanied by Edward's wife, Sophie, as well as Princes William and Harry. William's wife, Catherine, remained at Windsor with their children - George, Charlotte and Louis - as it has been their first full day at a new school. Prince William drove a group of senior royals - including Prince Andrew and Prince Edward - to Balmoral Prince Harry arrived at Balmoral later to join other senior royals The Royal Family has now entered a period of mourning. In the coming days, much of national life will be put on hold. Official engagements will be cancelled and union flags will be flown at half-mast on royal residences, government buildings, across the Armed Forces and on UK posts overseas. Members of Parliament will pay tribute to the Queen and take an oath to King Charles. There will be church bells tolling and gun salutes as local and national organisations and charities organise ways to pay their respects, with commemorative events and books of condolence. A state funeral for the Queen is expected in the next two weeks. Foreign leaders have paid tribute to the Queen, with US President Joe Biden recalling how she stood in solidarity with the US in their ""darkest days"" after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. To France's president, Emmanuel Macron, she was a ""kind-hearted Queen"" and ""friend of France"". For Justin Trudeau, Canada's prime minister, the Queen was a constant in Canadians' lives and one of his ""favourite people in the world"".

"The Queen was seen on Tuesday when she appointed Liz Truss as prime minister at Balmoral The Queen is under medical supervision at Balmoral after doctors became concerned for her health, Buckingham Palace has said. All the Queen's children have gathered at her Scottish estate near Aberdeen. ""Following further evaluation this morning, the Queen's doctors are concerned for Her Majesty's health and have recommended she remain under medical supervision,"" a statement said. The Queen is ""comfortable"", it added. It is very unusual for Buckingham Palace to put out a statement like this - it is usually unwilling to provide a commentary on the 96-year-old monarch's medical matters, which are seen as private. Her son, Prince Charles, is at Balmoral with his wife, Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall. Her grandson, the Duke of Cambridge, other sons, the Duke of York and the Earl of Wessex, and his wife Sophie, the Countess of Wessex, arrived at Aberdeen airport just before 16:00 BST. Prince William drove them alone in a car together to the Queen's Scottish estate, a journey of about 40 miles (64km). This video can not be played Watch: Plane carrying senior royals lands in Aberdeen Her daughter Princess Anne was already in Scotland undertaking engagements and is in Balmoral. The Duchess of Cambridge has remained in Windsor with her children on their first full day at school. The Duke of Sussex is travelling separately to Balmoral. A spokeswoman said his wife Meghan was not accompanying him. The US-based couple had been in the UK to attend a charity function. There are clearly pressing concerns for the Queen's health - much more explicitly put than before and without any reference to this only being about difficulties with mobility. There are also warnings against unfounded speculation, such as that she might have had a fall. And on Tuesday she was photographed smiling as she appointed new Prime Minister Liz Truss. But from the last-minute cancellation of what would only have been a virtual meeting of the Privy Council - of senior ministers - there is no mistaking the fragility of the Queen's health. Ms Truss said the ""whole country"" would be ""deeply concerned"" by the news. ""My thoughts - and the thoughts of people across our United Kingdom - are with Her Majesty The Queen and her family at this time,"" she added. Prince William drove the group of royals - including Prince Andrew and Prince Edward - to Balmoral The Queen appointed Ms Truss as prime minister at Balmoral, instead of travelling to London for the event. During her 70-year reign the Queen has typically had an audience with her new prime minister at Buckingham Palace. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, said: ""My prayers, and the prayers of people across the [Church of England] and the nation, are with Her Majesty The Queen today. ""May God's presence strengthen and comfort Her Majesty, her family, and those who are caring for her at Balmoral."" The Queen is also head of state for 14 Commonwealth realms, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the country was ""wishing her well, and sending our best to the Royal Family"". The White House said US President Joe Biden had been briefed and that his and First Lady Jill Biden's thoughts were ""solidly and squarely with the Queen today and her family"". Live updates: Queen's doctors concerned for her health Who is in the UK's Royal Family? How does the Royal Family work? Political leaders send best wishes to Queen News of the Queen's ill-health came as MPs heard details of the government's new plan to help households and businesses with energy costs in the House of Commons. Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Nadhim Zahawi entered the Commons and spoke to Ms Truss. Notes were then passed to the Commons speaker and Labour front bench. The palace statement came minutes later. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he was ""deeply worried"", while Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon sent her thoughts and wishes to the Queen. Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford sent his best wishes on behalf of the people of Wales. The monarch has been on a summer break at her Scottish home since July.

"The ban on fracking in England will be reinstated, new Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has said. It reverses a decision by his predecessor Liz Truss. Fracking was first halted in England in 2019, amid opposition from green groups and concerns about earth tremors. Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, is a technique for recovering gas and oil from shale rock. It involves drilling into the earth and directing a high-pressure mixture of water, sand and chemicals at a rock layer, to release the gas inside. This video can not be played The BBC's David Shukman explains how fracking works Wells can be drilled vertically or horizontally in order to release the gas. The injection of fluid at high pressure into the rock can cause earth tremors - small movements in the earth's surface. More than 120 tremorswere recorded,externalduring drilling at a Cuadrilla site in Blackpool,including one which lasted almost 100 hours. Seismic events of this scale are considered minor and are rarely felt by people - but are a concern to local residents. Shale gas is also a fossil fuel, and campaigners say allowing fracking could distract energy firms and governments from investing in renewable and green sources of energy. Fracking also uses huge amounts of water, which must be transported to the site at significant environmental cost. Rishi Sunak was asked about fracking at his first Prime Minister's Questions, by Green Party MP Caroline Lucas. He told the Commons he ""stands by"" the 2019 Conservative Party manifesto, which pledged to maintain a ban on the practice in England. It had banned fracking earlier that year and stated that it would not be allowed unless the science changed. A scientific review into fracking by the British Geological Survey says there is still a limited understanding of the impacts of such drilling. Rishi Sunak reimposes fracking ban in England Mr Sunak's stance reverses a decision taken by the government in September, when Liz Truss was prime minister. At that time it saidfracking could go ahead in some places. It said it could help the UK strengthen the security of its energy supplies, amid uncertainty caused by the war in Ukraine. The Scottish and Welsh governments continue to oppose fracking, and say they will not use their powers to grant drilling licences. An anti-fracking protester writes messages on a wall in Lancashire Fracking for shale gas in the UK has only taken place on a small scale and has faced several public and legal challenges. However, exploration has identifiedlarge swathes of shale gas across the UK,external, particularly in northern England. More than 100 exploration and drilling licences were awarded to firms including Third Energy, IGas, Aurora Energy Resources and Ineos. Cuadrilla was the only company given consent to begin fracking. It drilled two wells at a site in Lancashire butfaced repeated protestsfrom local people and campaigners. The Oil and Gas Authority told Cuadrillato permanently concrete and abandon the wells,external. It is not clear what difference restarting fracking would make to energy bills. The UK can only meet 48% of its gas demand from domestic supplies (this would be 54% if it did not export any gas). A small number of Tory MPs, known as the Net Zero Scrutiny Group,claimed restarting drilling at Cuadrilla's two existing wells could be done quickly, and would provide significant supplies,external. Cuadrilla claimed that ""just 10%"" of the gas from shale deposits in Lancashire and surrounding areas""could supply 50 years' worth of current UK gas demand"",external. Energy experts dispute this, pointing out that the UK's shale gas reserves are held in complex layers of rock. Mike Bradshaw, professor of global energy at Warwick University, says estimates of how much shale gas the UK hasare not the same as the amount of gas that could be produced commercially,external. And BBC business editor Simon Jack recently shared a quotemade by Kwasi Kwarteng when he was business secretary,external: ""No amount of shale gas from wells across rural England would be enough to lower European price any time soon."" Shale gas in the US is estimated to make up 25% of its total gas reserves It is thought that fracking has given energy security to the US and Canada for the next 100 years, and has presented an opportunity to generate electricity at half the CO2 emissions of coal. Fracking remains banned in numerous EU countries, including Germany, France and Spain, as well as Australia. Authorities in countries including Brazil and Argentina are split, with some banning the practice, and others allowing operations.

"Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, many countries have pledged to end or restrict their oil and gas imports to curtail Moscow's revenues and hinder its war effort. The Russian economy is highly dependent on its energy sector, and Europe is a major importer of Russian energy, making cutting back difficult. EU nations haveended imports of Russian oil brought in by sea, and a ban on refined oil products will come in from 5 February. The United States said last March it would stop importing Russian oil, and the UK said it was banning Russian crude oil and refined productswith effect from 5 December,external. European countries have sought to reduce their dependence on Russian gas An oil price capapproved by Western allies in Decemberalso aims to prevent Russia getting more than $60 (Â£48) for a barrel of crude oil. Russia's gas sector has also been targeted. The EU said in March it wouldcut gas imports from Russia by two-thirds within a year. The UK, which only imported small quantities of Russian gas, it has now ended this altogether. Urals oil is currently being exported from Russia's north western sea port of Primorsk for around $40 per barrel, from where it has largely gone to European destinations. The value of Russian oil from other ports and pipelines varies, but the Urals price has fallen across the board since the EU banned imports of Russian oil by sea. The price cap on Russian oil was agreed by the world's major economies at the same time. But energy analyst Ben McWilliams believes it is the EU oil embargo impacting the price, rather than the price cap. ""Russian oil is being traded at around $50 (Â£40) per barrel. That has been driven by the embargo because Russia now has to try to sell elsewhere."" Moscow is losing out on about $175m (Â£140m) a day from fossil fuel exports due to these measures, according toa study by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA).,external India is taking advantage of cheaper oil imported from Russia Major Russian banks have also been removed from the international financial messaging system Swift. Countries continuing to trade with Russia have sought ways around this. Both China and India are increasingly making their oil and gas purchases in their local currencies. India, China and Turkey all ramped up their purchases of Russian oil last year - and together they now make up 70% of all Russian crude flows by sea. And Russia was offering its oil at a significantly lower price than the global benchmark Brent crude. At the start of 2022, Russia supplied less than 2% of India's oil imports, but it is now on course to become its largest single supplier. China's imports of Russian oil have fluctuated, but have also risen over the past year. In 2021,more than half of all Russia's crude oil exports,externalwent to countries in Europe. But in 2022, UK imports of oil from Russia fell sharply and other European countries have cut back too. But some have remained heavily reliant, such as the Slovak Republic and Hungary. European countries have been looking to see if they can source supplies elsewhere. The International Energy Agency (IEA) club of oil importing countries agreed to release 120m barrels of crude from their stocks in 2022. The US also released some of its strategic reserves last year. But calls for oil-rich nations such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Venezuela to increase production have not been successful. Opec and other major oil producerscut production in late 2022 to sustain prices. Reducing gas imports from Russia has been a major challenge for many European countries, as the continent has been getting most of its gas through pipelines linked to Russia. In 2021, Russia was supplying EU countries with 40% of their natural gas, with Germany the largest importer, followed by Italy and the Netherlands. That had dropped to around 17% by August 2022,according to EU figures.,external In 2021, the UK got just 4% of its gas supply from Russian. It now imports none. EU states areincreasingly looking to ship in liquefied natural gas,external(LNG) in tankers from producers such as the US and Qatar. Your device may not support this visualisation The shift towards LNG imports by European countries has been very significant, replacing supplies from Russia. However, ""there aren't enough LNG terminals in Europe"", says energy advisor Kate Dourian. ""This will be a problem for Germany, particularly."" There are several new LNG terminals planned and some already under construction across Europe as countries try to boost their capacity. Clarification 21 October: A previous version of this story contained a graphic with the title: 'The UK has much less gas storage than some other European countries'. The aim was to show how much gas the UK had in storage at that time. It was not intended to show the UK's total capacity for gas storage. How can the world cope without Russian oil and gas?

"The government plans to move nuclear and renewable electricity generators to lower price contracts to cut bills, Prime Minister Liz Truss has said. ""Renewable and nuclear generators will move on to contracts for difference, to end the situation where electricity prices are set by the marginal price of gas,"" Truss told Parliament. The price paid to these companies is often set by the most costly generator. That is currently hugely expensive gas. Moving nuclear and renewable generators onto lower-priced contracts ""will mean that generators are receiving a fair price reflecting their cost of production, further bringing down the cost of this intervention,"" Truss said. The government will ask renewable and nuclear generators to take up new 10 or 15-year contracts at fixed prices well below the current rates, sources familiar with the discussions say. Liz Truss says she won't introduce a windfall tax on energy companies, but she will need to address the issue of their huge profits. The energy market consultancy Cornwall Insight estimates energy prices are likely to be more than Â£40bn higher because of the fact that some electricity generators are being paid based on the hugely inflated gas price. That is a particularly pressing issue when the government is planning to spend tens of billions of pounds of taxpayers' money subsidising the nation's energy bills. Paying renewable energy companies less than the market price for gas would mean a very significant reduction in revenues for them, at least in the medium term. Yet RenewableUK, the industry body which represents most of the wind power companies in this group, has accepted this approach in principle. ""We're keen to work collaboratively with the government"" on the issue, RenewableUK's CEO Dan McGrail said. ""It makes no sense to allow the exorbitantly expensive cost of gas to set the price for the whole of the electricity market"", he said. How much are energy bills rising under the new plan? What is the windfall tax on oil and gas companies? What is fracking? RenewableUK represents most of the biggest renewable businesses in the UK including Orsted, Scottish Power, SSE, RWE and EDF. It confirms its members have had a ""series of discussions"" with the government on the issue and says it is waiting for the government to ""take a position"". So, why might they accept this huge potential hit to profits? RenewableUK says it is because the companies recognise it isn't fair for consumers to face such high prices at a time of national crisis. Those close to the discussions say they are probably also being offered a generous long-term price to reflect the short-term loss of profits. Shadow climate change secretary Ed Miliband told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Thursday that such long-term fixed-price contracts would have the effect of ensuring huge profits for electricity companies for years to come. ""This is a proposal from (energy industry trade association) Energy UK, and let's be clear about this proposal: This would lock in massive windfall profits for these electricity generators. ""Let me explain why: what Energy UK have said is we'll accept slightly lower prices now, so we can have much higher prices over the following 15 years. ""This would be a terrible deal for the British people, a terrible deal for billpayers. ""It is much better - if there are these unexpected windfalls, and there are - the right thing to do, the fair thing to do, is not to do some dodgy deal with these companies, but to do a windfall tax. Liz Truss may be ideologically opposed to windfall taxes but paying private companies billions of pounds in excess profits from the public purse is also a political liability. The companies know that if a solution isn't found she might deicide she has to hold her nose and impose such a tax, and that if she does, she might go after the billions of profits the companies have already made.

"Liz Truss has announced she will limit energy bill rises for all households until the next election People in Wales still face a ""difficult winter"" despiteLiz Truss's announcementthe government will cap average household energy bills at Â£2,500 a year, a charity has warned. The support will last for two years, starting in October. ""The announcement will provide some reassurance... However, this alone will not solve the cost of living crisis,"" Citizens Advice Cymru said. It added low income and vulnerable households would still struggle. The prime minister's two-year plan supersedes the existing energy price cap, and is in addition to the announced Â£400 energy bills discount for all households. Jacqui Cadogan, from Caldicot, Monmouthshire, was among those who had been calling for an energy price cap. ""People are struggling and we're hearing about all these big companies that are making billions of pounds in profit,"" she said prior to the PM's announcement. She had started turning plugs off and had bought sleeping bags, a tent and tea lights for winter, adding: ""I'm just preparing. Worst-case scenario. I just want to be ready for anything. Businesses are also getting a support package, but only for six months. Owners have been calling for urgent help for Welsh businesses, warning they may not survive the winter. Bridgend-based doughnut bakery WhoCult said its electricity costs had trebled in recent months. The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) said many businesses faced a ""cliff edge"" as energy deals ended. Liz Truss set to unveil plans to cut energy bills for millions What is the energy price cap? People who wish they had an energy price cap Peter's Pies Managing Director Mike Grimwood was among those who had called for a unit cap price for businesses such as his, based in Bedwas, Caerphilly county. He called the situation ""pretty stark"" prior to the announcement, adding: ""There's only one thing we can do - emergency price increases are being warned to our customers."" Other costs, including ingredients, have risen by 33%, he said. ""We are talking to all our customers and saying this a question of business survival."" Peter's Pies delivers baked products to consumers around Wales and further afield Scott Magill, the owner and founder of WhoCult Coffee and Donuts in Bridgend, said ""urgent help"" was needed. He had seen energy costs treble recently to Â£3,000 a month, just as the company expanded with a new shop in Barry, Vale of Glamorgan. ""I think a lot of businesses won't be able survive this winter,"" Mr Magill said. ""We have tightened our belt in many departments, but the cost of ingredients has gone up, the cost of electric has gone up, and something has got to give."" Mr Magill's business thrived through the Covid pandemic The business opened just before the Covid-19 pandemic, developing from a small doughnut outlet to a larger cafe and its own bakery. Mr Magill also runs a T-shirt printing company on the same site. While it has been a success and takings are up, the rising cost of ingredients and energy means it has become harder to make a profit. ""We have only recently noticed the rise in the energy cost, I would say in the last three to five months. That's especially since having this bakery, this bakery is only one year old,"" Mr Magill said. ""Unfortunately the cost of the rising electric, apart from turning off the odd plug, there is not much more we can do. A lot of equipment needs to stay on all day, every day, unfortunately. With us now making more doughnuts with a second store, they are in use more than normal."" There is concern over how small businesses will survive the winter without help Red Flag Alert, which monitors the financial health of firms, saidtens of thousands of businesses risked going underbecause of rising costs.

"Gas and electricity bills are going up again on 1 January, when the latest energy price cap takes effect. Customers are encouraged to submit a meter reading to ensure they are charged the correct amount. The energy price cap covers 26 million households in England, Wales and Scotland and is setevery three months,externalby the energy regulator Ofgem. It fixes the maximum price that can be charged for each unit of energy on a standard - or default - tariff for a typical dual-fuel household which pays by direct debit. Between 1 January and 31 March 2025,gas prices will be capped at 6.34p per kilowatt hour (kWh), and electricity at 24.86 per kWh.,external This means the annual bill for a dual-fuel direct debit household using a typical amount of energywill go up to Â£1,738 per year, an increase of Â£21 from the previous cap. Those who pay their bills every three months by cash or cheque will pay Â£1,851. Analysts at forecaster Cornwall Insight, which tracks the energy market, expect prices to fall slightly in April and October 2025, but says thathigh domestic energy prices are likely to be ""the new normal"". The cap does not apply in Northern Ireland, which has its own energy market. Your energy bill depends on the overall amount of gas and electricity you use, and how you pay for it. The type of property you live in, how energy efficient it is, how many people live there and the weather all make a difference. The Ofgem cap is based on a ""typical household"" using 11,500 kWh of gas and 2,700 kWh of electricity a year with a single bill for gas and electricity, settled by direct debit. The vast majority of people pay their bill this way to help spread payments across the year. Those who pay every three months by cash or cheque are charged more. Energy prices could vary at different times of day Submitting a meter reading when the cap changes means you will not be charged for estimated usage at the wrong rate. This is especially important when prices go up. Customers withworking smart metersdo not need to submit a reading as their bill is calculated automatically. Fixed-priced deals offer certainty for a set period - often a year, or longer - but if prices drop, you could be stuck at a higher price. Ofgem says customers who want the security of a set price should consider fixed deals. However, it recommends getting independent advice. The price comparison site Uswitch says it is important to check whether fixed deals have exit fees before signing up and to make sure you fully understand the terms of the contract. Because the price cap changes every three months, it is difficult to know with any certainty whether a fixed tariff is a good deal. The longer the fixed term, the greater the uncertainty. Between January and March, households on prepayment meters will pay slightly less than those on direct debit, with a typical bill of Â£1,690, a rise of Â£21 from the previous quarter. About four million households had prepayment meters in April 2024, according to Ofgem. Many have been in place for years, but some were installed more recently after customers struggled to pay higher bills. Rulesintroduced in November 2023,externalmean suppliers must give customers more opportunity to clear their debts before switching them to a meter. They cannot be installed at all in certain households. Energy firms pay out over force-fitting of meters Standing charges are a fixed daily fee to cover the costs of connecting to a supply. They are typically 61p a day for electricity and 32p a day for gas, although they vary slightly by region. Under the energy price cap, they have risen by 43% since 2019. Campaigners argue standing charges are unfair because they make up a larger proportion of the bill of low energy users. Ofgem has proposed thatenergy firms must provide a choice of price-capped tariffsfrom winter 2025, one which has a standing charge and unit rate - as is the case now - and another with no standing charge but a higher unit rate. Customers would be able to choose which suits them best. Separately, it wants a consistent approach from suppliers on how to deal with unpaid bills totalling Â£3.8bn. Changes to the winter fuel payment mean more than 10 million pensioners are not receiving the money this winter. Previously, it was paid to all pensioners in England and Wales born before 25 September 1957. However, in July, the government said future payments would be made only to those on low incomes who receivedcertain benefits, including pension credit. The 2024 payment - worth Â£200 or Â£300 depending on individual circumstances - is paid automatically to eligible pensioners. However, hundreds of thousands of people who are entitled to pension credit do not claim it, which means they will miss out on the winter fuel payment too. How much is the winter fuel payment and who can still get it? TheÂ£500m Household Support Fund,,externalwhich was introduced in September 2021 to help vulnerable customershas been extended until March 2025. TheWarm Home Discount scheme,externalcontinues to offer a discount to eligible pensioners and low income households. The government'sFuel Direct Scheme,externalcan help people to repay an energy debt directly from their benefit payments. In addition, suppliers must offer customers affordable payment plans or repayment holidays if they are struggling with bills. Most suppliers also offer hardship grants.

"Pharmacists will be able to sell the tablets over the counter Women experiencing vaginal dryness as a result of the menopause can now buy a treatment over the counter in the UK. Estradiol tablets, sold under the brand name Gina10, were previously offered on prescription only. They will be available to women over the age of 50 who have not had a period for more than a year, as part of hormone replacement therapy treatment (HRT). Pharmacists have been offered training to identify who needs the tablets. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) made the decision as part of a strategy to make menopause treatment more accessible for women. Estradiol tablets treat vaginal symptoms caused by a lack of oestrogen, such as dryness, soreness, itching, burning and uncomfortable sex. The product is inserted into the vagina rather than taken by mouth. What you need to know about HRT What does the menopause do to the body? HRT crisis ridiculous and needs fixing - McCall MHRA chief healthcare quality and access officer Dr Laura Squirecalled the move,externala ""landmark reclassification for millions of women in the UK"". ""In reaching this decision, we have seen positive support from a wide range of people, including many women aged 50 years and above who could benefit from this decision,"" she said. The MHRA hopes the move will relieve pressure on front-line NHS services and give women more freedom in choosing treatments that work for them. Dr Paula Briggs, a consultant in sexual and reproductive health at Liverpool Women's Hospital, said 50-80% of women going through the menopause experienced vaginal dryness but often put it down to ageing. ""Yet it can be easily treated. Most women can use this new treatment and they should be offered it routinely,"" she said. There has been a number of issues with HRT supplies during the past few months, and emergency measures were brought in such asprescribing limits and swaps. Madelaine McTernan was brought in to oversee a government taskforce to deal with distribution but has now returned to her original role overseeing vaccines ahead of anautumn Covid booster rollout. The government says supply issues have improved but stock of about 12 products, including some gels and creams, remains low.

"The Queen was seen on Tuesday when she appointed Liz Truss as prime minister at Balmoral The Queen is under medical supervision at Balmoral after doctors became concerned for her health, Buckingham Palace has said. All the Queen's children have gathered at her Scottish estate near Aberdeen. ""Following further evaluation this morning, the Queen's doctors are concerned for Her Majesty's health and have recommended she remain under medical supervision,"" a statement said. The Queen is ""comfortable"", it added. It is very unusual for Buckingham Palace to put out a statement like this - it is usually unwilling to provide a commentary on the 96-year-old monarch's medical matters, which are seen as private. Her son, Prince Charles, is at Balmoral with his wife, Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall. Her grandson, the Duke of Cambridge, other sons, the Duke of York and the Earl of Wessex, and his wife Sophie, the Countess of Wessex, arrived at Aberdeen airport just before 16:00 BST. Prince William drove them alone in a car together to the Queen's Scottish estate, a journey of about 40 miles (64km). This video can not be played Watch: Plane carrying senior royals lands in Aberdeen Her daughter Princess Anne was already in Scotland undertaking engagements and is in Balmoral. The Duchess of Cambridge has remained in Windsor with her children on their first full day at school. The Duke of Sussex is travelling separately to Balmoral. A spokeswoman said his wife Meghan was not accompanying him. The US-based couple had been in the UK to attend a charity function. There are clearly pressing concerns for the Queen's health - much more explicitly put than before and without any reference to this only being about difficulties with mobility. There are also warnings against unfounded speculation, such as that she might have had a fall. And on Tuesday she was photographed smiling as she appointed new Prime Minister Liz Truss. But from the last-minute cancellation of what would only have been a virtual meeting of the Privy Council - of senior ministers - there is no mistaking the fragility of the Queen's health. Ms Truss said the ""whole country"" would be ""deeply concerned"" by the news. ""My thoughts - and the thoughts of people across our United Kingdom - are with Her Majesty The Queen and her family at this time,"" she added. Prince William drove the group of royals - including Prince Andrew and Prince Edward - to Balmoral The Queen appointed Ms Truss as prime minister at Balmoral, instead of travelling to London for the event. During her 70-year reign the Queen has typically had an audience with her new prime minister at Buckingham Palace. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, said: ""My prayers, and the prayers of people across the [Church of England] and the nation, are with Her Majesty The Queen today. ""May God's presence strengthen and comfort Her Majesty, her family, and those who are caring for her at Balmoral."" The Queen is also head of state for 14 Commonwealth realms, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the country was ""wishing her well, and sending our best to the Royal Family"". The White House said US President Joe Biden had been briefed and that his and First Lady Jill Biden's thoughts were ""solidly and squarely with the Queen today and her family"". Live updates: Queen's doctors concerned for her health Who is in the UK's Royal Family? How does the Royal Family work? Political leaders send best wishes to Queen News of the Queen's ill-health came as MPs heard details of the government's new plan to help households and businesses with energy costs in the House of Commons. Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Nadhim Zahawi entered the Commons and spoke to Ms Truss. Notes were then passed to the Commons speaker and Labour front bench. The palace statement came minutes later. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he was ""deeply worried"", while Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon sent her thoughts and wishes to the Queen. Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford sent his best wishes on behalf of the people of Wales. The monarch has been on a summer break at her Scottish home since July. Barriers have been placed outside one of the entrances to the estate.

"King Charles III has stepped back from royal duties while he is treated for cancer. His elder son Prince William - along with other senior royals - will take on some of his engagements. Find out more about the Royal Family and the line of succession below. Born: 1948 Charles has been King since his mother Elizabeth II died on 8 September 2022. The now former Prince of Wales married Lady Diana Spencer, who became the Princess of Wales, on 29 July 1981. The couple had two sons, William and Harry.

Like her brother, she gained the right to use the royal title when her grandfather became king. Born: 1960 Prince Andrew,eighth in line to the throne,was the third child of Elizabeth II and Prince Philip - but the first to be born to a reigning monarch for 103 years. He was created the Duke of York on his marriage to Sarah Ferguson, who became Duchess of York, in 1986. They had two daughters - Beatrice, in 1988, and Eugenie, in 1990. In March 1992 it was announced the duke and duchess were to separate. They divorced in 1996. The duke served for 22 years in the Royal Navy and saw active service in the Falklands War in 1982. In addition to royal engagements, he served as a special trade representative for the government until 2011.

She married her long-term boyfriend Jack Brooksbank at Windsor Castle on 12 October 2018. Born: 2021 Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank's son, August, born on 9 February 2021. Born: 2023 Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank's second son was born on 30 May 2023. It is the first royal birth since the coronation of King Charles, Eugenie's uncle. Ernest is13th in line to the throne, moving the Duke of Edinburgh down to 14th place. Born: 1964 Prince Edward was given the title Duke of Edinburgh on his 59th birthday, almost two years after the death of his father Prince Philip, who previously held the title. It was understood that Philip had wanted Edward to take on the title, but the decision was left to King Charles. Prince Edward's wife Sophie becomes the Duchess of Edinburgh and the prince's former title, the Earl of Wessex, has now been given to his son James, Viscount Severn. The couple also have a daughter, Lady Louise, born in 2003. After a brief period with the Royal Marines, the prince formed his own TV production company. He subsequently supported the late queen in her official duties and carried out public engagements for charities. He is14th in line to the throne. Born: 2007 James, Earl of Wessex is the younger child of the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh. He was given the title after his father Prince Edward became the Duke of Edinburgh in March 2023. When James was born, he was given the title Viscount Severn - a ""courtesy"" title as son of an earl, rather than using prince. It is thought his parents made this decision to avoid some of the burdens of royal titles. Born: 2003 Born in 2003, Lady Louise Windsor is the elder child of the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh. However, she is lower in the line of succession than her younger brother because she was born before a law came into force scrapping the system that meant a younger son could displace an older daughter. Born: 1950 Anne, Princess Royal is Elizabeth II and Prince Philip's second child and only daughter. When she was born she was third in line to the throne, but is now17th. She was given the title Princess Royal in June 1987. Princess Anne has married twice; her first husband Captain Mark Phillips is the father of her two children, Peter and Zara, while her second is Vice-Admiral Sir Timothy Laurence. The princess was the first royal to use the surname Mountbatten-Windsor in an official document, in the marriage register after her wedding to Capt Phillips. She competed in equestrian events for Great Britain in the 1976 Montreal Olympics and is involved with a number of charities, including Save the Children, of which she has been president since 1970. Born: 1977 Peter Phillips is the eldest of the late queen's grandchildren. He married Canadian Autumn Kelly in 2008 and together they have two daughters, Savannah, born in 2010, and Isla, born in 2012. The children of the Princess Royal do not have royal titles, as they are descended from the female line. Mark Phillips refused the offer of an earldom when he married so their children do not have courtesy titles. Peter Phillips and his wife announced they were getting divorced in February 2020. Born: 2010 Savannah, born in 2010, is the elder daughter of Peter Phillips and Autumn Kelly and was the late queen's first great-grandchild. Born: 2012 Isla, born in 2012, is the second daughter of Peter Phillips and Autumn Kelly. Born: 1981 Zara Tindall followed her mother and father with a highly successful riding career - including winning a silver medal at the London 2012 Olympics. She married former England rugby player Mike Tindall in 2011 and the couple had their first child, Mia Grace, in 2014. The children of the Princess Royal do not hold a royal title, as they are descended from the female line, but she remains21st in line to the throne.Their father, Mark Phillips, turned down an earldom when he married Princess Anne, so they do not have courtesy titles. Born: 2014 Zara Tindall gave birth to her first child, Mia Grace, in January 2014. Born: 2018 The couple's second child was born on 18 June 2018 at Stroud Maternity Unit, Gloucestershire, weighing 9lb 3oz. Lena Elizabeth was named in honour of her great-grandmother.

"Prime Minister Liz Truss has announced plans to cap average household energy bills at Â£2,500 a year from October The support will last for two years, she announces in the Commons, saying ""this is the moment to be bold"" A typical household's gas and electricity bill had been due to rise from Â£1,971 to Â£3,549 in October Businesses are also getting a support package for six months which will provide ""equivalent support"" After the six-month period, further support will be targeted at ""vulnerable industries"", Truss says The government is also lifting the ban on fracking - which involves extracting gas and oil from shale rock Edited by Jeremy Gahagan and Nathan Williams Our coverage of the government's plan to cap energy bills is coming to a close. During the debate, a statement from the Palace saying that the Queen is under medical supervision was released. Follow our live coverage here. With the debate drawing to a close, here are the main lines from
Liz Truss' announcement on energy bills. As expected, an energy bills price cap of Â£2,500 for the typical
household per year, for the next two years, has been announced. A six-month support package for businesses has also been
announced, with further support for ""vulnerable industries"" after
that period. The ban on fracking will also be lifted - allowing developers to
seek planning permissions where there is local support. Read more on the energy announcementshere. Our colleagues atRadio 5 Livehave been hearing views on the government's plans to tackle energy prices from people around the country. Susanlives near a fracking site in Lancashire, she's concerned about the government's plans to lift the ban on fracking. ""I've experienced huge methane emissions, earth tremors and the disruption that comes with a fracking site,"" she says. ""For me, health and peace of mind are far greater value [than cheaper energy costs]."" Susan is concerned about the government's plans for fracking Philip in Croydonwould like to see the government nationalise ""all sources of oil and gas in UK territories"". ""We've nationalised the pain, so nationalise the profits,"" he says. ""If we take control of our own national resources, we could have a proper domestic energy market... we should look after our own people first."" Ronnie in Hemel Hempsteadbelieves there's ""hypocrisy"" in the government's plan to borrow money. He says when David Cameron came into power ""we were told borrowing at the levels being spoken about would destroy our grandchildren's futures"". ""We were told the borrowing [Labour were proposing at the lest general election] they were talking about would lead the country to economic ruin, but when the Tories want to borrow at this level now, it's fine."" Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent The new Prime Minister Liz Truss has outlined her plans to deal with soaring energy bills faced by households and businesses. At its heart is a move to limit the 80% rise in domestic bills that was earmarked for October. So how much will you pay? Will you have to pay it back? And will you still get cost of living payments? Here's what it means for you. Truss' first major decision would be to protect the profits of big businesses, Blackford continues. He's describing the funding for this plan as a ""Truss tax"", adding that the decision to not increase a windfall tax is the worst decision she could possibly make. There is a difference between fair and an excess, or windfall, profits for companies like Shell and BP. Blackford criticises energy generation firms for paying dividends and buying back their own shares with these profits, rather than investing in infrastructure. More now from Blackford, who says the current system isn't fit for purpose and needs urgent review. He says businesses are facing a fight for survival and the UK government needs to grasp the scale of the emergency. In reality, the one big question is how it would be paid for and who would pay for it, Blackford says. He adds the prime minister has made a political choice to ask families to fund it, rather than businesses. Heading back to the energy debate now, and SNP leader Ian Blackford - who has sent his best wishes to the Queen following the news - is warning about impact of high energy bills. Blackford says this cost crisis puts lives and livelihoods at risk, but that people were left waiting all summer Blackford adds the plan that we've finally heard today falls short of what is needed to address people's costs. He says freezing prices wasn't a choice, but the only political option and setting the cap at Â£2,500 isn't a freeze, but baking in high prices. Speaker of the House Lindsay Hoyle has just interrupted
the energy debate, to say he and the House are sending their best wishes to the Queen -
following an announcement that the monarch is under medical supervision at Balmoral Castle. You can read morein our breaking story. Simon JackBBC Business Editor Consumer support is as expected. A typical household will see their energy bill rise to Â£2,500 in October which will be fixed for two years. A Â£400 rebate takes it down to Â£2,100. Additional
payments of Â£650 for those on qualifying benefits will also stay in place. But
there is no suggestion those payments will be repeated so average households
will see an energy price rise of over 25%. Businesses
offered ""equivalent support"" for a six month period but it is not
clear what that means as they have not yet published the unit cost per unit of
gas and electricity that they are using to generate the domestic cap and cannot
yet confirm whether the same unit cost will be applied to business customers. Business will
need greater clarity on this if they are to be reassured. Conservative MP Theresa May says the energy efficiency of homes needs to be improved, as it would not only reduce demand for energy, but would also help to save the planet. We do need to consider rolling out significant home insulation programme, she adds. Former PM Theresa May congratulates PM Liz Truss on acting so swiftly on energy bills. She welcomes the fact that energy bills action has been coupled with action on energy security. ""The vicious invasion of Ukraine by Russia has indeed shown the necessity of us having our own energy security,"" she says. Ione WellsPolitical Correspondent, BBC News There is a real ideological divide between this new Conservative
leadership and Labourâs. Keir Starmer calls Liz Trussâ opposition to
windfall taxes on oil and gas firms âridiculousâ, but the Tory front bench has
definitively ruled out any more taxes. Starmer himself calls this the big
âdivide.â Itâs a contrast to Boris Johnsonâs cabinet â who did end up
introducing the current windfall tax. Britain needs a fresh start, not a government who protect the profits of energy companies and doubles down on fossil fuels, Starmer says as he ends his stint at the despatch box. The change we need is not the fourth Tory prime minister in six years, but a Labour government, he concludes. If all countries took the approach of squeezing every single
drop out of their fossil fuel reserves, that would be devastating for our
planet, Starmer says. Wind and solar are now nine times cheaper than gas. So we need a
clean energy plan, urgently accelerating the rollout of offshore wine, onshore
wind, solar, nuclear, hydrogen and tidal. Starmer says fracking and a dash for gas in the North Sea will not boost our supply in the short term or energy security. But he adds it will fight our ability to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and stick to net zero commitments. He then reads out (lengthy) quotes from Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng a few months ago, where he argued that fracking and North Sea oil would not reduce wholesale prices. Starmer says doubling down on fossil fuels is a ""ludicrous"" answer to an energy crisis, given the threat that climate change poses to the planet and future generations. Need a recap? Here are the main points of the new PM's plan on energy. Household
bills:  Business
bills:  Paying for the plan:  Energy
supply: We're thick into the debate in the Commons now. But many of you will be wondering: what happens now? Greg Jackson, chief executive and founder of Octopus Energy, says: ""Companies and government are now working through the details
and customers should sit tight and wait to hear from their energy supplier. ""Nothing will change until 1 October and we'll be in touch with everyone
before then."" Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent The prime minister said a fund will be created to support
those who are not covered by a cap. This includes people who use heating oil in their homes,
those who have communal heating schemes, and people in mobile home parks who
pay the park-owner rather than a supplier. More details will come later, but this will be an extremely
complex task. For example, people in park homes do not yet know how they
will receive the Â£400 discount available to everyone â and that was announced
months ago. Expect debate over how people get this money, and how soon. The Labour leader says he is pleased that the principle of a price limit has been accepted. But this support, ""does not come cheap"", he adds. The real question before the house today the government faces, the political question, is who is going to pay? The Treasury estimates that energy companies could make Â£170bn in unexpected windfall profits over the next two years. The head of BP has called this crisis a cash machine for his company, and households are on the other end of that cash machine, their bills are funding these eye-watering profits, says Starmer. ""That's why we've been calling for a windfall tax since January, and it's why we want to see it expanded. ""The consequence is the bill will be picked up by working people."" Repeating arguments he made at Prime Minister's Questions yesterday, the Labour leader says Liz Truss is opposed to windfall taxes and wants to leave vast profits of energy companies on the table. He adds the bill will leave working people footing the bill. Starmer says there is no reason taxing these profits that have come about via market price spikes rather than planning would deter investment. He says her argument against it falls apart at first inspection, adding she is driven by dogma. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The Queen was seen on Tuesday when she appointed Liz Truss as prime minister at Balmoral The Queen is under medical supervision at Balmoral after doctors became concerned for her health, Buckingham Palace has said. All the Queen's children have gathered at her Scottish estate near Aberdeen. ""Following further evaluation this morning, the Queen's doctors are concerned for Her Majesty's health and have recommended she remain under medical supervision,"" a statement said. The Queen is ""comfortable"", it added. It is very unusual for Buckingham Palace to put out a statement like this - it is usually unwilling to provide a commentary on the 96-year-old monarch's medical matters, which are seen as private. Her son, Prince Charles, is at Balmoral with his wife, Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall. Her grandson, the Duke of Cambridge, other sons, the Duke of York and the Earl of Wessex, and his wife Sophie, the Countess of Wessex, arrived at Aberdeen airport just before 16:00 BST. Prince William drove them alone in a car together to the Queen's Scottish estate, a journey of about 40 miles (64km). This video can not be played Watch: Plane carrying senior royals lands in Aberdeen Her daughter Princess Anne was already in Scotland undertaking engagements and is in Balmoral. The Duchess of Cambridge has remained in Windsor with her children on their first full day at school. The Duke of Sussex is travelling separately to Balmoral. A spokeswoman said his wife Meghan was not accompanying him. The US-based couple had been in the UK to attend a charity function. There are clearly pressing concerns for the Queen's health - much more explicitly put than before and without any reference to this only being about difficulties with mobility. There are also warnings against unfounded speculation, such as that she might have had a fall. And on Tuesday she was photographed smiling as she appointed new Prime Minister Liz Truss. But from the last-minute cancellation of what would only have been a virtual meeting of the Privy Council - of senior ministers - there is no mistaking the fragility of the Queen's health. Ms Truss said the ""whole country"" would be ""deeply concerned"" by the news. ""My thoughts - and the thoughts of people across our United Kingdom - are with Her Majesty The Queen and her family at this time,"" she added. Prince William drove the group of royals - including Prince Andrew and Prince Edward - to Balmoral The Queen appointed Ms Truss as prime minister at Balmoral, instead of travelling to London for the event. During her 70-year reign the Queen has typically had an audience with her new prime minister at Buckingham Palace. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, said: ""My prayers, and the prayers of people across the [Church of England] and the nation, are with Her Majesty The Queen today. ""May God's presence strengthen and comfort Her Majesty, her family, and those who are caring for her at Balmoral."" The Queen is also head of state for 14 Commonwealth realms, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the country was ""wishing her well, and sending our best to the Royal Family"". The White House said US President Joe Biden had been briefed and that his and First Lady Jill Biden's thoughts were ""solidly and squarely with the Queen today and her family"". Live updates: Queen's doctors concerned for her health Who is in the UK's Royal Family? How does the Royal Family work? Political leaders send best wishes to Queen News of the Queen's ill-health came as MPs heard details of the government's new plan to help households and businesses with energy costs in the House of Commons. Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Nadhim Zahawi entered the Commons and spoke to Ms Truss. Notes were then passed to the Commons speaker and Labour front bench. The palace statement came minutes later. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he was ""deeply worried"", while Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon sent her thoughts and wishes to the Queen. Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford sent his best wishes on behalf of the people of Wales. The monarch has been on a summer break at her Scottish home since July. Barriers have been placed outside one of the entrances to the estate.

"This video can not be played WATCH: Liz Truss announces energy price guarantee for next two years New Prime Minister Liz Truss will limit energy bill rises for all households for two years as the new prime minister tries to prevent widespread hardship. A typical household energy bill will be capped at Â£2,500 annually until 2024. The huge support scheme could cost up to Â£150bn, but Ms Truss refused to put a figure on it, saying ""extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures"". Businesses will get help, with prices capped for six months, a shorter period of protection than many had hoped for. The help will be for everyone in England, Scotland and Wales with equivalent assistance for Northern Ireland. But there are concerns the measures are not targeted enough, with no additional support for the most vulnerable. As a result, millions are still expected to be in fuel poverty this winter. The energy price cap - the highest amount suppliers are allowed to charge households for every unit of energy they use - had been due to rise to Â£3,549 for a typical household from October. To limit the amount customers' bills go up by, the unit price will be capped, although household energy bills will vary according to how much gas and electricity they use. The government will compensate energy firms for the difference between the wholesale price for gas and electricity they pay and the amount they can charge customers. 'Government help on energy bills is no use to me' What the new energy plan means for you How much are energy bills rising under the new plan? Where does the government borrow billions from? Commenting on what steps households should now take, Greg Jackson, chief executive and founder of Octopus Energy, said firms were still working through the details and customers should ""sit tight and wait to hear from their energy supplier"". ""Nothing will change until 1 October and we'll be in touch with everyone before then."" The dramatic state intervention will be funded by government borrowing, adding to the UK's already large debt pile. The total cost of the support will depend on the cost of energy on the international energy markets, which can be extremely volatile. This comes after Ms Truss rejected calls to extend a windfall tax on gas and oil company profits to pay for the package. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the refusal to fund it with a windfall tax showed she was ""driven by dogma"" and ""it's working people who will pay for that"". Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey accused the government of bringing in a ""phony freeze"" while ""refusing to properly tax the eye-watering profits of oil and gas companies."" ""This will still leave struggling families and pensioners facing impossible choices this winter as energy bills almost double,"" he said. Ms Truss argued it was ""the moment to be bold"". ""We are facing a global energy crisis, and there are no cost-free options,"" she said. Gas prices have soared this year, largely due to the conflict in Ukraine which has reduced supplies of Russian gas. Experts and charities warned that without help with soaring energy bills, lives would have been at risk this winter, with people struggling to afford basic day-to-day living costs. Citizens Advice chief executive Dame Clare Moriarty, told the BBC the package will provide ""much-needed relief for millions"" but said she was concerned it is not going to reverse the trends it was seeing. ""We're seeing problems turn up in the summer, which we would normally expect to be winter."" Ms Truss also outlined plans ""to make sure we have security of [energy] supply for the long-term"". This includes issuing new oil and gas exploration licences for the North Sea and lifting the ban on fracking for shale gas ""where there is local support for it"". In addition the government will: Scrap green levies - which add Â£150 to bills each year - which the Â£2,500 cap accounts for Continue with a previously announced Â£400 energy bills discount for all households. Taken together, the government said this ""will bring costs close to where the energy price cap stands today"". Launch a new oil and gas licensing round as early as next week, boosting production in the North Sea Seek to negotiate lower-priced long-term contracts with renewable and nuclear power companies Launch a joint scheme with the Bank of England to provide emergency support to struggling UK energy firms Launch a review to ensure the UK is meeting its Net Zero 2050 target in ""an economically-efficient way"", given the altered economic landscape. The decision to lift the ban on fracking will be controversial.The practice was halted in 2019- as outlined in the Tory Party 2019 manifesto - amid opposition from environmentalists and local concerns over earth tremors. The scheme to limit energy costs for businesses will also cover public sector groups like schools and charities. It will be in place for six months though it will be reviewed in three month's time ""to consider where this should be targeted to make sure those most in need get support"". The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) welcomed the help but said the announcement was ""sparse on detail"". ""Small businesses' instant reaction is that this is not enough information, yet, for them to plan,"" said Martin McTague, chairman of the FSB. Downing Street said the price cap would boost economic growth and curb inflation by as much as 5%. The rate at which prices rise is currently at a 40-year high of 10.1%, largely driven by soaring energy prices. The energy plan is a huge emergency intervention in keeping with the pandemic rescue package. It will lessen the anticipated pain in households and businesses, but not eliminate it. The recession the economy is heading for should be shallower. But these are the headlines of what the plan promises. It is unprecedented for an announcement of this size, to have so few details on the mechanisms involved, and no details on the costs. There is much up for grabs. Some allowance could be given for the fact the administration is only two days old. But it is clear from our reporting up and down the country that more businesses that have closed could have been saved if this package had come more quickly. And the uncertainty for business will not be settled until the actual unit price of energy is announced. The size of the intervention, which looks well in excess of Â£100bn, looks likely to raise questions about whether the PM can deliver her complete programme of promised immediate tax cuts. Much will depend on negotiations with renewables producers and a plan to buy gas on long-term contracts. There is a long queue of nations currently doing the same. Expect to see the new PM in Oslo, Ottawa and the Gulf before long. The plans for long-term production reflect a strategic decision not to be dependent on imported energy, that will take some time to come to fruition. The idea, however, is to address the root cause of a problem years in the making.

"The group of women worked together to find out the identity of this man, who subjected them to brutal interrogations A Russian police officer's takeaway food order was the breakthrough clue which helped a group of women, who had been terrorised by him, reveal his true identity. For the first time, a BBC investigation tells the story of how they tracked him down. The women, mostly aged between 19 and 25, had attendeda rally in Moscow in Marchagainst Russia's invasion of Ukraine. They were quickly rounded up by officers and put in the back of a police van. Most of them didn't know each other, but despite the circumstances the atmosphere was upbeat. They even set up a Telegram group chat as they travelled across the city to Brateyevo police station. What happened next was far worse than they anticipated. Over the next six hours they suffered verbal and physical abuse that, in some cases, amounted to torture - one woman says she was repeatedly starved of oxygen when a plastic bag was put over her head. Marina (top right) and Anastasia (bottom right) - and in the police van (left) The abuse was carried out by the same unnamed plain-clothes officer - tall, athletic, dressed in a black polo neck. In their group chat, they gave him the nickname the ""man in black"". Two of the women, Marina and Alexandra, secretly recorded audio on their phones. In one, the officer can be heard shouting about his ""total impunity"". But if his aim was to intimidate them into silence, he would fail. This video can not be played Listen to the âman in blackâ shouting insults at Marina and Alexandra while he assaults them After their release, the women discussed on the Telegram group how they could work out who he was. ""If we just kept on living like it didn't happen, if we just published the [recordings] and laid lowâ¦ most likely, they would think they can do it again and that they would be completely unpunished,"" says 22-year-old student Marina. His image was seared in their memories, but they could find no sign of him on police websites. And with no name to go on, social media was a dead end. After more than a fortnight of searching, they were close to giving up. And then the women had a breakthrough. In late March, there was amassive data leak,externalfrom the popular Russian food delivery app Yandex Food. The group had an idea. They began raking through the data to see if there had been any orders to Brateyevo police station over the past year. They discovered there had - by nine different customers. Could one of them have been the ""man in black""? Most of the Yandex data only included first names and a phone number. The group of women used these to find several social media profiles for staff at the police station, but no photos resembled their interrogator. Finally they came to one of the last names on the list: Ivan. A popular Russian name, so one of the most difficult to pin down. Ivan's phone number, however, did reveal a trail online - six classified adverts from the Russian trading website Avito.ru. But most of the adverts only gave them the information they already knew - a first name. One, however - for a Skoda Rapid car sold 10 minutes' drive from Brateyevo police station, posted in 2018 - included the seller's full name: Ivan Ryabov. With a surname, they could search for a picture. And almost immediately, 19-year-old Anastasia came across one she recognised. ""I started crying. I could not believeâ¦ that I managed to do it."" She sent the picture to Marina, Alexandra, and others in the Telegram group, who agreed they had found their ""man in black"". They hope this will finally prompt the authorities to open a criminal investigation. The audio recordings give a chilling insight into the women's abuse. Ryabov can be heard telling Marina to answer his questions before ""I take off my boot and smash you on the head with it."" For 14 minutes, Marina says she was shouted at and kicked by Ryabov - a pistol in her face. Finding My Torturer BBC Eye Investigations tells the story of how these young Russian women came together to expose the identity of their torturer and his commanding officer. Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK Only) Anastasia, waiting outside, remembers hearing the sound of screaming and blows. When she, too, refused to co-operate with the questioning, she says Ryabov beat her over the head with a water bottle, emptied its contents over her, and then pulled a plastic bag over her soaking head where he held it against her nose and mouth for 30-40 seconds at a time. ""You think to yourself - how much longer can I take this?"" she says. Alexandra, 26, also managed to record her abuse, and in her audio we hear Ryabov boast of his total impunity. ""You think we're going to get in trouble for this? Putin told us to kill all of [your type]. That's it! Putin's on our side!"" He then threatens to kill her himself, adding: ""And then they'll give me a bonus for it too."" At least 11 of the detainees say they experienced physical abuse at the hands of the ""man in black"". When the women publicly released the audio recorded on their phones earlier this year, one Russian politician called for action - but the country's Investigative Committee deemed there to be ""insufficient evidence"" to warrant opening a criminal investigation into the case. The women also wanted to know who had authority over Ryabov that day - and why that person wasn't stopped. Anastasia had always felt another man - who the women dubbed the ""man in beige"" - was in charge that evening. Though he wasn't present inside Room 103 - where the women were terrorised - ""all communication took place through him"", she says. One of the detainees had secretly filmed him in the station waiting room. But the shaky video wasn't much to go on. A grab from the video of the ""man in beige"" The BBC obtained an arrest report from 6 March, which was signed by the police station's acting head: Lieutenant Colonel AG Fedorinov. We then found a local newspaper report from 2012 which mentions an Alexander Georgievich Fedorinov, with an accompanying photograph which seemed to match his image. But because the photo was 10 years old, the BBC used facial recognition software to double-check - and found images matching the ""man in beige"" in the video were linked to a social media account in the name of Alexander Fedorinov. That same account was tagged in an online advert for job vacancies at Brateyevo police station. The BBC put the allegations - that police officer Ivan Ryabov initiated and participated in the abuse of detainees, and that this abuse in some cases amounted to torture - to both Ryabov and Fedorinov, and to Russia's Investigative Committee. There was no response. By uncovering the identity of their abuser, Marina, Anastasia and Alexandra hope that some form of justice and accountability will emerge. ""We want to makeâ¦ it possible for the law to affect them,"" says Marina. ""No one can do this to another person, even if he is a government official.""

"The new Prime Minister, Liz Truss, has outlined her plans to deal with soaring energy bills faced by households and businesses. At its heart is a move to limit the 80% rise in domestic bills that was earmarked for October. This is what it means for you. You will still pay for the gas and electricity you use. But the government's Energy Price Guarantee will limit the price that suppliers can charge for each unit of energy. For a typical household - one that uses 12,000 kWh (kilowatt hours) of gas a year, and 2,900 kWh of electricity a year - it means an annual bill will not rise above Â£2,500 from October. Without this intervention, that annual bill would have been Â£3,549 a year. Last winter it was Â£1,277 a year. However, if you use more gas or electricity than that, you will pay more. This guarantee will last for two years. In precise terms, the average unit price for dual fuel customers paying by direct debit will be limited to 34.0p per kilowatt hour (kWh) for electricity and 10.3p per kWh for gas. Standing charges will still see the slight rise planned for October. Not directly on your bill or taxes. However, the government is paying for this by borrowing the money. That adds it to the pot of national debt. The prime minister says the cost will be outlined later this month. In time, that could be paid for through taxation, but at the moment the government will borrow the money on international markets and pay a premium as a result. So-called ""green levies"" will be moved off bills, and again paid for through borrowing on taxation. Yes, these canamount to hundreds of pounds this winter. So far, a first instalment of Â£326 has been paid to low-income households on certain benefits and tax credits. There is also a Â£400 discount on bills for all households over the winter. These payments will only be paid this winter, under current plans, whereas the cap will be in place for two years. So, there will be an effective rise in what householders pay next winter. The government says that the same level of support will be provided to households in Northern Ireland, as it is in the rest of the UK. However, this will require legislation. The prime minister said a fund will be created to support those who are not covered by a cap, but she did not say how big that fund would be. This includes people who use heating oil in their homes, those who have communal heating schemes, and people in mobile home parks who pay the park owner rather than a supplier. More details will come later, but this will be an extremely complex task. The government did say there would be a payment of Â£100 to households across the UK who are not covered by the price guarantee. However, some issues are still outstanding. For example, people in park homes do not yet know how they will receive the Â£400 discount available to everyone - and that was announced months ago. Fixed deals allow you to pay for energy at a set rate for a set period of time, but you are locked in. Plenty of people whose fixed deals have expired in recent months may have considered fixing again, given the outlook of rising energy prices. This has been an extremely expensive option, but one which some understandably chose to take given the eyewatering forecasts of soaring bills. The prime minister did not mention fixed deals in her statement. However, since then, the government has said that fixed rate deals which are higher than than price cap rate will be automatically discounted by 17p per kWh for electricity and 4.2p per kWh for gas at the start of October. That is the equivalent of a Â£1,000 or so reduction for a household using a typical amount of energy. However, it means somebody on a fixed rate could still be paying a higher unit charge than the price cap - if their fix had been much more expensive. There is no automatic right to cancel a fixed deal without a penalty, unless you fixed within the last 14 days. It may be the individuals need to negotiate with their provider. Businesses will get support, with bills capped for six months, a shorter period of protection than many had hoped for. This support will focus on businesses on variable deals, or whose contracts are soon to come to an end.More details are here.

"Gas and electricity bills are going up again on 1 January, when the latest energy price cap takes effect. Customers are encouraged to submit a meter reading to ensure they are charged the correct amount. The energy price cap covers 26 million households in England, Wales and Scotland and is setevery three months,externalby the energy regulator Ofgem. It fixes the maximum price that can be charged for each unit of energy on a standard - or default - tariff for a typical dual-fuel household which pays by direct debit. Between 1 January and 31 March 2025,gas prices will be capped at 6.34p per kilowatt hour (kWh), and electricity at 24.86 per kWh.,external This means the annual bill for a dual-fuel direct debit household using a typical amount of energywill go up to Â£1,738 per year, an increase of Â£21 from the previous cap. Those who pay their bills every three months by cash or cheque will pay Â£1,851. Analysts at forecaster Cornwall Insight, which tracks the energy market, expect prices to fall slightly in April and October 2025, but says thathigh domestic energy prices are likely to be ""the new normal"". The cap does not apply in Northern Ireland, which has its own energy market. Your energy bill depends on the overall amount of gas and electricity you use, and how you pay for it. The type of property you live in, how energy efficient it is, how many people live there and the weather all make a difference. The Ofgem cap is based on a ""typical household"" using 11,500 kWh of gas and 2,700 kWh of electricity a year with a single bill for gas and electricity, settled by direct debit. The vast majority of people pay their bill this way to help spread payments across the year. Those who pay every three months by cash or cheque are charged more. Energy prices could vary at different times of day Submitting a meter reading when the cap changes means you will not be charged for estimated usage at the wrong rate. This is especially important when prices go up. Customers withworking smart metersdo not need to submit a reading as their bill is calculated automatically. Fixed-priced deals offer certainty for a set period - often a year, or longer - but if prices drop, you could be stuck at a higher price. Ofgem says customers who want the security of a set price should consider fixed deals. However, it recommends getting independent advice. The price comparison site Uswitch says it is important to check whether fixed deals have exit fees before signing up and to make sure you fully understand the terms of the contract. Because the price cap changes every three months, it is difficult to know with any certainty whether a fixed tariff is a good deal. The longer the fixed term, the greater the uncertainty. Between January and March, households on prepayment meters will pay slightly less than those on direct debit, with a typical bill of Â£1,690, a rise of Â£21 from the previous quarter. About four million households had prepayment meters in April 2024, according to Ofgem. Many have been in place for years, but some were installed more recently after customers struggled to pay higher bills. Rulesintroduced in November 2023,externalmean suppliers must give customers more opportunity to clear their debts before switching them to a meter. They cannot be installed at all in certain households. Energy firms pay out over force-fitting of meters Standing charges are a fixed daily fee to cover the costs of connecting to a supply. They are typically 61p a day for electricity and 32p a day for gas, although they vary slightly by region. Under the energy price cap, they have risen by 43% since 2019. Campaigners argue standing charges are unfair because they make up a larger proportion of the bill of low energy users. Ofgem has proposed thatenergy firms must provide a choice of price-capped tariffsfrom winter 2025, one which has a standing charge and unit rate - as is the case now - and another with no standing charge but a higher unit rate. Customers would be able to choose which suits them best. Separately, it wants a consistent approach from suppliers on how to deal with unpaid bills totalling Â£3.8bn. Changes to the winter fuel payment mean more than 10 million pensioners are not receiving the money this winter. Previously, it was paid to all pensioners in England and Wales born before 25 September 1957. However, in July, the government said future payments would be made only to those on low incomes who receivedcertain benefits, including pension credit. The 2024 payment - worth Â£200 or Â£300 depending on individual circumstances - is paid automatically to eligible pensioners. However, hundreds of thousands of people who are entitled to pension credit do not claim it, which means they will miss out on the winter fuel payment too. How much is the winter fuel payment and who can still get it? TheÂ£500m Household Support Fund,,externalwhich was introduced in September 2021 to help vulnerable customershas been extended until March 2025. TheWarm Home Discount scheme,externalcontinues to offer a discount to eligible pensioners and low income households. The government'sFuel Direct Scheme,externalcan help people to repay an energy debt directly from their benefit payments. In addition, suppliers must offer customers affordable payment plans or repayment holidays if they are struggling with bills. Most suppliers also offer hardship grants.

"Governments borrow to fund ""day-to-day"" spending, as well as long-term infrastructure projects like the Elizabeth Line The UK government generally spends more than it raises in tax. To fill this gap it borrows money, but that has to be paid back - with interest. The government gets most of its income from taxes. For example, workers payincome tax and national insurance, everyone pays VAT on certain goods, and companies pay tax on profits. It could, in theory, cover all of its spending from taxes, and that sometimes happens. But, if it can't, the government covers the gap by raising taxes, cutting spending or borrowing. Higher taxes mean people have less money to spend, so businesses make less profit, which can be bad for jobs and wages. Lower profits also mean companies pay less tax. So, governments often decide to borrow to boost the economy. They also borrow to pay for big projects, like new railways and roads. How the government raises and spends Â£1 trillion a year The government borrows money by selling financial products called bonds. A bond is a promise to pay money in the future. Most require the borrower to make regular interest payments. UK government bonds - known as ""gilts"" - are normally considered very safe, with little risk the money will not be repaid. Gilts are mainly bought by financial institutions in the UK and abroad, such as pension funds, investment funds, banks and insurance companies. The government sells short and long-term gilts to let it borrow money over different time periods, with varying interest rates. The amount the government borrows fluctuates from month to month. For instance, it tends to borrow less in January, when many people pay a large chunk of their annual tax bill in one go. So, it is more helpful to look across a whole year, or the year-to-date. In the last full financial year, to March 2024, the government borrowed Â£125.1bn. The most recent monthly figures show thegovernment borrowed Â£11.2bn in November 2024,which was Â£3.4bn lower than in the same month the previous year, and the lowest November figure since 2021. Borrowing since March stands at Â£113.2bn, which is the third highest financial year-to-November borrowing total since monthly records began in 1993. The total amount the government owes is called the national debt. It is currently about Â£2.8 trillion - or Â£2,800,000,000,000. That is roughly the same asthe value of all the goods and services produced in the UK in a year, known as the gross domestic product, or GDP. The current level is more than double that seen from the 1980s through to the financial crisis of 2008. The combination of the financial crash and the Covid pandemic pushed the UK's debt up. But, in relation to the size of the economy, UK debt figures are still low compared with much of the last century. They are also less than the equivalent figures for some other leading economies. The larger the national debt, the more interest the government pays. That cost was not as great when interest rates were low during the 2010s, but became more noticeable after the Bank of England started raising interest rates in 2021. The amount of interest the government pays on national debt also varies from month to month. It was Â£3bn in November 2024, the lowest November figure for five years. However, interest rates for long-term borrowing have risen to theirhighest levels this century., with the government paying 5.25% on 30-year gilts. If the government has to set aside more cash for paying debts, it may mean it has less to spend on public services. Some economists fear the government is borrowing too much, at too great a cost. Others argue extra borrowing helps the economy grow faster - generating more tax in the long run. The increase in long-term interest rates seen in January prompted some economists to warn that the government is ""on course"" to miss its own borrowing targets. Labour decided to stick to a rule followed by the previous government that the total amount of money owed must have fallen as a proportion of the UK economy in five years' time. In October's Budget, Chancellor Rachel Reeveschanged the definition of debt that the government would use in the target to enable her to raise more money for investment. It will now track a different, broader measure of debt called public sector net financial liabilities (PSNFL). This includes, for example, the money the government gets from people repaying their student loans. Downing Street said there was ""no doubt about the government's commitment to economic stability"", and that ""meeting our fiscal rules is non-negotiable"". The independentOffice for Budget Responsibility (OBR)- which monitors the government's financial performance - will present its latest economic forecast to Parliament in late March. It has previously warned that public debt could soar as the population ages and tax income falls. In an ageing population, the proportion of people of working age drops, meaning the government takes less in tax while paying out more in pensions. Budget 2024: Key points at a glance Rachel Reevesâ tax-raising Budget will affect you for years Debtis the total amount of money owed by the government that has built up over years. Thedeficitis the gap between the government's income and the amount it spends. When a government spends less than its income, it has what is known as a surplus. Debt rises when there is a deficit, and falls in those years when there is a surplus.

"Prime Minister Liz Truss has appointed her new cabinet, hours after taking over at 10 Downing Street. For the first time none of the ""great offices of state"" is held by a white man, with Suella Braverman as home secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng as chancellor and James Cleverly as foreign secretary. Here is a guide to the new faces and role changes. Liz Truss became prime minister on 6 September 2022, replacing Boris Johnson who was in post for slightly more than three years. She was not the first choice of Conservative MPs - but she was the clear winner in a ballot of Tory members, who had the final say. Truss has been a government minister since 2012, and held cabinet posts under David Cameron, Theresa May and Johnson, most recently as foreign secretary. A Remain supporter at the 2016 EU referendum, who began her political journey at Oxford University as a Liberal Democrat, she is now an enthusiastic Brexiteer who has vowed to get back to traditional tax-cutting Tory values. Truss, who has two children, was elected to Parliament as MP for South West Norfolk in 2010 after serving as deputy director of think tank Reform. ThÃ©rÃ¨se Coffey has been appointed health secretary, taking over from Stephen Barclay who had only been in the role for two months, and will also be deputy prime minister. The former work and pensions secretary is a long-time friend of Liz Truss and was closely involved in her leadership campaign. Coffey, who was elected MP for Suffolk Coastal in 2010, previously served in a number of roles including environment minister, Commons deputy leader and assistant whip. A devout Roman Catholic, she was asked about her views on abortion after the recent US Supreme Court ruling and said the law was not going to change in the UK - although she added she would prefer people not to have abortions. The former Mars and BBC employee is a member of the Campaign for Real Ale with a love of karaoke, and lists her interests as watching football, gardening and music. Kwasi Kwarteng was chancellor for 38 days before being asked by the prime minister to stand aside after a turbulent few weeks for the UK economy. The former business secretary is a close friend and ally of Liz Truss, and backed her successful leadership campaign. But his ""mini-budget"" pledging Â£45bn of tax cuts, funded by borrowing, was followed by market turbulence and an intervention from the Bank of England. His departure means he is the second shortest-serving UK chancellor since the Second World War. Kwarteng, who got a scholarship to Eton and studied at Cambridge, worked in finance before his time in politics, and has written a book about the legacy of the British Empire. James Cleverly is the new foreign secretary, taking over Liz Trussâs former department. It wonât be a totally new department for him - heâs been a foreign minister before, for the Middle East and North Africa, and later for Europe and North America. He most recently served as education secretary under Boris Johnson. Cleverly was in the Territorial Army and went to Sandhurst and, outside of work, enjoys painting model soldiers and hanging out with his border terriers. Heâll have a busy brief ahead as foreign secretary with the ongoing war in Ukraine and the UK governmentâs current plans to override parts of the Northern Ireland protocol â part of the Brexit deal agreed with the EU. Suella Braverman has nabbed one of the âgreat offices of stateâ as home secretary, tasked with things like the plan to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda. Sheâs a barrister who was previously the attorney general and ran to be the leader herself in the Tory leadership contest. Her parents emigrated to the UK in the 1960s from Kenya and Mauritius, and both spent time in local politics â with her mother being a councillor for 16 years. She has two children, studied law at Cambridge, and loves sushi. Braverman was the first cabinet minister to take maternity leave â after the law was changed so that cabinet ministers could receive paid maternity leave, having previously been expected to resign their posts. Ben Wallace remains the defence secretary, a post he's held since July 2019. While almost all the other posts have seen a big mix-up, this continuity was anticipated given he's been leading the response to the war in Ukraine. He's popular with Tory members - and was once considered a favourite to replace Boris Johnson - but chose not to stand in the leadership contest. While some of the characters in Truss's new cabinet are more divisive in the Tory party, Wallace is pretty widely respected across the parliamentary party with many colleagues seeing him as a safe pair of hands. During his eight-year spell in the Army, he served in Germany, Cyprus, Belize and Northern Ireland - where he helped thwart an IRA bomb attack. Nadhim Zahawi has been a fast riser in the party - gaining support and public recognition in his role as vaccines minister during the pandemic. As chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster he'll be responsible for running the Cabinet Office, the department that supports the prime minister and basically helps departments work together better on issues that involve more than one. He'll also be the equalities minister. Zahawi was previously chancellor of the exchequer but for only two months - having been promoted when Rishi Sunak resigned - and pretty swiftly afterwards said Boris Johnson should resign. He's a former child refugee who fled Iraq with his parents in the 1970s and co-founded the market research firm YouGov. He is now believed to be one of the richest politicians in the Commons. Simon Clarke has been promoted to the full cabinet as levelling up, housing and communities secretary, taking over from Greg Clark, who replaced Michael Gove in July. He was previously chief secretary to the Treasury but chose to support Liz Truss for the leadership rather than his former boss Rishi Sunak. The MP for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland was previously a minister in the housing, communities and local government department and describes himself as a lifelong Boro fan. Clarke, who has agoraphobia, is a qualified solicitor who worked as a policy specialist on health and education before being elected in 2017. Jacob Rees-Mogg has been given the role of business (and energy) secretary and his appointment certainly signals the potential direction of travel for this government. One of the Conservative Party's highest profile Brexiteers - previously in cabinet as Brexit opportunities and government efficiency minister - he's very pro-deregulation of business and wants to remove a host of rules and regulations post-Brexit. He's also been a critic in the past of what he's called âclimate alarmismâ and has been very pro-fracking. One of the first MPs to back Liz Truss for the leadership, Rees-Mogg set up his own investment management company in 2007, is a father-of-six, and describes himself as an avid cricket fan. Kemi Badenoch has entered the cabinet as international trade secretary after surprising many by reaching the last four in the leadership contest. The former minister in the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities and equalities minister, who did not endorse any of her rivals in the leadership race, replaces Anne-Marie Trevelyan. Badenoch, who has been outspoken on issues such as gender-neutral toilets which she opposes, stood on an ""anti-woke"" platform and argued for the state to be slimmed down. The former software engineer worked in banking and later as a director of the Spectator magazine before being elected to the London Assembly. She became MP for Saffron Walden in Essex in 2017, and lists her interests as including engineering and technology, social mobility and integration. Chloe Smith replaces new Health Secretary ThÃ©rÃ¨se Coffey as work and pensions secretary. She had been a minister in the department since September 2021 and was an early supporter of Liz Trussâs leadership bid. In June 2021 the mother-of-two announced she had been given the all clear from breast cancer after her diagnosis the previous November and says she is now back to full health and full of energy. A keen cyclist, Smith highlights her interest in transport and her work to help reduce youth unemployment in her constituency of Norwich North. Before entering parliament in 2009 - following a by-election sparked by the resignation of the sitting Labour MP after the expenses scandal - she worked for accountancy and professional service firm Deloitte. Alok Sharma will stay on as president for COP26, the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference, working in the Cabinet Office. This is pretty expected - as the role will expire soon. But what will be interesting to watch is how he leaves when it does. He's previously warned he would ""quit"" if the new prime minister scraps any of the UK's commitments to net zero. The new Business and Energy Secretary Jacob Rees-Mogg has previously expressed scepticism at the need to fight climate change, so this new working relationship will be one to watch. Brandon Lewis is in the cabinet for a third time, this time in the role of justice secretary, replacing Dominic Raab. The former Northern Ireland secretary, who resigned in July, initially backed Nadhim Zahawi for the leadership but endorsed Liz Truss at the start of August. He had previously been party chairman and minister without portfolio in Theresa Mayâs cabinet and served as a minister in several departments under May, David Cameron, Boris Johnson. A qualified barrister and former company director, Lewis was a borough councillor in Brentwood for 10 years - five as leader - before entering parliament. The father-of-two, who became Great Yarmouth MP in 2010, took up triathlon the year after he was elected and has completed two London Marathons. Kit Malthouse replaces new Foreign Secretary James Cleverly as education secretary. The former chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, responsible for running the Cabinet Office, did not say who he was supporting in the leadership race. He came to the fore in the Brexit debate, when his name was put to a so-called compromise plan to replace Theresa May's proposed Northern Ireland backstop with ""alternative arrangements"". Malthouse was a deputy mayor of London from 2008, serving under Boris Johnson, and became MP for North West Hampshire in 2015. A chartered accountant who has run a number of small businesses, the father-of-three lists his interests as including gardening, reading and watching modern dance. Ranil Jayawardena has become environment secretary, taking over from George Eustice. He was previously a minister in the international trade department, working for Liz Truss before she became foreign secretary, and was an early supporter of her leadership bid. Jayawardena, who has three children, used to work for Lloyds Bank and was also a councillor in Hampshire. He entered the Commons as MP for North East Hampshire in 2015. Anne-Marie Trevelyan has become transport secretary, replacing Grant Shapps. She had previously been international trade secretary, replacing Liz Truss in the role in 2021, and before that had been international development secretary but lost her place in the cabinet when the department was scrapped. An outspoken Brexiteer who resigned from a previous junior ministerial role in 2018 in protest at Theresa Mayâs Brexit withdrawal deal, she supported Truss in the leadership race. The former chartered accountant entered the Commons as MP for Berwick-upon-Tweed in 2015 and describes herself as having a passion for singing. Chris Heaton-Harris has been promoted to the cabinet as Northern Ireland secretary, replacing Shailesh Vara who only took on the role in July. The former chief whipâs new position was one that initially proved hard to fill, and certainly is regarded by some as a bit of a poisoned chalice right now - the nation is currently without a functioning devolved government. One of his key priorities will be resolving tensions over the Northern Ireland protocol - part of the Brexit deal that Liz Truss wants to override - which the DUP has argued is necessary if it is to re-enter into power sharing in Northern Ireland. The qualified football referee describes himself as a fierce Eurosceptic but may well need to engage with the EU in negotiations about this. Before becoming a politician, Heaton-Harris ran his family's wholesale fruit and vegetable business in New Covent Garden Market. Alister Jack remains secretary of state for Scotland in Liz Trussâs first cabinet, a role he has held since Boris Johnson became prime minister in 2019. The former government whip did not reveal who he supported in the leadership contest. Before entering parliament as MP for Dumfries and Galloway in 2017, Jack was a businessman who founded tent-hire and self-storage companies. Jack, who has three grown up children, is also a dairy farmer and grows Christmas trees. Robert Buckland remains secretary of state for Wales, continuing in the role he took on after Simon Hartâs resignation in July. The former barrister had previously been in the cabinet, as justice secretary, between July 2019 and September 2021 and is also a former solicitor general. He previously backed Rishi Sunak for Tory leader, before switching to Liz Truss, which made him some foes among Sunak's camp who accused him privately of serving his own interests. He is Welsh, born in Llanelli, but represents a seat in South Swindon rather than in Wales - which isn't usual practice and could prove controversial. Buckland has twin children and says his interests include music, wine, political history and watching rugby and cricket. Penny Mordaunt has returned to the cabinet as leader of the House of Commons, responsible for delivery of the governmentâs legislative programme, replacing Mark Spencer. She endorsed Liz Truss after nearly beating her into the final two of the Conservative leadership race. Most recently a trade minister, the naval reservist made history when she became the UK's first female defence secretary in 2019 and had also been in cabinet in 2017 as international development secretary. The former magicianâs assistant is perhaps best known outside Westminster for appearing on ITV's celebrity diving show Splash! Before becoming MP for Portsmouth North in 2010 she was a press officer for Kensington and Chelsea Council and the Freight Transport Association, and a director of the Big Lottery Fund and Diabetes UK. Lord True has been named leader of the House of Lords, responsible for delivery of the governmentâs legislative programme in the Upper House. A former Cabinet Office minister, he replaces Baroness Evans who had held the position since 2016. Before being made a life peer in 2010, True had been leader of the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames and before that had worked in John Majorâs policy unit when he was prime minister. A fluent Italian speaker, who has previously lived and studied in the country, he lists his interests as including history, gardening and sport. Michelle Donelan has been appointed culture secretary, giving her a second chance to make her mark in cabinet following her resignation two days into the job of education secretary in July. The former higher and further education minister replaces Nadine Dorries, having backed Liz Truss after initially supporting her former boss Nadhim Zahawi and then Penny Mordaunt in the leadership race. Previously a government whip, Donelan worked in the media and entertainment industry before entering parliament, including a period as communications manager at professional wrestling firm WWE. The MP for Chippenham, first elected in 2015, says she enjoys walking her dog in her limited spare time. Jake Berry is the new minister without portfolio and Conservative party chairman, replacing Andrew Stephenson. He will be responsible for trying to gear the party up for the next election - Stephenson's predecessor Oliver Dowden resigned after a bruising set of by-elections for the Conservative party earlier this year. Berry will have to engage with Tory associations around the country (some of which weren't particularly happy at Boris Johnson's ousting), and help unite the party after months of infighting. He was previously Northern Powerhouse minister and has been chairman of the Northern Research Group, representing many of the Tory MPs who won seats in traditional Labour heartlands in 2019. The group, and Berry in particular, have pushed the government repeatedly on what it is doing to âlevel upâ and invest in those kinds of areas, which will likely form a big part of any future election strategy of his. Wendy Morton has been appointed chief whip, responsible for party discipline and ensuring Conservative MPs vote along party lines, and will attend cabinet. The former assistant whip backed Liz Truss at the start of the leadership contest and replaces Chris Heaton-Harris in the role. Morton, who has also been a transport and Foreign Office minister, says her interests include walking, cookery, art deco and ceramics. She was first elected MP for the West Midlands constituency of Aldridge-Brownhills in 2015, having missed out to Trussâs rival Rishi Sunak in a bid to become the party candidate for Richmond in 2014. Chris Philp has been appointed chief secretary to the Treasury, attending cabinet, and takes over from new Levelling Up Secretary Simon Clarke. The former digital minister initially backed Sajid Javid in the leadership race but endorsed Liz Truss in July. Philp, who has also held junior roles in the Home Office and Ministry of Justice, has spoken of how the NHS saved the lives of his twins after they were born very prematurely at 25 weeks. He was elected MP for Croydon South in 2015. Michael Ellis has been appointed attorney general - the chief legal adviser to the government - and can attend cabinet. He replaces new Home Secretary Suella Braverman, having previously filled in for her when she went on maternity leave in 2021. A former Cabinet Office minister and paymaster general, Ellis supported Liz Trussâs rival Rishi Sunak in the Conservative leadership race. Ellis worked as a barrister for 17 years before entering parliament and his legal experience has previously led to him getting the role of solicitor general for England and Wales in 2019. He was elected MP for Northampton North in 2010. Edward Argar will attend cabinet after being named paymaster general and Cabinet Office minister, replacing new Attorney General Michael Ellis. The former health minister, who resigned in July, supported Liz Truss in the leadership race after initially backing ex-Health Secretary Sajid Javid. Before entering parliament he worked in management consultancy and communications at various companies including outsourcing firm Serco and was a city councillor in Westminster. He has been MP for Charnwood since 2015 and lists his interests as including gardening, tennis and watching cricket. Vicky Ford has become development minister at the Foreign Office and will attend cabinet. The former MEP and South Cambridgeshire local councillor was an early supporter of Liz Truss in the leadership race. Before entering politics she worked as managing director of an international bank and was involved in raising money for infrastructure projects in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Ford, who has three children, was elected MP for Chelmsford in 2017 and lists her interests as including cricket, fly fishing, gardening and singing. Tom Tugendhat will attend cabinet as security minister in the Home Office, after reaching the final five in the Conservative leadership race. The former Territorial Army officer, who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, has been chairman of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee since 2017 but this is his first ministerial post. His backing of Liz Truss after being eliminated from the leadership race was surprising to many in the Conservative party - given he's always been considered part of the more âcentristâ One Nation group of Tory MPs. Tugendhat will now sit in a government largely skewed to the right-wing of the party. He was highly critical of the withdrawal from Afghanistan by Western forces in 2021, and of Boris Johnson during his premiership, but now he's in a government role his outspoken interventions are likely to be toned down. James Heappey will continue as minister for the armed forces, and take on the veterans brief, in the Ministry of Defence. He'll now attend cabinet too though - the top table of government ministers. He's a former soldier who spent 10 years in the Army, serving in Afghanistan, Iraq and Northern Ireland, and his profile rose significantly during the UK's withdrawal from Afghanistan and more recently the Ukraine war. He's considered a strong communicator and he, like his boss Ben Wallace who is staying on as defence secretary, does seem to bridge divisions across the Tory party factions. Heappey describes himself as a very keen sportsman who also loves to cook. Graham Stuart has become climate minister in the business department and will also attend cabinet. The former Foreign Office and international trade minister, who has also been a government whip, supported Liz Truss in the leadership race. He describes himself as a keen cyclist and says his interests include football, economics, motorcycling and punk rock. Stuart, who set up a publishing business after leaving university, was first elected MP for the East Yorkshire constituency of Beverley and Holderness in 2005. Newcomers includes ministers who did not attend the most recent cabinet. Click hereif you cannot see the Cabinet Guide There was quite a big turnover in Ms Truss's reshuffle, with several high-profile members of the previous cabinet leaving. The replacements include 13 new members who have taken up cabinet roles for the first time. After all the comings and goings, there are now two more women serving in the cabinet than there were under Boris Johnson, taking the total to nine. That makes up 30% overall, which is the same as the first cabinets under Gordon Brown and Theresa May. As for the education of those assembled by Ms Truss, 68% of them went to private schools, up slightly when compared with Mr Johnson's 2019 cabinet and up greatly when compared with Theresa May's in 2016. At 35%, Ms Truss's new cabinet has the lowest proportion of members who were educated at Oxford or Cambridge since Tony Blair's first cabinet in 1997.

"This video can not be played New Prime Minister Liz Truss and Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer have faced each other at Prime Minister's Questions. It was Truss's first full day in the job, and the first time she had answered questions in the House of Commons as prime minister. Starmer began by congratulating Truss on her appointment as PM. Then it was down to business. He immediately challenged Truss on her being against extra taxation on energy company profits. Truss said she was against a windfall tax because she believed it put companies off investing in the UK. Watch Truss and Starmer's first PMQs - in full.

"This video can not be played Therese Coffey: Things said on social media don't worry me It's 08:00 in the morning and the second most powerful woman in Westminster is giving one of her first interviews in her new role at the apex of government. As she's grilled about her new job, she suddenly seems distracted as she grabs for her mobile phone. ""I've just realised my alarm is going off on my phone,"" says Therese Coffey,live on LBC Radio,external. ""You're getting a bit of Dr Dre."" The unmistakable staccato opening keys of Dr Dre's 1999 hit Still D.R.E. ring out as Ms Coffey chuckles and admits ""it's just an eight o'clock alarm"". She regains her composure and the interview continues. Meet the new health secretary and deputy prime minister - a music and football-loving Tory MP with a reputation for partying as hard as she works. A long-time ally of new Prime Minister Liz Truss, Ms Coffey has been given one of the most challenging briefs in government: fixing the multiple crises afflicting the NHS. In her first speech as prime minister, Ms Truss said putting ""our health service on a firm footing"" was one of her three early priorities. The fact Ms Truss has appointed one of her strongest supporters to that role indicates how seriously the prime minister is taking this particular priority. New cabinet: Who is in Liz Truss's top team? Kwasi Kwarteng: Chancellor who likes a challenge Can Coffey deliver her NHS A, B, C and D? With 6.6 million people in queues for treatment, NHS backlogs - as well growing ambulance waiting times and staff vacancies - will be at the top of her to-do list. Her plan to sort it out? ""My focus is on A, B, C, D,"" Ms Coffey told the BBC. ""That stands for ambulances, backlogs, care and doctors and dentists."" Focusing on social care and freeing up space in hospitals ""is going to be critical"", she said. Given her cabinet experience as work and pensions secretary, Ms Coffey will believe she's up to the task entrusted to her by Ms Truss. Close friends since they were elected as Tory MPs in 2010, Ms Truss and Ms Coffey have risen through the political ranks together. Their friendship has proved fruitful for their political careers. Both attended Oxford University, with Ms Coffey studying chemistry (as former Tory Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher did) and cutting her political teeth in the Oxford Union debating society. Ms Coffey was born in 1971 in Lancashire and educated in Liverpool. She has attributed her Conservative political persuasions to her experiences of growing up in the city during the 1970s and 80s. Speaking tothe BBC's Political Thinking podcastin 2020, Ms Coffey criticised the Labour Militant council of the 1980s and said the rest of the country ""seemed to be getting on rather well"" under the prime minister at the time, Mrs Thatcher. At the start of her professional life, Ms Coffey worked in several roles for confectionary giant Mars and as a finance manager at the BBC. Elected for the safe Tory seat of Suffolk Coastal, her parliamentary career began in 2010. Since then, she has served in the governments of Theresa May, Boris Johnson and now Ms Truss. Before becoming deputy PM, her most prominent role was secretary of state at the Department for Work and Pensions, a post she held from September 2019 until this week. In that role her mettle was tested in September last year, when she defended the scrapping of a Â£20 weekly uplift to Universal Credit payments introduced during the pandemic. In remarks criticised as out of touch, Ms Coffey said benefits recipients could make the money back by working two extra hours a week. This video can not be played Therese Coffey defended the phasing-out of the Universal Credit uplift When she was linked with a senior role in Ms Truss's government, Ms Coffey and her voting record on certain issues came under renewed scrutiny. A practising Catholic, Ms Coffey has previously voted against extending abortion care, saying earlier this year she would ""prefer that people didn't have abortions but I am not going to condemn people that do"". The British Pregnancy Advisory Servicehas called the new health secretary's record on abortion rights ""deeply concerning"". But Ms Coffey told the BBC abortion access already available in England and Wales will continue while she was in post. Similarly controversial was her row with Manchester United star Marcus Rashford last year, after he forced the government to extend its free school meal voucher scheme. On his campaign, Rashford tweeted: ""When you wake up this morning and run your shower, take a second to think about parents who have had their water turned off during lockdown."" In reply, Ms Coffey posted on Twitter: ""Water cannot be disconnected though."" Expressing concern at her response, Rashford urged MPs to ""put rivalries aside"" and help struggling households. Yet Ms Coffey has insisted she doesn't pay much attention to social media. When asked about social media posts circulating about her, the health secretary said: ""I don't tend to look at social media."" Such comments, she said, do not worry her. Ms Coffey seems comfortable with the unconventional political persona she has cultivated. In Westminster, her karaoke nights are the stuff of legend, with Ms Truss known to be a regular attendee in the past. Ms Coffey's enthusiasm for karaoke was on full display at the Tory conference in October last year, when she was filmed belting out a version of (I've Had) The Time Of My Life and other pop anthems. Football - namely Liverpool FC - is another of her passions. She is a regular at Anfield - Liverpool FC's stadium - and even followed the team to Paris to watch their defeat to Real Madrid in the Champions League final earlier this year. She was also pictured alongside Ms Truss at Wembley, where they cheered on England's Lionesses in their Women's Euro 2022 victory against Germany. Ms Truss and Ms Coffey were at Wembley to watch the Euro 2022 final Other pictures of Ms Coffey have been less flattering. One, taken at a Spectator magazine party in 2015, showed her toking a large cigar and swilling a glass of champagne. But despite the occasional gaffe, Ms Coffey has been described in glowing terms by her colleagues. Nadine Dorries, the former culture secretary, has said ""nothing ever goes wrong"" in a department led by Ms Coffey, and friends in Westminster cite the new deputy PM's tireless work ethic. Unmarried with no children, Ms Coffey is a private person. She's never been shy about showing her loyalty to Ms Truss though. Her tweet marking Ms Truss's elevation to prime minister was a case in point. ""Brilliant news that @trussliz is now our prime minister,"" Ms Coffey wrote. It was a retweet of a post shared by Ms Coffey almost exactly 10 years ago to celebrate the promotion of a friend to a junior ministerial role. The friend was Liz Truss. Allow Twitter content?

"The Queen was seen on Tuesday when she appointed Liz Truss as prime minister at Balmoral The Queen is under medical supervision at Balmoral after doctors became concerned for her health, Buckingham Palace has said. All the Queen's children have gathered at her Scottish estate near Aberdeen. ""Following further evaluation this morning, the Queen's doctors are concerned for Her Majesty's health and have recommended she remain under medical supervision,"" a statement said. The Queen is ""comfortable"", it added. It is very unusual for Buckingham Palace to put out a statement like this - it is usually unwilling to provide a commentary on the 96-year-old monarch's medical matters, which are seen as private. Her son, Prince Charles, is at Balmoral with his wife, Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall. Her grandson, the Duke of Cambridge, other sons, the Duke of York and the Earl of Wessex, and his wife Sophie, the Countess of Wessex, arrived at Aberdeen airport just before 16:00 BST. Prince William drove them alone in a car together to the Queen's Scottish estate, a journey of about 40 miles (64km). This video can not be played Watch: Plane carrying senior royals lands in Aberdeen Her daughter Princess Anne was already in Scotland undertaking engagements and is in Balmoral. The Duchess of Cambridge has remained in Windsor with her children on their first full day at school. The Duke of Sussex is travelling separately to Balmoral. A spokeswoman said his wife Meghan was not accompanying him. The US-based couple had been in the UK to attend a charity function. There are clearly pressing concerns for the Queen's health - much more explicitly put than before and without any reference to this only being about difficulties with mobility. There are also warnings against unfounded speculation, such as that she might have had a fall. And on Tuesday she was photographed smiling as she appointed new Prime Minister Liz Truss. But from the last-minute cancellation of what would only have been a virtual meeting of the Privy Council - of senior ministers - there is no mistaking the fragility of the Queen's health. Ms Truss said the ""whole country"" would be ""deeply concerned"" by the news. ""My thoughts - and the thoughts of people across our United Kingdom - are with Her Majesty The Queen and her family at this time,"" she added. Prince William drove the group of royals - including Prince Andrew and Prince Edward - to Balmoral The Queen appointed Ms Truss as prime minister at Balmoral, instead of travelling to London for the event. During her 70-year reign the Queen has typically had an audience with her new prime minister at Buckingham Palace. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, said: ""My prayers, and the prayers of people across the [Church of England] and the nation, are with Her Majesty The Queen today. ""May God's presence strengthen and comfort Her Majesty, her family, and those who are caring for her at Balmoral."" The Queen is also head of state for 14 Commonwealth realms, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the country was ""wishing her well, and sending our best to the Royal Family"". The White House said US President Joe Biden had been briefed and that his and First Lady Jill Biden's thoughts were ""solidly and squarely with the Queen today and her family"". Live updates: Queen's doctors concerned for her health Who is in the UK's Royal Family? How does the Royal Family work? Political leaders send best wishes to Queen News of the Queen's ill-health came as MPs heard details of the government's new plan to help households and businesses with energy costs in the House of Commons. Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Nadhim Zahawi entered the Commons and spoke to Ms Truss. Notes were then passed to the Commons speaker and Labour front bench. The palace statement came minutes later. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he was ""deeply worried"", while Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon sent her thoughts and wishes to the Queen. Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford sent his best wishes on behalf of the people of Wales. The monarch has been on a summer break at her Scottish home since July.

"Face tattoos, or moko, have been a part of Maori culture for generations Social media platform Snapchat has removed a feature which allowed users to apply traditional Maori tattoos on their faces. The filters were pulled after their discovery prompted an outcry in New Zealand's indigenous Maori community. Maori people consider tattoo art as sacred, and it is taken as an important marker of the wearer's identity. The move follows local media reports that the filters were proliferating on social media. Radio New Zealand,externalshowed images of users applying filters with names like ""Maori Face Tattoo"" and ""Maori"" on popular platform Instagram. A statement from Snap, which owns the Snapchat platform, confirmed that the filter and a duplicate had been removed from their platform. Snapchat filters - which the company refers to as Lenses - uses Snap-owned software Looksery that allows users to modify their features in real time. Lenses are user-generated and can be freely shared and used by others on the platform. ""We encourage our community to create Lenses that are inclusive and any shared on Snapchat must comply with our community guidelines,"" Snap told the BBC in the statement. ""These are clear that we prohibit content that demeans, defames, or promotes discrimination."" Meta, which owns Instagram, had not responded by the time of publication. Facial tattoos, or moko, have been a part of Maori culture for centuries. They are carved into the skin using chisels in an important ritual, and are used as a means to mark each wearer's unique genealogy and heritage. Facial patterns are also gendered, with men's tattoos extending from forehead to throat, while women's tattoos usually extend from the lips to the chin. As a result, no two tattoos are identical and the mass application of the same filter across many different social media users' faces contributed to the outcry. Book pulled after NZ author criticises Maori tattoo Maori tribe tells anti-vaxxers to stop using haka There has been a resurgence in interest in moko among both Maori men and women. Since the 2000s, moko has become increasingly seen and accepted as part of mainstream New Zealand thanks to a new generation of tattoo practitioners, according to theMuseum of New Zealand,external.

"Cary Yan (50) and Gina Zhou (34) bribed politicians to try and create a special zone in the Marshall Islands, US prosecutors say A Chinese couple plotted to set up a mini-state on the Marshall Islands in the Pacific, bribing MPs and officials along the way, US prosecutors say. The man and woman tried to persuade lawmakers to set up a ""Semi-Autonomous Region"" (SAR) on a remote atoll. Such a zone would have expanded foreign access to the Pacific nation, which was administered by the US until 1979. The Marshall Islands government is yet to fully address the accusations, despite calls from opposition parties. But US authorities say the defendants - Cary Yan and Gina Zhou - undermined the island nation's sovereignty. Their efforts saw bills supporting the SAR's creation debated in the Marshall Islands' parliament in 2018 and 2020, US prosecutors say. Prosecutors allege several Marshall Island lawmakers,unidentified in the charge sheet,external, voted for the bills after receiving bribes ranging from US$7,000 to $22,000 (Â£6,100 to Â£19,000). The pair were detained in Thailand in 2020 and extradited to the US last week. ""Yan and Zhou's bribes blatantly flouted the sovereignty of the Republic of the Marshall Islands and its legislature,"" said US Attorney Damian Williams for the Southern District of New York. The Marshall Islands, a chain of islands located between Hawaii and Australia, gained independence in 1979 after being under US administration for four decades. It remains a key strategic base for Washington in the Pacific, where the US has some security alliances in place but China is seeking to expand its influence. Prosecutors say the two defendants operated a New York-based NGO through which they paid and liaised with Marshall Islands officials. Starting in 2016, they contacted island representatives in a bid to create a SAR on the Rongelap atoll - an area abandoned following US hydrogen bomb testing in the 1950s. US authorities say Mr Yan and Ms Zhao aimed to ""significantly change the laws on the island"", such as by cutting taxes and relaxing immigration restrictions, to attract foreign investment. They allege the pair wined and dined at least six Marshall Island officials and lawmakers, paying for flights and hotels in New York as well as in Hong Kong, where the officials attended a conference promoting the SAR. Island trip lays bare US-China tussle in the Pacific Have China's Pacific ambitions been thwarted? Solomon Islands halts foreign naval visits Pacific Islands urge unity in face of China ambition One official who accepted money then appointed Mr Yan as a special adviser to the Marshall Islands. The pair also became naturalised Marshall Island citizens. In 2018, lawmakers who had taken bribes introduced a bill supporting the proposed SAR into parliament, US prosecutors say. ""The defendants offered and provided a series of bribes and other incentives to obtain the support of legislators for the bill,"" the US Justice Department indictment sheet reads. However, the bill failed to pass in parliament after firm opposition from the island's then president, Hilda Heine. Ms Heine around that time had accused opponents of working on China's behalf and attempting to secure the atoll to turn it into a ""country within a country"". But Ms Heine lost the 2019 general election. A new parliament in 2020 then passed a resolution which endorsed the concept of the SAR - paving the way for a new bill to establish it. However later that year Mr Yan and Ms Zhao were detained in Thailand. They have been charged in the US with foreign corruption, money laundering and bribery offences. On Monday, former president Ms Heine added her voice to those demanding the Marshall Islands government address the issue. ""What is the Nitijela [parliament] and the government going to do about this big black eye for Marshall Islands?"" she asked, according to local media.

"Prime Minister Liz Truss has announced plans to cap average household energy bills at Â£2,500 a year from October The support will last for two years, she announces in the Commons, saying ""this is the moment to be bold"" A typical household's gas and electricity bill had been due to rise from Â£1,971 to Â£3,549 in October Businesses are also getting a support package for six months which will provide ""equivalent support"" After the six-month period, further support will be targeted at ""vulnerable industries"", Truss says The government is also lifting the ban on fracking - which involves extracting gas and oil from shale rock Edited by Jeremy Gahagan and Nathan Williams Our coverage of the government's plan to cap energy bills is coming to a close. During the debate, a statement from the Palace saying that the Queen is under medical supervision was released. Follow our live coverage here. With the debate drawing to a close, here are the main lines from
Liz Truss' announcement on energy bills. As expected, an energy bills price cap of Â£2,500 for the typical
household per year, for the next two years, has been announced. A six-month support package for businesses has also been
announced, with further support for ""vulnerable industries"" after
that period. The ban on fracking will also be lifted - allowing developers to
seek planning permissions where there is local support. Read more on the energy announcementshere. Our colleagues atRadio 5 Livehave been hearing views on the government's plans to tackle energy prices from people around the country. Susanlives near a fracking site in Lancashire, she's concerned about the government's plans to lift the ban on fracking. ""I've experienced huge methane emissions, earth tremors and the disruption that comes with a fracking site,"" she says. ""For me, health and peace of mind are far greater value [than cheaper energy costs]."" Susan is concerned about the government's plans for fracking Philip in Croydonwould like to see the government nationalise ""all sources of oil and gas in UK territories"". ""We've nationalised the pain, so nationalise the profits,"" he says. ""If we take control of our own national resources, we could have a proper domestic energy market... we should look after our own people first."" Ronnie in Hemel Hempsteadbelieves there's ""hypocrisy"" in the government's plan to borrow money. He says when David Cameron came into power ""we were told borrowing at the levels being spoken about would destroy our grandchildren's futures"". ""We were told the borrowing [Labour were proposing at the lest general election] they were talking about would lead the country to economic ruin, but when the Tories want to borrow at this level now, it's fine."" Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent The new Prime Minister Liz Truss has outlined her plans to deal with soaring energy bills faced by households and businesses. At its heart is a move to limit the 80% rise in domestic bills that was earmarked for October. So how much will you pay? Will you have to pay it back? And will you still get cost of living payments? Here's what it means for you. Truss' first major decision would be to protect the profits of big businesses, Blackford continues. He's describing the funding for this plan as a ""Truss tax"", adding that the decision to not increase a windfall tax is the worst decision she could possibly make. There is a difference between fair and an excess, or windfall, profits for companies like Shell and BP. Blackford criticises energy generation firms for paying dividends and buying back their own shares with these profits, rather than investing in infrastructure. More now from Blackford, who says the current system isn't fit for purpose and needs urgent review. He says businesses are facing a fight for survival and the UK government needs to grasp the scale of the emergency. In reality, the one big question is how it would be paid for and who would pay for it, Blackford says. He adds the prime minister has made a political choice to ask families to fund it, rather than businesses. Heading back to the energy debate now, and SNP leader Ian Blackford - who has sent his best wishes to the Queen following the news - is warning about impact of high energy bills. Blackford says this cost crisis puts lives and livelihoods at risk, but that people were left waiting all summer Blackford adds the plan that we've finally heard today falls short of what is needed to address people's costs. He says freezing prices wasn't a choice, but the only political option and setting the cap at Â£2,500 isn't a freeze, but baking in high prices. Speaker of the House Lindsay Hoyle has just interrupted
the energy debate, to say he and the House are sending their best wishes to the Queen -
following an announcement that the monarch is under medical supervision at Balmoral Castle. You can read morein our breaking story. Simon JackBBC Business Editor Consumer support is as expected. A typical household will see their energy bill rise to Â£2,500 in October which will be fixed for two years. A Â£400 rebate takes it down to Â£2,100. Additional
payments of Â£650 for those on qualifying benefits will also stay in place. But
there is no suggestion those payments will be repeated so average households
will see an energy price rise of over 25%. Businesses
offered ""equivalent support"" for a six month period but it is not
clear what that means as they have not yet published the unit cost per unit of
gas and electricity that they are using to generate the domestic cap and cannot
yet confirm whether the same unit cost will be applied to business customers. Business will
need greater clarity on this if they are to be reassured. Conservative MP Theresa May says the energy efficiency of homes needs to be improved, as it would not only reduce demand for energy, but would also help to save the planet. We do need to consider rolling out significant home insulation programme, she adds. Former PM Theresa May congratulates PM Liz Truss on acting so swiftly on energy bills. She welcomes the fact that energy bills action has been coupled with action on energy security. ""The vicious invasion of Ukraine by Russia has indeed shown the necessity of us having our own energy security,"" she says. Ione WellsPolitical Correspondent, BBC News There is a real ideological divide between this new Conservative
leadership and Labourâs. Keir Starmer calls Liz Trussâ opposition to
windfall taxes on oil and gas firms âridiculousâ, but the Tory front bench has
definitively ruled out any more taxes. Starmer himself calls this the big
âdivide.â Itâs a contrast to Boris Johnsonâs cabinet â who did end up
introducing the current windfall tax. Britain needs a fresh start, not a government who protect the profits of energy companies and doubles down on fossil fuels, Starmer says as he ends his stint at the despatch box. The change we need is not the fourth Tory prime minister in six years, but a Labour government, he concludes. If all countries took the approach of squeezing every single
drop out of their fossil fuel reserves, that would be devastating for our
planet, Starmer says. Wind and solar are now nine times cheaper than gas. So we need a
clean energy plan, urgently accelerating the rollout of offshore wine, onshore
wind, solar, nuclear, hydrogen and tidal. Starmer says fracking and a dash for gas in the North Sea will not boost our supply in the short term or energy security. But he adds it will fight our ability to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and stick to net zero commitments. He then reads out (lengthy) quotes from Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng a few months ago, where he argued that fracking and North Sea oil would not reduce wholesale prices. Starmer says doubling down on fossil fuels is a ""ludicrous"" answer to an energy crisis, given the threat that climate change poses to the planet and future generations. Need a recap? Here are the main points of the new PM's plan on energy. Household
bills:  Business
bills:  Paying for the plan:  Energy
supply: We're thick into the debate in the Commons now. But many of you will be wondering: what happens now? Greg Jackson, chief executive and founder of Octopus Energy, says: ""Companies and government are now working through the details
and customers should sit tight and wait to hear from their energy supplier. ""Nothing will change until 1 October and we'll be in touch with everyone
before then."" Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent The prime minister said a fund will be created to support
those who are not covered by a cap. This includes people who use heating oil in their homes,
those who have communal heating schemes, and people in mobile home parks who
pay the park-owner rather than a supplier. More details will come later, but this will be an extremely
complex task. For example, people in park homes do not yet know how they
will receive the Â£400 discount available to everyone â and that was announced
months ago. Expect debate over how people get this money, and how soon. The Labour leader says he is pleased that the principle of a price limit has been accepted. But this support, ""does not come cheap"", he adds. The real question before the house today the government faces, the political question, is who is going to pay? The Treasury estimates that energy companies could make Â£170bn in unexpected windfall profits over the next two years. The head of BP has called this crisis a cash machine for his company, and households are on the other end of that cash machine, their bills are funding these eye-watering profits, says Starmer. ""That's why we've been calling for a windfall tax since January, and it's why we want to see it expanded. ""The consequence is the bill will be picked up by working people."" Repeating arguments he made at Prime Minister's Questions yesterday, the Labour leader says Liz Truss is opposed to windfall taxes and wants to leave vast profits of energy companies on the table. He adds the bill will leave working people footing the bill. Starmer says there is no reason taxing these profits that have come about via market price spikes rather than planning would deter investment. He says her argument against it falls apart at first inspection, adding she is driven by dogma. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The government plans to move nuclear and renewable electricity generators to lower price contracts to cut bills, Prime Minister Liz Truss has said. ""Renewable and nuclear generators will move on to contracts for difference, to end the situation where electricity prices are set by the marginal price of gas,"" Truss told Parliament. The price paid to these companies is often set by the most costly generator. That is currently hugely expensive gas. Moving nuclear and renewable generators onto lower-priced contracts ""will mean that generators are receiving a fair price reflecting their cost of production, further bringing down the cost of this intervention,"" Truss said. The government will ask renewable and nuclear generators to take up new 10 or 15-year contracts at fixed prices well below the current rates, sources familiar with the discussions say. Liz Truss says she won't introduce a windfall tax on energy companies, but she will need to address the issue of their huge profits. The energy market consultancy Cornwall Insight estimates energy prices are likely to be more than Â£40bn higher because of the fact that some electricity generators are being paid based on the hugely inflated gas price. That is a particularly pressing issue when the government is planning to spend tens of billions of pounds of taxpayers' money subsidising the nation's energy bills. Paying renewable energy companies less than the market price for gas would mean a very significant reduction in revenues for them, at least in the medium term. Yet RenewableUK, the industry body which represents most of the wind power companies in this group, has accepted this approach in principle. ""We're keen to work collaboratively with the government"" on the issue, RenewableUK's CEO Dan McGrail said. ""It makes no sense to allow the exorbitantly expensive cost of gas to set the price for the whole of the electricity market"", he said. How much are energy bills rising under the new plan? What is the windfall tax on oil and gas companies? What is fracking? RenewableUK represents most of the biggest renewable businesses in the UK including Orsted, Scottish Power, SSE, RWE and EDF. It confirms its members have had a ""series of discussions"" with the government on the issue and says it is waiting for the government to ""take a position"". So, why might they accept this huge potential hit to profits? RenewableUK says it is because the companies recognise it isn't fair for consumers to face such high prices at a time of national crisis. Those close to the discussions say they are probably also being offered a generous long-term price to reflect the short-term loss of profits. Shadow climate change secretary Ed Miliband told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Thursday that such long-term fixed-price contracts would have the effect of ensuring huge profits for electricity companies for years to come. ""This is a proposal from (energy industry trade association) Energy UK, and let's be clear about this proposal: This would lock in massive windfall profits for these electricity generators. ""Let me explain why: what Energy UK have said is we'll accept slightly lower prices now, so we can have much higher prices over the following 15 years. ""This would be a terrible deal for the British people, a terrible deal for billpayers. ""It is much better - if there are these unexpected windfalls, and there are - the right thing to do, the fair thing to do, is not to do some dodgy deal with these companies, but to do a windfall tax. Liz Truss may be ideologically opposed to windfall taxes but paying private companies billions of pounds in excess profits from the public purse is also a political liability.

"Face tattoos, or moko, have been a part of Maori culture for generations Social media platform Snapchat has removed a feature which allowed users to apply traditional Maori tattoos on their faces. The filters were pulled after their discovery prompted an outcry in New Zealand's indigenous Maori community. Maori people consider tattoo art as sacred, and it is taken as an important marker of the wearer's identity. The move follows local media reports that the filters were proliferating on social media. Radio New Zealand,externalshowed images of users applying filters with names like ""Maori Face Tattoo"" and ""Maori"" on popular platform Instagram. A statement from Snap, which owns the Snapchat platform, confirmed that the filter and a duplicate had been removed from their platform. Snapchat filters - which the company refers to as Lenses - uses Snap-owned software Looksery that allows users to modify their features in real time. Lenses are user-generated and can be freely shared and used by others on the platform. ""We encourage our community to create Lenses that are inclusive and any shared on Snapchat must comply with our community guidelines,"" Snap told the BBC in the statement. ""These are clear that we prohibit content that demeans, defames, or promotes discrimination."" Meta, which owns Instagram, had not responded by the time of publication. Facial tattoos, or moko, have been a part of Maori culture for centuries. They are carved into the skin using chisels in an important ritual, and are used as a means to mark each wearer's unique genealogy and heritage. Facial patterns are also gendered, with men's tattoos extending from forehead to throat, while women's tattoos usually extend from the lips to the chin. As a result, no two tattoos are identical and the mass application of the same filter across many different social media users' faces contributed to the outcry. Book pulled after NZ author criticises Maori tattoo Maori tribe tells anti-vaxxers to stop using haka There has been a resurgence in interest in moko among both Maori men and women. Since the 2000s, moko has become increasingly seen and accepted as part of mainstream New Zealand thanks to a new generation of tattoo practitioners, according to theMuseum of New Zealand,external.

"Lloyd Austin told allies their support for Ukraine should be long-lasting The US has approved nearly $2.7bn (Â£2.3bn) in new aid for Ukraine and allies, including $675m in weapons for Ukraine as it battles Russia. Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin announced the arms package at a meeting with dozens of fellow ministers at the US air base in Ramstein, Germany. The aid includes howitzers, munitions, Humvee vehicles, armoured ambulances and anti-tank systems. The US has already pledged about $13bn in military aid for Ukraine. The Biden administration said on Thursday it had earmarked $2bn in long-term assistance in the form of investments to bolster the security of Ukraine and 18 of its neighbours, including both Nato members and non-members at risk of future Russian aggression. It said it would notify Congress of the aid plan. US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken arrived in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, as his colleague urged Ukraine's allies to commit to supporting the country for as long as necessary and be prepared to adapt the type of support offered. In Kyiv, Mr Blinken said that the aid would be delivered at a ""pivotal"" moment during the war, with Ukrainian operations against Russian forces ""proving effective"". He also vowed that the US and its allies would ""continue to exert that pressure until the aggression ceases and Ukraine is fully sovereign and independent"". President Joe Biden wants to end America's ""forever wars"", but he is pumping billions of dollars into one that could grind on for a long time. After six months, Russia's invasion of Ukraine is entering a challenging new phase. Europe is facing a hard winter of high prices and fuel shortages because of the fallout from sanctions against Moscow and President Vladimir Putin's suspension of Russian gas supplies. Meanwhile, Ukraine has launched a counteroffensive in the south of the country to try to break a stalemate on the battlefield and convince struggling allies it's worth staying the course. Secretary of State Antony Blinken's visit to Kyiv was designed to underline that message by emphasising the Americans are committed to seeing this through. For Washington, of course, the stakes are bigger than Ukraine. The Biden administration - and a bipartisan majority in Congress - believes the Russian invasion threatens to rip up the rules of the liberal global order largely established by the US after World War Two. Despite that, President Biden's long game is not directed at a fast and decisive Ukrainian victory. His arms shipments have been calibrated by the fear that tensions could escalate into direct conflict with Russia. Some analysts and lawmakers have described the goal as preventing defeat rather than powering a win, and demanded the president be more aggressive. Others have said a win isn't possible and urged him to press for a ceasefire and a negotiated settlement. The administration argues that Russia isn't serious about finding a diplomatic solution and Ukraine doesn't have the leverage to press for one. Read more on this from Barbara In Washington, US President Joe Biden held a call with a number of US allies - including UK Prime Minister Liz Truss and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz - in which they reiterated their collective support for Ukraine.

While in Kyiv, Mr Blinken received a briefing from Ukrainian officials on the counter-offensive. He did not give details but both Ukrainian and pro-Russian officials report fighting around Balakleya, 60km (38 miles) south-east of Kharkiv.

"This video can not be played WATCH: Liz Truss announces energy price guarantee for next two years New Prime Minister Liz Truss will limit energy bill rises for all households for two years as the new prime minister tries to prevent widespread hardship. A typical household energy bill will be capped at Â£2,500 annually until 2024. The huge support scheme could cost up to Â£150bn, but Ms Truss refused to put a figure on it, saying ""extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures"". Businesses will get help, with prices capped for six months, a shorter period of protection than many had hoped for. The help will be for everyone in England, Scotland and Wales with equivalent assistance for Northern Ireland. But there are concerns the measures are not targeted enough, with no additional support for the most vulnerable. As a result, millions are still expected to be in fuel poverty this winter. The energy price cap - the highest amount suppliers are allowed to charge households for every unit of energy they use - had been due to rise to Â£3,549 for a typical household from October. To limit the amount customers' bills go up by, the unit price will be capped, although household energy bills will vary according to how much gas and electricity they use. The government will compensate energy firms for the difference between the wholesale price for gas and electricity they pay and the amount they can charge customers. 'Government help on energy bills is no use to me' What the new energy plan means for you How much are energy bills rising under the new plan? Where does the government borrow billions from? Commenting on what steps households should now take, Greg Jackson, chief executive and founder of Octopus Energy, said firms were still working through the details and customers should ""sit tight and wait to hear from their energy supplier"". ""Nothing will change until 1 October and we'll be in touch with everyone before then."" The dramatic state intervention will be funded by government borrowing, adding to the UK's already large debt pile. The total cost of the support will depend on the cost of energy on the international energy markets, which can be extremely volatile. This comes after Ms Truss rejected calls to extend a windfall tax on gas and oil company profits to pay for the package. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the refusal to fund it with a windfall tax showed she was ""driven by dogma"" and ""it's working people who will pay for that"". Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey accused the government of bringing in a ""phony freeze"" while ""refusing to properly tax the eye-watering profits of oil and gas companies."" ""This will still leave struggling families and pensioners facing impossible choices this winter as energy bills almost double,"" he said. Ms Truss argued it was ""the moment to be bold"". ""We are facing a global energy crisis, and there are no cost-free options,"" she said. Gas prices have soared this year, largely due to the conflict in Ukraine which has reduced supplies of Russian gas. Experts and charities warned that without help with soaring energy bills, lives would have been at risk this winter, with people struggling to afford basic day-to-day living costs. Citizens Advice chief executive Dame Clare Moriarty, told the BBC the package will provide ""much-needed relief for millions"" but said she was concerned it is not going to reverse the trends it was seeing. ""We're seeing problems turn up in the summer, which we would normally expect to be winter."" Ms Truss also outlined plans ""to make sure we have security of [energy] supply for the long-term"". This includes issuing new oil and gas exploration licences for the North Sea and lifting the ban on fracking for shale gas ""where there is local support for it"". In addition the government will: Scrap green levies - which add Â£150 to bills each year - which the Â£2,500 cap accounts for Continue with a previously announced Â£400 energy bills discount for all households. Taken together, the government said this ""will bring costs close to where the energy price cap stands today"". Launch a new oil and gas licensing round as early as next week, boosting production in the North Sea Seek to negotiate lower-priced long-term contracts with renewable and nuclear power companies Launch a joint scheme with the Bank of England to provide emergency support to struggling UK energy firms Launch a review to ensure the UK is meeting its Net Zero 2050 target in ""an economically-efficient way"", given the altered economic landscape. The decision to lift the ban on fracking will be controversial.The practice was halted in 2019- as outlined in the Tory Party 2019 manifesto - amid opposition from environmentalists and local concerns over earth tremors. The scheme to limit energy costs for businesses will also cover public sector groups like schools and charities. It will be in place for six months though it will be reviewed in three month's time ""to consider where this should be targeted to make sure those most in need get support"". The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) welcomed the help but said the announcement was ""sparse on detail"". ""Small businesses' instant reaction is that this is not enough information, yet, for them to plan,"" said Martin McTague, chairman of the FSB. Downing Street said the price cap would boost economic growth and curb inflation by as much as 5%. The rate at which prices rise is currently at a 40-year high of 10.1%, largely driven by soaring energy prices. The energy plan is a huge emergency intervention in keeping with the pandemic rescue package. It will lessen the anticipated pain in households and businesses, but not eliminate it. The recession the economy is heading for should be shallower. But these are the headlines of what the plan promises. It is unprecedented for an announcement of this size, to have so few details on the mechanisms involved, and no details on the costs. There is much up for grabs. Some allowance could be given for the fact the administration is only two days old. But it is clear from our reporting up and down the country that more businesses that have closed could have been saved if this package had come more quickly. And the uncertainty for business will not be settled until the actual unit price of energy is announced. The size of the intervention, which looks well in excess of Â£100bn, looks likely to raise questions about whether the PM can deliver her complete programme of promised immediate tax cuts. Much will depend on negotiations with renewables producers and a plan to buy gas on long-term contracts. There is a long queue of nations currently doing the same. Expect to see the new PM in Oslo, Ottawa and the Gulf before long. The plans for long-term production reflect a strategic decision not to be dependent on imported energy, that will take some time to come to fruition. The idea, however, is to address the root cause of a problem years in the making.

"The new PM Liz Truss has pledged to ""deliver on the energy crisis"" New Prime Minister Liz Truss will unveil plans to limit energy bill rises on Thursday, spending billions to protect people from soaring prices. Typical household energy bills could be capped at around Â£2,500 a year, with firms also likely to get some relief. It is unclear how long the support will last, but the government is expected to borrow at least Â£100bn to pay for it. Currently, a typical household's annual gas and electricity bill is due to rise from Â£1,971 to Â£3,549 in October. Experts and charities have warned that without help with soaring energy bills, lives will be at risk this winter, as people struggle to afford basic day-to-day living costs. However, the End Fuel Poverty Coalition pressure group estimates that if the energy price cap is frozen at Â£2,500, 6.9 million UK households will still be in fuel poverty this winter - up from 4.6 million last winter. The recent increase in consumers' bills follows sharp rises in wholesale gas prices largely due to the conflict in Ukraine, which has reduced supplies of Russian gas. Ahead of the announcement, Ms Truss said she knew families and firms were worried about ""how they are going to make ends meet this autumn and winter"". ""Putin's war in Ukraine and weaponisation of gas supply in Europe is causing global prices to rise - and this has only made clearer that we must boost our long-term energy security and supply,"" she said. She pledged to ""tackle the root cause of these problems, so that we are not in this position again"". To limit the amount customers' bills go up by, the government is expected to compensate energy firms for the difference between the wholesale price for gas and electricity they pay and the amount they can charge customers.

The final sum will depend on the cost of energy on the international energy markets - which can be extremely volatile - as well as whether additional support is offered to the most vulnerable households. But Labour said the government should extend a windfall tax on gas and oil company profits to pay for the package - with leader Sir Keir Starmerwarning that working people will be footing the billfor ""vast"" energy firm profits under her plans. Ed Miliband, the shadow secretary for climate change, told the BBC on Thursday: ""We know that the energy companies are making excess profits of Â£170bn over the next two years ""I cannot understand - apart from ideology and dogma - why the first port of call should not be [taxing] these excess profits."" The government is, however, planning a shake-up of the energy market, the BBC has learned. Following a series of meetings with officials, energy companies - mainly in the nuclear and renewables sector - have agreed in principle to accept new long-term contracts at fixed prices well below current rates, BBC climate editor Justin Rowlatt said. Most accept that the profits they are making currently are not sustainable during a national crisis, he added. However, Mr Miliband said accepting ""slightly lower prices now"" would mean ""much higher prices"" in future and be a ""terrible deal for billpayers"". Rocketing prices are leaving households facing eyewatering energy bills. Several councils are considering setting up ""warm banks"" - community spaces for people who cannot afford winter heating - while some teachers are warning of cuts to staff, school trips or courses to cover rising costs. Every household in the UKis already due to be given a one-off Â£400 discounton their fuel bills from October - a move announced by Ms Truss's defeated leadership rival Rishi Sunak while he was chancellor. And Â£650 will be paid to more than eight million low-income households who receive benefits or tax credits, alongsidefurther paymentsto pensioner households and disabled people. The current price cap - set by Ofgem and which limits the maximum amount domestic customers can be charged for each unit of energy - is due to increase in October. It will mean a typical household will pay Â£3,549 a year for their energy. Unlike households, businesses are not protected by an energy price cap. Many are currently facing even sharper rises in energy bills than households,which could lead to firms going underor cutting their wage bills by firing staff. But firms are also expected to receive some relief under the new plan. How high will energy bills go now? Pound falls to lowest level against dollar since 1985 What can I do if I can't pay my energy bill? Inflation may be 'significantly lower' under bills plan The system to support business could be more complex than that for households and is likely to be reviewed more often. According to reports, it could see the government force energy firms to offer specific reductions on the unit price of the energy used by firms. Business groups have welcomed the plan, although the British Chambers of Commerce warned ""it remains to be seen"" whether it goes far enough in providing the support that firms need. Abdul Shahid, who runs the Masala restaurant in Derby city centre, said his business needed help ""now, not three months later"". ""Our energy bills have more than doubled in many cases and all of our ingredients have gone up as well,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. ""We are definitely thinking about shutting our doors, it's very stressful."" Rosemary Brown, director of Bluebell Dairy, a luxury ice cream maker, said her energy costs had jumped from Â£35,000 a year to Â£80,000. That would rise to Â£225,000 a year if she renewed tomorrow, she added. ""We need help with capping the energy costs for the immediate future. We also strongly need to see some investment from the government in renewable energy so that 12 months along the line we've got systems in place."" If businesses are included, that could see the overall cost of the government support package rise to well above Â£100bn. The cost of UK government borrowing is currently at its highest level for eight years, with the yield on 10-year bonds rising above 3%. The rise in yield indicates investors' anticipation that the government will have to borrow more in future. It also means any future borrowing will be more expensive. However, some economists have suggested that plans to cap energy bills could mean that increases in the cost of living will peak earlier and be ""significantly lower"" than previously forecast. The cost of living is currently rising at its fastest rate in 40 years, with prices 10.1% higher than the same time last year. The rise is largely driven by the sharp rise in energy prices. Investment bank Goldman Sachs said that a cap on household energy bills could see inflation peak at 10.8% in October, rather than the 14.8% forecast before. It also sees prices falling more quickly as well, with inflation slowing to 2.4% by December 2023. The Bank of England also said the plan could slow rising prices. However, both cautioned that there was uncertainty around what exactly the plan will look like and what would happen once any cap is lifted. Economists also expect the UK to fall into a recession despite Ms Truss' energy support plan - albeit a shorter and less severe one. The Bank of England predicted the UK will enter a recession later this year - with the Bank's governor Andrew Bailey sayingthere is little that can be done to stop that happening. Meanwhile, Ms Truss is also reportedly set to announce she is scrapping the ban on fracking which was introduced in 2019 over concerns it was causing earth tremors. The controversial gas extraction technique involves drilling into the earth and directing a high-pressure solution at a rock layer to release the gas inside.

It fixes the maximum price that can be charged for each unit of energy on a standard - or default - tariff for a typical dual-fuel household which pays by direct debit.

The type of property you live in, how energy efficient it is, how many people live there and the weather all make a difference. The Ofgem cap is based on a ""typical household"" using 11,500 kWh of gas and 2,700 kWh of electricity a year with a single bill for gas and electricity, settled by direct debit. The vast majority of people pay their bill this way to help spread payments across the year. Those who pay every three months by cash or cheque are charged more.

"Lloyd Austin told allies their support for Ukraine should be long-lasting The US has approved nearly $2.7bn (Â£2.3bn) in new aid for Ukraine and allies, including $675m in weapons for Ukraine as it battles Russia. Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin announced the arms package at a meeting with dozens of fellow ministers at the US air base in Ramstein, Germany. The aid includes howitzers, munitions, Humvee vehicles, armoured ambulances and anti-tank systems. The US has already pledged about $13bn in military aid for Ukraine. The Biden administration said on Thursday it had earmarked $2bn in long-term assistance in the form of investments to bolster the security of Ukraine and 18 of its neighbours, including both Nato members and non-members at risk of future Russian aggression. It said it would notify Congress of the aid plan. US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken arrived in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, as his colleague urged Ukraine's allies to commit to supporting the country for as long as necessary and be prepared to adapt the type of support offered. In Kyiv, Mr Blinken said that the aid would be delivered at a ""pivotal"" moment during the war, with Ukrainian operations against Russian forces ""proving effective"". He also vowed that the US and its allies would ""continue to exert that pressure until the aggression ceases and Ukraine is fully sovereign and independent"". President Joe Biden wants to end America's ""forever wars"", but he is pumping billions of dollars into one that could grind on for a long time. After six months, Russia's invasion of Ukraine is entering a challenging new phase. Europe is facing a hard winter of high prices and fuel shortages because of the fallout from sanctions against Moscow and President Vladimir Putin's suspension of Russian gas supplies. Meanwhile, Ukraine has launched a counteroffensive in the south of the country to try to break a stalemate on the battlefield and convince struggling allies it's worth staying the course. Secretary of State Antony Blinken's visit to Kyiv was designed to underline that message by emphasising the Americans are committed to seeing this through. For Washington, of course, the stakes are bigger than Ukraine. The Biden administration - and a bipartisan majority in Congress - believes the Russian invasion threatens to rip up the rules of the liberal global order largely established by the US after World War Two. Despite that, President Biden's long game is not directed at a fast and decisive Ukrainian victory. His arms shipments have been calibrated by the fear that tensions could escalate into direct conflict with Russia. Some analysts and lawmakers have described the goal as preventing defeat rather than powering a win, and demanded the president be more aggressive. Others have said a win isn't possible and urged him to press for a ceasefire and a negotiated settlement. The administration argues that Russia isn't serious about finding a diplomatic solution and Ukraine doesn't have the leverage to press for one. Read more on this from Barbara In Washington, US President Joe Biden held a call with a number of US allies - including UK Prime Minister Liz Truss and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz - in which they reiterated their collective support for Ukraine.

"The government plans to move nuclear and renewable electricity generators to lower price contracts to cut bills, Prime Minister Liz Truss has said. ""Renewable and nuclear generators will move on to contracts for difference, to end the situation where electricity prices are set by the marginal price of gas,"" Truss told Parliament. The price paid to these companies is often set by the most costly generator. That is currently hugely expensive gas. Moving nuclear and renewable generators onto lower-priced contracts ""will mean that generators are receiving a fair price reflecting their cost of production, further bringing down the cost of this intervention,"" Truss said. The government will ask renewable and nuclear generators to take up new 10 or 15-year contracts at fixed prices well below the current rates, sources familiar with the discussions say. Liz Truss says she won't introduce a windfall tax on energy companies, but she will need to address the issue of their huge profits. The energy market consultancy Cornwall Insight estimates energy prices are likely to be more than Â£40bn higher because of the fact that some electricity generators are being paid based on the hugely inflated gas price. That is a particularly pressing issue when the government is planning to spend tens of billions of pounds of taxpayers' money subsidising the nation's energy bills. Paying renewable energy companies less than the market price for gas would mean a very significant reduction in revenues for them, at least in the medium term. Yet RenewableUK, the industry body which represents most of the wind power companies in this group, has accepted this approach in principle. ""We're keen to work collaboratively with the government"" on the issue, RenewableUK's CEO Dan McGrail said. ""It makes no sense to allow the exorbitantly expensive cost of gas to set the price for the whole of the electricity market"", he said. How much are energy bills rising under the new plan? What is the windfall tax on oil and gas companies? What is fracking? RenewableUK represents most of the biggest renewable businesses in the UK including Orsted, Scottish Power, SSE, RWE and EDF. It confirms its members have had a ""series of discussions"" with the government on the issue and says it is waiting for the government to ""take a position"". So, why might they accept this huge potential hit to profits? RenewableUK says it is because the companies recognise it isn't fair for consumers to face such high prices at a time of national crisis. Those close to the discussions say they are probably also being offered a generous long-term price to reflect the short-term loss of profits. Shadow climate change secretary Ed Miliband told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Thursday that such long-term fixed-price contracts would have the effect of ensuring huge profits for electricity companies for years to come. ""This is a proposal from (energy industry trade association) Energy UK, and let's be clear about this proposal: This would lock in massive windfall profits for these electricity generators. ""Let me explain why: what Energy UK have said is we'll accept slightly lower prices now, so we can have much higher prices over the following 15 years. ""This would be a terrible deal for the British people, a terrible deal for billpayers. ""It is much better - if there are these unexpected windfalls, and there are - the right thing to do, the fair thing to do, is not to do some dodgy deal with these companies, but to do a windfall tax. Liz Truss may be ideologically opposed to windfall taxes but paying private companies billions of pounds in excess profits from the public purse is also a political liability. The companies know that if a solution isn't found she might deicide she has to hold her nose and impose such a tax, and that if she does, she might go after the billions of profits the companies have already made.

"The pound has plummeted to its lowest level against the US dollar since 1985. Sterling fell 0.64% to $1.145 on Wednesday afternoon - a level not seen in 37 years. The Bank of England said a weaker outlook for the UK economy as well as a stronger dollar were putting pressure on sterling. Governor Andrew Bailey also warned that little could be done to stop the UK falling into a recession this year as the war in Ukraine continued. He added that it would ""overwhelmingly be caused by the actions of Russia and the impact on energy prices"". The Bank expects the economy to shrink in the last three months of 2022 and keep shrinking until the end of 2023. The warning comes ahead of a government plan to limit a sharp rise in energy bills. It is understood that a typical energy bill could be capped at around Â£2,500,with new Prime Minister Liz Truss set to announce the details on Thursday. Currently, a typical household's gas and electricity bill is due to rise from Â£1,971 to Â£3,549 in October. UK will fall into recession this year, warns Bank How high will energy bills go now? Energy prices climbed sharply when lockdown was lifted and the economy started to return to normal. They have increased further as Russia sharply cut its gas supplies to Europe. It has pushed up the price of gas across the continent, including in the UK, having a huge knock-on effect on consumers. Speaking in front of the Treasury Select Committee on Wednesday, Mr Bailey said ""sadly"" a recession remained the most likely outcome in the UK. When asked by MPs if there was much that the central bank could do to stop it, he said: ""Insofar as the war is having this huge effect, the answer to that would be no."" Governor Andrew Bailey said a recession would ""overwhelmingly be caused by the actions of Russia and the impact on energy prices"". The Bank predicted a UK recession last month as it raised interest rates by the highest margin in 27 years in a bid to keep soaring prices under control. Higher interest rates can make borrowing more expensive, meaning people have less money to spend and prices will stop rising as quickly. But there is a limit as to how effective UK rate rises can be when inflation is caused by global issues. Defending its recent moves, Mr Bailey added: ""The person going to put the UK in recession is Vladimir Putin, not the MPC [Monetary Policy Committee]."" He said the Bank would take the new prime minister's energy plan announcement ""into account"" when deciding on interest rates next week. During her campaign, Ms Truss hit out at the Bank of England, accusing it of being slow to react to rising prices and protect vulnerable households. But on Wednesday, the new Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng reiterated his ""full support for the independent Bank of England and their mission to control inflation, which is central to tackling cost of living challenges"". He also said he and Mr Bailey would meet twice a week from now on to discuss the cost-of-living crisis. Other economists also expect the UK to fall into a recession despite Ms Truss's energy support plan - albeit a shorter and less severe one. But some suggested on Wednesday that plans to cap energy bills could mean that increases in the cost of living will peak earlier and be ""significantly lower"" than previously forecast. The cost of living is rising at its fastest rate in 40 years, at 10.1%, with food, fuel and energy prices all up. Investment bank Goldman Sachs said a cap on bills for households could see inflation, which tracks how the cost of living changes over time, peak at 10.8% in October, rather than the 14.8% it forecast before. It then expects inflation to slow to 2.4% by December 2023. Deutsche Bank, HSBC and the Bank of England's own chief economist, Huw Pill, also believe the plan could slow price rises. But there is uncertainty around what exactly the plan will look like and what would happen once any cap is lifted. Mr Pill also said it was too soon to say how it might affect interest rates, which have gone up for the last six months in a row as the Bank tries to calm prices. Others say that capping energy prices at their current level would still leave many people struggling. According tothe Office for National Statistics,external, four in 10 adults who pay energy bills are already finding it ""very or somewhat difficult to afford them"". And the End Fuel Poverty Coalition pressure group estimates that if the energy price cap is frozen at Â£2,500 this October, 6.9 million UK households will still be in fuel poverty this winter - up from 4.6 million last winter.

The BBC's Colletta Smith tells you - in a minute - about four discounts and payments that could help There are also concerns about the cost of Ms Truss's plan, with research firm Capital Economics describing the support package as an ""effective but expensive sticking plaster"". Many expect the government to borrow at least Â£100bn, adding to the UK's already-high debt pile. This would come as Ms Truss attempts to push through a promised Â£30bn of tax cuts. On Wednesday, the chancellor said higher borrowing will be ""necessary"" in the short term to help people with bills. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, told the BBC's Today programme: ""The big question here is: 'Is it going to be Â£100bn? What is the exit strategy from supporting bills?' ""My guess is it might end up being an awful lot more than that unless we react quite quickly to make it a better [energy] system,"" he said, adding that the plan would benefit affluent people more than the less well off. On the other side of the House of Commons just before the PMQs battle, was perhaps the more important Commons appearance. Governor Andrew Bailey and his team, confirming that there was not much they can do to stop a recession, blaming it on the Kremlin, and acknowledging that the UK is facing an historically unprecedented energy shock. It is heading to be three or four times worse for households than the hit to incomes in the 1970s' oil shock. At the same time the Bank welcomed the end of the summer uncertainty over energy bills, and anticipate that it will be big enough to prevent inflation spiralling higher. However Governor Bailey also acknowledged there were specific UK factors driving jittery markets, in addition to the strong dollar, especially the UK's extra reliance on gas. As Chief Economist Huw Pill put it, that dependence is not going to change quickly, so the only real question is ""who covers that cost?"". With sterling falling again today, to a 37 year low against the dollar, there are concerns in the markets that the PM and Chancellor will hope to contain tomorrow.

"A malaria vaccine with ""world-changing"" potential has been developed by scientists at the University of Oxford. The team expect it to be rolled out next year after trials showed up to 80% protection against the deadly disease. Crucially, say the scientists, their vaccine is cheap and they already have a deal to manufacture more than 100 million doses a year. The charity Malaria No More said recent progress meant children dying from malaria could end ""in our lifetimes"". It has taken more than a century to develop effective vaccines as the malaria parasite, which is spread by mosquitoes, is spectacularly complex and elusive. It is a constantly moving target, shifting forms inside the body, which make it hard to immunise against. Last year, the World Health Organization gave thehistoric go-aheadfor the first vaccine - developed by pharmaceutical giant GSK - to be used in Africa. However, the Oxford team claim their approach is more effective and can be manufactured on a far greater scale. Trial results from 409 children in Nanoro, Burkina Faso, have beenpublished in the Lancet Infectious Diseases,external. It shows three initial doses followed by a booster a year later gives up to 80% protection. Trials took place in Burkina Faso ""We think these data are the best data yet in the field with any malaria vaccine,"" said Prof Adrian Hill, director of the Jenner Institute at the university. The team will start the process of getting their vaccine approved in the next few weeks, but a final decision will hinge on the results of a larger trial of 4,800 children due before the end of the year. The world's largest vaccine manufacturer - the Serum Institute of India - is already lined up to make more than 100 million doses a year. Prof Hill said the vaccine - called R21 - could be made for ""a few dollars"" and ""we really could be looking at a very substantial reduction in that horrendous burden of malaria"". He added: ""We hope that this will be deployed and available and saving lives, certainly by the end of next year."" Malaria has been one of the biggest scourges on humanity for millennia and mostly kills babies and infants. The disease still kills more than 400,000 people a year even after dramatic progress with bed nets, insecticides and drugs. This malaria vaccine is the 14th that Prof Katie Ewer has worked on at Oxford as ""this is not like Covid where we have seven vaccines straight away that will work... it's much, much harder"". She told the BBC it was ""incredibly gratifying"" to get this far and ""the potential achievement that this vaccine could have if it's rolled out could be really world-changing"". The currently approved vaccine - made by GSK - shares similarities with the one developed in Oxford. Both target the first stage of the parasite's lifecycle by intercepting it before it gets to the liver and establishes a foothold in the body. The vaccines are built using a combination of proteins from the malaria parasite and the hepatitis B virus, but Oxford's version has a higher proportion of malaria proteins. The team think this helps the immune system to focus on malaria rather than the hepatitis. The success of the GSK vaccine has partly paved the way for Oxford to be optimistic of having their vaccine out next year - such as by assessing how feasible a vaccination programme in Africa would be. It is hard to give a direct comparison of the two vaccines. GSK's has gone through large real world trials whereas Oxford's data may appear more effective due to being given just ahead of the peak malaria season in Burkina Faso. Prof Azra Ghani, chair in infectious disease epidemiology at Imperial College London, said the trial results were ""very welcome"", but warned it would take money to get vaccines in arms. ""Without this investment, we risk losing the gains that have been made over the last decades and witnessing a rising tide of malaria resurgence,"" Prof Ghani said. Gareth Jenkins, from the charity Malaria No More UK said: ""Today's R21 vaccine results from Oxford's renowned Jenner Institute are another encouraging signal that, with the right support, the world could end child deaths from malaria in our lifetimes.""

"The new PM Liz Truss has pledged to ""deliver on the energy crisis"" New Prime Minister Liz Truss will unveil plans to limit energy bill rises on Thursday, spending billions to protect people from soaring prices. Typical household energy bills could be capped at around Â£2,500 a year, with firms also likely to get some relief. It is unclear how long the support will last, but the government is expected to borrow at least Â£100bn to pay for it. Currently, a typical household's annual gas and electricity bill is due to rise from Â£1,971 to Â£3,549 in October. Experts and charities have warned that without help with soaring energy bills, lives will be at risk this winter, as people struggle to afford basic day-to-day living costs. However, the End Fuel Poverty Coalition pressure group estimates that if the energy price cap is frozen at Â£2,500, 6.9 million UK households will still be in fuel poverty this winter - up from 4.6 million last winter. The recent increase in consumers' bills follows sharp rises in wholesale gas prices largely due to the conflict in Ukraine, which has reduced supplies of Russian gas. Ahead of the announcement, Ms Truss said she knew families and firms were worried about ""how they are going to make ends meet this autumn and winter"". ""Putin's war in Ukraine and weaponisation of gas supply in Europe is causing global prices to rise - and this has only made clearer that we must boost our long-term energy security and supply,"" she said. She pledged to ""tackle the root cause of these problems, so that we are not in this position again"". To limit the amount customers' bills go up by, the government is expected to compensate energy firms for the difference between the wholesale price for gas and electricity they pay and the amount they can charge customers. How is the rising cost of living affecting you? Do you have any questions for our experts?Get in touch. Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external WhatsApp:+44 7756 165803,external Tweet:@BBC_HaveYourSay,external Please read ourterms & conditionsandprivacy policy Customers will not be expected to repay the help, with the huge support package due to be funded by the government borrowing about Â£100bn. The final sum will depend on the cost of energy on the international energy markets - which can be extremely volatile - as well as whether additional support is offered to the most vulnerable households. But Labour said the government should extend a windfall tax on gas and oil company profits to pay for the package - with leader Sir Keir Starmerwarning that working people will be footing the billfor ""vast"" energy firm profits under her plans. Ed Miliband, the shadow secretary for climate change, told the BBC on Thursday: ""We know that the energy companies are making excess profits of Â£170bn over the next two years ""I cannot understand - apart from ideology and dogma - why the first port of call should not be [taxing] these excess profits."" The government is, however, planning a shake-up of the energy market, the BBC has learned. Following a series of meetings with officials, energy companies - mainly in the nuclear and renewables sector - have agreed in principle to accept new long-term contracts at fixed prices well below current rates, BBC climate editor Justin Rowlatt said. Most accept that the profits they are making currently are not sustainable during a national crisis, he added. However, Mr Miliband said accepting ""slightly lower prices now"" would mean ""much higher prices"" in future and be a ""terrible deal for billpayers"". Rocketing prices are leaving households facing eyewatering energy bills. Several councils are considering setting up ""warm banks"" - community spaces for people who cannot afford winter heating - while some teachers are warning of cuts to staff, school trips or courses to cover rising costs. Every household in the UKis already due to be given a one-off Â£400 discounton their fuel bills from October - a move announced by Ms Truss's defeated leadership rival Rishi Sunak while he was chancellor. And Â£650 will be paid to more than eight million low-income households who receive benefits or tax credits, alongsidefurther paymentsto pensioner households and disabled people. The current price cap - set by Ofgem and which limits the maximum amount domestic customers can be charged for each unit of energy - is due to increase in October. It will mean a typical household will pay Â£3,549 a year for their energy. Unlike households, businesses are not protected by an energy price cap. Many are currently facing even sharper rises in energy bills than households,which could lead to firms going underor cutting their wage bills by firing staff. But firms are also expected to receive some relief under the new plan. How high will energy bills go now? Pound falls to lowest level against dollar since 1985 What can I do if I can't pay my energy bill? Inflation may be 'significantly lower' under bills plan The system to support business could be more complex than that for households and is likely to be reviewed more often. According to reports, it could see the government force energy firms to offer specific reductions on the unit price of the energy used by firms. Business groups have welcomed the plan, although the British Chambers of Commerce warned ""it remains to be seen"" whether it goes far enough in providing the support that firms need. Abdul Shahid, who runs the Masala restaurant in Derby city centre, said his business needed help ""now, not three months later"". ""Our energy bills have more than doubled in many cases and all of our ingredients have gone up as well,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. ""We are definitely thinking about shutting our doors, it's very stressful."" Rosemary Brown, director of Bluebell Dairy, a luxury ice cream maker, said her energy costs had jumped from Â£35,000 a year to Â£80,000. That would rise to Â£225,000 a year if she renewed tomorrow, she added. ""We need help with capping the energy costs for the immediate future. We also strongly need to see some investment from the government in renewable energy so that 12 months along the line we've got systems in place."" If businesses are included, that could see the overall cost of the government support package rise to well above Â£100bn. The cost of UK government borrowing is currently at its highest level for eight years, with the yield on 10-year bonds rising above 3%. The rise in yield indicates investors' anticipation that the government will have to borrow more in future. It also means any future borrowing will be more expensive. However, some economists have suggested that plans to cap energy bills could mean that increases in the cost of living will peak earlier and be ""significantly lower"" than previously forecast. The cost of living is currently rising at its fastest rate in 40 years, with prices 10.1% higher than the same time last year. The rise is largely driven by the sharp rise in energy prices. Investment bank Goldman Sachs said that a cap on household energy bills could see inflation peak at 10.8% in October, rather than the 14.8% forecast before. It also sees prices falling more quickly as well, with inflation slowing to 2.4% by December 2023. The Bank of England also said the plan could slow rising prices. However, both cautioned that there was uncertainty around what exactly the plan will look like and what would happen once any cap is lifted. Economists also expect the UK to fall into a recession despite Ms Truss' energy support plan - albeit a shorter and less severe one. The Bank of England predicted the UK will enter a recession later this year - with the Bank's governor Andrew Bailey sayingthere is little that can be done to stop that happening. Meanwhile, Ms Truss is also reportedly set to announce she is scrapping the ban on fracking which was introduced in 2019 over concerns it was causing earth tremors. The controversial gas extraction technique involves drilling into the earth and directing a high-pressure solution at a rock layer to release the gas inside.

"Chris Heaton-Harris is the MP for Daventry Sinn FÃ©in vice-president Michelle O'Neill said she told the new secretary of state that the absence of an executive in Northern Ireland was no longer tolerable. Ms O'Neill said the government needed to stop ""pandering"" to the DUP. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said Sinn FÃ©in ""need to grow up"". After meeting Chris Heaton-Harris, Ms O'Neill accused the government of being ""in hock"" to the right-wing European Research Group (ERG). The new secretary of state also met DUP leaders on Thursday. However, he did not meet representatives of Alliance, the Ulster Unionist Party or the SDLP. Mr Heaton-Harris said he looked forward to meeting ""all political parties"" in the coming days. Speaking after meeting him in Dungannon, Ms O'Neill said: ""There must be a deal. We must find a way forward. ""We have a new prime minister and a new secretary of state but it's still the Tory party; different people at the helm but it's still the Tory party. ""My focus and I suppose my message to the new secretary of state this morning was very clear: 'It's get down to business; work with others, find an agreed way forward. ""'Bring that certainty and stability that is required. Get an executive up and running and stop pandering to the DUP."" Mr Heaton-Harris and the new minister of state at the Northern Ireland office, Steve Baker, are past chairmen of the pro-Brexit group ERG within the parliamentary Conservative Party. ""The ERG have been dictating the pace and bringing a very toxic influence to our local politics,"" Ms O'Neill said. Michelle O'Neill said she welcomed the secretary of state's ""warm words"" about the restoration of the executive being his priority, but added that that had not been the case with the Conservative party to date ""So, regardless of who's there, that's a feature. My concern is that I stand up for people here and the people want an executive up and running. ""They want us to put money into their pockets to help them get us through this nightmare of a cost-of-living crisis."" Sir Jeffrey said Mr Heaton-Harris and Mr Baker ""understand the difficulties we face at this time and the challenges we need to overcome"". ""I'm sure the secretary of state will share our view that decisive action needs to be taken to address those problems so that the political institutions can be restored here,"" the DUP leader said. He said his party was committed to helping the people of Northern Ireland, unlike Sinn FÃ©in who he said ""need to grow up."" He said there was a prospect of renewed negotiations but a ""change of stance by the European Union"" was required. ""When they talk about respecting the Belfast Agreement, that means, in article 1 of that agreement, respecting Northern Ireland's place in the United Kingdom - because that's what the people of Northern Ireland support."" Mr Heaton-Harris was in Dungannon for his first official visit to Northern Ireland.Heaton-Harris makes first visit as NI Secretary He was announced aspart of new Prime Minister Liz Truss's cabinet,following the sacking of Shailesh Vara. He was criticised for only holding meetings with Sinn FÃ©in and the DUP on the first day of his visit. However, UUP leader Doug Beattie will meet Mr Heaton-Harris on Tuesday. He said next week's meeting gave him time ""to go to him with our concerns and our proposals to get the executive up and running again"". Mr Heaton-Harris said he wanted to ""deliver enough pressure"" to get an executive restored and resolve the dispute over the Northern Ireland Protocol. In a statement, he said, ""It has been brilliant to be out and about in Northern Ireland today, and to talk to people about how we can deliver for the people of Northern Ireland."" Mr Heaton-Harris explained that the UK government was currently faced with a ""range of challenging issues"" including finding a solution to the Northern Ireland Protocol and the rising cost of living. Following the announcement by the prime minister of a energy support package he said he had been speaking to his Cabinet colleagues to ensure that support would be delivered in Northern Ireland ""as soon as possible."" At his first NI Questions on Wednesday Mr Heaton-Harris said the best way forward was to have a functioning executive. Ms Truss told the Commons the Northern Ireland Executive must return - and at the end of next month the new secretary of state will have to decide what to do if this does not happen. New secretary of state Chris Heaton-Harris speaks to the press in Dungannon If Stormont has not returned by 28 October, a 12-week period will be triggered during which he will have to call a fresh assembly election, unless the government instead chooses to push back the deadline. On Wednesday, Mr Heaton-Harris said he would ""work with everybody"" to resolve problems over the Northern Ireland Protocol. Brexit: What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? How does Northern Ireland's power-sharing government work? Read More: Who is Northern Ireland's new secretary of state? He also told the Commons that he wanted to negotiate a solution with the EU but that the UK government would legislate at Westminster if this did not happen. He called on the DUP to return to power sharing as soon as possible. But he is seen by some as an ally of the party because of his support for Brexit and his desire to change the protocol. Sinn FÃ©in's Conor Murphy, who met Mr Heaton-Harris alongside Ms O'Neill, earlier said he would encourage him to meet all Northern Ireland parties. He said: ""We will deal with any British secretary the way we've dealt with previous ones. British government policy in Ireland is the problem and particularly in relation to the protocol and other issues affecting Brexit. ""We need to see them back in proper negotiations with the EU so the benefits of the protocol can be felt here and we stop suffering the full effect of Brexit as is happening right across Britain at this moment."" DUP MP Sammy Wilson said the outcome of what Ms Truss's government does about the protocol was ""the most important thing"". ""Until that is dealt with, people will find that their cost of living goes up even more than the rest of the UK, due to additional costs which the protocol is imposing on goods coming into Northern Ireland,"" he said. ""The cost of living issues are not going to be dealt with by Stormont - Stormont doesn't have the money. ""It is going to come from Westminster so we'll be looking out for what's announced today in terms of energy help for people and then of course later on when the government brings its budget."" Meanwhile, SDLP MP Claire Hanna has described the appointments of Mr Heaton-Harris and Mr Baker as ""concerning"". ""It is fair to say Liz Truss has appointed two men known for being very much associated with having a very hardline Brexit view and they're former chairs of the ERG (European Research Group),"" she said. ""I would suggest it is that ERG ideology that has got Northern Ireland into the place we're in. Six years of not properly acknowledging, understanding and processing the realities of Brexit with the geography we have. ""We do think it is a concerning appointment - there are optimistic interpretations that she's sending a hardliner in to look tough and to do the deal but at the moment it doesn't send a good signal about her willingness to work with people who do not support a hardline Brexit and to work with the EU,"" she added.

"""Gasmageddon"" is bearing down on Europe this winter. It may sound like the stuff of nightmares. But this is no science fiction. The number of households facing energy poverty has doubled across the EU, according to financial services provider Allianz. Gas shortages could drive up retail prices by 200%. Three-quarters of companies in the bloc's economic powerhouse, Germany, say they're experiencing ""severe strain"" from spiralling energy prices. In the UK, energy bills have gone up 80%. The word ""recession"" is whispered everywhere. Vladimir Putin is not only using conventional military weapons in Ukraine, he is also weaponising energy to try to intimidate the West, as he seeks to readjust the balance of power in Europe to Russia's favour. On Wednesday, he railed: ""We will not supply anything at all if it is contrary to our interests. No gas, no oil, no coal, no fuel oil, nothing."" Squeezing the EU had looked to the Kremlin like a piece of cake. The bloc relied on Russia for 40% of its gas and a third of its oil before Mr Putin invaded Ukraine. Big EU powers Germany and Italy were even more dependent. The Russian president has been switching gas supplies on and off at whim for months and the colder months are fast approaching. Even countries traditionally less reliant on Russian energy, such as France, Spain and non-EU UK, are affected by the volatility and price hikes on the global energy markets. With businesses threatened with bankruptcy and vulnerable voters facing a choice of paying for food or fuel this winter, political and social tensions have soared alongside prices. Prague saw mass demonstrations last weekend, with angry crowds protesting against the cost of living crisis and demanding an end to sanctions against Russia. Bear in mind that the Czech Republic has, till now, always been hawkish towards Russia and outspoken about the need to defend Ukraine. But the economic pain at home is biting hard. As they did at the start of the Covid crisis, EU countries tried to find their own, national, solutions. Spain slapped limits on air conditioning in public buildings and Germany tried to discourage people from using their cars by reducing fares on public transport, while in Italy, a Nobel prize-winning physicist sparked a furious cultural debate, suggesting people could cook pasta with the heat off to save energy and cost. A number of member states have hastily assembled financial packages to help struggling households and/or businesses. Their aim: both to reduce energy consumption and to keep costs down for consumers. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has become fond of peppering his (German-language) news conference with the English words of the song You'll Never Walk Alone, popularised by Gerry and the Pacemakers. But the focus now is on finding a European solution. And not a few EU figures, French President Emmanuel Macron included, have said they'd love the UK to be part of a plan. More on that later. The drive for the common EU approach is manifold. In part, it comes from the same post-Covid crisis realisation that as part of a single market, when the economies of some member states suffer, it pulls everyone down. There's also an appreciation that there's strength in numbers. Countries such as Italy and Germany have been busy trying to find alternative energy suppliers - in Algeria and the UAE, for example. But if the EU as a whole, with its economic clout, makes the energy deal, the conditions are likely to be more favourable. ""We have to achieve that we only pay the world market price, rather than a higher price,"" said Mr Scholz on Wednesday. His Belgian counterpart, Alexander De Croo, pointed out that gas prices in Europe are currently double those in Asia and 10 times as much as in the US. EU purchasing power would also avoid one member state trying to outbid another in their scramble for energy. Not a good look when it comes to EU unity. There is, too, a very sincere desire in the EU to stop pouring energy money into Russia's war chest. It's true, the majority of member states have drastically reduced their reliance on Russia by now. But as one very irritated EU diplomat pointed out to me, sky-high energy prices mean EU countries still pay almost the same daily amount of money to Moscow, although they currently receive so much less. ""Putin has to be roaring with laughter at us,"" he said. EU energy ministers have been summoned to an emergency meeting in Brussels on Friday to discuss a raft of proposals to jointly combat the crisis. ""Russia is manipulating our energy markets,"" tweeted EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen, ""[but] we have the economic strength, the political will and unity to keep the upper hand."" EU countries have already reached agreements on reducing Russian oil imports and Russian gas reliance. The Commission established joint gas purchasing capabilities back in April and planned sufficient energy storage ahead of this winter. Proposals for this Friday include: Mandatory targets to reduce electricity use in peak times, as that drives up electricity prices Cap revenues of companies that make electricity using cheaper means than gas - such as nuclear or renewables. Use that windfall gain to help struggling consumers/businesses Cap revenues of oil and gas companies, making a huge profit out of high prices. Use that windfall gain to help struggling households and invest in renewable energy sources Help utility companies stay afloat despite market volatility Cap Russian gas prices But EU leaders are far from united in their priorities or energy planning. Unanimous or immediate agreement is unlikely on Friday. Germany is still iffy about capping Russian gas prices, for example. Poland wants all extra-EU gas sources to have a price cap. And there are other tricky issues such as if/when to decouple the gas and electricity markets (a similar debate rages in the UK) and how to ensure consumers understand the long-term need to change habits and consume less energy, even if governments intervene to keep prices lower. European Green parties are also extremely uneasy about the EU rush to replace Russian fossil fuel supplies with others elsewhere. The German Green Party is a senior government coalition partner. Its co-chair, Robert Habeck, is deputy prime minister and economics minister. He's been travelling cap in hand to the United Arab Emirates, keen as keen for fossil fuel deals - an irony not lost on his opponents. German Green MEP Ska Keller admitted to me that yes, Green politicians had big plans, ""but then governing happens."" She insisted that polls in Germany indicate voters understand that the Greens are being ""responsible and pragmatic"" in a time of energy crisis, but that they haven't forgotten the climate emergency. European Commission energy spokesman, Tim McPhie, is quick to underline when that it comes to energy, there are ""short-term fixes and longer term fixes"". The EU Green Deal and climate goals are a huge source of pride in Brussels. Mr McPhie says long-term European security is not about replacing Russian gas with gas from somewhere else - it's about renewables' energy efficiency. And what about that invitation for UK co-operation on energy that I mentioned earlier, repeated to me again this week by the French Europe Minister, Laurence Boone? Her predecessor, Nathalie Loiseau, says that in these times of crisis, co-operation makes more sense than post-Brexit ""splendid isolation"". But while it could make economic sense for the UK to join together with the EU to try to benefit from lower prices on the global market, new PM Liz Truss, even if tempted, might find that co-operation politically awkward with some parts of her Conservative party. Ukraine urges Europe not to wobble on war support No going back to reliance on Russian gas from here EU plans Russian gas price cap despite Putin threat There is, though, an aspect of energy and the EU that Prime Minister Truss won't be able to ignore. And that's to do with Northern Ireland. The island of Ireland has a single electricity market, interconnected to Great Britain, says Mary Starks, former director at GB energy regulator Ofgem, now energy specialist at Flint. But the Republic of Ireland is an EU member state, theoretically subject to EU common energy regulations. ""So what this means for both Northern Ireland and the Republic will come into focus at some point,"" says Ms Starks. And if wholesale energy prices are successfully reduced on one side of the Channel, but not the other? Ms Starks told me that normally, energy flows very freely across electricity and gas interconnectors, but if the EU, for example, managed to lower prices before the UK, then Brussels would ""need to take steps to ensure its cheaper power and gas did not 'leak' to the UK"". While Ms Starks says it would be highly unlikely that the EU would shut the interconnectors unilaterally, there would have to be some sort of regulation of trading and flows, in order to prevent leakage. And that would necessitate dialogue.

"The new PM Liz Truss has pledged to ""deliver on the energy crisis"" New Prime Minister Liz Truss will unveil plans to limit energy bill rises on Thursday, spending billions to protect people from soaring prices. Typical household energy bills could be capped at around Â£2,500 a year, with firms also likely to get some relief. It is unclear how long the support will last, but the government is expected to borrow at least Â£100bn to pay for it. Currently, a typical household's annual gas and electricity bill is due to rise from Â£1,971 to Â£3,549 in October. Experts and charities have warned that without help with soaring energy bills, lives will be at risk this winter, as people struggle to afford basic day-to-day living costs. However, the End Fuel Poverty Coalition pressure group estimates that if the energy price cap is frozen at Â£2,500, 6.9 million UK households will still be in fuel poverty this winter - up from 4.6 million last winter. The recent increase in consumers' bills follows sharp rises in wholesale gas prices largely due to the conflict in Ukraine, which has reduced supplies of Russian gas. Ahead of the announcement, Ms Truss said she knew families and firms were worried about ""how they are going to make ends meet this autumn and winter"". ""Putin's war in Ukraine and weaponisation of gas supply in Europe is causing global prices to rise - and this has only made clearer that we must boost our long-term energy security and supply,"" she said. She pledged to ""tackle the root cause of these problems, so that we are not in this position again"". To limit the amount customers' bills go up by, the government is expected to compensate energy firms for the difference between the wholesale price for gas and electricity they pay and the amount they can charge customers.

Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external WhatsApp:+44 7756 165803,external Tweet:@BBC_HaveYourSay,external Please read ourterms & conditionsandprivacy policy Customers will not be expected to repay the help, with the huge support package due to be funded by the government borrowing about Â£100bn. The final sum will depend on the cost of energy on the international energy markets - which can be extremely volatile - as well as whether additional support is offered to the most vulnerable households. But Labour said the government should extend a windfall tax on gas and oil company profits to pay for the package - with leader Sir Keir Starmerwarning that working people will be footing the billfor ""vast"" energy firm profits under her plans. Ed Miliband, the shadow secretary for climate change, told the BBC on Thursday: ""We know that the energy companies are making excess profits of Â£170bn over the next two years ""I cannot understand - apart from ideology and dogma - why the first port of call should not be [taxing] these excess profits."" The government is, however, planning a shake-up of the energy market, the BBC has learned. Following a series of meetings with officials, energy companies - mainly in the nuclear and renewables sector - have agreed in principle to accept new long-term contracts at fixed prices well below current rates, BBC climate editor Justin Rowlatt said. Most accept that the profits they are making currently are not sustainable during a national crisis, he added. However, Mr Miliband said accepting ""slightly lower prices now"" would mean ""much higher prices"" in future and be a ""terrible deal for billpayers"". Rocketing prices are leaving households facing eyewatering energy bills. Several councils are considering setting up ""warm banks"" - community spaces for people who cannot afford winter heating - while some teachers are warning of cuts to staff, school trips or courses to cover rising costs. Every household in the UKis already due to be given a one-off Â£400 discounton their fuel bills from October - a move announced by Ms Truss's defeated leadership rival Rishi Sunak while he was chancellor. And Â£650 will be paid to more than eight million low-income households who receive benefits or tax credits, alongsidefurther paymentsto pensioner households and disabled people. The current price cap - set by Ofgem and which limits the maximum amount domestic customers can be charged for each unit of energy - is due to increase in October. It will mean a typical household will pay Â£3,549 a year for their energy. Unlike households, businesses are not protected by an energy price cap. Many are currently facing even sharper rises in energy bills than households,which could lead to firms going underor cutting their wage bills by firing staff. But firms are also expected to receive some relief under the new plan. How high will energy bills go now? Pound falls to lowest level against dollar since 1985 What can I do if I can't pay my energy bill? Inflation may be 'significantly lower' under bills plan The system to support business could be more complex than that for households and is likely to be reviewed more often. According to reports, it could see the government force energy firms to offer specific reductions on the unit price of the energy used by firms. Business groups have welcomed the plan, although the British Chambers of Commerce warned ""it remains to be seen"" whether it goes far enough in providing the support that firms need. Abdul Shahid, who runs the Masala restaurant in Derby city centre, said his business needed help ""now, not three months later"". ""Our energy bills have more than doubled in many cases and all of our ingredients have gone up as well,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. ""We are definitely thinking about shutting our doors, it's very stressful."" Rosemary Brown, director of Bluebell Dairy, a luxury ice cream maker, said her energy costs had jumped from Â£35,000 a year to Â£80,000. That would rise to Â£225,000 a year if she renewed tomorrow, she added. ""We need help with capping the energy costs for the immediate future. We also strongly need to see some investment from the government in renewable energy so that 12 months along the line we've got systems in place."" If businesses are included, that could see the overall cost of the government support package rise to well above Â£100bn. The cost of UK government borrowing is currently at its highest level for eight years, with the yield on 10-year bonds rising above 3%. The rise in yield indicates investors' anticipation that the government will have to borrow more in future. It also means any future borrowing will be more expensive. However, some economists have suggested that plans to cap energy bills could mean that increases in the cost of living will peak earlier and be ""significantly lower"" than previously forecast. The cost of living is currently rising at its fastest rate in 40 years, with prices 10.1% higher than the same time last year. The rise is largely driven by the sharp rise in energy prices. Investment bank Goldman Sachs said that a cap on household energy bills could see inflation peak at 10.8% in October, rather than the 14.8% forecast before. It also sees prices falling more quickly as well, with inflation slowing to 2.4% by December 2023. The Bank of England also said the plan could slow rising prices. However, both cautioned that there was uncertainty around what exactly the plan will look like and what would happen once any cap is lifted. Economists also expect the UK to fall into a recession despite Ms Truss' energy support plan - albeit a shorter and less severe one. The Bank of England predicted the UK will enter a recession later this year - with the Bank's governor Andrew Bailey sayingthere is little that can be done to stop that happening. Meanwhile, Ms Truss is also reportedly set to announce she is scrapping the ban on fracking which was introduced in 2019 over concerns it was causing earth tremors. The controversial gas extraction technique involves drilling into the earth and directing a high-pressure solution at a rock layer to release the gas inside.

"This video can not be played Watch: Truss faces Starmer in her first PMQ's as PM Sir Keir Starmer has told Liz Truss working people will be footing the bill for ""vast"" energy firm profits under her plans to tackle the energy crisis. At her first Prime Minister's Questions, Ms Truss rejected Labour's call to extend a windfall tax on gas and oil company profits. Ms Truss also used her first full day as PM to appoint more ministers. Meanwhile, an online meeting between the Queen and senior politicianshas been postponed. Buckingham Palace said the Queen had been advised to rest after ""a full day"" on Tuesday during which she met the outgoing prime minister Boris Johnson and his successor Ms Truss. Latest developments as Truss and Starmer clash at first PMQs Bank warns it cannot stop UK falling into recession What can Liz Truss do to help people pay their bills? Under a plan, to be outlined by Ms Truss in the Commons on Thursday, the typical energy bill could be capped at about Â£2,500. The full details have yet to be revealed but the overall package is likely to total around Â£100bn. This will be paid for, in the short-term, by higher government borrowing, according to the new Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng, who had a meeting with bankers and other financial figures on Wednesday morning. At PMQs, Sir Keir told Ms Truss ""energy producers will make Â£170bn in excess profits over the next two years"". ""Is she really telling us that she is going to leave these vast excess profits on the table and make working people foot the bill for decades to come?"" the Labour leader asked. Ms Truss said she understood people were ""struggling with the cost of living"" and energy bills, which is why she would take ""immediate action to help people with the cost of their energy bills"". As Prime Minister's Questions finished, there appeared to be a warm, one-on-one brief chat between Liz Truss and Sir Keir Starmer. I think Sir Keir said ""well done"" to his opponent. All party leaders regularly acknowledge that PMQs is a tough gig. So how did it feel, and how did the main players perform? It felt less personal, much less theatrical and more ideological. Gone were the linguistic gymnastics of Boris Johnson, and the personal venom between the Conservative and Labour leaders. Judging either by this first outing is clearly ridiculous, it will take a while for both leaders to adjust to this new normal on a Wednesday lunchtime. But what is clear already is how different it will feel and the extent to which that will demand a very different approach from Sir Keir than the one he adopted with Boris Johnson. Liz Truss and Sir Keir Starmer chatting after Prime Minister's Questions The prime minister said she would reform the UK's overall energy mix by building more nuclear power stations and exploring more fossil fuel supplies in the North Sea. She argued extending the windfall tax on oil and gas companies would deter investment in the UK ""just when we need to be growing the economy"". Turning to Ms Truss's plan to halt planned tax rises on big business, Sir Keir accused her of ""protecting the profits of Shell and giving Amazon a tax break rather than helping families and public services"". Ms Truss said she was ""on the side of people who work hard and do the right thing"" and her plans would deliver new investment and new jobs ""right across our country"". Soaring energy bills mean firms close to collapse Liz Truss set to cut energy bills for millions Truss shelves plans to reform human rights law The Labour leader accused her of being part of a government that ""got us into this mess and now says how terrible it is"". ""Can't she see there's nothing new about a Tory prime minister who, when asked who pays, says 'it's you, the working people of Britain'?"" To cheers from Tory MPs, Ms Truss replied: ""There's nothing new about a Labour leader who is calling for more tax rises. It's the same old, same old tax and spend."" The SNP's leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford joined Sir Keir's attacks, describing ""a Truss tax, that household and businesses will be paying for years to come"". Downing Street later said the existing windfall tax - the Energy Profits Levy put in place by former Chancellor Rishi Sunak in May - would not be altered. The levy is an additional 25% tax on UK oil and gas profits and is due to last until the end of 2025. Ms Truss discussed the problem of rising energy bills in a phone call with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. No 10 said the two leaders discussed the importance of ""protecting countries made vulnerable by Russia's economic blackmail"", and the Northern Ireland Protocol. Following PMQs, Ms Trussannounced further appointmentsto her government, including some junior jobs for Sunak-supporting MPs such as Robert Jenrick who becomes a health minister. Former Brexit minister Steve Baker also makes a return to government, becoming a minister in the Northern Ireland Office.

"Apple has unveiled the iPhone 14, with emergency satellite connectivity and car crash detection technology, at a launch event in the US. The company revealed four versions of the new handset at its Cupertino headquarters, with an audience attending in person for the first time since the pandemic. It also showed off a new extreme sports wearable - the Watch Ultra. The event focused on next generation iPhone, Watch and AirPod products. Apple CEO Tim Cook was on stage at the Steve Jobs theatre inside the tech giant's California campus - but the presentation itself was entirely pre-recorded. Apple reveals iPhone 14 Pro and Watch Ultra Apple Watch Series 8 has a number of new features, including car crash detection, temperature sensors for tracking ovulation cycles and a new low-power mode option. People have been cautious about menstrual trackers since changes were made to abortion legislation in the US and there are concerns that data about periods could be used by law enforcement. Apple says the data on its devices will be encrypted and only accessible via a passcode or biometrics. ""We are taking our commitment to women's health even further,"" said Jeff Williams, chief operating officer at Apple. Apple said a new automatic retrospective ovulation notification could help those who are trying to conceive. If activated, the new watch can monitor body temperate every five seconds overnight, and detect tiny changes which can signal ovulation. Another new feature is car crash detection. Using sensors, the watch will be able to identify a severe crash and will automatically connect its wearer with emergency services, provide their exact location and notify emergency contacts. The Series 8 now also features a low power mode, a feature borrowed from the iPhone, that promises up to 36 hours of battery life on a full charge. The Apple Watch Series 8 is priced from $399 in the US, Â£419 in the UK. The new Apple Watch Ultra Swim-proof, dust-proof and crack-resistant - Apple has announced its rival to the likes of Garmin, Polar and other rugged watchmakers. Ultramarathoner Scott Jurek from Born to Run appeared in the presentation for the new watch, which focused on a larger face design for extreme sports use. All Ultra watches have up to 36 hours battery life on a single charge and an extended battery life of 60 hours, with Apple promising enough power for its customers to complete an ultra-triathlon which includes swimming, cycling and running. The Apple Watch Ultra is priced from $799 in the US, Â£849 in the UK. Apple CEO Tim Cook told the BBC it was ""good to be back"" in person The company is releasing the iPhone 14 in two sizes, the iPhone 14 and the iPhone 14 Plus. The new handsets are capable of sending an emergency call for help via satellite. The phone will display the whereabouts of passing satellites overhead and demonstrate how to point the device at them correctly. It can take from 15 seconds to a few minutes to send a basic message. ""The investment to add satellite capability should not be underestimated,"" said Ben Wood, chief analyst at CCS Insight. ""It will likely have taken Apple years to put all the pieces of the puzzle in place, including a commercial agreement with satellite provider Globalstar, and the creation of the infrastructure needed to pass messages to the emergency services."" Tech analyst Paolo Pescatore said he believed the innovation was good news for consumers ""in hard-to-reach areas"". ""It is encouraging to see providers starting to get serious about using satellite - ultimately reliable and robust connectivity is still highly sought-after among all users,"" he said. The tech giant announced a new 12-megapixel camera, capable of taking photos of fast-moving subjects, and the company claims a 49% improvement in low-light capturing. The front camera also included auto-focus for the first time, to help sharpen selfies. According to Apple, iPhone users took more than three trillion photos in the last 12 months. The iPhone 14 is priced from $799 (US), Â£849 (UK). The biggest change in iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max design is the top of the screen which is now a pill shaped cut-out. A feature called the Dynamic Island has replaced the black notch, which many iPhone users complain about - and it can change shape depending on what notifications there are. The other big change is that the handset can always remain on. When the phone is not in use, the screen dims and the refresh rate is lowered. The handset comes in a deep purple colour alongside black, silver and gold. The iPhone 14 Pro is priced at $999 (US), Â£1099 (UK). AirPods Pro are easier to find than their predecessors. Each pair comes with a new system for finding individual lost earphones, which play a chime when dropped outside of the case. Additionally, the case itself gets its own speaker, which will play a louder sound when prompted by the Find My app. The new AirPods Pro are priced at $249 (US), Â£249 (UK). Being here in person, among an enthusiastic crowd of Apple fans, certainly made for a more interesting launch than recent years. But nothing was announced today that is going to revolutionise the tech industry. Much of Apple's new tech seems ideal if you find yourself in some kind of peril on a regular basis.  The new iPhone 14 will be able to send texts by satellite when off the grid. The Ultra Watch design is chunky with extra-long battery life - the company says this is perfect for multi-day remote trips. Apple also announced a new crash detection system on new watches and phones, which will alert the emergency services when it detects an impact. The strategy here is pretty clear.

"Liz Truss has announced she will limit energy bill rises for all households until the next election People in Wales still face a ""difficult winter"" despiteLiz Truss's announcementthe government will cap average household energy bills at Â£2,500 a year, a charity has warned. The support will last for two years, starting in October. ""The announcement will provide some reassurance... However, this alone will not solve the cost of living crisis,"" Citizens Advice Cymru said. It added low income and vulnerable households would still struggle. The prime minister's two-year plan supersedes the existing energy price cap, and is in addition to the announced Â£400 energy bills discount for all households. Jacqui Cadogan, from Caldicot, Monmouthshire, was among those who had been calling for an energy price cap. ""People are struggling and we're hearing about all these big companies that are making billions of pounds in profit,"" she said prior to the PM's announcement. She had started turning plugs off and had bought sleeping bags, a tent and tea lights for winter, adding: ""I'm just preparing. Worst-case scenario. I just want to be ready for anything. Businesses are also getting a support package, but only for six months. Owners have been calling for urgent help for Welsh businesses, warning they may not survive the winter. Bridgend-based doughnut bakery WhoCult said its electricity costs had trebled in recent months. The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) said many businesses faced a ""cliff edge"" as energy deals ended. Liz Truss set to unveil plans to cut energy bills for millions What is the energy price cap? People who wish they had an energy price cap Peter's Pies Managing Director Mike Grimwood was among those who had called for a unit cap price for businesses such as his, based in Bedwas, Caerphilly county. He called the situation ""pretty stark"" prior to the announcement, adding: ""There's only one thing we can do - emergency price increases are being warned to our customers."" Other costs, including ingredients, have risen by 33%, he said. ""We are talking to all our customers and saying this a question of business survival."" Peter's Pies delivers baked products to consumers around Wales and further afield Scott Magill, the owner and founder of WhoCult Coffee and Donuts in Bridgend, said ""urgent help"" was needed. He had seen energy costs treble recently to Â£3,000 a month, just as the company expanded with a new shop in Barry, Vale of Glamorgan. ""I think a lot of businesses won't be able survive this winter,"" Mr Magill said. ""We have tightened our belt in many departments, but the cost of ingredients has gone up, the cost of electric has gone up, and something has got to give."" Mr Magill's business thrived through the Covid pandemic The business opened just before the Covid-19 pandemic, developing from a small doughnut outlet to a larger cafe and its own bakery. Mr Magill also runs a T-shirt printing company on the same site. While it has been a success and takings are up, the rising cost of ingredients and energy means it has become harder to make a profit. ""We have only recently noticed the rise in the energy cost, I would say in the last three to five months. That's especially since having this bakery, this bakery is only one year old,"" Mr Magill said. ""Unfortunately the cost of the rising electric, apart from turning off the odd plug, there is not much more we can do. A lot of equipment needs to stay on all day, every day, unfortunately. With us now making more doughnuts with a second store, they are in use more than normal."" There is concern over how small businesses will survive the winter without help Red Flag Alert, which monitors the financial health of firms, saidtens of thousands of businesses risked going underbecause of rising costs.

"The suspect in a stabbing that left 10 dead and 18 others injured has died after he was arrested by police, officials say Myles Sanderson, 32, was apprehended when police rammed his stolen vehicle off the road after a high-speed car chase Police say Sanderson went into ""medical distress"" after he was detained, and was taken to hospital where he was declared dead His capture in the town of Rosthern in Saskatchewan on Wednesday afternoon ends a giant manhunt that covered three provinces Both Myles Sanderson and his brother, Damien, were charged with murder over Sunday's massacre Damien Sanderson was found dead on Monday at James Smith Cree Nation - the indigenous community where most of the victims lived Edited by Rebecca Seales We're now ending our live coverage of the arrest and death of the main suspect in the stabbing spree that claimed the lives of 10 people in Canada on Sunday. Myles Sanderson died after experiencing ""medical distress"" after his arrest on Wednesday, police said, without giving further detail. They also declined to comment further on how his brother Damien, who is accused of helping in the murders, died earlier this week. His body was found on Monday, and police say they suspect his brother may have killed him. Our live coverage was provided by Max Matza, Holly Honderich, Jessica Murphy, Nadine Yousif, Robin Levinson-King and Grace Conley, and edited by Rebecca Seales. Canadian PM Justin Trudeau will be holding a news conference on Thursday from the west coast city of Vancouver. It's safe to assume that he'll be asked extensively about the investigation by journalists there. Earlier on Thursday, he plans to speak on the phone with US President Joe Biden. Trudeau has been introducing tough new anti-gun laws in recent months, last monthimposing a total ban on the import of handguns. It remains to be seen what his administration can do to prevent future mass stabbing attacks. Jessica MurphyBBC News, Prince Albert, Saskatchewan In a story that has had many twists, there was a final one this evening: that suspect Myles Sanderson died after being taken into custody. And in a story that also has many unresolved questions, there was another to add: the circumstances of that death, particularly given photos have emerged that seem to show him standing up as he was being arrested. RCMP Assistant Commissioner Rhonda Blackmore didn't have many answers to offer. Asked if he could have died from an overdose - he had a documented history of substance abuse - Blackmore gave no more details. She also refused to say whether Narcan, a drug given to stop overdoses, was administered. ""I can't speak to the specific manner of death"", she said, adding that how he died was part of the ongoing investigation. Here's what we've just heard from police: The police press conference is over. They confirmed that Myles Sanderson died following his arrest, but did not provide details on how he died. They said more would be revealed as the investigation continued, and urged the public to continue to share information pertaining to the case. Blackmore said it's traumatic for victims to recount memories. The investigation has included more than 100 interviews with victims and witnesses and members of the public. ""People want to understand what happened here and how that unfolded,"" she said. She acknowledged this was just the first step in victims' healing process and that many questions remain unanswered. ""They can rest easy tonight knowing that Myles Sanderson is no longer a threat to them,"" she said. Damien Sanderson was found dead on Monday, after being named a suspect and charged with first-degree murder along with his brother. His body was found near other victims around James Smith Cree Nation. ""At this point in time, he is considered a suspect in the homicides that were committed,"" Blackmore says. Police said his injuries did not appear self-inflicted at the time. They did not elaborate during Wednesday's press conference. As people hear updates from police on Myles Sanderson's arrest, several gathered in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan for a sombre vigil. ""Tomorrow we start the process on our grieving"", said James Smith Cree Nation chief Wally Burns to mourners, some of whom wiped away tears. âIâm holding back a lot of hurt, a lot of anger. I wish this was just a dream, but itâs not.â It is one of several vigils that have taken place or are planned for the coming days in honour of the 10 victims who died in the mass stabbing attacks. A collective prayer for James Smith Cree Nation and Weldon residents will also take place at First Nations University of Canada in Regina on Friday. Words of solidarity have poured in from across the nation and around the world. The Queen has also sent her condolences, with a statement earlier today saying she was mourning ""with all Canadians at this tragic time"". Police say there were signs the now-deceased suspect was injured before his arrest. Initial reports on Wednesday, when he was spotted near Wakaw, indicated he may have had an injury. A vehicle was broken into in Weldon, after the attacks on Sunday, and it appeared he may have stolen a first-aid kit. Jessica MurphyBBC News, Prince Albert, Saskatchewan Police in Saskatchewan were quick to send out mobile phone alerts to residents shortly after they realised that a mass attack was taking place. Over the last few days, loud emergency phone alerts with updates on the manhunt became commonplace. These types of alerts are usually sent for missing children or extreme weather events. People I spoke to here were on the fence about the alerts and their frequency. Some felt they were useful information that helped residents to remain cautious and aware. Others thought it was added stress amid the terrible news. But this response suggested that the RCMP - the Royal Canadian Mounted Police - had shifted public communication tactics in the wake of another killing spree in Canada. In Nova Scotia, a maritime province on Canada's east coast, a commission is looking into the police response to a mass shooting when a gunman, posing as a police officer, killed 22 people over the course of two days in April 2020. One of the main issues being looked into at the inquiry?  Why the force failed to use the provincial alert system to warn people of the danger. The last alert sent by police announcing a sighting of the suspect The assistant commissioner continues that police have conducted more than 120 interviews so far in connection with the case as they try to piece together what happened. Asked about the suspect's Myles Sanderson's brother, who was discovered dead on Monday, police say they are not prepared yet to say how he died. ""We may not know how some things unfolded,"" she says. Blackmore says it remains unclear how Damien died, and ""how that unfolded between the two of them"". Asked about the suspect's possible motive, the RCMP assistant commissioner says his motivation ""may at this time and forever just be known to Myles"". Police are now taking questions from journalists in Regina, and have refused to give more detail as to how Sanderson died. ""He was the only occupant of the vehicle when he was arrested,"" says the RCMP assistant commissioner. ""Shortly after being arrested he went into medical distress,"" she says, repeating her earlier statement. She says a post-mortem examination will determine how he died. ""I can't speak to the specific manner of death"", she says, saying how he died is part of the ongoing investigation. Police are now repeating their statement in French, one of Canada's two official languages alongside English. The Saskatchewan RCMP chief adds that she visited the affected communities today, and personally witnessed the ""generosity and support"" of the residents there. She adds her appreciation to all the police officers involved in the search, which took place over an area about half the size of Europe. Police spotted the white truck that he had stolen, and after stopping him, ""through verbal identification, confirmed the driver to Myles Sanderson,"" says Assistant Commissioner Blackmore. ""He was arrested by police and taken into custody. A knife was discovered inside his vehicle,"" she says. ""Shortly after his arrest he went into medical distress,"" she continued without describing how he died. The suspect's stolen vehicle Police have confirmed that Myles Sanderson died shortly after he was arrested earlier on Wednesday, after going into ""medical distress"". ""This evening our province is breathing a collective sigh of relief as Myles Sanderson is no longer at large,"" says Assistant Commissioner Blackmore, beginning her statement. She is now going through a timeline of the police response. Police first arrived at the James Smith Cree Nation at 06:18 on Sunday, she says. ""The magnitude of this investigation is immense,"" she continues. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) are now giving an update from the Mounties' regional headquarters in Regina, the capital of Saskatchewan. RCMP Assistant Commissioner Rhonda Blackmore, who leads the Saskatchewan RCMP, will be speaking. Many questions remain unanswered, including how people were stabbed across two communities in a short space of time, and why police failed to track down Myles Sanderson when he ceased contact with his parole officer. Police say they have will only permit journalists to ask question for 20 minutes after making a statement. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played ""Lovely to have you with us"" - headmaster greets the Cambridge children The Cambridge ""gang"" have started a new chapter together, walking hand-in-hand with their parents on the first day at their new school. Prince George, nine, Princess Charlotte, seven, and Prince Louis, four, are all starting at Lambrook School, in Berkshire, after the family's recent move to Windsor. For little Louis, in summer uniform, it was his very first day at school. His older siblings previously attended Thomas's Battersea in London. On the settling-in day, the duke referred to his children as ""all the gang"", ushering them up the steps of the private school. Headmaster Jonathan Perry was on hand to greet the young royals, shaking each of them by the hand and saying it was ""lovely to have you with us"". Asked if they were excited, all three replied ""yes"" and Prince William said they were ""all looking forward to it"" and had ""lots of questions"". The siblings showed no obvious signs of nerves as they walked confidently into Lambrook in the sunshine holding their parents' hands. Earlier, they had been forced to dodge the showers after pulling up in the school's grounds. Parents arriving later were hit by torrential rain. As the family walked towards the school entrance in front of two cameras, they could be heard laughing and Prince William was seen stroking Prince Louis' hair reassuringly. The children's first full day is on Thursday, the official start of term. The Cambridge children are all smiles on the way to their new school Lambrook School headmaster Jonathan Perry greets the young royals This will be a privileged education. Annual fees for all three children will be more than Â£53,000. The school sits in 52 acres of Berkshire countryside close to Ascot Racecourse. It has a nine-hole golf course and swimming pool as well as bees, chickens and pigs for pupils to look after. Some children are boarders at the school but, for now, the Cambridges will be day pupils. In 1990, his parents Prince Charles and Princess Diana accompanied William on his first day at Ludgrove Preparatory School near Wokingham, Berkshire In 2017, Prince George started at Thomas's Battersea in London Princess Charlotte was greeted by one of the teachers at Thomas's Battersea on her first day in 2019 Marking a first day at school has become a royal rite of passage. Earlier, a single photographer and one TV camera filmed the Cambridge family as they arrived at Lambrook. The footage was then shared across a number of media organisations. Limiting the number of cameras and journalists is a way of protecting the children from the public glare. The hope is that a managed glimpse into life at Lambrook will afford the family some privacy at school from now on. It was very different when William started school. In the late-80s and mid-90s, he faced a barrage of cameras as he started nursery and then school, always accompanied by his mother and often his father. To cries of ""William"" or ""Diana"" those nervous, first steps into school were a major media event. When he started Eton in 1995, cameras were even allowed to follow him as he walked to his first lesson. Such access just would not happen now. These milestones are still recorded but royal children are no longer as exposed on these significant days. Prince William's sister-in-law, the Duchess of Sussex, recently discussed her concerns about her son Archie attending school in the UK duringan interview with US magazine The Cut. Meghan said she would not have been able to pick up Archie from school in the UK ""without it being a royal photo call with a press pen of 40 people snapping pictures"" and said that was something she had a problem with. The Editors' Code of Practice, the rules from the Independent Press Standards Organisation newspapers and magazines follow, prevents photographing children at school. George, Charlotte and Louis can stay at Lambrook until they are 13 years old. The school says its aims to create ""happy and thoughtful young adults who are global citizens"". Lambrook has some royal history, with two of Queen Victoria's grandsons, Prince Christian Victor and Prince Albert of Schleswig-Holstein, having been pupils. During their time at the school, Queen Victoria used to travel from Windsor Castle to watch them in plays and cricket matches.
