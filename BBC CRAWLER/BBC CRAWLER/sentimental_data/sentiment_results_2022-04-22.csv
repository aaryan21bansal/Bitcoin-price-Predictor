"P&O Ferries services were suspended after the company sacked 800 workers The first P&O ferry that operates from Dover to Calais has been cleared to sail again. The Spirit of Britain had been detained by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA). It has been conducting trial sails up and down the English coast between Dover and New Romney, a marine traffic website has shown. Safety fears were raised afterP&O replaced nearly 800 seafarers with cheaper agency staff last month. The marine traffic website, which shows the live positions of ships, reports the ferry's destinations as ""TRIALS"". P&O tweeted on Saturday morning that its services remain suspended. The MCA previously said the Spirit of Britain ""has been released from detention and can commence operations when P&O Ferries are ready"". The firm suspended most of its sailings but reportedly only expected the disruption to last up to 10 days. However inspections prevented a number of ferries from operating, which contributed to major travel disruption near Dover in the run-up to, and during the, Easter holidays. Dover queues 'worst seen since Christmas 2020' P&O Ferries preparing to restart Dover-Calais route Lorries carrying fresh meat in 24-hour Dover queues When the Spirit of Britain was detained earlier this month, P&O Ferries were told to fix a number of safety issues before a second inspection by the MCA. P&O operates four ferries across the English Channel between Dover and Calais. The Pride of Kent remains under the detention of the MCA and two other P&O ferries on this route have yet to be inspected. The removal of these four P&O ferries from service had a substantial impact on passenger and freight traffic, affecting both holidays and trade. The Easter holidays created a major bottleneck, as thousands of lorries queued to cross the channel alongside families going on holiday in Europe. There were also problems with a key IT system for custom checks at the UK's busiest port after Brexit. The last week has seen problems ease as holidays ended, which meant capacity has improved. Trade volumes are often lower in the week after a major bank holiday. The European Highlander, a P&O ferry that operates between Larne in Northern Ireland and Cairnryan in Scotland, has been found to have a ""small number of deficiencies"" that need to be addressed before it can resume service, the MCA said. P&O currently has one ferry, the European Causeway, operating on this route between Scotland and Northern Ireland. Other ferries that have been inspected and cleared to sail by the MCA include the Pride of Hull, Norbay and the European Causeway. The Pride of Hull, which operates between Hull and Rotterdam; Norbay, which runs from Liverpool to Dublin; European Causeway (Larne - Cairnryan) and Spirit of Britain (Dover - Calais) have been inspected and cleared to sail by the MCA.

"Five-year-old Logan Mwangi was described as a ""really sweet, happy-go-lucky child"" by a neighbour A man who murdered his five-year-old stepson was a known racist with a string of previous convictions. John Colewas found guilty of the murder of Logan Mwangi,alongside the little boy's mother Angharad Williamson and a 14-year-old boy, on Thursday. Cole, 40, and Williamson, 31, claimed they were excellent parents. But witnesses painted a different picture. During and after the trial, the couple's lies have unravelled to reveal a dark past. Mum, stepdad and teen guilty of murder of boy, 5 How CCTV helped police catch Logan's killers Lies told by three murderers exposed by CCTV Logan's body was found in the River Ogmore, close to his home in Sarn, Bridgend county, in July 2021. He died after suffering a ""brutal and sustained"" attack at home, leaving him with ""catastrophic"" injuries, which experts also said could have only been caused by a ""brutal and sustained assault"". Following the trial, BBC Wales can reveal the racist past of the five-year-old's stepfather and how his mother went from private schoolgirl to murdering her own child. This video can not be played Police found Logan Mwangi's body in a river near his home - he was wearing a pair of dinosaur pyjama bottoms and a Spider-Man top Martial arts fan Cole, who grew up in Rugby, Warwickshire, told people he had served in the SAS. But during his 20s he was associated with the National Front, a fascist political party, and was known to be ""very racist"". He had claimed to have put his racist past behind him but those who knew him, including friend Jodie Symmonds, said he used racial slurs against his mixed race stepson. Williamson and Cole were both named - but why is the 14-year-old's identity being protected? It is throughsection 45 of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act,external, which means no victim, witness or defendant under 18 can be named in court proceedings. This order is the ""default position with regards to the welfare of the child, even if it is a serious crime"", said Cardiff University law lecturer Dr Julie Doughty. She points to rare occasions it has been challenged by the press and lifted by judges  - such as the case of 16-year-old schoolboy Will Cornick, from Leeds,who admitted murdering teacherAnn Maguire. It has also been done recently in a case in Cardiff - with the judge lifting restrictions on the identity of Dionne Timms-Williams,who was 16 when she took partin a homophobic murder - after she was convicted. ""When he reaches 18, the order will expire and if the media are still interested, he can be identified,"" Dr Doughty added. However, there are exceptions. For example,the murderers of James Bulgerhave lifelong anonymity. Robert Thompson and Jon Venables were 10 when they tortured and killed the toddler in Liverpool and while they were named at the time, Dr Doughty said a judge deemed they would need new identities on release because it was ""such an extreme case and will never be forgotten"". Friends said Cole told them he did not like Logan and witnessed him making the young boy do press-ups to teach him a lesson, stand in the naughty corner for extensive periods of time and make him watch others eat takeaway while he was only given cereal. He has a string of previous convictions, including robbery, blackmail, witness intimidation and three previous offences of perverting the course of justice, according to the PA news agency. He was said to have encouraged the 14-year-old boy - who was also found guilty of Logan's murder, but cannot be named for legal reasons - to assault Logan using martial arts manoeuvres he had learned. Angharad Williamson and John Cole had claimed to be excellent parents Williamson's claims of being a loving mother with the ""perfect little family"" were shattered as she was found guilty of murdering her own child. The daughter of a stockbroker, she grew up in Essex with a twin brother and younger brother and attended a fee-paying primary school, according to the PA news agency. But before she had even met Cole, she had already turned to a life of dishonesty and violence. She was charged with two counts of theft after making unauthorised payments on her mother's credit card. On another occasion, with a boyfriend, she stole her mother's car and was punished in court with a community order and unpaid work. This video can not be played Logan Mwangi's dad said the world was colder and darker without his son Shortly after that, Williamson met Benjamin Mwangi and by June 2015 the couple were expecting a child. Logan was born in March 2016, but his parents' relationship soon failed. Later that year she got together with Jordan Hunt, a soldier, and they married in August 2017. The relationship turned violent and by January 2019 the marriage was over. Months later, Williamson moved with Logan to a council flat in Bridgend and soon met John Cole in a local pub. This video can not be played Tim Thomas said one man had donated a bench Despite Cole being in a relationship with someone else, Williamson fell pregnant. During the trial, Williamson claimed the relationship changed when Logan's father resumed contact with his son. Cole is said to have stopped Logan seeing his father - jealously believing Ben Mwangi was having an affair with Williamson. After Logan's death, she told detectives she was scared of Cole because he had claimed to have served in the SAS. The five-year-old's body was found in the River Ogmore Cole also said he was subject to an indeterminate sentence ofImprisonment for Public Protection (IPP),external- designed to protect the public from serious offenders whose crimes did not merit a life sentence - and could ""find her"" wherever she went. Williamson was described as loud, with a tendency to use foul language and switch moods easily. Her mother Clare, who sat for most of the trial in the public gallery and for a time was seen reading Richard Osman's The Thursday Murder Club, said her daughter had been ""dramatic"" since she was a child. Throughout most of the trial, Williamson sobbed from the dock and repeatedly called Cole a ""liar"", imploring him to ""tell the truth"" while giving evidence. It was revealed she was an avid watcher of YouTube videos on blackhead removal and Dr Pimple Popper and had watched more than 300 clips between October 2019 and August 2021. As a mother, to many she appeared loving, but with a tendency to be ""overbearing"" or ""overprotective"". Others said they observed her shouting at her children, and at times seemed ambivalent to Cole's harsh treatment of Logan. Angharad Williamson, and her partner, John Cole, were found guilty of Logan's murder at Cardiff Crown Court Speaking to Radio Wales Breakfast, child protection expert Jim Gamble, who is chief executive of the INEQE child safeguarding organisation, said he was ""sickened listening to the evidence and delighted that people have been held to account"". But he added: ""That won't bring Logan back."" ""Everyone will be looking at their children this morning, thinking how could any human being, let alone a mother and stepfather, do this to a child? ""I think we need to be really careful that we don't knee-jerk to demonize social care, police, educators, health professional that may have been involved. ""We're talking about extremely manipulative parents - they disguise their compliance. ""I am confident that everybody involved will simply want these lessons to be learned. ""They're doing a very difficult job and they'll be sick to their stomachs about this.""

"Alan Barratt and Susan Dalton Two fraudsters have been jailed for their part in a series of scams in which 245 people lost millions of pounds in pension savings. Alan Barratt, 62, and Susan Dalton, 66, tricked people into transferring savings to schemes supposedly investing in property or ""truffle trees"". One victim told the BBC that the fraudsters had wanted to secure their own pension ""by taking mine instead"". Barratt and Dalton admitted fraud based on their roles as pension trustees. More than Â£13m of pension savings were transferred, and the pair forwarded most of the money to the mastermind of the criminal enterprise, David Austin, from Guildford in Surrey. A previous case heard evidence that he used it to live a life of luxury including ski holidays and trips to Dubai. It was funnelled offshore and funded his businesses, was used to pay others involved in the operation, and enriched himself and family members. He killed himself in 2019, before the criminal investigation was completed. At Southwark Crown Court on Friday, Barratt was jailed for five years and seven months while Dalton was jailed for four years and eight months. Both stood and looked straight ahead in the dock as the sentences were handed down. Passing sentence, Judge Gregory Perrins said the pair caused ""such misery to so many people"", with victims suffering mental health problems and some even attempting suicide. ""Each account that I have read is a story of a life ruined by your actions and you should both be ashamed,"" he said. Former mineworker Stephen O'Reilly was among their victims, lost more than Â£100,000, and now has to work in a bookmakers to pay his bills. ""My pension has gone. I am going to have to work for the rest of my life,"" the 62-year-old said. Stephen O'Reilly thought he was investing in overseas property He answered an advert for a free pension review 10 years ago, in the hope he could release some funds to renovate and sell homes in Spain. ""My kids are grown up but I wanted to make some money to leave to them,"" he told the BBC. The supposed review led to a call from Dalton after which he transferred Â£114,000 in pension savings. He was given a small commission, which was actually part of his own pension, and told some of the money would be invested in overseas property. He expected to receive a lump sum at the age of 55, and had even ordered a new car in anticipation. The money never arrived and when he enquired, he discovered he had been the victim of a scam. Previously, his mineworker's pension from 14 years working underground had been inappropriately transferred and he received compensation. This time, the money had disappeared entirely. ""It is a lesson learnt, and now I can only hope some other people will learn from my lesson,"" he said. Pauline Padden had received a text about a pension review when she was 50, and eventually transferred Â£45,000 - thinking she was investing in property in holiday resorts in the Caribbean. She became suspicious when she did not receive any paperwork, and was then notified that she had been the victim of a scam. Pauline Padden works as a critical care nurse ""If that money had been properly invested, it would have meant I could retire when I wanted to retire,"" said Mrs Padden, 58, who has been a critical care nurse for 40 years. ""Now that has been completely taken from me. It has gone forever. I'm not sure I will ever see that money again - I doubt it."" She said the experience had left her anxious and she finds it hard to trust people. Her family are worried about her. ""I felt stupid. I felt duped. That is not a nice feeling to have,"" she said, urging others to be wary of similar offers. While she faces many more years working in the stressful surroundings of the NHS, she describes those behind the scam as ""greedy"" and hopes their conviction will be a deterrent to others. ""They are not much different in age than me. They were looking for their own pension pot, and decided to take mine instead - and that of many people as well as me,"" she said. ""I was just trying to secure a future so I wouldn't have to depend on the state, but they have just happily and willingly stolen that money off me. They knew when they were taking it. They knew, and they just took it anyway."" Barratt, Dalton, and Austin were among those who ran 10 dishonest pension schemes. In 2018, Austin and Barratt were ordered to repay Â£7.7m and Austin and Dalton Â£5.9m to those who had lost out. However, none of the victims have yet to receive a penny of the money they should have been refunded. The High Court ruling,reported by the BBC at the time, was a legal first as it came after an application from The Pensions Regulator, which had been granted new powers. One victim in that case said he and his wife were assured their pensions would be invested in low-risk investments. They were then sent details of a firm producing so-called truffle trees in the West Country. Criminal investigations followed the civil proceedings, which culminated in Friday's sentencing. Call for crackdown on financial scammers Impact of scams on wellbeing calculated as Â£9bn Barratt, of Burnham Road, Althorne, Essex, and Dalton, 66, of Brookdale, Rochdale, Lancashire, both admitted charges of fraud by abuse of position in breach of the Fraud Act 2006 arising from their roles as trustees of pension schemes. In addition to their jail terms, both have been banned from being directors of companies for eight years. A confiscation hearing, to recover what might remain of the profits of the scam, is set to take place in November. On Friday, Southwark Crown Court heard that Barratt, an ""unsophisticated"" former photocopier salesman, trusted Austin and did not want to ""rock the boat"" because he was paid more than he had ever been paid before. Initially, he believed what he was doing was lawful, the court heard. In mitigation for Dalton, the court heard that she ""turned a blind eye"" to the fraud. In a statement read in court, she said she apologised to victims and punished herself every single day for her part in the fraud. Pensions minister Guy Opperman said he welcomed the sentence and thanked the Pensions Regulator ""for its role in bringing the perpetrators to justice"". Lead lawyer for the regulator, Carl Dowling, branded the scam ""despicable"", adding the sentence sent ""a clear message"". ""Pension scams ruin lives. Barratt and Dalton's crimes have had a devastating impact on their victims,"" he said.

"Carlos Ghosn spoke to the BBC from Lebanon where he is banned from leaving the country Fugitive former Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn has said he wants to stand trial on charges of financial wrongdoing in order to clear his name. He spoke to the BBC after France issued an international warrant for his arrest, citing allegedly suspect payments. Mr Ghosn said he was ""expecting"" the move though he was ""surprised at the timing"". Mr Ghosn faced charges of financial misconduct when he fled Japan in 2019. The former head of Nissan, once one of the most powerful figures in the car industry, is currently unable to leave Lebanon, as he is the subject of an Interpol Red Notice issued by Japan. He told the BBC: ""I want to stand trial because that's the only way I can get rid of the Red Notice which today forbids me from leaving Lebanon."" He said he wanted a trial in Lebanon on the charges brought against him in Japan, and any that emerge from the French investigation -  and was ""totally confident"" he could prove his innocence. The downfall of the god of cars Ex-Nissan boss Ghosn: How I escaped Japan in a box Four charts on the Carlos Ghosn scandal Prosecutors in France are investigating claims that Mr Ghosn funnelled millions of euros from Renault through Suhail Bahwan Automobiles. According to reports first published inthe Wall Street Journal,,externalhe used the money for personal purchases including that of a 120-foot yacht. An investigating magistrate in France has now issued five international arrest warrants against Mr Ghosn and four people linked to a car distributor in Oman. Mr Ghosn told the BBC on Friday: ""There was not one euro [from Nissan or Renault] that ended up benefitting me directly or indirectly"". He denied he was a fugitive from justice - and repeated previous claims he had left Japan because he would not have had a fair trial there. Mr Ghosn said the charges against him were part of a conspiracy to derail his plans for a full merger between Renault and Nissan. Since his escape, Carlos Ghosn has repeatedly claimed that the charges against him in Japan were baseless. They were, he maintains, part of a conspiracy, designed to prevent him from orchestrating a merger between Nissan and its French partner Renault. But for several years a separate investigation has been quietly taking place in France. An investigating magistrate recently questioned Mr Ghosn at length in Beirut. The decision to issue an international arrest warrant suggests the French side believes there is a genuine case to answer at least. Mr Ghosn has said he would be happy to stand trial in France to clear his name, and his lawyers seem confident that would happen. But there's a problem. The former executive is banned from leaving Lebanon because he is still subject to an extradition request from Japan, even though that request is highly unlikely to be granted. For the moment, he remains in a legal limbo. Mr Ghosn once ran the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance, one of the biggest car-making groups in the world. He was arrested in Japan in late 2018, and faced a number of charges, including claims he deliberately mis-reported his earnings and used company money to fund his own lifestyle. He denied any wrongdoing. He has previously spoken of his dramatic escape from Japan, which involved disguising himself to go unnoticed through the streets of Tokyo, being hidden in a large music equipment box and fleeing to his native Lebanon as he awaited trial. Mr Ghosn, who holds Brazilian, Lebanese and French passports, cannot be extradited to France from Beirut, although he confirmed to the BBC that he has been questioned as part of the investigation. He said he thought France had issued the arrest warrant because under its law the investigation could not be closed unless he was in French territory. ""So in a certain way we were expecting something like this to happen,"" he said. ""What was surprising was the timing...and also that we knew about it through an American newspaper...without me being officially alerted."" Earlier, his lawyer, Jean Tamalet at King & Spalding, told the BBC: ""We believe this move is the only technical resort they found to be able in the future to try the case in a court of law."" Warrants were also issued against the current owners and former directors of the car distributor, Suhail Bahwan Automobiles. The Omani firm did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment.

"Some supermarkets are limiting how much cooking oil customers are able to buy as supplies are hit by war in Ukraine. Tesco is allowing three items per customer. Waitrose and Morrisons have limited shoppers to two items each. The majority of the UK's sunflower oil comes from Ukraine and disruption to exports has led to some shortages and an increased demand for alternatives. The British Retail Consortium says the restrictions are a temporary measure ""to ensure availability for everyone."" Olive, rapeseed and sunflower oils are included in the limits being put in place by some supermarkets, both in-store and online. Iceland have not yet commented on pictures posted on social media of signs that have appeared in its stores limiting sales of two-litre and five-litre bottles of sunflower oil to one per customer. Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Waitrose said: ""We are closely monitoring the situation and working with our suppliers to ensure customers continue to have a choice of cooking oils."" Signage at a Tesco store in Hatfield showed customers were limited to three per customer. Grocery expert Ged Futter says shoppers can be reassured that there are plenty of alternatives when it comes to cooking oils. ""We are used to an abundance of varieties, what we may see is that they become more limited,"" he says. But he also warned that sunflower oil may soon be unavailable on the shelves. ""These limits may delay things a bit, but in a couple of months, there won't be any sunflower oil available to buy,"" he suggests. Sainsbury's and Asda are not currently limiting how much cooking oil their customers can buy. A spokesperson for Sainsbury's said: ""We are working closely with our suppliers to make sure customers continue to have cooking oils to choose from including olive oil, vegetable oil and rapeseed oil."" Tom Holder from the British Retail Consortium said that the restrictions being put in place by some supermarkets are a temporary measure, ""to ensure availability for everyone."" He added that ""retailers are working with suppliers to ramp up production of alternative cooking oils, to minimise the impact on consumers."" Morrisons has also introduced limits on the purchase of cooking oils. Analysis by retail research firm Assosia also suggests that the reduced supply of sunflower oil as a result of the conflict in Ukraine is having an impact on prices. It has tracked changes in the average cost of sunflower oil across major retailers including Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda, Morrisons, Aldi and Lidl. Its data suggests that a one-litre bottle of own-brand sunflower oil has gone up by an average of 12p to Â£1.26 since January 2022 - an increase of more than 10%. For a five-litre bottle, the increase was 38p or 6%. There had been no change in the average price of a one-litre of own-brand organic sunflower oil, which stood at Â£3.10. UK food manufacturers that use sunflower oil as an ingredient in their products, such as crisps and oven chips, have also reported concerns over supplies. The Food Standards Agency and Food Standards Scotland have told consumers that some products labelled as containing sunflower oil may in fact contain alternatives such as rapeseed oil, in a move to try and make sure products remain available.

"This video can not be played Watch Fury and Whyte weigh in before heavyweight bout at Wembley Tyson Fury v Dillian Whyte: WBC heavyweight title Venue:Wembley Stadium, LondonDate:Saturday, 23 April Coverage:Live text commentary on BBC Sport website and app from 20:00 BST WBC and Ring Magazine champion Tyson Fury weighed in 12lb lighter than his previous fight for Saturday's blockbuster heavyweight bout against Dillian Whyte at Wembley. Fury, 33, hit the scales at 18st 12lb, while challenger Whyte weighed in at 18st 1lb. The two Britons will fight in front of 94,000 fans - a post-war British record - with Fury making a second defence of the title he wonagainst Deontay Wilderin February 2020. The Sports Desk podcast: Kinahan, Fury and the state of boxing How 'throwback fighter' Whyte became a world title contender Steward on bond with heavyweight world champion Fury Fury's drop in weight from thefinal bout in the Wilder trilogyin October gives a slight indication as to how he may approach the fight. Against Wilder, Fury went toe-to-toe with the big-punching American. Weighing in lighter suggests Fury may revert back to fighting at range and using his quick feet and movement to outbox Whyte. Whyte, dressed in all black, took to the stage first and was dealt a chorus of boos by the Fury-friendly crowd at BoxPark in Wembley. The 34-year-old's self-imposed media silence before the fight left many wondering what shape he would come in, but Whyte looked in good condition and is 6lb heavier than when he knocked out Alexander Povetkin in March 2021. Fury then made his way to the scales. Wearing a white, blue and red tracksuit, the 'Gypsy King' paraded his WBC belt to a pumped-up crowd. The fighters have shared several social media spats over the years but, just as it was at Wednesday's media conference, there was a jovial atmosphere with no signs of any bad blood. They jokingly tickled each other, shook hands and then swapped baseball caps. Fury and Whyte almost resembled a double act and gave in the demands of an audience wanting an encore when they returned to the stage. They danced in unison to some music, throwing their hands in the air while bouncing on the spot. On Wednesday Fury and Whyte calmed down their respective entourages when matters got heated between the two teams. At the weigh-in, Team Fury and Team Whyte reconciled as the fighters' brothers embraced on stage. All media commitments and obligatory fight week events are done. The next time these two men lock eyes will be inside the ropes on Saturday evening.

But Fury - who has won 31 bouts, with 22 knockouts, and drawn one - has suggested he will retire this weekend regardless of the outcome. Whyte is challenging for a world title for the first time, having won 28 bouts, with 19 stoppages. He has two losses on his record - against Joshua in 2015 and a knockout loss toAlexander Povetkinin August 2020, although heavenged his defeatby the Russian seven months later.

"Police described Christopher Hughes as a ""dangerous individual"". A member of a major Scottish crime gang has been jailed for at least 25 years for the murder of a Dutch crime writer outside a sex club. Christopher Hughes lured Martin Kok, 49, to his death before he was shot eight times by a gunman in Laren, in the Netherlands, on 8 December 2016. Police described Hughes, 33, as a ""dangerous individual"" after he wasconvicted last month. He was part of a global enterprise that generated more than Â£100m a year. Hughes, originally from Glasgow, was also found guilty of involvement in serious organised crime between July 2013 and January 2020. Martin Kok died outside a club near Amsterdam in 2016 It was investigated as part of Police Scotland's Operation Escalade. Sentencing Hughes at the High Court in Stirling the judge, Lady Scott, said the murder was a ruthless ""execution."" Kok was a convicted killer, turned crime writer, who had set up a website detailing the activities of criminals in his homeland. During the trial it emerged Hughes met him at an Amsterdam hotel, then the Boccaccio sex club and alerted others to where he was. Martin Kok: Gangland figure guilty of murdering Dutch crime writer Martin Kok: Jurors shown footage of crime blogger's murder When the pair left the club Hughes paused to stroke a cat, before Kok was gunned down as a ""favour"" for seemingly angering Moroccan gangsters. Hughes was quizzed by Dutch police the next day, but was allowed to leave as the international probe into the shooting continued. It was his apparent confession to a fellow gang member-turned-informer which lead to his downfall. Hughes was arrested at a hotel in Turin, Italy in January 2020 and flown back to Scotland on a European Arrest Warrant. The court heard Hughes was a trusted member of heavily-armed group, which was part of a vast criminal network. Firearms traded by the organised gang were also used to enforce the gang's lucrative drugs operations It had links with gangs across the globe, from Colombian drug cartels to the Italian mafia. The group even invested in state-of-the-art surveillance equipment in a bid to establish if their network had been compromised by the authorities. During the trial at the High Court in Glasgow jurors were shown a photo of Hughes smiling with the two wanted men who run the operation. They cannot be identified for legal reasons. Hughes was listed by HMRC as ""unemployed"" but ""wages"" of Â£40,000-a-week earned him a luxury lifestyle in the Algarve. The informer explained to jurors in evidence that he was told to set a meeting up in an Amsterdam hotel between Hughes and Kok. He told the court he believed the meeting was to discuss advertising for the firm's encrypted phone company MPC, which was funded with Â£1m of dirty money, on Kok's new crime TV show. The downfall of Scotland's most dangerous crime gang The murder was originally due to happen outside the Citizen M Hotel in Amsterdam. But 11 months later, during a ""play by play"" of events at his flat in Antwerp, Belgium, Hughes told the informant that the gun had jammed and a second attempt was made later on the same day. Hours later, the court heard, Hughes paid for Kok's evening at the sex club and supplied him with cocaine. The informant stated that he was speaking to his crime boss on the night of the incident. ""He [the boss] had been on about someone waiting for Martin Kok and Christopher Hughes was to hold back,"" he said. ""Martin left just ahead of Chris and he made a comment about a cat appearing at the club and that he stepped back to pet it."" Prosecutor Liam Ewing QC asked what the significance of petting the cat was. The witness replied: ""Martin was going to his car first so there was no mistake of anyone being caught in the crossfire."" Jurors watched CCTV of Hughes moments after the shooting walking away from the scene texting on a mobile phone. Mr Ewing also asked the informer if Hughes understood something was to happen to Kok that night. He replied: ""I remember a comment being made about putting him [Kok] on a plate for the Roccies."" The witness claimed he had a meeting with his boss a month after the murder. He said: ""I was told it was an arrangement because the lad had access to Martin with a group called the Roccies, a Moroccan crime group, who are all over but more prominent in Amsterdam."" Hughes' boss then organised for him to be picked up as he hid in bushes while paramedics arrived at the scene. Gang member snared by elastic band DNA link The court heard Hughes was later put under surveillance by police and watched as he visited industrial units in Cambuslang and East Kilbride, South Lanarkshire as well as Chapelhall, North Lanarkshire. Mr Ewing told the jury in his closing speech that Â£700,000 was recovered from a machine inside one of the lock up garages. He added the lock-up in Chapelhall contained Â£40,000 of anti-surveillance equipment which is normally only found in the hands of government organisations. Police Scotland last month thanked law enforcement colleagues in the Netherlands and Italy for helping to bring the killer to justice. Det Chief Supt Stuart Houston, head of the organised crime unit, said: ""It has been well-documented that Hughes is a dangerous individual with a long association with organised crime in Scotland and beyond. ""He has wreaked havoc in our communities by trading illegal drugs to our communities and being involved in the importation of firearms which undoubtedly would have been used to harm or kill others."" A global investigation designed to dismantle Scotland's most sophisticated crime group has now resulted in 14 convictions. Clockwise from top left: Gerard Docherty, Steven McCardle, Francis Mulligan, David Sell, Barry O'Neill and Martyn Fitzsimmons. January 2018:A nine-man gang was jailedfor a total of 87 yearsafter a massive investigation into violence, drugs and firearms offences. They included cocaine dealer Mark Richardson and soldier turned gun-runner Martyn Fitzsimmons. The list of crimes included the ""merciless"" torture of a man over an unpaid drug debt and a huge arsenal of weapons found hidden in a car. Judge Lord Beckett said police had shown ""extraordinary ingenuity, courage and commitment"" to bring the gang to justice. April 2019:Daniel Lindsay and Darren Mulheron were both jailed for seven years after after officers seized Â£3.4m of heroin and cocaine as well as five Glock handguns. The pair from Castlemilk, Glasgow, pleaded guilty to being involved in serious organised crime.

"The Earl and Countess of Wessex leave for their seven-day trip on Friday The Grenada leg of the Earl and the Countess of Wessex's Caribbean tour has been postponed, a day before their week-long trip begins. The decision was made after talks with the island's government and governor general, Buckingham Palace said. Prince Edward and Sophie will still visit other islands on the tour to mark the Queen's Platinum Jubilee. It comes after the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were criticised for some parts of their recent Caribbean tour. A Buckingham Palace source said discussions were held with host nations to ensure the itinerary would meet the aims of the tour, which are to celebrate the islands and mark the Queen's 70-year reign. Within those discussions, Grenada - on the advice of Dame Cecile La Grenade, its governor general and the Queen's representative in the country - suggested a postponement. No further detail has yet been given about the reason for the delay. Prince Edward and Sophie hope to visit the island at a later date, the palace said. Their tour of three Caribbean nations - St Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Antigua and Barbuda - will begin on Friday. The plan must have seemed straightforward - send members of the Queen's family to her Realms (the countries where she is Head of State) to celebrate their culture and futures in this, her Platinum year. Yes - Princess Anne had a controversy-free trip to Australia and Papua New Guinea earlier this month and next month Prince Charles will travel to Canada. But the negative headlines which buffeted the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's Caribbean tour last month will have concentrated Palace minds. Although no reason has been given for the postponement of the Earl and Countess of Wessex's trip to Grenada, the key word in the brief statement announcing the change of plan must be ""consultation"". In Belize, the protest that derailed the Cambridges' trip on its very first day was reportedly because local people felt they had not been consulted on the plans for the visit. Last year, Barbados removed the Queen as its head of state. Last month, welcoming Catherine and William to his country, the Jamaican prime minister made clear his wish to do the same. Politicians in Grenada have called for a referendum on whether to become a republic. The country's reparations committee - which is calling for compensation from Britain as a result of the slave trade - says it requested an audience with the royal couple. So maybe the reason Grenada was dropped is that it was felt a visit may be deemed too political and a risk from a PR perspective. As the Cambridges found out, tours that once may have provided picturesque photo opportunities can now be viewed as a reminder of darker times involving colonialism and slavery. The palace will be hoping enough ""consultation"" has been done to ensure the Earl and Countess receive a warm welcome on the islands that remain on the itinerary. In March, part ofPrince William and Catherine's Caribbean tourwas axed after opposition from locals. The pair had been due to visit a cacao farm in the foothills of the Maya Mountains but it was removed from the couple's schedule following reports of a protest opposing the royal trip. Other moments on their tourwere criticised as public relations missteps- for example a Land Rover trip that was described as having a colonial appearance, and the greeting of local children through a wire fence. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge visited the Caribbean for their first overseas trip since the start of the pandemic Grenada gained independence from the UK in 1974 when Eric Gairy became the island's first prime minister. The National Democratic Congress, a liberal opposition party, has previously said it wouldput the question of whether the Queen should be head of state to a referendum,external. It also congratulated the prime minister of Barbados for having taken this step ahead ofthe island becoming a republic last year. Who's in the UK Royal Family and how does it work? The press secretary for the prime minister's office in Grenada said there was amutual agreement between the parties to postpone the visit,external. During the upcoming tour, Prince Edward will conduct an investiture on behalf of the Queen and the couple will attend a service to mark the Platinum Jubilee. The couple are due to meet local communities, Commonwealth Games athletes, craftspeople and women in leadership roles during their trip.

"Boris Johnson met Indian counterpart Narendra Modi in Delhi for the first time since last autumn Boris Johnson says India has agreed a ""massive push"" towards striking a post-Brexit trade deal with the UK. After meeting his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi in Delhi, the PM vowed to get an agreement ""done"" by Diwali in late October. Ahead of fresh negotiations next week, he said a deal could take UK-India trade to ""a whole new level"". Mr Johnson has previously signalled his target covers reaching an agreement in principle, not signing a full deal. Experts say any agreement with India this year is likely to be a precursor to a full agreement, with talks still at a relatively early stage. And Mr Johnson warned there would be ""tough asks"" from both sides. Whisky and visas could be in UK-India trade deal PM announces India deals as party debate continues Why India is not criticising Russia over Ukraine The meeting between the two leaders in India's capital came on the final day of Mr Johnson's two-day trip to the country, which has been delayed by Covid. Speaking after the meeting, Mr Johnson said India was ""an incredible rising power in Asia"" and deepening trade was a priority. In a signal that he could be flexible over an Indian demand for looser immigration rules for its nationals as part of a deal, Mr Johnson said Indian skills could help sectors such as IT. ""I'm not going to be dogmatic in refusing people with skill and talent in coming to the UK,"" he added. ""All I would say is we need to control it"". Britain is buying much more from India than it sells to India. That's because India tends to put up high trade barriers such as taxes on UK exports, known as tariffs. Foreign cars attract tariffs of up to 100%, for example. As a result, the UK currently sells less to India, with its vast population, than it does to Belgium. And it's getting worse: last year, the UK sold Â£4.7bn worth of goods to India and bought Â£8.4bn - that's the biggest gap between the UK and India's exports and imports that there's ever been. If you include services, the gap is even bigger. The top five goods imported from India were clothing, medicine, fabrics, industrial machinery and electrical goods, with metals and power generators going in the other direction. Read more Ahead of the meeting, Downing Street announced the UK planned to streamline its licensing rules for exporting military hardware to India. No 10 said the UK would support India to construct fighter jets, in an attempt to reduce the volume of weapons bought from Russia. There was a commitment to increase research into lowering the cost of ""green"" hydrogen power - part of the UK'srenewable energy plans. Prime Minister Boris Johnson visited Gujarat Biotechnology University on Thursday Mr Johnson also said he had raised the issue of India's relations with Russia during his meeting with Mr Modi. Along with other Western countries, the UK has been trying to persuade India to drop its neutral stance and join in condemning Moscow, which is its biggest arms supplier. Earlier this month, Indiacondemned killingsin the Ukrainian town of Bucha - the strongest statement it has made since Russia's invasion. But it stopped short of blaming Russia for the violence, and has not criticised Russia directly since its invasion in February. Mr Johnson said India had been ""very strong"" in its condemnation of the Bucha killings, and ""everybody understands and respects"" India's longstanding relationship with Russia. He said Mr Modi had ""intervened several times with Vladimir Putin to ask him what on earth he thinks he's doing"". ""What Indians want is peace, and the Russians out,"" he added.

"Boris Johnson has dismissed threats to his leadership, as the row over lockdown parties in Downing Street continues. Questions over the PM's position have been reignited this week after MPs backed a Commons inquiry into whether he has misled them. A senior Tory predicted it is ""a matter of when not if"" the PM now faces a no confidence vote from his own MPs. But Mr Johnson insisted he would still be in office this autumn. Asked during a trip to India whether he would still be in post by hisOctober targetfor a trade deal with the country, he replied: ""Yes"". And he sought to play down the partygate row, saying voters wanted the government to ""focus on the issues on which we were elected"". Analysis: Turbulent week puts PM's leadership back in frame What did Boris Johnson tell Parliament about parties? A timeline of the lockdown parties Mr Johnson is facing a future investigation by the Commons privileges committee, after MPs gave the go-ahead on Thursday. No 10 initially tried to delay a vote on approving the inquiry, but later backed down in the face of unease among Tory backbenchers. The committee will determine whether he misled MPs by telling them Covid rules were followed in No 10 - a charge regarded as a resigning matter under the ministerial rulebook. Last week, Mr Johnson, his wife Carrie and the Chancellor Rishi Sunak were fined by the police for breaching lockdown rules by attending a gathering to celebrate his birthday in June 2020. The PM is known to have attended at least two more of the 12 events being investigated by Met police, meaning he could be fined again. The fine has led to renewed calls for Mr Johnson to resign - and increasing speculation he could face a leadership challenge from within his party if May's local elections go badly for the Tories. This video can not be played WATCH: Ros Atkins Onâ¦ The PM and the Ministerial Code Tory peer and polling expert Lord Hayward said he expected Mr Johnson to eventually face a leadership challenge. He warned the various investigations into the PM's conduct could prove a ""death by a thousand cuts"" - and figures in the party wanted the question over his position to be resolved. ""We are moving to a position, despite what the prime minister says, [where] Tory MPs, Tory associations, Tory councillors, do not want an even more protracted process,"" he added. ""We've had it basically since before Christmas now, and I expect that were will be some form of contest for leadership at some stage."" Hindsight may have helped, but some Conservative MPs claim Thursday's chaotic events in Parliament could've been predicted. They point back to Tuesday when relatively few Tory backbenchers stood up to defend Boris Johnson after his statement about being fined. Something has shifted according to one critic of the prime minister, who claimed more and more of their colleagues were reluctant to back him in public. Boris Johnson still has plenty of supporters and many are giving him the benefit of the doubt until after the police investigation and Sue Gray report. The patience of some others is wearing thin, but there is no sign of any immediate co-ordinated move to challenge the PM's position. Nevertheless, Boris Johnson will return from his trip to India having lost the support of more of his MPs and facing a third investigation into his conduct. Earlier, Tory MP Tobias Ellwood said Conservative MPs were ""deeply troubled"" about the ""long-term damage to the party's brand"" caused by the partygate saga. Also predicting Mr Johnson would face a vote of no confidence, the defence committee chair accused No 10 of lacking ""discipline, focus and leadership"". Labour shadow minister Peter Kyle said Mr Johnson was a ""dead man walking"" who could no longer manage the country or his own party. But Northern Ireland Minister Conor Burns, a longtime ally of the PM, dismissed criticism from Conservative MPs, saying some of his colleagues had never supported the prime minister. ""If the prime minister stepped off Westminster Bridge and walked down the Thames on top of water they would say it was because he couldn't swim,"" he said. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon - who was herselfspoken to by policeafter being filmed breaching Scotland's face mask rules - said Mr Johnson was ""unfit for office"" and predicted he would be forced out. Liberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper said the Partygate issue was ""a huge distraction for Boris Johnson and the government, and this is why he should have resigned a long time ago."" The Commons privileges committee will determine whether the PM committed a ""contempt"" of Parliament by knowingly misleading MPs. It is made up of seven MPs - two from Labour (Yvonne Fovargue and Chris Bryant), one SNP (Allan Dorans) and four Conservatives (Andy Carter, Alberto Costa, Laura Farris and Sir Bernard Jenkin). Mr Bryant, who chairs the committee, has stepped back from the investigation as he had already commented publicly on the matter. It is understood that Labour is considering options within the party to replace him during the investigation. If the committee finds Mr Johnson did mislead Parliament, they can recommend a sanction which could include suspension from Parliament or ordering him to apologise.

"This video can not be played Watch Fury and Whyte weigh in before heavyweight bout at Wembley Tyson Fury v Dillian Whyte: WBC heavyweight title Venue:Wembley Stadium, LondonDate:Saturday, 23 April Coverage:Live text commentary on BBC Sport website and app from 20:00 BST WBC and Ring Magazine champion Tyson Fury weighed in 12lb lighter than his previous fight for Saturday's blockbuster heavyweight bout against Dillian Whyte at Wembley. Fury, 33, hit the scales at 18st 12lb, while challenger Whyte weighed in at 18st 1lb. The two Britons will fight in front of 94,000 fans - a post-war British record - with Fury making a second defence of the title he wonagainst Deontay Wilderin February 2020. The Sports Desk podcast: Kinahan, Fury and the state of boxing How 'throwback fighter' Whyte became a world title contender Steward on bond with heavyweight world champion Fury Fury's drop in weight from thefinal bout in the Wilder trilogyin October gives a slight indication as to how he may approach the fight. Against Wilder, Fury went toe-to-toe with the big-punching American. Weighing in lighter suggests Fury may revert back to fighting at range and using his quick feet and movement to outbox Whyte. Whyte, dressed in all black, took to the stage first and was dealt a chorus of boos by the Fury-friendly crowd at BoxPark in Wembley. The 34-year-old's self-imposed media silence before the fight left many wondering what shape he would come in, but Whyte looked in good condition and is 6lb heavier than when he knocked out Alexander Povetkin in March 2021. Fury then made his way to the scales. Wearing a white, blue and red tracksuit, the 'Gypsy King' paraded his WBC belt to a pumped-up crowd. The fighters have shared several social media spats over the years but, just as it was at Wednesday's media conference, there was a jovial atmosphere with no signs of any bad blood. They jokingly tickled each other, shook hands and then swapped baseball caps. Fury and Whyte almost resembled a double act and gave in the demands of an audience wanting an encore when they returned to the stage. They danced in unison to some music, throwing their hands in the air while bouncing on the spot. On Wednesday Fury and Whyte calmed down their respective entourages when matters got heated between the two teams. At the weigh-in, Team Fury and Team Whyte reconciled as the fighters' brothers embraced on stage. All media commitments and obligatory fight week events are done. The next time these two men lock eyes will be inside the ropes on Saturday evening.

The winner of Fury-Whyte will could then face Joshua or Usyk for an undisputed clash later this year. But Fury - who has won 31 bouts, with 22 knockouts, and drawn one - has suggested he will retire this weekend regardless of the outcome. Whyte is challenging for a world title for the first time, having won 28 bouts, with 19 stoppages. He has two losses on his record - against Joshua in 2015 and a knockout loss toAlexander Povetkinin August 2020, although heavenged his defeatby the Russian seven months later.

"UK retail sales dropped in March as the rising cost of living hit consumer spending, according to official data. Online sales fell sharply as people cut down on non-essential spending,the Office for National Statistics said,external. Fuel sales also dropped as people cut travel amid record petrol and diesel prices. However, overall retail sales were still above pre-Covid levels, the ONS said. Retail sales fell by an unexpected 1.4% in the month, and February's sales figures were also revised down. Darren Morgan, ONS director of economic statistics, said ""Online sales were hit particularly hard due to lower levels of discretionary spending. ""Fuel sales also fell substantially, with evidence suggesting some people reduced non-essential journeys, following record high petrol prices, while food sales continued to fall, dropping for the fifth consecutive month."" The cost of living crisis is being driven by surges in fuel, energy and food prices, with inflation running at 7% - its highest rate for 30 years. Energy and fuel prices had been rising even before Russia's invasion of Ukraine as economies started to recover from the coronavirus pandemic, and the conflict has pushed up prices further. What is the UK's inflation rate and why is the cost of living going up? How much is fuel duty and what will the cut on petrol save you? What is the energy cap and why are energy bills so high? Bethany Beckett, UK economist for Capital Economics, said inflation was set to keep rising and ""there's a real risk of an outright fall in consumer spending in the coming quarters"". The biggest contribution to the March retail sales slide came from the drop in online sales, which have been falling from pandemic highs after coronavirus restrictions eased. ""The sharp decline in sales in March suggests that households are already paring back spending to cope with higher costs for food and fuel,"" said Ms Beckett. ""That is only likely to worsen in the coming months as the cost of living crisis intensifies. After all, the March data predated April's huge 54% rise in utility bills which will have hit household budgets hard."" Separately, a survey by GfK suggested that UK consumer confidence in April dropped to its second-lowest level in 50 years due to people's weakening confidence in the economy and in their personal finances. Consumer confidence was at its lowest ebb since July 2008, which was during the severe worldwide economic crisis, the market research firm said. by Ramzan Karmali, BBC business correspondent The bigger-than-expected fall in retail sales last month was largely down to the current cost of living crisis - that's according to ONS officials. Online sales of non-essential items fell again, and the data suggests that record high petrol prices are having a major impact with a cut in non-essential journeys. More significantly perhaps is the fact food sales have been falling since last November, which is a sign that consumers are paring back their spending to cope with higher costs. Economists believe the situation will only become more acute as March's data came before April's 54% hike in gas and electricity bills. They also point to falling consumer confidence - the survey for this in April slumped to its lowest level in 14 years. Meanwhile, a survey of businesses suggested a slowdown in private sector growth in April. The UK's dominant services sector saw growth slow sharply,the S&P Global/CIPS composite Purchasing Managers' Index indicated.,external Although manufacturing growth picked up slightly after a five-month low in March, new manufacturing orders from abroad fell by the most since June 2020 as orders from Europe fell back. Firms also said export orders were hit by Brexit, recent congestion in UK ports and sanctions on Russia, the survey found. There was also a sharp rise in company insolvencies in March,according to official data,external. The number of firms going bust rose to 2,114 in March, more than double the number in March 2021, and a third higher than pre-pandemic figures. The Bank of England has been raising interest rates to try to cool inflation, and its key rate currently stands at 0.75%. Its governor, Andrew Bailey, said on Thursday that the Bank was walking a tight line between dealing with inflation and avoiding recession. Bank of England monetary policymaker Catherine Mann said that interest rates would probably have to go up ""a little bit"" further. Asked about the risk of so-called ""stagflation"", which is a combination of slow growth and high inflation, Ms Mann said ""in some senses, we could say we're already there"" because of the jump in energy prices and slowing retail sales. ""But I think that, you know, it's premature to kind of hearken back to the 1980s or the 1970s, in the US context in particular, and use that vocabulary,"" she said.

"Russia says it has destroyed six substations powering Ukrainian railways used to transport foreign weapons Ukraine's armed forces say Russia is targeting rail junctions to hit military supply routes At least five people in central Ukraine were killed in the attacks, Ukrainian officials say About 15,000 Russian troops have been killed since Russia invaded Ukraine, UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace says US Secretary of State Antony Blinken says Russia is trying to brutalise parts of Ukraine but failing in its war aims He was speaking after meeting President Zelensky in Kyiv on Sunday US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin, who also went to Kyiv, said the US wanted to see Russia militarily weakened Edited by Jude Sheerin Theo LeggettBBC International Business Correspondent Global military spending exceeded $2tn (Â£1.6tn) for the first time in 2021, with Russia's increased significantly, a new report says. It was the seventh year in which the total had risen, the report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute said. The rise in military spending is set to continue, as European countries build up their armed forces in response to Russiaâs invasion of Ukraine. The US spent more than $800bn on its military last year, more than double that of any other country. Russia increased its military spending by nearly 3%, helped by higher oil and gas revenues, as it built up its forces on the Ukrainian border. Finland and Sweden are gearing up to announce at the same time in May that they want to join Nato, Finnish and Swedish tabloids have reported. Both countries are militarily non-aligned but Russia's invasion of Ukraine has prompted increasing public support for joining the Western defensive alliance. Finnish newspaper Iltalehti says it believes the leaders of Finland and Sweden plan to meet in the week of 16 May and then announce that they will apply to join Nato. Finnish Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto declined to comment. The Swedish tabloid Aftonbladet, citing unnamed sources, also said it believed the two countries would make announcements that week, at the same time as each other. Russia has warned of a nuclear build-up in the Baltic should Finland and Sweden join Nato. Reality Check A MiG-29 on display at an air base in india India has been under pressure to help isolate Russia after its invasion of Ukraine. But it has long-standing defence ties to Moscow. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, visiting the US, has said that while India would like to be a âgood friendâ to Western countries, it needed to protect its interests and ensure its security. Data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri), shows that India is one of the worldâs largest buyers of weapons. And since 1992, about two-thirds of its military equipment has come from Russia. It has diversified its sources of weapons in recent years, buying more equipment from other countries. But if you look at the period from 2016 to 2021, Russia continued to be by far the largest supplier of weapons to India, accounting for twice as much as the next biggest supplier, France. Alina Kabaeva is a 38-year old Olympic gold medalist White House press secretary Jen Psaki denied at Monday's daily press briefing the US was deliberately holding off on sanctioning the woman believed to be Putin's girlfriend. ""We're continuing to review sanctions,"" Psaki said when asked why Russian politician and ex-gymnast Alina Kabaeva had not yet been targeted. ""No-one is safe from our sanctions,"" Psaki continued. ""We've already of course sanctioned President Putin, but also his daughter and his closest cronies, and we will continue to review more,"" she added. Calls have been rising for the US to sanction the 38-year old Olympic gold medalist, as the US has done to Putin's two adult daughters. Putin is known for being intensely private about his personal life, and has never acknowledged any romantic relationship with Russia's ""secret first lady"", as she has been dubbed in the Russian and foreign press. According to a Wall Street Journal report, US officials have withheld sanctions on Kabaeva due to concerns that Putin would view it as a personal attack. It would be viewed as ""so personal a blow to Mr Putin that it could further escalate tensions between Russia and the US"", the Journal wrote. An railway electricity substation near Lviv was damaged in a Russian strike aimed at halting the supply of foreign weapons If you're just joining us, here's a round-up of the latest events in Ukraine.  Lavrov also acknowledged there's a possibility of the conflict escalating to nuclear weapons, though he also sounded a hopeful note about the prospects of a peace accord. Speaking to the Russian First Channel on Monday, he said Moscow wanted to avoid ""artificially"" elevated risks of such a conflict. ""This is our key position on which we base everything. The risks now are considerable,"" Lavrov said. ""I would not want to elevate those risks artificially. Many would like that. The danger is serious, real, And we must not underestimate it."" Lavrov also accused President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine of ""pretending"" to negotiate, calling him ""a good actorâ. ""If you watch attentively and read attentively what he says, you'll find a thousand contradictions,"" Russiaâs top diplomat said. The foreign minister said last week that Moscow was committed to avoiding a nuclear war. On Monday, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted that Lavrovâs latest comments were an indication Russia had lost its ""last hope to scare the world off supporting Ukraineâ. ""Thus the talk of a ârealâ danger of WWIII. This only means Moscow senses defeat in Ukraine,"" he tweeted. Days after the invasion began back on 24 February, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his nuclear forces to be on alert. The US and its Nato allies have said they do not want direct military intervention in Ukraine, in order to avoid the risks of a Third World War. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has said deliveries of Western weaponry to Ukraine mean that the Nato alliance is ""in essence engaged in war with Russiaâ. In an interview aired on Monday, he said: ""These weapons will be a legitimate target for Russiaâs military acting within the context of the special operation.â Lavrov also told state television: ""Nato, in essence, is engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy. War means war."" In his nightly video address to the nation, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says that Ukraine's victory is inevitable, but it is impossible to predict when the war will conclude. ""Many cities and communities are still under the temporary control of the Russian army,"" he says in his address. ""But I have no doubt that it is only a matter of time before we liberate our land."" Earlier in his address, he marked the fact that the invasion, which began on 24 February, has just surpassed the three-month mark. Zelensky goes on to say that there is ""no simple answer"" to the question of when Ukraine will defeat the Russians, adding that victory - and peace - will come more quickly if every Ukrainian fights. ""When we gain a victory, everyone will feel it. When peace comes, everyone will see it. ""But for this to happen - and happen faster - we need to think not about when and what it will be. We must think every day about how to make the stay of the occupiers on our land even more unbearable."" ""For Russia to seek peace, every Ukrainian must still fight,"" he continues. ""They must defend freedom. Because every day of struggle now adds years of peaceful life after this war. After our victory."" This ambulance was one of 20 donated earlier this month to the war-torn country The UK is donating 22 new ambulances and medical equipment to Ukraine following a request from the government there, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has announced. It comes just weeks after a shipment of 20 ambulances was sent to the country, as it battles against the Russian invasion. Medical aid charity UK-Med, which works on the front line of disasters around the world, has been given Â£300,000 of funding to train Ukrainian doctors, nurses and paramedics in dealing with mass casualties. The charity has also been given Â£300,000 of medicines and other pharmaceutical supplies to bring to Ukrainian medical staff. More than 40 fire engines have already arrived in Ukraine from the UK, after the nation saw more than 100 of its fire stations and 250 fire engines destroyed in the war. Steve RosenbergRussia editor, reporting from Bryansk Plumes of smoke were captured rising into the sky from the oil depot in Bryansk on a video on social media The city of Bryansk is a hundred miles from Russiaâs border
with Ukraine. But today it looked like it was on the front line. Plumes of
thick black smoke dominated the skyline - the consequence of fires overnight.
First one fuel depot erupting in flames, and then another. The cause? Well, thereâs been no official explanation - there
is, however, much speculation. Was this the result of a Ukrainian strike to
disrupt logistics for Russiaâs military offensive? Was it sabotage by Russian
opponents of the Kremlinâs so-called special military operation? Neither Moscow
nor Kyiv is saying. Whatever the cause, the fires have sparked concern amongst
the Russian public. Here are some of the things people told me on the streets
of Bryansk: âThis never happened before. At 3am we heard explosions.
Weâre amazed.â âI donât know what this is. Is it war here? Well, I suppose
weâre on the front line. I wonder if Ukraine did this..?â We have seen something similar in Belgorod, earlier this
month. Another blaze at another Russian fuel depot near the border. Russia
claimed Ukrainian helicopter gunships had opened fire. Kyiv wouldnât confirm
it. But one thing is clear. Despite President Putinâs claims
that he sent his troops into Ukraine to bring Russians security, there is
little sign of that. Electronic equipment which could be used to intercept communications and spy on Ukrainians is the latest category of products to be banned by the UK for export to Russia. The Department for International Trade also announced the UK would remove tariffs and quotes on products from Ukraine, responding to a request from President Volodymyr Zelensky to support the country's economy as it defends itself from invasion. The decision would affect key Ukrainian exports such as barley, honey, tinned tomatoes and poultry, the UK said. Tariffs will be lifted for 12 months initially, but could be extended. As well as equipment used to intercept and monitor communications, the UK has previously banned the export of luxury goods, aviation and space equipment, oil refining items and advanced technologies such as quantum computing. Jonathan BealeDefence correspondent, reporting from Donbas Lieutenant Denys Gordeev is used to war, but not like this. ""It's become much harder,"" he says. ""We have bomb attacks, rocket attacks every day, all the time, every hour."" Though he has spent eight years battling Russian-backed separatists in the Donbas, now he and his men are facing the full might of the Russian army. After its retreat from Kyiv three weeks ago, Russia has refocused its military efforts in Eastern Ukraine - with its goal of taking the whole of the Donbas region. It has redeployed many of its units to the east. Western officials estimate that Russia now has about 76 Battalion Tactical Groups in the region - each of which has about 800 men. They also say there's some evidence Russia's been addressing some of its early mistakes, helped by the fact they're now fighting on fewer fronts, and under a unified command. The result is that Ukrainian forces are struggling to hold a 300-mile front in the Donbas. They've already lost ground to the Russians and are likely to lose more in the days ahead. Russian forces have been conducting probing attacks to find weak points in Ukraine's defences. For now the invading army is mostly using its artillery and rockets to grind down Ukraine's defences. Some military analysts expect a major assault is still to come. And Ukrainian forces, including Lt Gordeev and his unit, appear to be holding the line, although Western experts say they are already outnumbered three to one. Read the full report here. Now some news from Kherson, the only major city that Russian forces have taken and continued to occupy. Its Ukrainian mayor, Ihor Kolykhayev, has reported on Facebook that Russian armed men took control of the city council building on Monday. Although Kherson has been under Russian occupation since early March, the city council had still been functioning under Ukrainian control. Kolykhayev said the Russian military took away the keys to the building and exchanged the security guards for guards of their own. He said he left the building at 19.45 local time. Pravda, a Ukrainian news outlet, reported that from 26 April, Kherson city council would not be functioning. It added that the mayor and employees of the city council were given the chance to go home. Adam EastonWarsaw Correspondent Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki has said his government has sent tanks to Ukraine. During an interview with private broadcaster Polsat News, Morawiecki was asked if Poland has sent, or will send, tanks to Ukraine. He replied ""yes"", without giving further details. He said he would announce more information âin due courseâ but for the time being he wouldn't reveal how many tanks have been supplied for security reasons. For several weeks now, itâs been rumoured that Poland has been supplying Ukraine with Soviet-era T-72 tanks. The Ministry of Defence had refused to comment on the rumours. Morawiecki said that the matter of Poland supplying Ukraine with Soviet-era MiG-29 fighter jets is now âclosedâ. In March, Poland said it was ready to deploy the jets to the US Ramstein Air Base in Germany and put them at the disposal of the US military, but Washington rejected the offer. âThere is no such necessity, there are no such demands, no such requests,â he said, when asked if sending planes to Ukraine was still being considered. Several explosions have hit the state security ministry in the breakaway Moldovan region of Transnistria, the interior ministry said on its Telegram channel. The ministry said the building appeared to have been hit with rocket-propelled grenades, but it said no one was injured. It comes days after a Russian general suggested Moscow wanted totake full control of southern Ukraine, giving Russia access to the separatist region of Moldova which it supports. He said there was ""oppression of the Russian-speaking population"" in Transnistria, a claim which had also been made - without evidence - to justify the invasion of Ukraine. Ukraine's defence ministry saidthe incident was a ""planned provocation"" by Russia itself to instil ""panic and anti-Ukrainian sentiment"",external. A small Russian-speaking breakaway region, Transnistria borders Ukraine from the west. It claimed independence after the fall of the Soviet Union in a bloody conflict, but is not recognised internationally and officially remains part of Moldova. A senior Russian diplomat has said a ceasefire is not a good option at the moment, because it will give Ukrainian forces the chance to ""regroup and to stage more provocations"". Earlier today, Russia announced that it would be holding a ceasefire around the steelworks in the besieged city of Mariupol from 14:00 local time (11:00 GMT), to allow civilians to leave. But Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said no agreement had been reached and called for written security guarantees. Russia's first deputy permanent representative to the UN, Dmitry Polyanskiy, said Ukraine had claimed that there were some civilians in the Azovstal steel plant, where the last Ukrainian fighters in the city are holed up, but Ukrainian forces ""did not let them go"". He went on to say that Russia had not attacked residential areas in Odesa, Ukraine's Black Sea port city, over the weekend. On Saturday, Ukraine said that two missiles struck a military facility and two residential buildings in the city. But Polyanskiy said the residential buildings were hit by Ukraine air defences. He went on to reject the comments made by US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, who said Russia had failed to achieve its aims in the invasion. Polyanskiy said: ""I don't think we failed, frankly."" He added that Russia is conducting its ""military operation"" and it has ""its own aims"" and ""its own strategies"". Nikita, Oleksandr and Vira have been living in a succession of temporary lodgings as they wait for news of a visa A disabled teenaged refugee from Ukraine and his grandparents have been stuck in Paris for more than six weeks as they wait for their UK visa application to be processed. Kateryna Karpenko persuaded her nephew Nikita Shepel, and her parents Oleksandr and Vira, to flee Russian shelling and apply to come to join her in the UK, where she has lived for almost 10 years. But amid complaints that the UK Home Office has conducted a chaotic and overly-bureaucratic response to the Ukrainian refugee crisis, the estimated five working day wait for a visa has turned into more than a month in limbo, costing them thousands of pounds in accommodation. ""They had to go through a lot, fleeing Ukraine, and they have no idea what's happening with our home, our family, our lives,"" says Kateryna. A UK government spokesman said changes the Home Office has made to the system, including simpler forms and increase staff numbers, are working. Read more  US President Joe Biden has named the veteran diplomat Bridget Brink as the new US ambassador to Ukraine. Earlier today, the White House announced that Brink would be moving to fill ""a crucial position"", which has been vacant for the past three years. Washington said Brink's appointment came at a time when the US was ramping up its support for Ukraine, amid Russia's invasion. The new ambassador is currently serving as the US ambassador to Slovakia and has been a diplomat for 25 years. The White House added that Brink's ""decades of
experience make her uniquely suited for this moment in Ukraineâs
history"". A firefighter surveys the damage at an electricity substation powering the railway near Lviv We've been bringing you updates on the reports of attacks on railway infrastructure in Ukraine, which Ukrainian officials say killed five people. Earlier, Ukraine said Russia was trying to disrupt supply lines for military equipment from foreign countries. Now Russia has confirmed that was the purpose of the attacks, according to Reuters. The news agency is citing a statement from the Russian defence ministry, saying its missiles destroyed six facilities powering the railways that were used to supply Ukrainian forces with weapons from abroad. Ukrainian officials said five railway stations in the centre and west of the country came under attack within an hour this morning. An electricity substation powering overhead lines in Krasne, near Lviv, was also hit in a missile strike. Ukraine's defence minister has thanked the US for their military assistance - describing the relationship between the two nation's as as a ""true brotherhood"". Oleksii Reznikov's comments on Twitter follow the visit to Kyiv on Sunday by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. Mr Reznikov said the support given by the Biden administration is ""not measured in money, but in the saved lives of Ukrainians"". During the visit, it was announced that US diplomats will begin returning to Ukraine and the Washington will provide Ukraine with a further $700m in military aid. Mr Reznikov also shared a video where he can be seen shaking hands and embracing Austin, accompanied by the caption: ""This is more than partnership of state officials - this is true brotherhood.""

"Russia says it has destroyed six substations powering Ukrainian railways used to transport foreign weapons Ukraine's armed forces say Russia is targeting rail junctions to hit military supply routes At least five people in central Ukraine were killed in the attacks, Ukrainian officials say About 15,000 Russian troops have been killed since Russia invaded Ukraine, UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace says US Secretary of State Antony Blinken says Russia is trying to brutalise parts of Ukraine but failing in its war aims He was speaking after meeting President Zelensky in Kyiv on Sunday US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin, who also went to Kyiv, said the US wanted to see Russia militarily weakened Edited by Jude Sheerin Theo LeggettBBC International Business Correspondent Global military spending exceeded $2tn (Â£1.6tn) for the first time in 2021, with Russia's increased significantly, a new report says. It was the seventh year in which the total had risen, the report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute said. The rise in military spending is set to continue, as European countries build up their armed forces in response to Russiaâs invasion of Ukraine. The US spent more than $800bn on its military last year, more than double that of any other country. Russia increased its military spending by nearly 3%, helped by higher oil and gas revenues, as it built up its forces on the Ukrainian border. Finland and Sweden are gearing up to announce at the same time in May that they want to join Nato, Finnish and Swedish tabloids have reported. Both countries are militarily non-aligned but Russia's invasion of Ukraine has prompted increasing public support for joining the Western defensive alliance. Finnish newspaper Iltalehti says it believes the leaders of Finland and Sweden plan to meet in the week of 16 May and then announce that they will apply to join Nato. Finnish Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto declined to comment. The Swedish tabloid Aftonbladet, citing unnamed sources, also said it believed the two countries would make announcements that week, at the same time as each other. Russia has warned of a nuclear build-up in the Baltic should Finland and Sweden join Nato. Reality Check A MiG-29 on display at an air base in india India has been under pressure to help isolate Russia after its invasion of Ukraine. But it has long-standing defence ties to Moscow. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, visiting the US, has said that while India would like to be a âgood friendâ to Western countries, it needed to protect its interests and ensure its security. Data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri), shows that India is one of the worldâs largest buyers of weapons. And since 1992, about two-thirds of its military equipment has come from Russia. It has diversified its sources of weapons in recent years, buying more equipment from other countries. But if you look at the period from 2016 to 2021, Russia continued to be by far the largest supplier of weapons to India, accounting for twice as much as the next biggest supplier, France.

Ukraine's defence minister has thanked the US for their military assistance - describing the relationship between the two nation's as as a ""true brotherhood"". Oleksii Reznikov's comments on Twitter follow the visit to Kyiv on Sunday by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. Mr Reznikov said the support given by the Biden administration is ""not measured in money, but in the saved lives of Ukrainians"". During the visit, it was announced that US diplomats will begin returning to Ukraine and the Washington will provide Ukraine with a further $700m in military aid. Mr Reznikov also shared a video where he can be seen shaking hands and embracing Austin, accompanied by the caption: ""This is more than partnership of state officials - this is true brotherhood.""

"Boris Johnson met Indian counterpart Narendra Modi in Delhi for the first time since last autumn Boris Johnson says India has agreed a ""massive push"" towards striking a post-Brexit trade deal with the UK. After meeting his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi in Delhi, the PM vowed to get an agreement ""done"" by Diwali in late October. Ahead of fresh negotiations next week, he said a deal could take UK-India trade to ""a whole new level"". Mr Johnson has previously signalled his target covers reaching an agreement in principle, not signing a full deal. Experts say any agreement with India this year is likely to be a precursor to a full agreement, with talks still at a relatively early stage. And Mr Johnson warned there would be ""tough asks"" from both sides. Whisky and visas could be in UK-India trade deal PM announces India deals as party debate continues Why India is not criticising Russia over Ukraine The meeting between the two leaders in India's capital came on the final day of Mr Johnson's two-day trip to the country, which has been delayed by Covid. Speaking after the meeting, Mr Johnson said India was ""an incredible rising power in Asia"" and deepening trade was a priority. In a signal that he could be flexible over an Indian demand for looser immigration rules for its nationals as part of a deal, Mr Johnson said Indian skills could help sectors such as IT. ""I'm not going to be dogmatic in refusing people with skill and talent in coming to the UK,"" he added. ""All I would say is we need to control it"". Britain is buying much more from India than it sells to India. That's because India tends to put up high trade barriers such as taxes on UK exports, known as tariffs. Foreign cars attract tariffs of up to 100%, for example. As a result, the UK currently sells less to India, with its vast population, than it does to Belgium. And it's getting worse: last year, the UK sold Â£4.7bn worth of goods to India and bought Â£8.4bn - that's the biggest gap between the UK and India's exports and imports that there's ever been. If you include services, the gap is even bigger. The top five goods imported from India were clothing, medicine, fabrics, industrial machinery and electrical goods, with metals and power generators going in the other direction. Read more Ahead of the meeting, Downing Street announced the UK planned to streamline its licensing rules for exporting military hardware to India. No 10 said the UK would support India to construct fighter jets, in an attempt to reduce the volume of weapons bought from Russia. There was a commitment to increase research into lowering the cost of ""green"" hydrogen power - part of the UK'srenewable energy plans. Prime Minister Boris Johnson visited Gujarat Biotechnology University on Thursday Mr Johnson also said he had raised the issue of India's relations with Russia during his meeting with Mr Modi. Along with other Western countries, the UK has been trying to persuade India to drop its neutral stance and join in condemning Moscow, which is its biggest arms supplier. Earlier this month, Indiacondemned killingsin the Ukrainian town of Bucha - the strongest statement it has made since Russia's invasion. But it stopped short of blaming Russia for the violence, and has not criticised Russia directly since its invasion in February. Mr Johnson said India had been ""very strong"" in its condemnation of the Bucha killings, and ""everybody understands and respects"" India's longstanding relationship with Russia. He said Mr Modi had ""intervened several times with Vladimir Putin to ask him what on earth he thinks he's doing"". ""What Indians want is peace, and the Russians out,"" he added.

"The Co-op supermarket has announced plans to ditch use-by dates on its own-brand yoghurt in a bid to reduce food waste. The company said the label on packets and containers will instead be replaced by a best-before date as guidance. Six million people in the UK eat a yoghurt daily, the supermarket said. But research from recycling charity Wrap shows half of yoghurts are binned unopened, mainly because they were not eaten before the recommended date. The charity's research has also suggested 70% of food waste happens in homes. Use-by labels are the dates until which perishable food can be cooked and consumed safely. Best-before guidance, meanwhile, is for when the product should be consumed to get the best quality, taste and texture. The Food Standards Agencysays it is up to manufacturers to decide,externalwhether to apply a use-by or best-before date on their products. It will depend on factors such as how the food is made and how risky it is, it said. In January, fellow supermarket Morrisonsgot rid of use by dates on its own-brand milk,in a move it said was aimed at preventing millions of pints being poured down the sink. Nick Cornwell, head of food technical at the Co-op, said yoghurt can be safe if stored unopened in a fridge after the date mark, as the acidity of the dairy product acts as a natural defence for food safety. He explained the supermarket were encouraging shoppers to ""use their judgment"" if their yoghurt has passed its best-before date, adding the move was designed to help reduce food waste. For foods with a best before date, the FSA urges people to use their senses to check whether it is appropriate to eat. It suggests smelling some dairy products with a best before date to see if they have soured. Want to cut food waste? There's an app for that Mr Cornwell said the move would hopefully help customers to make minor changes which can ""collectively make a big impact and combat unnecessary food waste"". ""Controlling food waste is not only beneficial for managing household budgets, it also has an environmental benefit and will ultimately help reduce carbon emissions,"" he added. Mr Cornwell also called on other retailers and food brands to review their own pack guidance practices and also make the yoghurt labelling switch. This video can not be played Five tricks for longer food freshness Catherine David from Wrap said the charity was ""delighted"" at the change, as the date listed on yoghurt packets is a ""fundamental reason that it is wasted at home"". ""Wasting food feeds climate change and costs money,"" she said. ""Applying a best before date helps give people the confidence to use their judgment to eat beyond a best-before date and use more of the yogurt they buy - protecting the planet and their pockets.""

"Boris Johnson has dismissed threats to his leadership, as the row over lockdown parties in Downing Street continues. Questions over the PM's position have been reignited this week after MPs backed a Commons inquiry into whether he has misled them. A senior Tory predicted it is ""a matter of when not if"" the PM now faces a no confidence vote from his own MPs. But Mr Johnson insisted he would still be in office this autumn. Asked during a trip to India whether he would still be in post by hisOctober targetfor a trade deal with the country, he replied: ""Yes"". And he sought to play down the partygate row, saying voters wanted the government to ""focus on the issues on which we were elected"". Analysis: Turbulent week puts PM's leadership back in frame What did Boris Johnson tell Parliament about parties? A timeline of the lockdown parties Mr Johnson is facing a future investigation by the Commons privileges committee, after MPs gave the go-ahead on Thursday. No 10 initially tried to delay a vote on approving the inquiry, but later backed down in the face of unease among Tory backbenchers. The committee will determine whether he misled MPs by telling them Covid rules were followed in No 10 - a charge regarded as a resigning matter under the ministerial rulebook. Last week, Mr Johnson, his wife Carrie and the Chancellor Rishi Sunak were fined by the police for breaching lockdown rules by attending a gathering to celebrate his birthday in June 2020. The PM is known to have attended at least two more of the 12 events being investigated by Met police, meaning he could be fined again. The fine has led to renewed calls for Mr Johnson to resign - and increasing speculation he could face a leadership challenge from within his party if May's local elections go badly for the Tories. This video can not be played WATCH: Ros Atkins Onâ¦ The PM and the Ministerial Code Tory peer and polling expert Lord Hayward said he expected Mr Johnson to eventually face a leadership challenge. He warned the various investigations into the PM's conduct could prove a ""death by a thousand cuts"" - and figures in the party wanted the question over his position to be resolved. ""We are moving to a position, despite what the prime minister says, [where] Tory MPs, Tory associations, Tory councillors, do not want an even more protracted process,"" he added. ""We've had it basically since before Christmas now, and I expect that were will be some form of contest for leadership at some stage."" Hindsight may have helped, but some Conservative MPs claim Thursday's chaotic events in Parliament could've been predicted. They point back to Tuesday when relatively few Tory backbenchers stood up to defend Boris Johnson after his statement about being fined. Something has shifted according to one critic of the prime minister, who claimed more and more of their colleagues were reluctant to back him in public. Boris Johnson still has plenty of supporters and many are giving him the benefit of the doubt until after the police investigation and Sue Gray report. The patience of some others is wearing thin, but there is no sign of any immediate co-ordinated move to challenge the PM's position. Nevertheless, Boris Johnson will return from his trip to India having lost the support of more of his MPs and facing a third investigation into his conduct. Earlier, Tory MP Tobias Ellwood said Conservative MPs were ""deeply troubled"" about the ""long-term damage to the party's brand"" caused by the partygate saga. Also predicting Mr Johnson would face a vote of no confidence, the defence committee chair accused No 10 of lacking ""discipline, focus and leadership"". Labour shadow minister Peter Kyle said Mr Johnson was a ""dead man walking"" who could no longer manage the country or his own party. But Northern Ireland Minister Conor Burns, a longtime ally of the PM, dismissed criticism from Conservative MPs, saying some of his colleagues had never supported the prime minister. ""If the prime minister stepped off Westminster Bridge and walked down the Thames on top of water they would say it was because he couldn't swim,"" he said. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon - who was herselfspoken to by policeafter being filmed breaching Scotland's face mask rules - said Mr Johnson was ""unfit for office"" and predicted he would be forced out. Liberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper said the Partygate issue was ""a huge distraction for Boris Johnson and the government, and this is why he should have resigned a long time ago."" The Commons privileges committee will determine whether the PM committed a ""contempt"" of Parliament by knowingly misleading MPs. It is made up of seven MPs - two from Labour (Yvonne Fovargue and Chris Bryant), one SNP (Allan Dorans) and four Conservatives (Andy Carter, Alberto Costa, Laura Farris and Sir Bernard Jenkin). Mr Bryant, who chairs the committee, has stepped back from the investigation as he had already commented publicly on the matter. It is understood that Labour is considering options within the party to replace him during the investigation. If the committee finds Mr Johnson did mislead Parliament, they can recommend a sanction which could include suspension from Parliament or ordering him to apologise. The whole House of Commons would then have to sign off on any punishment.

"Five-year-old Logan Mwangi was described as a ""really sweet, happy-go-lucky child"" by a neighbour A man who murdered his five-year-old stepson was a known racist with a string of previous convictions. John Colewas found guilty of the murder of Logan Mwangi,alongside the little boy's mother Angharad Williamson and a 14-year-old boy, on Thursday. Cole, 40, and Williamson, 31, claimed they were excellent parents. But witnesses painted a different picture. During and after the trial, the couple's lies have unravelled to reveal a dark past. Mum, stepdad and teen guilty of murder of boy, 5 How CCTV helped police catch Logan's killers Lies told by three murderers exposed by CCTV Logan's body was found in the River Ogmore, close to his home in Sarn, Bridgend county, in July 2021. He died after suffering a ""brutal and sustained"" attack at home, leaving him with ""catastrophic"" injuries, which experts also said could have only been caused by a ""brutal and sustained assault"". Following the trial, BBC Wales can reveal the racist past of the five-year-old's stepfather and how his mother went from private schoolgirl to murdering her own child. This video can not be played Police found Logan Mwangi's body in a river near his home - he was wearing a pair of dinosaur pyjama bottoms and a Spider-Man top Martial arts fan Cole, who grew up in Rugby, Warwickshire, told people he had served in the SAS. But during his 20s he was associated with the National Front, a fascist political party, and was known to be ""very racist"". He had claimed to have put his racist past behind him but those who knew him, including friend Jodie Symmonds, said he used racial slurs against his mixed race stepson. Williamson and Cole were both named - but why is the 14-year-old's identity being protected? It is throughsection 45 of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act,external, which means no victim, witness or defendant under 18 can be named in court proceedings. This order is the ""default position with regards to the welfare of the child, even if it is a serious crime"", said Cardiff University law lecturer Dr Julie Doughty. She points to rare occasions it has been challenged by the press and lifted by judges  - such as the case of 16-year-old schoolboy Will Cornick, from Leeds,who admitted murdering teacherAnn Maguire. It has also been done recently in a case in Cardiff - with the judge lifting restrictions on the identity of Dionne Timms-Williams,who was 16 when she took partin a homophobic murder - after she was convicted. ""When he reaches 18, the order will expire and if the media are still interested, he can be identified,"" Dr Doughty added. However, there are exceptions. For example,the murderers of James Bulgerhave lifelong anonymity. Robert Thompson and Jon Venables were 10 when they tortured and killed the toddler in Liverpool and while they were named at the time, Dr Doughty said a judge deemed they would need new identities on release because it was ""such an extreme case and will never be forgotten"". Friends said Cole told them he did not like Logan and witnessed him making the young boy do press-ups to teach him a lesson, stand in the naughty corner for extensive periods of time and make him watch others eat takeaway while he was only given cereal. He has a string of previous convictions, including robbery, blackmail, witness intimidation and three previous offences of perverting the course of justice, according to the PA news agency. He was said to have encouraged the 14-year-old boy - who was also found guilty of Logan's murder, but cannot be named for legal reasons - to assault Logan using martial arts manoeuvres he had learned. Angharad Williamson and John Cole had claimed to be excellent parents Williamson's claims of being a loving mother with the ""perfect little family"" were shattered as she was found guilty of murdering her own child. The daughter of a stockbroker, she grew up in Essex with a twin brother and younger brother and attended a fee-paying primary school, according to the PA news agency. But before she had even met Cole, she had already turned to a life of dishonesty and violence. She was charged with two counts of theft after making unauthorised payments on her mother's credit card. On another occasion, with a boyfriend, she stole her mother's car and was punished in court with a community order and unpaid work. This video can not be played Logan Mwangi's dad said the world was colder and darker without his son Shortly after that, Williamson met Benjamin Mwangi and by June 2015 the couple were expecting a child. Logan was born in March 2016, but his parents' relationship soon failed. Later that year she got together with Jordan Hunt, a soldier, and they married in August 2017. The relationship turned violent and by January 2019 the marriage was over. Months later, Williamson moved with Logan to a council flat in Bridgend and soon met John Cole in a local pub. This video can not be played Tim Thomas said one man had donated a bench Despite Cole being in a relationship with someone else, Williamson fell pregnant. During the trial, Williamson claimed the relationship changed when Logan's father resumed contact with his son. Cole is said to have stopped Logan seeing his father - jealously believing Ben Mwangi was having an affair with Williamson. After Logan's death, she told detectives she was scared of Cole because he had claimed to have served in the SAS. The five-year-old's body was found in the River Ogmore Cole also said he was subject to an indeterminate sentence ofImprisonment for Public Protection (IPP),external- designed to protect the public from serious offenders whose crimes did not merit a life sentence - and could ""find her"" wherever she went. Williamson was described as loud, with a tendency to use foul language and switch moods easily. Her mother Clare, who sat for most of the trial in the public gallery and for a time was seen reading Richard Osman's The Thursday Murder Club, said her daughter had been ""dramatic"" since she was a child. Throughout most of the trial, Williamson sobbed from the dock and repeatedly called Cole a ""liar"", imploring him to ""tell the truth"" while giving evidence. It was revealed she was an avid watcher of YouTube videos on blackhead removal and Dr Pimple Popper and had watched more than 300 clips between October 2019 and August 2021. As a mother, to many she appeared loving, but with a tendency to be ""overbearing"" or ""overprotective"". Others said they observed her shouting at her children, and at times seemed ambivalent to Cole's harsh treatment of Logan. Angharad Williamson, and her partner, John Cole, were found guilty of Logan's murder at Cardiff Crown Court Speaking to Radio Wales Breakfast, child protection expert Jim Gamble, who is chief executive of the INEQE child safeguarding organisation, said he was ""sickened listening to the evidence and delighted that people have been held to account"". But he added: ""That won't bring Logan back."" ""Everyone will be looking at their children this morning, thinking how could any human being, let alone a mother and stepfather, do this to a child? ""I think we need to be really careful that we don't knee-jerk to demonize social care, police, educators, health professional that may have been involved. ""We're talking about extremely manipulative parents - they disguise their compliance. ""I am confident that everybody involved will simply want these lessons to be learned. ""They're doing a very difficult job and they'll be sick to their stomachs about this.""

"The symbol of Russia's ""special military operation"" in Ukraine crops up all over Moscow There are no shells exploding in Moscow. There are no foreign forces encircling the city. What Muscovites are experiencing now is nothing compared to the horrors in Ukraine. At first glance life here even looks normal. As usual, Moscow's Garden Ring is packed with traffic. Crowds are streaming from the metro station opposite me. In reality, though, little here could be described as normal. Normality ended on 24 February when Vladimir Putin ordered his troops into Ukraine for his ""Special Military Operation"". I have experienced Communist Russia. I have lived through post-Soviet Russia. Now the world's largest country has metamorphosed again. Let me take you on a tour of ""Special Military Operation Russia"". I get in the car to drive to the supermarket. By force of habit, I switch on the radio. It's tuned to 91.2 FM - once the home of Radio Echo of Moscow. Echo was my favourite Russian radio station - a reliable source of news and information. But in recent weeks all independent Russian news outlets have either been blocked or shut down.  Broadcasting now on 91.2 FM is state-run Radio Sputnik, which backs the Russian offensive in Ukraine. Driving along the Garden Ring, I pass a theatre which has erected on its faÃ§ade a giant Latin letter Z - the symbol of Russia's military operation. There's another Z outside the headquarters of Russian Railways. I overtake a lorry that has a Z sticker on the side. In recent weeks Zs have been graffitied on the front doors of Kremlin critics. At the shopping mall, business is far from booming. Many of the shops - international brands - have shut down. Since Russian forces attacked Ukraine, hundreds of foreign companies have suspended operations in Russia. In the supermarket, the shelves are full. Last month's sugar shortage in Russia - the result of panic buying - appears to have been resolved. But the range of products seems smaller than before. And over the last two months prices have shot up. Outside the shopping centre, I get chatting to Nadezhda, a doctor. ""Prices are so high, it's impossible to survive now on my salary,"" Nadezhda tells me. Supermarkets are full - with no sign of the panic that set in days after Russian troops moved into Ukraine ""But the hardest thing of all is living in a society that doesn't want to know the truth about events in Ukraine. People are too busy worrying about their mortgage payments, paying off their debts. They're not interested in what's going on around them. But I think that what's happening in Ukraine is terrible. I'm ashamed to be Russian."" I drive to the Moscow engineering institute where, 30 years ago, I used to teach English. Back in the early 1990s, after the fall of communism, my students here were full of hope that Russia and the West would forge a lasting friendship and partnership; that the future would be peaceful and prosperous. That didn't work out. ""We'll overcome all our difficulties. After sunset always comes the dawn,"" says Denis, a student, outside the institute. ""But I support our troops. They are our soldiers. I am obliged to support my country come what may."" My final destination is the giant war museum that celebrates the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany in World War Two - a glorious victory, achieved at enormous human cost. More than 27 million Soviet citizens were killed in what is known here as the Great Patriotic War. What I find disturbing is how the ""Special Military Operation"" has found a place in this museum, how it's being honoured here. On the museum's website, the spelling of the word ""museum"" has been altered to feature the letter Z. In the museum shop you can buy Z mugs and badges declaring ""Putin is My PreZident"". The Z has replaced the S in the word president in the badges being sold in the WWII museum shop And the museum is currently hosting an exhibition about Nazis in Ukraine. That helps to cement the Kremlin's bogus claim that the Russian army is liberating Ukraine from Nazism. This is ""Special Military Operation Russia"" - a parallel universe, Orwellian, where invasion is liberation, where aggression is self-defence and where critics are traitors. It feels like the Russia I have known for the last 30 years has gone. EXPLAINED:Why Russia wants eastern Donbas IN MAPS:Tracking the invasion UKRAINE:Where have millions of refugees gone?

"Rita, 17, has made friends and is being positive about the changes happening to her group A group of Ukrainian orphans - extracted from a war zone by a Scottish charity started by football fans - have finally settled into their new home. The group of 52 children and their guardians made headlines whenthe Dnipro Kids charity fought red tape to bring them to safety in Scotland. After a month of rest and recovery in Callander near Stirling, they are now living in Edinburgh. Some of the older children have been speaking about their new lives. Rita, 17, thinks Scotland is ""beautiful"". She said: ""It's very pretty. I like it very much and the place we stay in is very different from what we have in Ukraine. So far we like everything. I like it here."" Ukrainian orphans find sanctuary in Scotland Ukrainian orphans permitted to travel to Scotland Ukrainians inspire good deeds for war effort But there is still a lingering sadness for what has been left behind. ""On one side I am so very sad for so many friends I left in Ukraine, but I have met some good friends here in Scotland already. It's cool."" Sasha, 16, explained that the journey from Dnipro to Poland and then on to Scotland was ""difficult, long and uncomfortable"". He said the situation has been hard for all of them but that they have been supporting each other. As one of the older children, he helps his house mother. He said: ""It's lots of responsibility. I have to help my mother - she needs my help and I help her to stay more relaxed. ""It is difficult for the children to be in another country and they are doing their best, trying not to make mistakes that will cause any trouble. Mum always protects them asking them to be careful."" Sasha helps his house mothers and says all the children have been supporting each other Sasha likes Edinburgh and says Scottish people have been kind to them, but thoughts of home are never far away. ""It is a beautiful city and very nice people,"" he said. ""But I miss my home very much. I worry a lot because war takes a lot of innocent lives and I hope that all the people I love and care about will be safe. ""I miss Dnipro and I hope to go back soon."" Stevie Carr has worked with Dnipro Kids for many years and finds it hard to take in what the tiny charity has achieved in getting the  Ukrainian children out of the war-ravaged country . He told BBC Scotland: ""It's absolutely unbelievable that on the back of a just a football match 17 years ago, that this charity has managed to achieve something that was probably impossible to imagine at the start of March. ""The fact we have done it is phenomenal, with too many people to mention who have helped us along the way."" Hibernian supporters have kept the charity going since 2005 During a UEFA Cup trip to the Ukrainian city of Dnipropetrovsk, in September 2005, a handful of Hibernian FC supporters organised a collection for some local orphans. The gesture turned into an official charity and the team's supporters adopted the Dnipro Appeal. In its first year, funds bought the children of the orphanage winter coats and boots and then paid for medical equipment and repairs to their building. Over the years the charity helped more children in the city. After the Russian invasion, the plight of the children gained the charity support with both the Scottish and UK governments involved in efforts to evacuate the children to safety. English lessons began for the young people this week and City of Edinburgh Council is working on plans for the group which ranges in ages from one to 19. Andy McWhirter, from social work services, said the council's main role was to restore some sense of normality. ""The important thing is they are guests here and they all want to go home,"" he said. ""We need to find a balance to help them integrate and relate to Scotland but to support their Ukrainian identity and not impose our values and views on their experience."" Their education will be mindful of their connection to Ukraine, using online lessons being provided to displaced children by the Ukrainian authorities. English lessons began this week for the Dnipro young people Natalie Radchenko worked for Dnipro Kids in Ukraine and travelled with the group, often acting as their translator. She has seen a change in the children since they settled in Scotland. She said: ""We are all very happy to be somewhere nice and safe. ""Everyone is a bit tired of travelling but I think they are getting better after all the stress and the horrible situation. ""The kids were very quiet in the beginning but now you can see them smiling and happy."" Analysis from Catriona Renton, BBC Scotland Senior News Reporter It has been a long, exhausting and, at times, emotional journey. BBC Scotland first met the children and young people as they crossed the Polish border on their way to their ultimate destination - Edinburgh. In the last week they have been settling into their accommodation here. It is no mean feat for the tiny charity set up by Hibs supporters to get them here. The young people I spoke to were so positive and full of hope. The strong bonds between them are so clear to see with the older teenagers helping take care of the little ones. They are making the best of the most difficult of situations, laughing, smiling and playing with each other. Their house mothers show so much strength - they have left family behind but stoically support and protect their families here. But the biggest hope the young people and mothers have of all is to return to Dnipro and the people they love there.

"Police described Christopher Hughes as a ""dangerous individual"". A member of a major Scottish crime gang has been jailed for at least 25 years for the murder of a Dutch crime writer outside a sex club. Christopher Hughes lured Martin Kok, 49, to his death before he was shot eight times by a gunman in Laren, in the Netherlands, on 8 December 2016. Police described Hughes, 33, as a ""dangerous individual"" after he wasconvicted last month. He was part of a global enterprise that generated more than Â£100m a year. Hughes, originally from Glasgow, was also found guilty of involvement in serious organised crime between July 2013 and January 2020. Martin Kok died outside a club near Amsterdam in 2016 It was investigated as part of Police Scotland's Operation Escalade. Sentencing Hughes at the High Court in Stirling the judge, Lady Scott, said the murder was a ruthless ""execution."" Kok was a convicted killer, turned crime writer, who had set up a website detailing the activities of criminals in his homeland. During the trial it emerged Hughes met him at an Amsterdam hotel, then the Boccaccio sex club and alerted others to where he was. Martin Kok: Gangland figure guilty of murdering Dutch crime writer Martin Kok: Jurors shown footage of crime blogger's murder When the pair left the club Hughes paused to stroke a cat, before Kok was gunned down as a ""favour"" for seemingly angering Moroccan gangsters. Hughes was quizzed by Dutch police the next day, but was allowed to leave as the international probe into the shooting continued. It was his apparent confession to a fellow gang member-turned-informer which lead to his downfall. Hughes was arrested at a hotel in Turin, Italy in January 2020 and flown back to Scotland on a European Arrest Warrant. The court heard Hughes was a trusted member of heavily-armed group, which was part of a vast criminal network. Firearms traded by the organised gang were also used to enforce the gang's lucrative drugs operations It had links with gangs across the globe, from Colombian drug cartels to the Italian mafia. The group even invested in state-of-the-art surveillance equipment in a bid to establish if their network had been compromised by the authorities. During the trial at the High Court in Glasgow jurors were shown a photo of Hughes smiling with the two wanted men who run the operation. They cannot be identified for legal reasons. Hughes was listed by HMRC as ""unemployed"" but ""wages"" of Â£40,000-a-week earned him a luxury lifestyle in the Algarve. The informer explained to jurors in evidence that he was told to set a meeting up in an Amsterdam hotel between Hughes and Kok. He told the court he believed the meeting was to discuss advertising for the firm's encrypted phone company MPC, which was funded with Â£1m of dirty money, on Kok's new crime TV show. The downfall of Scotland's most dangerous crime gang The murder was originally due to happen outside the Citizen M Hotel in Amsterdam. But 11 months later, during a ""play by play"" of events at his flat in Antwerp, Belgium, Hughes told the informant that the gun had jammed and a second attempt was made later on the same day. Hours later, the court heard, Hughes paid for Kok's evening at the sex club and supplied him with cocaine. The informant stated that he was speaking to his crime boss on the night of the incident. ""He [the boss] had been on about someone waiting for Martin Kok and Christopher Hughes was to hold back,"" he said. ""Martin left just ahead of Chris and he made a comment about a cat appearing at the club and that he stepped back to pet it."" Prosecutor Liam Ewing QC asked what the significance of petting the cat was. The witness replied: ""Martin was going to his car first so there was no mistake of anyone being caught in the crossfire."" Jurors watched CCTV of Hughes moments after the shooting walking away from the scene texting on a mobile phone. Mr Ewing also asked the informer if Hughes understood something was to happen to Kok that night. He replied: ""I remember a comment being made about putting him [Kok] on a plate for the Roccies."" The witness claimed he had a meeting with his boss a month after the murder. He said: ""I was told it was an arrangement because the lad had access to Martin with a group called the Roccies, a Moroccan crime group, who are all over but more prominent in Amsterdam."" Hughes' boss then organised for him to be picked up as he hid in bushes while paramedics arrived at the scene. Gang member snared by elastic band DNA link The court heard Hughes was later put under surveillance by police and watched as he visited industrial units in Cambuslang and East Kilbride, South Lanarkshire as well as Chapelhall, North Lanarkshire. Mr Ewing told the jury in his closing speech that Â£700,000 was recovered from a machine inside one of the lock up garages. He added the lock-up in Chapelhall contained Â£40,000 of anti-surveillance equipment which is normally only found in the hands of government organisations. Police Scotland last month thanked law enforcement colleagues in the Netherlands and Italy for helping to bring the killer to justice. Det Chief Supt Stuart Houston, head of the organised crime unit, said: ""It has been well-documented that Hughes is a dangerous individual with a long association with organised crime in Scotland and beyond. ""He has wreaked havoc in our communities by trading illegal drugs to our communities and being involved in the importation of firearms which undoubtedly would have been used to harm or kill others."" A global investigation designed to dismantle Scotland's most sophisticated crime group has now resulted in 14 convictions. Clockwise from top left: Gerard Docherty, Steven McCardle, Francis Mulligan, David Sell, Barry O'Neill and Martyn Fitzsimmons. January 2018:A nine-man gang was jailedfor a total of 87 yearsafter a massive investigation into violence, drugs and firearms offences. They included cocaine dealer Mark Richardson and soldier turned gun-runner Martyn Fitzsimmons. The list of crimes included the ""merciless"" torture of a man over an unpaid drug debt and a huge arsenal of weapons found hidden in a car. Judge Lord Beckett said police had shown ""extraordinary ingenuity, courage and commitment"" to bring the gang to justice. April 2019:Daniel Lindsay and Darren Mulheron were both jailed for seven years after after officers seized Â£3.4m of heroin and cocaine as well as five Glock handguns. The pair from Castlemilk, Glasgow, pleaded guilty to being involved in serious organised crime. Lindsay, 49, also admitted being concerned in the supply of heroin and Mulheron, 36, to being involved in the supply of cocaine. Five months after his conviction Lindsay was ordered tohand over Â£600,000following a proceeds of crime action (Left to right) Joseph Lindsay's uncle Daniel Lindsay, Darren Mulheron and Paul Scott have also been convicted following two separate trials linked to Operation Escalade April 2019:The group'stechnical expert Paul Scottfled overseas after being charged over his role with the gang. The 47-year-old electrician, of Rutherglen, South Lanarkshire, eluded police for two years before being caught in Madrid in November 2018.

"The Co-op supermarket has announced plans to ditch use-by dates on its own-brand yoghurt in a bid to reduce food waste. The company said the label on packets and containers will instead be replaced by a best-before date as guidance. Six million people in the UK eat a yoghurt daily, the supermarket said. But research from recycling charity Wrap shows half of yoghurts are binned unopened, mainly because they were not eaten before the recommended date. The charity's research has also suggested 70% of food waste happens in homes. Use-by labels are the dates until which perishable food can be cooked and consumed safely. Best-before guidance, meanwhile, is for when the product should be consumed to get the best quality, taste and texture. The Food Standards Agencysays it is up to manufacturers to decide,externalwhether to apply a use-by or best-before date on their products. It will depend on factors such as how the food is made and how risky it is, it said. In January, fellow supermarket Morrisonsgot rid of use by dates on its own-brand milk,in a move it said was aimed at preventing millions of pints being poured down the sink. Nick Cornwell, head of food technical at the Co-op, said yoghurt can be safe if stored unopened in a fridge after the date mark, as the acidity of the dairy product acts as a natural defence for food safety. He explained the supermarket were encouraging shoppers to ""use their judgment"" if their yoghurt has passed its best-before date, adding the move was designed to help reduce food waste. For foods with a best before date, the FSA urges people to use their senses to check whether it is appropriate to eat. It suggests smelling some dairy products with a best before date to see if they have soured. Want to cut food waste? There's an app for that Mr Cornwell said the move would hopefully help customers to make minor changes which can ""collectively make a big impact and combat unnecessary food waste"". ""Controlling food waste is not only beneficial for managing household budgets, it also has an environmental benefit and will ultimately help reduce carbon emissions,"" he added. Mr Cornwell also called on other retailers and food brands to review their own pack guidance practices and also make the yoghurt labelling switch.

"Boris Johnson has dismissed threats to his leadership, as the row over lockdown parties in Downing Street continues. Questions over the PM's position have been reignited this week after MPs backed a Commons inquiry into whether he has misled them. A senior Tory predicted it is ""a matter of when not if"" the PM now faces a no confidence vote from his own MPs. But Mr Johnson insisted he would still be in office this autumn. Asked during a trip to India whether he would still be in post by hisOctober targetfor a trade deal with the country, he replied: ""Yes"". And he sought to play down the partygate row, saying voters wanted the government to ""focus on the issues on which we were elected"". Analysis: Turbulent week puts PM's leadership back in frame What did Boris Johnson tell Parliament about parties? A timeline of the lockdown parties Mr Johnson is facing a future investigation by the Commons privileges committee, after MPs gave the go-ahead on Thursday. No 10 initially tried to delay a vote on approving the inquiry, but later backed down in the face of unease among Tory backbenchers. The committee will determine whether he misled MPs by telling them Covid rules were followed in No 10 - a charge regarded as a resigning matter under the ministerial rulebook. Last week, Mr Johnson, his wife Carrie and the Chancellor Rishi Sunak were fined by the police for breaching lockdown rules by attending a gathering to celebrate his birthday in June 2020. The PM is known to have attended at least two more of the 12 events being investigated by Met police, meaning he could be fined again. The fine has led to renewed calls for Mr Johnson to resign - and increasing speculation he could face a leadership challenge from within his party if May's local elections go badly for the Tories. This video can not be played WATCH: Ros Atkins Onâ¦ The PM and the Ministerial Code Tory peer and polling expert Lord Hayward said he expected Mr Johnson to eventually face a leadership challenge. He warned the various investigations into the PM's conduct could prove a ""death by a thousand cuts"" - and figures in the party wanted the question over his position to be resolved. ""We are moving to a position, despite what the prime minister says, [where] Tory MPs, Tory associations, Tory councillors, do not want an even more protracted process,"" he added. ""We've had it basically since before Christmas now, and I expect that were will be some form of contest for leadership at some stage."" Hindsight may have helped, but some Conservative MPs claim Thursday's chaotic events in Parliament could've been predicted. They point back to Tuesday when relatively few Tory backbenchers stood up to defend Boris Johnson after his statement about being fined. Something has shifted according to one critic of the prime minister, who claimed more and more of their colleagues were reluctant to back him in public. Boris Johnson still has plenty of supporters and many are giving him the benefit of the doubt until after the police investigation and Sue Gray report. The patience of some others is wearing thin, but there is no sign of any immediate co-ordinated move to challenge the PM's position. Nevertheless, Boris Johnson will return from his trip to India having lost the support of more of his MPs and facing a third investigation into his conduct. Earlier, Tory MP Tobias Ellwood said Conservative MPs were ""deeply troubled"" about the ""long-term damage to the party's brand"" caused by the partygate saga. Also predicting Mr Johnson would face a vote of no confidence, the defence committee chair accused No 10 of lacking ""discipline, focus and leadership"". Labour shadow minister Peter Kyle said Mr Johnson was a ""dead man walking"" who could no longer manage the country or his own party. But Northern Ireland Minister Conor Burns, a longtime ally of the PM, dismissed criticism from Conservative MPs, saying some of his colleagues had never supported the prime minister. ""If the prime minister stepped off Westminster Bridge and walked down the Thames on top of water they would say it was because he couldn't swim,"" he said. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon - who was herselfspoken to by policeafter being filmed breaching Scotland's face mask rules - said Mr Johnson was ""unfit for office"" and predicted he would be forced out. Liberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper said the Partygate issue was ""a huge distraction for Boris Johnson and the government, and this is why he should have resigned a long time ago."" The Commons privileges committee will determine whether the PM committed a ""contempt"" of Parliament by knowingly misleading MPs. It is made up of seven MPs - two from Labour (Yvonne Fovargue and Chris Bryant), one SNP (Allan Dorans) and four Conservatives (Andy Carter, Alberto Costa, Laura Farris and Sir Bernard Jenkin). Mr Bryant, who chairs the committee, has stepped back from the investigation as he had already commented publicly on the matter. It is understood that Labour is considering options within the party to replace him during the investigation. If the committee finds Mr Johnson did mislead Parliament, they can recommend a sanction which could include suspension from Parliament or ordering him to apologise. The whole House of Commons would then have to sign off on any punishment.

"The moment Saint West shows his mother the Roblox sex tape room he apparently found A reality show scene where Kim Kardashian's son finds an advert for a sex tape on the game Roblox was not faked, a source close to the star says. In the scene, Saint West, six, shows his mother a ""Kim Kardashian experience"" room he apparently stumbled across while playing the game. Roblox said it removed the room and banned its creator - and no sex tape was ever available. It also said only ""a few dozen players"" found it in the short time it was live. On social media and in some news reports, people have suggested the chances of Saint West being one of those who found it are slim. One well known independent Roblox developer known as Zomebody told BBC News: ""The chances of 'accidentally' stumbling upon a game like that are astronomically small. ""There are two potential ways for Saint to have found such a game - either he or the family actively searched for (or even created) such a game or someone else in their group of peers created it and then shared it directly with the boy."" Neither the Kardashians nor the production company, Fulwell 73, provided an on-the-record comment but a source close to the family insisted the scene was not falsified. Kim Kardashian sued in crypto 'pump and dump' case Kim Kardashian West joins billionaires' club Fifty million players worldwide log in to Roblox every day to explore, play mini-games and create their own experiences. There are millions of player-generated experiences and mini games, with new features added daily. The most popular experiences are showcased to Roblox players through a curated home screen but others can be found using the search function. The vast majority of these zones are not advertised to players and do not receive many visitors. The moment Saint West finds the Roblox room is a central driver of the drama in the first episode of the new show, The Kardashians, a reboot of the long-running Keeping Up With the Kardashians reality show. He is seen running up to his mother, saying: ""Everybody look it, this is on Roblox,"" before handing her his tablet computer. Kim Kardashian has thanked fans for the success of the first episode of her new show The tablet screen is blurred but Kim Kardashian describes what she saw to an interviewer: ""There was a picture of my cry face and I look at it and it said something super-inappropriate like, 'Kim's new sex tape'. This is supposed to be unreleased footage from my old sex tape."" A sex tape of Kim Kardashian was published online in 2007. Later in the episode, using strong language, she threatens to sue Roblox telling her lawyer she has ""all the time, all the money and all the resources to burn them to the... ground"". Roblox, which is valued at about $24bn (Â£18bn), said it took action against the content as soon as its moderators were alerted in September 2021. The show aired on Hulu in the US and Disney+ elsewhere, last week. There is no public record of a lawsuit filed against the company. A Roblox spokesman said: ""The text reference to the tape that got around our filters was quickly taken down and fortunately visible only to a few dozen people on the platform. We also swiftly took down the associated experience and banned the community developer involved with the incident."" Roblox would not say who had created the room, exactly how many players had entered it before it had been removed or how the company had been notified about it. Hulu, which did not respond to requests for comment, celebrated the success of the show, which had the biggest US premiere in the streaming service's history.

"Russia says it has destroyed six substations powering Ukrainian railways used to transport foreign weapons Ukraine's armed forces say Russia is targeting rail junctions to hit military supply routes At least five people in central Ukraine were killed in the attacks, Ukrainian officials say About 15,000 Russian troops have been killed since Russia invaded Ukraine, UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace says US Secretary of State Antony Blinken says Russia is trying to brutalise parts of Ukraine but failing in its war aims He was speaking after meeting President Zelensky in Kyiv on Sunday US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin, who also went to Kyiv, said the US wanted to see Russia militarily weakened Edited by Jude Sheerin Theo LeggettBBC International Business Correspondent Global military spending exceeded $2tn (Â£1.6tn) for the first time in 2021, with Russia's increased significantly, a new report says. It was the seventh year in which the total had risen, the report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute said. The rise in military spending is set to continue, as European countries build up their armed forces in response to Russiaâs invasion of Ukraine. The US spent more than $800bn on its military last year, more than double that of any other country. Russia increased its military spending by nearly 3%, helped by higher oil and gas revenues, as it built up its forces on the Ukrainian border. Finland and Sweden are gearing up to announce at the same time in May that they want to join Nato, Finnish and Swedish tabloids have reported. Both countries are militarily non-aligned but Russia's invasion of Ukraine has prompted increasing public support for joining the Western defensive alliance. Finnish newspaper Iltalehti says it believes the leaders of Finland and Sweden plan to meet in the week of 16 May and then announce that they will apply to join Nato. Finnish Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto declined to comment. The Swedish tabloid Aftonbladet, citing unnamed sources, also said it believed the two countries would make announcements that week, at the same time as each other. Russia has warned of a nuclear build-up in the Baltic should Finland and Sweden join Nato. Reality Check A MiG-29 on display at an air base in india India has been under pressure to help isolate Russia after its invasion of Ukraine. But it has long-standing defence ties to Moscow. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, visiting the US, has said that while India would like to be a âgood friendâ to Western countries, it needed to protect its interests and ensure its security. Data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri), shows that India is one of the worldâs largest buyers of weapons. And since 1992, about two-thirds of its military equipment has come from Russia. It has diversified its sources of weapons in recent years, buying more equipment from other countries. But if you look at the period from 2016 to 2021, Russia continued to be by far the largest supplier of weapons to India, accounting for twice as much as the next biggest supplier, France. Alina Kabaeva is a 38-year old Olympic gold medalist White House press secretary Jen Psaki denied at Monday's daily press briefing the US was deliberately holding off on sanctioning the woman believed to be Putin's girlfriend. ""We're continuing to review sanctions,"" Psaki said when asked why Russian politician and ex-gymnast Alina Kabaeva had not yet been targeted. ""No-one is safe from our sanctions,"" Psaki continued. ""We've already of course sanctioned President Putin, but also his daughter and his closest cronies, and we will continue to review more,"" she added. Calls have been rising for the US to sanction the 38-year old Olympic gold medalist, as the US has done to Putin's two adult daughters. Putin is known for being intensely private about his personal life, and has never acknowledged any romantic relationship with Russia's ""secret first lady"", as she has been dubbed in the Russian and foreign press. According to a Wall Street Journal report, US officials have withheld sanctions on Kabaeva due to concerns that Putin would view it as a personal attack. It would be viewed as ""so personal a blow to Mr Putin that it could further escalate tensions between Russia and the US"", the Journal wrote. An railway electricity substation near Lviv was damaged in a Russian strike aimed at halting the supply of foreign weapons If you're just joining us, here's a round-up of the latest events in Ukraine.  Lavrov also acknowledged there's a possibility of the conflict escalating to nuclear weapons, though he also sounded a hopeful note about the prospects of a peace accord. Speaking to the Russian First Channel on Monday, he said Moscow wanted to avoid ""artificially"" elevated risks of such a conflict. ""This is our key position on which we base everything. The risks now are considerable,"" Lavrov said. ""I would not want to elevate those risks artificially. Many would like that. The danger is serious, real, And we must not underestimate it."" Lavrov also accused President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine of ""pretending"" to negotiate, calling him ""a good actorâ. ""If you watch attentively and read attentively what he says, you'll find a thousand contradictions,"" Russiaâs top diplomat said. The foreign minister said last week that Moscow was committed to avoiding a nuclear war. On Monday, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted that Lavrovâs latest comments were an indication Russia had lost its ""last hope to scare the world off supporting Ukraineâ. ""Thus the talk of a ârealâ danger of WWIII. This only means Moscow senses defeat in Ukraine,"" he tweeted. Days after the invasion began back on 24 February, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his nuclear forces to be on alert. The US and its Nato allies have said they do not want direct military intervention in Ukraine, in order to avoid the risks of a Third World War. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has said deliveries of Western weaponry to Ukraine mean that the Nato alliance is ""in essence engaged in war with Russiaâ. In an interview aired on Monday, he said: ""These weapons will be a legitimate target for Russiaâs military acting within the context of the special operation.â Lavrov also told state television: ""Nato, in essence, is engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy. War means war."" In his nightly video address to the nation, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says that Ukraine's victory is inevitable, but it is impossible to predict when the war will conclude. ""Many cities and communities are still under the temporary control of the Russian army,"" he says in his address. ""But I have no doubt that it is only a matter of time before we liberate our land."" Earlier in his address, he marked the fact that the invasion, which began on 24 February, has just surpassed the three-month mark. Zelensky goes on to say that there is ""no simple answer"" to the question of when Ukraine will defeat the Russians, adding that victory - and peace - will come more quickly if every Ukrainian fights. ""When we gain a victory, everyone will feel it. When peace comes, everyone will see it. ""But for this to happen - and happen faster - we need to think not about when and what it will be. We must think every day about how to make the stay of the occupiers on our land even more unbearable."" ""For Russia to seek peace, every Ukrainian must still fight,"" he continues. ""They must defend freedom. Because every day of struggle now adds years of peaceful life after this war. After our victory."" This ambulance was one of 20 donated earlier this month to the war-torn country The UK is donating 22 new ambulances and medical equipment to Ukraine following a request from the government there, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has announced. It comes just weeks after a shipment of 20 ambulances was sent to the country, as it battles against the Russian invasion. Medical aid charity UK-Med, which works on the front line of disasters around the world, has been given Â£300,000 of funding to train Ukrainian doctors, nurses and paramedics in dealing with mass casualties. The charity has also been given Â£300,000 of medicines and other pharmaceutical supplies to bring to Ukrainian medical staff. More than 40 fire engines have already arrived in Ukraine from the UK, after the nation saw more than 100 of its fire stations and 250 fire engines destroyed in the war. Steve RosenbergRussia editor, reporting from Bryansk Plumes of smoke were captured rising into the sky from the oil depot in Bryansk on a video on social media The city of Bryansk is a hundred miles from Russiaâs border
with Ukraine. But today it looked like it was on the front line. Plumes of
thick black smoke dominated the skyline - the consequence of fires overnight.
First one fuel depot erupting in flames, and then another. The cause? Well, thereâs been no official explanation - there
is, however, much speculation. Was this the result of a Ukrainian strike to
disrupt logistics for Russiaâs military offensive? Was it sabotage by Russian
opponents of the Kremlinâs so-called special military operation? Neither Moscow
nor Kyiv is saying. Whatever the cause, the fires have sparked concern amongst
the Russian public. Here are some of the things people told me on the streets
of Bryansk: âThis never happened before. At 3am we heard explosions.
Weâre amazed.â âI donât know what this is. Is it war here? Well, I suppose
weâre on the front line. I wonder if Ukraine did this..?â We have seen something similar in Belgorod, earlier this
month. Another blaze at another Russian fuel depot near the border. Russia
claimed Ukrainian helicopter gunships had opened fire. Kyiv wouldnât confirm
it. But one thing is clear. Despite President Putinâs claims
that he sent his troops into Ukraine to bring Russians security, there is
little sign of that. Electronic equipment which could be used to intercept communications and spy on Ukrainians is the latest category of products to be banned by the UK for export to Russia. The Department for International Trade also announced the UK would remove tariffs and quotes on products from Ukraine, responding to a request from President Volodymyr Zelensky to support the country's economy as it defends itself from invasion. The decision would affect key Ukrainian exports such as barley, honey, tinned tomatoes and poultry, the UK said. Tariffs will be lifted for 12 months initially, but could be extended. As well as equipment used to intercept and monitor communications, the UK has previously banned the export of luxury goods, aviation and space equipment, oil refining items and advanced technologies such as quantum computing. Jonathan BealeDefence correspondent, reporting from Donbas Lieutenant Denys Gordeev is used to war, but not like this. ""It's become much harder,"" he says. ""We have bomb attacks, rocket attacks every day, all the time, every hour."" Though he has spent eight years battling Russian-backed separatists in the Donbas, now he and his men are facing the full might of the Russian army. After its retreat from Kyiv three weeks ago, Russia has refocused its military efforts in Eastern Ukraine - with its goal of taking the whole of the Donbas region. It has redeployed many of its units to the east. Western officials estimate that Russia now has about 76 Battalion Tactical Groups in the region - each of which has about 800 men. They also say there's some evidence Russia's been addressing some of its early mistakes, helped by the fact they're now fighting on fewer fronts, and under a unified command. The result is that Ukrainian forces are struggling to hold a 300-mile front in the Donbas. They've already lost ground to the Russians and are likely to lose more in the days ahead. Russian forces have been conducting probing attacks to find weak points in Ukraine's defences. For now the invading army is mostly using its artillery and rockets to grind down Ukraine's defences. Some military analysts expect a major assault is still to come. And Ukrainian forces, including Lt Gordeev and his unit, appear to be holding the line, although Western experts say they are already outnumbered three to one. Read the full report here. Now some news from Kherson, the only major city that Russian forces have taken and continued to occupy. Its Ukrainian mayor, Ihor Kolykhayev, has reported on Facebook that Russian armed men took control of the city council building on Monday. Although Kherson has been under Russian occupation since early March, the city council had still been functioning under Ukrainian control. Kolykhayev said the Russian military took away the keys to the building and exchanged the security guards for guards of their own. He said he left the building at 19.45 local time. Pravda, a Ukrainian news outlet, reported that from 26 April, Kherson city council would not be functioning. It added that the mayor and employees of the city council were given the chance to go home. Adam EastonWarsaw Correspondent Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki has said his government has sent tanks to Ukraine. During an interview with private broadcaster Polsat News, Morawiecki was asked if Poland has sent, or will send, tanks to Ukraine. He replied ""yes"", without giving further details. He said he would announce more information âin due courseâ but for the time being he wouldn't reveal how many tanks have been supplied for security reasons. For several weeks now, itâs been rumoured that Poland has been supplying Ukraine with Soviet-era T-72 tanks. The Ministry of Defence had refused to comment on the rumours. Morawiecki said that the matter of Poland supplying Ukraine with Soviet-era MiG-29 fighter jets is now âclosedâ. In March, Poland said it was ready to deploy the jets to the US Ramstein Air Base in Germany and put them at the disposal of the US military, but Washington rejected the offer. âThere is no such necessity, there are no such demands, no such requests,â he said, when asked if sending planes to Ukraine was still being considered. Several explosions have hit the state security ministry in the breakaway Moldovan region of Transnistria, the interior ministry said on its Telegram channel. The ministry said the building appeared to have been hit with rocket-propelled grenades, but it said no one was injured. It comes days after a Russian general suggested Moscow wanted totake full control of southern Ukraine, giving Russia access to the separatist region of Moldova which it supports. He said there was ""oppression of the Russian-speaking population"" in Transnistria, a claim which had also been made - without evidence - to justify the invasion of Ukraine. Ukraine's defence ministry saidthe incident was a ""planned provocation"" by Russia itself to instil ""panic and anti-Ukrainian sentiment"",external. A small Russian-speaking breakaway region, Transnistria borders Ukraine from the west. It claimed independence after the fall of the Soviet Union in a bloody conflict, but is not recognised internationally and officially remains part of Moldova. A senior Russian diplomat has said a ceasefire is not a good option at the moment, because it will give Ukrainian forces the chance to ""regroup and to stage more provocations"". Earlier today, Russia announced that it would be holding a ceasefire around the steelworks in the besieged city of Mariupol from 14:00 local time (11:00 GMT), to allow civilians to leave. But Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said no agreement had been reached and called for written security guarantees. Russia's first deputy permanent representative to the UN, Dmitry Polyanskiy, said Ukraine had claimed that there were some civilians in the Azovstal steel plant, where the last Ukrainian fighters in the city are holed up, but Ukrainian forces ""did not let them go"". He went on to say that Russia had not attacked residential areas in Odesa, Ukraine's Black Sea port city, over the weekend. On Saturday, Ukraine said that two missiles struck a military facility and two residential buildings in the city. But Polyanskiy said the residential buildings were hit by Ukraine air defences. He went on to reject the comments made by US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, who said Russia had failed to achieve its aims in the invasion. Polyanskiy said: ""I don't think we failed, frankly."" He added that Russia is conducting its ""military operation"" and it has ""its own aims"" and ""its own strategies"". Nikita, Oleksandr and Vira have been living in a succession of temporary lodgings as they wait for news of a visa A disabled teenaged refugee from Ukraine and his grandparents have been stuck in Paris for more than six weeks as they wait for their UK visa application to be processed. Kateryna Karpenko persuaded her nephew Nikita Shepel, and her parents Oleksandr and Vira, to flee Russian shelling and apply to come to join her in the UK, where she has lived for almost 10 years. But amid complaints that the UK Home Office has conducted a chaotic and overly-bureaucratic response to the Ukrainian refugee crisis, the estimated five working day wait for a visa has turned into more than a month in limbo, costing them thousands of pounds in accommodation. ""They had to go through a lot, fleeing Ukraine, and they have no idea what's happening with our home, our family, our lives,"" says Kateryna. A UK government spokesman said changes the Home Office has made to the system, including simpler forms and increase staff numbers, are working. Read more  US President Joe Biden has named the veteran diplomat Bridget Brink as the new US ambassador to Ukraine. Earlier today, the White House announced that Brink would be moving to fill ""a crucial position"", which has been vacant for the past three years. Washington said Brink's appointment came at a time when the US was ramping up its support for Ukraine, amid Russia's invasion. The new ambassador is currently serving as the US ambassador to Slovakia and has been a diplomat for 25 years. The White House added that Brink's ""decades of
experience make her uniquely suited for this moment in Ukraineâs
history"". A firefighter surveys the damage at an electricity substation powering the railway near Lviv We've been bringing you updates on the reports of attacks on railway infrastructure in Ukraine, which Ukrainian officials say killed five people. Earlier, Ukraine said Russia was trying to disrupt supply lines for military equipment from foreign countries. Now Russia has confirmed that was the purpose of the attacks, according to Reuters. The news agency is citing a statement from the Russian defence ministry, saying its missiles destroyed six facilities powering the railways that were used to supply Ukrainian forces with weapons from abroad. Ukrainian officials said five railway stations in the centre and west of the country came under attack within an hour this morning. An electricity substation powering overhead lines in Krasne, near Lviv, was also hit in a missile strike. Ukraine's defence minister has thanked the US for their military assistance - describing the relationship between the two nation's as as a ""true brotherhood"". Oleksii Reznikov's comments on Twitter follow the visit to Kyiv on Sunday by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. Mr Reznikov said the support given by the Biden administration is ""not measured in money, but in the saved lives of Ukrainians"". During the visit, it was announced that US diplomats will begin returning to Ukraine and the Washington will provide Ukraine with a further $700m in military aid. Mr Reznikov also shared a video where he can be seen shaking hands and embracing Austin, accompanied by the caption: ""This is more than partnership of state officials - this is true brotherhood.""

Russia's first deputy permanent representative to the UN, Dmitry Polyanskiy, said Ukraine had claimed that there were some civilians in the Azovstal steel plant, where the last Ukrainian fighters in the city are holed up, but Ukrainian forces ""did not let them go"". He went on to say that Russia had not attacked residential areas in Odesa, Ukraine's Black Sea port city, over the weekend. On Saturday, Ukraine said that two missiles struck a military facility and two residential buildings in the city. But Polyanskiy said the residential buildings were hit by Ukraine air defences. He went on to reject the comments made by US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, who said Russia had failed to achieve its aims in the invasion. Polyanskiy said: ""I don't think we failed, frankly."" He added that Russia is conducting its ""military operation"" and it has ""its own aims"" and ""its own strategies"". Nikita, Oleksandr and Vira have been living in a succession of temporary lodgings as they wait for news of a visa A disabled teenaged refugee from Ukraine and his grandparents have been stuck in Paris for more than six weeks as they wait for their UK visa application to be processed. Kateryna Karpenko persuaded her nephew Nikita Shepel, and her parents Oleksandr and Vira, to flee Russian shelling and apply to come to join her in the UK, where she has lived for almost 10 years. But amid complaints that the UK Home Office has conducted a chaotic and overly-bureaucratic response to the Ukrainian refugee crisis, the estimated five working day wait for a visa has turned into more than a month in limbo, costing them thousands of pounds in accommodation. ""They had to go through a lot, fleeing Ukraine, and they have no idea what's happening with our home, our family, our lives,"" says Kateryna. A UK government spokesman said changes the Home Office has made to the system, including simpler forms and increase staff numbers, are working. Read more  US President Joe Biden has named the veteran diplomat Bridget Brink as the new US ambassador to Ukraine. Earlier today, the White House announced that Brink would be moving to fill ""a crucial position"", which has been vacant for the past three years. Washington said Brink's appointment came at a time when the US was ramping up its support for Ukraine, amid Russia's invasion. The new ambassador is currently serving as the US ambassador to Slovakia and has been a diplomat for 25 years. The White House added that Brink's ""decades of
experience make her uniquely suited for this moment in Ukraineâs
history"". A firefighter surveys the damage at an electricity substation powering the railway near Lviv We've been bringing you updates on the reports of attacks on railway infrastructure in Ukraine, which Ukrainian officials say killed five people. Earlier, Ukraine said Russia was trying to disrupt supply lines for military equipment from foreign countries. Now Russia has confirmed that was the purpose of the attacks, according to Reuters. The news agency is citing a statement from the Russian defence ministry, saying its missiles destroyed six facilities powering the railways that were used to supply Ukrainian forces with weapons from abroad. Ukrainian officials said five railway stations in the centre and west of the country came under attack within an hour this morning. An electricity substation powering overhead lines in Krasne, near Lviv, was also hit in a missile strike. Ukraine's defence minister has thanked the US for their military assistance - describing the relationship between the two nation's as as a ""true brotherhood"". Oleksii Reznikov's comments on Twitter follow the visit to Kyiv on Sunday by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. Mr Reznikov said the support given by the Biden administration is ""not measured in money, but in the saved lives of Ukrainians"". During the visit, it was announced that US diplomats will begin returning to Ukraine and the Washington will provide Ukraine with a further $700m in military aid. Mr Reznikov also shared a video where he can be seen shaking hands and embracing Austin, accompanied by the caption: ""This is more than partnership of state officials - this is true brotherhood.""

"Russia says it has destroyed six substations powering Ukrainian railways used to transport foreign weapons Ukraine's armed forces say Russia is targeting rail junctions to hit military supply routes At least five people in central Ukraine were killed in the attacks, Ukrainian officials say About 15,000 Russian troops have been killed since Russia invaded Ukraine, UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace says US Secretary of State Antony Blinken says Russia is trying to brutalise parts of Ukraine but failing in its war aims He was speaking after meeting President Zelensky in Kyiv on Sunday US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin, who also went to Kyiv, said the US wanted to see Russia militarily weakened Edited by Jude Sheerin Theo LeggettBBC International Business Correspondent Global military spending exceeded $2tn (Â£1.6tn) for the first time in 2021, with Russia's increased significantly, a new report says. It was the seventh year in which the total had risen, the report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute said. The rise in military spending is set to continue, as European countries build up their armed forces in response to Russiaâs invasion of Ukraine. The US spent more than $800bn on its military last year, more than double that of any other country. Russia increased its military spending by nearly 3%, helped by higher oil and gas revenues, as it built up its forces on the Ukrainian border. Finland and Sweden are gearing up to announce at the same time in May that they want to join Nato, Finnish and Swedish tabloids have reported. Both countries are militarily non-aligned but Russia's invasion of Ukraine has prompted increasing public support for joining the Western defensive alliance. Finnish newspaper Iltalehti says it believes the leaders of Finland and Sweden plan to meet in the week of 16 May and then announce that they will apply to join Nato. Finnish Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto declined to comment. The Swedish tabloid Aftonbladet, citing unnamed sources, also said it believed the two countries would make announcements that week, at the same time as each other. Russia has warned of a nuclear build-up in the Baltic should Finland and Sweden join Nato. Reality Check A MiG-29 on display at an air base in india India has been under pressure to help isolate Russia after its invasion of Ukraine. But it has long-standing defence ties to Moscow. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, visiting the US, has said that while India would like to be a âgood friendâ to Western countries, it needed to protect its interests and ensure its security. Data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri), shows that India is one of the worldâs largest buyers of weapons. And since 1992, about two-thirds of its military equipment has come from Russia. It has diversified its sources of weapons in recent years, buying more equipment from other countries. But if you look at the period from 2016 to 2021, Russia continued to be by far the largest supplier of weapons to India, accounting for twice as much as the next biggest supplier, France. Alina Kabaeva is a 38-year old Olympic gold medalist White House press secretary Jen Psaki denied at Monday's daily press briefing the US was deliberately holding off on sanctioning the woman believed to be Putin's girlfriend. ""We're continuing to review sanctions,"" Psaki said when asked why Russian politician and ex-gymnast Alina Kabaeva had not yet been targeted. ""No-one is safe from our sanctions,"" Psaki continued. ""We've already of course sanctioned President Putin, but also his daughter and his closest cronies, and we will continue to review more,"" she added. Calls have been rising for the US to sanction the 38-year old Olympic gold medalist, as the US has done to Putin's two adult daughters. Putin is known for being intensely private about his personal life, and has never acknowledged any romantic relationship with Russia's ""secret first lady"", as she has been dubbed in the Russian and foreign press. According to a Wall Street Journal report, US officials have withheld sanctions on Kabaeva due to concerns that Putin would view it as a personal attack. It would be viewed as ""so personal a blow to Mr Putin that it could further escalate tensions between Russia and the US"", the Journal wrote. An railway electricity substation near Lviv was damaged in a Russian strike aimed at halting the supply of foreign weapons If you're just joining us, here's a round-up of the latest events in Ukraine.  Lavrov also acknowledged there's a possibility of the conflict escalating to nuclear weapons, though he also sounded a hopeful note about the prospects of a peace accord. Speaking to the Russian First Channel on Monday, he said Moscow wanted to avoid ""artificially"" elevated risks of such a conflict. ""This is our key position on which we base everything. The risks now are considerable,"" Lavrov said. ""I would not want to elevate those risks artificially. Many would like that. The danger is serious, real, And we must not underestimate it."" Lavrov also accused President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine of ""pretending"" to negotiate, calling him ""a good actorâ. ""If you watch attentively and read attentively what he says, you'll find a thousand contradictions,"" Russiaâs top diplomat said. The foreign minister said last week that Moscow was committed to avoiding a nuclear war. On Monday, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted that Lavrovâs latest comments were an indication Russia had lost its ""last hope to scare the world off supporting Ukraineâ. ""Thus the talk of a ârealâ danger of WWIII. This only means Moscow senses defeat in Ukraine,"" he tweeted. Days after the invasion began back on 24 February, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his nuclear forces to be on alert. The US and its Nato allies have said they do not want direct military intervention in Ukraine, in order to avoid the risks of a Third World War. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has said deliveries of Western weaponry to Ukraine mean that the Nato alliance is ""in essence engaged in war with Russiaâ. In an interview aired on Monday, he said: ""These weapons will be a legitimate target for Russiaâs military acting within the context of the special operation.â Lavrov also told state television: ""Nato, in essence, is engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy. War means war."" In his nightly video address to the nation, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says that Ukraine's victory is inevitable, but it is impossible to predict when the war will conclude. ""Many cities and communities are still under the temporary control of the Russian army,"" he says in his address. ""But I have no doubt that it is only a matter of time before we liberate our land."" Earlier in his address, he marked the fact that the invasion, which began on 24 February, has just surpassed the three-month mark. Zelensky goes on to say that there is ""no simple answer"" to the question of when Ukraine will defeat the Russians, adding that victory - and peace - will come more quickly if every Ukrainian fights. ""When we gain a victory, everyone will feel it. When peace comes, everyone will see it. ""But for this to happen - and happen faster - we need to think not about when and what it will be. We must think every day about how to make the stay of the occupiers on our land even more unbearable."" ""For Russia to seek peace, every Ukrainian must still fight,"" he continues. ""They must defend freedom. Because every day of struggle now adds years of peaceful life after this war. After our victory."" This ambulance was one of 20 donated earlier this month to the war-torn country The UK is donating 22 new ambulances and medical equipment to Ukraine following a request from the government there, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has announced. It comes just weeks after a shipment of 20 ambulances was sent to the country, as it battles against the Russian invasion. Medical aid charity UK-Med, which works on the front line of disasters around the world, has been given Â£300,000 of funding to train Ukrainian doctors, nurses and paramedics in dealing with mass casualties. The charity has also been given Â£300,000 of medicines and other pharmaceutical supplies to bring to Ukrainian medical staff. More than 40 fire engines have already arrived in Ukraine from the UK, after the nation saw more than 100 of its fire stations and 250 fire engines destroyed in the war. Steve RosenbergRussia editor, reporting from Bryansk Plumes of smoke were captured rising into the sky from the oil depot in Bryansk on a video on social media The city of Bryansk is a hundred miles from Russiaâs border
with Ukraine. But today it looked like it was on the front line. Plumes of
thick black smoke dominated the skyline - the consequence of fires overnight.
First one fuel depot erupting in flames, and then another. The cause? Well, thereâs been no official explanation - there
is, however, much speculation. Was this the result of a Ukrainian strike to
disrupt logistics for Russiaâs military offensive? Was it sabotage by Russian
opponents of the Kremlinâs so-called special military operation? Neither Moscow
nor Kyiv is saying. Whatever the cause, the fires have sparked concern amongst
the Russian public. Here are some of the things people told me on the streets
of Bryansk: âThis never happened before. At 3am we heard explosions.
Weâre amazed.â âI donât know what this is. Is it war here? Well, I suppose
weâre on the front line. I wonder if Ukraine did this..?â We have seen something similar in Belgorod, earlier this
month. Another blaze at another Russian fuel depot near the border. Russia
claimed Ukrainian helicopter gunships had opened fire. Kyiv wouldnât confirm
it. But one thing is clear. Despite President Putinâs claims
that he sent his troops into Ukraine to bring Russians security, there is
little sign of that. Electronic equipment which could be used to intercept communications and spy on Ukrainians is the latest category of products to be banned by the UK for export to Russia. The Department for International Trade also announced the UK would remove tariffs and quotes on products from Ukraine, responding to a request from President Volodymyr Zelensky to support the country's economy as it defends itself from invasion. The decision would affect key Ukrainian exports such as barley, honey, tinned tomatoes and poultry, the UK said. Tariffs will be lifted for 12 months initially, but could be extended. As well as equipment used to intercept and monitor communications, the UK has previously banned the export of luxury goods, aviation and space equipment, oil refining items and advanced technologies such as quantum computing. Jonathan BealeDefence correspondent, reporting from Donbas Lieutenant Denys Gordeev is used to war, but not like this. ""It's become much harder,"" he says. ""We have bomb attacks, rocket attacks every day, all the time, every hour."" Though he has spent eight years battling Russian-backed separatists in the Donbas, now he and his men are facing the full might of the Russian army. After its retreat from Kyiv three weeks ago, Russia has refocused its military efforts in Eastern Ukraine - with its goal of taking the whole of the Donbas region. It has redeployed many of its units to the east. Western officials estimate that Russia now has about 76 Battalion Tactical Groups in the region - each of which has about 800 men. They also say there's some evidence Russia's been addressing some of its early mistakes, helped by the fact they're now fighting on fewer fronts, and under a unified command. The result is that Ukrainian forces are struggling to hold a 300-mile front in the Donbas. They've already lost ground to the Russians and are likely to lose more in the days ahead. Russian forces have been conducting probing attacks to find weak points in Ukraine's defences. For now the invading army is mostly using its artillery and rockets to grind down Ukraine's defences. Some military analysts expect a major assault is still to come. And Ukrainian forces, including Lt Gordeev and his unit, appear to be holding the line, although Western experts say they are already outnumbered three to one. Read the full report here. Now some news from Kherson, the only major city that Russian forces have taken and continued to occupy. Its Ukrainian mayor, Ihor Kolykhayev, has reported on Facebook that Russian armed men took control of the city council building on Monday. Although Kherson has been under Russian occupation since early March, the city council had still been functioning under Ukrainian control. Kolykhayev said the Russian military took away the keys to the building and exchanged the security guards for guards of their own. He said he left the building at 19.45 local time. Pravda, a Ukrainian news outlet, reported that from 26 April, Kherson city council would not be functioning. It added that the mayor and employees of the city council were given the chance to go home. Adam EastonWarsaw Correspondent Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki has said his government has sent tanks to Ukraine. During an interview with private broadcaster Polsat News, Morawiecki was asked if Poland has sent, or will send, tanks to Ukraine. He replied ""yes"", without giving further details. He said he would announce more information âin due courseâ but for the time being he wouldn't reveal how many tanks have been supplied for security reasons. For several weeks now, itâs been rumoured that Poland has been supplying Ukraine with Soviet-era T-72 tanks. The Ministry of Defence had refused to comment on the rumours. Morawiecki said that the matter of Poland supplying Ukraine with Soviet-era MiG-29 fighter jets is now âclosedâ. In March, Poland said it was ready to deploy the jets to the US Ramstein Air Base in Germany and put them at the disposal of the US military, but Washington rejected the offer. âThere is no such necessity, there are no such demands, no such requests,â he said, when asked if sending planes to Ukraine was still being considered. Several explosions have hit the state security ministry in the breakaway Moldovan region of Transnistria, the interior ministry said on its Telegram channel. The ministry said the building appeared to have been hit with rocket-propelled grenades, but it said no one was injured. It comes days after a Russian general suggested Moscow wanted totake full control of southern Ukraine, giving Russia access to the separatist region of Moldova which it supports. He said there was ""oppression of the Russian-speaking population"" in Transnistria, a claim which had also been made - without evidence - to justify the invasion of Ukraine. Ukraine's defence ministry saidthe incident was a ""planned provocation"" by Russia itself to instil ""panic and anti-Ukrainian sentiment"",external. A small Russian-speaking breakaway region, Transnistria borders Ukraine from the west. It claimed independence after the fall of the Soviet Union in a bloody conflict, but is not recognised internationally and officially remains part of Moldova. A senior Russian diplomat has said a ceasefire is not a good option at the moment, because it will give Ukrainian forces the chance to ""regroup and to stage more provocations"". Earlier today, Russia announced that it would be holding a ceasefire around the steelworks in the besieged city of Mariupol from 14:00 local time (11:00 GMT), to allow civilians to leave.

Though he has spent eight years battling Russian-backed separatists in the Donbas, now he and his men are facing the full might of the Russian army. After its retreat from Kyiv three weeks ago, Russia has refocused its military efforts in Eastern Ukraine - with its goal of taking the whole of the Donbas region. It has redeployed many of its units to the east. Western officials estimate that Russia now has about 76 Battalion Tactical Groups in the region - each of which has about 800 men. They also say there's some evidence Russia's been addressing some of its early mistakes, helped by the fact they're now fighting on fewer fronts, and under a unified command. The result is that Ukrainian forces are struggling to hold a 300-mile front in the Donbas. They've already lost ground to the Russians and are likely to lose more in the days ahead. Russian forces have been conducting probing attacks to find weak points in Ukraine's defences. For now the invading army is mostly using its artillery and rockets to grind down Ukraine's defences. Some military analysts expect a major assault is still to come. And Ukrainian forces, including Lt Gordeev and his unit, appear to be holding the line, although Western experts say they are already outnumbered three to one. Read the full report here. Now some news from Kherson, the only major city that Russian forces have taken and continued to occupy. Its Ukrainian mayor, Ihor Kolykhayev, has reported on Facebook that Russian armed men took control of the city council building on Monday. Although Kherson has been under Russian occupation since early March, the city council had still been functioning under Ukrainian control. Kolykhayev said the Russian military took away the keys to the building and exchanged the security guards for guards of their own. He said he left the building at 19.45 local time. Pravda, a Ukrainian news outlet, reported that from 26 April, Kherson city council would not be functioning. It added that the mayor and employees of the city council were given the chance to go home. Adam EastonWarsaw Correspondent Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki has said his government has sent tanks to Ukraine. During an interview with private broadcaster Polsat News, Morawiecki was asked if Poland has sent, or will send, tanks to Ukraine. He replied ""yes"", without giving further details. He said he would announce more information âin due courseâ but for the time being he wouldn't reveal how many tanks have been supplied for security reasons. For several weeks now, itâs been rumoured that Poland has been supplying Ukraine with Soviet-era T-72 tanks. The Ministry of Defence had refused to comment on the rumours. Morawiecki said that the matter of Poland supplying Ukraine with Soviet-era MiG-29 fighter jets is now âclosedâ. In March, Poland said it was ready to deploy the jets to the US Ramstein Air Base in Germany and put them at the disposal of the US military, but Washington rejected the offer. âThere is no such necessity, there are no such demands, no such requests,â he said, when asked if sending planes to Ukraine was still being considered. Several explosions have hit the state security ministry in the breakaway Moldovan region of Transnistria, the interior ministry said on its Telegram channel. The ministry said the building appeared to have been hit with rocket-propelled grenades, but it said no one was injured. It comes days after a Russian general suggested Moscow wanted totake full control of southern Ukraine, giving Russia access to the separatist region of Moldova which it supports. He said there was ""oppression of the Russian-speaking population"" in Transnistria, a claim which had also been made - without evidence - to justify the invasion of Ukraine. Ukraine's defence ministry saidthe incident was a ""planned provocation"" by Russia itself to instil ""panic and anti-Ukrainian sentiment"",external. A small Russian-speaking breakaway region, Transnistria borders Ukraine from the west. It claimed independence after the fall of the Soviet Union in a bloody conflict, but is not recognised internationally and officially remains part of Moldova. A senior Russian diplomat has said a ceasefire is not a good option at the moment, because it will give Ukrainian forces the chance to ""regroup and to stage more provocations"". Earlier today, Russia announced that it would be holding a ceasefire around the steelworks in the besieged city of Mariupol from 14:00 local time (11:00 GMT), to allow civilians to leave. But Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said no agreement had been reached and called for written security guarantees. Russia's first deputy permanent representative to the UN, Dmitry Polyanskiy, said Ukraine had claimed that there were some civilians in the Azovstal steel plant, where the last Ukrainian fighters in the city are holed up, but Ukrainian forces ""did not let them go"". He went on to say that Russia had not attacked residential areas in Odesa, Ukraine's Black Sea port city, over the weekend. On Saturday, Ukraine said that two missiles struck a military facility and two residential buildings in the city. But Polyanskiy said the residential buildings were hit by Ukraine air defences. He went on to reject the comments made by US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, who said Russia had failed to achieve its aims in the invasion. Polyanskiy said: ""I don't think we failed, frankly."" He added that Russia is conducting its ""military operation"" and it has ""its own aims"" and ""its own strategies"". Nikita, Oleksandr and Vira have been living in a succession of temporary lodgings as they wait for news of a visa A disabled teenaged refugee from Ukraine and his grandparents have been stuck in Paris for more than six weeks as they wait for their UK visa application to be processed. Kateryna Karpenko persuaded her nephew Nikita Shepel, and her parents Oleksandr and Vira, to flee Russian shelling and apply to come to join her in the UK, where she has lived for almost 10 years. But amid complaints that the UK Home Office has conducted a chaotic and overly-bureaucratic response to the Ukrainian refugee crisis, the estimated five working day wait for a visa has turned into more than a month in limbo, costing them thousands of pounds in accommodation. ""They had to go through a lot, fleeing Ukraine, and they have no idea what's happening with our home, our family, our lives,"" says Kateryna. A UK government spokesman said changes the Home Office has made to the system, including simpler forms and increase staff numbers, are working. Read more  US President Joe Biden has named the veteran diplomat Bridget Brink as the new US ambassador to Ukraine. Earlier today, the White House announced that Brink would be moving to fill ""a crucial position"", which has been vacant for the past three years. Washington said Brink's appointment came at a time when the US was ramping up its support for Ukraine, amid Russia's invasion. The new ambassador is currently serving as the US ambassador to Slovakia and has been a diplomat for 25 years. The White House added that Brink's ""decades of
experience make her uniquely suited for this moment in Ukraineâs
history"". A firefighter surveys the damage at an electricity substation powering the railway near Lviv We've been bringing you updates on the reports of attacks on railway infrastructure in Ukraine, which Ukrainian officials say killed five people. Earlier, Ukraine said Russia was trying to disrupt supply lines for military equipment from foreign countries. Now Russia has confirmed that was the purpose of the attacks, according to Reuters. The news agency is citing a statement from the Russian defence ministry, saying its missiles destroyed six facilities powering the railways that were used to supply Ukrainian forces with weapons from abroad. Ukrainian officials said five railway stations in the centre and west of the country came under attack within an hour this morning. An electricity substation powering overhead lines in Krasne, near Lviv, was also hit in a missile strike. Ukraine's defence minister has thanked the US for their military assistance - describing the relationship between the two nation's as as a ""true brotherhood"". Oleksii Reznikov's comments on Twitter follow the visit to Kyiv on Sunday by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. Mr Reznikov said the support given by the Biden administration is ""not measured in money, but in the saved lives of Ukrainians"". During the visit, it was announced that US diplomats will begin returning to Ukraine and the Washington will provide Ukraine with a further $700m in military aid. Mr Reznikov also shared a video where he can be seen shaking hands and embracing Austin, accompanied by the caption: ""This is more than partnership of state officials - this is true brotherhood.""

"Florida lawmakers have voted to strip Walt Disney of its special self-governing status amid a political clash between the company and the governor. The status gave Disney powers to levy tax, build roads and control utilities on the lands of its theme park. The entertainment conglomerate did not respond to a request for comment. The move is widely seen as retribution for Disney's opposition to a bill that bars many primary-school classrooms from discussing sexual orientation. On Thursday, at the urging of Republican Governor Ron DeSantis, the state House passed a bill that would rid the company of its near-total power over the special district where its theme park is based. It had already passed the Senate. Known as the Reedy Creek Improvement District, it was created in a 1967 deal between the state and the Walt Disney Company. Governor DeSantis had previously made it clear he will sign the measure into law. Following the vote, Disney's special district will be dissolved on 1 June, 2023. Its special status had effectively allowed the company to operate as its own municipal government, with its own board of supervisors and fire department, and meant Disney could even build its own airport, or nuclear power plant if desired. It had given the entertainment giant freedom from almost all bureaucratic intervention for half a century and is thought to have saved it from tens of millions of dollars in taxes and fees. And it is part of why Disney chose to build its theme parks in Florida, where it has become the state's largest private employer, with some 80,000 jobs. But Disney's special relationship with the state of Florida came under threat over its response to a gender and sexuality education bill signed by Mr DeSantis last month. Formally called the Parental Rights in Education Law, it has been dubbed the ""Don't Say Gay"" law by critics. It prohibits any instruction about sexual orientation or gender identity between kindergarten and third grade - when students are roughly between five and nine years old. It also calls on school districts to avoid LGBT topics ""when not age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students"". The legislation also extends to student support services, including counselling, and grants parents the power to sue schools directly if they believe an educator has broken the law. Opponents say the law will isolate and stigmatise LGBT youth, while supporters say it protects children from age-inappropriate content. Disney initially stayed tight-lipped on the bill, but reversed course amid pressure from employees to oppose the policy. After it became law, Disney promised to push for its repeal and fight similar bills across the US. In response, Mr DeSantis said the company, which has made Florida its home, had ""crossed the line"". Earlier this month, Republican lawmakers in the US Congress said they would oppose renewing the company's copyright on Mickey Mouse in 2024 because of Disney's ""political and sexual agenda"". Analysis By Mat Morrison The political skies are cloudy in the Sunshine State, and it could be the smoke from the culture wars below. Governor Ron DeSantis is leading a charge, with a general's eagerness for combat and a politician's eye for opportunity. Florida-based Disney is only the latest target in his crosshairs, and the so-called ""Don't Say Gay"" bill just one of a string of conservative laws with Tallahassee origins grabbing national headlines. There's also been the banning of maths textbooks that the state deemed inappropriate for the classroom. That came after a bill - supported by Mr DeSantis - that makes it easier for parents to challenge books and instructional materials they disapprove of. Supporters say it gives parents a great say in their children's education. Opponents say it's simply censorship. The governor has also weighed in on the battle over Twitter, vowing to take on the company's board of directors over their tussle with Elon Musk. According to Bloomberg, Florida's state pension fund holds roughly a million shares, which may help explain Mr DeSantis's interest. And to top it off, he recently signed into law a ban on abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, with no exemptions for rape or incest. The flurry of bills aimed at exciting conservative voters boils down to one important date: 5 November, 2024 - the next US presidential election day. Read Mat's full analysis here.

"The Earl and Countess of Wessex leave for their seven-day trip on Friday The Grenada leg of the Earl and the Countess of Wessex's Caribbean tour has been postponed, a day before their week-long trip begins. The decision was made after talks with the island's government and governor general, Buckingham Palace said. Prince Edward and Sophie will still visit other islands on the tour to mark the Queen's Platinum Jubilee. It comes after the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were criticised for some parts of their recent Caribbean tour. A Buckingham Palace source said discussions were held with host nations to ensure the itinerary would meet the aims of the tour, which are to celebrate the islands and mark the Queen's 70-year reign. Within those discussions, Grenada - on the advice of Dame Cecile La Grenade, its governor general and the Queen's representative in the country - suggested a postponement. No further detail has yet been given about the reason for the delay. Prince Edward and Sophie hope to visit the island at a later date, the palace said. Their tour of three Caribbean nations - St Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Antigua and Barbuda - will begin on Friday. The plan must have seemed straightforward - send members of the Queen's family to her Realms (the countries where she is Head of State) to celebrate their culture and futures in this, her Platinum year. Yes - Princess Anne had a controversy-free trip to Australia and Papua New Guinea earlier this month and next month Prince Charles will travel to Canada. But the negative headlines which buffeted the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's Caribbean tour last month will have concentrated Palace minds. Although no reason has been given for the postponement of the Earl and Countess of Wessex's trip to Grenada, the key word in the brief statement announcing the change of plan must be ""consultation"". In Belize, the protest that derailed the Cambridges' trip on its very first day was reportedly because local people felt they had not been consulted on the plans for the visit. Last year, Barbados removed the Queen as its head of state. Last month, welcoming Catherine and William to his country, the Jamaican prime minister made clear his wish to do the same. Politicians in Grenada have called for a referendum on whether to become a republic. The country's reparations committee - which is calling for compensation from Britain as a result of the slave trade - says it requested an audience with the royal couple. So maybe the reason Grenada was dropped is that it was felt a visit may be deemed too political and a risk from a PR perspective. As the Cambridges found out, tours that once may have provided picturesque photo opportunities can now be viewed as a reminder of darker times involving colonialism and slavery. The palace will be hoping enough ""consultation"" has been done to ensure the Earl and Countess receive a warm welcome on the islands that remain on the itinerary. In March, part ofPrince William and Catherine's Caribbean tourwas axed after opposition from locals. The pair had been due to visit a cacao farm in the foothills of the Maya Mountains but it was removed from the couple's schedule following reports of a protest opposing the royal trip. Other moments on their tourwere criticised as public relations missteps- for example a Land Rover trip that was described as having a colonial appearance, and the greeting of local children through a wire fence. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge visited the Caribbean for their first overseas trip since the start of the pandemic Grenada gained independence from the UK in 1974 when Eric Gairy became the island's first prime minister. The National Democratic Congress, a liberal opposition party, has previously said it wouldput the question of whether the Queen should be head of state to a referendum,external. It also congratulated the prime minister of Barbados for having taken this step ahead ofthe island becoming a republic last year. Who's in the UK Royal Family and how does it work? The press secretary for the prime minister's office in Grenada said there was amutual agreement between the parties to postpone the visit,external. During the upcoming tour, Prince Edward will conduct an investiture on behalf of the Queen and the couple will attend a service to mark the Platinum Jubilee. The couple are due to meet local communities, Commonwealth Games athletes, craftspeople and women in leadership roles during their trip.

Please join us at this webpagefor all the latest. Russian state media reports that Russian forces have seized identifying information on all of Ukraine's special security services (SBU) personnel in the Kherson region. According to the Ria Novosti news agency, a cache of documents abandoned by SBU employees fleeing the region fell into the hands of Russian troops. The recovered documents contained names and photos, some of which were published in full by the outlet. Ria Novosti also alleges that the SBU includes special forces trained in sabotage and reconnaissance, and working for the government. The BBC has not independently verified these claims. Toby LuckhurstReporting from Lviv It was a moment of defiance that summed up the spirit of a
nation â when defenders of a small Ukrainian island, ordered to surrender by
the Russian warship Moskva, told the vessel to go away (in more
colourful language than we can report here). Ukraine has now immortalised the moment with limited
edition commemorative postal stamps. Theyâve quickly become the must-have collectible across the country. Julia Aurora Ogorodnyk is a food writer in Lviv. She was in
her car when she heard on the radio that the first ones had been released. She
went to the post office first thing the next morning, and just in time - only
four were left. Julia shows off the stamps Knowing how popular they were proving, she had them stamped with the date, making them more valuable by showing they were part of the first batch released. âItâs more unique,â she said. That same day, reports emerged that the Moskva had sunk. âSo now itâs even more valuable!â she says. She doesnât plan to sell them, at least not yet â sheâll save them for herself, and might put them on display at home. âItâs a symbol of how a small person can resist huge forces â and make them regret it!â You can read morehereabout the Moskva warship and its encounter with the Snake Island soldiers. The Russians have left but the suburbs of Kyiv are still dangerous. Officers are working to clear towns of mines and shells left behind by Russian forces. And increasing numbers of people are checking into hospital after making contact with the unexploded munitions. This video can not be played Ukrainians injured or killed by unexploded ammunition The letter ""Z"" has become a staunchly pro-war symbol of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, sported by politicians, athletes and others. BBC Russian reports that anti-war rock band DDT were set to perform at an auditorium in the central city of Tyumen, only to find ""a huge letter Z"" had been drawn inside the hall. The group's lead singer Yuri Shevchuk - who has spoken out against the war and Vladimir Putin several times - told a local journalist the group had refused to play at the site. He added that DDT had picked another site, without the letter Z, but had not been allowed to perform there either. Read more: Why has 'Z' become a Russian pro-war symbol? US Attorney General Merrick Garland has said American prosecutors are looking into evidence of potential war crimes by Russian forces in Ukraine. At a news conference on Thursday, he said the US had been ""in contact with the Prosecutor General of Ukraine"", along with other international allies assisting in the effort. ""We are helping in the collection of evidence and the preservation of evidence relating to possible war crimes,"" said Garland. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says Russia has rejected a proposal for a ceasefire during Orthodox Easter, taking place on Sunday 24 April. Senior members of the clergy across the globe have been pressing the Russian Orthodox Church to condemn the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine. The Russian Orthodox Church has not commented on the issue. In a video address, Zelensky said despite the rejected truce, he still harbours hopes for peace. The Kremlin has not confirmed the Ukrainian leader's claim. If you're just joining us, here are the latest developments on the war in Ukraine: Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk apologised to residents of Mariupol for failed evacuation efforts from the besieged port city. In a Telegram post,external, she said ""everything is very complicated, chaotic, slow and, of course, dishonest"" from the Russian side. Ukrainian authorities have been trying to evacuate people from Mariupol throughout the conflict, and humanitarian efforts were often called off due to a lack of Russian cooperation, according to Ukraine. Vereshchuk said shelling near one of the evacuation collection points in the city forced Ukraine to close the humanitarian corridor to Zaporizhzhia. She added: ""we will not give up trying to get you out of there! Hold on!"". As we've been reporting, Ukraine hoped to evacuate 6,000 people on Wednesday but around 80 were able to make it to Ukraine-controlled Zaporizhzhia. Ukrainian officials estimate that 100,000 people are currently trapped in Mariupol. Some of the Mariupol residents arriving in Zaporizhzhia on Thursday Ukrainian Ministry of Defence image of a Russian helicopter being shot down in early March The latest $800m (Â£612.5m) package for Ukraine includes ""dozens"" of howitzers - a type of artillery that fires shells at targets on high trajectories - as well as 144,000 rounds of ammunition and tactical drones to be used on the flat plains in eastern Ukraine. Other armaments sent so far include Switchblade drones that can be turned into flying bombs and anti-aircraft weapons that can shoot helicopters from the sky. In total, more than $3bn in military aid has been sent to Ukraine since Russia invaded on 24 February. ""Sometimes we will speak softly and carry a large Javelin, because we're sending a lot of those in as well,"" Mr Biden said this week of US aid to Ukraine, in reference to the anti-tank weapon. Additionally, the Pentagon said on Thursday that it is giving Ukraine ""ghost drones"" - similar in capabilities to the Switchblade ""kamikaze drones"". A Pentagon official sid the weapons were ""rapidly developed by the Air Force in response specifically to Ukrainian requirements"". The range and specific capabilities of the ""ghost drones"", however, are not publicly known. The US has so far been reluctant to send Ukraine US-made tanks, arguing that Ukrainian troops aren't familiar with the vehicles. Similarly, while the US has so far committed to sending Ukraine 16 Mi-17 helicopters, it has not directly sent aircraft to Ukraine and has described a plan to send Soviet-made Mig-29 jets from other countries - such as Poland - to Ukraine as untenable. Read more: What weapons has the US given Ukraine - and how much do they help? Russian forces have occupied 42 villages in the eastern Donetsk region today, an aide to President Volodymyr Zelensky's chief of staff has told national television. But the aide, Olena Symonenko. said Ukrainian forces might ""win them back tomorrow"". Russia is continuing its offensive in the Donbas, made up of Donetsk and Luhansk, attempting to expand its control within in the eastern regions. A US defence think tank said that Russian forces had made minor gains yesterday, taking parts of the key frontline towns of Rubizhne and Popasna. This video can not be played Ukraine's prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, has told the BBC about the scale and the types of the crimes she and her team have been investigating since the Russian invasion began. She said there were some places they still could not visit because it was not safe, but that they have seen huge numbers of civilian deaths and evidence of torture and sexual crimes. A Ukrainian soldier guards a school in Borodyanka Addressing a forum of the World Bank and IMF remotely, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Russia of threatening global food supplies with its invasion of Ukraine. Russia's blockade of Ukrainian Black Sea port cities has made it impossible for the country to export food supplies such as wheat, he said. Russia's war in Ukraine has seen food prices skyrocket in places that rely on grain exports from the country, such as Northern Africa. Zelensky added that Ukraine now needs approximately $7bn (Â£5.4bn) per month due to severe ""economic losses"" caused by the war. This is an increase from the $5bn Kyiv previously said was needed each month. He added that the ""Russian military are aimed at destroying all objects in Ukraine that can serve as an economic base for life. That includes railroad stations, food warehouses, [and] oil refineries."" So what does Putin's decision in Mariupol mean for the other theatres of conflict in Ukraine if the Donbas were to fall? It all depends on how the fight in the Donbas goes over the next two or three weeks, military expert Justin Crump says. ""That's why this period is so critical - based on that, you will either see a peace, a pause in conflict, or just a protracted ongoing war, and that depends on both sides of course,"" he says. Ultimately it will depend how well the Russians do against the Ukrainians there, he adds; it will define whether Putin settles for what he's got at that point, whether the Russians feel they've destroyed the heart of the Ukrainian military and showed Nato supplies aren't enough to hold them off - they can keep coming and take cities like Kharkiv. They still have 22 battlegroups north of Kyiv in Belarus, Crump says; they're being held there for a reason, Russia is keeping its options open for the rest of the country - but that could be very difficult if it loses a lot of forces in the Donbas, he adds. ""Mass burials of Mariupol residents killed by the Russian army"" aretaking place in a village nearby, the city council of the southern Ukrainian port says. In a statement, it says ""the occupiers are digging trenches about 30-metre (98ft) long and using dump lorries to bring the bodies"" to a site on the outskirts of the Manhush village, just to the west of the besieged city on the Sea of Azov coast. The Mariupol city council has posted an aerial photo purportedly showing the site, saying it ""is already twice as large as the nearby cemetery"". ""Almost 80 years ago, the Nazis shot dead 12,000 Mariupol residents in the village of Agrobaza. It is near Manhush. Not more than 13 km. History repeats itself again. Only instead of German fascists Russians have come,"" the statement says. The BBC has not independently verified the claim, and Russia has so far made no public comments on the issue. A photo by Mariupol's city council allegedly showing the site of mass grave (red square) near the city However, US technology company Maxar says that its recent high-resolution satellite imagery ""reveals the existence of a mass grave site on the north-western edge of Manhush, Ukraine (located approximately 20 km west of Mariupol) and adjacent to an existing village cemetery"". ""A review of our satellite images from mid-March through mid-April indicate that the expansion of the new set of graves began between 23-26 March, 2022, and has continued to expand over the past couple of weeks. ""The graves are aligned in four sections of linear rows (measuring approximately 85 metres per section) and contain more than 200 new graves,"" Maxar says. The American company has also posted a series of satellite images purportedly showing the expansion of a mass grave site near Mariupol. A satellite image of Maxar purportedly showing a mass grave site near Mariupol Paul AdamsDiplomatic Correspondent Western officials say they see some signs that Russia is addressing some of the problems that beset the early weeks of its invasion of Ukraine. The fact that they are trying to advance along a more narrow set of lines means that issues like command and control are better. But officials say the Russians are still operating in long convoys on single roads, which means they remain vulnerable to attack. Ukrainian troops, they say, âcontinue to fight in a very smart and very effective mannerâ. Some of the Russian lines of communication are still quite long (notably south from Kharkiv) and exposed to attack from the west. Officials say Vladimir Putin is âstill in a position to winâ, with a range of possible outcomes, none of which they expect to see happen quickly. The West is gearing up to sustain military support for Ukraine âthrough a prolonged period of conflictâ¦.perhaps much of the rest of this year"". A successful Russian campaign in the Donbas is possible and, in a worst case scenario, this could lead the Russians to revisit some of their pre-war objectives, such as Kyiv and Odesa. Officials say that Russian forces enjoy a roughly three to one advantage in numbers over the Ukrainian military, but much depends on how smartly Moscow uses those forces and what capabilities the Ukrainian defenders have - hence the push by the West to send even more advanced equipment. Russia still has large numbers of troops - between 5,000 and 10,000 - in the area around Mariupol, which means that there has been little or no movement on the southern side of Russiaâs expected pincer movement against Ukrainian forces in the Donbas. Officials say that if Putin wants to seal off Mariupol, this will not be a trivial task and will continue to limit the ability of those forces to take part in operations in the Donbas. Officials note that Russiaâs use of long-range Iskander missiles has slowed somewhat in the past week, suggesting Moscow has concerns about usage rates and the ability to restock. Aiden Aslin (pictured) and Shaun Pinner were both serving as marines in Ukraine's military We've heard todayfrom Russia's foreign ministry about the two British fightersreportedly captured by Russian forces while fighting in Ukraine. ""Don't worry, the Russian side is taking care of them,"" said ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova in a message on Telegram. ""They are fed, watered, and given the necessary assistance, just like other foreigners who have surrendered or been detained."" Shaun Pinner, 48, and Aiden Aslin, 28,were shown in two separate videos on Russian TV on Monday,asking to be exchanged with a pro-Russian politician held in Ukraine. It was not clear whether their requests were made under duress. Both had been living in Ukraine before it was invaded, have Ukrainian partners and had been serving as marines in Ukraine's military. Russia says they were taken prisoner in the southern city of Mariupol. Aslin's family said on Wednesday the video of him was""deeply distressing""and condemned ""Russian propaganda"". In comments addressed to UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Zakharova said: ""Don't pretend to be worried. You have absolutely no interest in the fate of the British in trouble. They did not have fun with you at parties in Downing Street."" Three school buses filled with people escaping from the besieged southern city of Mariupol have arrived in the city of Zaporizhzhia further west. Only 79 people were able to travel on the convoy because of the difficulties in setting up humanitarian corridors, Ukrainian officials said People crossed through territory held by Russian forces to get to safety There were emotional scenes as people met relatives and friends at a registration centre for internally displaced people in Zaporizhzhia The convoy was carrying people from Mariupol, Melitopol and surrounding towns under Russian control  If you're just joining our live coverage, here are the latest developments on the war in Ukraine:  Of the 71,800 Ukrainian refugees who have been granted visas, only 21,600 have actually arrived
in the UK, government figures show. This may be because some are still waiting for
their family membersâ applications to be approved, or they have decided to stay somewhere closer to Ukraine. The visas were issued under the Ukraine Family
Scheme - which Ukrainians with a family member in the UK can apply for - and
the Homes for Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme - which allows people already living
in the UK to host Ukrainian refugees known to them. The Homes for Ukraine scheme has been widely criticised because of delays, withHome
Secretary Priti Patel apologisingfor the âfrustratingâ lags in the scheme. Processing delays mean some Ukrainian refugees wait almost
three weeks for their visas to be approved. In an email to those registered in the scheme, the government acknowledged the âunacceptableâ delays and explained they were now ""working to accelerate the award of visas
under Homes for Ukraine"". Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.99999857
"Russia says it has destroyed six substations powering Ukrainian railways used to transport foreign weapons Ukraine's armed forces say Russia is targeting rail junctions to hit military supply routes At least five people in central Ukraine were killed in the attacks, Ukrainian officials say About 15,000 Russian troops have been killed since Russia invaded Ukraine, UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace says US Secretary of State Antony Blinken says Russia is trying to brutalise parts of Ukraine but failing in its war aims He was speaking after meeting President Zelensky in Kyiv on Sunday US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin, who also went to Kyiv, said the US wanted to see Russia militarily weakened Edited by Jude Sheerin Theo LeggettBBC International Business Correspondent Global military spending exceeded $2tn (Â£1.6tn) for the first time in 2021, with Russia's increased significantly, a new report says. It was the seventh year in which the total had risen, the report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute said. The rise in military spending is set to continue, as European countries build up their armed forces in response to Russiaâs invasion of Ukraine. The US spent more than $800bn on its military last year, more than double that of any other country. Russia increased its military spending by nearly 3%, helped by higher oil and gas revenues, as it built up its forces on the Ukrainian border. Finland and Sweden are gearing up to announce at the same time in May that they want to join Nato, Finnish and Swedish tabloids have reported. Both countries are militarily non-aligned but Russia's invasion of Ukraine has prompted increasing public support for joining the Western defensive alliance. Finnish newspaper Iltalehti says it believes the leaders of Finland and Sweden plan to meet in the week of 16 May and then announce that they will apply to join Nato. Finnish Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto declined to comment. The Swedish tabloid Aftonbladet, citing unnamed sources, also said it believed the two countries would make announcements that week, at the same time as each other. Russia has warned of a nuclear build-up in the Baltic should Finland and Sweden join Nato. Reality Check A MiG-29 on display at an air base in india India has been under pressure to help isolate Russia after its invasion of Ukraine. But it has long-standing defence ties to Moscow. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, visiting the US, has said that while India would like to be a âgood friendâ to Western countries, it needed to protect its interests and ensure its security. Data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri), shows that India is one of the worldâs largest buyers of weapons. And since 1992, about two-thirds of its military equipment has come from Russia. It has diversified its sources of weapons in recent years, buying more equipment from other countries. But if you look at the period from 2016 to 2021, Russia continued to be by far the largest supplier of weapons to India, accounting for twice as much as the next biggest supplier, France. Alina Kabaeva is a 38-year old Olympic gold medalist White House press secretary Jen Psaki denied at Monday's daily press briefing the US was deliberately holding off on sanctioning the woman believed to be Putin's girlfriend. ""We're continuing to review sanctions,"" Psaki said when asked why Russian politician and ex-gymnast Alina Kabaeva had not yet been targeted. ""No-one is safe from our sanctions,"" Psaki continued. ""We've already of course sanctioned President Putin, but also his daughter and his closest cronies, and we will continue to review more,"" she added. Calls have been rising for the US to sanction the 38-year old Olympic gold medalist, as the US has done to Putin's two adult daughters. Putin is known for being intensely private about his personal life, and has never acknowledged any romantic relationship with Russia's ""secret first lady"", as she has been dubbed in the Russian and foreign press. According to a Wall Street Journal report, US officials have withheld sanctions on Kabaeva due to concerns that Putin would view it as a personal attack. It would be viewed as ""so personal a blow to Mr Putin that it could further escalate tensions between Russia and the US"", the Journal wrote. An railway electricity substation near Lviv was damaged in a Russian strike aimed at halting the supply of foreign weapons If you're just joining us, here's a round-up of the latest events in Ukraine.  Lavrov also acknowledged there's a possibility of the conflict escalating to nuclear weapons, though he also sounded a hopeful note about the prospects of a peace accord. Speaking to the Russian First Channel on Monday, he said Moscow wanted to avoid ""artificially"" elevated risks of such a conflict. ""This is our key position on which we base everything. The risks now are considerable,"" Lavrov said. ""I would not want to elevate those risks artificially. Many would like that. The danger is serious, real, And we must not underestimate it."" Lavrov also accused President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine of ""pretending"" to negotiate, calling him ""a good actorâ. ""If you watch attentively and read attentively what he says, you'll find a thousand contradictions,"" Russiaâs top diplomat said. The foreign minister said last week that Moscow was committed to avoiding a nuclear war. On Monday, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted that Lavrovâs latest comments were an indication Russia had lost its ""last hope to scare the world off supporting Ukraineâ. ""Thus the talk of a ârealâ danger of WWIII. This only means Moscow senses defeat in Ukraine,"" he tweeted. Days after the invasion began back on 24 February, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his nuclear forces to be on alert. The US and its Nato allies have said they do not want direct military intervention in Ukraine, in order to avoid the risks of a Third World War. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has said deliveries of Western weaponry to Ukraine mean that the Nato alliance is ""in essence engaged in war with Russiaâ. In an interview aired on Monday, he said: ""These weapons will be a legitimate target for Russiaâs military acting within the context of the special operation.â Lavrov also told state television: ""Nato, in essence, is engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy. War means war."" In his nightly video address to the nation, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says that Ukraine's victory is inevitable, but it is impossible to predict when the war will conclude. ""Many cities and communities are still under the temporary control of the Russian army,"" he says in his address. ""But I have no doubt that it is only a matter of time before we liberate our land."" Earlier in his address, he marked the fact that the invasion, which began on 24 February, has just surpassed the three-month mark. Zelensky goes on to say that there is ""no simple answer"" to the question of when Ukraine will defeat the Russians, adding that victory - and peace - will come more quickly if every Ukrainian fights. ""When we gain a victory, everyone will feel it. When peace comes, everyone will see it. ""But for this to happen - and happen faster - we need to think not about when and what it will be. We must think every day about how to make the stay of the occupiers on our land even more unbearable."" ""For Russia to seek peace, every Ukrainian must still fight,"" he continues. ""They must defend freedom. Because every day of struggle now adds years of peaceful life after this war. After our victory."" This ambulance was one of 20 donated earlier this month to the war-torn country The UK is donating 22 new ambulances and medical equipment to Ukraine following a request from the government there, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has announced. It comes just weeks after a shipment of 20 ambulances was sent to the country, as it battles against the Russian invasion. Medical aid charity UK-Med, which works on the front line of disasters around the world, has been given Â£300,000 of funding to train Ukrainian doctors, nurses and paramedics in dealing with mass casualties. The charity has also been given Â£300,000 of medicines and other pharmaceutical supplies to bring to Ukrainian medical staff. More than 40 fire engines have already arrived in Ukraine from the UK, after the nation saw more than 100 of its fire stations and 250 fire engines destroyed in the war. Steve RosenbergRussia editor, reporting from Bryansk Plumes of smoke were captured rising into the sky from the oil depot in Bryansk on a video on social media The city of Bryansk is a hundred miles from Russiaâs border
with Ukraine. But today it looked like it was on the front line. Plumes of
thick black smoke dominated the skyline - the consequence of fires overnight.
First one fuel depot erupting in flames, and then another. The cause? Well, thereâs been no official explanation - there
is, however, much speculation. Was this the result of a Ukrainian strike to
disrupt logistics for Russiaâs military offensive? Was it sabotage by Russian
opponents of the Kremlinâs so-called special military operation? Neither Moscow
nor Kyiv is saying. Whatever the cause, the fires have sparked concern amongst
the Russian public. Here are some of the things people told me on the streets
of Bryansk: âThis never happened before. At 3am we heard explosions.
Weâre amazed.â âI donât know what this is. Is it war here? Well, I suppose
weâre on the front line. I wonder if Ukraine did this..?â We have seen something similar in Belgorod, earlier this
month. Another blaze at another Russian fuel depot near the border. Russia
claimed Ukrainian helicopter gunships had opened fire. Kyiv wouldnât confirm
it. But one thing is clear. Despite President Putinâs claims
that he sent his troops into Ukraine to bring Russians security, there is
little sign of that. Electronic equipment which could be used to intercept communications and spy on Ukrainians is the latest category of products to be banned by the UK for export to Russia. The Department for International Trade also announced the UK would remove tariffs and quotes on products from Ukraine, responding to a request from President Volodymyr Zelensky to support the country's economy as it defends itself from invasion. The decision would affect key Ukrainian exports such as barley, honey, tinned tomatoes and poultry, the UK said. Tariffs will be lifted for 12 months initially, but could be extended. As well as equipment used to intercept and monitor communications, the UK has previously banned the export of luxury goods, aviation and space equipment, oil refining items and advanced technologies such as quantum computing. Jonathan BealeDefence correspondent, reporting from Donbas Lieutenant Denys Gordeev is used to war, but not like this. ""It's become much harder,"" he says. ""We have bomb attacks, rocket attacks every day, all the time, every hour."" Though he has spent eight years battling Russian-backed separatists in the Donbas, now he and his men are facing the full might of the Russian army. After its retreat from Kyiv three weeks ago, Russia has refocused its military efforts in Eastern Ukraine - with its goal of taking the whole of the Donbas region. It has redeployed many of its units to the east. Western officials estimate that Russia now has about 76 Battalion Tactical Groups in the region - each of which has about 800 men. They also say there's some evidence Russia's been addressing some of its early mistakes, helped by the fact they're now fighting on fewer fronts, and under a unified command. The result is that Ukrainian forces are struggling to hold a 300-mile front in the Donbas. They've already lost ground to the Russians and are likely to lose more in the days ahead. Russian forces have been conducting probing attacks to find weak points in Ukraine's defences. For now the invading army is mostly using its artillery and rockets to grind down Ukraine's defences. Some military analysts expect a major assault is still to come. And Ukrainian forces, including Lt Gordeev and his unit, appear to be holding the line, although Western experts say they are already outnumbered three to one. Read the full report here. Now some news from Kherson, the only major city that Russian forces have taken and continued to occupy. Its Ukrainian mayor, Ihor Kolykhayev, has reported on Facebook that Russian armed men took control of the city council building on Monday. Although Kherson has been under Russian occupation since early March, the city council had still been functioning under Ukrainian control. Kolykhayev said the Russian military took away the keys to the building and exchanged the security guards for guards of their own. He said he left the building at 19.45 local time. Pravda, a Ukrainian news outlet, reported that from 26 April, Kherson city council would not be functioning. It added that the mayor and employees of the city council were given the chance to go home. Adam EastonWarsaw Correspondent Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki has said his government has sent tanks to Ukraine. During an interview with private broadcaster Polsat News, Morawiecki was asked if Poland has sent, or will send, tanks to Ukraine. He replied ""yes"", without giving further details. He said he would announce more information âin due courseâ but for the time being he wouldn't reveal how many tanks have been supplied for security reasons. For several weeks now, itâs been rumoured that Poland has been supplying Ukraine with Soviet-era T-72 tanks. The Ministry of Defence had refused to comment on the rumours. Morawiecki said that the matter of Poland supplying Ukraine with Soviet-era MiG-29 fighter jets is now âclosedâ. In March, Poland said it was ready to deploy the jets to the US Ramstein Air Base in Germany and put them at the disposal of the US military, but Washington rejected the offer. âThere is no such necessity, there are no such demands, no such requests,â he said, when asked if sending planes to Ukraine was still being considered. Several explosions have hit the state security ministry in the breakaway Moldovan region of Transnistria, the interior ministry said on its Telegram channel. The ministry said the building appeared to have been hit with rocket-propelled grenades, but it said no one was injured. It comes days after a Russian general suggested Moscow wanted totake full control of southern Ukraine, giving Russia access to the separatist region of Moldova which it supports. He said there was ""oppression of the Russian-speaking population"" in Transnistria, a claim which had also been made - without evidence - to justify the invasion of Ukraine. Ukraine's defence ministry saidthe incident was a ""planned provocation"" by Russia itself to instil ""panic and anti-Ukrainian sentiment"",external. A small Russian-speaking breakaway region, Transnistria borders Ukraine from the west. It claimed independence after the fall of the Soviet Union in a bloody conflict, but is not recognised internationally and officially remains part of Moldova. A senior Russian diplomat has said a ceasefire is not a good option at the moment, because it will give Ukrainian forces the chance to ""regroup and to stage more provocations"". Earlier today, Russia announced that it would be holding a ceasefire around the steelworks in the besieged city of Mariupol from 14:00 local time (11:00 GMT), to allow civilians to leave. But Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said no agreement had been reached and called for written security guarantees. Russia's first deputy permanent representative to the UN, Dmitry Polyanskiy, said Ukraine had claimed that there were some civilians in the Azovstal steel plant, where the last Ukrainian fighters in the city are holed up, but Ukrainian forces ""did not let them go"". He went on to say that Russia had not attacked residential areas in Odesa, Ukraine's Black Sea port city, over the weekend. On Saturday, Ukraine said that two missiles struck a military facility and two residential buildings in the city. But Polyanskiy said the residential buildings were hit by Ukraine air defences. He went on to reject the comments made by US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, who said Russia had failed to achieve its aims in the invasion. Polyanskiy said: ""I don't think we failed, frankly."" He added that Russia is conducting its ""military operation"" and it has ""its own aims"" and ""its own strategies"". Nikita, Oleksandr and Vira have been living in a succession of temporary lodgings as they wait for news of a visa A disabled teenaged refugee from Ukraine and his grandparents have been stuck in Paris for more than six weeks as they wait for their UK visa application to be processed. Kateryna Karpenko persuaded her nephew Nikita Shepel, and her parents Oleksandr and Vira, to flee Russian shelling and apply to come to join her in the UK, where she has lived for almost 10 years. But amid complaints that the UK Home Office has conducted a chaotic and overly-bureaucratic response to the Ukrainian refugee crisis, the estimated five working day wait for a visa has turned into more than a month in limbo, costing them thousands of pounds in accommodation. ""They had to go through a lot, fleeing Ukraine, and they have no idea what's happening with our home, our family, our lives,"" says Kateryna. A UK government spokesman said changes the Home Office has made to the system, including simpler forms and increase staff numbers, are working. Read more  US President Joe Biden has named the veteran diplomat Bridget Brink as the new US ambassador to Ukraine. Earlier today, the White House announced that Brink would be moving to fill ""a crucial position"", which has been vacant for the past three years. Washington said Brink's appointment came at a time when the US was ramping up its support for Ukraine, amid Russia's invasion. The new ambassador is currently serving as the US ambassador to Slovakia and has been a diplomat for 25 years. The White House added that Brink's ""decades of
experience make her uniquely suited for this moment in Ukraineâs
history"". A firefighter surveys the damage at an electricity substation powering the railway near Lviv We've been bringing you updates on the reports of attacks on railway infrastructure in Ukraine, which Ukrainian officials say killed five people. Earlier, Ukraine said Russia was trying to disrupt supply lines for military equipment from foreign countries. Now Russia has confirmed that was the purpose of the attacks, according to Reuters. The news agency is citing a statement from the Russian defence ministry, saying its missiles destroyed six facilities powering the railways that were used to supply Ukrainian forces with weapons from abroad. Ukrainian officials said five railway stations in the centre and west of the country came under attack within an hour this morning. An electricity substation powering overhead lines in Krasne, near Lviv, was also hit in a missile strike. Ukraine's defence minister has thanked the US for their military assistance - describing the relationship between the two nation's as as a ""true brotherhood"". Oleksii Reznikov's comments on Twitter follow the visit to Kyiv on Sunday by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. Mr Reznikov said the support given by the Biden administration is ""not measured in money, but in the saved lives of Ukrainians"". During the visit, it was announced that US diplomats will begin returning to Ukraine and the Washington will provide Ukraine with a further $700m in military aid. Mr Reznikov also shared a video where he can be seen shaking hands and embracing Austin, accompanied by the caption: ""This is more than partnership of state officials - this is true brotherhood.""

"The moment Saint West shows his mother the Roblox sex tape room he apparently found A reality show scene where Kim Kardashian's son finds an advert for a sex tape on the game Roblox was not faked, a source close to the star says. In the scene, Saint West, six, shows his mother a ""Kim Kardashian experience"" room he apparently stumbled across while playing the game. Roblox said it removed the room and banned its creator - and no sex tape was ever available. It also said only ""a few dozen players"" found it in the short time it was live. On social media and in some news reports, people have suggested the chances of Saint West being one of those who found it are slim. One well known independent Roblox developer known as Zomebody told BBC News: ""The chances of 'accidentally' stumbling upon a game like that are astronomically small. ""There are two potential ways for Saint to have found such a game - either he or the family actively searched for (or even created) such a game or someone else in their group of peers created it and then shared it directly with the boy."" Neither the Kardashians nor the production company, Fulwell 73, provided an on-the-record comment but a source close to the family insisted the scene was not falsified. Kim Kardashian sued in crypto 'pump and dump' case Kim Kardashian West joins billionaires' club Fifty million players worldwide log in to Roblox every day to explore, play mini-games and create their own experiences. There are millions of player-generated experiences and mini games, with new features added daily. The most popular experiences are showcased to Roblox players through a curated home screen but others can be found using the search function. The vast majority of these zones are not advertised to players and do not receive many visitors. The moment Saint West finds the Roblox room is a central driver of the drama in the first episode of the new show, The Kardashians, a reboot of the long-running Keeping Up With the Kardashians reality show. He is seen running up to his mother, saying: ""Everybody look it, this is on Roblox,"" before handing her his tablet computer. Kim Kardashian has thanked fans for the success of the first episode of her new show The tablet screen is blurred but Kim Kardashian describes what she saw to an interviewer: ""There was a picture of my cry face and I look at it and it said something super-inappropriate like, 'Kim's new sex tape'. This is supposed to be unreleased footage from my old sex tape."" A sex tape of Kim Kardashian was published online in 2007. Later in the episode, using strong language, she threatens to sue Roblox telling her lawyer she has ""all the time, all the money and all the resources to burn them to the... ground"". Roblox, which is valued at about $24bn (Â£18bn), said it took action against the content as soon as its moderators were alerted in September 2021. The show aired on Hulu in the US and Disney+ elsewhere, last week. There is no public record of a lawsuit filed against the company. A Roblox spokesman said: ""The text reference to the tape that got around our filters was quickly taken down and fortunately visible only to a few dozen people on the platform. We also swiftly took down the associated experience and banned the community developer involved with the incident."" Roblox would not say who had created the room, exactly how many players had entered it before it had been removed or how the company had been notified about it. Hulu, which did not respond to requests for comment, celebrated the success of the show, which had the biggest US premiere in the streaming service's history.

"The world faces a ""human catastrophe"" from a food crisis arising from Russia's invasion of Ukraine, World Bank president David Malpass has said. He told the BBC that record rises in food prices would push hundreds of millions people into poverty and lower nutrition, if the crisis continues. The World Bank calculates there could be a ""huge"" 37% jump in food prices. This would hit the poor hardest, who will ""eat less and have less money for anything else such as schooling"". In an interview with BBC economics editor Faisal Islam, Mr Malpass, who leads the institution charged with global alleviation of poverty, said the impact on the poor made it ""an unfair kind of crisis... that was true also of Covid"". ""It's a human catastrophe, meaning nutrition goes down. But then it also becomes a political challenge for governments who can't do anything about it, they didn't cause it and they see the prices going up,"" he said on the sidelines of the IMF-World Bank meetings in Washington. Ukraine war causes 'giant leap' in food prices Ukraine war 'catastrophic for global food' The price rises are broad and deep, he said: ""It's affecting food of all different kinds oils, grains, and then it gets into other crops, corn crops, because they go up when wheat goes up"". There was enough food in the world to feed everybody, he said, and global stockpiles are large by historical standards, but there will have to be a sharing or sales process to get the food to where it is needed. Mr Malpass also discouraged countries from subsidising production or capping prices. Instead, he said, the focus needed to be on increasing supplies across the world of fertilisers and food, alongside targeted assistance for the very poorest people. The World Bank chief also warned of a knock on ""crisis within a crisis"" arising from the inability of developing countries to service their large pandemic debts, amid rising food and energy prices. ""This is a very real prospect. It's happening for some countries, we don't know how far it'll go. As many as 60% of the poorest countries right now are either in debt distress or at high risk of being in debt distress,"" he said. ""We have to be worried about a debt crisis, the best thing to do is to start early to act early on finding ways to reduce the debt burden for countries that are on have unsustainable debt, the longer you put it off, the worse it is,"" he added. The acknowledgement by the World Bank president that we have to be worried about a developing country debt crisis, is very significant. The combination of massive pandemic debts with rising interest rates, and rising prices is truly toxic. The talk on the sidelines here at the IMF and World Bank meetings is that the rich countries told emerging economies not to worry about borrowing in order to spend to help suppress the pandemic. Now those countries are wondering if these record debts will be written off. Campaigning groups are preparing mobilisations over a pandemic debt jubilee. But there is silence from the rich country lenders, so far. And there is a very new dynamic these days. The bankers to whom these sums are owed are no longer just in the West. China is now, very broadly, owed as much as the entire collection of Western creditors known as the Paris Club. How will it respond to calls for leniency on the repayment of loans? Mr Malpass says of China: ""They have different rules, for example, contracts that have non-disclosure clauses, meaning you can't share the terms with other people that makes it very hard to restructure those debts"". China has also secured its lending against ports and natural resources. Sri Lanka is a case in point right now. The unwinding of all of this might not be orderly, and could have significant geopolitical consequences. Earlier this month, the United Nations said that the Ukraine war had led to a ""giant leap"" in food prices, as they hit a new record high in March. It came as the war cut off supplies from the world's biggest exporter of sunflower oil and the cost of alternatives climbed. Ukraine is also a major producer of cereals such as maize and wheat which have risen sharply in price too. The UN said ""war in the Black Sea region spread shocks through markets for staple grains and vegetable oils"". The UN Food Prices Index tracks the world's most-traded food commodities - measuring the average prices of cereal, vegetable oil, dairy, meat, and sugar. Food prices are at their highest since records began 60 years ago, according to the index, after they jumped nearly 13% in March, following February's record high. Food commodity prices were already at 10-year highs before the war in Ukraine, according to the index, because of global harvest issues.
