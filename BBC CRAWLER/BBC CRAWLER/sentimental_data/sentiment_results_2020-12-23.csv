"Ex-Prime Minister Tony Blair is urging the government to give as many people as possible an initial dose of a Covid vaccine - rather than preserving stocks so there is enough for second jabs. The Pfizer-Biontech and Oxford University-Astrazeneca vaccines require two doses to be fully effective. Mr Blair said his idea would speed up the vaccine programme so the country could come out of lockdown sooner. In the Independent,,externalhe argued the roll-out must be ""radically accelerated"". The UK has pre-ordered 40 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and 100 million of the Oxford University Astrazeneca vaccines. More than 500,000 people in the UK have now been given their first dose of the vaccine. The two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine are administered around 21 days apart. In a statement, Pfizer said this was needed ""to provide the maximum protection"", adding: ""Health professionals are advised to continue to follow the official guidance on administration of the vaccine."" How will the UK vaccinate millions of people? Covid jab 'very likely' to protect against variant 'Common sense' to move toward digital IDs - Blair Mr Blair told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that although ""you really need the two dosesâ¦ the first dose gives you substantial immunity"". He argued there was a ""strong case for not holding back the second doses of the vaccine"" and instead using those batches to give a greater number of people the first dose. His proposal was backed up by Professor David Salisbury, the man in charge of immunisation at the Department of Health until 2013. He told Today the numbers were ""straightforward"". ""You give one dose you get 91% [protection] you give two doses and you get 95% - you are only gaining 4% for giving the second dose,"" he said. ""With current circumstances, I would strongly urge you to use as many first doses as you possibly can for risk groups and only after you have done all of that come back with second doses."" However, he acknowledged this would be harder to do with the Oxford University vaccine, where the efficacy of two doses is 60%. Pfizer has not tested their vaccine as a single dose so where have the numbers come from? The large clinical trial using two jabs showed 52% protection in the time between the first and second jabs. But it takes time for the immune system to fully respond, so that figure will include the time when there is no protection from the vaccine. And this is true of the second jab; it's not an instantaneous response. Data in the New England Journal of Medicine,externalsays there is 90.5% protection in the six days after the second jab. Prof Salisbury's argument is this is all down to the first jab, as the second has not kicked in yet. Professor Wendy Barclay, from the department of infectious disease at Imperial College London, said Mr Blair's idea was interesting but agreed it was ""too risky"" to try without further evidence. And Professor Neil Ferguson, also from Imperial, added that the UK regulator had authorised the vaccine on the basis that people would receive two doses. Administering one dose only would require ""an entirely different regulatory submission"", he told a Commons committee. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""Over the coming weeks and months, the rate of vaccinations will increase as more doses become available and the programme continues to expand."" Margaret Keenan became the first person in the UK to receive the Pfizer/BioNtech Covid-19 vaccine at University Hospital, Coventry Mr Blair's suggestion is part of a seven-point plan he has drawn up, which also includes a plea to the government to start preparing ""health passports"". The former Labour prime minister, who was in power between 1997 and 2007, predicted that in six months, countries would only allow travellers to visit if they could give proof of their disease status. He also said it was important to ""have the best data systems in the world available to us"". ""Collecting this data in one place, with one patient record, is going to be absolutely vital - testing, vaccinations, every single thing to do with the development of this disease,"" he added. ""You need to record every single piece of data you can lay your hands on because we will be adjusting our vaccination programme as we go - we may even have to adjust the vaccine itself."" Mr Blair also said that while it was important to prioritise the vulnerable and health care staff, this should not delay vaccinating those who were more likely to spread the disease, such as students. Tony Blair's theory about making vaccines go further is grabbing the headlines but the former prime minister's thoughts on health passports could prove even more controversial. He's confident that within six months no country in the world will allow travellers in without proof of their disease status - and wants the UK government to get ahead of the curve, building a vast database of patient records, tests and vaccinations. It would seem inevitable that any health passport would end up being used not just for foreign travel but at home, with restaurants, shops and even employers demanding to know about an individual's virus status. The national ID card that Tony Blair's government proposed in the teeth of fierce opposition would finally become a reality. But civil liberties and data rights campaigners have already raised concerns about issues such as the data collected by the NHS Covid-19 contact tracing app, and about the role in building a virus dashboard thegovernment has given to the controversial American firm Palantir. They can be expected to mount a vigorous fight against any attempt to create a national ""Covid passport"" - and many MPs across the political spectrum will share their unease. But not everyone will reject the idea out of hand. Some whose freedoms to leave their house or to welcome family at Christmas have been curtailed may think that giving away some of their data is a price worth paying for a return to normality.

"Buckingham Palace's Masterpieces exhibition was forced to shut after less than two weeks The two men in charge of the Queen's art collection have left and won't be replaced ""for the time being"" because of Covid's impact on royal finances. Desmond Shawe-Taylor, the Surveyor of The Queen's Pictures - a post that was created in 1625 - has taken redundancy. Rufus Bird, the Surveyor of The Queen's Works of Art, has also left. The Royal Collection Trust has said it expects to lose Â£64m in income this year because Buckingham Palace and other sites have been shut to visitors. That has forced the Trust, one of the the royal household's five departments, into carrying out a restructure and staff cuts. Writing inthe Trust's latest annual report,external, the Prince of Wales, its chairman, said: ""We are now facing by far the greatest challenge in the charity's history and have had to take many hard decisions in order to adjust to the new economic realities."" The Trust looks after the Queen's vast and distinguished art collection, which includes masterpieces by Vermeer, Rembrandt, Van Dyck, Rubens, Titian and Reynolds. The post of Surveyor of The Queen's Pictures was created by Charles I, and previous holders include Anthony Blunt, who was later revealed to have been a Russian spy. Mr Shawe-Taylor had been in the job since 2005. The Trust is also responsible for opening the Queen's official residences to visitors. Its latest exhibition, Masterpieces from Buckingham Palace, opened on 4 December but was forced to close less than two weeks later, when London's coronavirus restrictions were tightened. A statement from the Trust said: ""As part of the Royal Collection Trust restructure, Desmond Shawe-Taylor, Surveyor of The Queen's Pictures and Chief Surveyor, and Rufus Bird, Surveyor of The Queen's Works of Art, will leave the organisation under the Voluntary Severance Programme. ""The posts of Surveyor of The Queen's Pictures and Surveyor of The Queen's Works of Art will for the time being, be lost and held in abeyance.

"McLaughlan completed the 25-mile journey on 11 December A man who rode from Scotland to the Isle of Man by jet ski to see his girlfriend has left the island by ferry upon his release from jail. Dale McLaughlan made the four-and-a-half hour crossing from the Isle of Whithorn to Ramsey on 11 December. He then walked another 15 miles (25km) to his girlfriend's home in Douglas. The 28-year-old - who served part of afour-week sentencefor the Covid-19 border control breach - told the BBC he was ""happy to be going home"". Under current Isle of Man coronavirus laws McLaughlan, from Irvine in North Ayrshire, was required to leave the island after his release or face further prosecution. Speaking toIsle of Man Newspapers,external, his girlfriend Jessica Radcliffe said: ""I don't understand why he's been told to leave when he's isolated for two weeks before he came over with a negative test. ""He had a negative test in jail, he didn't put any of the public at risk, and he's done isolation in jail. ""That's four weeks already, so why does he need to leave the island? To punish him this much, they shouldn't be doing that."" McLaughlan was arrested two days after his arrival, having spent time mixing with people in two busy nightclubs, his court case heard. Douglas Courthouse heard it was the first time he had used a jet ski. Only non-residents given special permission are currently allowed to enter the island. McLaughlan's defence advocate said he suffered from depression and was not coping with being unable to see his partner.

"A child under the age of one has died with Covid-19 in Scotland, official figures show. The death of the baby girl is the youngest Covid death in Scotland and the only one under the age of 15. National Records of Scotland (NRS) counts all death certificates that mention Covid-19, even if the person has not been tested for the virus. The baby's death was registered between 14 and 20 December along with 202 others that week. Scotland passes 6,000 deaths from Covid-19 In total, 6,298 death certificates in Scotland have mentioned Covid-19 since the outbreak began in March. About 75% of all these deaths are of people aged 75 or over, with 15% in the 65-74 age group. The latest NRS figures,externalalso show that the total number of ""excess deaths"" in 2020 is now the highest for at least 40 years. Excess deaths are counted above an average from the last five years. There have been 62,415 deaths from all causes so far this year, compared with a five-year average of 57,760 - an excess of 4,655. There were 58,108 deaths in Scotland last year, with 1,122 excess deaths. Since the first Covid-19 deaths were registered in Scotland on 17 March there have been 6,399 excess deaths, but the number of deaths in the first weeks of 2020 was below average which makes the overall figure lower.

Deepfake technology can be used to create convincing yet entirely fictional video content, and is often used to spread misinformation. In the message, the deepfake will try its hand at a TikTok viral dance challenge. The five-minute message will refer to a number of controversial topics, including the decision by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex to leave the UK. It will also allude to the Duke of York's decision to step down from royal duties earlier this year after an interview he gave to the BBC about his relationship with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The BBC's royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell was not impressed: ""There have been countless imitations of the Queen. This isn't a particularly good one. ""The voice sounds what it is - a rather poor attempt to impersonate her. What makes it troubling is the use of video technology to attempt to sync her lips to the words being spoken."" This video can not be played WATCH: Channel 4 says its deepfake video of the Queen is meant to act as a warning Some members of the public have also suggested the video is ""disrespectful"" via posts on social media. The media watchdog Ofcom said it had received ""a small number of complaints"", but because it is a post-transmission regulator could not consider them at this time. While current technology does allow for voice deepfakes, the voice of this deepfake will be dubbed by British actress Debra Stephenson. The TV star was previously the voice of a puppet of the monarch in the 2020 revival of satirical sketch show Spitting Image. Stephenson said: ""As an actress it is thrilling but it is also terrifying if you consider how this could be used in other contexts."" The deepfake has been created by Oscar-winning VFX studio Framestore. Deepfakes first rose to prominence in early 2018. At the time, a developer adapted cutting-edge artificial intelligence techniques to create software that swapped one person's face for another. However, the process has since become much more accessible. There are now numerous apps that require just a single photo in order to substitute a Hollywood actor for that of the user. Earlier this year, Microsoft unveiled a tool that can spot deepfakes. The firm said it hoped to help combat disinformation, but experts warned it was at risk of becoming outdated due to advances in technology. Nina Schick, author of Deep Fakes and the Infocalypse, told the BBC there was growing concern about the other malicious ways deepfake technology could be used. ""While it offers tremendous commercial and creative opportunities, transforming entire industries from entertainment to communication, it is also a technology that will be weaponised. ""Used maliciously, AI-generated synthetic media, or deepfakes, are sophisticated forms of visual disinformation."" The Alternative Christmas Message will be shown on Channel 4 at 15:25 GMT on 25 December. Deepfake videos: Can you really believe what you see?

"Truckers have been stranded in Kent since France imposed a cross-Channel travel ban Teams of volunteers have delivered hundreds of meals to lorry drivers stranded in Kent. Members of Maidenhead's KhalsaAid travelled 80 miles (130km) to take food to drivers hit by the travel ban between the UK and France. On Tuesday, some of the Sikh charity's LangarAid members travelled almost double the distance, from Coventry, to take water and food. KhalsaAid founder Ravi Singh said: ""Everyone's working together."" Volunteers from KhalsaAid provided more than 800 meals to stuck truckers Rail, air and sea services between the two countrieshave resumedafter France eased its travel ban. French citizens, British nationals living in France and hauliers are among those now able to travel - if they have a recent negative test. But the delays will take some time to clear, with drivers remaining in need of help from the armies of volunteers. Hungarian volunteers deliver donations to drivers in Ashford Some European nationals living in England have come to the aid of their compatriots who are stranded in Kent. Members of aFacebook page for Hungarians in the UK,externalhelped to organise food donations. Ivett Hidvegi said drivers were ""in a really bad situation"" with limited access to food and toilets. Volunteers were prevented from delivering food at Manston Airport on Tuesday, so handed donations to drivers on the roadside, she said. Extra toilets were delivered to Manston Airport on Wednesday Sikhs from Guru Nanak Gurdwara in Gravesend, Kent, helped cook the meals before volunteers were given a police escort along the M20 to deliver them. Mr Singh added: ""It's horrible for [the drivers], there's nothing here - no food, no shops - it's like a prison for them. We can't sit back and do nothing."" The Salvation Army has been giving out food and drink to drivers stuck on the M20 The Salvation Army has also provided 1,000 packs of sandwiches for lorry drivers on the M20. Capt Marion Rouffet said: ""We worked from 8:30 last night until midnight, and the sandwiches were stored by the pub next door. ""The shop owner next door offered anything we need, and Pret A Manger gave us lots of sandwich fillings. ""People will always rally when necessary."" Ramsgate FC was giving out pizzas to drivers as they arrived at Manston Airport Elsewhere, Ramsgate Football Club delivered 200 pizzas to stranded drivers. ""We are a community club and we want anyone in the community or who passes through to know we will always look after them,"" chairman James Lawson said. ""We gave pizzas to the lorry drivers as they were driving into Manston Airport. We have a pizza kitchen and we can't play football at the moment, so we had a lot of stock which was starting to go out of date, so it seemed a perfect opportunity to help out. ""It was a lot of work over a few hours,"" he said. Ashford International Truckstop said it was providing 1,000 food bags, prepared by staff who had volunteered to work at its sister hotel in Hythe and pub in Alkham. Toby Howe, senior highways managers at Kent County Council, said: ""For those on the M20 there have been facilities - toilets have been provided - and we've had really good support from communities around the place to provide food. ""We're really appreciative of those who have brought food. ""There's been a lot of positives from this - people coming together to give support.""

"The EU and UK appear close to striking a post-Brexit trade deal, with Boris Johnson briefing his cabinet on the progress of talks in Brussels. Disputes over fishing rights and future business competition rules have been the major hurdles to agreement during months of often fraught talks. But BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said Downing Street now seemed ""very confident"" of a deal. Negotiators are now thought to be thrashing out the final details. The official announcement of a deal is expected on Thursday morning. The document is thought to be around 2,000 pages long, with both sides having until 31 December - when the UK leaves EU trading rules - get it approved by parliamentarians. Brexit: If the boat comes in How do voters feel about Brexit now? Brexit: Can the talks be extended? Why is fishing important in Brexit trade talks? A deal would end the prospect of the two sides imposing widespread import taxes - tariffs - on each other's goods from 1 January, which could have affected prices. EU sources said the UK prime minister and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen had been in contact in an attempt to break the deadlock before the expected pause in negotiations for Christmas. Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are happening:The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. What happens next with Brexit? The UK has insisted on having control over fishing in its waters from 1 January and retaining a larger share of the catch from them than under the current quota system. But the EU wanted to phase in a new fishing system over a longer period and retain more of its access to UK waters for boats from France, Spain and other member states. The sides also disagreed over whether UK firms should continue to follow the same rules as companies within the EU - and on how future trading disputes should be resolved. UK ministers have repeatedly ruled outany extension to the transition period, under which the UK has continued to follow Brussels's trade rules since it left the EU on 31 January. The European Research Group of Brexit-supporting Conservative MPs has promised to reconvene its ""star chamber"" of lawyers - which was highly critical of previous Prime Minister Theresa May's withdrawal agreement with the EU - to analyse any deal that is reached. Chairman Mark Francois and deputy chairman David Jones said it would ""scrutinise it in detail, to ensure that its provisions genuinely protect the sovereignty of the United Kingdom"".

"Hauliers will have to prove they have tested negative for coronavirus before travelling Thousands of drivers are facing another night in their lorries, despite France reopening its border with the UK. Lorries began boarding ferries at Dover on Wednesday after travel restrictions were lifted by the French government on the condition of a negative Covid test. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the government was using ""every tool we can"" to clear the backlog. Around 170 army personnel are helping to conduct tests, but police and weary drivers have clashed over long waits. At the temporary lorry park at Manston airfield, drivers complained of limited food supply and inadequate bathroom facilities. Mr Shapps warned of ""a lot of congestion and some, I'm afraid, anti-social behaviour around the ports that the police have been dealing with"". He said 6,000 lorries were in the area and the government had called in the Army to assist with getting the hauliers who had tested negative on their way - but added it was ""not something that could be done instantaneously"" and said people should stay away from Kent and the ports. This video can not be played Some drivers complained about unsanitary conditions and a lack of food France closed its border to arrivals from the UK late on Sunday amid concern over a highly-transmissible virus variant that was spreading in the UK. Latest measuresallow French citizens, British nationals living in France and hauliers to travel- if they test negative less than 72 hours before departure. All drivers, regardless of nationality, are required to take a rapid lateral flow test - with the results sent by text within 30 minutes. Drivers who test positive will be offered Covid-secure accommodation to self isolate, government minister Robert Jenrick said earlier. Testing will also take place on the French side for hauliers entering the UK. Some frustrated drivers staged a protest outside the port earlier in the day Mr Shapps said the NHS Test and Trace team were conducting ""roving tests of hauliers"". He added: ""They have to do that in many different languages because almost all the hauliers, I think well over 95%, are not UK hauliers. So they're having to deal with a lot of different things."" 'We are tired, we are disappointed, we are scared' Life on the road for truckers amid ports chaos New variant could be circulating outside UK Volunteers deliver meals to stranded truckers Eurotunnel said around around 700 cars, 50 vans and 20 trucks have been able to cross the Channel since this morning, and a ""flow"" of trucks has arrived at the British terminal since 16:00 GMT. Kent County Council leader Roger Gough said tensions between police and drivers had calmed down but added the situation remained ""quite fragile"". He told BBC Radio Kent that the ""most difficult"" challenge is clearing a route from Manston Airport to Dover, around 20 miles south, because of standing traffic. ""Whilst we're able, for instance, to get some progress in terms of people travelling via the Eurotunnel, it's much harder to get vehicles to the port in the current situation,"" he said. One lorry driver complained to the BBC: ""Police three days ago told us that testing will start soon, but they don't know when and that's why people are protesting. ""We just want to do the test and just go straight home."" One driver told the BBC he is tired and does not have much food. Rod McKenzie of the Road Haulage Association described the situation as ""chaos"", saying information given to lorry drivers had been ""extremely poor"". ""They're tired, frustrated, desperately wanting to get home for Christmas,"" he said. A government statement said they were ""working tirelessly to provide support to hauliers awaiting testing at Manston and the M20"" and free food and water was being provided. Typically around 10,000 lorries a day travel between Dover and Calais at Christmas, bringing in the fresh produce and the British Retail Consortium has warned the border closure may lead to some temporary food shortages. It comes as a further 39,237 people in the UK tested positive for virus - an all-time high - and there were 744 deaths within 28 days of a positive test,according to government figures.,external SOCIAL DISTANCING:Can I give my friends a hug?

"Residents of care homes have been given a higher priority than other older people Older people in Wales should be told when to expect a Covid vaccination, a commissioner representing them says. Helena Herklots says more clarity on the plan for over-80s in Wales would be ""helpful"" in light of different approaches elsewhere in the UK. Former MP Ann Clwyd said many feared they were missing out as jabs were being given out in parts of England. The Welsh Government says health boards are beginning to invite some people over the age of 80 for vaccination. The priority list puts vulnerable people into nine groups. Priority one is care home residents and staff, with priority two being people over 80 along with front-line health and care workers. Defending the Welsh Government's handling of the vaccine rollout, Health Minister Vaughan Gething said onsocial media,externalthe vaccine programme is ""not stuttering in Wales"" and was ahead of England per-head of population. Mr Gething said: ""I appreciate some people will be concerned but I can say categorically that people in Wales are not being left behind."" Helena Herklots said there was ""potential confusion"" because of reports of vaccination rollouts elsewhere Ms Herklots said older people wanted the vaccine as soon as possible and ""a great deal of work"" was going into to rolling out the vaccine ""quickly and effectively"". ""Given reports in the past few days about the different approaches being taking to deliver the vaccine in different parts of the UK, and the potential confusion this could cause, it would be helpful for the Welsh Government to provide further information to older people about its plans, clearly setting out what the arrangements will be and when they can expect to be vaccinated,"" the commissioner said. Ms Clwyd, 83, who was Labour MP for Cynon Valley for 35 years, has also called for clarity. ""People are very afraid and they want assurances. They want to know what is happening,"" she told BBC Wales. Ann Clwyd: ""They think everybody's getting the vaccine apart from them"" ""I know people around me who are more elderly than I am, and ill, and they've had no notification at all. ""They're hearing what's happening in England and they think everybody's getting the vaccine apart from them."" A Welsh Government spokesperson said: ""The safety and protection of the most vulnerable people is at the heart of our response to the pandemic. ""Health boards are starting to invite some people over 80 for vaccination now. We are hoping the second vaccine - the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine - will be approved by the UK regulator as this will help us accelerate our vaccination programme and provide more clinics in primary care settings, like GP practices."" Across Wales more than 25,000 people have received the first of two doses of the vaccine. Currently only one vaccine, BioNTech/Pfizer, has been approved for use in the UK. We can now see for the first time the breakdown of the numbers of people in Wales on the priority list for vaccines. They include more than 40,000 people living or working in care homes, thousands of front-line NHS and social care staff and the 174,000 people aged over 80. Included are 84,000 adults classed as ""extremely vulnerable"". More than 1.4 million people in all belong to one of the nine priority groups - including the overlap of about 192,000 people who may belong to more than one group. This leaves another one million or so people under 50, without a risk condition, who will be in line eventually to receive a vaccine. Welsh Conservative health spokesman Andrew RT Davies called on the Welsh Government to ""get a grip"". ""The vaccination programme is stuttering into life in Wales with some real concerns around lack of access for care homes and the over 80s compared to other parts of the UK,"" he said. ""To keep confidence Welsh Labour ministers need to get a grip. Otherwise, there is a risk, given the scale of the vaccination programme, the public will lose confidence in the Welsh Government's ability to deliver it, replicating their shambolic handling of the virus to date."" Plaid Cymru Member of the Senedd Dai Lloyd also criticised ""a dearth of information about vaccine rollout for the over-80s, which only adds to the anxiety people are facing over this Christmas"". Dr Lloyd, who is a GP, added: ""Reports suggest that other UK nations are well ahead of us in Wales, which is an unacceptable situation. ""To reflect Wales's older population, Plaid Cymru had called for vaccines to be allocated according to need, not simply allocated by population. The UK and Welsh Government must urgently reassess whether Wales is getting its fair share.""

"Joe Biden will have to build up his official Twitter followers from scratch Twitter has confirmed that the official US presidential accounts will be wiped of their millions of followers before being transferred to the Biden administration. Mr Biden's team ""fought"" the plan, but the social media giant said its decision was ""unequivocal"". The move marks a reversal from the last transition. Twitter agreed to Donald Trump's request in 2016 to inherit Barack Obama's millions of followers. Dutch prosecutors find Trump Twitter was hacked China says Twitter hacked after Trump retweet âIn 2016, the Trump administration absorbed all of President Obama's Twitter followers on @POTUS and @WhiteHouse - at Team 44's urging,â Rob Flaherty, the president-elect's digital director, tweeted on Monday. âIn 2020, Twitter has informed us that as of right now the Biden administration will have to start from zero.â It affects followers of government-led accounts such as @POTUS and @FLOTUS. Twitter said those who follow the current presidential accounts will be notified that they are being archived, and will be given the choice to follow the Biden administration's new accounts. Mr Bidenâs personal account, @JoeBiden, has 21.7 million followers, and will be unaffected by the move. President Trump has famously used his Twitter accounts, both professional and personal, to engage with voters. During his time in the White House, he has tweeted more than 50,000 times. However, according to Factbase, a website that tracks tweets and follower counts, Mr Trump has lost 369,849 followers on his personal account since November. In the same timeframe, President-elect Joe Biden has gained 2,671,790 followers. The decision from Twitter comes just days after chief executive Jack Dorsey unfollowed numerous political figures on the platform, including Mr Trump, Mr Biden and Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris. Marketing specialist Rebecca Lodge, from Start Up Disruptors, said of Twitter's decision: ""With millions of people following an account and Donald's 'fans' being quite fanatical, it could be a clever move by Twitter to ensure that any potential negative and hate-fuelled tweets are neutralised before the new president-elect takes up his position.""

"This video can not be played ""I am kicking myself very hard"" - Nicola Sturgeon apologises for mask rule breach Scotland's first minister has apologised for breaching Covid rules by taking her face mask off at a wake. TheScottish Sun has published a photograph,externalof Nicola Sturgeon standing talking to three people at a social distance, but with her face uncovered. She was attending a wake after the funeral of a Scottish government civil servant who died with Covid. Ms Sturgeon had been wearing a tartan mask and is said to have taken it off briefly as she was leaving the venue. The Scottish government's Covid regulations say that customers in hospitality venues must wear a face covering except when seated - including when they are entering, exiting and moving around. Anyone who breaches the face covering rules can be punished by a fixed penalty notice of Â£60. However Police Scotland said they would not be taking any action, saying the first minister had apologised and ""acknowledged this inadvertent breach"" of the regulations. What are the latest Covid rules in Scotland? Scottish level four rules 'may be strengthened' In a statement, Ms Sturgeon said she had ""briefly"" removed her face mask while attending a wake, calling it a ""stupid mistake"". Addressing MSPs at Holyrood, the first minister said she wanted to express ""how sorry I am for my breach of rules that I ask all of us to follow"". Ms Sturgeon said: ""I want to be clear that regardless of the circumstances, I was in the wrong. There are no excuses. ""These rules do apply to me, just as they do to everyone else, and the rules really matter. ""I am kicking myself very hard - possibly harder than my worst critic ever could - but more importantly I'll be making sure I don't drop my guard again."" Ms Sturgeon is understood to have been at the wake in the Stable Bar and Restaurant in Edinburgh after attending a service at nearby Mortonhall Crematorium. The first minister regularly uses her daily coronavirus briefings to remind people to cover their faces to limit the risk of spreading the virus. Scotland's national clinical director Jason Leitch toldGood Morning Scotlandhe had spoken to Ms Sturgeon last night and she was ""furious with herself"". ""She is absolutely mad at this little lapse in concentration - it's so easily done,"" he said. ""We live in a completely different world from a year ago. ""She was leaving a funeral of a colleague of ours - a wonderful, wonderful individual who did a huge amount of work during the pandemic. It was an awfully sad day for many of us in the government who knew him and his family well. ""It just reinforces again to all of us, the nature of these instructions and this virus."" When you make and promote coronavirus rules, it is not a good idea to break them. No-one understands that better than Nicola Sturgeon, who has already parted company with an MP and a medical adviser for past breaches. The first minister has not taken a train journey having tested positive for the virus as MP Margaret Ferrier did. She had not made unnecessary trips to a holiday home during lockdown as her former chief medical officer, Catherine Calderwood, did. Nor has she taken a drive to Barnard Castle as the prime minister's former adviser Dominic Cummings did. Nicola Sturgeon's breach - removing her face mask briefly to talk to people at a funeral wake - is relatively minor. But it is a breach. That's why the first minister has put her hands up and apologised for what she calls a ""stupid mistake"". It is a mistake that anyone could make but when you're fronting the campaign to get the public to obey coronavirus rules, it does not make that job any easier. A Scottish Conservative spokesman said: ""The first minister should know better. By forgetting the rules and failing to set a proper example, she's undermining essential public health messaging. ""It's a blunder that an ordinary member of the public wouldn't get away with. There cannot be one rule for Nicola Sturgeon and another for everyone else."" Scotland's Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf said in a tweet that Ms Sturgeon had been ""upfront"" from the very beginning of the pandemic. ""She has apologised for [the] accidental lapse (which I suspect most of us have had one over last 9 months),""he wrote,external. He said the FM was her own harshest critic and that ""most people"" would accept her apology and move on. Jillian Evans, head of health intelligence at NHS Grampian, said high-profile breaches of Covid rules ""matter a lot"" to the public. She told the BBC'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme: ""There are clear breaches and then there are indiscretions. ""I'm not passing comment on anyone in particular, but some of us are prone to lapses now and again. ""The main thing is how honest and trustworthy our leaders are. I don't doubt anyone in Scotland's dedication to the cause but it really does matter, because everybody must follow the rules at all times as much as they possibly can.""

"McLaughlan completed the 25-mile journey on 11 December A man who rode from Scotland to the Isle of Man by jet ski to see his girlfriend has left the island by ferry upon his release from jail. Dale McLaughlan made the four-and-a-half hour crossing from the Isle of Whithorn to Ramsey on 11 December. He then walked another 15 miles (25km) to his girlfriend's home in Douglas. The 28-year-old - who served part of afour-week sentencefor the Covid-19 border control breach - told the BBC he was ""happy to be going home"". Under current Isle of Man coronavirus laws McLaughlan, from Irvine in North Ayrshire, was required to leave the island after his release or face further prosecution. Speaking toIsle of Man Newspapers,external, his girlfriend Jessica Radcliffe said: ""I don't understand why he's been told to leave when he's isolated for two weeks before he came over with a negative test. ""He had a negative test in jail, he didn't put any of the public at risk, and he's done isolation in jail. ""That's four weeks already, so why does he need to leave the island? To punish him this much, they shouldn't be doing that."" McLaughlan was arrested two days after his arrival, having spent time mixing with people in two busy nightclubs, his court case heard. Douglas Courthouse heard it was the first time he had used a jet ski. Only non-residents given special permission are currently allowed to enter the island. McLaughlan's defence advocate said he suffered from depression and was not coping with being unable to see his partner.

"This video can not be played Some drivers complained about unsanitary conditions and a lack of food Lorry drivers who have tested negative for coronavirus have begun boarding ferries at the port of Dover after France reopened its border with the UK. Some 3,800 lorries have been parked up in Kent after France closed its UK border on Sunday amid concern over a fast-spreading variant of the virus. France ended its ban on UK arrivals on Wednesday, on the condition that people were tested before travelling. Earlier, police clashed with drivers who have spent days in their cabs. Transport Secretary Grant Shappswarned there were ""severe delays"",externaland urged people to avoid travelling to Kent. Around 50 countries imposed a ban after the UK warned of anew, fast-spreading variant of coronavirus. 'We are tired, we are disappointed, we are scared' Life on the road for truckers amid ports chaos New variant could be circulating outside UK The French government's ban, introduced on Sunday, has now been eased toallow French citizens, British nationals living in France and hauliers to travel- if they test negative less than 72 hours before departure. Soldiers have joined NHS Test and Trace staff in Kent to carry out rapid tests on thousands of stranded lorry drivers. But Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said it could take ""a few days"" to clear the backlog. Lorry drivers will have to prove they have tested negative for coronavirus before travelling A number of drivers clashed with police this morning, with officers trying to push back a small crowd trying to enter the Port of Dover. Kent Police said one man is in custody after being arrested for obstructing a highway in Dover and there have been disturbances at Manston Airport, where a lorry-holding facility run by the Department for Transport is now full. The entrance to the Port of Dover is currently closed with a line of police officers blocking it, BBC reporter Amanda Akass said. They told her they will not start allowing vehicles through until ""protesters"" - several dozen drivers - move from the roundabout at the entrance. But the drivers have said they will not move as they do not want to go to the back of the queue and cannot move as the road is blocked in both directions. One driver told the BBC he is tired and does not have much food. ""We are very tired. We're staying in cars, we don't have a lot of food, no money,"" one driver told the BBC. ""Police three days ago told us that testing will start soon, but they don't know when and that's why people are protesting,"" another said. ""We just want to do the test and just go straight home."" Rod McKenzie of the Road Haulage Association described the situation as ""chaos"" as lorry drivers headed to ports thinking the borders would be open. ""They're tired, frustrated, desperately wanting to get home for Christmas,"" he said. He said the information given to them has been ""extremely poor"", while food provision, toilets and washing facilities were ""inadequate"". Richard Lloyd, director of a British firm that imports farm machinery from Poland, said he had been called by the family of a driver who was stuck without food, asking whether he could get a loaf of bread to the lorry. ""He didn't want to go anywhere because of the security of the truck, and obviously a place in the queue, so it was a desperate situation,"" Mr Lloyd said. The government says free food and water is being provided. A statement said there are 12 food trucks at Manston Airport and eight more arriving, and more than 200 toilets. It also said there are toilets stationed every kilometre between parts of the M20. ""We are working tirelessly to provide support to hauliers awaiting testing at Manston and the M20,"" it said. By Simon Jones, BBC reporter at the scene Frustrated lorry drivers have confronted the police as tensions over their continuing confinement threatened to boil over. Some hauliers marched out of the Manston lorry park, where they've been forced to sleep in their cabs, demanding to know when they'll be allowed to go home. There's a huge backlog of traffic to clear. Some hauliers said they'd been told the testing on the site was initially delayed because the tests got held up in traffic. Manston is now full - so there'll be some pressure on the authorities to get as many tests done as quickly as possible to clear space for any new arrivals. This video can not be played Aerial views of the thousands of lorries stuck in Kent since the border shut Eurotunnel said around around 700 cars, 50 vans and 20 trucks s have been able to cross the Channel since this morning, and a ""flow"" of trucks has arrived at the British terminal since 16:00 GMT. Roger Gough, leader of Kent County Council, told BBC Radio Kent that the ""most difficult"" challenge is clearing a route from Manston Airport to Dover, around 20 miles south, ""to be able to get those lorries onto the ferries"". ""Whilst we're able, for instance, to get some progress in terms of people travelling via the Eurotunnel, it's much harder to get vehicles to the port in the current situation,"" he said. ""The problem is also that - particularly for the non-HGV traffic, the families and so on - you have some really quite worrying welfare situations,"" he said. He added that the British authorities are in a ""race against time"" because the last ferry leaves on Christmas eve, and are trying to persuade the French to ""keep things running on the Calais side over Christmas day"". More than 5,000 lorries are being held in Kent, according to the Department for Transport. Officials have been going from lorry to lorry to provide tests. Home Secretary Priti Patel urged hauliers ""not to travel to Kent as we work to alleviate congestion"" as ""travelling now will slow things down"". ""Tourist travellers who are not French residents should not travel,"" she tweeted. The Port of Dover alsourged passengers not to turn up,externalwithout a negative coronavirus test. NHS Test and Trace staff have been going from vehicle to vehicle with tests at Dover. Mr Jenrick told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it is likely to take ""a few days"" to clear the backlog of lorries that have built up. He said there would be ""multiple testing sites"" at Manston Airport and elsewhere. Rapid ""lateral flow"" tests will be used, which can detect the new variant and work like a pregnancy test to give a result in about 30 minutes. Freight drivers will receive their test result by text, and a negative result gives them the right to cross the Channel. If they test positive they will be offered Covid-secure hotel accommodation nearby where they will have to self isolate. Testing will also take place on the French side for hauliers entering the UK.

"Rapid tests for coronavirus are a ""useful"" public health tool despite only picking up half as much virus as tests done in a lab, a group of scientists has said. The 30-minute test has been criticised for how it measures up to the tests processed in the government's mega-labs. But the scientists cautioned against comparing them directly. The tests serve different purposes in different contexts, they explained. And rapid tests may be a better guide to who is currently infectious. During a testing pilot in Liverpool, the devices picked up two-thirds of the most infectious cases - all people who would not have otherwise been tested at all. The pilot, which made tests available to anyone in the city who wanted one, picked up 1,300 infections in people without symptoms in a population of about half a million. Prof Louise Kenny at the University of Liverpool said even if one in three infections was missed, that left two infections which would not otherwise have been found. No test was perfect, she said, but she warned against ""making perfection the enemy of the good"". However, the evaluation of the Liverpool pilot found there was ""no clear evidence that the introduction of 'mass' testing in Liverpool impacted on Covid-19 cases or hospital admissions."" The scientists on the panel included those involved in evaluating rapid tests in Liverpool, Oxford and the Porton Down research facility. Standard lab tests, also known as PCR tests, pick up some infections that rapid or ""lateral flow"" tests miss, particularly in the early stages of infection. These are the tests you'll have if you have symptoms. PCR tests are very important for use in diagnosing people - by the time someone turns up at a hospital they may not have much virus in their nose or throat, as it migrates to the lungs. So in these situations having a very sensitive test is useful. They are crucial for use in surveillance of the virus, and they're also important for contact-tracing since, even if that individual is no longer infectious, they may have passed it on to others who are. But the downside is they pick up small fragments of inactive virus, meaning some people might be told to isolate when they are no longer capable of infecting anyone. Rapid or lateral flow tests, on the other hand, are not good at picking up relatively small amounts of virus. Overall, the Liverpool study found the devices only picked up 40% of cases - less than expected. This means the tests will miss people in the day or two before they are about to become infectious, as well as those who have cleared the infection from their systems. But they do find the majority of the most infectious cases - and lateral flow tests have the major advantage of not needing to be taken to a lab. They work by dipping a nose and throat swab in special solution and then dropping that fluid onto a plastic stick a bit like a pregnancy test. ""The time and scale gained by having a low-cost test that returns results within an hour without a laboratory is a valuable new tool for tackling Covid-19,"" according to Prof Iain Buchan, who led the Liverpool evaluation. This allows for many more people to access testing, including those without symptoms - people for whom it is ""this or nothing"", Prof Kenny said. Screening asymptomatic people in the community is potentially nothing but positive, provided people don't change their behaviour after a negative result - and isolate after a positive one. It's a more difficult question once you are using them to clear people to do something - for examplevisit a care home residentorcross the border into France. Missing perhaps a third of infections - although it can be less if the test is done by a trained person - might be too high a risk in those cases. But even if you are allowing someone to do something they wouldn't have otherwise, the tests can allow people to balance risk with harm. They might provide reassurance to allow someone in a care home who has been deprived of social contact to have a visitor wearing PPE. Or, if there is one Covid case in a school year, it could be used to prevent a whole class from having to isolate and miss face-to-face education. They don't eliminate risk, but they can reduce it in situations where there is enough benefit. And their accuracy can be improved by screening people regularly, Prof Kenny explained - perhaps once or twice a week in schools, universities and specific workplaces. Prof Jacqui Ramagge, who led student testing efforts at the University of Durham, said ""the chances of someone being positive when they are repeatedly testing negative is very, very low"".

Canada's health agency authorised the Moderna vaccine on Wednesday, saying in a release that ""after a thorough, independent review of the evidence, it has determined that the Moderna vaccine meets the departmentâs stringent safety, efficacy and quality requirements"". Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said Canada will have 168,000 doses by the end of the month. In the US, where the Covid case count has topped 18 million, the federal government has agreed to a $1.95bn deal with Pfizer for 100m doses. At least 70m will be delivered by 30 June. The US Centers for Disease Control reports that 4.6m doses have been delivered as of Monday, and more than 614,117 have been administered. BBC News Analysis Several counties in southern
England will
be put under tier four restrictions from Boxing Day. Other areas were also moved into a
higher tier as the government tries to contain the spread of the new variant of
Covid-19. All parts of England have been
placed in a tier depending on factors such as the speed at which the virus is
spreading or the strain on hospitals â four being the highest. Restrictions in these areas
include:  The whole of Wales has entered
another lockdown. Mainland Scotland and Northern Ireland start new lockdowns on
Boxing Day. Read more here. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Anyone singing In the Bleak
Midwinter may want to write another verse. Cases, numbers in hospital and
deaths are all going up. Itâs likely the NHS will soon be
dealing with more Covid patients than at the peak in April. The new variants are causing
concern â especially as the one detected first in the UK continued to spread
even during the November lockdown. Vaccines will be the solution, but
they take time to roll out and until then it is going to be rough. The only other tool we have to
stop the virus spreading is reducing our contacts with other people. Thatâs why millions more of us are
moving up the tiers on Boxing Day. The hope is that the night is darkest
before the dawn and that come Spring, the virusâs grip on our lives will start
to ease.  As we mentioned earlier, ministers in
Ireland are self-isolating and awaiting test results after a minister tested
positive. Charlie McConalogue displayed no
symptoms but is self-isolating, his spokesman told the Irish Times. He received his test result several hours
after attending a cabinet meeting. The agriculture minister had been in
Brussels on government business over the last few days and was tested on his
return, according to broadcaster RTÃ. Read more here The first trucks have started leaving a temporary lorry park in Kent after France reopened its border with the UK. It follows clashes with between frustrated hauliers and police, as drivers have become increasingly impatient to get home for Christmas. France has lifted its ban on some UK arrivals, but only if they can show proof of a negative Covid test taken less than 72 hours before departure. ""We are very tired. We're staying in cars, we don't have a lot of food, no money,"" one lorry driver told the BBC. ""We just want to do the test and just go straight home,"" said another. A huge backlog of traffic remains. It all adds to the pressure on the authorities to get as many tests done as quickly as possible. Read more.  Members of New York Cityâs Sheriffâs office
will conduct home visits to ensure people from the UK are quarantining, Mayor
Bill de Blasio said. International visitors to the city
will be handed an order to quarantine and could face a $1,000 (Â£740) a day fine if
found not complying with the rules. âWe cannot take chances with anyone
who travels, particularly folks traveling in from the U.K.,â de Blasio said. New York was the epicentre of the
outbreak in the US earlier this year. The US state of New York has recorded
36,724 deaths since the outbreak began. Volunteers from KhalsaAid provided more than 800 meals to stranded drivers Teams of volunteers have delivered hundreds of meals to lorry drivers stranded in Kent. Members of Maidenhead's KhalsaAid travelled 80 miles (130km) to take food to drivers hit by delays at the border. On Tuesday, some of the Sikh charity's LangarAid members travelled almost double the distance, from Coventry, to bring water and food. KhalsaAid founder Ravi Singh said: ""It's horrible for [the drivers], there's nothing here - no food, no shops - it's like a prison for them. ""We can't sit back and do nothing."" Read more. This video can not be played Covid: Variant from SA 'yet more transmissible' The health secretary has described the new variant of coronavirus which came to light in South Africa as "" highly concerning"". Matt Hancock said the variant was ""more transmissible and appears to have mutated further than the new variant that has been discovered in the UK"". In consequence, he said the government was quarantining the two cases found in the UK, as well as their close contacts. The UK government is also placing ""immediate restrictions"" on travel from South Africa. Mr Hancock said anyone who had been in South Africa in the past fortnight, or who had had contact with someone who had been in South Africa in the last two weeks, ""must quarantine immediately"".  Hundreds of immigrants in France
working on the coronavirus front line have been recognised with fast-track
citizenship. The interior ministry invited
residents helping with efforts against Covid-19 to apply for accelerated
naturalisation. More than 700 people, including healthcare
professionals, cleaners and shop workers, have already been granted citizenship
or are in the final stages of receiving it. Read more here Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News Just as weâve got used to the idea of one worrying variant of this coronavirus, another one comes along. The newest one, which has been brought from South Africa in recent weeks and infected two people in the UK, is âhighly concerningâ, says Health Secretary Matt Hancock. It comes hot on the heels of the discovery of another variant in Kent causing sharply rising cases in the south and east of England, which will mean strict tier four restrictions being introduced in more areas of England on Boxing Day. These are two different variants, but they have some similarities and share a mutation. Crucially they are both concerning, leading to large increases in cases in South African and the UK. UK scientists are skilled at genomic sequencing - the technique used to track mutations of the virus. Thatâs the main reason these variants have been found quickly and acted upon, but just because other countries havenât detected them yet doesnât mean they arenât present. The faster they can be found, the more quickly they can be squashed. With hospital admissions rising to near levels of the spring peak and deaths increasing daily, ministers have no choice but to act quickly. Cutting social contact between people, tighter rules on travel and rapid testing â which is being rolled out to workers in care homes and is planned in schools and many local authorities â are the tools they are using to fight the virus on all fronts. In the last two weeks, California has seen half a million new coronavirus cases. On Tuesday, America's most populous state hit two million Covid-19 cases and more than 23,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University data. Officials now predict hospital admissions could reach 100,000 in January if the spread continues. The spike has left the state's health system overwhelmed. A number of intensive care facilities have been operating at over-maximum capacity, with less than 2% bed availability statewide. In Southern California, there is 0% ICU availability, local media report. The state is also seeing a shortage of medical staff - and is now turning outside the US, to places like Australia and Taiwan, to seek temporary medical workers, the AP reports. Health experts have continued to urge residents to practice social distancing during the rest of the holiday season, emphasising that hospitals may not be able to handle any further strain. The number of daily positive cases in the UK has hit another record high, with39,237,externalpositive cases reported in the past 24 hours. However, cases were thought to be higher in the UK during the spring peak when testing was much more limited. Government data shows a further 744 people have died within 28 days of a positive test. The total death toll now stands at 69,051. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Matt Hancock's message of hope at end of Christmas briefing Health Secretary Matt Hancock has urged the British public ""not to give up now"". ""We know what we can control this virus; we know that we can get through this together,"" he said, after announcing new tier restrictions to be imposed on large swathes of England from Boxing Day. ""I believe that everybody will do what is needed to keep themselves and others safe, especially this Christmas,"" he said. ""And I know, from the bottom of my heart, that there are brighter skies ahead."" Today's Downing Street briefing has now come to an end. Health Secretary Matt Hancock acknowledged that 2020 had been ""a hard year"" and despite all our efforts, the new variant of Covid-19 made further action ""difficult but necessary"". Here's what we learned at the press conference: The last question comes from Arj Singh from HuffPost. He asks if, given the highly-transmissible new variant, the government is guilty of overpromising by suggesting the UK can return to normality by Easter. Hancock replies that he is ""highly confident we will get things back to normal before 2022"" adding that the speed of the vaccine roll-out is accelerating. And that is the final question. Hancock wishes everyone a happy Christmas before leaving the lectern. Sam Lister from the Daily Express asks how many people will be vaccinated by Easter. Mr Hancock says he would love ""to have a stab at the answer"" but it depends hugely on the speed of production on the array of different vaccines that the UK has purchased. He says he does not want to put pressure on regulators in terms of approving the Astra-Zeneca Oxford vaccine, knowing that they will undertake their work as thoroughly as possible. He says the roll-out of the vaccine will be a ""big task"" for the NHS. ""The true answer will be as fast as we possibly can."" Dr Harries said we shouldn't jump to conclusions on transmission in schools Jane Merrick of the i asks why the whole country isn't going into lockdown. She also asks if, given evidence of increased infections among the under-15s, there is a case for mass testing in primary schools and a staggered return for primary schools as well as secondaries. Hancock says the new variant is highly concentrated and the new tier rules are aimed at keeping the variant in the South East. Dr Hopkins says ""we have no evidence this virus is more transmissible in children yet"". ""We will constantly take decisions with the experts in education over what is best for the children, along with controlling the virus,"" she adds. Dr Harries says: ""We shouldn't jump to the conclusion that just because every child is in school that it is a significant place for transmission."" Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent Will all of England end up in tier four? The health secretary says he wants action to be ""proportionate"" and that the
current tiers system is working. So that suggests more of ahopefully not,rather thannever. Wales has brought forward a lockdown. Northern Ireland will
enter one on Boxing Day. At the same time, mainland Scotland will go into the
tightest level of restrictions. Ministers in England are still trying to keep a
more local approach but, on future national measures, theyâre certainly not
ruling anything out. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.999997
"This video can not be played Some drivers complained about unsanitary conditions and a lack of food Lorry drivers who have tested negative for coronavirus have begun boarding ferries at the port of Dover after France reopened its border with the UK. Some 3,800 lorries have been parked up in Kent after France closed its UK border on Sunday amid concern over a fast-spreading variant of the virus. France ended its ban on UK arrivals on Wednesday, on the condition that people were tested before travelling. Earlier, police clashed with drivers who have spent days in their cabs. Transport Secretary Grant Shappswarned there were ""severe delays"",externaland urged people to avoid travelling to Kent. Around 50 countries imposed a ban after the UK warned of anew, fast-spreading variant of coronavirus. 'We are tired, we are disappointed, we are scared' Life on the road for truckers amid ports chaos New variant could be circulating outside UK The French government's ban, introduced on Sunday, has now been eased toallow French citizens, British nationals living in France and hauliers to travel- if they test negative less than 72 hours before departure. Soldiers have joined NHS Test and Trace staff in Kent to carry out rapid tests on thousands of stranded lorry drivers. But Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said it could take ""a few days"" to clear the backlog. Lorry drivers will have to prove they have tested negative for coronavirus before travelling A number of drivers clashed with police this morning, with officers trying to push back a small crowd trying to enter the Port of Dover. Kent Police said one man is in custody after being arrested for obstructing a highway in Dover and there have been disturbances at Manston Airport, where a lorry-holding facility run by the Department for Transport is now full. The entrance to the Port of Dover is currently closed with a line of police officers blocking it, BBC reporter Amanda Akass said. They told her they will not start allowing vehicles through until ""protesters"" - several dozen drivers - move from the roundabout at the entrance. But the drivers have said they will not move as they do not want to go to the back of the queue and cannot move as the road is blocked in both directions. One driver told the BBC he is tired and does not have much food. ""We are very tired. We're staying in cars, we don't have a lot of food, no money,"" one driver told the BBC. ""Police three days ago told us that testing will start soon, but they don't know when and that's why people are protesting,"" another said. ""We just want to do the test and just go straight home."" Rod McKenzie of the Road Haulage Association described the situation as ""chaos"" as lorry drivers headed to ports thinking the borders would be open. ""They're tired, frustrated, desperately wanting to get home for Christmas,"" he said. He said the information given to them has been ""extremely poor"", while food provision, toilets and washing facilities were ""inadequate"". Richard Lloyd, director of a British firm that imports farm machinery from Poland, said he had been called by the family of a driver who was stuck without food, asking whether he could get a loaf of bread to the lorry. ""He didn't want to go anywhere because of the security of the truck, and obviously a place in the queue, so it was a desperate situation,"" Mr Lloyd said. The government says free food and water is being provided. A statement said there are 12 food trucks at Manston Airport and eight more arriving, and more than 200 toilets. It also said there are toilets stationed every kilometre between parts of the M20. ""We are working tirelessly to provide support to hauliers awaiting testing at Manston and the M20,"" it said. By Simon Jones, BBC reporter at the scene Frustrated lorry drivers have confronted the police as tensions over their continuing confinement threatened to boil over. Some hauliers marched out of the Manston lorry park, where they've been forced to sleep in their cabs, demanding to know when they'll be allowed to go home. There's a huge backlog of traffic to clear. Some hauliers said they'd been told the testing on the site was initially delayed because the tests got held up in traffic. Manston is now full - so there'll be some pressure on the authorities to get as many tests done as quickly as possible to clear space for any new arrivals. This video can not be played Aerial views of the thousands of lorries stuck in Kent since the border shut Eurotunnel said around around 700 cars, 50 vans and 20 trucks s have been able to cross the Channel since this morning, and a ""flow"" of trucks has arrived at the British terminal since 16:00 GMT. Roger Gough, leader of Kent County Council, told BBC Radio Kent that the ""most difficult"" challenge is clearing a route from Manston Airport to Dover, around 20 miles south, ""to be able to get those lorries onto the ferries"". ""Whilst we're able, for instance, to get some progress in terms of people travelling via the Eurotunnel, it's much harder to get vehicles to the port in the current situation,"" he said. ""The problem is also that - particularly for the non-HGV traffic, the families and so on - you have some really quite worrying welfare situations,"" he said. He added that the British authorities are in a ""race against time"" because the last ferry leaves on Christmas eve, and are trying to persuade the French to ""keep things running on the Calais side over Christmas day"". More than 5,000 lorries are being held in Kent, according to the Department for Transport. Officials have been going from lorry to lorry to provide tests. Home Secretary Priti Patel urged hauliers ""not to travel to Kent as we work to alleviate congestion"" as ""travelling now will slow things down"". ""Tourist travellers who are not French residents should not travel,"" she tweeted. The Port of Dover alsourged passengers not to turn up,externalwithout a negative coronavirus test. NHS Test and Trace staff have been going from vehicle to vehicle with tests at Dover. Mr Jenrick told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it is likely to take ""a few days"" to clear the backlog of lorries that have built up. He said there would be ""multiple testing sites"" at Manston Airport and elsewhere. Rapid ""lateral flow"" tests will be used, which can detect the new variant and work like a pregnancy test to give a result in about 30 minutes. Freight drivers will receive their test result by text, and a negative result gives them the right to cross the Channel. If they test positive they will be offered Covid-secure hotel accommodation nearby where they will have to self isolate. Testing will also take place on the French side for hauliers entering the UK.

The Road Haulage Association said: ""Even if the border is opened up, a short delay in the process is going to mean huge delays in the supply chain."" Normally, about 10,000 lorries a day travel between Dover and Calais at Christmas, largely bringing in the freshest produce. More than 50 other countries, including Germany, Italy, India and Pakistan, are continuing to block travellers from the UK. The Netherlands and Belgium have also now lifted their ban, but will only accept people if they have a recent negative result. The Netherlands has demanded UK arrivals use so-called PCR tests, which can take over 24 hours to turn around as they require a lab.

"This video can not be played ""I am kicking myself very hard"" - Nicola Sturgeon apologises for mask rule breach Scotland's first minister has apologised for breaching Covid rules by taking her face mask off at a wake. TheScottish Sun has published a photograph,externalof Nicola Sturgeon standing talking to three people at a social distance, but with her face uncovered. She was attending a wake after the funeral of a Scottish government civil servant who died with Covid. Ms Sturgeon had been wearing a tartan mask and is said to have taken it off briefly as she was leaving the venue. The Scottish government's Covid regulations say that customers in hospitality venues must wear a face covering except when seated - including when they are entering, exiting and moving around. Anyone who breaches the face covering rules can be punished by a fixed penalty notice of Â£60. However Police Scotland said they would not be taking any action, saying the first minister had apologised and ""acknowledged this inadvertent breach"" of the regulations. What are the latest Covid rules in Scotland? Scottish level four rules 'may be strengthened' In a statement, Ms Sturgeon said she had ""briefly"" removed her face mask while attending a wake, calling it a ""stupid mistake"". Addressing MSPs at Holyrood, the first minister said she wanted to express ""how sorry I am for my breach of rules that I ask all of us to follow"". Ms Sturgeon said: ""I want to be clear that regardless of the circumstances, I was in the wrong. There are no excuses. ""These rules do apply to me, just as they do to everyone else, and the rules really matter. ""I am kicking myself very hard - possibly harder than my worst critic ever could - but more importantly I'll be making sure I don't drop my guard again."" Ms Sturgeon is understood to have been at the wake in the Stable Bar and Restaurant in Edinburgh after attending a service at nearby Mortonhall Crematorium. The first minister regularly uses her daily coronavirus briefings to remind people to cover their faces to limit the risk of spreading the virus. Scotland's national clinical director Jason Leitch toldGood Morning Scotlandhe had spoken to Ms Sturgeon last night and she was ""furious with herself"". ""She is absolutely mad at this little lapse in concentration - it's so easily done,"" he said. ""We live in a completely different world from a year ago. ""She was leaving a funeral of a colleague of ours - a wonderful, wonderful individual who did a huge amount of work during the pandemic. It was an awfully sad day for many of us in the government who knew him and his family well. ""It just reinforces again to all of us, the nature of these instructions and this virus."" When you make and promote coronavirus rules, it is not a good idea to break them. No-one understands that better than Nicola Sturgeon, who has already parted company with an MP and a medical adviser for past breaches. The first minister has not taken a train journey having tested positive for the virus as MP Margaret Ferrier did. She had not made unnecessary trips to a holiday home during lockdown as her former chief medical officer, Catherine Calderwood, did. Nor has she taken a drive to Barnard Castle as the prime minister's former adviser Dominic Cummings did. Nicola Sturgeon's breach - removing her face mask briefly to talk to people at a funeral wake - is relatively minor. But it is a breach. That's why the first minister has put her hands up and apologised for what she calls a ""stupid mistake"". It is a mistake that anyone could make but when you're fronting the campaign to get the public to obey coronavirus rules, it does not make that job any easier. A Scottish Conservative spokesman said: ""The first minister should know better. By forgetting the rules and failing to set a proper example, she's undermining essential public health messaging. ""It's a blunder that an ordinary member of the public wouldn't get away with. There cannot be one rule for Nicola Sturgeon and another for everyone else."" Scotland's Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf said in a tweet that Ms Sturgeon had been ""upfront"" from the very beginning of the pandemic. ""She has apologised for [the] accidental lapse (which I suspect most of us have had one over last 9 months),""he wrote,external. He said the FM was her own harshest critic and that ""most people"" would accept her apology and move on. Jillian Evans, head of health intelligence at NHS Grampian, said high-profile breaches of Covid rules ""matter a lot"" to the public. She told the BBC'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme: ""There are clear breaches and then there are indiscretions. ""I'm not passing comment on anyone in particular, but some of us are prone to lapses now and again. ""The main thing is how honest and trustworthy our leaders are. I don't doubt anyone in Scotland's dedication to the cause but it really does matter, because everybody must follow the rules at all times as much as they possibly can.""

"The UK has detected two cases of another new variant of coronavirus, the health secretary Matt Hancock says. The cases in London and north west England are contacts of people who travelled to South Africa, where the variant was discovered. Travel restrictions with South Africa have been imposed. Anyone who has travelled there in the past fortnight, and anyone they have been in contact with, are being told to quarantine immediately. The variant has been causing mounting concern in South Africa, where health minister Zweli Mkhize warned that ""young, previously healthy people are now becoming very sick"". He said the country ""cannot go through what we went through in the early days of the Aids pandemic"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Scientists in South Africa say,externalthe variant has ""spread rapidly"" and became the dominant form of the virus in parts of the country. The variant is still being analysed, but the data are consistent with it spreading more quickly. It was detected for the first time in the UK on Tuesday. This variant shares some similarities to the one that hasalready been detected in the UK, although they have evolved separately. Both have a mutation - called N501Y - which is in a crucial part of the virus that it uses to infect the body's cells. Prof Neil Ferguson, from Imperial College London, said: ""I think the greatest concern of ours at the moment is the South African one. ""There's certainly anecdotal reports of explosive outbreaks for that virus and very steep increases in case numbers."" At the Downing Street press briefing, Mr Hancock said the new variant was ""highly concerning"" and that anyone told to quarantine must avoid ""all contact with any other person whatsoever"". At the same briefing, he announced millions more people were beingmoved to Tier 4 on Boxing Dayin an effort to control the virus. New coronavirus variant: What do we know? Covid variant find âdue to work of UK scientistsâ What's happening to the numbers in Africa? Dr Susan Hopkins, from Public Health England (PHE), said ""both look like they are more transmissible"" but said they were ""still learning"" about the variant imported from South Africa. She said she was ""pretty confident"" the quarantine and travel rules would control the spread of the new variant. Prof Lawrence Young, from Warwick Medical School, said: ""The standard measures to restrict transmission (hands, face, space) will prevent infection with this variant. ""The move to harsher levels of restriction across the country is inevitable. "" FollowJameson Twitter,external By Farouk Chothia, BBC News The government tightened restrictions for the festive season, including closing beaches along the famous Garden Route in Western Cape province. It faced resistance from the main opposition party, the Democratic Alliance (DA), and some lobby groups, who challenged the decision in the courts, arguing that the closure of beaches would have a devastating effect on small businesses.

"A child under the age of one has died with Covid-19 in Scotland, official figures show. The death of the baby girl is the youngest Covid death in Scotland and the only one under the age of 15. National Records of Scotland (NRS) counts all death certificates that mention Covid-19, even if the person has not been tested for the virus. The baby's death was registered between 14 and 20 December along with 202 others that week. Scotland passes 6,000 deaths from Covid-19 In total, 6,298 death certificates in Scotland have mentioned Covid-19 since the outbreak began in March. About 75% of all these deaths are of people aged 75 or over, with 15% in the 65-74 age group. The latest NRS figures,externalalso show that the total number of ""excess deaths"" in 2020 is now the highest for at least 40 years. Excess deaths are counted above an average from the last five years. There have been 62,415 deaths from all causes so far this year, compared with a five-year average of 57,760 - an excess of 4,655. There were 58,108 deaths in Scotland last year, with 1,122 excess deaths. Since the first Covid-19 deaths were registered in Scotland on 17 March there have been 6,399 excess deaths, but the number of deaths in the first weeks of 2020 was below average which makes the overall figure lower.

Canada's health agency authorised the Moderna vaccine on Wednesday, saying in a release that ""after a thorough, independent review of the evidence, it has determined that the Moderna vaccine meets the departmentâs stringent safety, efficacy and quality requirements"". Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said Canada will have 168,000 doses by the end of the month. In the US, where the Covid case count has topped 18 million, the federal government has agreed to a $1.95bn deal with Pfizer for 100m doses. At least 70m will be delivered by 30 June. The US Centers for Disease Control reports that 4.6m doses have been delivered as of Monday, and more than 614,117 have been administered. BBC News Analysis Several counties in southern
England will
be put under tier four restrictions from Boxing Day. Other areas were also moved into a
higher tier as the government tries to contain the spread of the new variant of
Covid-19. All parts of England have been
placed in a tier depending on factors such as the speed at which the virus is
spreading or the strain on hospitals â four being the highest. Restrictions in these areas
include:  The whole of Wales has entered
another lockdown. Mainland Scotland and Northern Ireland start new lockdowns on
Boxing Day. Read more here. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Anyone singing In the Bleak
Midwinter may want to write another verse. Cases, numbers in hospital and
deaths are all going up. Itâs likely the NHS will soon be
dealing with more Covid patients than at the peak in April. The new variants are causing
concern â especially as the one detected first in the UK continued to spread
even during the November lockdown. Vaccines will be the solution, but
they take time to roll out and until then it is going to be rough. The only other tool we have to
stop the virus spreading is reducing our contacts with other people. Thatâs why millions more of us are
moving up the tiers on Boxing Day. The hope is that the night is darkest
before the dawn and that come Spring, the virusâs grip on our lives will start
to ease.  As we mentioned earlier, ministers in
Ireland are self-isolating and awaiting test results after a minister tested
positive. Charlie McConalogue displayed no
symptoms but is self-isolating, his spokesman told the Irish Times. He received his test result several hours
after attending a cabinet meeting. The agriculture minister had been in
Brussels on government business over the last few days and was tested on his
return, according to broadcaster RTÃ. Read more here The first trucks have started leaving a temporary lorry park in Kent after France reopened its border with the UK.

This video can not be played Covid: Variant from SA 'yet more transmissible' The health secretary has described the new variant of coronavirus which came to light in South Africa as "" highly concerning"". Matt Hancock said the variant was ""more transmissible and appears to have mutated further than the new variant that has been discovered in the UK"". In consequence, he said the government was quarantining the two cases found in the UK, as well as their close contacts. The UK government is also placing ""immediate restrictions"" on travel from South Africa. Mr Hancock said anyone who had been in South Africa in the past fortnight, or who had had contact with someone who had been in South Africa in the last two weeks, ""must quarantine immediately"".  Hundreds of immigrants in France
working on the coronavirus front line have been recognised with fast-track
citizenship. The interior ministry invited
residents helping with efforts against Covid-19 to apply for accelerated
naturalisation. More than 700 people, including healthcare
professionals, cleaners and shop workers, have already been granted citizenship
or are in the final stages of receiving it. Read more here Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News Just as weâve got used to the idea of one worrying variant of this coronavirus, another one comes along. The newest one, which has been brought from South Africa in recent weeks and infected two people in the UK, is âhighly concerningâ, says Health Secretary Matt Hancock. It comes hot on the heels of the discovery of another variant in Kent causing sharply rising cases in the south and east of England, which will mean strict tier four restrictions being introduced in more areas of England on Boxing Day. These are two different variants, but they have some similarities and share a mutation. Crucially they are both concerning, leading to large increases in cases in South African and the UK. UK scientists are skilled at genomic sequencing - the technique used to track mutations of the virus. Thatâs the main reason these variants have been found quickly and acted upon, but just because other countries havenât detected them yet doesnât mean they arenât present. The faster they can be found, the more quickly they can be squashed. With hospital admissions rising to near levels of the spring peak and deaths increasing daily, ministers have no choice but to act quickly. Cutting social contact between people, tighter rules on travel and rapid testing â which is being rolled out to workers in care homes and is planned in schools and many local authorities â are the tools they are using to fight the virus on all fronts. In the last two weeks, California has seen half a million new coronavirus cases. On Tuesday, America's most populous state hit two million Covid-19 cases and more than 23,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University data. Officials now predict hospital admissions could reach 100,000 in January if the spread continues. The spike has left the state's health system overwhelmed. A number of intensive care facilities have been operating at over-maximum capacity, with less than 2% bed availability statewide. In Southern California, there is 0% ICU availability, local media report. The state is also seeing a shortage of medical staff - and is now turning outside the US, to places like Australia and Taiwan, to seek temporary medical workers, the AP reports. Health experts have continued to urge residents to practice social distancing during the rest of the holiday season, emphasising that hospitals may not be able to handle any further strain. The number of daily positive cases in the UK has hit another record high, with39,237,externalpositive cases reported in the past 24 hours. However, cases were thought to be higher in the UK during the spring peak when testing was much more limited. Government data shows a further 744 people have died within 28 days of a positive test. The total death toll now stands at 69,051. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Matt Hancock's message of hope at end of Christmas briefing Health Secretary Matt Hancock has urged the British public ""not to give up now"". ""We know what we can control this virus; we know that we can get through this together,"" he said, after announcing new tier restrictions to be imposed on large swathes of England from Boxing Day. ""I believe that everybody will do what is needed to keep themselves and others safe, especially this Christmas,"" he said. ""And I know, from the bottom of my heart, that there are brighter skies ahead."" Today's Downing Street briefing has now come to an end. Health Secretary Matt Hancock acknowledged that 2020 had been ""a hard year"" and despite all our efforts, the new variant of Covid-19 made further action ""difficult but necessary"". Here's what we learned at the press conference: The last question comes from Arj Singh from HuffPost. He asks if, given the highly-transmissible new variant, the government is guilty of overpromising by suggesting the UK can return to normality by Easter. Hancock replies that he is ""highly confident we will get things back to normal before 2022"" adding that the speed of the vaccine roll-out is accelerating. And that is the final question. Hancock wishes everyone a happy Christmas before leaving the lectern. Sam Lister from the Daily Express asks how many people will be vaccinated by Easter. Mr Hancock says he would love ""to have a stab at the answer"" but it depends hugely on the speed of production on the array of different vaccines that the UK has purchased. He says he does not want to put pressure on regulators in terms of approving the Astra-Zeneca Oxford vaccine, knowing that they will undertake their work as thoroughly as possible. He says the roll-out of the vaccine will be a ""big task"" for the NHS. ""The true answer will be as fast as we possibly can."" Dr Harries said we shouldn't jump to conclusions on transmission in schools Jane Merrick of the i asks why the whole country isn't going into lockdown. She also asks if, given evidence of increased infections among the under-15s, there is a case for mass testing in primary schools and a staggered return for primary schools as well as secondaries. Hancock says the new variant is highly concentrated and the new tier rules are aimed at keeping the variant in the South East. Dr Hopkins says ""we have no evidence this virus is more transmissible in children yet"". ""We will constantly take decisions with the experts in education over what is best for the children, along with controlling the virus,"" she adds. Dr Harries says: ""We shouldn't jump to the conclusion that just because every child is in school that it is a significant place for transmission."" Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent Will all of England end up in tier four? The health secretary says he wants action to be ""proportionate"" and that the
current tiers system is working. So that suggests more of ahopefully not,rather thannever. Wales has brought forward a lockdown. Northern Ireland will
enter one on Boxing Day. At the same time, mainland Scotland will go into the
tightest level of restrictions. Ministers in England are still trying to keep a
more local approach but, on future national measures, theyâre certainly not
ruling anything out. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,6.235442e-08
"The UK has detected two cases of another new variant of coronavirus, the health secretary Matt Hancock says. The cases in London and north west England are contacts of people who travelled to South Africa, where the variant was discovered. Travel restrictions with South Africa have been imposed. Anyone who has travelled there in the past fortnight, and anyone they have been in contact with, are being told to quarantine immediately. The variant has been causing mounting concern in South Africa, where health minister Zweli Mkhize warned that ""young, previously healthy people are now becoming very sick"". He said the country ""cannot go through what we went through in the early days of the Aids pandemic"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Scientists in South Africa say,externalthe variant has ""spread rapidly"" and became the dominant form of the virus in parts of the country. The variant is still being analysed, but the data are consistent with it spreading more quickly. It was detected for the first time in the UK on Tuesday. This variant shares some similarities to the one that hasalready been detected in the UK, although they have evolved separately. Both have a mutation - called N501Y - which is in a crucial part of the virus that it uses to infect the body's cells. Prof Neil Ferguson, from Imperial College London, said: ""I think the greatest concern of ours at the moment is the South African one. ""There's certainly anecdotal reports of explosive outbreaks for that virus and very steep increases in case numbers."" At the Downing Street press briefing, Mr Hancock said the new variant was ""highly concerning"" and that anyone told to quarantine must avoid ""all contact with any other person whatsoever"".

"Home for Christmas: travellers arriving at Belfast International Airport Health Minister Robin Swann says the Stormont executive's stay-at-home lockdown message will be made ""legally enforceable"". It comes after a request he made to the executive to ensure people abide by new rules taking effect on Saturday. It will mean people outside of their homes between 20:00 and 06:00 until 2 January, without a reasonable excuse, could be asked to return home. Mr Swann said the PSNI would be given ""additional"" enforcement powers. Initially the executive agreed the stay at home message would remain guidance rather than law. However Mr Swann said on Tuesday ministers supported his proposal to toughen this up. He told BBC Newsline: ""The regulations published tonight will see that go into regulation, the executive agreed to that yesterday and it is being worked through by the departmental solicitors' office to ensure it is legally enforceable. ""From 8pm to 6am that week, the police will have additional powers to enforce things."" Meanwhile, anyone travelling into Northern Ireland who plans to stay for at least 24 hours will have to self-isolate on arrival, according to the restrictions. The measures are containedin a newly published paper from the executive,external. However, the paper says that people who routinely cross the border for essential purposes will not be subject to restrictions. In Northern Ireland a further 21 coronavirus-related deaths were reported on Wednesday. The Department of Health's death toll is now 1,240. There were also a further 787 cases of Covid-19 diagnosed. Travellers entering Northern Ireland for 24 hours must self-isolate for 10 days The First Minister Arlene Foster has used her Christmas message to urge people to make ""common cause"" against the ""enemy of Covid"" but said there was also cause for hope. ""The United Kingdom has led the way in approving and providing the first vaccine,"" she said. ""Right now Northern Ireland has the highest vaccination rate in the UK and the world. ""More vaccines will follow, reinforcements in our fight against COVID."" The paper due to be published by the executive details the week-long ""stay-at-home curfew"" coming into force in NI on Boxing Day as well as new guidance around travel. The new guidance lists what qualifies as essential travel during that period of time including for work and health reasons. The guidance states that people should only travel within Northern Ireland when it is absolutely necessary. It says that essential travel includes: Returning home, if you are away from your permanent residence Work, when you cannot work from home Accessing health and social care services Accessing critical services Fulfilling essential caring responsibilities Buying essential goods or services in your local area Exercising an animal or going to the vet Fulfilling a legal obligation Providing emergency response services. On Sunday, theexecutive agreed so-called Christmas bubblesshould be limited to one day. The move followed action in England, Scotland and Wales on Saturday, cutting the previously agreed five days to just one. Earlier, the executive decided a new six-week lockdown must be introduced from 00.01 GMT on 26 December, which will be reviewed after four weeks. Northern Ireland's politicians are not in agreement on how to best handle the current level of risk. Sinn FÃ©in called for an all-Ireland-Great Britain travel ban and, in a late-night vote on Monday, the SDLP supported this. However, Alliance, the DUP and UUP voted against. How Northern Ireland's new restrictions affect you NI Covid-19 restrictions: Your questions answered Some 40 countries, including the Republic, havebanned UK arrivals due to concerns about the new variant. In the Republic of Ireland, anyone travelling from Britain must self-isolate for 14 days. That means staying in their room - regardless of negative test results - from the date of their arrival. There will be an increased Garda presence on Irish roads but road blocks will not be placed on the border to prevent travel between Northern Ireland and the Republic. Northern Ireland's new restrictions will come on the same day that the Department of Health advised people who are classed as clinically extremely vulnerable (CEV) to no longer attend work if they cannot work from home. It added that ""people are free to make their own judgements... depending on the Covid-security of their working environment"". Dr Michael McBride stressed this was not a return to shielding Chief medical officer Dr Michael McBride said: ""This strengthened advice is intended to offer enhanced protection from Covid-19 to the most vulnerable people in our society. ""It is not a return to shielding as we knew it at the outset of the pandemic. ""We are not advising CEV people to stay permanently indoors, and I would encourage CEV people to continue to go outside for exercise, provided they observe social distancing when they do so.""

"The UK has detected two cases of another new variant of coronavirus, the health secretary Matt Hancock says. The cases in London and north west England are contacts of people who travelled to South Africa, where the variant was discovered. Travel restrictions with South Africa have been imposed. Anyone who has travelled there in the past fortnight, and anyone they have been in contact with, are being told to quarantine immediately. The variant has been causing mounting concern in South Africa, where health minister Zweli Mkhize warned that ""young, previously healthy people are now becoming very sick"". He said the country ""cannot go through what we went through in the early days of the Aids pandemic"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Scientists in South Africa say,externalthe variant has ""spread rapidly"" and became the dominant form of the virus in parts of the country. The variant is still being analysed, but the data are consistent with it spreading more quickly. It was detected for the first time in the UK on Tuesday. This variant shares some similarities to the one that hasalready been detected in the UK, although they have evolved separately. Both have a mutation - called N501Y - which is in a crucial part of the virus that it uses to infect the body's cells. Prof Neil Ferguson, from Imperial College London, said: ""I think the greatest concern of ours at the moment is the South African one. ""There's certainly anecdotal reports of explosive outbreaks for that virus and very steep increases in case numbers."" At the Downing Street press briefing, Mr Hancock said the new variant was ""highly concerning"" and that anyone told to quarantine must avoid ""all contact with any other person whatsoever"". At the same briefing, he announced millions more people were beingmoved to Tier 4 on Boxing Dayin an effort to control the virus. New coronavirus variant: What do we know? Covid variant find âdue to work of UK scientistsâ What's happening to the numbers in Africa? Dr Susan Hopkins, from Public Health England (PHE), said ""both look like they are more transmissible"" but said they were ""still learning"" about the variant imported from South Africa. She said she was ""pretty confident"" the quarantine and travel rules would control the spread of the new variant. Prof Lawrence Young, from Warwick Medical School, said: ""The standard measures to restrict transmission (hands, face, space) will prevent infection with this variant. ""The move to harsher levels of restriction across the country is inevitable. "" FollowJameson Twitter,external By Farouk Chothia, BBC News The government tightened restrictions for the festive season, including closing beaches along the famous Garden Route in Western Cape province. It faced resistance from the main opposition party, the Democratic Alliance (DA), and some lobby groups, who challenged the decision in the courts, arguing that the closure of beaches would have a devastating effect on small businesses. But judges upheld the restrictions, saying the government had a duty to protect the health of people. Western Cape premier Alan Winde said hospitals in the province were under ""severe strain"". The province had more Covid-19 cases this time around than during the first wave. South Africa has so far recorded about 950,000 cases and more than 25,000 deaths - the highest in Africa.

"More than 50 countries had suspended routes to the UK because of the rapid spread of a new variant of Covid, but some of them have now lifted those restrictions. On 24 December, theUK banned travel from South Africaamid concerns over another new strain of the virus linked to that country. People who have transited through South Africa in the past 10 days will also be banned. However, UK and Irish nationals as well as the UK visa holders and permanent residents are exempt, but they will have to self-isolate for 10 days on arrival. It had already been pretty difficult to travel abroad - because of quarantine rules either at your destination or when returning to the UK. Here are some of the requirements currently in place. EU countries held discussions on Tuesday and decided to lift the compete travel ban, allowing national citizens, foreign residents and key workers to travel from the UK to their home country, if they have a negative Covid test. But EU countries are free to set their own rules on border controls, so the exact rules vary from country to country. France:French citizens, British nationals living in France and hauliers are among those able to travel again - if they have had a recent negative test. Rapid ""lateral flow"" tests  - which give results in about 30 minutes - will be accepted. Netherlands: Anyone arriving from the UK will need to have had a so-called PCR test to enter. These can take more than 24 hours to turn around, as they need to be processed in a lab. Belgium: Between 23 and 31 December, only those who are resident in Belgium, Belgian citizens and a limited number of strictly necessary journeys will be allowed from the UK. No prior test is necessary, but there will be strict controls on the Passenger Locator form and a quarantine of 7 days, followed by a compulsory PCR test. Spain: Flights from Britain have been stopped until further notice, except for those carrying Spanish citizens or people with Spanish residency. Travellers have to present a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours of arrival. Italy: Only Italian citizens will be allowed to return from the UK, along with those who urgently need to enter the country. They will have to have a PCR test before departing and spend two weeks in quarantine in Italy. Germany:Flights and passenger transport by rail, bus and ship is banned until 6 January. From 1 January 2021, transport operators can apply to the German authorities for an exemption to transport people who are resident in Germany. People arriving from the UK will need to either present a negative PCR test taken within 48 hours, or be tested when entering the country. Even with a negative test, travellers will have to self-isolate for 10 days, with the possibility for a test and release after five days Ireland:Passengers arriving by plane or ferry from England, Wales and Scotland are banned until 31 December, regardless of nationality. Essential workers are exempt China:Direct flights to and from the UK have been suspended indefinitely Canada:Passenger flights from the UK were stopped for 72 hours from midnight on Sunday (Monday 05:00 GMT), but on Christmas Eve the measure was extended indefinitely India:All flights from the UK are suspended until 31 December US:New York City has introduced quarantine rules for international travellers, who must stay for 14 days at the address they provided on arrival. Arrivals from the UK will be checked on by sheriff's deputies This isnot a complete list of countries, as so many have taken measures. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office hasupdates on the latest advice for UK travellers,externalto other countries. Many restrictions in place to limit the spread of coronavirus mean travel options are limited. InEngland, people who live in a tier four ""stay at home"" area or a tier three ""very high alert"" area have been told to avoid travel, including overnight stays, unless it is necessary. InWales, people can only travel internationally for essential reasons. From December 28, Wales will go in to a lockdown, meaning people should only leave their area for essential reasons. InNorthern Ireland, people have been told to ""avoid all unnecessary travel"" from 26 December, when a six-week lockdown starts. InScotland, people living in higher risk level three or four areas should avoid unnecessary travel. Most people arriving in the UK from many destinations - including British nationals - must quarantine for 10 days. Exceptions are made for the Common Travel Area - the Republic of Ireland, Channel Islands, or the Isle of Man - or people coming from countries in travel corridors with the UK. It means there have been only a small number of destinations with no restrictions at either end. What are the Covid regulations where you live? There are hopes that the newcoronavirus vaccineswill make travel to more destinations possible in the coming months. People arriving in England can now cut their quarantine period by at least half if they pay for a private Covid test after five days and it comes back negative. But the government will only allow certain test providers to take part in the scheme, and they havestruggled under the weight of demand. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has also suggested rapid testing - which can give a result in under an hour - could eventually""open the way"" for quarantine-free travel.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said Canada will have 168,000 doses by the end of the month. In the US, where the Covid case count has topped 18 million, the federal government has agreed to a $1.95bn deal with Pfizer for 100m doses. At least 70m will be delivered by 30 June. The US Centers for Disease Control reports that 4.6m doses have been delivered as of Monday, and more than 614,117 have been administered. BBC News Analysis Several counties in southern
England will
be put under tier four restrictions from Boxing Day. Other areas were also moved into a
higher tier as the government tries to contain the spread of the new variant of
Covid-19. All parts of England have been
placed in a tier depending on factors such as the speed at which the virus is
spreading or the strain on hospitals â four being the highest. Restrictions in these areas
include:  The whole of Wales has entered
another lockdown. Mainland Scotland and Northern Ireland start new lockdowns on
Boxing Day. Read more here. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Anyone singing In the Bleak
Midwinter may want to write another verse. Cases, numbers in hospital and
deaths are all going up. Itâs likely the NHS will soon be
dealing with more Covid patients than at the peak in April. The new variants are causing
concern â especially as the one detected first in the UK continued to spread
even during the November lockdown. Vaccines will be the solution, but
they take time to roll out and until then it is going to be rough. The only other tool we have to
stop the virus spreading is reducing our contacts with other people. Thatâs why millions more of us are
moving up the tiers on Boxing Day. The hope is that the night is darkest
before the dawn and that come Spring, the virusâs grip on our lives will start
to ease.  As we mentioned earlier, ministers in
Ireland are self-isolating and awaiting test results after a minister tested
positive. Charlie McConalogue displayed no

Matt Hancock said the variant was ""more transmissible and appears to have mutated further than the new variant that has been discovered in the UK"". In consequence, he said the government was quarantining the two cases found in the UK, as well as their close contacts. The UK government is also placing ""immediate restrictions"" on travel from South Africa. Mr Hancock said anyone who had been in South Africa in the past fortnight, or who had had contact with someone who had been in South Africa in the last two weeks, ""must quarantine immediately"".  Hundreds of immigrants in France
working on the coronavirus front line have been recognised with fast-track
citizenship. The interior ministry invited
residents helping with efforts against Covid-19 to apply for accelerated
naturalisation. More than 700 people, including healthcare
professionals, cleaners and shop workers, have already been granted citizenship
or are in the final stages of receiving it. Read more here Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News Just as weâve got used to the idea of one worrying variant of this coronavirus, another one comes along. The newest one, which has been brought from South Africa in recent weeks and infected two people in the UK, is âhighly concerningâ, says Health Secretary Matt Hancock. It comes hot on the heels of the discovery of another variant in Kent causing sharply rising cases in the south and east of England, which will mean strict tier four restrictions being introduced in more areas of England on Boxing Day. These are two different variants, but they have some similarities and share a mutation. Crucially they are both concerning, leading to large increases in cases in South African and the UK. UK scientists are skilled at genomic sequencing - the technique used to track mutations of the virus. Thatâs the main reason these variants have been found quickly and acted upon, but just because other countries havenât detected them yet doesnât mean they arenât present. The faster they can be found, the more quickly they can be squashed. With hospital admissions rising to near levels of the spring peak and deaths increasing daily, ministers have no choice but to act quickly. Cutting social contact between people, tighter rules on travel and rapid testing â which is being rolled out to workers in care homes and is planned in schools and many local authorities â are the tools they are using to fight the virus on all fronts. In the last two weeks, California has seen half a million new coronavirus cases. On Tuesday, America's most populous state hit two million Covid-19 cases and more than 23,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University data. Officials now predict hospital admissions could reach 100,000 in January if the spread continues. The spike has left the state's health system overwhelmed. A number of intensive care facilities have been operating at over-maximum capacity, with less than 2% bed availability statewide. In Southern California, there is 0% ICU availability, local media report. The state is also seeing a shortage of medical staff - and is now turning outside the US, to places like Australia and Taiwan, to seek temporary medical workers, the AP reports. Health experts have continued to urge residents to practice social distancing during the rest of the holiday season, emphasising that hospitals may not be able to handle any further strain. The number of daily positive cases in the UK has hit another record high, with39,237,externalpositive cases reported in the past 24 hours. However, cases were thought to be higher in the UK during the spring peak when testing was much more limited. Government data shows a further 744 people have died within 28 days of a positive test. The total death toll now stands at 69,051. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Matt Hancock's message of hope at end of Christmas briefing Health Secretary Matt Hancock has urged the British public ""not to give up now"". ""We know what we can control this virus; we know that we can get through this together,"" he said, after announcing new tier restrictions to be imposed on large swathes of England from Boxing Day. ""I believe that everybody will do what is needed to keep themselves and others safe, especially this Christmas,"" he said. ""And I know, from the bottom of my heart, that there are brighter skies ahead."" Today's Downing Street briefing has now come to an end. Health Secretary Matt Hancock acknowledged that 2020 had been ""a hard year"" and despite all our efforts, the new variant of Covid-19 made further action ""difficult but necessary"". Here's what we learned at the press conference: The last question comes from Arj Singh from HuffPost. He asks if, given the highly-transmissible new variant, the government is guilty of overpromising by suggesting the UK can return to normality by Easter. Hancock replies that he is ""highly confident we will get things back to normal before 2022"" adding that the speed of the vaccine roll-out is accelerating. And that is the final question. Hancock wishes everyone a happy Christmas before leaving the lectern. Sam Lister from the Daily Express asks how many people will be vaccinated by Easter. Mr Hancock says he would love ""to have a stab at the answer"" but it depends hugely on the speed of production on the array of different vaccines that the UK has purchased. He says he does not want to put pressure on regulators in terms of approving the Astra-Zeneca Oxford vaccine, knowing that they will undertake their work as thoroughly as possible. He says the roll-out of the vaccine will be a ""big task"" for the NHS. ""The true answer will be as fast as we possibly can."" Dr Harries said we shouldn't jump to conclusions on transmission in schools Jane Merrick of the i asks why the whole country isn't going into lockdown. She also asks if, given evidence of increased infections among the under-15s, there is a case for mass testing in primary schools and a staggered return for primary schools as well as secondaries. Hancock says the new variant is highly concentrated and the new tier rules are aimed at keeping the variant in the South East. Dr Hopkins says ""we have no evidence this virus is more transmissible in children yet"". ""We will constantly take decisions with the experts in education over what is best for the children, along with controlling the virus,"" she adds. Dr Harries says: ""We shouldn't jump to the conclusion that just because every child is in school that it is a significant place for transmission.""

"This video can not be played More tier 4 areas, a new variant and a message of hope - three things from the Downing Street press conference Six million more people in the east and south east of England are to enter tier four on Boxing Day, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has announced. The places moving into the highest level of restrictions - which include a ""stay at home"" order - border the areas already in tier four. A number of areas will also move up into tiers three and two. Mr Hancock also revealed thatanother new coronavirus variant from South Africa has been detected in the UK. He said anyone who had been there in the last two weeks must quarantine immediately. On Wednesday, a further 39,237 people in the UK tested positive for virus - an all-time high - and there were 744 deaths within 28 days of a positive test, according togovernment figures,external. However, cases were thought to be higher in the UK during the spring peak when testing was much more limited. What are you allowed to do in tier four areas? First trucks start leaving lorry park amid delays Will virus variant force the Nightingales to open? The health secretary told the Downing Street briefing the old tiering system was not enough to control the new variant of the virus. Across the country, cases have risen 57% in the last week, he said, and hospital admissions are at their highest level since mid-April. The rises have been in places neighbouring areas already in tier four, he said, adding that East Anglia had seen a ""significant number"" of cases caused by the new fast-spreading variant. Areas moving to tier four are:Sussex, Oxfordshire, Suffolk, Norfolk, Cambridgeshire, Hampshire, with the exception of the New Forest, and the parts ofEssexandSurreynot already in the toughest restrictions. The additional six million going into tier four takes the total number of people under the toughest restrictions to 24 million, or 43% of England's population. A further 24.8 million will be in tier three. Mr Hancock said: ""This Christmas and the start of 2021 is going to be tough. The new variant makes everything much harder because it spreads so much faster. ""But we mustn't give up now, we know that we can control this virus, we know we can get through this together, we're going to get through it by suppressing the virus until a vaccine can make us safe."" Under tier four, non-essential shops, gyms, hairdressers and indoor entertainment venues must close. People in these areas also cannot meet other people indoors, unless they live with them or they are part of their support bubble, even on Christmas Day, when rules on household mixing are relaxed across the rest of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Mr Hancock also announced that other areas would move into higher tiers. Areas moving to tier three are:Bristol, Gloucestershire, Somerset, including theNorth Somerset council area, Swindon, the Isle of Wight, the New Forest and Northamptonshire as well as Cheshire and Warrington. Cornwall and Herefordshirewill move into tier two. The UK's devolved administrations have alsotightened restrictions to combat a rise in cases, withWales going into another lockdown earlier than plannedover the weekend. MainlandScotlandandNorthern Irelandstart new lockdowns on Boxing Day. The British Medical Association union said the new restrictions in England were a ""necessary step to control the virus and prevent the NHS from being overwhelmed"". But the British Retail Consortium called on the government to extend the business rates holiday for retailers and the hospitality sector beyond April next year. The trade body also said testing should be increased and the vaccination programme ""stepped up"". Anyone singing In the Bleak Midwinter may want to write another verse. It's likely the NHS will soon be dealing with more Covid patients than at the peak in April. The new variants are causing concern - especially as the one detected first in the UK continued to spread even during the November lockdown. And cases, numbers in hospital and deaths are all going up. Vaccines will be the solution, but they take time to roll out and until then it is going to be rough. The only other tool we have to stop the virus spreading is reducing our contacts with other people. That's why millions more of us are moving up the tiers on Boxing Day. The hope is that come spring the virus's grip on our lives will start to ease. The health secretary also said two cases have been detected of another new variant of the coronavirus in the UK. Both were contacts of cases who have travelled from South Africa over the past few weeks, he said. He said: ""This new variant is highly concerning because it is yet more transmissible and it appears to have mutated further than the new variant that has been discovered in the UK."" The health secretary said both cases and close contacts of the cases have been quarantined. There are immediate restrictions on travel from South Africa and the government is telling those who have been in contact with anyone who has been in South Africa in the last fortnight that they must quarantine. The measures were temporary, he said, while the new variant was analysed by scientists at the government's research centre at Porton Down. SOCIAL DISTANCING:Can I give my friends a hug? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? The health secretary also announced an expansion of mass testing and the vaccination programme. Community testing will carried out in areas with the highest infection rates, he said, with 116 areas signing up. Vaccinations have now begun in care homes, Mr Hancock said, with Chelsea pensioners among those set to receive the jab. Mr Hancock also revealed the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine has now submitted full data to the regulator for approval. He said: ""Amid all this difficulty, the great hope for 2021 is of course the vaccine. ""The vaccine is our route out of all this and however tough this Christmas and this winter is going to be, we know that the transforming force of science is helping to find a way through"", he said. It comes as thefirst trucks began leaving a temporary lorry park in Kent, where they had been stuck since France closed its UK border on Sunday amid concern about the new variant. France has ended its ban on UK arrivals on condition of them having a negative coronavirus test less than 72 hours before departure. On Wednesday, Northern Ireland becamethe latest country to confirm the presence of the new strain. It has already been detected in England, Scotland and Wales, as well as a number of countries on the continent.

"Marston's is to take over the running of Brains pubs in a bid to save 1,300 jobs in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. The pub operator will take over the running of all 156 of the brewer's pubs, mainly in Wales. Brains said restrictions during the pandemic had put the business under ""significant financial pressure"". Chief executive Alistair Darby said the long-term agreement safeguarded 1,300 pub jobs. Under the agreement, Marston's will pay rent for the entire estate but keep the Brains name while running the pubs as a tenant. All pubs in Wales have been forced to close as the country battles the pandemic Brains closed more than 100 of its pubs after theWelsh Government announced an alcohol ban in pubs and restaurants at the start of Decemberin a bid curb the spread of the virus. On Saturday all pubs were forced to close their doors in the final days before Christmas as Wales entered a level four national lockdown. Last month the 138-year-old firm suggested the previous firebreak lockdown had cost it Â£1.6m. Fear pubs will 'go bust' unless rules relaxed Cardiff brewer Brains gets rid of 36,000 pints of beer The deal, which is expected to close in February, will add to Marston's 1,368 pubs in the UK, including 106 in Wales. Back in March, Brains announced plans tosell 40 of its pubs with workers warned of potential job losses due to economic uncertainty caused by Brexit. Ralph Findlay, Chief Executive of Marston's, said the pubs were a ""great fit"" within the operator's existing estate. ""We look forward to the pub teams joining us and to welcoming guests and the communities which they serve, back into these pubs as the country emerges from the pandemic over the weeks and months ahead,"" he said. The Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA) said the deal brought hope the pubs would survive, but added it would be disappointed if it marked steps towards closing the Cardiff brewery. ""It will be interesting to see what the details of this deal are, how the Marston's beer will sit alongside the Brains beer, and what the future is for the brewery itself,"" said CEO of CAMRA Tom Stainer. He added: ""This is good news, as we were worried that these pubs would be closed permanently, or sold for property development or non-pub use.""

"The UK has detected two cases of another new variant of coronavirus, the health secretary Matt Hancock says. The cases in London and north west England are contacts of people who travelled to South Africa, where the variant was discovered. Travel restrictions with South Africa have been imposed. Anyone who has travelled there in the past fortnight, and anyone they have been in contact with, are being told to quarantine immediately. The variant has been causing mounting concern in South Africa, where health minister Zweli Mkhize warned that ""young, previously healthy people are now becoming very sick"".

Scientists in South Africa say,externalthe variant has ""spread rapidly"" and became the dominant form of the virus in parts of the country. The variant is still being analysed, but the data are consistent with it spreading more quickly. It was detected for the first time in the UK on Tuesday. This variant shares some similarities to the one that hasalready been detected in the UK, although they have evolved separately. Both have a mutation - called N501Y - which is in a crucial part of the virus that it uses to infect the body's cells. Prof Neil Ferguson, from Imperial College London, said: ""I think the greatest concern of ours at the moment is the South African one. ""There's certainly anecdotal reports of explosive outbreaks for that virus and very steep increases in case numbers."" At the Downing Street press briefing, Mr Hancock said the new variant was ""highly concerning"" and that anyone told to quarantine must avoid ""all contact with any other person whatsoever"".

"How did Grenfell Tower come to be covered in combustible materials when it was refurbished? That's the question the public inquiry into the west London fire in June 2017 which killed 72 people has been asking. This year the inquiry has heard more than 400 hours of evidence, from 53 witnesses. The team behind the BBC's Grenfell Tower Inquiry podcast has reported on all of it. Here's what we've learned. Two types of combustible plastic foam insulation were used on the outside of Grenfell Tower. Staff from Celotex, which made the majority of the insulation, say they behaved unethically, dishonestly and the company lied for commercial gainwhile getting their product approved for use on high-rise buildings. Combustible insulation could be used in these situations only if it passed a large-scale fire test. The inquiry was told Celotex added a non-combustible material to its test, to ensure flames would not reach the company's insulation. It hid the material's use from the fire test report, official certification bodies and even the company's sales staff. The second company involved was the market leader, Kingspan. For 14 years Kingspan's insulation was sold for use on high-rise buildings without a relevant large-scale fire test. Its insulation passed a test in 2005 but Kingspan changed the product a year later. Subsequent tests turned into a ""raging inferno"". Kingspan continued to sell its insulation using the 2005 test on the old material. This test was only withdrawn in October 2020 after the company accepted it did not represent the product on sale. When one company questioned Kingspan's approach to sales,technical manager Philip Heath wrote to friends to say they had confused him ""with someone who gives a damn"". Philip Heath apologised for the email and said he was ""in a dark place"" at the time he sent it because one of the friends he was messaging was terminally ill. Some witnesses didn't have a full grasp of the building regulations. The lead architect had never heard the phrase limited combustibility - the standard recommended for insulation on high-rise buildings. Others have told the inquiry they thought regulations were ambiguous. One fire test measured the spread of flame across the surface of a product. Those which performed the best were awarded a classification of Class 0. Kingspan took the surface off their insulation, a piece of foil thinner than a millimetre, and tested that on its own. Then they advertised their whole insulation product as Class 0 - a standard which it did not achieve. They told the inquiry this was permissible under testing criteria for England and Wales. Lead counsel to the inquiry, Richard Millett, suggested that using Kingspan's interpretation of the regulations, a stick of dynamite wrapped in foil could also be advertised as Class 0. Lead counsel to the inquiry Richard Millett hasaccused witnesses of taking part in a ""merry go-round of buck passing"".He said the public ""would be forced to conclude that everyone involved in the refurbishment of Grenfell Tower did what they were supposed to do and nobody made any serious or causative mistakes"". The inquiry heard how 17 companies worked on the refurbishment through a complex web of contracting and subcontracting. In evidence, witnesses said they thought other companies were responsible for fire safety. Specialist cladding contractor Harley sent its drawings to architecture firm Studio E. Harley witnesses told the inquiry they thought the architects were checking that designs met regulations. Studio E said it thought it only had to examine the building's aesthetics and 'functional utility'. Parts of the drawings which breached regulations slipped through these gaps. Construction professionals often relied on meetings with sales staff to decide whether a material was suitable for use. Celotex's marketing department wrote that those most likely to buy its insulation included anyone who wasn't aware there were restrictionson which materials were permitted for use on high-rise buildings. The fire broke out in the kitchen of a fourth floor flat in the 23-storey tower block just before 01:00 Celotex and Kingspan staff admitted their marketing material was misleading. Large-scale fire tests approved entire cladding systems, not individual products. But Kingspan and Celotex marketed their insulation as ""suitable for buildings over 18 metres in height"". Jonathan Roper of Celotex admitted this was deliberate and misleading. Philip Heath of Kingspan said he thought the company's marketing encouraged clients to contact them for more details. The inquiry heard evidence that on at least one occasion when this happened Kingspan then gave inaccurate evidence. Grenfell Tower was run by Kensington and Chelsea's Tenant Management Organisation (TMO). It hired companies for the Grenfell Tower refurbishment. The TMO hired architects Studio E who had never clad a high-rise residential building before. (The firm had designed the school and leisure centre opposite Grenfell.) Under EU rules, expensive public projects were subject to a competitive tender process.  When hiring Studio E, TMO staff admitted that they expected the fees would be under Â£174,000, so they wouldn't have to go through this. Studio E has admitted that had there been a competitive tender process, it would not have won it. While appointing a main contractor the TMO breached EU procurement rules by informing one of the companies, Rydon, it was in pole position to win the work before the results were officially announced. The TMO acknowledges this created a 'risk of challenge' but says it was not illegal. TMO staff held a ""secret"" meeting with Rydon to discuss how to cut Â£800,000 in costs from the budget.This included using cheaper cladding materials. The TMO insists this was subject to the agreement of planners. One of the aims of the refurbishment was to improve the energy efficiency of the tower. A company called Max Fordham gave Grenfell an ""aspirational"" target of making the 1970s concrete block as efficient as a new build project. Max Fordham suggested two insulation materials that could achieve this.But they did not check the building regulation guidance to see if the products could be used. The architects, Studio E, also made no checks to see whether the combustible materials were compliant with building regulations. It described any concerns its staff may have had about the compliance of the insulation as an ""afterthought"". Many witnesses are asked whether, if they had their time again, they would do anything differently.Terry Ashton, who worked for the fire safety consultants Exova, was clear - he would have asked more questions. Exova completed three fire safety strategies for the Grenfell Tower refurbishment. None of them even acknowledged the crucial fact that the refurbishment involved cladding the outside of the building. Seventy-two people died as a result of the fire Mr Ashton said he would have expected the architects to have directly asked him to consider the safety of the cladding products. They did not, so he didn't. Other Exova staff failed to clarify missing information. Exova's fire safety strategy for the existing building used the word ""assumed"" 19 times in a 16-page report. After the fire, when investigators looked at the cladding that had been installed on Grenfell Tower, they found a catalogue of errors related to how it had been installed. Many cavity barriers - intended to stop fire spreading through cladding -  were poorly fitted or installed in the wrong place. Some were attached back to front, stopping them working. The company responsible for installing the cladding,Osborne Berry, admitted there were examples of unacceptable poor workmanship which should have been ripped out and redone. Grenfell Tower had new windows fitted. During the installation Rydon instructed its subcontractors, SD Plastering, to fill gaps around the windows with combustible insulation. They said neither knew it was combustible. On the night of the fire, this was the main route for the flames to spread into the cladding. Kensington and Chelsea's building control department approved the construction of the Grenfell refurbishment. The officer responsible accepted that his efforts fell below the standards of a reasonably competent building control inspector. John Hoban did not notice that cavity barriers had not been designed around the windows to stop flames spreading to the outside wall. He failed to recognise the cladding materials were not suitable for use together on high-rise buildings. Mr Hoban told the inquiry that as a result of local authority cuts, he was juggling up to 130 projects. A clerk of works was hired to inspect the work carried out on the cladding. His company charged more than Â£400 a day, but he said his remit was not to check whether the work met regulations, or matched architects' drawings.Jonathan White said he only checked that work was neat and tidy. The TMO consulted residents about plans for the building. TMO newsletters claimed there was ""no concern from residents about cladding the building"". But that was based on a meeting which just one resident attended. Information about fire retardancy was not given to residents. During the refurbishment, people complained about the standard of work.The project lead for the main contractor Rydon said the company and other contractors were under massive pressure from ""rebel residents"". During evidence he repeatedly called the residents of Grenfell Tower ""vocal"" and ""aggressive"". Complaints were also made about construction staff who knocked on windows asking for cups of tea, scared pets and dropped materials onto a public footpath. In January the inquiry expects to hear evidence from Arconic, which made the cladding panels. The inquiry has already found the product, with a combustible polyethylene core, was the main cause of the spread of the fire. Campaigners delivered a message to the French embassy in London urging witnesses for cladding firm Arconic residing in France to give evidence A lawyer who represents some of the bereaved, survivors and residents has described Arconic (along with the insulation manufacturers Celotex and Kingspan) as ""little more than crooks and killers""who ""knew their material would burn with lethal speed"". The inquiry has heard that in 2009, a senior Arconic employee called polyethylene cores ""dangerous"".

"Ministers are deciding whether more areas of England should be placed under the toughest coronavirus restrictions in a bid to contain the spread of a new variant of Covid-19. Cabinet minister Robert Jenrick said No 10 would make a judgement on whether the current rules were strong enough. He said there was no immediate plan to widen curbs on Boxing Day but ""the number of cases is rising"". Health Secretary Matt Hancock will lead a Downing Street briefing at 15:00 GMT. He will be joined by England's deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries and Dr Susan Hopkins of Public Health England. The Covid operations committee, chaired by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, has been discussing the tiered system - earlier than the 30 December official review date - amid concern over the rapid spread of the new variant. The latest change to restrictions placed London and large parts of south-east Englandunder new tier four rules, as millions saw theirfestive plans scrapped or severely restricted. It comes as the UK's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance previously warned that extra curbs were likely to be needed in more areas of England to control the new variant. Hetold a Downing Street briefing on Mondaythat measures could ""need to be increased in some places, in due course, not reduced"". Mr Jenrick said earlier that ministers were ""trying to retain the robust tiered system"" which takes a ""proportionate approach"" across the country, but said it had been designed before the new Covid variant became apparent. UK-France services return as travel ban eased Tighter Covid rules likely, top adviser warns Will virus variant force the Nightingales to open? He said the variant - whichcould be up to 70% more transmissiblethan previous strains - was now present in other areas of the country, albeit to a ""lesser extent"" than in London, south-east and the east of England. He said: ""The tiered system was designed before we knew the full ferocity of the new variant, and so we have to make sure it's sufficiently robust to be able to withstand this and to stop cases rising at the very worrying levels they are now in parts of the country."" Prof Neil Ferguson, whose scientific modelling led to the March lockdown, said the variant is ""everywhere now"" but said he anticipated that tier four restrictions and stricter rules over Christmas elsewhere could have a beneficial impact. He told the Commons Science and Technology Committee: ""Schools are now shut, we are in a near-lockdown situation across the country. Contact rates are lower over Christmas. ""I expect, though I hesitate to make any sort of predictions, we will see a flattening of the curve in the next two weeks. We will see at least a slowing of growth. ""The critical question is what happens in January and the extent we want to make public health measures more uniform across the country if the new variant is everywhere."" The UK's R value - the number of people thatone infected person will pass on a virus to, on average - is thought to have risen slightly to between 1.1 and 1.3 - up from 1.1 and 1.2 the week prior, according to the latest data published by the Government Office for Science and the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). On Tuesday, a further 36,804 people in the UK tested positive for the virus and there were 691 deaths within 28 days of a positive test, according togovernment figures.,external It is the largest daily number of cases recorded yet, though it is thought the infection rate was higher during the first peak in spring when testing was much more limited. The UK's devolved administrations have alsotightened restrictions to combat a rise in cases, withWales going into another lockdown earlier than plannedover the weekend. MainlandScotlandandNorthern Irelandstart new lockdowns on Boxing Day. SOCIAL DISTANCING:Can I give my friends a hug? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? Mr Jenrick said decisions from the committee would be communicated ""as soon as we can"" and that there was ""absolutely no plan"" at the moment to change restrictions before Christmas Day. Under the revisedChristmas rulesfor England, only people living in tiers one to three are permitted to socialise in a bubble of three households on 25 December. Those in tier four areas must only celebrate Christmas with members of their own household and support bubble. They will not be allowed to travel to other tiers to see family and friends. Mr Jenrick said the PM had been ""very clear"" that even outside of tier four, there was a ""strong degree of personal judgment to be exercised here"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""It's still up to people to come to a conclusion as to how many members of their family or other households they want to bring together on Christmas Day. ""The strong advice is to keep it small, to keep it short and therefore to be safe."" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has written to Mr Johnson to say his party will back any government moves to tighten restrictions if that is what scientists recommend. On Wednesday, Shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth urged the prime minister to act before it's too late. He told BBC Breakfast: ""What we're saying to Boris Johnson is, last time you received advice from the scientists for tougher restrictions, you sat on it, you dithered, you delayed."" He urged the PM not to ""sit on the advice this time"", adding ""we know delaying has devastating consequences. ""If you're advised to take tougher action, take it, do it, act with speed, don't be behind the curve again."" The Labour leader of Crawley Borough Council, which is currently in tier two but bordering tier four areas, has said the area would be hit hard by a potential tightening of restrictions, and accused the government of failing to provide support. Cllr Peter Lamb told BBC News that Crawley ""might"" be placed in a higher tier, adding that case numbers there ""would suggest that if it's not going in now, it will be going in at some point in the near future"". He said there had been ""no coming back"" for Crawley - which includes Gatwick airport - since the March lockdown, and it was ""still waiting"" for the government to ""give us some support to get through this"", adding that more businesses would be impacted if the area was placed under the toughest measures.

"The hospital was built in nine days, with the help of up to 200 soldiers a day There is mounting pressure on hospitals, with growing numbers being admitted each day. The fastest growth is being seen in London and the South East, where the new coronavirus variant is believed to be behind a rise in cases. Normally the UK would expect to see about 1,000 new respiratory-related admissions a day in total at this time of year. It is already close to double that for Covid alone. University College London clinical research director Prof Christina Pagel says the situation is ""alarming"". She predicts that by the end of next week, the NHS could exceed the total numbers seen in hospital in the peak in the spring, putting immense strain on the NHS at the busiest time of year. The growing pressure has prompted many to start wondering why the Nightingales have not been opened. Tory MP John Redwood has been vocal on Twitter calling for them to be put to use. These, after all, were the network of emergency field hospitals built during the spring to cope when hospitals could not - most were not used. There are seven in England. Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales established their own field hospitals but these were not known as Nightingales. Wales has now decomissioned its 2,000-bed field hospital, which was at the Principality Stadium, although it has anetwork of smaller sites are now available, some of which are linked to existing hospitals. A number of these are treating Covid patients. But of the original sites only two - one in Exeter and one in Belfast - are currently taking Covid patients. Manchester's is being used for non-Covid patients who are in the final stages of recovery, while the centres in Harrogate and Glasgow are carrying out diagnostic tests and outpatient appointments. Harrogate's Nightingale is being used for diagnostic testing Why, if the NHS is under so much pressure, are others not open? The simple answer, says British Medical Association leader Dr Chaand Nagpaul, is staffing. ""We have 80,000 vacancies. You just can't have a doctor or nurse in two sites at once."" It is a sentiment that is echoed on the ground. Rupert Pearse, an intensive care doctor in east London, said the situation in the capital as well as in north Kent and south Wales ""remains very difficult"". But he says the Nightingales will not help because of the lack of trained staff. ""We are already 'diluting' our skilled ICU nursing staff with less-well-trained volunteers."" The truth is they were built as an insurance option - to be used as a last resort. So instead hospitals have focused on managing demand. That means a ruthless prioritisation of care. Routine work, such as knee and hip replacements, has been cancelled in the areas that are facing the most pressure to free up space. That is why it is no coincidence - despite the variation in Covid cases across the country - that regionally, hospitals have very similar levels of occupied beds once you take into account Covid and non-Covid patients. Hospitals have been carefully managing demand to ensure they have a bit of wriggle room available. But there is, of course, a limit to how long that can work. Even then though doubts remain about how much use the Nightingales will be. As well as staffing, some have argued there is just not the equipment available to treat the sickest patients, who can suffer everything from blood clotting to multiple organ failure. ""We can given them oxygen, but that's about it,"" said one doctor who worked in one of the Nightingales in the first wave. ""In some there are not even appropriate toilet facilities. They were built in a rush because we were desperate."" Despite the problems, Chris Hopson of NHS Providers, which represents hospital trusts, believes it was still the right decision to build them. ""Remember in the spring, Italian hospitals in Lombardy were overwhelmed. ""We needed an insurance policy in case that happened."" He says even without the complex equipment, they could still have a role given many patients are now treated on general wards with oxygen therapy. But he says the NHS will use ""every ounce"" of existing capacity it can muster before the Nightingales are used routinely. He predicts the next 10 to 15 days will be crucial - and if the numbers coming into hospital do not start dropping, hospitals could find themselves getting very close to the limit. ""If we don't end up using them, we should think of that as a success,"" he added.

Canada's health agency authorised the Moderna vaccine on Wednesday, saying in a release that ""after a thorough, independent review of the evidence, it has determined that the Moderna vaccine meets the departmentâs stringent safety, efficacy and quality requirements"". Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said Canada will have 168,000 doses by the end of the month. In the US, where the Covid case count has topped 18 million, the federal government has agreed to a $1.95bn deal with Pfizer for 100m doses. At least 70m will be delivered by 30 June. The US Centers for Disease Control reports that 4.6m doses have been delivered as of Monday, and more than 614,117 have been administered. BBC News Analysis Several counties in southern
England will
be put under tier four restrictions from Boxing Day. Other areas were also moved into a
higher tier as the government tries to contain the spread of the new variant of
Covid-19. All parts of England have been
placed in a tier depending on factors such as the speed at which the virus is
spreading or the strain on hospitals â four being the highest. Restrictions in these areas
include:  The whole of Wales has entered
another lockdown. Mainland Scotland and Northern Ireland start new lockdowns on
Boxing Day. Read more here. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Anyone singing In the Bleak
Midwinter may want to write another verse. Cases, numbers in hospital and
deaths are all going up. Itâs likely the NHS will soon be
dealing with more Covid patients than at the peak in April. The new variants are causing
concern â especially as the one detected first in the UK continued to spread
even during the November lockdown. Vaccines will be the solution, but
they take time to roll out and until then it is going to be rough. The only other tool we have to
stop the virus spreading is reducing our contacts with other people. Thatâs why millions more of us are
moving up the tiers on Boxing Day. The hope is that the night is darkest
before the dawn and that come Spring, the virusâs grip on our lives will start
to ease.  As we mentioned earlier, ministers in
Ireland are self-isolating and awaiting test results after a minister tested
positive. Charlie McConalogue displayed no
symptoms but is self-isolating, his spokesman told the Irish Times. He received his test result several hours
after attending a cabinet meeting. The agriculture minister had been in
Brussels on government business over the last few days and was tested on his
return, according to broadcaster RTÃ. Read more here The first trucks have started leaving a temporary lorry park in Kent after France reopened its border with the UK. It follows clashes with between frustrated hauliers and police, as drivers have become increasingly impatient to get home for Christmas. France has lifted its ban on some UK arrivals, but only if they can show proof of a negative Covid test taken less than 72 hours before departure. ""We are very tired. We're staying in cars, we don't have a lot of food, no money,"" one lorry driver told the BBC. ""We just want to do the test and just go straight home,"" said another. A huge backlog of traffic remains. It all adds to the pressure on the authorities to get as many tests done as quickly as possible. Read more.  Members of New York Cityâs Sheriffâs office

Members of Maidenhead's KhalsaAid travelled 80 miles (130km) to take food to drivers hit by delays at the border. On Tuesday, some of the Sikh charity's LangarAid members travelled almost double the distance, from Coventry, to bring water and food.

This video can not be played Covid: Variant from SA 'yet more transmissible' The health secretary has described the new variant of coronavirus which came to light in South Africa as "" highly concerning"". Matt Hancock said the variant was ""more transmissible and appears to have mutated further than the new variant that has been discovered in the UK"". In consequence, he said the government was quarantining the two cases found in the UK, as well as their close contacts. The UK government is also placing ""immediate restrictions"" on travel from South Africa. Mr Hancock said anyone who had been in South Africa in the past fortnight, or who had had contact with someone who had been in South Africa in the last two weeks, ""must quarantine immediately"".  Hundreds of immigrants in France
working on the coronavirus front line have been recognised with fast-track
citizenship. The interior ministry invited
residents helping with efforts against Covid-19 to apply for accelerated
naturalisation. More than 700 people, including healthcare
professionals, cleaners and shop workers, have already been granted citizenship
or are in the final stages of receiving it. Read more here Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News Just as weâve got used to the idea of one worrying variant of this coronavirus, another one comes along. The newest one, which has been brought from South Africa in recent weeks and infected two people in the UK, is âhighly concerningâ, says Health Secretary Matt Hancock. It comes hot on the heels of the discovery of another variant in Kent causing sharply rising cases in the south and east of England, which will mean strict tier four restrictions being introduced in more areas of England on Boxing Day. These are two different variants, but they have some similarities and share a mutation. Crucially they are both concerning, leading to large increases in cases in South African and the UK. UK scientists are skilled at genomic sequencing - the technique used to track mutations of the virus. Thatâs the main reason these variants have been found quickly and acted upon, but just because other countries havenât detected them yet doesnât mean they arenât present. The faster they can be found, the more quickly they can be squashed. With hospital admissions rising to near levels of the spring peak and deaths increasing daily, ministers have no choice but to act quickly. Cutting social contact between people, tighter rules on travel and rapid testing â which is being rolled out to workers in care homes and is planned in schools and many local authorities â are the tools they are using to fight the virus on all fronts. In the last two weeks, California has seen half a million new coronavirus cases. On Tuesday, America's most populous state hit two million Covid-19 cases and more than 23,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University data. Officials now predict hospital admissions could reach 100,000 in January if the spread continues. The spike has left the state's health system overwhelmed. A number of intensive care facilities have been operating at over-maximum capacity, with less than 2% bed availability statewide. In Southern California, there is 0% ICU availability, local media report. The state is also seeing a shortage of medical staff - and is now turning outside the US, to places like Australia and Taiwan, to seek temporary medical workers, the AP reports. Health experts have continued to urge residents to practice social distancing during the rest of the holiday season, emphasising that hospitals may not be able to handle any further strain. The number of daily positive cases in the UK has hit another record high, with39,237,externalpositive cases reported in the past 24 hours. However, cases were thought to be higher in the UK during the spring peak when testing was much more limited. Government data shows a further 744 people have died within 28 days of a positive test. The total death toll now stands at 69,051. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Matt Hancock's message of hope at end of Christmas briefing Health Secretary Matt Hancock has urged the British public ""not to give up now"". ""We know what we can control this virus; we know that we can get through this together,"" he said, after announcing new tier restrictions to be imposed on large swathes of England from Boxing Day. ""I believe that everybody will do what is needed to keep themselves and others safe, especially this Christmas,"" he said. ""And I know, from the bottom of my heart, that there are brighter skies ahead."" Today's Downing Street briefing has now come to an end. Health Secretary Matt Hancock acknowledged that 2020 had been ""a hard year"" and despite all our efforts, the new variant of Covid-19 made further action ""difficult but necessary"". Here's what we learned at the press conference: The last question comes from Arj Singh from HuffPost. He asks if, given the highly-transmissible new variant, the government is guilty of overpromising by suggesting the UK can return to normality by Easter. Hancock replies that he is ""highly confident we will get things back to normal before 2022"" adding that the speed of the vaccine roll-out is accelerating. And that is the final question. Hancock wishes everyone a happy Christmas before leaving the lectern. Sam Lister from the Daily Express asks how many people will be vaccinated by Easter. Mr Hancock says he would love ""to have a stab at the answer"" but it depends hugely on the speed of production on the array of different vaccines that the UK has purchased. He says he does not want to put pressure on regulators in terms of approving the Astra-Zeneca Oxford vaccine, knowing that they will undertake their work as thoroughly as possible. He says the roll-out of the vaccine will be a ""big task"" for the NHS. ""The true answer will be as fast as we possibly can."" Dr Harries said we shouldn't jump to conclusions on transmission in schools Jane Merrick of the i asks why the whole country isn't going into lockdown. She also asks if, given evidence of increased infections among the under-15s, there is a case for mass testing in primary schools and a staggered return for primary schools as well as secondaries. Hancock says the new variant is highly concentrated and the new tier rules are aimed at keeping the variant in the South East. Dr Hopkins says ""we have no evidence this virus is more transmissible in children yet"". ""We will constantly take decisions with the experts in education over what is best for the children, along with controlling the virus,"" she adds. Dr Harries says: ""We shouldn't jump to the conclusion that just because every child is in school that it is a significant place for transmission."" Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent Will all of England end up in tier four? The health secretary says he wants action to be ""proportionate"" and that the
current tiers system is working. So that suggests more of ahopefully not,rather thannever. Wales has brought forward a lockdown. Northern Ireland will
enter one on Boxing Day. At the same time, mainland Scotland will go into the
tightest level of restrictions. Ministers in England are still trying to keep a
more local approach but, on future national measures, theyâre certainly not
ruling anything out. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,0.0029286905
"This video can not be played Some drivers complained about unsanitary conditions and a lack of food Lorry drivers who have tested negative for coronavirus have begun boarding ferries at the port of Dover after France reopened its border with the UK. Some 3,800 lorries have been parked up in Kent after France closed its UK border on Sunday amid concern over a fast-spreading variant of the virus. France ended its ban on UK arrivals on Wednesday, on the condition that people were tested before travelling. Earlier, police clashed with drivers who have spent days in their cabs. Transport Secretary Grant Shappswarned there were ""severe delays"",externaland urged people to avoid travelling to Kent. Around 50 countries imposed a ban after the UK warned of anew, fast-spreading variant of coronavirus. 'We are tired, we are disappointed, we are scared' Life on the road for truckers amid ports chaos New variant could be circulating outside UK The French government's ban, introduced on Sunday, has now been eased toallow French citizens, British nationals living in France and hauliers to travel- if they test negative less than 72 hours before departure. Soldiers have joined NHS Test and Trace staff in Kent to carry out rapid tests on thousands of stranded lorry drivers. But Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said it could take ""a few days"" to clear the backlog. Lorry drivers will have to prove they have tested negative for coronavirus before travelling A number of drivers clashed with police this morning, with officers trying to push back a small crowd trying to enter the Port of Dover. Kent Police said one man is in custody after being arrested for obstructing a highway in Dover and there have been disturbances at Manston Airport, where a lorry-holding facility run by the Department for Transport is now full. The entrance to the Port of Dover is currently closed with a line of police officers blocking it, BBC reporter Amanda Akass said. They told her they will not start allowing vehicles through until ""protesters"" - several dozen drivers - move from the roundabout at the entrance. But the drivers have said they will not move as they do not want to go to the back of the queue and cannot move as the road is blocked in both directions. One driver told the BBC he is tired and does not have much food. ""We are very tired. We're staying in cars, we don't have a lot of food, no money,"" one driver told the BBC. ""Police three days ago told us that testing will start soon, but they don't know when and that's why people are protesting,"" another said. ""We just want to do the test and just go straight home."" Rod McKenzie of the Road Haulage Association described the situation as ""chaos"" as lorry drivers headed to ports thinking the borders would be open. ""They're tired, frustrated, desperately wanting to get home for Christmas,"" he said. He said the information given to them has been ""extremely poor"", while food provision, toilets and washing facilities were ""inadequate"". Richard Lloyd, director of a British firm that imports farm machinery from Poland, said he had been called by the family of a driver who was stuck without food, asking whether he could get a loaf of bread to the lorry. ""He didn't want to go anywhere because of the security of the truck, and obviously a place in the queue, so it was a desperate situation,"" Mr Lloyd said. The government says free food and water is being provided. A statement said there are 12 food trucks at Manston Airport and eight more arriving, and more than 200 toilets. It also said there are toilets stationed every kilometre between parts of the M20. ""We are working tirelessly to provide support to hauliers awaiting testing at Manston and the M20,"" it said. By Simon Jones, BBC reporter at the scene Frustrated lorry drivers have confronted the police as tensions over their continuing confinement threatened to boil over. Some hauliers marched out of the Manston lorry park, where they've been forced to sleep in their cabs, demanding to know when they'll be allowed to go home. There's a huge backlog of traffic to clear. Some hauliers said they'd been told the testing on the site was initially delayed because the tests got held up in traffic. Manston is now full - so there'll be some pressure on the authorities to get as many tests done as quickly as possible to clear space for any new arrivals. This video can not be played Aerial views of the thousands of lorries stuck in Kent since the border shut Eurotunnel said around around 700 cars, 50 vans and 20 trucks s have been able to cross the Channel since this morning, and a ""flow"" of trucks has arrived at the British terminal since 16:00 GMT. Roger Gough, leader of Kent County Council, told BBC Radio Kent that the ""most difficult"" challenge is clearing a route from Manston Airport to Dover, around 20 miles south, ""to be able to get those lorries onto the ferries"". ""Whilst we're able, for instance, to get some progress in terms of people travelling via the Eurotunnel, it's much harder to get vehicles to the port in the current situation,"" he said. ""The problem is also that - particularly for the non-HGV traffic, the families and so on - you have some really quite worrying welfare situations,"" he said. He added that the British authorities are in a ""race against time"" because the last ferry leaves on Christmas eve, and are trying to persuade the French to ""keep things running on the Calais side over Christmas day"". More than 5,000 lorries are being held in Kent, according to the Department for Transport. Officials have been going from lorry to lorry to provide tests. Home Secretary Priti Patel urged hauliers ""not to travel to Kent as we work to alleviate congestion"" as ""travelling now will slow things down"". ""Tourist travellers who are not French residents should not travel,"" she tweeted. The Port of Dover alsourged passengers not to turn up,externalwithout a negative coronavirus test. NHS Test and Trace staff have been going from vehicle to vehicle with tests at Dover. Mr Jenrick told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it is likely to take ""a few days"" to clear the backlog of lorries that have built up. He said there would be ""multiple testing sites"" at Manston Airport and elsewhere. Rapid ""lateral flow"" tests will be used, which can detect the new variant and work like a pregnancy test to give a result in about 30 minutes. Freight drivers will receive their test result by text, and a negative result gives them the right to cross the Channel. If they test positive they will be offered Covid-secure hotel accommodation nearby where they will have to self isolate. Testing will also take place on the French side for hauliers entering the UK.

The Road Haulage Association said: ""Even if the border is opened up, a short delay in the process is going to mean huge delays in the supply chain."" Normally, about 10,000 lorries a day travel between Dover and Calais at Christmas, largely bringing in the freshest produce. More than 50 other countries, including Germany, Italy, India and Pakistan, are continuing to block travellers from the UK. The Netherlands and Belgium have also now lifted their ban, but will only accept people if they have a recent negative result. The Netherlands has demanded UK arrivals use so-called PCR tests, which can take over 24 hours to turn around as they require a lab.

"This video can not be played ""I am kicking myself very hard"" - Nicola Sturgeon apologises for mask rule breach Scotland's first minister has apologised for breaching Covid rules by taking her face mask off at a wake. TheScottish Sun has published a photograph,externalof Nicola Sturgeon standing talking to three people at a social distance, but with her face uncovered. She was attending a wake after the funeral of a Scottish government civil servant who died with Covid. Ms Sturgeon had been wearing a tartan mask and is said to have taken it off briefly as she was leaving the venue. The Scottish government's Covid regulations say that customers in hospitality venues must wear a face covering except when seated - including when they are entering, exiting and moving around. Anyone who breaches the face covering rules can be punished by a fixed penalty notice of Â£60. However Police Scotland said they would not be taking any action, saying the first minister had apologised and ""acknowledged this inadvertent breach"" of the regulations. What are the latest Covid rules in Scotland? Scottish level four rules 'may be strengthened' In a statement, Ms Sturgeon said she had ""briefly"" removed her face mask while attending a wake, calling it a ""stupid mistake"". Addressing MSPs at Holyrood, the first minister said she wanted to express ""how sorry I am for my breach of rules that I ask all of us to follow"". Ms Sturgeon said: ""I want to be clear that regardless of the circumstances, I was in the wrong. There are no excuses. ""These rules do apply to me, just as they do to everyone else, and the rules really matter. ""I am kicking myself very hard - possibly harder than my worst critic ever could - but more importantly I'll be making sure I don't drop my guard again."" Ms Sturgeon is understood to have been at the wake in the Stable Bar and Restaurant in Edinburgh after attending a service at nearby Mortonhall Crematorium. The first minister regularly uses her daily coronavirus briefings to remind people to cover their faces to limit the risk of spreading the virus. Scotland's national clinical director Jason Leitch toldGood Morning Scotlandhe had spoken to Ms Sturgeon last night and she was ""furious with herself"". ""She is absolutely mad at this little lapse in concentration - it's so easily done,"" he said. ""We live in a completely different world from a year ago. ""She was leaving a funeral of a colleague of ours - a wonderful, wonderful individual who did a huge amount of work during the pandemic. It was an awfully sad day for many of us in the government who knew him and his family well. ""It just reinforces again to all of us, the nature of these instructions and this virus."" When you make and promote coronavirus rules, it is not a good idea to break them. No-one understands that better than Nicola Sturgeon, who has already parted company with an MP and a medical adviser for past breaches. The first minister has not taken a train journey having tested positive for the virus as MP Margaret Ferrier did. She had not made unnecessary trips to a holiday home during lockdown as her former chief medical officer, Catherine Calderwood, did. Nor has she taken a drive to Barnard Castle as the prime minister's former adviser Dominic Cummings did. Nicola Sturgeon's breach - removing her face mask briefly to talk to people at a funeral wake - is relatively minor. But it is a breach. That's why the first minister has put her hands up and apologised for what she calls a ""stupid mistake"". It is a mistake that anyone could make but when you're fronting the campaign to get the public to obey coronavirus rules, it does not make that job any easier. A Scottish Conservative spokesman said: ""The first minister should know better. By forgetting the rules and failing to set a proper example, she's undermining essential public health messaging. ""It's a blunder that an ordinary member of the public wouldn't get away with. There cannot be one rule for Nicola Sturgeon and another for everyone else."" Scotland's Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf said in a tweet that Ms Sturgeon had been ""upfront"" from the very beginning of the pandemic. ""She has apologised for [the] accidental lapse (which I suspect most of us have had one over last 9 months),""he wrote,external. He said the FM was her own harshest critic and that ""most people"" would accept her apology and move on. Jillian Evans, head of health intelligence at NHS Grampian, said high-profile breaches of Covid rules ""matter a lot"" to the public. She told the BBC'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme: ""There are clear breaches and then there are indiscretions. ""I'm not passing comment on anyone in particular, but some of us are prone to lapses now and again. ""The main thing is how honest and trustworthy our leaders are. I don't doubt anyone in Scotland's dedication to the cause but it really does matter, because everybody must follow the rules at all times as much as they possibly can.""

"The EU and UK appear close to striking a post-Brexit trade deal, with Boris Johnson briefing his cabinet on the progress of talks in Brussels. Disputes over fishing rights and future business competition rules have been the major hurdles to agreement during months of often fraught talks. But BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said Downing Street now seemed ""very confident"" of a deal. Negotiators are now thought to be thrashing out the final details. The official announcement of a deal is expected on Thursday morning. The document is thought to be around 2,000 pages long, with both sides having until 31 December - when the UK leaves EU trading rules - get it approved by parliamentarians. Brexit: If the boat comes in How do voters feel about Brexit now? Brexit: Can the talks be extended? Why is fishing important in Brexit trade talks? A deal would end the prospect of the two sides imposing widespread import taxes - tariffs - on each other's goods from 1 January, which could have affected prices. EU sources said the UK prime minister and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen had been in contact in an attempt to break the deadlock before the expected pause in negotiations for Christmas. Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are happening:The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. What happens next with Brexit? The UK has insisted on having control over fishing in its waters from 1 January and retaining a larger share of the catch from them than under the current quota system. But the EU wanted to phase in a new fishing system over a longer period and retain more of its access to UK waters for boats from France, Spain and other member states. The sides also disagreed over whether UK firms should continue to follow the same rules as companies within the EU - and on how future trading disputes should be resolved. UK ministers have repeatedly ruled outany extension to the transition period, under which the UK has continued to follow Brussels's trade rules since it left the EU on 31 January. The European Research Group of Brexit-supporting Conservative MPs has promised to reconvene its ""star chamber"" of lawyers - which was highly critical of previous Prime Minister Theresa May's withdrawal agreement with the EU - to analyse any deal that is reached. Chairman Mark Francois and deputy chairman David Jones said it would ""scrutinise it in detail, to ensure that its provisions genuinely protect the sovereignty of the United Kingdom"".

Pollock trained as a translator, once joking that she ""could have been a Eurocrat with a Porsche in every European capital city"". But her first love was theatre. After moving to London, she worked backstage at the Bush Theatre, getting her break when an actress announced she would not be able to go on the following night. Pollock was sent home with the script to learn the part. ""It was really scary - but I did it,"" she said. When she auditioned for Bread, the producers wanted the character to be from Liverpool - but Pollock convinced them she should be Irish. ""The reason I said that was because I had been trying out my Liverpool accent on the taxi driver on the way to the audition and he asked me which part of Australia I came from. I thought then that I'd be better off sticking to what I knew."" She got the part, and Bread ran from 1986-91, attracting 21 million viewers at its peak in 1988. Pollock (left) with Jean Boht (right) in Bread She said she didn't mind being associated with the character. ""I disbelieve actors who say 'I want rid of that image',""she told the Northern Echo in 2004,external. ""People will always remember me as Lilo Lil and it's wonderful. I like it when someone says in a supermarket, 'You know who you remind me of, don't take offence, that tart from Bread'."" When she got her first Hollywood role, it was as brothel keeper Molly Kay in 1992's Far and Away. ""It amused Jean Boht [Nellie Boswell] from Bread,"" the actress recalled.

"Hotel and restaurant group Whitbread has asked landlords for a 50% rent cut for the next three months as pandemic restrictions continue to hit trading. The owner of the Premier Inn, Beefeater and Brewers Fayre brands said in a letter to landlords they must ""share some of the pain"" of lockdown. Britain's biggest hospitality group, with 800 hotels in the UK and Ireland, had already warned of big job cuts. Landlords and commercial property investors will likely resist rent cuts. They have seen their own finances depleted by rent cuts and restructurings across the hospitality sector. Unlike many rivals, Whitbread had continued to pay rent in full. Andrew Jones, chief executive of LondonMetric, a FTSE 250 property company with a Premier Inn tenant, said Whitbread has ""behaved impeccably"" towards to landlords ""and so we will look to help them with their cash flow whilst the business recovers"". But he added: ""A permanent transfer of value from our shareholders to theirs is not appropriate for a company still valued at over Â£6bn. ""There are no contractual provisions for landlords to share gains in the good years and so sharing pain in the tough years seems inequitable. After all, you can't un-sign a contract."" Deferring rent payments for a period would be more ""equitable"", he said. Whitbread also owns the Beefeater chain of restaurants Laura Lambie, senior investment director for Investec, told the BBC's Today Programme that the letter,first reported by property news publication CoStar,external, was âworrying from the landlordâs point of view, not just Whitbreadâ. A Whitbread spokesperson said that since the start of the pandemic the business ""has taken decisive action to ensure that our cost base reflects the low levels of demand"". The company added: ""Throughout the pandemic to date, we have paid our rent commitments in full, even when our hotels and restaurants were forced to close. ""With ongoing government restrictions expected to result in subdued market demand into the first half of 2021, we are now asking our landlords to support us, as other stakeholders have during the pandemic, through a reduction in rent for the December quarter in recognition of the current environment."" In September, Whitbread warned that 6,000 of its workers could be laid off. The company also scrapped its dividends to shareholders, while directors and senior management took pay cuts. More than 27,000 staff were furloughed under the Job Retention Scheme. The company recently invested $40m (Â£30m) in new German hotels which it planned to open by December, despite reporting a Â£725m loss for the six months to the end of August. The UK government has extended eviction protection for retailers and restaurants until the end of 2020, and has also renewed a business rate holiday for the current financial year.

"This video can not be played Trump asks Congress to amend Covid aid bill US President Trump has urged Congress to amend a $900bn (Â£670bn) coronavirus relief bill to more than triple its stimulus payments to Americans. In a video message posted on Twitter, he said the package ""really is a disgrace"", full of ""wasteful"" items. ""It's called the Covid relief bill, but it has almost nothing to do with Covid,"" he said. The $900bn bill includes one-off $600 payments to most Americans, but Mr Trump said the figure should be $2,000. His statement stunned Capitol Hill. Republicans and Democrats have been negotiating a coronavirus stimulus rescue package since July and Mr Trump - who has largely stayed out of the talks - had been expected to sign the legislation into law following its passage through Congress on Monday night. Hunger spikes, demand rises for US food banks Unemployed in the US: 'I donât know what to do' Counting down the days to losing a home The package of measures is linked to a bigger government spending bill, which includes foreign aid funding as well as a $1.4tn spending measure to fund federal agencies for the next nine months. Those agencies will have to shut if the president vetoes or refuses to sign it by midnight next Monday. Most legislation that comes from Congress requires the approval of the president before becoming law. If the president rejects this bill, it would require at least a two-thirds majority in each chamber - the House of Representatives and the Senate - to override the veto. However, Mr Trump has not specifically said he would veto the bill. WhileCongress has overridden fewer than 10% of all presidential vetoes,external, US media say there could be enough votes from both Democrats and Republicans in Congress to do so in this instance. In Tuesday night's message from the White House, Mr Trump baulked at spending in the bill on other countries, arguing that this money should go to struggling Americans. He said: ""This bill contains $85.5m for assistance to Cambodia, $134m to Burma, $1.3bn for Egypt and the Egyptian military, which will go out and buy almost exclusively Russian military equipment, $25m for democracy and gender programmes in Pakistan, $505m to Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama."" The president questioned why the Kennedy Center, a performing arts complex in Washington DC, was set to receive $40m when it is not open, and more than $1bn has been allocated to museums and galleries in the capital. Mr Trump concluded: ""Congress found plenty of money for foreign countries, lobbyists and special interests, while sending the bare minimum to the American people who need it. It wasn't their fault. It was China's fault. ""I am asking Congress to amend this bill and increase the ridiculously low $600 to $2,000 or $4,000 for a couple. This video can not be played ""I'm not sure how we're going to survive"" ""I'm also asking Congress to immediately get rid of the wasteful and unnecessary items from this legislation and to send me a suitable bill, or else the next administration will have to deliver a Covid relief package."" On Monday afternoon, congressional leaders unveiled a 5,593-page package and voted on it several hours later. Several lawmakers protested that they had not been given an opportunity to read the contents. Nevertheless the bill sailed through the House of Representatives by 359-53 and the Senate by 92-6. This video can not be played 'We used to donate to this food bank, now we rely on it' The relief package contains a number of provisions that will help tens of millions of Americans struggling to make ends meet in the pandemic-battered economy. The one-off payments of $600 are half the sum provided by the last major coronavirus aid bill in March, which contained $2.4tn in economic relief. Monday's package extends federal jobless benefits of up to $300 per week for 11 weeks, although this again is half the amount provided by the previous bill. The package contains $25bn in rental aid and extends an eviction moratorium that was due to expire at the end of this month, a lifeline for millions of Americans. The bill also bans surprise medical billing - where hospital patients get slapped with often exorbitant stealth fees because they were treated by a doctor who was not covered by their health insurer. But after poring over the mammoth legislation, journalists and critics have highlighted a string of alleged giveaways for lobbyists. The Washington Post, for example, reports that the package contains $110bn in tax breaks for sectors such as the liquor industry and motorsports entertainment. On Tuesday, President-elect Joseph Biden said the coronavirus bill was merely a ""down payment"" and vowed he would press lawmakers to pass another stimulus bill after he enters office next month. ""Congress did its job this week,"" the Democrat said, speaking from his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, ""and I can and I must ask them to do it again next year."" This video can not be played Joe Biden: 'Darkest days' ahead in the battle against Covid The most powerful congressional Democrat, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, usually a fierce antagonist of the president, said she agreed with Mr Trump's call for $2,000 one-off stimulus payments for every American. ""Let's do it!"" she tweeted, pledging that her party would bring the proposal to the floor this week. Such a plan would need to be passed by the Republican-controlled Senate, where it may well face resistance. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, a staunch ally of President Trump, responded to Ms Pelosi with his own tweets welcoming her support for increasing payments, and saying ""let's go further"" and ""agree with President Trump that Big Tech needs to be reined in by winding down Section 230 liability protections"". The Democratic minority leader of the Senate, Chuck Schumer, tweeted: ""Trump needs to sign the bill to help people and keep the government open and we're glad to pass more aid Americans need"".

"Kernowite has a distinctive dark green colour An ""amazing"" new type of mineral has been discovered by scientists analysing a rock mined in Cornwall about 220 years ago. The dark green mineral has been named kernowite after Kernow, the Cornish language word for Cornwall. A group led by Natural History Museum (NHM) mineralogist Mike Rumsey made the discovery while studying a rock taken from Wheal Gorland mine in St Day. Mr Rumsey said: ""It's amazing that in 2020 we are adding a new mineral."" For centuries, mineralogists believed the green crystals to be a variation of another mineral, liroconite, but Mr Rumsey and his team found it has a different chemical composition. Blue liroconite is highly prized by collectors around the world, and the majority of it comes from the Wheal Gorland site. The mineral was discovered within a rock specimen that has been at the Natural History Museum in London since 1964 Cornwall has a rich mining history with Unescoworld heritage status,externaland is known globally for the discovery of minerals. Mr Rumsey, principal curator of minerals at the NHM in London, said: ""A lot of these discoveries happened over 100 years ago when the mines were still active, so the discovery of a new mineral from Cornwall, particularly one that is related to the region's most famous mineral, is really quite amazing. ""Considering how many geologists, prospectors and collectors have scoured the county over the centuries in search of mineral treasure, it's amazing that in 2020 we are adding a new mineral."" Mike Rumsey is principal curator of minerals at the Natural History Museum, which has one of the most important collections in the world A new mineral is discovered in the UK every three or four years on average, according to the NHM The new description has now been approved by theInternational Mineralogical Association,externaland the new type will be published inMineralogical Magazine,externalnext year. Mr Rumsey said most liroconite comes from Wheal Gorland, adding: ""The mine was used between around 1790 and 1909, but it has been demolished now. ""There is a housing estate on it and there is nothing left. It's an extinct locality, we can never go back."" The mine where it was discovered has now been built over ""What we've got is a bit like a little time capsule,"" Mr Rumsey said. ""The fact that this sample was preserved in a museum means that we can do this kind of research because we'd never be able to go back and collect any more."" The structure of the crystals is the same as liroconite, but kernowite contains iron instead of aluminium, creating the different colour A mineral is naturally occurring chemical substance formed by geological processes A rock is an object formed of one, or many minerals in combination Many minerals form beautiful crystals, the most prized being those with bright colours, glass-like transparency and attractive crystal forms The gemstone minerals and their varieties, like diamonds, emeralds and rubies have been desirable since ancient times The Natural History Museum's mineral collection isone of the most important and comprehensive collections of its type in the world,external, containing about 185,000 specimens Cornwall lithium deposits 'globally significant' Israeli company unearths rare mineral Tourists pinch crystals at Iceland mine Natural History Museum Hallworthy Market Report: Thursday, January 9 Cornwall weather and traffic updates as another Met Office ice warning starts More Cornwall patients waited over an hour in ambulances last week than anywhere else in country Chef who turned life around after fire led to serious diagnosis makes appeal Award-winning Helston estate agent expands with second office in Cornwall Prominent councillor denies Cornwall Council car parks are being sold off At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"Actress Eileen Pollock, best known for playing Lilo Lil in 1980s TV sitcom Bread, has died at the age of 73. Pollock, from Belfast, played Freddie Boswell's brassy mistress in the hit comedy about a large Liverpool family. She also had a long stage career and appeared in such films as Far and Away, starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, and Mike Leigh's Four Days in July. Her agents said she was ""truly a powerhouse of an actor, with huge generosity and spirit"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Pollock trained as a translator, once joking that she ""could have been a Eurocrat with a Porsche in every European capital city"". But her first love was theatre. After moving to London, she worked backstage at the Bush Theatre, getting her break when an actress announced she would not be able to go on the following night. Pollock was sent home with the script to learn the part. ""It was really scary - but I did it,"" she said. When she auditioned for Bread, the producers wanted the character to be from Liverpool - but Pollock convinced them she should be Irish. ""The reason I said that was because I had been trying out my Liverpool accent on the taxi driver on the way to the audition and he asked me which part of Australia I came from. I thought then that I'd be better off sticking to what I knew."" She got the part, and Bread ran from 1986-91, attracting 21 million viewers at its peak in 1988. Pollock (left) with Jean Boht (right) in Bread She said she didn't mind being associated with the character. ""I disbelieve actors who say 'I want rid of that image',""she told the Northern Echo in 2004,external. ""People will always remember me as Lilo Lil and it's wonderful. I like it when someone says in a supermarket, 'You know who you remind me of, don't take offence, that tart from Bread'."" When she got her first Hollywood role, it was as brothel keeper Molly Kay in 1992's Far and Away. ""It amused Jean Boht [Nellie Boswell] from Bread,"" the actress recalled. ""She said I had been promoted from a tart in the TV series."" Her other film credits included 1999's Angela's Ashes, and she played the title role in BBC Radio 4 comedy The Pamela Myers Show in 1995.

"Marston's is to take over the running of Brains pubs in a bid to save 1,300 jobs in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. The pub operator will take over the running of all 156 of the brewer's pubs, mainly in Wales. Brains said restrictions during the pandemic had put the business under ""significant financial pressure"". Chief executive Alistair Darby said the long-term agreement safeguarded 1,300 pub jobs. Under the agreement, Marston's will pay rent for the entire estate but keep the Brains name while running the pubs as a tenant. All pubs in Wales have been forced to close as the country battles the pandemic Brains closed more than 100 of its pubs after theWelsh Government announced an alcohol ban in pubs and restaurants at the start of Decemberin a bid curb the spread of the virus. On Saturday all pubs were forced to close their doors in the final days before Christmas as Wales entered a level four national lockdown. Last month the 138-year-old firm suggested the previous firebreak lockdown had cost it Â£1.6m. Fear pubs will 'go bust' unless rules relaxed Cardiff brewer Brains gets rid of 36,000 pints of beer The deal, which is expected to close in February, will add to Marston's 1,368 pubs in the UK, including 106 in Wales. Back in March, Brains announced plans tosell 40 of its pubs with workers warned of potential job losses due to economic uncertainty caused by Brexit. Ralph Findlay, Chief Executive of Marston's, said the pubs were a ""great fit"" within the operator's existing estate. ""We look forward to the pub teams joining us and to welcoming guests and the communities which they serve, back into these pubs as the country emerges from the pandemic over the weeks and months ahead,"" he said. The Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA) said the deal brought hope the pubs would survive, but added it would be disappointed if it marked steps towards closing the Cardiff brewery. ""It will be interesting to see what the details of this deal are, how the Marston's beer will sit alongside the Brains beer, and what the future is for the brewery itself,"" said CEO of CAMRA Tom Stainer. He added: ""This is good news, as we were worried that these pubs would be closed permanently, or sold for property development or non-pub use."" There is currently no suggestion the brewery is affected by the plans.

"Residents of care homes have been given a higher priority than other older people Older people in Wales should be told when to expect a Covid vaccination, a commissioner representing them says. Helena Herklots says more clarity on the plan for over-80s in Wales would be ""helpful"" in light of different approaches elsewhere in the UK. Former MP Ann Clwyd said many feared they were missing out as jabs were being given out in parts of England. The Welsh Government says health boards are beginning to invite some people over the age of 80 for vaccination. The priority list puts vulnerable people into nine groups. Priority one is care home residents and staff, with priority two being people over 80 along with front-line health and care workers. Defending the Welsh Government's handling of the vaccine rollout, Health Minister Vaughan Gething said onsocial media,externalthe vaccine programme is ""not stuttering in Wales"" and was ahead of England per-head of population. Mr Gething said: ""I appreciate some people will be concerned but I can say categorically that people in Wales are not being left behind."" Helena Herklots said there was ""potential confusion"" because of reports of vaccination rollouts elsewhere Ms Herklots said older people wanted the vaccine as soon as possible and ""a great deal of work"" was going into to rolling out the vaccine ""quickly and effectively"". ""Given reports in the past few days about the different approaches being taking to deliver the vaccine in different parts of the UK, and the potential confusion this could cause, it would be helpful for the Welsh Government to provide further information to older people about its plans, clearly setting out what the arrangements will be and when they can expect to be vaccinated,"" the commissioner said. Ms Clwyd, 83, who was Labour MP for Cynon Valley for 35 years, has also called for clarity. ""People are very afraid and they want assurances. They want to know what is happening,"" she told BBC Wales. Ann Clwyd: ""They think everybody's getting the vaccine apart from them"" ""I know people around me who are more elderly than I am, and ill, and they've had no notification at all. ""They're hearing what's happening in England and they think everybody's getting the vaccine apart from them."" A Welsh Government spokesperson said: ""The safety and protection of the most vulnerable people is at the heart of our response to the pandemic. ""Health boards are starting to invite some people over 80 for vaccination now. We are hoping the second vaccine - the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine - will be approved by the UK regulator as this will help us accelerate our vaccination programme and provide more clinics in primary care settings, like GP practices."" Across Wales more than 25,000 people have received the first of two doses of the vaccine. Currently only one vaccine, BioNTech/Pfizer, has been approved for use in the UK. We can now see for the first time the breakdown of the numbers of people in Wales on the priority list for vaccines. They include more than 40,000 people living or working in care homes, thousands of front-line NHS and social care staff and the 174,000 people aged over 80. Included are 84,000 adults classed as ""extremely vulnerable"". More than 1.4 million people in all belong to one of the nine priority groups - including the overlap of about 192,000 people who may belong to more than one group. This leaves another one million or so people under 50, without a risk condition, who will be in line eventually to receive a vaccine. Welsh Conservative health spokesman Andrew RT Davies called on the Welsh Government to ""get a grip"". ""The vaccination programme is stuttering into life in Wales with some real concerns around lack of access for care homes and the over 80s compared to other parts of the UK,"" he said. ""To keep confidence Welsh Labour ministers need to get a grip. Otherwise, there is a risk, given the scale of the vaccination programme, the public will lose confidence in the Welsh Government's ability to deliver it, replicating their shambolic handling of the virus to date."" Plaid Cymru Member of the Senedd Dai Lloyd also criticised ""a dearth of information about vaccine rollout for the over-80s, which only adds to the anxiety people are facing over this Christmas"". Dr Lloyd, who is a GP, added: ""Reports suggest that other UK nations are well ahead of us in Wales, which is an unacceptable situation. ""To reflect Wales's older population, Plaid Cymru had called for vaccines to be allocated according to need, not simply allocated by population. The UK and Welsh Government must urgently reassess whether Wales is getting its fair share.""

"President Emmanuel Macron said the nation shared the grief of the families of the police officers A gunman has shot dead three police officers who were called to a domestic violence incident in central France. The suspect, 48, said to be known to authorities on child custody issues, was later found dead, officials said. A woman had fled to the roof of a house in a remote village near Saint-Just in the early hours of Wednesday. The gunman killed one officer and wounded another. He then set fire to the house and killed two more officers who arrived. The woman was rescued. President Emmanuel Macron said the nation shared the grief of the families of the police officers. Elite tactical police officers were at the scene on Wednesday in the village in the Puy-de-DÃ´me department, in France's Massif Central mountain region. As the sequence of events became clear, prosecutor Eric Maillaud described the scene as a ""real war zone"" as he described a man who had been in conflict with his wife and had an arsenal of weapons. ""What's certain is that he was totally battle-hardened in handling weapons,"" he told reporters. The mayor of Saint-Just, FranÃ§ois Chautard, said initially that the house had burned down but it took police time to confirm that the suspect was dead, and the prosecutor said an initial examination of his body suggested he had taken his own life. Police told French media that he had been found dead in his car nearby. He was named locally as FrÃ©dÃ©ric Limol and described as a shooting enthusiast with a disturbing profile. Interior Minister GÃ©rald Darmanin visited the scene and named the first officer who died as Brig Arno Mavel, 21, and the two who died in the second incident as Lt Cyrille Morel, 45, and Adjutant RÃ©mi Dupuis, 37. The incident began late on Tuesday when the suspect's new partner raised the alarm with a friend shortly before 21:00 (20:00 GMT). She was bleeding and had fled to the roof of the building. Soon afterwards a gendarme patrol arrived, realised the man was dangerous and called for help. The first shots were fired at around 22:30. The youngest of the three gendarmes was killed but a colleague was saved by his bulletproof vest. The man then set fire to his home and shot dead the two other gendarmes. It later emerged he was wearing a bulletproof vest and had a gun equipped for night-vision. The gunman's partner was led to safety. The man eventually fled in his car but crashed into a tree and was found with a Glock pistol in his hand. Mr Darmanin expressed his profound sadness at the gendarmes' deaths and extended his condolences,externalto their family, friends and colleagues. He said the deaths showed once more the risks that police officers were exposed to in their daily duties. In his tweet, Mr Macron said the security forces put their lives at risk to protect the public and were ""our heroes"": Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Home for Christmas: travellers arriving at Belfast International Airport Health Minister Robin Swann says the Stormont executive's stay-at-home lockdown message will be made ""legally enforceable"". It comes after a request he made to the executive to ensure people abide by new rules taking effect on Saturday. It will mean people outside of their homes between 20:00 and 06:00 until 2 January, without a reasonable excuse, could be asked to return home. Mr Swann said the PSNI would be given ""additional"" enforcement powers. Initially the executive agreed the stay at home message would remain guidance rather than law. However Mr Swann said on Tuesday ministers supported his proposal to toughen this up. He told BBC Newsline: ""The regulations published tonight will see that go into regulation, the executive agreed to that yesterday and it is being worked through by the departmental solicitors' office to ensure it is legally enforceable. ""From 8pm to 6am that week, the police will have additional powers to enforce things."" Meanwhile, anyone travelling into Northern Ireland who plans to stay for at least 24 hours will have to self-isolate on arrival, according to the restrictions. The measures are containedin a newly published paper from the executive,external. However, the paper says that people who routinely cross the border for essential purposes will not be subject to restrictions. In Northern Ireland a further 21 coronavirus-related deaths were reported on Wednesday. The Department of Health's death toll is now 1,240. There were also a further 787 cases of Covid-19 diagnosed. Travellers entering Northern Ireland for 24 hours must self-isolate for 10 days The First Minister Arlene Foster has used her Christmas message to urge people to make ""common cause"" against the ""enemy of Covid"" but said there was also cause for hope. ""The United Kingdom has led the way in approving and providing the first vaccine,"" she said. ""Right now Northern Ireland has the highest vaccination rate in the UK and the world. ""More vaccines will follow, reinforcements in our fight against COVID."" The paper due to be published by the executive details the week-long ""stay-at-home curfew"" coming into force in NI on Boxing Day as well as new guidance around travel. The new guidance lists what qualifies as essential travel during that period of time including for work and health reasons. The guidance states that people should only travel within Northern Ireland when it is absolutely necessary. It says that essential travel includes: Returning home, if you are away from your permanent residence Work, when you cannot work from home Accessing health and social care services Accessing critical services Fulfilling essential caring responsibilities Buying essential goods or services in your local area Exercising an animal or going to the vet Fulfilling a legal obligation Providing emergency response services. On Sunday, theexecutive agreed so-called Christmas bubblesshould be limited to one day. The move followed action in England, Scotland and Wales on Saturday, cutting the previously agreed five days to just one. Earlier, the executive decided a new six-week lockdown must be introduced from 00.01 GMT on 26 December, which will be reviewed after four weeks. Northern Ireland's politicians are not in agreement on how to best handle the current level of risk. Sinn FÃ©in called for an all-Ireland-Great Britain travel ban and, in a late-night vote on Monday, the SDLP supported this. However, Alliance, the DUP and UUP voted against. How Northern Ireland's new restrictions affect you NI Covid-19 restrictions: Your questions answered Some 40 countries, including the Republic, havebanned UK arrivals due to concerns about the new variant. In the Republic of Ireland, anyone travelling from Britain must self-isolate for 14 days. That means staying in their room - regardless of negative test results - from the date of their arrival. There will be an increased Garda presence on Irish roads but road blocks will not be placed on the border to prevent travel between Northern Ireland and the Republic. Northern Ireland's new restrictions will come on the same day that the Department of Health advised people who are classed as clinically extremely vulnerable (CEV) to no longer attend work if they cannot work from home. It added that ""people are free to make their own judgements... depending on the Covid-security of their working environment"". Dr Michael McBride stressed this was not a return to shielding Chief medical officer Dr Michael McBride said: ""This strengthened advice is intended to offer enhanced protection from Covid-19 to the most vulnerable people in our society. ""It is not a return to shielding as we knew it at the outset of the pandemic. ""We are not advising CEV people to stay permanently indoors, and I would encourage CEV people to continue to go outside for exercise, provided they observe social distancing when they do so."" The health minister has highlighted the updated guidance for visiting people in care homes over Christmas. Covid-19 testing is available to one visitor per care home resident per week over the Christmas period and up to Friday 8 January 2021. More details are available on theDepartment of Health website,external.

"President Emmanuel Macron said the nation shared the grief of the families of the police officers A gunman has shot dead three police officers who were called to a domestic violence incident in central France. The suspect, 48, said to be known to authorities on child custody issues, was later found dead, officials said. A woman had fled to the roof of a house in a remote village near Saint-Just in the early hours of Wednesday. The gunman killed one officer and wounded another. He then set fire to the house and killed two more officers who arrived. The woman was rescued. President Emmanuel Macron said the nation shared the grief of the families of the police officers. Elite tactical police officers were at the scene on Wednesday in the village in the Puy-de-DÃ´me department, in France's Massif Central mountain region. As the sequence of events became clear, prosecutor Eric Maillaud described the scene as a ""real war zone"" as he described a man who had been in conflict with his wife and had an arsenal of weapons. ""What's certain is that he was totally battle-hardened in handling weapons,"" he told reporters. The mayor of Saint-Just, FranÃ§ois Chautard, said initially that the house had burned down but it took police time to confirm that the suspect was dead, and the prosecutor said an initial examination of his body suggested he had taken his own life. Police told French media that he had been found dead in his car nearby. He was named locally as FrÃ©dÃ©ric Limol and described as a shooting enthusiast with a disturbing profile. Interior Minister GÃ©rald Darmanin visited the scene and named the first officer who died as Brig Arno Mavel, 21, and the two who died in the second incident as Lt Cyrille Morel, 45, and Adjutant RÃ©mi Dupuis, 37. The incident began late on Tuesday when the suspect's new partner raised the alarm with a friend shortly before 21:00 (20:00 GMT). She was bleeding and had fled to the roof of the building. Soon afterwards a gendarme patrol arrived, realised the man was dangerous and called for help. The first shots were fired at around 22:30. The youngest of the three gendarmes was killed but a colleague was saved by his bulletproof vest. The man then set fire to his home and shot dead the two other gendarmes. It later emerged he was wearing a bulletproof vest and had a gun equipped for night-vision. The gunman's partner was led to safety. The man eventually fled in his car but crashed into a tree and was found with a Glock pistol in his hand. Mr Darmanin expressed his profound sadness at the gendarmes' deaths and extended his condolences,externalto their family, friends and colleagues. He said the deaths showed once more the risks that police officers were exposed to in their daily duties. In his tweet, Mr Macron said the security forces put their lives at risk to protect the public and were ""our heroes"": Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"How did Grenfell Tower come to be covered in combustible materials when it was refurbished? That's the question the public inquiry into the west London fire in June 2017 which killed 72 people has been asking. This year the inquiry has heard more than 400 hours of evidence, from 53 witnesses. The team behind the BBC's Grenfell Tower Inquiry podcast has reported on all of it. Here's what we've learned. Two types of combustible plastic foam insulation were used on the outside of Grenfell Tower. Staff from Celotex, which made the majority of the insulation, say they behaved unethically, dishonestly and the company lied for commercial gainwhile getting their product approved for use on high-rise buildings. Combustible insulation could be used in these situations only if it passed a large-scale fire test. The inquiry was told Celotex added a non-combustible material to its test, to ensure flames would not reach the company's insulation. It hid the material's use from the fire test report, official certification bodies and even the company's sales staff. The second company involved was the market leader, Kingspan. For 14 years Kingspan's insulation was sold for use on high-rise buildings without a relevant large-scale fire test. Its insulation passed a test in 2005 but Kingspan changed the product a year later. Subsequent tests turned into a ""raging inferno"". Kingspan continued to sell its insulation using the 2005 test on the old material. This test was only withdrawn in October 2020 after the company accepted it did not represent the product on sale. When one company questioned Kingspan's approach to sales,technical manager Philip Heath wrote to friends to say they had confused him ""with someone who gives a damn"". Philip Heath apologised for the email and said he was ""in a dark place"" at the time he sent it because one of the friends he was messaging was terminally ill. Some witnesses didn't have a full grasp of the building regulations. The lead architect had never heard the phrase limited combustibility - the standard recommended for insulation on high-rise buildings. Others have told the inquiry they thought regulations were ambiguous. One fire test measured the spread of flame across the surface of a product. Those which performed the best were awarded a classification of Class 0. Kingspan took the surface off their insulation, a piece of foil thinner than a millimetre, and tested that on its own. Then they advertised their whole insulation product as Class 0 - a standard which it did not achieve. They told the inquiry this was permissible under testing criteria for England and Wales. Lead counsel to the inquiry, Richard Millett, suggested that using Kingspan's interpretation of the regulations, a stick of dynamite wrapped in foil could also be advertised as Class 0. Lead counsel to the inquiry Richard Millett hasaccused witnesses of taking part in a ""merry go-round of buck passing"".He said the public ""would be forced to conclude that everyone involved in the refurbishment of Grenfell Tower did what they were supposed to do and nobody made any serious or causative mistakes"". The inquiry heard how 17 companies worked on the refurbishment through a complex web of contracting and subcontracting. In evidence, witnesses said they thought other companies were responsible for fire safety. Specialist cladding contractor Harley sent its drawings to architecture firm Studio E. Harley witnesses told the inquiry they thought the architects were checking that designs met regulations. Studio E said it thought it only had to examine the building's aesthetics and 'functional utility'. Parts of the drawings which breached regulations slipped through these gaps. Construction professionals often relied on meetings with sales staff to decide whether a material was suitable for use. Celotex's marketing department wrote that those most likely to buy its insulation included anyone who wasn't aware there were restrictionson which materials were permitted for use on high-rise buildings. The fire broke out in the kitchen of a fourth floor flat in the 23-storey tower block just before 01:00 Celotex and Kingspan staff admitted their marketing material was misleading. Large-scale fire tests approved entire cladding systems, not individual products. But Kingspan and Celotex marketed their insulation as ""suitable for buildings over 18 metres in height"". Jonathan Roper of Celotex admitted this was deliberate and misleading. Philip Heath of Kingspan said he thought the company's marketing encouraged clients to contact them for more details. The inquiry heard evidence that on at least one occasion when this happened Kingspan then gave inaccurate evidence. Grenfell Tower was run by Kensington and Chelsea's Tenant Management Organisation (TMO). It hired companies for the Grenfell Tower refurbishment. The TMO hired architects Studio E who had never clad a high-rise residential building before. (The firm had designed the school and leisure centre opposite Grenfell.) Under EU rules, expensive public projects were subject to a competitive tender process.  When hiring Studio E, TMO staff admitted that they expected the fees would be under Â£174,000, so they wouldn't have to go through this. Studio E has admitted that had there been a competitive tender process, it would not have won it. While appointing a main contractor the TMO breached EU procurement rules by informing one of the companies, Rydon, it was in pole position to win the work before the results were officially announced. The TMO acknowledges this created a 'risk of challenge' but says it was not illegal. TMO staff held a ""secret"" meeting with Rydon to discuss how to cut Â£800,000 in costs from the budget.This included using cheaper cladding materials. The TMO insists this was subject to the agreement of planners. One of the aims of the refurbishment was to improve the energy efficiency of the tower. A company called Max Fordham gave Grenfell an ""aspirational"" target of making the 1970s concrete block as efficient as a new build project. Max Fordham suggested two insulation materials that could achieve this.But they did not check the building regulation guidance to see if the products could be used. The architects, Studio E, also made no checks to see whether the combustible materials were compliant with building regulations. It described any concerns its staff may have had about the compliance of the insulation as an ""afterthought"". Many witnesses are asked whether, if they had their time again, they would do anything differently.Terry Ashton, who worked for the fire safety consultants Exova, was clear - he would have asked more questions. Exova completed three fire safety strategies for the Grenfell Tower refurbishment. None of them even acknowledged the crucial fact that the refurbishment involved cladding the outside of the building. Seventy-two people died as a result of the fire Mr Ashton said he would have expected the architects to have directly asked him to consider the safety of the cladding products. They did not, so he didn't. Other Exova staff failed to clarify missing information. Exova's fire safety strategy for the existing building used the word ""assumed"" 19 times in a 16-page report. After the fire, when investigators looked at the cladding that had been installed on Grenfell Tower, they found a catalogue of errors related to how it had been installed. Many cavity barriers - intended to stop fire spreading through cladding -  were poorly fitted or installed in the wrong place. Some were attached back to front, stopping them working. The company responsible for installing the cladding,Osborne Berry, admitted there were examples of unacceptable poor workmanship which should have been ripped out and redone. Grenfell Tower had new windows fitted. During the installation Rydon instructed its subcontractors, SD Plastering, to fill gaps around the windows with combustible insulation. They said neither knew it was combustible. On the night of the fire, this was the main route for the flames to spread into the cladding. Kensington and Chelsea's building control department approved the construction of the Grenfell refurbishment. The officer responsible accepted that his efforts fell below the standards of a reasonably competent building control inspector. John Hoban did not notice that cavity barriers had not been designed around the windows to stop flames spreading to the outside wall. He failed to recognise the cladding materials were not suitable for use together on high-rise buildings. Mr Hoban told the inquiry that as a result of local authority cuts, he was juggling up to 130 projects. A clerk of works was hired to inspect the work carried out on the cladding. His company charged more than Â£400 a day, but he said his remit was not to check whether the work met regulations, or matched architects' drawings.Jonathan White said he only checked that work was neat and tidy. The TMO consulted residents about plans for the building. TMO newsletters claimed there was ""no concern from residents about cladding the building"". But that was based on a meeting which just one resident attended. Information about fire retardancy was not given to residents. During the refurbishment, people complained about the standard of work.The project lead for the main contractor Rydon said the company and other contractors were under massive pressure from ""rebel residents"". During evidence he repeatedly called the residents of Grenfell Tower ""vocal"" and ""aggressive"". Complaints were also made about construction staff who knocked on windows asking for cups of tea, scared pets and dropped materials onto a public footpath. In January the inquiry expects to hear evidence from Arconic, which made the cladding panels. The inquiry has already found the product, with a combustible polyethylene core, was the main cause of the spread of the fire. Campaigners delivered a message to the French embassy in London urging witnesses for cladding firm Arconic residing in France to give evidence A lawyer who represents some of the bereaved, survivors and residents has described Arconic (along with the insulation manufacturers Celotex and Kingspan) as ""little more than crooks and killers""who ""knew their material would burn with lethal speed"". The inquiry has heard that in 2009, a senior Arconic employee called polyethylene cores ""dangerous"". In 2015, while cladding was being installed on Grenfell he wrote: ""We really need to stop proposing PE [polyethylene] â¦. We are in the 'know'."" It's unclear whether all the Arconic witnesses will give evidence. Some are arguing that a French law prevents them from disclosing commercial information in foreign judicial proceedings. Lead counsel to the inquiry Richard Millett has urged them to ""do the right thing"". Kate Lamble is the presenter and producer of the BBC's Grenfell Tower Inquiry Podcast. She has followed every day of evidence since the start of the hearings in June 2018. At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"A taste of things to come? France's decision to stop lorry drivers entering from the UK could affect fresh food supplies France's decision to close the border with the UK to stop the spread of a new variant of the coronavirus has highlighted the importance of the Dover-Calais route for food supplies. French residents and nationals with recent negative coronavirus tests will be able to travel from Wednesday, and lorry drivers can do so after a rapid lateral flow test. So just how dependent is the UK on the EU for food? And should British shoppers be worried? About 30% of all the food we eat in the UK comes from the European Union, according to the British Retail Consortium (BRC) industry group. Britain imports nearly half of its fresh vegetables and the majority of its fruit, both mainly from the EU - and that's where the potential problem was. During the summer months, the UK can grow plenty of its own produce like lettuces and soft berries such as raspberries and strawberries, but when the weather turns colder Britain is forced to rely much more on imports from the EU. In January, for example, the UK imports 90% of the lettuces it needs from the EU. But in June, Britain produces 95% of its own salad leaves. Tomatoes follow the same pattern. In January, the UK buys in 85% of tomatoes from the European bloc, but by summer it is growing 60% of what the country needs. By the time winter rolls around, half of all the UK's food is imported, according to the Food and Drink Federation. It says that while there are no concerns about food supplies over Christmas, shoppers may have started to see gaps in fresh fruit and vegetable supplies from next week - had the UK and France not ""swiftly restored"" their links. When it comes to fresh food, the most efficient and cheapest way to get produce to the UK is in refrigerated trucks, using the ""roll-on roll-off"" method of transport. Food is loaded on the truck at a farm in Spain, for example, and is driven to Calais where it directly ""rolls on"" a ferry or the Eurotunnel and ""rolls off"" when it gets to Dover in the UK before heading to its final destination. These trucks are then loaded up with UK goods which are then sent back across the Channel to EU customers. The driver will stay with the truck - which is known as ""accompanied freight"" - and this is why there were some problems in recent days. France was concerned about drivers coming from the UK with the new variant of the coronavirus. Thousands of lorries got stuck in Kent waiting to get back into the EU. In the past, the UK has turned to other means when fresh produce has been under threat. In 2018, a summer heat wave meant the UK was eating more salad than usual but the hotter weather also made it difficult to actually grow lettuces. Thousands of iceberg lettuces were duly shipped in to the UK from Los Angeles. But this is an expensive method of replenishing supplies and it is doubtful businesses will want to pay a premium for shipping at a time when they could be facing tariffs on buying other goods from the EU depending on a Brexit deal. Despite assurances that plenty of food will be available, some shoppers found empty shelves Last year, the UK exported Â£14.2bn worth of food and drink to the EU, out of a total Â£23.6bn worldwide. The Food and Drink Federation says the UK's biggest exports are goods such as whisky, salmon, chocolate, cheese and gin. The UK also exports a huge amount of the meat it produces to the EU. The National Farmers' Union says 82% of UK beef exports go to the bloc. The UK sells 30% of its lamb overseas, most of which goes to the EU. In the EU, Ireland is the UK's biggest customer. It bought Â£4bn worth of food and drink from the UK in 2019 - although that was a 3.8% drop on the previous year. France bought Â£2.3bn worth of produce from Britain last year, a rise of 3.5%, while the Netherlands imported Â£1.7bn of UK goods, up 5.2%. France's decision to close its border to the UK left hundreds of lorry drivers stranded The UK found itself in the eye of a perfect storm: France shut its border to freight from the UK; winter means the UK is more reliant on the EU for fresh food; Britain will stop trading under EU rules on 31 December; some British ports are facing severe delays; the coronavirus has changed shopping habits and it is Christmas so demand is high. However, the UK's major supermarkets say they have plenty of supplies - following the coronavirus panic-buying earlier this year - and are encouraging people to ""shop as normal"". Tesco said: ""We've been building our stockholding of key products ahead of the Christmas peak and are working closely with our hauliers and suppliers to continue the supply of goods into our stores."" However, it did warn supplies of a few fresh items such as lettuce and citrus fruit might have been reduced ""later this week""-had an agreement not been reached. Sainsbury's said it was looking at alternative ways of sourcing products from Europe, a spokesman says: ""If nothing changes, we will start to see gaps over the coming days on lettuce, some salad leaves, cauliflowers, broccoli and citrus fruit, all of which are imported from the Continent at this time of year."" We'll always have cabbage: The UK grows its own greens We could - though there would certainly not be the variety consumers are used to. The National Farmers' Union says the UK imports 45% of its vegetables, the vast majority of which come from the EU. Britain also buys 84% of its fruit from overseas, although it is less dependent on the EU for these goods. However, Spain is the biggest supplier of fruit to the UK, accounting for 19% of imports. There are certain things we can grow here in the UK whatever the weather. For example, the UK produces 70% of cabbage and cauliflower supplies in January, rising to 90% in June. However, that appears to be more weighted towards cabbage at the moment given that Tesco and Sainsbury's have both warned that cauliflowers could be one of the vegetables affected by the disruption. Meanwhile, vegetables like rhubarb will always thrive here given that it likes damp cold soil. But if difficulties continue at the border with France, or a Brexit deal makes some produce more expensive to bring into the UK, then people may find themselves having to eat whatever is seasonal. No doubt, this will please some such as environmentalists as it means food will not have to travel as far, keeping a lid on emissions. However, it may not agree with everyone's palate.

"The hospital was built in nine days, with the help of up to 200 soldiers a day There is mounting pressure on hospitals, with growing numbers being admitted each day. The fastest growth is being seen in London and the South East, where the new coronavirus variant is believed to be behind a rise in cases. Normally the UK would expect to see about 1,000 new respiratory-related admissions a day in total at this time of year. It is already close to double that for Covid alone. University College London clinical research director Prof Christina Pagel says the situation is ""alarming"". She predicts that by the end of next week, the NHS could exceed the total numbers seen in hospital in the peak in the spring, putting immense strain on the NHS at the busiest time of year. The growing pressure has prompted many to start wondering why the Nightingales have not been opened. Tory MP John Redwood has been vocal on Twitter calling for them to be put to use. These, after all, were the network of emergency field hospitals built during the spring to cope when hospitals could not - most were not used. There are seven in England. Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales established their own field hospitals but these were not known as Nightingales. Wales has now decomissioned its 2,000-bed field hospital, which was at the Principality Stadium, although it has anetwork of smaller sites are now available, some of which are linked to existing hospitals. A number of these are treating Covid patients. But of the original sites only two - one in Exeter and one in Belfast - are currently taking Covid patients. Manchester's is being used for non-Covid patients who are in the final stages of recovery, while the centres in Harrogate and Glasgow are carrying out diagnostic tests and outpatient appointments. Harrogate's Nightingale is being used for diagnostic testing Why, if the NHS is under so much pressure, are others not open? The simple answer, says British Medical Association leader Dr Chaand Nagpaul, is staffing. ""We have 80,000 vacancies. You just can't have a doctor or nurse in two sites at once."" It is a sentiment that is echoed on the ground. Rupert Pearse, an intensive care doctor in east London, said the situation in the capital as well as in north Kent and south Wales ""remains very difficult"". But he says the Nightingales will not help because of the lack of trained staff. ""We are already 'diluting' our skilled ICU nursing staff with less-well-trained volunteers."" The truth is they were built as an insurance option - to be used as a last resort. So instead hospitals have focused on managing demand. That means a ruthless prioritisation of care. Routine work, such as knee and hip replacements, has been cancelled in the areas that are facing the most pressure to free up space. That is why it is no coincidence - despite the variation in Covid cases across the country - that regionally, hospitals have very similar levels of occupied beds once you take into account Covid and non-Covid patients. Hospitals have been carefully managing demand to ensure they have a bit of wriggle room available. But there is, of course, a limit to how long that can work. Even then though doubts remain about how much use the Nightingales will be. As well as staffing, some have argued there is just not the equipment available to treat the sickest patients, who can suffer everything from blood clotting to multiple organ failure. ""We can given them oxygen, but that's about it,"" said one doctor who worked in one of the Nightingales in the first wave. ""In some there are not even appropriate toilet facilities. They were built in a rush because we were desperate."" Despite the problems, Chris Hopson of NHS Providers, which represents hospital trusts, believes it was still the right decision to build them. ""Remember in the spring, Italian hospitals in Lombardy were overwhelmed. ""We needed an insurance policy in case that happened."" He says even without the complex equipment, they could still have a role given many patients are now treated on general wards with oxygen therapy. But he says the NHS will use ""every ounce"" of existing capacity it can muster before the Nightingales are used routinely. He predicts the next 10 to 15 days will be crucial - and if the numbers coming into hospital do not start dropping, hospitals could find themselves getting very close to the limit. ""If we don't end up using them, we should think of that as a success,"" he added.

"Marie McCourt had hoped her daughter's killer would never get parole Killers who refuse to reveal where they hid a body could still be freed despite new laws aimed at denying them parole. Parole Board chief executive Martin Jones said even when Helen's Law starts next year the board was obliged to free inmates who pose no risk to the public. Helen's Law is named after Helen McCourt, from Merseyside, whose killer Ian Simms was freed from jail without disclosing the location of her remains. Her mother Marie McCourt said the law could have ""gone further"". Mr Jones said prisoners would be questioned and failure to co-operate may not work in their favour. But he said it was a ""really difficult area"" and the legislation does not simply mean ""no body, no parole"". Failure to co-operate and reveal such information is ""frowned upon"" by the board and could see a prisoner having requests for parole denied in the first instance, Mr Jones said. However, he added: ""What it cannot do is act as a complete block on your release. ""Ultimately if someone is no longer a risk, we must release them."" Helen McCourt was murdered by Ian Simms in 1988 Helen McCourt, a 22-year-old insurance clerk, vanished on her way home from work in 1988. Her body has never been found. Her killer Ian Simms was released from prison earlier this year after Mrs McCourtlost a legal bid to keep him behind bars. Mrs McCourt, 77, from St Helens, said Mr Jones's comments had ""belittled Helen's Law"". She said it was ""upsetting to hear the law may not have helped our case"" and that it was ""a very cruel time to put something like that in the papers"", causing her ""great distress."" She added: ""Simms has a violent history. How can they say a man like that - who also won't reveal information - is safe to be released? ""But they have to make sure Helen's Law makes it harder and makes it far more difficult than it has been."" Mum told to pay daughter's killer Â£40k legal fees Helen McCourt murderer released from prison Mum's relief as Helen's Law passed unopposed Mrs McCourt said: ""I acknowledge this is not a 'no body, no parole law'â¦ I respect people's lives."" But to conceal where victims' remains are located is ""an offence against humanity"" and ""every family should have a chance to say a last goodbye"", she added. The timing of Mr Jones's comments ""just days before Christmas, is hugely insensitive to victims [and] has deeply upset Marie McCourt and many families"", said her MP, Conor McGinn. The Labour representative for St Helen's North wrote in a Tweet: ""The will of Parliament on Helen's Law is clear [and] so is the duty of the Parole Board."" Ms McCourt's family spent five years calling for legislation to help give grieving relatives closure. The Prisoners (Disclosure Of Information About Victims) Bill finally gained Royal Assent last month after a series of political and constitutional setbacks. The law sets out to toughen up existing guidelines, making it a legal requirement for the Parole Board to take into account a killer's failure to disclose the location of their victim's remains when considering them for release. It will also apply to paedophiles who refuse to identify those they abused.

"A farming community of 50 people who all live together said their way of life had ""come into its own"" during the coronavirus pandemic. The group, which dates back to 1974, share a house in East Bergholt, Suffolk, where they live off 70 acres (28 hectares) of land. They said they had seen a large rise in applications to join them recently. Community member David Hodgson said it had been a ""blessing"" to live there and share their skills during the crisis. ""Within our group we have an incredible set of skills that are put to use for the benefit of us all,"" the 71-year-old added. The house was a convent, an Army barracks and then a friary before it was bought in 1974 by a group of families who wanted to form a community The community had managed to stay Covid-free by working together and being ""careful and vigilant"", he said. Several of its members are classed as vulnerable, including one resident who is 99 years old. 'Au pairs are a practical solution to a problem' Paddleboarder 'falls in love again' with hometown Lockdown band working with Bond film composer They decided to introduce their own social restrictions early in March, ahead of the national lockdown later that month, and have held regular meetings to work out how best to protect themselves. Singing, yoga and philosophy groups which are usually open to the public have all been paused and they have imposed a strict cleaning rota. Social distancing had been relatively easy due to the amount of space they have, with their self-sufficient lifestyle well suited to a lockdown, David said. They said there had been a 300% increase in applications to join the community during the pandemic. Members buy a share and pay an annual charge to live there. Most also have part-time jobs in the outside world, but must commit to about 15 hours of work a week in the house and its grounds. They breed sheep and pigs, grow fruit, vegetables and wheat for bread, milk their own cows and make butter, cheese and yoghurt. They also generate their own heat and electricity. The community has enjoyed many socially-distanced campfire meals this year During the first lockdown, the members made face masks and opened their own tuck shop, while holding meditation sessions and enjoying socially-distanced campfire meals and maypole dancing. ""If something is needed from the shop or the pharmacy in the village then the request goes out on social media and someone in the community will take up the action,"" David noted inhis blog,externalabout life there during the first lockdown. The community said it kept tight rules in place throughout the summer, despite the national easing of restrictions. David said: ""We cautiously allowed some potential members to visit the community and some friends and family between lockdown one and two. ""To accommodate this, we cleared a sheltered area under some trees, constructed a compost toilet and a temporary field kitchen so that our families could camp. ""Stays were limited to three nights. This enabled us to see family without letting them into the building."" The 16th Century manor house, which has more than 100 rooms, has also been a convent, an army barracks and a Franciscan friary before it was bought in 1974 by 14 families who formed the community. David Hodgson worked in the architectural profession before he moved to the community in 1989 David worked in architecture before he moved there in 1989. He brought up two children and worked locally three days a week as a design lecturer to supplement his lifestyle. He retired early to spend most of his time working in the orchards and vegetable gardens. He said members were looking forward to Christmas, and would have a socially-distanced meal on Christmas Day. ""The children here are enjoying daily advent activities running up to Christmas. Anything from a treasure hunt to biscuit-making to decoration-making workshops,"" he said. He said they would not let their guards down over the festive period and would continue to protect each other, acknowledging that Covid was ""by no means over"" despite thestart of the national vaccination programme.

Canada's health agency authorised the Moderna vaccine on Wednesday, saying in a release that ""after a thorough, independent review of the evidence, it has determined that the Moderna vaccine meets the departmentâs stringent safety, efficacy and quality requirements"". Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said Canada will have 168,000 doses by the end of the month. In the US, where the Covid case count has topped 18 million, the federal government has agreed to a $1.95bn deal with Pfizer for 100m doses. At least 70m will be delivered by 30 June. The US Centers for Disease Control reports that 4.6m doses have been delivered as of Monday, and more than 614,117 have been administered. BBC News Analysis Several counties in southern
England will
be put under tier four restrictions from Boxing Day. Other areas were also moved into a
higher tier as the government tries to contain the spread of the new variant of
Covid-19. All parts of England have been
placed in a tier depending on factors such as the speed at which the virus is
spreading or the strain on hospitals â four being the highest. Restrictions in these areas
include:  The whole of Wales has entered
another lockdown. Mainland Scotland and Northern Ireland start new lockdowns on
Boxing Day. Read more here. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Anyone singing In the Bleak
Midwinter may want to write another verse. Cases, numbers in hospital and
deaths are all going up. Itâs likely the NHS will soon be
dealing with more Covid patients than at the peak in April. The new variants are causing
concern â especially as the one detected first in the UK continued to spread
even during the November lockdown. Vaccines will be the solution, but
they take time to roll out and until then it is going to be rough. The only other tool we have to
stop the virus spreading is reducing our contacts with other people. Thatâs why millions more of us are
moving up the tiers on Boxing Day. The hope is that the night is darkest
before the dawn and that come Spring, the virusâs grip on our lives will start
to ease.  As we mentioned earlier, ministers in
Ireland are self-isolating and awaiting test results after a minister tested
positive. Charlie McConalogue displayed no
symptoms but is self-isolating, his spokesman told the Irish Times. He received his test result several hours
after attending a cabinet meeting. The agriculture minister had been in
Brussels on government business over the last few days and was tested on his
return, according to broadcaster RTÃ. Read more here The first trucks have started leaving a temporary lorry park in Kent after France reopened its border with the UK. It follows clashes with between frustrated hauliers and police, as drivers have become increasingly impatient to get home for Christmas. France has lifted its ban on some UK arrivals, but only if they can show proof of a negative Covid test taken less than 72 hours before departure. ""We are very tired. We're staying in cars, we don't have a lot of food, no money,"" one lorry driver told the BBC. ""We just want to do the test and just go straight home,"" said another. A huge backlog of traffic remains. It all adds to the pressure on the authorities to get as many tests done as quickly as possible. Read more.  Members of New York Cityâs Sheriffâs office
will conduct home visits to ensure people from the UK are quarantining, Mayor
Bill de Blasio said. International visitors to the city
will be handed an order to quarantine and could face a $1,000 (Â£740) a day fine if
found not complying with the rules. âWe cannot take chances with anyone
who travels, particularly folks traveling in from the U.K.,â de Blasio said. New York was the epicentre of the
outbreak in the US earlier this year. The US state of New York has recorded
36,724 deaths since the outbreak began. Volunteers from KhalsaAid provided more than 800 meals to stranded drivers Teams of volunteers have delivered hundreds of meals to lorry drivers stranded in Kent. Members of Maidenhead's KhalsaAid travelled 80 miles (130km) to take food to drivers hit by delays at the border. On Tuesday, some of the Sikh charity's LangarAid members travelled almost double the distance, from Coventry, to bring water and food. KhalsaAid founder Ravi Singh said: ""It's horrible for [the drivers], there's nothing here - no food, no shops - it's like a prison for them. ""We can't sit back and do nothing."" Read more. This video can not be played Covid: Variant from SA 'yet more transmissible' The health secretary has described the new variant of coronavirus which came to light in South Africa as "" highly concerning"". Matt Hancock said the variant was ""more transmissible and appears to have mutated further than the new variant that has been discovered in the UK"". In consequence, he said the government was quarantining the two cases found in the UK, as well as their close contacts. The UK government is also placing ""immediate restrictions"" on travel from South Africa. Mr Hancock said anyone who had been in South Africa in the past fortnight, or who had had contact with someone who had been in South Africa in the last two weeks, ""must quarantine immediately"".  Hundreds of immigrants in France
working on the coronavirus front line have been recognised with fast-track
citizenship. The interior ministry invited
residents helping with efforts against Covid-19 to apply for accelerated
naturalisation. More than 700 people, including healthcare
professionals, cleaners and shop workers, have already been granted citizenship
or are in the final stages of receiving it. Read more here Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News Just as weâve got used to the idea of one worrying variant of this coronavirus, another one comes along. The newest one, which has been brought from South Africa in recent weeks and infected two people in the UK, is âhighly concerningâ, says Health Secretary Matt Hancock. It comes hot on the heels of the discovery of another variant in Kent causing sharply rising cases in the south and east of England, which will mean strict tier four restrictions being introduced in more areas of England on Boxing Day. These are two different variants, but they have some similarities and share a mutation. Crucially they are both concerning, leading to large increases in cases in South African and the UK. UK scientists are skilled at genomic sequencing - the technique used to track mutations of the virus. Thatâs the main reason these variants have been found quickly and acted upon, but just because other countries havenât detected them yet doesnât mean they arenât present. The faster they can be found, the more quickly they can be squashed. With hospital admissions rising to near levels of the spring peak and deaths increasing daily, ministers have no choice but to act quickly. Cutting social contact between people, tighter rules on travel and rapid testing â which is being rolled out to workers in care homes and is planned in schools and many local authorities â are the tools they are using to fight the virus on all fronts. In the last two weeks, California has seen half a million new coronavirus cases. On Tuesday, America's most populous state hit two million Covid-19 cases and more than 23,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University data. Officials now predict hospital admissions could reach 100,000 in January if the spread continues. The spike has left the state's health system overwhelmed. A number of intensive care facilities have been operating at over-maximum capacity, with less than 2% bed availability statewide. In Southern California, there is 0% ICU availability, local media report. The state is also seeing a shortage of medical staff - and is now turning outside the US, to places like Australia and Taiwan, to seek temporary medical workers, the AP reports. Health experts have continued to urge residents to practice social distancing during the rest of the holiday season, emphasising that hospitals may not be able to handle any further strain. The number of daily positive cases in the UK has hit another record high, with39,237,externalpositive cases reported in the past 24 hours. However, cases were thought to be higher in the UK during the spring peak when testing was much more limited. Government data shows a further 744 people have died within 28 days of a positive test. The total death toll now stands at 69,051. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Matt Hancock's message of hope at end of Christmas briefing Health Secretary Matt Hancock has urged the British public ""not to give up now"". ""We know what we can control this virus; we know that we can get through this together,"" he said, after announcing new tier restrictions to be imposed on large swathes of England from Boxing Day. ""I believe that everybody will do what is needed to keep themselves and others safe, especially this Christmas,"" he said. ""And I know, from the bottom of my heart, that there are brighter skies ahead."" Today's Downing Street briefing has now come to an end. Health Secretary Matt Hancock acknowledged that 2020 had been ""a hard year"" and despite all our efforts, the new variant of Covid-19 made further action ""difficult but necessary"". Here's what we learned at the press conference: The last question comes from Arj Singh from HuffPost. He asks if, given the highly-transmissible new variant, the government is guilty of overpromising by suggesting the UK can return to normality by Easter. Hancock replies that he is ""highly confident we will get things back to normal before 2022"" adding that the speed of the vaccine roll-out is accelerating. And that is the final question. Hancock wishes everyone a happy Christmas before leaving the lectern. Sam Lister from the Daily Express asks how many people will be vaccinated by Easter. Mr Hancock says he would love ""to have a stab at the answer"" but it depends hugely on the speed of production on the array of different vaccines that the UK has purchased. He says he does not want to put pressure on regulators in terms of approving the Astra-Zeneca Oxford vaccine, knowing that they will undertake their work as thoroughly as possible. He says the roll-out of the vaccine will be a ""big task"" for the NHS. ""The true answer will be as fast as we possibly can."" Dr Harries said we shouldn't jump to conclusions on transmission in schools Jane Merrick of the i asks why the whole country isn't going into lockdown. She also asks if, given evidence of increased infections among the under-15s, there is a case for mass testing in primary schools and a staggered return for primary schools as well as secondaries. Hancock says the new variant is highly concentrated and the new tier rules are aimed at keeping the variant in the South East. Dr Hopkins says ""we have no evidence this virus is more transmissible in children yet"". ""We will constantly take decisions with the experts in education over what is best for the children, along with controlling the virus,"" she adds. Dr Harries says: ""We shouldn't jump to the conclusion that just because every child is in school that it is a significant place for transmission."" Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent Will all of England end up in tier four? The health secretary says he wants action to be ""proportionate"" and that the
current tiers system is working. So that suggests more of ahopefully not,rather thannever. Wales has brought forward a lockdown. Northern Ireland will
enter one on Boxing Day. At the same time, mainland Scotland will go into the
tightest level of restrictions. Ministers in England are still trying to keep a
more local approach but, on future national measures, theyâre certainly not
ruling anything out. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,8.589488e-06
"This video can not be played ""I am kicking myself very hard"" - Nicola Sturgeon apologises for mask rule breach Scotland's first minister has apologised for breaching Covid rules by taking her face mask off at a wake. TheScottish Sun has published a photograph,externalof Nicola Sturgeon standing talking to three people at a social distance, but with her face uncovered. She was attending a wake after the funeral of a Scottish government civil servant who died with Covid. Ms Sturgeon had been wearing a tartan mask and is said to have taken it off briefly as she was leaving the venue. The Scottish government's Covid regulations say that customers in hospitality venues must wear a face covering except when seated - including when they are entering, exiting and moving around. Anyone who breaches the face covering rules can be punished by a fixed penalty notice of Â£60. However Police Scotland said they would not be taking any action, saying the first minister had apologised and ""acknowledged this inadvertent breach"" of the regulations. What are the latest Covid rules in Scotland? Scottish level four rules 'may be strengthened' In a statement, Ms Sturgeon said she had ""briefly"" removed her face mask while attending a wake, calling it a ""stupid mistake"". Addressing MSPs at Holyrood, the first minister said she wanted to express ""how sorry I am for my breach of rules that I ask all of us to follow"". Ms Sturgeon said: ""I want to be clear that regardless of the circumstances, I was in the wrong. There are no excuses. ""These rules do apply to me, just as they do to everyone else, and the rules really matter. ""I am kicking myself very hard - possibly harder than my worst critic ever could - but more importantly I'll be making sure I don't drop my guard again."" Ms Sturgeon is understood to have been at the wake in the Stable Bar and Restaurant in Edinburgh after attending a service at nearby Mortonhall Crematorium. The first minister regularly uses her daily coronavirus briefings to remind people to cover their faces to limit the risk of spreading the virus. Scotland's national clinical director Jason Leitch toldGood Morning Scotlandhe had spoken to Ms Sturgeon last night and she was ""furious with herself"". ""She is absolutely mad at this little lapse in concentration - it's so easily done,"" he said. ""We live in a completely different world from a year ago. ""She was leaving a funeral of a colleague of ours - a wonderful, wonderful individual who did a huge amount of work during the pandemic. It was an awfully sad day for many of us in the government who knew him and his family well. ""It just reinforces again to all of us, the nature of these instructions and this virus."" When you make and promote coronavirus rules, it is not a good idea to break them. No-one understands that better than Nicola Sturgeon, who has already parted company with an MP and a medical adviser for past breaches. The first minister has not taken a train journey having tested positive for the virus as MP Margaret Ferrier did. She had not made unnecessary trips to a holiday home during lockdown as her former chief medical officer, Catherine Calderwood, did. Nor has she taken a drive to Barnard Castle as the prime minister's former adviser Dominic Cummings did. Nicola Sturgeon's breach - removing her face mask briefly to talk to people at a funeral wake - is relatively minor. But it is a breach. That's why the first minister has put her hands up and apologised for what she calls a ""stupid mistake"". It is a mistake that anyone could make but when you're fronting the campaign to get the public to obey coronavirus rules, it does not make that job any easier. A Scottish Conservative spokesman said: ""The first minister should know better. By forgetting the rules and failing to set a proper example, she's undermining essential public health messaging. ""It's a blunder that an ordinary member of the public wouldn't get away with. There cannot be one rule for Nicola Sturgeon and another for everyone else."" Scotland's Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf said in a tweet that Ms Sturgeon had been ""upfront"" from the very beginning of the pandemic. ""She has apologised for [the] accidental lapse (which I suspect most of us have had one over last 9 months),""he wrote,external. He said the FM was her own harshest critic and that ""most people"" would accept her apology and move on. Jillian Evans, head of health intelligence at NHS Grampian, said high-profile breaches of Covid rules ""matter a lot"" to the public. She told the BBC'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme: ""There are clear breaches and then there are indiscretions. ""I'm not passing comment on anyone in particular, but some of us are prone to lapses now and again. ""The main thing is how honest and trustworthy our leaders are. I don't doubt anyone in Scotland's dedication to the cause but it really does matter, because everybody must follow the rules at all times as much as they possibly can.""

"Ministers are deciding whether more areas of England should be placed under the toughest coronavirus restrictions in a bid to contain the spread of a new variant of Covid-19. Cabinet minister Robert Jenrick said No 10 would make a judgement on whether the current rules were strong enough. He said there was no immediate plan to widen curbs on Boxing Day but ""the number of cases is rising"". Health Secretary Matt Hancock will lead a Downing Street briefing at 15:00 GMT. He will be joined by England's deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries and Dr Susan Hopkins of Public Health England. The Covid operations committee, chaired by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, has been discussing the tiered system - earlier than the 30 December official review date - amid concern over the rapid spread of the new variant. The latest change to restrictions placed London and large parts of south-east Englandunder new tier four rules, as millions saw theirfestive plans scrapped or severely restricted. It comes as the UK's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance previously warned that extra curbs were likely to be needed in more areas of England to control the new variant. Hetold a Downing Street briefing on Mondaythat measures could ""need to be increased in some places, in due course, not reduced"". Mr Jenrick said earlier that ministers were ""trying to retain the robust tiered system"" which takes a ""proportionate approach"" across the country, but said it had been designed before the new Covid variant became apparent. UK-France services return as travel ban eased Tighter Covid rules likely, top adviser warns Will virus variant force the Nightingales to open? He said the variant - whichcould be up to 70% more transmissiblethan previous strains - was now present in other areas of the country, albeit to a ""lesser extent"" than in London, south-east and the east of England. He said: ""The tiered system was designed before we knew the full ferocity of the new variant, and so we have to make sure it's sufficiently robust to be able to withstand this and to stop cases rising at the very worrying levels they are now in parts of the country."" Prof Neil Ferguson, whose scientific modelling led to the March lockdown, said the variant is ""everywhere now"" but said he anticipated that tier four restrictions and stricter rules over Christmas elsewhere could have a beneficial impact. He told the Commons Science and Technology Committee: ""Schools are now shut, we are in a near-lockdown situation across the country. Contact rates are lower over Christmas. ""I expect, though I hesitate to make any sort of predictions, we will see a flattening of the curve in the next two weeks. We will see at least a slowing of growth. ""The critical question is what happens in January and the extent we want to make public health measures more uniform across the country if the new variant is everywhere."" The UK's R value - the number of people thatone infected person will pass on a virus to, on average - is thought to have risen slightly to between 1.1 and 1.3 - up from 1.1 and 1.2 the week prior, according to the latest data published by the Government Office for Science and the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). On Tuesday, a further 36,804 people in the UK tested positive for the virus and there were 691 deaths within 28 days of a positive test, according togovernment figures.,external It is the largest daily number of cases recorded yet, though it is thought the infection rate was higher during the first peak in spring when testing was much more limited. The UK's devolved administrations have alsotightened restrictions to combat a rise in cases, withWales going into another lockdown earlier than plannedover the weekend. MainlandScotlandandNorthern Irelandstart new lockdowns on Boxing Day. SOCIAL DISTANCING:Can I give my friends a hug? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? Mr Jenrick said decisions from the committee would be communicated ""as soon as we can"" and that there was ""absolutely no plan"" at the moment to change restrictions before Christmas Day. Under the revisedChristmas rulesfor England, only people living in tiers one to three are permitted to socialise in a bubble of three households on 25 December. Those in tier four areas must only celebrate Christmas with members of their own household and support bubble. They will not be allowed to travel to other tiers to see family and friends. Mr Jenrick said the PM had been ""very clear"" that even outside of tier four, there was a ""strong degree of personal judgment to be exercised here"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""It's still up to people to come to a conclusion as to how many members of their family or other households they want to bring together on Christmas Day. ""The strong advice is to keep it small, to keep it short and therefore to be safe."" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has written to Mr Johnson to say his party will back any government moves to tighten restrictions if that is what scientists recommend. On Wednesday, Shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth urged the prime minister to act before it's too late. He told BBC Breakfast: ""What we're saying to Boris Johnson is, last time you received advice from the scientists for tougher restrictions, you sat on it, you dithered, you delayed."" He urged the PM not to ""sit on the advice this time"", adding ""we know delaying has devastating consequences. ""If you're advised to take tougher action, take it, do it, act with speed, don't be behind the curve again."" The Labour leader of Crawley Borough Council, which is currently in tier two but bordering tier four areas, has said the area would be hit hard by a potential tightening of restrictions, and accused the government of failing to provide support. Cllr Peter Lamb told BBC News that Crawley ""might"" be placed in a higher tier, adding that case numbers there ""would suggest that if it's not going in now, it will be going in at some point in the near future"". He said there had been ""no coming back"" for Crawley - which includes Gatwick airport - since the March lockdown, and it was ""still waiting"" for the government to ""give us some support to get through this"", adding that more businesses would be impacted if the area was placed under the toughest measures.

Canada's health agency authorised the Moderna vaccine on Wednesday, saying in a release that ""after a thorough, independent review of the evidence, it has determined that the Moderna vaccine meets the departmentâs stringent safety, efficacy and quality requirements"". Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said Canada will have 168,000 doses by the end of the month. In the US, where the Covid case count has topped 18 million, the federal government has agreed to a $1.95bn deal with Pfizer for 100m doses. At least 70m will be delivered by 30 June. The US Centers for Disease Control reports that 4.6m doses have been delivered as of Monday, and more than 614,117 have been administered. BBC News Analysis Several counties in southern
England will
be put under tier four restrictions from Boxing Day. Other areas were also moved into a
higher tier as the government tries to contain the spread of the new variant of
Covid-19. All parts of England have been
placed in a tier depending on factors such as the speed at which the virus is
spreading or the strain on hospitals â four being the highest. Restrictions in these areas
include:  The whole of Wales has entered
another lockdown. Mainland Scotland and Northern Ireland start new lockdowns on
Boxing Day. Read more here. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Anyone singing In the Bleak
Midwinter may want to write another verse. Cases, numbers in hospital and
deaths are all going up. Itâs likely the NHS will soon be
dealing with more Covid patients than at the peak in April. The new variants are causing
concern â especially as the one detected first in the UK continued to spread
even during the November lockdown. Vaccines will be the solution, but
they take time to roll out and until then it is going to be rough. The only other tool we have to
stop the virus spreading is reducing our contacts with other people. Thatâs why millions more of us are
moving up the tiers on Boxing Day. The hope is that the night is darkest
before the dawn and that come Spring, the virusâs grip on our lives will start
to ease.  As we mentioned earlier, ministers in
Ireland are self-isolating and awaiting test results after a minister tested
positive. Charlie McConalogue displayed no
symptoms but is self-isolating, his spokesman told the Irish Times. He received his test result several hours
after attending a cabinet meeting. The agriculture minister had been in
Brussels on government business over the last few days and was tested on his
return, according to broadcaster RTÃ. Read more here The first trucks have started leaving a temporary lorry park in Kent after France reopened its border with the UK. It follows clashes with between frustrated hauliers and police, as drivers have become increasingly impatient to get home for Christmas. France has lifted its ban on some UK arrivals, but only if they can show proof of a negative Covid test taken less than 72 hours before departure. ""We are very tired. We're staying in cars, we don't have a lot of food, no money,"" one lorry driver told the BBC. ""We just want to do the test and just go straight home,"" said another. A huge backlog of traffic remains. It all adds to the pressure on the authorities to get as many tests done as quickly as possible. Read more.  Members of New York Cityâs Sheriffâs office

Volunteers from KhalsaAid provided more than 800 meals to stranded drivers Teams of volunteers have delivered hundreds of meals to lorry drivers stranded in Kent. Members of Maidenhead's KhalsaAid travelled 80 miles (130km) to take food to drivers hit by delays at the border. On Tuesday, some of the Sikh charity's LangarAid members travelled almost double the distance, from Coventry, to bring water and food. KhalsaAid founder Ravi Singh said: ""It's horrible for [the drivers], there's nothing here - no food, no shops - it's like a prison for them. ""We can't sit back and do nothing."" Read more. This video can not be played Covid: Variant from SA 'yet more transmissible' The health secretary has described the new variant of coronavirus which came to light in South Africa as "" highly concerning"". Matt Hancock said the variant was ""more transmissible and appears to have mutated further than the new variant that has been discovered in the UK"". In consequence, he said the government was quarantining the two cases found in the UK, as well as their close contacts. The UK government is also placing ""immediate restrictions"" on travel from South Africa. Mr Hancock said anyone who had been in South Africa in the past fortnight, or who had had contact with someone who had been in South Africa in the last two weeks, ""must quarantine immediately"".  Hundreds of immigrants in France
working on the coronavirus front line have been recognised with fast-track
citizenship. The interior ministry invited
residents helping with efforts against Covid-19 to apply for accelerated
naturalisation. More than 700 people, including healthcare
professionals, cleaners and shop workers, have already been granted citizenship
or are in the final stages of receiving it. Read more here Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News Just as weâve got used to the idea of one worrying variant of this coronavirus, another one comes along. The newest one, which has been brought from South Africa in recent weeks and infected two people in the UK, is âhighly concerningâ, says Health Secretary Matt Hancock. It comes hot on the heels of the discovery of another variant in Kent causing sharply rising cases in the south and east of England, which will mean strict tier four restrictions being introduced in more areas of England on Boxing Day. These are two different variants, but they have some similarities and share a mutation. Crucially they are both concerning, leading to large increases in cases in South African and the UK. UK scientists are skilled at genomic sequencing - the technique used to track mutations of the virus. Thatâs the main reason these variants have been found quickly and acted upon, but just because other countries havenât detected them yet doesnât mean they arenât present. The faster they can be found, the more quickly they can be squashed. With hospital admissions rising to near levels of the spring peak and deaths increasing daily, ministers have no choice but to act quickly. Cutting social contact between people, tighter rules on travel and rapid testing â which is being rolled out to workers in care homes and is planned in schools and many local authorities â are the tools they are using to fight the virus on all fronts. In the last two weeks, California has seen half a million new coronavirus cases. On Tuesday, America's most populous state hit two million Covid-19 cases and more than 23,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University data. Officials now predict hospital admissions could reach 100,000 in January if the spread continues. The spike has left the state's health system overwhelmed. A number of intensive care facilities have been operating at over-maximum capacity, with less than 2% bed availability statewide. In Southern California, there is 0% ICU availability, local media report. The state is also seeing a shortage of medical staff - and is now turning outside the US, to places like Australia and Taiwan, to seek temporary medical workers, the AP reports. Health experts have continued to urge residents to practice social distancing during the rest of the holiday season, emphasising that hospitals may not be able to handle any further strain. The number of daily positive cases in the UK has hit another record high, with39,237,externalpositive cases reported in the past 24 hours. However, cases were thought to be higher in the UK during the spring peak when testing was much more limited. Government data shows a further 744 people have died within 28 days of a positive test. The total death toll now stands at 69,051. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Matt Hancock's message of hope at end of Christmas briefing Health Secretary Matt Hancock has urged the British public ""not to give up now"". ""We know what we can control this virus; we know that we can get through this together,"" he said, after announcing new tier restrictions to be imposed on large swathes of England from Boxing Day. ""I believe that everybody will do what is needed to keep themselves and others safe, especially this Christmas,"" he said. ""And I know, from the bottom of my heart, that there are brighter skies ahead."" Today's Downing Street briefing has now come to an end. Health Secretary Matt Hancock acknowledged that 2020 had been ""a hard year"" and despite all our efforts, the new variant of Covid-19 made further action ""difficult but necessary"". Here's what we learned at the press conference: The last question comes from Arj Singh from HuffPost. He asks if, given the highly-transmissible new variant, the government is guilty of overpromising by suggesting the UK can return to normality by Easter. Hancock replies that he is ""highly confident we will get things back to normal before 2022"" adding that the speed of the vaccine roll-out is accelerating. And that is the final question. Hancock wishes everyone a happy Christmas before leaving the lectern. Sam Lister from the Daily Express asks how many people will be vaccinated by Easter. Mr Hancock says he would love ""to have a stab at the answer"" but it depends hugely on the speed of production on the array of different vaccines that the UK has purchased. He says he does not want to put pressure on regulators in terms of approving the Astra-Zeneca Oxford vaccine, knowing that they will undertake their work as thoroughly as possible. He says the roll-out of the vaccine will be a ""big task"" for the NHS. ""The true answer will be as fast as we possibly can."" Dr Harries said we shouldn't jump to conclusions on transmission in schools Jane Merrick of the i asks why the whole country isn't going into lockdown. She also asks if, given evidence of increased infections among the under-15s, there is a case for mass testing in primary schools and a staggered return for primary schools as well as secondaries. Hancock says the new variant is highly concentrated and the new tier rules are aimed at keeping the variant in the South East. Dr Hopkins says ""we have no evidence this virus is more transmissible in children yet"". ""We will constantly take decisions with the experts in education over what is best for the children, along with controlling the virus,"" she adds. Dr Harries says: ""We shouldn't jump to the conclusion that just because every child is in school that it is a significant place for transmission."" Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent Will all of England end up in tier four? The health secretary says he wants action to be ""proportionate"" and that the
current tiers system is working. So that suggests more of ahopefully not,rather thannever. Wales has brought forward a lockdown. Northern Ireland will
enter one on Boxing Day. At the same time, mainland Scotland will go into the
tightest level of restrictions. Ministers in England are still trying to keep a
more local approach but, on future national measures, theyâre certainly not
ruling anything out. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,0.008111991
"This video can not be played Trump asks Congress to amend Covid aid bill US President Trump has urged Congress to amend a $900bn (Â£670bn) coronavirus relief bill to more than triple its stimulus payments to Americans. In a video message posted on Twitter, he said the package ""really is a disgrace"", full of ""wasteful"" items. ""It's called the Covid relief bill, but it has almost nothing to do with Covid,"" he said. The $900bn bill includes one-off $600 payments to most Americans, but Mr Trump said the figure should be $2,000. His statement stunned Capitol Hill. Republicans and Democrats have been negotiating a coronavirus stimulus rescue package since July and Mr Trump - who has largely stayed out of the talks - had been expected to sign the legislation into law following its passage through Congress on Monday night. Hunger spikes, demand rises for US food banks Unemployed in the US: 'I donât know what to do' Counting down the days to losing a home The package of measures is linked to a bigger government spending bill, which includes foreign aid funding as well as a $1.4tn spending measure to fund federal agencies for the next nine months. Those agencies will have to shut if the president vetoes or refuses to sign it by midnight next Monday. Most legislation that comes from Congress requires the approval of the president before becoming law. If the president rejects this bill, it would require at least a two-thirds majority in each chamber - the House of Representatives and the Senate - to override the veto. However, Mr Trump has not specifically said he would veto the bill. WhileCongress has overridden fewer than 10% of all presidential vetoes,external, US media say there could be enough votes from both Democrats and Republicans in Congress to do so in this instance. In Tuesday night's message from the White House, Mr Trump baulked at spending in the bill on other countries, arguing that this money should go to struggling Americans. He said: ""This bill contains $85.5m for assistance to Cambodia, $134m to Burma, $1.3bn for Egypt and the Egyptian military, which will go out and buy almost exclusively Russian military equipment, $25m for democracy and gender programmes in Pakistan, $505m to Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama."" The president questioned why the Kennedy Center, a performing arts complex in Washington DC, was set to receive $40m when it is not open, and more than $1bn has been allocated to museums and galleries in the capital. Mr Trump concluded: ""Congress found plenty of money for foreign countries, lobbyists and special interests, while sending the bare minimum to the American people who need it. It wasn't their fault. It was China's fault. ""I am asking Congress to amend this bill and increase the ridiculously low $600 to $2,000 or $4,000 for a couple. This video can not be played ""I'm not sure how we're going to survive"" ""I'm also asking Congress to immediately get rid of the wasteful and unnecessary items from this legislation and to send me a suitable bill, or else the next administration will have to deliver a Covid relief package."" On Monday afternoon, congressional leaders unveiled a 5,593-page package and voted on it several hours later. Several lawmakers protested that they had not been given an opportunity to read the contents. Nevertheless the bill sailed through the House of Representatives by 359-53 and the Senate by 92-6. This video can not be played 'We used to donate to this food bank, now we rely on it' The relief package contains a number of provisions that will help tens of millions of Americans struggling to make ends meet in the pandemic-battered economy. The one-off payments of $600 are half the sum provided by the last major coronavirus aid bill in March, which contained $2.4tn in economic relief. Monday's package extends federal jobless benefits of up to $300 per week for 11 weeks, although this again is half the amount provided by the previous bill. The package contains $25bn in rental aid and extends an eviction moratorium that was due to expire at the end of this month, a lifeline for millions of Americans. The bill also bans surprise medical billing - where hospital patients get slapped with often exorbitant stealth fees because they were treated by a doctor who was not covered by their health insurer. But after poring over the mammoth legislation, journalists and critics have highlighted a string of alleged giveaways for lobbyists. The Washington Post, for example, reports that the package contains $110bn in tax breaks for sectors such as the liquor industry and motorsports entertainment. On Tuesday, President-elect Joseph Biden said the coronavirus bill was merely a ""down payment"" and vowed he would press lawmakers to pass another stimulus bill after he enters office next month. ""Congress did its job this week,"" the Democrat said, speaking from his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, ""and I can and I must ask them to do it again next year."" This video can not be played Joe Biden: 'Darkest days' ahead in the battle against Covid The most powerful congressional Democrat, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, usually a fierce antagonist of the president, said she agreed with Mr Trump's call for $2,000 one-off stimulus payments for every American. ""Let's do it!"" she tweeted, pledging that her party would bring the proposal to the floor this week. Such a plan would need to be passed by the Republican-controlled Senate, where it may well face resistance. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, a staunch ally of President Trump, responded to Ms Pelosi with his own tweets welcoming her support for increasing payments, and saying ""let's go further"" and ""agree with President Trump that Big Tech needs to be reined in by winding down Section 230 liability protections"". The Democratic minority leader of the Senate, Chuck Schumer, tweeted: ""Trump needs to sign the bill to help people and keep the government open and we're glad to pass more aid Americans need"".

"George Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russia Donald Trump has issued pardons to 15 people including two figures convicted of lying to the FBI during an inquiry into the US president's campaign. Ex-campaign aide George Papadopoulos and attorney Alex van der Zwaan are among those who received the presidential clemency. Mr Trump also pardoned four security guards involved in a 2007 massacre in Iraq and two ex-congressmen. He is expected to issue more pardons before leaving office next month. It is common for outgoing presidents to use their right to issue pardons, which wipe out convictions. George Papadopoulos and Alex van der Zwaan both served brief jail sentences. Are we going to see a blitz of Trump pardons? The White House revolving door: Who's gone? Papadopoulos pleaded guiltyin 2017 to lying to the FBI about the timing of meetings with alleged go-betweens for Russia during the run-up to the 2016 election. He was the first former Trump aide to be arrested in the Russia investigation led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller. He falsely claimed that he had met two individuals with Russian connections prior to working with Donald Trump's campaign but had in fact met them after joining. On Twitter, he thanked President Trump and said the pardon meant ""the world to me and my family"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Van der Zwaan also admitted making false statementsduring the Mueller investigation. Mr Trump has repeatedly dismissed the Mueller investigation as ""a hoax"". ""Today's pardon helps correct the wrong that Mueller's team inflicted on so many people,"" the White House said in a statement. This video can not be played Are presidential pardons Trump's secret weapon? Also pardoned were former Republican lawmakers Chris Collins and Duncan Hunter. Former New York congressman Collins, a staunch supporter of Mr Trump,pleaded guilty in 2019 to charges of insider trading. He has been serving a 26-month prison sentence. Earlier this year, former California congressman Hunter was sentenced to 11 months in jail for misusing campaign funds. Four former Blackwater security guards - Nicholas Slatten, Paul Slough, Evan Liberty and Dustin Heard - were among those pardoned. They were convicted by a US federal judge ofshooting dead 14 Iraqi civilians in the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, in 2007,external. The 2007 incident in Baghdad's Nisoor Square caused an international outcry The guards opened fire with machine-guns in a square while escorting a US diplomatic convoy. The security firm said its guards were acting in self-defence, but witnesses and relatives of those killed maintain that the shooting was unprovoked. Two children were among the dead. The incident caused international outrage and sparked a debate over the role of defence contractors in war zones. Slatten was sentenced to life in prison for first-degree murder, while the others were sentenced to between 12 and 15 years in prison. There was no immediate response from the Iraqi government, but Hina Shamsi of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said Mr Trump had ""hit a disgraceful new low with the Blackwater pardons"". ""[The guards'] actions caused devastation in Iraq, shame and horror in the United States, and a worldwide scandal,"" she added. ""President Trump insults the memory of the Iraqi victims and further degrades his office with this action."" Witness History: Blackwater killed my son Blackwater incident: What happened,external As well as the 15 full pardons, Mr Trump commuted all or part of the sentences of five other people. Last month,the president pardoned his former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who had pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. However, Mr Trump has so far been less enthusiastic in using his right to grant clemency than any of his recent predecessors,according to the Pew Research Center,external. Barack Obama, whom Mr Trump replaced in 2017, granted 212 pardons and 1,715 commutations - the most since President Harry Truman in the 1940s and 1950s. By contrast, Mr Trump has now granted more than 40 pardons. Trump's use of presidential clemency has caused controversy because of the nature of his pardons and commutations, the research centre said. Many have had a ""personal or political connection to the president,"" according to a July analysis by the Lawfare blog. Are we going to see a blitz of Trump pardons?

Canada's health agency authorised the Moderna vaccine on Wednesday, saying in a release that ""after a thorough, independent review of the evidence, it has determined that the Moderna vaccine meets the departmentâs stringent safety, efficacy and quality requirements"". Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said Canada will have 168,000 doses by the end of the month. In the US, where the Covid case count has topped 18 million, the federal government has agreed to a $1.95bn deal with Pfizer for 100m doses. At least 70m will be delivered by 30 June. The US Centers for Disease Control reports that 4.6m doses have been delivered as of Monday, and more than 614,117 have been administered. BBC News Analysis Several counties in southern
England will
be put under tier four restrictions from Boxing Day. Other areas were also moved into a
higher tier as the government tries to contain the spread of the new variant of
Covid-19. All parts of England have been
placed in a tier depending on factors such as the speed at which the virus is
spreading or the strain on hospitals â four being the highest. Restrictions in these areas
include:  The whole of Wales has entered
another lockdown. Mainland Scotland and Northern Ireland start new lockdowns on
Boxing Day. Read more here. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Anyone singing In the Bleak
Midwinter may want to write another verse. Cases, numbers in hospital and
deaths are all going up. Itâs likely the NHS will soon be
dealing with more Covid patients than at the peak in April. The new variants are causing
concern â especially as the one detected first in the UK continued to spread
even during the November lockdown. Vaccines will be the solution, but
they take time to roll out and until then it is going to be rough. The only other tool we have to
stop the virus spreading is reducing our contacts with other people. Thatâs why millions more of us are
moving up the tiers on Boxing Day. The hope is that the night is darkest
before the dawn and that come Spring, the virusâs grip on our lives will start
to ease.  As we mentioned earlier, ministers in
Ireland are self-isolating and awaiting test results after a minister tested
positive. Charlie McConalogue displayed no
symptoms but is self-isolating, his spokesman told the Irish Times. He received his test result several hours
after attending a cabinet meeting. The agriculture minister had been in
Brussels on government business over the last few days and was tested on his
return, according to broadcaster RTÃ. Read more here The first trucks have started leaving a temporary lorry park in Kent after France reopened its border with the UK. It follows clashes with between frustrated hauliers and police, as drivers have become increasingly impatient to get home for Christmas. France has lifted its ban on some UK arrivals, but only if they can show proof of a negative Covid test taken less than 72 hours before departure. ""We are very tired. We're staying in cars, we don't have a lot of food, no money,"" one lorry driver told the BBC. ""We just want to do the test and just go straight home,"" said another. A huge backlog of traffic remains. It all adds to the pressure on the authorities to get as many tests done as quickly as possible. Read more.  Members of New York Cityâs Sheriffâs office

Bill de Blasio said. International visitors to the city
will be handed an order to quarantine and could face a $1,000 (Â£740) a day fine if
found not complying with the rules. âWe cannot take chances with anyone
who travels, particularly folks traveling in from the U.K.,â de Blasio said. New York was the epicentre of the
outbreak in the US earlier this year. The US state of New York has recorded
36,724 deaths since the outbreak began. Volunteers from KhalsaAid provided more than 800 meals to stranded drivers Teams of volunteers have delivered hundreds of meals to lorry drivers stranded in Kent. Members of Maidenhead's KhalsaAid travelled 80 miles (130km) to take food to drivers hit by delays at the border. On Tuesday, some of the Sikh charity's LangarAid members travelled almost double the distance, from Coventry, to bring water and food. KhalsaAid founder Ravi Singh said: ""It's horrible for [the drivers], there's nothing here - no food, no shops - it's like a prison for them. ""We can't sit back and do nothing."" Read more. This video can not be played Covid: Variant from SA 'yet more transmissible' The health secretary has described the new variant of coronavirus which came to light in South Africa as "" highly concerning"". Matt Hancock said the variant was ""more transmissible and appears to have mutated further than the new variant that has been discovered in the UK"". In consequence, he said the government was quarantining the two cases found in the UK, as well as their close contacts. The UK government is also placing ""immediate restrictions"" on travel from South Africa. Mr Hancock said anyone who had been in South Africa in the past fortnight, or who had had contact with someone who had been in South Africa in the last two weeks, ""must quarantine immediately"".  Hundreds of immigrants in France
working on the coronavirus front line have been recognised with fast-track
citizenship. The interior ministry invited
residents helping with efforts against Covid-19 to apply for accelerated
naturalisation. More than 700 people, including healthcare
professionals, cleaners and shop workers, have already been granted citizenship
or are in the final stages of receiving it. Read more here Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News Just as weâve got used to the idea of one worrying variant of this coronavirus, another one comes along. The newest one, which has been brought from South Africa in recent weeks and infected two people in the UK, is âhighly concerningâ, says Health Secretary Matt Hancock. It comes hot on the heels of the discovery of another variant in Kent causing sharply rising cases in the south and east of England, which will mean strict tier four restrictions being introduced in more areas of England on Boxing Day. These are two different variants, but they have some similarities and share a mutation. Crucially they are both concerning, leading to large increases in cases in South African and the UK. UK scientists are skilled at genomic sequencing - the technique used to track mutations of the virus. Thatâs the main reason these variants have been found quickly and acted upon, but just because other countries havenât detected them yet doesnât mean they arenât present. The faster they can be found, the more quickly they can be squashed. With hospital admissions rising to near levels of the spring peak and deaths increasing daily, ministers have no choice but to act quickly. Cutting social contact between people, tighter rules on travel and rapid testing â which is being rolled out to workers in care homes and is planned in schools and many local authorities â are the tools they are using to fight the virus on all fronts. In the last two weeks, California has seen half a million new coronavirus cases. On Tuesday, America's most populous state hit two million Covid-19 cases and more than 23,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University data. Officials now predict hospital admissions could reach 100,000 in January if the spread continues. The spike has left the state's health system overwhelmed. A number of intensive care facilities have been operating at over-maximum capacity, with less than 2% bed availability statewide. In Southern California, there is 0% ICU availability, local media report. The state is also seeing a shortage of medical staff - and is now turning outside the US, to places like Australia and Taiwan, to seek temporary medical workers, the AP reports. Health experts have continued to urge residents to practice social distancing during the rest of the holiday season, emphasising that hospitals may not be able to handle any further strain. The number of daily positive cases in the UK has hit another record high, with39,237,externalpositive cases reported in the past 24 hours. However, cases were thought to be higher in the UK during the spring peak when testing was much more limited. Government data shows a further 744 people have died within 28 days of a positive test. The total death toll now stands at 69,051. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Matt Hancock's message of hope at end of Christmas briefing Health Secretary Matt Hancock has urged the British public ""not to give up now"". ""We know what we can control this virus; we know that we can get through this together,"" he said, after announcing new tier restrictions to be imposed on large swathes of England from Boxing Day. ""I believe that everybody will do what is needed to keep themselves and others safe, especially this Christmas,"" he said. ""And I know, from the bottom of my heart, that there are brighter skies ahead."" Today's Downing Street briefing has now come to an end. Health Secretary Matt Hancock acknowledged that 2020 had been ""a hard year"" and despite all our efforts, the new variant of Covid-19 made further action ""difficult but necessary"". Here's what we learned at the press conference: The last question comes from Arj Singh from HuffPost. He asks if, given the highly-transmissible new variant, the government is guilty of overpromising by suggesting the UK can return to normality by Easter. Hancock replies that he is ""highly confident we will get things back to normal before 2022"" adding that the speed of the vaccine roll-out is accelerating. And that is the final question. Hancock wishes everyone a happy Christmas before leaving the lectern. Sam Lister from the Daily Express asks how many people will be vaccinated by Easter. Mr Hancock says he would love ""to have a stab at the answer"" but it depends hugely on the speed of production on the array of different vaccines that the UK has purchased. He says he does not want to put pressure on regulators in terms of approving the Astra-Zeneca Oxford vaccine, knowing that they will undertake their work as thoroughly as possible. He says the roll-out of the vaccine will be a ""big task"" for the NHS. ""The true answer will be as fast as we possibly can."" Dr Harries said we shouldn't jump to conclusions on transmission in schools Jane Merrick of the i asks why the whole country isn't going into lockdown. She also asks if, given evidence of increased infections among the under-15s, there is a case for mass testing in primary schools and a staggered return for primary schools as well as secondaries. Hancock says the new variant is highly concentrated and the new tier rules are aimed at keeping the variant in the South East. Dr Hopkins says ""we have no evidence this virus is more transmissible in children yet"". ""We will constantly take decisions with the experts in education over what is best for the children, along with controlling the virus,"" she adds. Dr Harries says: ""We shouldn't jump to the conclusion that just because every child is in school that it is a significant place for transmission."" Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent Will all of England end up in tier four? The health secretary says he wants action to be ""proportionate"" and that the
current tiers system is working. So that suggests more of ahopefully not,rather thannever. Wales has brought forward a lockdown. Northern Ireland will
enter one on Boxing Day. At the same time, mainland Scotland will go into the
tightest level of restrictions. Ministers in England are still trying to keep a
more local approach but, on future national measures, theyâre certainly not
ruling anything out. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,0.0017536483
"This video can not be played ""I am kicking myself very hard"" - Nicola Sturgeon apologises for mask rule breach Scotland's first minister has apologised for breaching Covid rules by taking her face mask off at a wake. TheScottish Sun has published a photograph,externalof Nicola Sturgeon standing talking to three people at a social distance, but with her face uncovered. She was attending a wake after the funeral of a Scottish government civil servant who died with Covid. Ms Sturgeon had been wearing a tartan mask and is said to have taken it off briefly as she was leaving the venue. The Scottish government's Covid regulations say that customers in hospitality venues must wear a face covering except when seated - including when they are entering, exiting and moving around. Anyone who breaches the face covering rules can be punished by a fixed penalty notice of Â£60. However Police Scotland said they would not be taking any action, saying the first minister had apologised and ""acknowledged this inadvertent breach"" of the regulations. What are the latest Covid rules in Scotland? Scottish level four rules 'may be strengthened' In a statement, Ms Sturgeon said she had ""briefly"" removed her face mask while attending a wake, calling it a ""stupid mistake"". Addressing MSPs at Holyrood, the first minister said she wanted to express ""how sorry I am for my breach of rules that I ask all of us to follow"". Ms Sturgeon said: ""I want to be clear that regardless of the circumstances, I was in the wrong. There are no excuses. ""These rules do apply to me, just as they do to everyone else, and the rules really matter. ""I am kicking myself very hard - possibly harder than my worst critic ever could - but more importantly I'll be making sure I don't drop my guard again."" Ms Sturgeon is understood to have been at the wake in the Stable Bar and Restaurant in Edinburgh after attending a service at nearby Mortonhall Crematorium. The first minister regularly uses her daily coronavirus briefings to remind people to cover their faces to limit the risk of spreading the virus. Scotland's national clinical director Jason Leitch toldGood Morning Scotlandhe had spoken to Ms Sturgeon last night and she was ""furious with herself"". ""She is absolutely mad at this little lapse in concentration - it's so easily done,"" he said. ""We live in a completely different world from a year ago. ""She was leaving a funeral of a colleague of ours - a wonderful, wonderful individual who did a huge amount of work during the pandemic. It was an awfully sad day for many of us in the government who knew him and his family well. ""It just reinforces again to all of us, the nature of these instructions and this virus."" When you make and promote coronavirus rules, it is not a good idea to break them. No-one understands that better than Nicola Sturgeon, who has already parted company with an MP and a medical adviser for past breaches. The first minister has not taken a train journey having tested positive for the virus as MP Margaret Ferrier did. She had not made unnecessary trips to a holiday home during lockdown as her former chief medical officer, Catherine Calderwood, did. Nor has she taken a drive to Barnard Castle as the prime minister's former adviser Dominic Cummings did. Nicola Sturgeon's breach - removing her face mask briefly to talk to people at a funeral wake - is relatively minor. But it is a breach. That's why the first minister has put her hands up and apologised for what she calls a ""stupid mistake"". It is a mistake that anyone could make but when you're fronting the campaign to get the public to obey coronavirus rules, it does not make that job any easier. A Scottish Conservative spokesman said: ""The first minister should know better. By forgetting the rules and failing to set a proper example, she's undermining essential public health messaging. ""It's a blunder that an ordinary member of the public wouldn't get away with. There cannot be one rule for Nicola Sturgeon and another for everyone else."" Scotland's Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf said in a tweet that Ms Sturgeon had been ""upfront"" from the very beginning of the pandemic. ""She has apologised for [the] accidental lapse (which I suspect most of us have had one over last 9 months),""he wrote,external. He said the FM was her own harshest critic and that ""most people"" would accept her apology and move on. Jillian Evans, head of health intelligence at NHS Grampian, said high-profile breaches of Covid rules ""matter a lot"" to the public. She told the BBC'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme: ""There are clear breaches and then there are indiscretions. ""I'm not passing comment on anyone in particular, but some of us are prone to lapses now and again. ""The main thing is how honest and trustworthy our leaders are. I don't doubt anyone in Scotland's dedication to the cause but it really does matter, because everybody must follow the rules at all times as much as they possibly can.""

"How did Grenfell Tower come to be covered in combustible materials when it was refurbished? That's the question the public inquiry into the west London fire in June 2017 which killed 72 people has been asking. This year the inquiry has heard more than 400 hours of evidence, from 53 witnesses. The team behind the BBC's Grenfell Tower Inquiry podcast has reported on all of it. Here's what we've learned. Two types of combustible plastic foam insulation were used on the outside of Grenfell Tower. Staff from Celotex, which made the majority of the insulation, say they behaved unethically, dishonestly and the company lied for commercial gainwhile getting their product approved for use on high-rise buildings. Combustible insulation could be used in these situations only if it passed a large-scale fire test. The inquiry was told Celotex added a non-combustible material to its test, to ensure flames would not reach the company's insulation. It hid the material's use from the fire test report, official certification bodies and even the company's sales staff. The second company involved was the market leader, Kingspan. For 14 years Kingspan's insulation was sold for use on high-rise buildings without a relevant large-scale fire test. Its insulation passed a test in 2005 but Kingspan changed the product a year later. Subsequent tests turned into a ""raging inferno"". Kingspan continued to sell its insulation using the 2005 test on the old material. This test was only withdrawn in October 2020 after the company accepted it did not represent the product on sale. When one company questioned Kingspan's approach to sales,technical manager Philip Heath wrote to friends to say they had confused him ""with someone who gives a damn"". Philip Heath apologised for the email and said he was ""in a dark place"" at the time he sent it because one of the friends he was messaging was terminally ill. Some witnesses didn't have a full grasp of the building regulations. The lead architect had never heard the phrase limited combustibility - the standard recommended for insulation on high-rise buildings. Others have told the inquiry they thought regulations were ambiguous. One fire test measured the spread of flame across the surface of a product. Those which performed the best were awarded a classification of Class 0. Kingspan took the surface off their insulation, a piece of foil thinner than a millimetre, and tested that on its own. Then they advertised their whole insulation product as Class 0 - a standard which it did not achieve. They told the inquiry this was permissible under testing criteria for England and Wales. Lead counsel to the inquiry, Richard Millett, suggested that using Kingspan's interpretation of the regulations, a stick of dynamite wrapped in foil could also be advertised as Class 0. Lead counsel to the inquiry Richard Millett hasaccused witnesses of taking part in a ""merry go-round of buck passing"".He said the public ""would be forced to conclude that everyone involved in the refurbishment of Grenfell Tower did what they were supposed to do and nobody made any serious or causative mistakes"". The inquiry heard how 17 companies worked on the refurbishment through a complex web of contracting and subcontracting. In evidence, witnesses said they thought other companies were responsible for fire safety. Specialist cladding contractor Harley sent its drawings to architecture firm Studio E. Harley witnesses told the inquiry they thought the architects were checking that designs met regulations. Studio E said it thought it only had to examine the building's aesthetics and 'functional utility'. Parts of the drawings which breached regulations slipped through these gaps. Construction professionals often relied on meetings with sales staff to decide whether a material was suitable for use. Celotex's marketing department wrote that those most likely to buy its insulation included anyone who wasn't aware there were restrictionson which materials were permitted for use on high-rise buildings. The fire broke out in the kitchen of a fourth floor flat in the 23-storey tower block just before 01:00 Celotex and Kingspan staff admitted their marketing material was misleading. Large-scale fire tests approved entire cladding systems, not individual products. But Kingspan and Celotex marketed their insulation as ""suitable for buildings over 18 metres in height"". Jonathan Roper of Celotex admitted this was deliberate and misleading. Philip Heath of Kingspan said he thought the company's marketing encouraged clients to contact them for more details. The inquiry heard evidence that on at least one occasion when this happened Kingspan then gave inaccurate evidence. Grenfell Tower was run by Kensington and Chelsea's Tenant Management Organisation (TMO). It hired companies for the Grenfell Tower refurbishment. The TMO hired architects Studio E who had never clad a high-rise residential building before. (The firm had designed the school and leisure centre opposite Grenfell.) Under EU rules, expensive public projects were subject to a competitive tender process.  When hiring Studio E, TMO staff admitted that they expected the fees would be under Â£174,000, so they wouldn't have to go through this. Studio E has admitted that had there been a competitive tender process, it would not have won it. While appointing a main contractor the TMO breached EU procurement rules by informing one of the companies, Rydon, it was in pole position to win the work before the results were officially announced. The TMO acknowledges this created a 'risk of challenge' but says it was not illegal. TMO staff held a ""secret"" meeting with Rydon to discuss how to cut Â£800,000 in costs from the budget.This included using cheaper cladding materials. The TMO insists this was subject to the agreement of planners. One of the aims of the refurbishment was to improve the energy efficiency of the tower. A company called Max Fordham gave Grenfell an ""aspirational"" target of making the 1970s concrete block as efficient as a new build project. Max Fordham suggested two insulation materials that could achieve this.But they did not check the building regulation guidance to see if the products could be used. The architects, Studio E, also made no checks to see whether the combustible materials were compliant with building regulations. It described any concerns its staff may have had about the compliance of the insulation as an ""afterthought"". Many witnesses are asked whether, if they had their time again, they would do anything differently.Terry Ashton, who worked for the fire safety consultants Exova, was clear - he would have asked more questions. Exova completed three fire safety strategies for the Grenfell Tower refurbishment. None of them even acknowledged the crucial fact that the refurbishment involved cladding the outside of the building. Seventy-two people died as a result of the fire Mr Ashton said he would have expected the architects to have directly asked him to consider the safety of the cladding products. They did not, so he didn't. Other Exova staff failed to clarify missing information. Exova's fire safety strategy for the existing building used the word ""assumed"" 19 times in a 16-page report. After the fire, when investigators looked at the cladding that had been installed on Grenfell Tower, they found a catalogue of errors related to how it had been installed. Many cavity barriers - intended to stop fire spreading through cladding -  were poorly fitted or installed in the wrong place. Some were attached back to front, stopping them working. The company responsible for installing the cladding,Osborne Berry, admitted there were examples of unacceptable poor workmanship which should have been ripped out and redone. Grenfell Tower had new windows fitted. During the installation Rydon instructed its subcontractors, SD Plastering, to fill gaps around the windows with combustible insulation. They said neither knew it was combustible. On the night of the fire, this was the main route for the flames to spread into the cladding. Kensington and Chelsea's building control department approved the construction of the Grenfell refurbishment. The officer responsible accepted that his efforts fell below the standards of a reasonably competent building control inspector. John Hoban did not notice that cavity barriers had not been designed around the windows to stop flames spreading to the outside wall. He failed to recognise the cladding materials were not suitable for use together on high-rise buildings. Mr Hoban told the inquiry that as a result of local authority cuts, he was juggling up to 130 projects. A clerk of works was hired to inspect the work carried out on the cladding. His company charged more than Â£400 a day, but he said his remit was not to check whether the work met regulations, or matched architects' drawings.Jonathan White said he only checked that work was neat and tidy. The TMO consulted residents about plans for the building. TMO newsletters claimed there was ""no concern from residents about cladding the building"". But that was based on a meeting which just one resident attended. Information about fire retardancy was not given to residents. During the refurbishment, people complained about the standard of work.The project lead for the main contractor Rydon said the company and other contractors were under massive pressure from ""rebel residents"". During evidence he repeatedly called the residents of Grenfell Tower ""vocal"" and ""aggressive"". Complaints were also made about construction staff who knocked on windows asking for cups of tea, scared pets and dropped materials onto a public footpath. In January the inquiry expects to hear evidence from Arconic, which made the cladding panels. The inquiry has already found the product, with a combustible polyethylene core, was the main cause of the spread of the fire. Campaigners delivered a message to the French embassy in London urging witnesses for cladding firm Arconic residing in France to give evidence A lawyer who represents some of the bereaved, survivors and residents has described Arconic (along with the insulation manufacturers Celotex and Kingspan) as ""little more than crooks and killers""who ""knew their material would burn with lethal speed"". The inquiry has heard that in 2009, a senior Arconic employee called polyethylene cores ""dangerous"". In 2015, while cladding was being installed on Grenfell he wrote: ""We really need to stop proposing PE [polyethylene] â¦. We are in the 'know'."" It's unclear whether all the Arconic witnesses will give evidence. Some are arguing that a French law prevents them from disclosing commercial information in foreign judicial proceedings. Lead counsel to the inquiry Richard Millett has urged them to ""do the right thing"". Kate Lamble is the presenter and producer of the BBC's Grenfell Tower Inquiry Podcast. She has followed every day of evidence since the start of the hearings in June 2018. At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"Marston's is to take over the running of Brains pubs in a bid to save 1,300 jobs in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. The pub operator will take over the running of all 156 of the brewer's pubs, mainly in Wales. Brains said restrictions during the pandemic had put the business under ""significant financial pressure"". Chief executive Alistair Darby said the long-term agreement safeguarded 1,300 pub jobs. Under the agreement, Marston's will pay rent for the entire estate but keep the Brains name while running the pubs as a tenant. All pubs in Wales have been forced to close as the country battles the pandemic Brains closed more than 100 of its pubs after theWelsh Government announced an alcohol ban in pubs and restaurants at the start of Decemberin a bid curb the spread of the virus. On Saturday all pubs were forced to close their doors in the final days before Christmas as Wales entered a level four national lockdown. Last month the 138-year-old firm suggested the previous firebreak lockdown had cost it Â£1.6m. Fear pubs will 'go bust' unless rules relaxed Cardiff brewer Brains gets rid of 36,000 pints of beer The deal, which is expected to close in February, will add to Marston's 1,368 pubs in the UK, including 106 in Wales. Back in March, Brains announced plans tosell 40 of its pubs with workers warned of potential job losses due to economic uncertainty caused by Brexit. Ralph Findlay, Chief Executive of Marston's, said the pubs were a ""great fit"" within the operator's existing estate. ""We look forward to the pub teams joining us and to welcoming guests and the communities which they serve, back into these pubs as the country emerges from the pandemic over the weeks and months ahead,"" he said. The Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA) said the deal brought hope the pubs would survive, but added it would be disappointed if it marked steps towards closing the Cardiff brewery. ""It will be interesting to see what the details of this deal are, how the Marston's beer will sit alongside the Brains beer, and what the future is for the brewery itself,"" said CEO of CAMRA Tom Stainer. He added: ""This is good news, as we were worried that these pubs would be closed permanently, or sold for property development or non-pub use.""

"Macsen was very unwell in January after several chest infections not thought to be coronavirus-related The relaxation of Covid-19 restrictions in Wales on Christmas Day will allow many people to form a two-household bubble with loved ones. But thousands of people who have been shielding during the pandemic won't have that luxury. About 130,000 people in Wales deemed extremely vulnerable due to underlying health conditions have once again beentold to stay home by the Welsh Government. Although government-advised shieldingpreviously ended in August, many haven't been able to truly stop shielding since the start of the pandemic. BBC Wales has spoken to a number of people who are facing the prospect of not seeing their nearest and dearest this Christmas. Matthew and Lisa have two sons, nine-year-old Macsen and 12-year-old Ioan By any metric, Matthew and Lisa Williams and their sons Macsen and Ioan, from Swansea, have had a very difficult time during the pandemic. Nine-year-old Macsen has multiple neurological disorders caused by a rare genetic mutation, including quadriplegic cerebral palsy, uncontrolled epilepsy, cortical visual impairment and respiratory conditions. New coronavirus variant 'in every part of Wales' New coronavirus variant: What do we know? Communities rally with children's toys for Christmas It means he cannot sit, stand, roll or walk unaided, can have up to 40 seizures per day, has vision ""like looking through Swiss cheese"" and is fed through a tube. The family have been effectively shielding since January after Macsen became so unwell with chest infections that anaesthetists had to hold his head manually for hours at a time to help him breathe. Macsen, pictured left, and his brother Ioan both ""worship"" their grandparents - but will be unable to see them ""We kind of had a preview of what he would be like if he had Covid - if he had that now, I'm not sure he would be able to fight it,"" says Matthew. Although Christmas Day is usually spent together without guests, Matthew said the family would normally see grandparents and friends in the days before and after - but will be unable to this year. ""It's really sad for the kids - both worship their grandparents as well, so it's really sad knowing they are not going to physically see them,"" he explained. ""The biggest thing I'm thinking of is that Macsen loves Christmas in school. He's had a whole year without school and it's his favourite place in the world."" Matthew and Lisa both have health challenges of their own The demands of raising a child with needs as complex as Macsen's during a pandemic are unimaginable to most people, but both Matthew and Lisa also have health challenges of their own. Matthew hasCharcot-Marie-Tooth,externaldisease, a genetic condition which means he is losing strength in his limbs and is often physically exhausted. Lisa suffers with both chronic migraines - up to 25 a month without treatment - andendometriosis,external, which can cause debilitating pain and extremely heavy periods. Earlier in the pandemic, Ioan, who is 12 and in secondary school, had a cold which meant he had to isolate in his own bedroom for two weeks to avoid passing it on to Macsen. Lisa was looking after Ioan while Matthew looked after Macsen in another part of the house. ""When you think you're at your lowest point, something else happens,"" says Matthew Towards the end of the two weeks, Lisa caught a cold which meant Matthew had to continue looking after Macsen alone for another two weeks. ""I was at such a low point at the end of the four weeks that I broke down,"" said Matthew. TÅ· Hafan, a charity which cares for children with life-limiting conditions, stepped in and took Macsen in to give the family respite for a week or so. ""That's been our lives for nine years - when you think you are at the lowest point, something else happens,"" Matthew added. Rhiannon Jones, who has cerebral palsy and has been shielding, says her mental health has suffered from not seeing family Rhiannon Jones, 21, has cerebral palsy and has been living in a Leonard Cheshire care home for disabled people near Newport since she left her family home in October. Because her condition can affect her breathing, she has been forced to shield as she waits to be housed with her 22-year-old sister in Bridgend. ""I'm a very sociable person, so not seeing people has definitely impacted my mental health,"" she said. ""I was diagnosed with depression andPTSD,externalso it has not been a very good time for me, but the care staff here have been so supportive."" Shielding alone 'felt like slippery slope to grave' Do people still have to shield and what are the rules? Vulnerable people share feelings on shielding Rhiannon said she has been shielding since the first lockdown was announced in March, and accepts ""there's not much likelihood"" of seeing family over Christmas. ""It has felt like an eternity because I haven't been able to see my family,"" she said. ""Covid has made everything so impersonal. I thrive off my family support. I feel like I have been ostracised by Covid."" Dot, centre, pictured with her children Gary, Michael, Sean, Stephen, Martin, Collete and grandson Liam Dot Gallagher, 72, is full-time carer for her sons Gary, 47, who has learning disabilities andmuscular dystrophy,external, and Michael, 32, who hasDown's syndrome,external. Along with another son Martin, 53, the family have been shielding at their home in Holyhead since March. ""It's difficult. I'm used to most of my family being there,"" said Dot, who is chairwoman of learning disability charity Mencap on Anglesey. In total, Dot has five sons and a daughter who usually spend Christmas together. Dot's son Michael, 32, pictured with his girlfriend Alison ""We would all normally be together, and everyone would bring something to the table on Christmas Day,"" she said. But the sacrifices Dot and her family have already made have only stiffened her resolve to avoid letting their guard down. ""I'm not going to waste what I consider to be a year of our lives keeping them safe, just to enjoy two days at Christmas,"" she explained. Deborah Ho, director of care at TÅ· Hafan, said: ""This year, families are balancing the wish to see their families with the need to protect their child from the risks that Covid-19 presents. ""Many families have made the difficult decision to see families from a distance as opposed to face to face, meaning the loneliness and isolation they have felt throughout 2020 goes on."" The Leonard Cheshire charity urged people who are shielding ""to adhere to guidelines and use their own personal discretion to ensure they remain safe from the virus"". No plans for shielding to return in second wave I was shielding, what should I do from 19 July?

"A farming community of 50 people who all live together said their way of life had ""come into its own"" during the coronavirus pandemic. The group, which dates back to 1974, share a house in East Bergholt, Suffolk, where they live off 70 acres (28 hectares) of land. They said they had seen a large rise in applications to join them recently. Community member David Hodgson said it had been a ""blessing"" to live there and share their skills during the crisis. ""Within our group we have an incredible set of skills that are put to use for the benefit of us all,"" the 71-year-old added. The house was a convent, an Army barracks and then a friary before it was bought in 1974 by a group of families who wanted to form a community The community had managed to stay Covid-free by working together and being ""careful and vigilant"", he said. Several of its members are classed as vulnerable, including one resident who is 99 years old. 'Au pairs are a practical solution to a problem' Paddleboarder 'falls in love again' with hometown Lockdown band working with Bond film composer They decided to introduce their own social restrictions early in March, ahead of the national lockdown later that month, and have held regular meetings to work out how best to protect themselves. Singing, yoga and philosophy groups which are usually open to the public have all been paused and they have imposed a strict cleaning rota. Social distancing had been relatively easy due to the amount of space they have, with their self-sufficient lifestyle well suited to a lockdown, David said. They said there had been a 300% increase in applications to join the community during the pandemic. Members buy a share and pay an annual charge to live there. Most also have part-time jobs in the outside world, but must commit to about 15 hours of work a week in the house and its grounds. They breed sheep and pigs, grow fruit, vegetables and wheat for bread, milk their own cows and make butter, cheese and yoghurt. They also generate their own heat and electricity. The community has enjoyed many socially-distanced campfire meals this year During the first lockdown, the members made face masks and opened their own tuck shop, while holding meditation sessions and enjoying socially-distanced campfire meals and maypole dancing. ""If something is needed from the shop or the pharmacy in the village then the request goes out on social media and someone in the community will take up the action,"" David noted inhis blog,externalabout life there during the first lockdown. The community said it kept tight rules in place throughout the summer, despite the national easing of restrictions. David said: ""We cautiously allowed some potential members to visit the community and some friends and family between lockdown one and two. ""To accommodate this, we cleared a sheltered area under some trees, constructed a compost toilet and a temporary field kitchen so that our families could camp. ""Stays were limited to three nights. This enabled us to see family without letting them into the building."" The 16th Century manor house, which has more than 100 rooms, has also been a convent, an army barracks and a Franciscan friary before it was bought in 1974 by 14 families who formed the community. David Hodgson worked in the architectural profession before he moved to the community in 1989 David worked in architecture before he moved there in 1989. He brought up two children and worked locally three days a week as a design lecturer to supplement his lifestyle. He retired early to spend most of his time working in the orchards and vegetable gardens. He said members were looking forward to Christmas, and would have a socially-distanced meal on Christmas Day. ""The children here are enjoying daily advent activities running up to Christmas. Anything from a treasure hunt to biscuit-making to decoration-making workshops,"" he said. He said they would not let their guards down over the festive period and would continue to protect each other, acknowledging that Covid was ""by no means over"" despite thestart of the national vaccination programme.

Canada's health agency authorised the Moderna vaccine on Wednesday, saying in a release that ""after a thorough, independent review of the evidence, it has determined that the Moderna vaccine meets the departmentâs stringent safety, efficacy and quality requirements"". Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said Canada will have 168,000 doses by the end of the month. In the US, where the Covid case count has topped 18 million, the federal government has agreed to a $1.95bn deal with Pfizer for 100m doses. At least 70m will be delivered by 30 June. The US Centers for Disease Control reports that 4.6m doses have been delivered as of Monday, and more than 614,117 have been administered. BBC News Analysis Several counties in southern
England will
be put under tier four restrictions from Boxing Day. Other areas were also moved into a
higher tier as the government tries to contain the spread of the new variant of
Covid-19. All parts of England have been
placed in a tier depending on factors such as the speed at which the virus is
spreading or the strain on hospitals â four being the highest. Restrictions in these areas
include:  The whole of Wales has entered
another lockdown. Mainland Scotland and Northern Ireland start new lockdowns on
Boxing Day. Read more here. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Anyone singing In the Bleak
Midwinter may want to write another verse. Cases, numbers in hospital and
deaths are all going up. Itâs likely the NHS will soon be
dealing with more Covid patients than at the peak in April. The new variants are causing
concern â especially as the one detected first in the UK continued to spread
even during the November lockdown. Vaccines will be the solution, but
they take time to roll out and until then it is going to be rough. The only other tool we have to
stop the virus spreading is reducing our contacts with other people. Thatâs why millions more of us are
moving up the tiers on Boxing Day. The hope is that the night is darkest
before the dawn and that come Spring, the virusâs grip on our lives will start
to ease.  As we mentioned earlier, ministers in
Ireland are self-isolating and awaiting test results after a minister tested
positive. Charlie McConalogue displayed no
symptoms but is self-isolating, his spokesman told the Irish Times. He received his test result several hours
after attending a cabinet meeting. The agriculture minister had been in
Brussels on government business over the last few days and was tested on his
return, according to broadcaster RTÃ. Read more here The first trucks have started leaving a temporary lorry park in Kent after France reopened its border with the UK. It follows clashes with between frustrated hauliers and police, as drivers have become increasingly impatient to get home for Christmas. France has lifted its ban on some UK arrivals, but only if they can show proof of a negative Covid test taken less than 72 hours before departure. ""We are very tired. We're staying in cars, we don't have a lot of food, no money,"" one lorry driver told the BBC. ""We just want to do the test and just go straight home,"" said another. A huge backlog of traffic remains. It all adds to the pressure on the authorities to get as many tests done as quickly as possible. Read more.  Members of New York Cityâs Sheriffâs office

Members of Maidenhead's KhalsaAid travelled 80 miles (130km) to take food to drivers hit by delays at the border. On Tuesday, some of the Sikh charity's LangarAid members travelled almost double the distance, from Coventry, to bring water and food.

This video can not be played Covid: Variant from SA 'yet more transmissible' The health secretary has described the new variant of coronavirus which came to light in South Africa as "" highly concerning"". Matt Hancock said the variant was ""more transmissible and appears to have mutated further than the new variant that has been discovered in the UK"". In consequence, he said the government was quarantining the two cases found in the UK, as well as their close contacts. The UK government is also placing ""immediate restrictions"" on travel from South Africa. Mr Hancock said anyone who had been in South Africa in the past fortnight, or who had had contact with someone who had been in South Africa in the last two weeks, ""must quarantine immediately"".  Hundreds of immigrants in France
working on the coronavirus front line have been recognised with fast-track
citizenship. The interior ministry invited
residents helping with efforts against Covid-19 to apply for accelerated
naturalisation. More than 700 people, including healthcare
professionals, cleaners and shop workers, have already been granted citizenship
or are in the final stages of receiving it. Read more here Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News Just as weâve got used to the idea of one worrying variant of this coronavirus, another one comes along. The newest one, which has been brought from South Africa in recent weeks and infected two people in the UK, is âhighly concerningâ, says Health Secretary Matt Hancock. It comes hot on the heels of the discovery of another variant in Kent causing sharply rising cases in the south and east of England, which will mean strict tier four restrictions being introduced in more areas of England on Boxing Day. These are two different variants, but they have some similarities and share a mutation. Crucially they are both concerning, leading to large increases in cases in South African and the UK. UK scientists are skilled at genomic sequencing - the technique used to track mutations of the virus. Thatâs the main reason these variants have been found quickly and acted upon, but just because other countries havenât detected them yet doesnât mean they arenât present. The faster they can be found, the more quickly they can be squashed. With hospital admissions rising to near levels of the spring peak and deaths increasing daily, ministers have no choice but to act quickly. Cutting social contact between people, tighter rules on travel and rapid testing â which is being rolled out to workers in care homes and is planned in schools and many local authorities â are the tools they are using to fight the virus on all fronts. In the last two weeks, California has seen half a million new coronavirus cases. On Tuesday, America's most populous state hit two million Covid-19 cases and more than 23,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University data. Officials now predict hospital admissions could reach 100,000 in January if the spread continues. The spike has left the state's health system overwhelmed. A number of intensive care facilities have been operating at over-maximum capacity, with less than 2% bed availability statewide. In Southern California, there is 0% ICU availability, local media report. The state is also seeing a shortage of medical staff - and is now turning outside the US, to places like Australia and Taiwan, to seek temporary medical workers, the AP reports. Health experts have continued to urge residents to practice social distancing during the rest of the holiday season, emphasising that hospitals may not be able to handle any further strain. The number of daily positive cases in the UK has hit another record high, with39,237,externalpositive cases reported in the past 24 hours. However, cases were thought to be higher in the UK during the spring peak when testing was much more limited. Government data shows a further 744 people have died within 28 days of a positive test. The total death toll now stands at 69,051. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Matt Hancock's message of hope at end of Christmas briefing Health Secretary Matt Hancock has urged the British public ""not to give up now"". ""We know what we can control this virus; we know that we can get through this together,"" he said, after announcing new tier restrictions to be imposed on large swathes of England from Boxing Day. ""I believe that everybody will do what is needed to keep themselves and others safe, especially this Christmas,"" he said. ""And I know, from the bottom of my heart, that there are brighter skies ahead."" Today's Downing Street briefing has now come to an end. Health Secretary Matt Hancock acknowledged that 2020 had been ""a hard year"" and despite all our efforts, the new variant of Covid-19 made further action ""difficult but necessary"". Here's what we learned at the press conference: The last question comes from Arj Singh from HuffPost. He asks if, given the highly-transmissible new variant, the government is guilty of overpromising by suggesting the UK can return to normality by Easter. Hancock replies that he is ""highly confident we will get things back to normal before 2022"" adding that the speed of the vaccine roll-out is accelerating. And that is the final question. Hancock wishes everyone a happy Christmas before leaving the lectern. Sam Lister from the Daily Express asks how many people will be vaccinated by Easter. Mr Hancock says he would love ""to have a stab at the answer"" but it depends hugely on the speed of production on the array of different vaccines that the UK has purchased. He says he does not want to put pressure on regulators in terms of approving the Astra-Zeneca Oxford vaccine, knowing that they will undertake their work as thoroughly as possible. He says the roll-out of the vaccine will be a ""big task"" for the NHS. ""The true answer will be as fast as we possibly can."" Dr Harries said we shouldn't jump to conclusions on transmission in schools Jane Merrick of the i asks why the whole country isn't going into lockdown. She also asks if, given evidence of increased infections among the under-15s, there is a case for mass testing in primary schools and a staggered return for primary schools as well as secondaries. Hancock says the new variant is highly concentrated and the new tier rules are aimed at keeping the variant in the South East. Dr Hopkins says ""we have no evidence this virus is more transmissible in children yet"". ""We will constantly take decisions with the experts in education over what is best for the children, along with controlling the virus,"" she adds. Dr Harries says: ""We shouldn't jump to the conclusion that just because every child is in school that it is a significant place for transmission."" Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent Will all of England end up in tier four? The health secretary says he wants action to be ""proportionate"" and that the
current tiers system is working. So that suggests more of ahopefully not,rather thannever. Wales has brought forward a lockdown. Northern Ireland will
enter one on Boxing Day. At the same time, mainland Scotland will go into the
tightest level of restrictions. Ministers in England are still trying to keep a
more local approach but, on future national measures, theyâre certainly not
ruling anything out. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.7459796
"This video can not be played Trump asks Congress to amend Covid aid bill US President Trump has urged Congress to amend a $900bn (Â£670bn) coronavirus relief bill to more than triple its stimulus payments to Americans. In a video message posted on Twitter, he said the package ""really is a disgrace"", full of ""wasteful"" items. ""It's called the Covid relief bill, but it has almost nothing to do with Covid,"" he said. The $900bn bill includes one-off $600 payments to most Americans, but Mr Trump said the figure should be $2,000. His statement stunned Capitol Hill. Republicans and Democrats have been negotiating a coronavirus stimulus rescue package since July and Mr Trump - who has largely stayed out of the talks - had been expected to sign the legislation into law following its passage through Congress on Monday night. Hunger spikes, demand rises for US food banks Unemployed in the US: 'I donât know what to do' Counting down the days to losing a home The package of measures is linked to a bigger government spending bill, which includes foreign aid funding as well as a $1.4tn spending measure to fund federal agencies for the next nine months. Those agencies will have to shut if the president vetoes or refuses to sign it by midnight next Monday. Most legislation that comes from Congress requires the approval of the president before becoming law. If the president rejects this bill, it would require at least a two-thirds majority in each chamber - the House of Representatives and the Senate - to override the veto. However, Mr Trump has not specifically said he would veto the bill. WhileCongress has overridden fewer than 10% of all presidential vetoes,external, US media say there could be enough votes from both Democrats and Republicans in Congress to do so in this instance. In Tuesday night's message from the White House, Mr Trump baulked at spending in the bill on other countries, arguing that this money should go to struggling Americans. He said: ""This bill contains $85.5m for assistance to Cambodia, $134m to Burma, $1.3bn for Egypt and the Egyptian military, which will go out and buy almost exclusively Russian military equipment, $25m for democracy and gender programmes in Pakistan, $505m to Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama."" The president questioned why the Kennedy Center, a performing arts complex in Washington DC, was set to receive $40m when it is not open, and more than $1bn has been allocated to museums and galleries in the capital. Mr Trump concluded: ""Congress found plenty of money for foreign countries, lobbyists and special interests, while sending the bare minimum to the American people who need it. It wasn't their fault. It was China's fault. ""I am asking Congress to amend this bill and increase the ridiculously low $600 to $2,000 or $4,000 for a couple. This video can not be played ""I'm not sure how we're going to survive"" ""I'm also asking Congress to immediately get rid of the wasteful and unnecessary items from this legislation and to send me a suitable bill, or else the next administration will have to deliver a Covid relief package."" On Monday afternoon, congressional leaders unveiled a 5,593-page package and voted on it several hours later. Several lawmakers protested that they had not been given an opportunity to read the contents. Nevertheless the bill sailed through the House of Representatives by 359-53 and the Senate by 92-6. This video can not be played 'We used to donate to this food bank, now we rely on it' The relief package contains a number of provisions that will help tens of millions of Americans struggling to make ends meet in the pandemic-battered economy. The one-off payments of $600 are half the sum provided by the last major coronavirus aid bill in March, which contained $2.4tn in economic relief. Monday's package extends federal jobless benefits of up to $300 per week for 11 weeks, although this again is half the amount provided by the previous bill. The package contains $25bn in rental aid and extends an eviction moratorium that was due to expire at the end of this month, a lifeline for millions of Americans. The bill also bans surprise medical billing - where hospital patients get slapped with often exorbitant stealth fees because they were treated by a doctor who was not covered by their health insurer. But after poring over the mammoth legislation, journalists and critics have highlighted a string of alleged giveaways for lobbyists. The Washington Post, for example, reports that the package contains $110bn in tax breaks for sectors such as the liquor industry and motorsports entertainment. On Tuesday, President-elect Joseph Biden said the coronavirus bill was merely a ""down payment"" and vowed he would press lawmakers to pass another stimulus bill after he enters office next month. ""Congress did its job this week,"" the Democrat said, speaking from his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, ""and I can and I must ask them to do it again next year."" This video can not be played Joe Biden: 'Darkest days' ahead in the battle against Covid The most powerful congressional Democrat, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, usually a fierce antagonist of the president, said she agreed with Mr Trump's call for $2,000 one-off stimulus payments for every American. ""Let's do it!"" she tweeted, pledging that her party would bring the proposal to the floor this week. Such a plan would need to be passed by the Republican-controlled Senate, where it may well face resistance. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, a staunch ally of President Trump, responded to Ms Pelosi with his own tweets welcoming her support for increasing payments, and saying ""let's go further"" and ""agree with President Trump that Big Tech needs to be reined in by winding down Section 230 liability protections"". The Democratic minority leader of the Senate, Chuck Schumer, tweeted: ""Trump needs to sign the bill to help people and keep the government open and we're glad to pass more aid Americans need"".

"Marie McCourt had hoped her daughter's killer would never get parole Killers who refuse to reveal where they hid a body could still be freed despite new laws aimed at denying them parole. Parole Board chief executive Martin Jones said even when Helen's Law starts next year the board was obliged to free inmates who pose no risk to the public. Helen's Law is named after Helen McCourt, from Merseyside, whose killer Ian Simms was freed from jail without disclosing the location of her remains. Her mother Marie McCourt said the law could have ""gone further"". Mr Jones said prisoners would be questioned and failure to co-operate may not work in their favour. But he said it was a ""really difficult area"" and the legislation does not simply mean ""no body, no parole"". Failure to co-operate and reveal such information is ""frowned upon"" by the board and could see a prisoner having requests for parole denied in the first instance, Mr Jones said. However, he added: ""What it cannot do is act as a complete block on your release. ""Ultimately if someone is no longer a risk, we must release them."" Helen McCourt was murdered by Ian Simms in 1988 Helen McCourt, a 22-year-old insurance clerk, vanished on her way home from work in 1988. Her body has never been found. Her killer Ian Simms was released from prison earlier this year after Mrs McCourtlost a legal bid to keep him behind bars. Mrs McCourt, 77, from St Helens, said Mr Jones's comments had ""belittled Helen's Law"". She said it was ""upsetting to hear the law may not have helped our case"" and that it was ""a very cruel time to put something like that in the papers"", causing her ""great distress."" She added: ""Simms has a violent history. How can they say a man like that - who also won't reveal information - is safe to be released? ""But they have to make sure Helen's Law makes it harder and makes it far more difficult than it has been."" Mum told to pay daughter's killer Â£40k legal fees Helen McCourt murderer released from prison Mum's relief as Helen's Law passed unopposed Mrs McCourt said: ""I acknowledge this is not a 'no body, no parole law'â¦ I respect people's lives."" But to conceal where victims' remains are located is ""an offence against humanity"" and ""every family should have a chance to say a last goodbye"", she added. The timing of Mr Jones's comments ""just days before Christmas, is hugely insensitive to victims [and] has deeply upset Marie McCourt and many families"", said her MP, Conor McGinn. The Labour representative for St Helen's North wrote in a Tweet: ""The will of Parliament on Helen's Law is clear [and] so is the duty of the Parole Board."" Ms McCourt's family spent five years calling for legislation to help give grieving relatives closure. The Prisoners (Disclosure Of Information About Victims) Bill finally gained Royal Assent last month after a series of political and constitutional setbacks. The law sets out to toughen up existing guidelines, making it a legal requirement for the Parole Board to take into account a killer's failure to disclose the location of their victim's remains when considering them for release. It will also apply to paedophiles who refuse to identify those they abused.

"Many businesses had to close for most of November November saw the lowest number of planned redundancies in Britain since Covid lockdowns began, according to Insolvency Service data. In total 36,700 redundancies were proposed last month, down from a peak of 156,000 in June. The figures suggest that the chancellor's decision to extend the furlough scheme to the spring has helped to protect jobs. The data was released in response to a BBC Freedom of Information request. November saw a lockdown imposed across all of England, and restrictions in force in Wales and Scotland, as coronavirus levels rose. Though many businesses have been unable to trade during that time, there has not been a spike in redundancies like the one seen after the first lockdown. November's figure was up 32% on the same month last year, but far below the peaks seen in the summer. The numbers provide ""encouragement that there will be a steady trickle, rather than a tsunami, of job losses over the next few months,"" said Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at the Capital Economics consultancy. Sainsbury's, Gregg's, John Lewis and Edinburgh Woollen Mill were among the companies to announce job cuts in November. However, the closures of the big retailers Arcadia and Debenhams, affecting 25,000 jobs, were most likely too late to be included in November's figures. Some 550 employers notified government of plans to cut 20 or more jobs, the lowest figure since April, but still 80% higher than last November. Employers cutting fewer than 20 don't have to notify government. The last day of October was meant to see the end of the furlough scheme, where government pays most of a worker's wages when their employer cannot. Fearing a big rise in job losses if the scheme ended while much of the country was in lockdown, the chancellor extended it until 30 April. Together with other official data, the redundancy numbers suggest that ""the government's furlough scheme has minimised the labour market damage from Covid-19 so far,"" says Ms Gregory. Next year, employers still have to contend with the economic consequences of the fast-spreading new variant of the coronavirus, which has seen restrictions brought in over Christmas andmore than 40 countries close their borders to UK visitors. A new variant of coronavirus saw more than 40 countries close their borders to UK visitors There is also the possibility of disruption following a no-deal Brexit, which ""is probably the greatest risk, as it could lead to redundancies in firms and sectors that had been less impacted by the pandemic,"" said Tony Wilson, director of the Institute for Employment Studies. A government spokesperson said: ""We understand the pressure businesses and individuals are currently under which is why we're helping them through the pandemic with a Â£280bn support package, which is among the most generous in the world."" Employers are obliged to notify the Insolvency Service when they plan to make 20 or more workers redundant using a form called HR1. These are filed at the start of the redundancy process, so these figures indicate what is happening months ahead of the redundancy data collected by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). ONS data showed a record rise in redundancies in the period from August to October, to hit 370,000, a record level. This was foreshadowed in Insolvency Service redundancy figures for June and July, which were the highest seen on records going back to 2006. The total number of planned redundancies will be higher than the figures compiled by the Insolvency Service, as it doesn't include firms cutting fewer than 20 posts. However, individual employers often find ways to make fewer redundancies than they initially propose. Employers in Northern Ireland file HR1 forms with the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency, and they are not included in these figures. More than10,000 redundancieshave been proposed in Northern Ireland since the pandemic began.

"A taste of things to come? France's decision to stop lorry drivers entering from the UK could affect fresh food supplies France's decision to close the border with the UK to stop the spread of a new variant of the coronavirus has highlighted the importance of the Dover-Calais route for food supplies. French residents and nationals with recent negative coronavirus tests will be able to travel from Wednesday, and lorry drivers can do so after a rapid lateral flow test. So just how dependent is the UK on the EU for food? And should British shoppers be worried? About 30% of all the food we eat in the UK comes from the European Union, according to the British Retail Consortium (BRC) industry group. Britain imports nearly half of its fresh vegetables and the majority of its fruit, both mainly from the EU - and that's where the potential problem was. During the summer months, the UK can grow plenty of its own produce like lettuces and soft berries such as raspberries and strawberries, but when the weather turns colder Britain is forced to rely much more on imports from the EU. In January, for example, the UK imports 90% of the lettuces it needs from the EU. But in June, Britain produces 95% of its own salad leaves. Tomatoes follow the same pattern. In January, the UK buys in 85% of tomatoes from the European bloc, but by summer it is growing 60% of what the country needs. By the time winter rolls around, half of all the UK's food is imported, according to the Food and Drink Federation. It says that while there are no concerns about food supplies over Christmas, shoppers may have started to see gaps in fresh fruit and vegetable supplies from next week - had the UK and France not ""swiftly restored"" their links. When it comes to fresh food, the most efficient and cheapest way to get produce to the UK is in refrigerated trucks, using the ""roll-on roll-off"" method of transport. Food is loaded on the truck at a farm in Spain, for example, and is driven to Calais where it directly ""rolls on"" a ferry or the Eurotunnel and ""rolls off"" when it gets to Dover in the UK before heading to its final destination. These trucks are then loaded up with UK goods which are then sent back across the Channel to EU customers. The driver will stay with the truck - which is known as ""accompanied freight"" - and this is why there were some problems in recent days. France was concerned about drivers coming from the UK with the new variant of the coronavirus. Thousands of lorries got stuck in Kent waiting to get back into the EU. In the past, the UK has turned to other means when fresh produce has been under threat. In 2018, a summer heat wave meant the UK was eating more salad than usual but the hotter weather also made it difficult to actually grow lettuces. Thousands of iceberg lettuces were duly shipped in to the UK from Los Angeles. But this is an expensive method of replenishing supplies and it is doubtful businesses will want to pay a premium for shipping at a time when they could be facing tariffs on buying other goods from the EU depending on a Brexit deal. Despite assurances that plenty of food will be available, some shoppers found empty shelves Last year, the UK exported Â£14.2bn worth of food and drink to the EU, out of a total Â£23.6bn worldwide. The Food and Drink Federation says the UK's biggest exports are goods such as whisky, salmon, chocolate, cheese and gin. The UK also exports a huge amount of the meat it produces to the EU. The National Farmers' Union says 82% of UK beef exports go to the bloc. The UK sells 30% of its lamb overseas, most of which goes to the EU. In the EU, Ireland is the UK's biggest customer. It bought Â£4bn worth of food and drink from the UK in 2019 - although that was a 3.8% drop on the previous year. France bought Â£2.3bn worth of produce from Britain last year, a rise of 3.5%, while the Netherlands imported Â£1.7bn of UK goods, up 5.2%. France's decision to close its border to the UK left hundreds of lorry drivers stranded The UK found itself in the eye of a perfect storm: France shut its border to freight from the UK; winter means the UK is more reliant on the EU for fresh food; Britain will stop trading under EU rules on 31 December; some British ports are facing severe delays; the coronavirus has changed shopping habits and it is Christmas so demand is high. However, the UK's major supermarkets say they have plenty of supplies - following the coronavirus panic-buying earlier this year - and are encouraging people to ""shop as normal"". Tesco said: ""We've been building our stockholding of key products ahead of the Christmas peak and are working closely with our hauliers and suppliers to continue the supply of goods into our stores."" However, it did warn supplies of a few fresh items such as lettuce and citrus fruit might have been reduced ""later this week""-had an agreement not been reached. Sainsbury's said it was looking at alternative ways of sourcing products from Europe, a spokesman says: ""If nothing changes, we will start to see gaps over the coming days on lettuce, some salad leaves, cauliflowers, broccoli and citrus fruit, all of which are imported from the Continent at this time of year."" We'll always have cabbage: The UK grows its own greens We could - though there would certainly not be the variety consumers are used to. The National Farmers' Union says the UK imports 45% of its vegetables, the vast majority of which come from the EU. Britain also buys 84% of its fruit from overseas, although it is less dependent on the EU for these goods. However, Spain is the biggest supplier of fruit to the UK, accounting for 19% of imports. There are certain things we can grow here in the UK whatever the weather. For example, the UK produces 70% of cabbage and cauliflower supplies in January, rising to 90% in June. However, that appears to be more weighted towards cabbage at the moment given that Tesco and Sainsbury's have both warned that cauliflowers could be one of the vegetables affected by the disruption. Meanwhile, vegetables like rhubarb will always thrive here given that it likes damp cold soil. But if difficulties continue at the border with France, or a Brexit deal makes some produce more expensive to bring into the UK, then people may find themselves having to eat whatever is seasonal. No doubt, this will please some such as environmentalists as it means food will not have to travel as far, keeping a lid on emissions. However, it may not agree with everyone's palate.

"Kernowite has a distinctive dark green colour An ""amazing"" new type of mineral has been discovered by scientists analysing a rock mined in Cornwall about 220 years ago. The dark green mineral has been named kernowite after Kernow, the Cornish language word for Cornwall. A group led by Natural History Museum (NHM) mineralogist Mike Rumsey made the discovery while studying a rock taken from Wheal Gorland mine in St Day. Mr Rumsey said: ""It's amazing that in 2020 we are adding a new mineral."" For centuries, mineralogists believed the green crystals to be a variation of another mineral, liroconite, but Mr Rumsey and his team found it has a different chemical composition. Blue liroconite is highly prized by collectors around the world, and the majority of it comes from the Wheal Gorland site. The mineral was discovered within a rock specimen that has been at the Natural History Museum in London since 1964 Cornwall has a rich mining history with Unescoworld heritage status,externaland is known globally for the discovery of minerals. Mr Rumsey, principal curator of minerals at the NHM in London, said: ""A lot of these discoveries happened over 100 years ago when the mines were still active, so the discovery of a new mineral from Cornwall, particularly one that is related to the region's most famous mineral, is really quite amazing. ""Considering how many geologists, prospectors and collectors have scoured the county over the centuries in search of mineral treasure, it's amazing that in 2020 we are adding a new mineral."" Mike Rumsey is principal curator of minerals at the Natural History Museum, which has one of the most important collections in the world A new mineral is discovered in the UK every three or four years on average, according to the NHM The new description has now been approved by theInternational Mineralogical Association,externaland the new type will be published inMineralogical Magazine,externalnext year. Mr Rumsey said most liroconite comes from Wheal Gorland, adding: ""The mine was used between around 1790 and 1909, but it has been demolished now. ""There is a housing estate on it and there is nothing left. It's an extinct locality, we can never go back."" The mine where it was discovered has now been built over ""What we've got is a bit like a little time capsule,"" Mr Rumsey said. ""The fact that this sample was preserved in a museum means that we can do this kind of research because we'd never be able to go back and collect any more."" The structure of the crystals is the same as liroconite, but kernowite contains iron instead of aluminium, creating the different colour A mineral is naturally occurring chemical substance formed by geological processes A rock is an object formed of one, or many minerals in combination Many minerals form beautiful crystals, the most prized being those with bright colours, glass-like transparency and attractive crystal forms The gemstone minerals and their varieties, like diamonds, emeralds and rubies have been desirable since ancient times The Natural History Museum's mineral collection isone of the most important and comprehensive collections of its type in the world,external, containing about 185,000 specimens Cornwall lithium deposits 'globally significant' Israeli company unearths rare mineral Tourists pinch crystals at Iceland mine Natural History Museum Hallworthy Market Report: Thursday, January 9 Cornwall weather and traffic updates as another Met Office ice warning starts More Cornwall patients waited over an hour in ambulances last week than anywhere else in country Chef who turned life around after fire led to serious diagnosis makes appeal Award-winning Helston estate agent expands with second office in Cornwall Prominent councillor denies Cornwall Council car parks are being sold off At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"Police said they were investigating a report of an assault that took place in August at Cygnet Woodside A hospital for men with learning disabilities has been placed in special measures after there were ""serious risks to patient safety"". The Care Quality Commission (CQC) inspected Cygnet Woodside, in Bradford, in September following allegations of abuse by staff towards a patient. Police said they were investigating a report of an assault at the hospital on 31 August and had arrested two men. The mental health hospital said it was taking action to address improvements. Dr Kevin Cleary, CQC deputy chief inspector of hospitals and lead for mental health, said: ""Our latest inspection of Cygnet Woodside found that the hospital was not ensuring its patients' safety."" He said there were ""inherent risk factors and warning signs"" including a high turnover of employees and an inadequate number of skilled staff looking after patients, which compromised care. ""The service showed warning signs that increased the likelihood of a closed culture developing. This would have put people at serious risk of coming to harm if we didn't take action,"" he said. The CQC said senior leaders were not always fully aware of concerns in the service and ""this included the concern relating to the allegations of abuse toward a patient which is being investigated by police"". Following the unannounced inspection, the commission also suspended the nine-bed hospital's current ""good"" rating for caring. It has been given an overall rating of ""inadequate"" after a strong odour of urine, damaged walls and peeling paint on wards were also found. Cygnet Woodside said it was ""disappointed"" with the CQC's assessment, that their report was ""disproportionate"" and ""does not provide an entirely accurate representation"" of the hospital. A spokeswoman said it reported to police a ""single safeguarding concern that was raised against a member of staff"". The hospital ""immediately suspended two employees"", she added. Dr Cleary said there would be ""further action to keep people safe"" if inspectors saw insufficient improvement. West Yorkshire Police said the arrested men were subsequently released under investigation but did not disclose the offence they had been held under. Mencap, a learning disability charity, said the CQC report highlighted yet more concerns of inpatient units and called on the government for ""the right support and housing in the community"".

"130,000 people in Wales were asked to shield and isolate in the first Covid wave Those asked to shield against Covid during the first wave of the pandemic in Wales have been advised to avoid leaving home for work or school. About 130,000 people deemed extremely vulnerable due to underlying health conditions were originally advised to stay at home and isolate from others. Ministers halted shielding in August. Now a rise in casespossibly linked to a new variant of the virushas prompted the Welsh Government to tell those affected not to attend work or school. Health Minister Vaughan Gething wrote in a statement that the advice, which is effective immediately, was particularly relevant to those whose work required them to be in regular or sustained contact with people, or who shared a poorly ventilated workspace for long periods. Mr Gething wrote: ""This decision has been taken based on number of factors but has been influenced most recently by the significant recent growth in rates of infection, possibly due to the new variant of the coronavirus. ""We have also taken account of the pressures we see on our health service with increasing hospitalisations."" The 'terror' of returning to the outside world Isolation 'felt like parallel world' for young shielders Letters will be sent from the chief medical officer (CMO) and can be used as evidence to claim statutory sick pay. People shielding can still go out to exercise and attend medical appointments, and are able to remain part of a support bubble. Mr Gething added: ""We have been clear that the safest option for people within this group is not to be part of a Christmas bubble. ""However if they choose to do so they should follow the advice provided on ourwebsite,externalwhich includes keeping contacts to an absolute minimum, meeting for short periods in well ventilated areas, maintaining strict hand and surface hygiene and staying two metres away from others."" He acknowledged that letters informing people of the change were likely to be delayed because of the Christmas period. The Welsh Conservatives had urged the government to introduce ""a compassionate shielding process"", which would include food boxes, dedicated supermarket home delivery shopping slots and financial support for those who are unable to work. The Welsh Conservatives had called for new measures to help the most vulnerable to shield again The party's health spokesman, Andrew RT Davies, said: ""I'm pleased that the Welsh Government has thought about the most at risk in our communities however, today's announcement does not go far enough. ""What this pandemic has shown is that half measures are not good enough, especially when there are reports today that Wales has the highest rate of Covid-19 infections per 100,000 people in the world."" Plaid Cymru Member of the Senedd for Rhondda Leanne Wood said she welcomed the decision. ""I have had people in Rhondda Cynon Taf tell me they were put in a terrible position of having to choose between risking their lives in work or staying at home and facing poverty because they had no right to stay at home,"" she said.

"The changes apply to people buying second homes in Wales An increase in land transaction tax for second homes in Wales has begun with just a few hours' notice, causing ""chaos"" according to a solicitor. Second home-owners must nowpay an additional 4% levy when they buy properties up to Â£180,000,external, rising to 16% for homes worth at least Â£1.6m. But solicitors said they were ""dismayed"" at being given just hours' notice of the changes. The Welsh Government says they could help raise Â£13m for social housing. A spokeswoman added: ""As with any budget announcements, these changes were not shared in advance."" The Law Society says the changes only applying in Wales but not England may mean solicitors over the border handling purchases in Wales may not be aware until they do a final calculation upon completion. David Greene, president of the Law Society of England and Wales, said solicitors were dismayed when the changes were announced on Monday to come into effect on Tuesday, adding: ""These last-minute changes come at a time when solicitors are under enormous pressure."" In the village of Abersoch, Gwynedd, a beach hut can cost as much as an affordable home Property solicitors were already dealing with Wales adopting stricter lockdown measures and people seeking to move before the 31 March tax holiday deadline, Mr Greene said. They are dealing with ""record numbers of transactions, which are being hit by delays in searches"", he added. ""They now have clients who face paying thousands of pounds more if they are unable to proceed with their transaction within the very short notice period given."" Edward Friend, director of Carreg Law in Carmarthenshire, said five of his clients due to complete on Monday or Tuesday were affected - with some managing to do so before the tax hike came in and others now having to pay extra money they had not anticipated. ""It amounted to four working hours' notice, so yes it has been chaotic. Row over Welsh farming cash in Spending Review 'More flexible' funding needed to help Welsh firms Second homes tax 'loophole' worry Call for new law on national park second homes ""If you own a property and you buy another, it could be for your son or daughter or you're working somewhere, a holiday home or because you're separating - it catches you and you have to pay an increase. ""Yesterday we had transactions that were going to be completed yesterday and today, mirroring each other, and clients completing today are paying a significant amount more. ""A client completing yesterday saved about Â£2,500."" Mr Friend said his firm was now having to go through every file it has open, and inform clients they will have to pay more land tax than in the quote originally given. ""You tend to report how much it costs at the beginning so they're budgeting from the moment they put the offer in, the finances for a transaction take place a week before so they have to pay that difference on the spot. ""The reason it's chaotic is we have to go through the files we've opened and inform all the clients, and that's had to be done at the busiest time of the year."" Mr Friend added he had been contacted by firms in England asking for clarity. ""Every solicitor is unlikely to be aware, one English firm last night at 5:25 emailed me asking if their transactions are affected. It shows the pressure they are under. ""In my experience they've never been this last minute, they normally give you notice of the change."" Mr Friend added people who have exchanged but not yet completed are exempt from paying the extra tax - which he said was ""unfair and unjust"" as the exchange date is often beyond the client's control. The changes to land transaction tax are part of the Welsh Government budget The move comes as part of the Welsh Government's budget for 2021-22. Finance Minister Rebecca Evans said the budget would mean ""difficult choices"" as extra Covid-19 funding dries up. Opposition parties have said Wales needs a Covid-19 recovery plan. While Wales received an extra Â£5bn in funding from the UK government this year to deal with the pandemic, this will fall to Â£766m in 2021-2022.

"This video can not be played 1,500 lorries stuck in Kent as France remains closed The EU's executive branch, the European Commission, has called on member states to lift travel bans imposed against the UK amid fears of a new Covid strain. The non-binding recommendation was put forward ahead of a meeting of ambassadors from the 27-member bloc. But with EU countries free to set their own rules on border controls they may continue with their own policies. France and the UK meanwhile said they had reached an agreement to ease restrictions. New coronavirus variant: What do we know? How a dramatic week in the UK unfolded Tracking the global pandemic: Where has been hit hardest? At the weekend, France closed its borders to passengers and freight from the UK, causing disruption at the southern British port of Dover, an important gateway for goods entering and leaving the UK. Thousands of lorries have become stuck, prompting warnings of shortages over Christmas. Almost all the EU's 27 member states are currently blocking travellers from the UK. Keen to develop a common policy, after earlier in the year seeing members close shared borders, the EU has been holding emergency meetings. In a statement, the commission recommended its members allow people to travel to their country of residence providing they take a Covid-19 test or self-isolate. But it said non-essential travel should be discouraged. It also said transport staff in the EU, such as lorry drivers, should be exempt from travel restrictions and mandatory testing. This video can not be played 'Operation Brock' in place for lorry drivers On the UK, it said that should lorry drivers require Covid-19 tests to leave the UK for France and other EU countries, it ""should not lead to transport disruptions"". But as Tuesday came to a close there was little sign that the recommendation would be taken up. Some flights will resume on Wednesday for Belgian nationals returning home but Germany extended its ban. One diplomat told the AFP news agency that the ambassadors had simply ""taken note"" of the recommendation. The deal will allow the resumption of freight and some passenger services through the UK-French border. Lorry drivers and EU nationals will be able to travel but must show proof of a negative coronavirus test. Plane, boat and Eurostar train connections will resume on Wednesday. Since the border closure began nearly 3,000 lorries have been stuck in southern England and it is likely to take until Christmas for the situation to be resolved. The French restrictions have led to long queues forming in southern England The UK government is advising lorry drivers against travelling to the area until mass testing gets under way. Meanwhile, Japanese car giant Toyota said it had suspended production in two factories in the UK and one in France. It blamed ""shortages of parts due to transport delays and the uncertain nature of the duration of the border closures"". UK travellers don't just face restrictions in Europe - more than 50 countries around the world fromIndia, toIran, toCanadahave suspended flights from the UK. The USalready has restrictions in place that prevent most non-US citizens who have been in the UK and some other countries for the last 14 days from entering. It is yet to follow suit with a ban on all travellers from the UK, but two airlines - British Airways and Delta - will only allow passengers who test negative for the coronavirus to fly to New York's John F Kennedy airport. Saudi Arabia,KuwaitandOmanhave shut their borders completely to international passengers. Swedenbanned foreign travellers fromDenmarkovernight into Tuesday after cases were discovered there. The decision alarmed Danes - especially those on the island of Bornholm, which relies on a fast ferry link with Ystad in Sweden. There are fears that many will struggle to get to or from Bornholm in time for Christmas, Danish media report. Along with Denmark, the new strain has also been detected in Australia, Italy and the Netherlands. This video can not be played Mr Johnson said he understood the concerns of ""our international friends"" As the list of countries imposing travel restrictions on the UK grew, the World Health Organization's (WHO) Europe director, Hans Kluge, said member states would convene to discuss strategies and limit travel, while maintaining trade. The new strain is more transmissible but is not more deadly or resistant to vaccines, experts say. Some experts believe the new strain has already spread beyond where it has been reported, crediting the UK's use of genomic surveillance for detecting it. ""I think we will find in the coming days that a lot of other countries will find it,"" Marc Van Ranst, a virologist from the Rega Institute for Medical Research in Belgium, told broadcaster VRT. In another development, travellers from South Africa are also facing bars from some countries after another new variant of the virus was discovered that is unrelated to the one found in the UK.

"This video can not be played 1,500 lorries stuck in Kent as France remains closed France is starting to let traffic from the UK back in after the nations reached agreement over their shared border, closed amid concerns over a new coronavirus variant. Freight drivers and some passengers, including EU citizens, will be among those allowed to return - if they have a recent negative test for the virus. Some 2,850 lorries have been stuck in Kent since the border shut on Sunday. NHS Test and Trace staff and the military will be deployed for testing. Planes, boats and Eurostar trains are due to resume on Wednesday morning. Under the agreement between the two countries, admittance to France will be granted to those travelling for urgent reasons, including hauliers, French citizens, and British citizens with French residency. But in order to travel, they will need to have received a negative test result less than 72 hours before departure. 'We are tired, we are disappointed, we are scared' Life on the road for truckers amid ports chaos New variant could be circulating outside UK Rapid lateral flow tests, which can detect the new strain and give a result in about 30 minutes, will be used rather than the 24 hours required for so-called PCR tests. The drivers will receive the result by text message, and this message would give them the right to cross the Channel. A ""protocol is still being finalised"" to work out what to do with those drivers who test positive, a government source told the BBC. In an interview with broadcasters, Mr Shapps said enough tests had been sent to Kent to test all those who wanted to return by Christmas, but suggested it could take until Christmas for congestion to be relieved near ports. Mr Shapps warned hauliers against travelling to Kent until further notice to alleviate congestion at ports. He said: ""I am pleased that we have made this important progress with our French counterparts this evening. This protocol will see the French border reopen to those travelling for urgent reasons, provided they have a certified negative Covid test. ""We continue to urge hauliers not to travel to Kent until further notice as we work to alleviate congestion at ports."" The arrangement agreed with the French government will be reviewed on the 31 December, but could run until 6 January, the Department for Transport said. The French government will also carry out sample testing on incoming freight to the UK. A Romanian driver rests inside his lorry at Ashford International railway station truck stop The announcement comes after the EU Commissionurged member states to drop their travel bansto avoid supply chain disruption. More than 50 countries have banned UK arrivals following widespread concern about the spread of the new variant. No lorries have been leaving the Port of Dover or Eurotunnel to France. Kent County Council leader Roger Gough told the BBC on Tuesday afternoon that 2,220 vehicles were at the temporary lorry park at Manston, while 632 were still being held on the M20. It comes as Tesco said it would bereintroducing temporary purchasing limits on some essential products, including toilet rolls, eggs, rice and hand wash. The British Retail Consortium warned that trucks needed to be able to start travelling again in the next 24 hours to ""avoid seeing problems on our shelves"". Andrew Opie, its director of food and sustainability, told the Commons business, energy and industrial strategy committee: ""What we've been told by members is that unless those trucks can start travelling again and go back to Spain and Portugal and other parts of Europe, we will have problems with fresh produce from 27 December."" The Channel is a vital trade route, with about 10,000 lorries a day travelling between Dover and Calais at Christmas, largely bringing in the freshest produce. A further 36,804 people in the UK have tested positive for coronavirus and there were 691 deaths within 28 days of a positive test,according to Tuesday's government figures,external. It is the largest daily number of cases recorded yet, though it is thought the infection rate was higher during the first peak in spring when testing was much more limited. Meanwhile, truck drivers stranded in Kent have called for immediate help from the government, with hundreds facing a third night sleeping in their cabs. Truck driver Laszlo Baliga, 51, from London, spent Tuesday delivering food and water to those lined up at Manston Airport, a disused airfield. He began taking supplies after Hungarian drivers stranded in the lorry park posted on Facebook asking for help, with one telling him the only toilet on the site had been blocked. He said he and friends had so far spent more than Â£500 on food and water for drivers at the site. Mr Baliga said: ""We have got ready-to-eat sausages, bread, tomatoes, lettuce, coffee. Basic foods for now for the drivers. ""We like to help because this is a difficult time."" Ronald Schroeder, 52, from Hamburg in Germany, said: ""I am now staying in a hotel, but in front of the hotel there are thousands of people without any rooms waiting to come over the Channel crossing. ""I feel a little bit like Robinson Crusoe on an island."" The government defended the facilities for stranded drivers, saying there were ""more than adequate health and welfare provisions available"".

"This video can not be played Some drivers complained about unsanitary conditions and a lack of food Lorry drivers who have tested negative for coronavirus have begun boarding ferries at the port of Dover after France reopened its border with the UK. Some 3,800 lorries have been parked up in Kent after France closed its UK border on Sunday amid concern over a fast-spreading variant of the virus. France ended its ban on UK arrivals on Wednesday, on the condition that people were tested before travelling. Earlier, police clashed with drivers who have spent days in their cabs. Transport Secretary Grant Shappswarned there were ""severe delays"",externaland urged people to avoid travelling to Kent. Around 50 countries imposed a ban after the UK warned of anew, fast-spreading variant of coronavirus. 'We are tired, we are disappointed, we are scared' Life on the road for truckers amid ports chaos New variant could be circulating outside UK The French government's ban, introduced on Sunday, has now been eased toallow French citizens, British nationals living in France and hauliers to travel- if they test negative less than 72 hours before departure. Soldiers have joined NHS Test and Trace staff in Kent to carry out rapid tests on thousands of stranded lorry drivers. But Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said it could take ""a few days"" to clear the backlog. Lorry drivers will have to prove they have tested negative for coronavirus before travelling A number of drivers clashed with police this morning, with officers trying to push back a small crowd trying to enter the Port of Dover. Kent Police said one man is in custody after being arrested for obstructing a highway in Dover and there have been disturbances at Manston Airport, where a lorry-holding facility run by the Department for Transport is now full. The entrance to the Port of Dover is currently closed with a line of police officers blocking it, BBC reporter Amanda Akass said. They told her they will not start allowing vehicles through until ""protesters"" - several dozen drivers - move from the roundabout at the entrance. But the drivers have said they will not move as they do not want to go to the back of the queue and cannot move as the road is blocked in both directions. One driver told the BBC he is tired and does not have much food. ""We are very tired. We're staying in cars, we don't have a lot of food, no money,"" one driver told the BBC. ""Police three days ago told us that testing will start soon, but they don't know when and that's why people are protesting,"" another said. ""We just want to do the test and just go straight home."" Rod McKenzie of the Road Haulage Association described the situation as ""chaos"" as lorry drivers headed to ports thinking the borders would be open. ""They're tired, frustrated, desperately wanting to get home for Christmas,"" he said. He said the information given to them has been ""extremely poor"", while food provision, toilets and washing facilities were ""inadequate"". Richard Lloyd, director of a British firm that imports farm machinery from Poland, said he had been called by the family of a driver who was stuck without food, asking whether he could get a loaf of bread to the lorry. ""He didn't want to go anywhere because of the security of the truck, and obviously a place in the queue, so it was a desperate situation,"" Mr Lloyd said. The government says free food and water is being provided. A statement said there are 12 food trucks at Manston Airport and eight more arriving, and more than 200 toilets. It also said there are toilets stationed every kilometre between parts of the M20. ""We are working tirelessly to provide support to hauliers awaiting testing at Manston and the M20,"" it said. By Simon Jones, BBC reporter at the scene Frustrated lorry drivers have confronted the police as tensions over their continuing confinement threatened to boil over. Some hauliers marched out of the Manston lorry park, where they've been forced to sleep in their cabs, demanding to know when they'll be allowed to go home. There's a huge backlog of traffic to clear. Some hauliers said they'd been told the testing on the site was initially delayed because the tests got held up in traffic. Manston is now full - so there'll be some pressure on the authorities to get as many tests done as quickly as possible to clear space for any new arrivals. This video can not be played Aerial views of the thousands of lorries stuck in Kent since the border shut Eurotunnel said around around 700 cars, 50 vans and 20 trucks s have been able to cross the Channel since this morning, and a ""flow"" of trucks has arrived at the British terminal since 16:00 GMT. Roger Gough, leader of Kent County Council, told BBC Radio Kent that the ""most difficult"" challenge is clearing a route from Manston Airport to Dover, around 20 miles south, ""to be able to get those lorries onto the ferries"". ""Whilst we're able, for instance, to get some progress in terms of people travelling via the Eurotunnel, it's much harder to get vehicles to the port in the current situation,"" he said. ""The problem is also that - particularly for the non-HGV traffic, the families and so on - you have some really quite worrying welfare situations,"" he said. He added that the British authorities are in a ""race against time"" because the last ferry leaves on Christmas eve, and are trying to persuade the French to ""keep things running on the Calais side over Christmas day"". More than 5,000 lorries are being held in Kent, according to the Department for Transport. Officials have been going from lorry to lorry to provide tests. Home Secretary Priti Patel urged hauliers ""not to travel to Kent as we work to alleviate congestion"" as ""travelling now will slow things down"". ""Tourist travellers who are not French residents should not travel,"" she tweeted. The Port of Dover alsourged passengers not to turn up,externalwithout a negative coronavirus test. NHS Test and Trace staff have been going from vehicle to vehicle with tests at Dover. Mr Jenrick told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it is likely to take ""a few days"" to clear the backlog of lorries that have built up. He said there would be ""multiple testing sites"" at Manston Airport and elsewhere. Rapid ""lateral flow"" tests will be used, which can detect the new variant and work like a pregnancy test to give a result in about 30 minutes. Freight drivers will receive their test result by text, and a negative result gives them the right to cross the Channel. If they test positive they will be offered Covid-secure hotel accommodation nearby where they will have to self isolate. Testing will also take place on the French side for hauliers entering the UK.

The Road Haulage Association said: ""Even if the border is opened up, a short delay in the process is going to mean huge delays in the supply chain."" Normally, about 10,000 lorries a day travel between Dover and Calais at Christmas, largely bringing in the freshest produce. More than 50 other countries, including Germany, Italy, India and Pakistan, are continuing to block travellers from the UK. The Netherlands and Belgium have also now lifted their ban, but will only accept people if they have a recent negative result. The Netherlands has demanded UK arrivals use so-called PCR tests, which can take over 24 hours to turn around as they require a lab.

"Many of us have had to rip up our Christmas plans this year - and for some that means spending the festive period alone. We spoke to a couple of experts, a mental health charity and someone who spends Christmas on her own every year - and loves it - to find out what tips they would offer someone preparing to be on their own this Christmas Day. If you're really cross about your ruined plans, that's OK. ""We are in extraordinary circumstances and I think people have every right to be angry and disappointed and sad,"" says Helen Russell, journalist and author of the book How to be Sad. ""We have to acknowledge and give space and sit with that sadness,"" she says. ""Suppressing the negative thoughts doesn't work - they come back with a vengeance."" She says many people find change difficult, so don't worry if you feel unsettled. ""You may have been expecting a lovely big family Christmas, the picture-perfect Christmas, but unfortunately that's not going to happen,"" says Martha Mills, who spends Christmas on her own every year. She used to hate Christmas, but now can't wait to have the day to herself. She wrote a helpful thread of tips on Twitter. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. Accepting that this year's festive period will be different is key, she says. She suggests changing the way you look at the day: ""You can now rewrite the rules and plan something different."" Martha says she treats it as a ""decadent"" day of self-indulgence and self-care. So do what you like. And if there are events or traditions that you can't do this Christmas, it may help to think of them as paused rather than cancelled. Mind, the mental health charity, says ""postpone them until next year, even if they happen in the summer"". Don't wake up on Christmas Day not knowing what you are going to do. ""I have to hold myself back from planning too soon,"" Martha says. Planning the day out allows her to break it into bit-sized chunks. So plan what you are having for breakfast, set some time aside for reading, or a walk, or an afternoon film, or ringing relatives. ""Make sure you have some nice food in, have some people you know you can video call or just text, and make sure you have some sort of agenda for the day."" Mind also recommends taking some time to make your home feel nicer. ""This could be putting up Christmas decorations, or extra photographs."" It could be as simple as tidying up. And try to plan something nice to do after Christmas. ""Having something to look forward to next year could make a real difference,"" the charity says. 'I got dressed up even though I had nowhere to go' What are the new rules on mixing at Christmas? Can I meet family on Boxing Day? And other questions How to avoid catching Covid this Christmas Spend the day doing the things you enjoy. ""This could be taking a morning jog, playing video games or doing puzzles,"" the charity says. Equally it could be having a hot bath with a good book, or a lie-in wearing your favourite pyjamas. If you haven't got the pressures of travel or fitting in with other people, then you can simply focus on doing what makes you happy. Buy yourself a present or get something you've always wanted. And wrap it up to then unwrap later! ""Do what will make you feel good in terms of sensory things. I like to make sure I have a nice Christmas scented candle in. It is just being kind to yourself and being gentle with yourself,"" Martha says. If there are people you'd like to speak to, you could arrange to talk over the phone or via video call. Or you could watch a film together, or do a quiz. British comedian Sarah Millican hosts a Christmas day chat on Twitter each year, which anyone can join, Mind says. And if you are feeling isolated or down, try getting outside. Sophie Scott, professor of cognitive neuroscience at University College London, says getting outside, even if to only walk around the block, is ""one of the best things you can do for your brain and your mood"". Martha agrees. She says cheery cries of ""merry Christmas"" exchanged with strangers and dog walkers will help. If you love turkey - and can still get one from your local shop - then do it. If you hate the stuff, buy something else. There are no rules about what you should and shouldn't eat, so get in some food you can look forward to eating. ""Plan to enjoy your favourite food or drink,"" Mind says. It doesn't even have to be dinner. ""It could be a special breakfast or some interesting soft drinks. It could be a good excuse not to eat traditional Christmas food."" ""If you want to just have salad for lunch, or eat peanut butter out of the jar for breakfast, then do it,"" adds Martha. Of course, you may decide not to mark Christmas at all this year. You could treat it as if it's any other day. ""This may feel easier than trying to celebrate alone,"" Mind says. ""It's completely understandable if you feel this way"". If you decide to skip it, the charity says you could let others know your plan. Say you're happy to hear from them on Christmas Day but tell them ""they can also support you by treating it like any other day and not mentioning Christmas"". If you are planning to give gifts, exchange them in advance. And the charity advises staying off social media to avoid Christmassy posts, and trying to avoid adverts on TV or online. ""A lot of people get bogged down in thinking they are not going to enjoy it,"" Martha says. ""And that's OK."" It's important to realise Christmas Day is only one day - and it will quickly be over, she says. ""It is only 24 hours and it won't last forever. If you are having the worst day ever, you will go to bed that night and when you wake up Christmas Day will be over.""
