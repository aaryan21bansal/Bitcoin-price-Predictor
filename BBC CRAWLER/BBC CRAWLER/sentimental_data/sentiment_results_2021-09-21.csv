"The government is proposing to give all employees the right to request flexible working when they start new jobs, the BBC understands. A consultation is to be launched on the proposals this week. The plan would allow all UK employees to request a flexible working arrangement from their first day at a new employer. At the moment, workers have to wait until they have been in their role for six months. The proposals would also see bosses have to respond to requests for flexible working more quickly than the current maximum of three months. It would also force firms to explain why any requests were refused. It is understood that the consultation document will be published on Thursday by the Department for Business. It started examining a range of flexible working options in 2019, including working different or condensed hours, job sharing and remote working. Most workers do not expect full office return Working from home job adverts rise Jane Hutton, chief executive of the job search website Evenbreak, a social enterprise run by disabled people, said she welcomed the news. ""For employers, offering flexible working means they can access so much more talent and that really benefits the business as well. ""Before the pandemic there was a huge resistance for people working from home but the reality is they are just as productive if not more so - it's just a pity it took a global pandemic for employers to trust their employees."" Mary Doyle says the right to work from home would have made a huge difference to her earlier in her career Executive coach and disability equality trainer Mary Doyle said the right to request flexibility would help more employees. Previously she worked for 28 years in technology and working from home was not an option. Before the pandemic, she said that when it became more acceptable to work from home at a corporate level it still wasn't the preferred option. ""For it to be right rather than a privilege would have made a huge difference to me earlier in my career,"" she said. Stephen Warnham, head of content at UK jobs site Totaljobs.com, said the move pointed to ""a growth in a hybrid way of working"", where people are ""trusted to work in the way that best gets the job done"". ""If you consider the jobs market as it stands with all its vacancies, businesses listening to the needs and wants of employees is key."" As part of a survey of 200,000 staff worldwide, published in March this year, Totaljobs found that nine in 10 employees wanted partial flexibility to choose where they work. ""From a legislative perspective this is long overdue as a third of employers we speak to are already doing this anyway, so it is a really critical change,"" said Mr Warnham. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said that flexible working ""should be a right"" to everyone from their first day in the job. ""But these proposals won't be the game changer ministers claim, as employers can still turn down any or all requests for flexible working,"" she continued. ""The government should change the law so that workers have the legal right to flexible work from day one in the job - not just the right to ask for it."" And Angela Rayner MP, Labour's Deputy Leader and Shadow Secretary of State for the Future of Work, said: ""Labour will give workers the right to flexible working - not just the right to request it - and give all workers full rights from day one on the job."" Gill McAteer, head of employment law at Citation, said that if an employee contract said the place of work was the office, employees have no legal right to work remotely. ""Until this becomes a reality, employees will have to accept their employer's back to work plan or face challenging it through the existing flexible working process,"" she said. However, Ms McAteer said that while it was ""relatively easy"" for employers to refuse a work from home request before the pandemic, now it is ""more challenging"" as employees can demonstrate they have ""effectively"" carried out their role from home during the crisis. The potential repercussions of employers getting this wrong can be costly, Ms McAteer explained, referring to a recent tribunal decision to award Â£185,000 in damages to an estate agent who was denied a flexible working request to leave work earlier to collect her daughter from nursery.

"MPs are concerned that delays at Euston Station could lead to more costs There is ""no clear end in sight"" to HS2 costs and delays, MPs on the Public Accounts Committee have said. The committee is ""increasingly alarmed"" about key parts of the project, including a lack of progress at Euston Station. Without a government decision on the station, the project ""will literally run out of time"", the committee fears. The Department for Transport (DfT) said it was making significant progress delivering HS2. Euston Station is an important part of the first phase of the rail project, both as a London terminus and as a link to other infrastructure such as the London Underground. But the DfT ""is yet to make key decisions on the design and approach to construction there"" despite having the necessary planning consents. This could ""lead to yet more costs, delays and uncertainty over the promised benefits of the programme"", the committee said. HS2: Charges against '7 Sisters' tree protest in Buckinghamshire dropped HS2: Old Oak Common construction work begins Dame Meg Hillier, chair of the Public Accounts Committee, said: ""HS2 is already one of the single most expensive taxpayer-funded programmes in the UK but there's actually no clear end in sight in terms of the final cost, or even the final route. ""The project was plagued by a lack of planning and transparency from the start and there are many difficulties ahead. ""This project cannot simply keep sinking more taxpayer funds without greater clarity on the later phases. The development of Euston is a real challenge that must be resolved swiftly now."" The current estimated cost of completing HS2 is between Â£72bn and Â£98bn at 2019 prices, compared with an original budget of Â£55.7bn in 2015 at 2015 prices. The DfT said: ""We are making significant progress delivering HS2, a key part of our promise to build back better from Covid-19. An artist's impression of Birmingham Curzon Street HS2 station ""We will continue to rigorously control pressures, and as our latest update to Parliament confirmed, Phase One remains within budget and schedule."" The Integrated Rail Plan would soon outline how major rail projects, including HS2 Phase 2b, would work together to ""deliver the reliable train services that passengers across the North and Midlands need and deserve"", it added. HS2 Ltd, the firm behind the project, said: ""HS2 Phases One and 2a have received parliamentary approval and have very clear cost ranges. ""Although there have been challenges - particularly relating to the pandemic - the project remains on budget."" The company said the HS2 was supporting more than 20,000 jobs. The Public Accounts Committee has been critical of the rail project in the past, and in May 2020 said HS2 was ""badly off course"" and that bosses had been ""blindsided by contact with reality"". The committee accused HS2 Ltd and the DfT of lacking transparency and undermining public confidence. Following this criticism, the government was now providing ""a clearer explanation of costs than we have previously seen in its reporting to Parliament"", the MPs said on Wednesday. As tunnelling machines bore into the earth below the Chilterns, intense scrutiny of HS2 continues above ground. HS2's huge budget, environmental impact and community disruption are making lots of MPs and their constituents angry. But last week the government's high speed minister recommitted to the project ""going full steam ahead"". But there is still a major political issue for the government on HS2 - will it all get built? The prime minister still hasn't confirmed if the Eastern leg from the West Midlands to Leeds will happen, and Northern politicians are starting to express their frustration. Conservative and Labour MPs in Yorkshire see it as crucial for ""levelling-up"" the region, alongside other major rail investment they want too. But the government's cheque book is under pressure after a huge year of Covid spending. And with inflation rising and costs growing, we wait to see if the chancellor and prime minister push the button for it in full - or if HS2 will be slimmed down.

"The museum opened in 2011 Colchester's Firstsite art gallery has won the coveted Art Fund Museum of the Year award, 10 years after it opened. The Â£100,000 prize was presented to the Essex organisation's director Sally Shaw at a ceremony at London's Science Museum on Tuesday. The centre has been praised for its community work, such as offering free school meals to children in the holidays and sending out art packs. Art Fund director Jenny Waldman said it ""exceeded all our expectations"". She added that Firstsite was ""an outstanding example of innovation and integrity"". She explained: ""At their core is powerful, engaged contemporary art, housed in a gallery that gives space for everyone, from artists to NHS staff to local families and refugee groups. ""Here is a small organisation thinking big and caring for their local community. Here is excellence in Essex."" Works by NHS frontline workers went on display The gallery beat four other venues to the prestigious prize - Experience Barnsley, The Thackray Museum of Medicine in Leeds, Timespan in Helmsdale in the Scottish Highlands, and the Centre for Contemporary Art Derry-Londonderry. They each won Â£15,000 for making the final. Firstsite's recent exhibitions include a summer show called Welcome to Essex by Michael Landy, while the lockdown art packs were put together by 50 artists including Mark Wallinger and downloaded by almost 100,000 people. Shaw has previously said her art space is ""relentlessly inventive"". ""Everything should be constantly changing - it's an art gallery,"" she said. ""There's no rules. That goes from how we run our restaurant to the things that are in our shop to the difference we can make in a town like Colchester. It should be extraordinarily creative."" Speaking about the 8,500 free school meals they plated up, Shaw said that while ""it was bizarre for an art gallery to be doing that and part of me is really depressed by that... part of me is excited... because the people we meet now, many have never been to a gallery before"". More on Museum of the Year 2021 - BBC Arts Firstsite also showcased The Great Big Art Exhibition, which encouraged people to put their own art in their windows during lockdown; and Art for Life, an exhibition of work by frontline NHS workers. In response to Black Lives Matter, the gallery commissioned Essex artist Elsa James to make a downloadable work titled We Stand With You. It also worked with clients of Refugee Action Colchester for a collection titled My Name Is Not Refugee. Last year, the Art Fund shared the prize money equally between five museums due to the challenges faced by the pandemic. The Art Fund is the national fundraising charity for art, and provides millions of pounds every year to help museums to acquire and share works of art across the UK.

"Sharon Graham was elected Unite leader on a promise to take the union ""back to the workplace"" and spend less time on Westminster politics. She insisted that ""wasn't just an electoral chant"", and has argued that she was ""all about action"". But one of her earliest decisions is about not doing something. She is the first leader of Unite - Labour's biggest trade union funder - to decide not to attend the party's annual conference this weekend. It is in stark contrast to her predecessor Len McCluskey, who was an influential and ever-present figure in Labour circles. But she has told the BBC that her time can be better spent elsewhere. Unite union elects first female leader Party conferences: What to expect this year Starmer warned on planned leadership rule changes Ms Graham said: ""We shouldn't always do what we have always done just because we have always done it. ""I am days into my leadership - we currently have 16 industrial disputes going on, from Tesco drivers to  Weetabix to locksmiths in Scunthorpe and Wolverhampton. ""What I need to do is be with those workers in dispute and personally take leadership."" She denied she was snubbing Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, adding: ""We are in a crisis - workers are going to have a really rough ride. ""I am showing I am with them, and the Labour Party needs to do the same, and show it is with workers and communities too"". ""It's definitely not a snub - I have made a priority decision."" In fact, she met Sir Keir on Monday for an hour, describing the meeting as ""cordial"". But Ms Graham said he hadn't raised his proposed changes to Labour's leadership rules with her. The Labour leader is meeting representatives of key unions on Wednesday to discuss thatcontroversial move. She said the row over rule changes is like ""white noise"" to her members. And she gave the Labour leader the following advice: ""I made it really clear that I really want Labour to focus on the issues workers have - it has to be a continuous programme."" Sharon Graham said her decision not to go to the Labour Party conference was not a snub to Sir Keir Starmer The union gave Labour Â£3m in the run up to the last election, but party funding wasn't on the meeting's agenda. Ms Graham told me the union will continue to pay an affiliation fee to Labour, but she would want a lot more in return for optional donations. ""For those additional payments, it'd be wrong of us to say there is a blank cheque,"" she said. ""I have to be able to say, head held high, 'this money has gone into [opposing] fire and rehire' or 'this was put in to research and development'. It's about workers' issues. ""If Labour doesn't talk about that agenda, people are quite rightly going to question why we are giving those additional funds."" Ms Graham also confirmed her union delegates would vote to oust Labour's most senior official, general secretary David Evans if - as expected - Labour conference votes on whether to endorse him this weekend. He is carrying out a programme of voluntary redundancies at Labour's head office. She said: ""David Evans engaged in all essence in a fire and rehire practice - any CEO who did that would not get our support."" But a Labour spokesperson rejected the criticism, saying the party was undertaking a ""voluntary severance scheme"", which was ""nothing like fire and rehire"". Legal and general Unite under Len McCluskey financed a range of legal challenges against Labour when the party tried to discipline or expel left-wing members. If Ms Graham wanted to be involved in less intra-party wrangling, would that continue? She said: ""I am doing a review of every single area of the union, including legal. The most important thing about our legal services is whether they support the members. ""I will make decisions with the [union] executive. I don't know all the details [of the legal actions]. ""But on a broader level, my focus is jobs, pay and conditions of workers - therefore the resources of the union are going to be on that."" Former Unite leader Len McCluskey was heavily involved in the political side More generally, she would be reorganising the country's second largest union - bringing together members in each sector of industry. She intended to go through the books of big companies ""forensically"" if they attempted to cut pay and conditions, to find out if they were genuinely struggling or if they were using the Covid crisis to reduce her members' rights. And she will draw up a ""workers' manifesto"" that she will push with whoever is in power. Ms Graham said she resisted pressure on her to stand aside in the contest for her union's top job to give another left-winger a clear run. She described some of that pressure as ""toxic"" and ""vile"". She added: ""I have a 12-year-old son and I didn't think it was a good moral for him to capitulate. It made me more determined."" And now that she has succeeded, she is clearly just as determined to do things differently.

"Pen Farthing founded the charity A former Marine's mission to bring rescue animals back to the UK as the Taliban took over Afghanistan is being examined by the Charity Commission. The regulator has told the BBC it is looking into the funding arrangements of Operation Ark, which raised more than Â£200,000 from supporters in days. Operation Ark was launched by Pen Farthing's charity Nowzad to evacuate staff members and their immediate families, plus the animals in its care. The charity says it acted correctly. Nowzad, which reported income of close to Â£1m last year, told the BBC: ""The trustees are wholly confident that Nowzad's life-saving work in incredibly difficult circumstances was both the right and only thing to do and was absolutely in furtherance of the charity's purpose."" The Charity Commission has contacted Nowzad for further information after receiving reports around the governance and financial arrangements of Operation Ark. It is examining the use of charity funds for the evacuation and whether it is in line with the charity's purpose. ""We will assess the information provided by the trustees to determine whether or not there is a role for the Commission,"" it said in a statement provided to the BBC. Farthing tells of joy as rescue workers escape Pen Farthing through airport security with animals Minister offers help to get charity out of Kabul Leading charities lawyer Edwina Turner at Anthony Collins solicitors says this can be ""a crisis point"" in the life of a charity. ""It's very serious if the regulator gathers information from you. The charity will want to clear up any concerns,"" Mrs Turner said. ""One question they [Nowzad] would need an answer to is have they spent money raised in furtherance of their objects? Secondly, have they spent the money in the best way possible to achieve their charitable purposes. Thirdly, has the money raised through Operation Ark been spent in accordance with the terms of the fundraising campaign?"" Nowzad operated an animal clinic, dog and cat shelter and donkey sanctuary in Afghanistan. It trained and employed local Afghans - including women - as vets. As the Taliban takeover progressed last month it said its staff were in danger due to their work with foreign organisations, such as embassies, and ""the animals were at risk because the Taliban considers companion animals, particularly dogs, unclean."" Theformer Royal Marine and his supporters led a vociferous evacuation campaignwhich garnered a lot of public attention. It received huge public support but also came in for criticism, including from Defence Secretary Ben Wallace who complained it distracted from focusing on evacuating the most vulnerable. The charity says an ""extremely fraught but ultimately successful"" evacuation ensued. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

It says ""all staff and their families, including young children and two newborns, and 162 dogs and cats have been delivered to safety."" Nowzad confirmed the Charity Commission is asking for their trustees' comments on Operation Ark including, specifically, how it furthered the charity's purpose. ""The trustees of course recognise that it is entirely proper for the Commission to gather more information regarding this high-profile and unprecedented operation and are very happy to provide the information requested,"" it added. Nowzad is a registered charity in England and Wales and is regulated by the Charity Commission. At this stage, the Charity Commission has made clear they are gathering information and no findings have so far been made. According to Mrs Turner, the Charity Commission has a range of powers, including ""removing trustees, putting in an interim manager to run a charity or certain aspects of a charity"" or, in extreme circumstances, ""they can bring a charity to a close."" Mr Farthing, the founder of the animal shelter, who is originally from Dovercourt in Essex, is now working to find new homes in the UK for both his airlifted staff and rescued animals. He is also considering expanding his charity's work abroad, in countries he deems safer than Afghanistan, though he does not rule out a return to Kabul if conditions one day improve.

"This video can not be played ""This is a very important trip for us"": Boris Johnson and Joe Biden hold face-to-face talks Joe Biden has played down the chances of a post-Brexit free trade deal between the US and UK, as he held talks with Boris Johnson at the White House. The US president said he would discuss the issue ""a little bit"" with the UK prime minister, adding: ""We're going to have to work that through."" Downing Street said a direct deal with the US remained the ""priority"". But UK ministers are pondering joining an existing North American trade pact instead, the BBC understands. Mr Biden and Mr Johnson also discussed Northern Ireland, climate change and Afghanistan during the 90-minute meeting. The UK is keen to strike free trade deals around the world in the wake of leaving the European Union's single market - including with the US, with which annual trade was worthan estimated $273bn (Â£200bn),externalin 2019. A deal would encourage more business between the two countries by making it cheaper, usually by reducing or eliminating taxes called tariffs. How many trade deals has the UK done? BBC specialists on the prospects for UK-US trade Biden meets Boris: Shared interests but bumps remain Biden in new protocol warning over Northern Ireland But Mr Johnson, echoing Mr Biden, downplayed chances of securing agreement with the US before the next general election, saying: ""The Americans do negotiate very hard."" Environment Secretary George Eustice told Sky News: ""We still very much hope to be able to put together an agreement with the United States. We are not putting timescales on it."" ""It's just not a priority for the US administration,"" he added. Mr Johnson highlighted the decision to lift the ban on British beef, and Downing Street is increasingly confident that there could soon be a favourable decision lifting the export ban on lamb. Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office before the talks, Mr Biden said: ""We're going to talk a little bit about trade today and we're going to have to work that through."" He did not counter the assertion from his predecessor Barack Obama that the UK would have to join ""the back of the queue"" in seeking a trade deal after Brexit. It's really clear from both sides that there is no rapid path to a trade deal - the opportunity that used to be lauded by Brexiteers and by President Trump. Mr Johnson hinted at that realism in his curtain-raiser conversations on his way over here. And the president pretty much confirmed that in the meeting in the Oval Office. The UK seems no longer to want to believe, or pretend, that doing business in a major deal is top of their list. Instead, while the government is still officially pursuing a stand-alone deal with the US there's a twin track with a more incremental approach - there have already been changes to whisky tariffs and British beef. But No 10 is now hopeful that the Americans are seriously considering changing tack on British lamb. Read more from Laurahere. A source familiar with the government's thinking told the BBC the UK could negotiate entry into an existing trade arrangement between the US, Canada and Mexico - the USMCA - set up after former US President Donald Trump tore up its predecessor, NAFTA. ""There are a variety of different ways to do this,"" the source said. ""The question is whether the US administration is ready. The ball is in the US's court. It takes two to tango."" Joe Biden urges unity amid tensions with allies Hotdogs and hand-holding: The US-UK relationship history Elsewhere, Downing Street said Mr Johnson and Mr Biden agreed all diplomatic and humanitarian methods must be used to stop conditions getting worse in Afghanistan. The leaders said any international recognition of the Taliban must be contingent on the group respecting human rights. This followed arequest by the Taliban to address world leaders at the United Nations summitin New York this week. Brexit gave the UK the freedom to strike its own trade deals - and accounting for Â£1 in every Â£6 of British trade, a pact with the US was the ultimate prize. But Whitehall officials have for months been scrabbling for an alternative after the Biden administration indicated it was in no hurry to resume talks. Joining the USMCA arrangement already agreed by the US, Canada and Mexico could give the UK deeper benefits on some goods and digital trade with North American economies. But it has limited coverage of the UK's biggest strength when it comes to selling to America, namely services. Economists say the overall gains from joining USMCA may be very limited, perhaps less than 0.1% of GDP America's price of admission may include a hurdle already encountered: standards surrounding food and agricultural goods. For President Biden is explicit that his priority is US workers, not least its farmers. He is also clear that domestic issues take precedence. Even if the UK does want to sign up to USMCA, it may still be at the back of a queue - simply to get its application considered. Before the meeting, Mr Biden alsoissued a fresh warning to the UK that peace in Northern Ireland must not be jeopardisedas a result of complications caused by Brexit. He made it clear he had concerns about the Irish border, amid continuing issues withNorthern Ireland Protocol- the arrangement which helps prevent checks along the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The pair also discussed the newUK, US and Australia security pactin the Asia-Pacific region, with No 10 describing it as an example of ""shared values and approach to the world"". The meeting, taking place on the sidelines of the UN summit, involved the traditional exchange of gifts. Mr Biden gave the prime minister a framed photo of their first meeting in Cornwall at the G7 summit in June, and a White House-branded watch. Mr Johnson presented the president with a signed copy of a book written by British astronaut Tim Peake, with an inscription expressing hopes that it ""provides a reminder of what we're fighting to save as our countries tackle climate change together"". The prime minister's gift comes weeks ahead of the COP26 summit in Glasgow, which is seen as a crucial moment to bring climate change under control. Earlier, Mr Biden announced the US would double its climate finance pledge and increase funding for developing countries to $11.4bn (Â£8.3bn) by 2024. Mr Johnson said the US had ""stepped up to the plate"" with what he called a ""massive contribution"" towards the $100bn (Â£73bn) goal for countries to raise.

"Proposed changes to how Labour elects a future leader have been criticised as an attempt to 'deCorbynise' the party. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has re-opened a bitter internal dispute just days ahead of his party's conference. He has tried to convince trade unions to back a plan to scrap the leadership rules which enabled predecessor Jeremy Corbyn to get elected - but has so far failed to secure their support. Currently grassroots members elect the leader - a system introduced by Ed Miliband. But Sir Keir wants to return to an ""electoral college"", where ordinary Labour Party members would only account for a third of the votes in a future leadership contest. Party conferences: What to expect this year Unite union elects first female leader Labour rapidly losing members under Starmer - McDonnell MPs would be given a further third of the vote - a move backed by ""moderate"" members of the party as they believe elected politicians more closely reflect the views of constituents and not just activists. The unions would also be given a third of the vote. That may, on the surface, seem to appeal to the unions, but Labour politics is never that simple. Between them, the unions account for half the votes at Labour conference, so they will have huge influence over whether the leadership rules will change. Those under left-wing leadership see the proposed rule changes as an attempt to ""de-Corbynise"" the party - reintroducing rules which gave MPs too much say at the expense of the members. In her first broadcast interview, Sharon Graham - the new leader of the influential Unite union - said Sir Keir had not floated the idea with her in advance and should ""think again"". She told the BBC: ""People will remember that at their conference, Labour talked about rules not issues. That's a huge error for them. This video can not be played Sharon Graham says Labour should focus on ""issues facing workers and communities"" not the rules to elect a future leader. ""We are almost trying to save [the Labour leadership] from themselves. This is not the path to go down."" Ms Graham, who has written to Labour MPs urging them to oppose Sir Keir's position, argued: ""This proposal to reduce the membership to one third of the vote, while inflating the vote of Labour MPs, is unfair, undemocratic and a backwards step."" Labour MP Sam Tarry, who serves in Sir Keir's frontbench team as a shadow transport minister, tweeted that he ""cannot support a regressive plan to dilute Labour members' votes and divide our movement"", adding: ""We are one party and should all have an equal say in choosing who leads any Labour government."" The left-wing group Momentum condemned the move. Vice chair Callum Bell said: ""These rule changes would mark the start of a civil war in the party. Starmer holds the membership in contempt."" And former shadow chancellor John McDonnell, also on the left of Labour, criticised Sir Keir for concentrating on ""internal factional pursuits"" as the party meets in Brighton for its first face-to-face conference since Covid hit. But Labour MP Neil Coyle urged left-wingers to back the changes so that the party can improve its chances of winning power in the future, and get on with tackling issues voters cared about. ""We need to pick someone who can actually win for us and not another loser on an epic scale, like we had before,"" the Bermondsey and Old Southwark MP told the BBC's Politics Live. Ed Miliband - who introduced the system Sir Keir wants to overturn - said it was ""a leader's prerogative"" to make changes adding: ""I support his decision to do that."" ""Keir Starmer's intention is to get the Labour Party in touch with voters - that is the key thing."" On Wednesday, Sir Keir argued his case directly to the unions which affiliate to Labour but I have been told there were ""no takers"" for his plan to change the rules. A source told me the meeting was ""cordial"" and the Labour leader was in ""listening mode"" but the unions urged him to delay his plans so they could discuss them more widely with their members. A joint statement from Labour and Mike Whelan - chair of the Trade Union and Labour Party Liaison Organisation - said the meeting was ""positive"" and that discussions ""will continue"". Sir Keir added ""this was never a take it or leave it conversation... I am continuing to take suggestions and have discussions about how we do everything we need to in order to make the Labour Party the party of working people again."" But insiders tell me that very little preparation had been done, and that the Labour leader has no guaranteed support. For his plan to succeed he would need to win over three big unions - the GMB, shopworkers' union Usdaw and public service union Unison. If it is clear that too many unions are opposed to it, the proposal will not go to Labour's conference. If, however, two of those unions back him and another agrees to abstain, the proposal would go to Labour's National Executive Committee on Friday and then on to the full conference at the weekend. The proposals in some form will go to Labour's National Executive Committee (the party's ruling body) on Friday night - only then will a decision be taken on whether to risk a conference vote. Sir Keir has so far been seen as a cautious leader, but this would be a high-wire act, because he could be defeated either before conference or on the conference floor. But allies are praising him for leading from the front and hope his authority will be strengthened if he wins. I am told that he is willing to negotiate on the precise make-up of the electoral college and may be willing to give unions a bigger say in a leadership contest in order to get the proposal through. Ahead of Wednesday's meeting with the unions, Sir Keir said the current rules ""focus us inwards to spend too much time talking to and about ourselves"". ""I know that this is difficult - change always is - but I think these changes are vital for our party's future."" He added: ""I have said I will make the Labour Party the party of working people. I am determined that the Labour Party I lead focuses on the country, on the concerns of voters, so we need party reforms that better connect us with working people."" He will also propose to make it more difficult for local parties to oust - or deselect - MPs. Are voters ready to listen to Labour's Starmer?

"Nicola Sturgeon has urged venues to use ""common sense"" when checking vaccine passports, as she set out details of where and when they will be required. Major events and venues such as nightclubs will be expected to ensure that everyone present has had two doses of vaccine from the start of October. However spot-checks will be allowed at larger events, with organisers expected to do a ""reasonable number"" of checks. The first minister said the scheme will help reduce transmission of the virus. And she said it could encourage uptake of vaccines and help keep venues like nightclubs open for business. Some business leaders voiced concerns that the scheme ""goes well beyond what was initially proposed"" and could impact on hotels, pubs and other hospitality venues. Live: Nicola Sturgeon updates MSPs on Covid-19 plans Scotland to launch vaccine passports on 1 October What do we know about the vaccine passport? Ms Sturgeon told MSPs that Covid-19 cases had fallen in Scotland in recent weeks, but warned that ""the position remains fragile"" with the NHS under ""sustained pressure"". The government's vaccine certification scheme will come into force at 05:00 on 1 October, with people over the age of 18 required to show they have had both doses of vaccine before they will be allowed entry to: Nightclubs and adult entertainment venues Unseated indoor live events, with more than 500 people in the audience Unseated outdoor live events, with more than 4,000 people in the audience Any event, of any nature, which has more than 10,000 people in attendance Certificates will be displayed via an app, which will be available for download from 30 September, while venue staff will either scan this using another app or visually check the QR code shown, The government has drawn up a working definition of a ""nightclub"" as being a venue which is open between midnight and 05:00, serving alcohol, and which has a designated area for dancing and provides live or recorded music for this purpose. Ms Sturgeon said detailed guidance would be published, but said venues should use ""common sense"" over the scheme. She said a venue which has a dancefloor would not have to check people coming in for a pub lunch in the afternoon, but said ""it would be reasonable"" to check customers who arrive later in the evening. The first minister added: ""A pragmatic approach will be encouraged, so that businesses can make sensible judgements."" While clubs and smaller events will be expected to inspect the certificates of all customers, the organisers of larger events will have to carry out a ""reasonable number"" of checks. Aberdeen nightclub owner and spokesman for the Night Time Industries Association Scotland, Gavin Stevenson, toldBBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programmethe definition was still confusing. ""It is not a definition of just nightclubs because it includes about 2,000 pubs and bars across Scotland in addition to the 100 nightclubs that are actual nightclubs. ""It would be fair to say that it has not in any way been communicated well by the Scottish government with only nine days to go until this policy is implemented."" He added: ""Typically pubs would have opening hours up until about 01:00 and most of them would have some form of entertainment on at the weekends. This will also apply to lots of city centre circuit bars and to hotel function rooms with parties or events going on in them. ""These venues will now have to take on door staff to control entry when they would previously have had no requirement to do so under their existing licences. There is a critical shortage of door staff and it won't be possible to implement this by 1 October so we have raised our concerns with government on that basis that this is a fundamentally unworkable plan."" Football chiefs had saidspot-checks would be ""the only practical reality""when dealing with matches involving tens of thousands of fans, warning of lengthy queues and potential for disorder if every attendee was checked. Ms Sturgeon said there had been talks with football clubs and licensed trade organisations, saying their feedback had been ""very helpful"". The Scottish Chambers of Commerce was critical of the plans, with chief executive Liz Cameron claiming ""thousands"" of businesses would be caught up in the scheme. She said: ""We have made it clear that the practical application of what is being asked is not workable in the timelines being proposed. ""Scotland's economy remains fragile, and many businesses remain in survival mode - there is no doubt that vaccine certifications will serve as an economic detriment."" Opposition parties at Holyrood - which all voted against the plans butsaw them approvedby MSPs from the SNP-Green administration - also called for greater clarity about the plans. Scottish Conservative health spokesman Sandesh Gulhane said: ""The SNP government vaccine passport scheme comes into force next week, and the first minister is still finalising guidance and businesses are worried about the impact it will have on them. ""Despite promises of a reset, it is clear that jobs and businesses are still not the priority of this government."" Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said detail had been provided ""at long last"", but the government was still falling short. He said: ""There are still big gaps in the detail, still limited engagement with businesses affected, and limited evidence published of the difference it will make."" Mr Sarwar added that it was ""at best disingenuous"" to suggest the scheme is the same asone being set up in Wales, where people will have to provide either proof of vaccination or a recent negative test. Ms Sturgeon said the problem with the Welsh scheme was that it relied on self-reporting of test results, which she said was ""not the best approach"" and would not drive up the uptake rates of vaccines.

"Thousands of people have been evacuated from Afghanistan - but some of those left behind say they feel ""betrayed"" UK nationals and former interpreters stranded after British forces pulled out of Afghanistan have told the BBC they feel abandoned. Now hundreds are fearing for their safety following a UK government data breach. Ahmad, not his real name, is in hiding in Afghanistan. He is one of more than 250 Afghan interpreters and local staff whose names and some profile pictures were mistakenly shared ina Ministry of Defence data breach. He is eligible for relocation under the UK government's Afghan Relocation and Assistance Policy (Arap) but he is still in the country. When Ahmad received the MoD email he says he initially ""felt good"". ""I thought, they're still chasing our cases."" Then he realised the error. The email addresses and names of all the recipients could be seen by everyone on the email. Many of those who got the email, like Ahmad, remain in hiding, fearful their lives could be in danger. The government has apologised to those affected and aninvestigation has been launched. But Ahmad says the error could put him in danger. ""I'm sure that it will have a negative impact on our safety"", he says. ""We are already displaced from our home town."" Defence secretary angered over Afghan data breach MoD shared 250 Afghan interpreters' details on email Ahmad was shot by the Taliban while on patrol as an interpreter with British troops in Helmand, in 2011. Before the airport in Kabul closed last month, officials told him to take his family there to be evacuated. But the crush to get on flights was too much for his baby daughter. Left behind in Kabul, he now lives apart from his wife and child to try to keep them from danger. ""I feel betrayed and we feel left behind,"" he says. ""We were the people deserving to be relocated."" ""I am living from place-to-place, going door-to-door. It is very difficult for me financially and from the security perspective - and also mentally."" ""Just when you think it can't get worse than this, along comes [the email],"" he told the BBC. Since mid-August, when the Afghan government fell, the UK says more than 15,000 people have been evacuated from Afghanistan. The BBC understands this includes more than 8,000 UK nationals, while a few hundred more have made it out under their own steam. Two flights out of Kabul to Doha in the past week have carried a further 26 British nationals and four Afghan spouses. Officials will not say how many British citizens have still to make it out of the country but chat among the community left behind in Afghanistan gives a sense of the scale of the problem facing Liz Truss, the UK's new foreign secretary. Ziad travelled to Afghanistan in July and says other UK nationals are stuck there ""There are loads of people waiting,"" says Ziad, who travelled from Newport to Afghanistan in July to visit his sick mother. His name has been changed to protect his identity. ""My cousin is also a British citizen, he's also waiting. Lots of my school mates are here as well. My driving instructor, he's stuck here as well. So imagine how many more would be here."" The government says it has advised against travel to Afghanistan for many years. But those who did make the trip and are now stuck feel abandoned. ""They are not serious about their citizens,"" Ziad says. ""Until now, I did not receive any help."" He is not alone. Life under Taliban rule one month on Veteran's joy at seeing Afghan interpreter in UK Stay home, female Kabul government workers told Earlier this month, BBC News reported on a seven-month-old baby left behind in Afghanistan because of a delay in processing her passport. Three weeks later, her family in London say they are still waiting for news about what can be done to help them. Zahra, not her real name, told the BBC about her fears for her family in Afghanistan whose details she had registered with the UK government for assistance. She says they still have not had any good news. Her family is now making plans to travel to a third country. Sayyid, also not his real name, said he was worried about his brother who had previously worked for a British charity in Afghanistan because he had been threatened by the Taliban. This week he updated the BBC to say that his brother remained in hiding. Mujeeb Ashraf, a former interpreter for UK forces, might appear to be one of the lucky ones. After getting confirmation he was eligible for relocation under Arap, he managed to get himself on a commercial flight out of Kabul before the airport closed. He took the flight rather than wait for the UK to evacuate him. Now in Dubai, Mujeeb has sent repeated pleas to officials about what to do next but says he has so far not had any information about relocation to the UK. Mujeeb Ashraf, a former interpreter for UK forces, in currently stuck in Dubai ""It seems they have no plan for third countries,"" he says. ""Every day I'm checking my email to have some good news from the UK government. I don't know what to do next and I have no idea where to go."" With only handouts from voluntary groups to get by, and having to pay around Â£300 a month in rent to share a small house with 21 people, Mujeeb fears for what will happen after his visa expires. He pleaded with the UK government to ""help those people who helped you in your operations"". The BBC asked the government how it intended to help evacuate people like Mujeeb who are stranded in third countries. A spokesperson said they could not comment on individual cases but work was under way to support the logistics of relocation of those accepted as eligible who are already in third countries. Where possible, the government would contact those identified for relocation who are not yet in the UK, the spokesperson added. A government spokesperson said: ""The UK's evacuation operation helped over 15,000 people to safety including British nationals, Afghan interpreters, and other vulnerable people. ""Whilst the success of that operation exceeded our assumptions, we know that there are many left in difficult circumstances."" The spokesperson said the government's ""utmost priority is to continue to work with allies and partners in the region to ensure safe passage for those who want to leave Afghanistan"".

"This video can not be played Watch: President Biden's first UN General Assembly speech In his first address to the United Nations, US President Joe Biden has urged global cooperation through ""a decisive decade for our world"". His calls for unity come amid tensions with allies over the US' Afghanistan withdrawal and a major diplomatic row with France over a submarine deal. The US also announced it was doubling its climate finance pledge by 2024. Reaffirming his support for democracy and diplomacy, Mr Biden said: ""We must work together like never before."" The 76th General Assembly in New York City takes place against the backdrop of a climate crisis and a once-in-a-century pandemic, both of which have sharpened global divides. Mr Biden pushed for cooperation on these fronts, saying: ""Whether we choose to fight for our shared future or not will reverberate for generations to come. Simply put, we stand, in my view, at an inflection point in history."" Mr Biden on Tuesday stressed that the US is ""not seeking a new Cold War or a world divided into rigid blocs"". The US, he said, ""is ready to work with any nation that steps up and pursues peaceful resolution to shared challenges, even if we have intense disagreements in other areas"". The remark appeared to be a response to UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, who this weekend warned the US and China were headed for ""a Cold War that would be different from the past one, and probably more dangerous and more difficult to manage"". The president also touted the pullout from Afghanistan, which has been criticised by allies at home and abroad, saying the US was ending a ""period of relentless war"" for a ""new era of relentless diplomacy"". Mr Biden offered a key pledge on climate finance as well, saying the US will increase funding for developing countries to $11.4bn (Â£8.3bn) by 2024. This means the US will offer just over half of the European Union's pledge to help poorer nations cope with climate change. Has climate pledge to poor countries been met? The developed world had pledged to provide these countries $100bn a year by 2020 but this has still not been achieved. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson - who is meeting with Mr Biden later on Tuesday - praised the ""massive contribution"" and said the US had ""stepped up to the plate"". At the end of his first address, Mr Biden promised that the US would lead ""with our allies"". ""We will lead on all the greatest challenges of our time, from Covid to climate, human dignity and human rights, but we will not go it alone,"" he said. World leaders at odds with former President Donald Trump had hoped for a more stable and reliable America under his successor's leadership - but Mr Biden's most recent foreign policy moves have made some uneasy. The US' lack of coordination during the Afghanistan exit after two decades of war rankled allies and led to an international scramble to evacuate. The Nato mission at the time of the withdrawal comprised troops from 36 countries, three-quarters of whom were non-American. How Europe's relationship with Joe Biden turned sour Last week, a trilateral US-UK deal to provide Australia with nuclear-powered submarines infuriated the French, who had their own five-year-old contract to build conventional submarines for the Australians. French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian described the agreement as ""a stab in the back"", and the top French diplomats in both countries were recalled. The Biden administration has also seen international criticism over alleged US hoarding of Covid-19 vaccines and non-reciprocal travel restrictions, as well as frugality with climate aid. After four years of America First and Donald Trump's isolationist nationalism, this was a speech the leaders of the liberal democracies wanted to cheer. But Joe Biden's first appearance before the UN General Assembly will be treated with a good deal of scepticism after America's shambolic departure from Afghanistan. That said, the US president was determined to push his more outward looking view of the world. And turning a page, he was able to say this was the first time in 20 years that America wasn't at war. British diplomats will have cheered his pledge to double to $11.4bn the money to tackle climate change by 2024 - something they have been lobbying the White House relentlessly on. One issue that enjoys bipartisan support in Washington is the threat posed by China - the driving force behind the new security partnership with Britain and Australia. He didn't mention the world's other superpower by name, but it's clear who he was talking about. The US president has had a torrid, horrid summer. This speech was an attempt to reassure America's international allies - and to put flesh on the bones of his claim that ""America is back"".

"French firm Sorare, which sells football trading cards in the form of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), has raised $680m (Â£498m). The NFT-based cards are used by fans to create fantasy football teams which can then ""play"" each other. The funding was led by tech investor Softbank, with ex-England international Rio Ferdinand also putting in money. NFTs are controversial, with concerns over financial risk and environmental impact. An NFT is a ""one-of-a-kind"" digital asset that can be bought and sold like any other piece of property. As with crypto-currency, a record of who owns what is stored on a shared ledger known as the blockchain and maintained by thousands of computers around the world. What are NFTs and why are some worth millions? OpenSea admits insider trading of NFTs Fake Banksy NFT sold through artist's website Players can buy cards from Sorare at auctions, or fans can also auction cards they own to other players. Sorare claims $150m worth of cards have been traded on the platform since January. The latest investment puts its value at $4.3bn (Â£3.15bn). As NFTs, the cards can also be sold on platforms such as OpenSea and Rarible. Sorare says it has partnerships with more than 180 football clubs and has 600,000 registered users. A number of players including Spain's Gerard Pique and France's Antoine Griezmann also invested in the company. The firm recently announced a deal with Spain's La Liga and told the Telegraph it hoped to have ""something to announce"" about the Premier League. Some journalists, charities and fan organisations have begun to question if crypto-assets and sports mix. Sorare isn't the only business to have deals with clubs featuring crypto-based assets. Clubs such as Barcelona, Juventus, Manchester City and Paris St-Germain already have arrangements with a firm called Socios to sell crypto-currency-based fan-tokens. The firm promotes tokens on its website as a way to ""influence decisions of your favourite teams, unlock VIP rewards and access to exclusive promotions, games, chat & a superfan recognition"". But because the tokens can be traded, some fan organisations worry clubs are encouraging speculation in crypto-currencies. Leeds United Supporters' Trust, for example,was critical,externalof the club's decision to reach an agreement with Socios saying fans would be entering a ""crypto-currency ecosystem, something which many may have very little knowledge of"". ""If football chooses to bring unregulated crypto-currency into the game, we believe that clubs also need to provide education and guidance on the purpose and risks associated."" NFTs are also controversial. Depending on the technology used, maintaining a blockchain requires considerable computing power with a sizeable carbon footprint. As in traditional investing, financial impropriety and crime are a risk, but the protections for consumers are generally less robust. There are also concerns about a lack of regulation. Recently OpenSea, the largest digital collectable marketplace, revealed an employee used inside knowledge to buy NFTs before they were promoted on the website. CEO Devin Finzer said the incident was ""incredibly disappointing"" and did not represent the team's values. Insider trading - where individuals use non-public knowledge about a company for financial advantage - is illegal in most regulated markets. But the NFT market does not have such restrictions.

"This video can not be played Tim Davie: ""I think we've got a real battle on our hands, I walk a tightrope every day on this, but we've got to fight for it."" It is harder than ever for the BBC to maintain impartiality amid the ""culture wars"" and a polarisation of online views, its director general has said. The corporation has ""done it pretty well for 99 years"" and still is, Tim Davie has told a committee of MPs. ""I just think it's tougher now, by the way,"" he said on Tuesday. ""I think the culture wars are raging, I think we've got a real battle on our hands. ""I walk a tightrope every day on this, but we've got to fight for it."" Impartiality is ""sacrosanct"", said Mr Davie, whose headaches over the issue since taking over a year ago have ranged from ruling onwhether Newsnight's Emily Maitlis should have shared a tweet from Piers Morganabout the government's response to the pandemic, towhether staff can attend Pride marches. The BBC is ""nothing if it's not a good facilitator of proper open debate and diverse views"", he told the House of Commons media select committee. ""I think that's essential to us. It's mission critical. It's us, and it puts you in a very different place to where the rest of the world is heading in my view, which is a dangerous place around partial media. ""I and others feel very passionately about this. We're in a battle for this, and I think we need to really be clear that we're not perfect. We've got plenty of work to do to facilitate a space where we can properly debate these issues."" He said the BBC must hire people from across the political spectrum, even if they know they must leave their personal views at the door. The hearing came after the appointment of former HuffPost UK editorJess Brammar to a senior role in BBC News, despite a row over old tweets that were critical of Brexit and the government. BBC director of newsFran Unsworth announced her resignationshortly before Ms Brammar was appointed executive editor of BBC news channels, but Mr Davie said her decision to leave had ""nothing to do with the latest incident"". He added: ""I just saw a senior hire in [BBC] online going to someone from The Daily Telegraph. We need to hire the best as the BBC and we need to hire across the political spectrum."" Referring to the choice of Ms Brammar, he said: ""That is an incredibly important precedent and this affair is dangerous territory for us, not because of the process, but if people begin doubting our ability to hire people with [political] views into the BBC, and when they get here they leave them at the door."" Mr Davie also warned that the corporation was losing stars in a ""red hot"" battle with rivals and streaming services. ""We're in an incredibly inflationary market,"" he said. ""And we have lost people. Graham Norton has gone to Virgin Radio, and we've lost people to GB News, to LBC and other places. They're being poached."" Michaela Coel won an Emmy Award for her BBC drama I May Destroy You on Sunday He also referred to Fleabag creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge, whosigned an exclusive deal with Amazon Prime. Michaela Coel, however,has spoken about rejecting $1m (Â£730,000) from Netflixfor her acclaimed drama I May Destroy You because the BBC offered her more creative control. ""Life is not just about money,"" Mr Davie said. ""It's also about the creative experience you get. It's about making Normal People, it's about making something wonderful in drama or some of the documentaries [and] that ability to actually be on BBC One and have a big audience. ""So I wouldn't be too depressed about it. Having said that, I think, over time, there will be increasing pressure on us."" Mr Davie was also asked about former BBC correspondent Martin Bashir, whowas found to have acted ""deceitfully""to gain his 1995 interview with Princess Diana. That scandal has also put the spotlight on his other work, including an investigation into the 1986 murders of two girls. Michelle Hadaway, the mother of one of the victims, has said Bashir took her daughter Karen's clothesbut did not do the promised DNA testing or return the clothing. Martin Bashir has told BBC bosses he doesn't know what happened to the clothes ""We are extremely sorry for the distress this has caused Ms Hadaway,"" Mr Davie said. ""It's very distressing that we haven't been able to give her answers in terms of what happened to that clothing, and I'm appalled that that got lost. It's a very serious issue."" BBC sorry over loss of murdered girl's clothes A new attempt to find them has not yielded results, he said. ""With a slightly heavy heart, we're at a point where we are where we are, which is the clothingâ¦ and we have talked directly to Martin Bashir rather than through any agent. ""He doesn't know where the clothes are. I didn't speak to himâ¦ but he just doesn't know where the clothes are. Any other evidence coming to us, of course, we will proactively look at.""

More than 100 military personnel are set to come to the aid of the Scottish Ambulance Service. The UK government said 114 drivers and support staff would be deployed in Scotland from Saturday, along with a further 111 to operate mobile testing units. ""Our armed forces are once again stepping up, demonstrating their versatility as we support the Covid-19 response across the UK,"" said Defence Secretary Ben Wallace. ""We are proud to work alongside the dedicated men and women at the Scottish Ambulance Service as they continue to provide a lifesaving service to the people of Scotland.""

Yousaf also announced a boost of Â£20 million to the ambulance service budget. Read more here. We're closing the live page soon - but before we go, here is a re-cap of the main coronavirus developments this Tuesday:  Vaccine uptake has slowed dramatically since the summer as figures show. On Monday - which saw the start of vaccinations for 12-15-year-olds in England and Scotland - 24,684 first jabs were given and 46,451 second doses were administered across the UK. Meanwhile daily deaths are rising - 203 deaths were recorded on Tuesday. Case numbers, though, are still falling, despite schools returning in both England and Wales at the start of this month. As we mentioned earlier, the firsthealthy 12 to 15-year-olds in England and Scotland began receiving Covid jabsthis week. Invites are also being sent out in Wales this week, while in Northern Ireland teen vaccinations are likely to start in October. Across the UK pupils this age are being offered a single Pfizer dose to help limit further disruption to their education. Most will receive the jab in a school setting. Evidence suggests a single dose cuts the risk of catching the Delta variant by about 55%. So will pupils still be encouraged to take lateral flow tests at home - and what happens if they test positive? And what about face coverings, social distancing and ventilation of school buildings? Everything you need to knowis here. Passes will be compulsory for those aged over 18 to enter certain events. Covid passes should be approved by the Senedd before they become compulsory, say opposition parties in Wales. From 11 October, people attending big events and nightclubs in Wales must show they are fully vaccinated or have tested negative in the previous 48 hours. The Welsh government has the powers to change the law, but the Conservatives and Plaid Cymru say Members of the Senedd (MSs) should get a vote first. Conservative shadow health minister Russell George said the Welsh government should make sure there is ""a vote in the Senedd prior to any proposed introduction and that the full details are given to members"". Plaid Cymru said it had ""consistently argued that coronavirus regulations should be agreed in the Senedd before coming into force"". Read morehere. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent There were fears September would see cases start to take
off. The return of more normal mixing patterns with schools back
and people going into the office would â some predicted â lead to a new surge. We are now two-thirds of the way through the month and the
opposite has happened â cases have fallen. Dig beneath the headline figures and there is a little more
volatility, Scotland has seen a rapid rise, but that appears to have peaked. This is now translating to falling numbers in hospital
overall â a trend which is likely to continue for the rest of the month. Deaths are averaging close to 150 a day. That may seem a
lot, but it is worth pointing out that it is similar to what you would see for
months on end during a bad flu winter. The big question now though is what happens next as the
nights draw in. There is uncertainty, but the longer cases remain in check
the more hope it gives us that UK has truly reached an equilibrium whereby the
amount of immunity built up through vaccination and natural infection is enough
to keep the virus at bay while society returns to normal. A young offender institution is declaring itself a Covid-19 ""outbreak site"" after""a high number"" of inmates tested positive for the virus. HMYOI Aylesbury, in Buckinghamshire, houses boys and men aged between 17 and 21. In a tweet it says it has ""restricted the regime"" on one wing ""as Covid has returned to the prison"". An HM Prison Service spokesman says precautionary measures are being taken at the institution in line with public health guidance. HMYOI Aylesbury says on Twitter: ""Unfortunately we have had to restrict the regime on one of our wings as Covid has returned to the prison with a high number of prisoners testing positive. ""We are now classed as an outbreak site. ""We are sorry for any impact this has on you and your loved ones as we try to contain the virus."" A further 203 deaths, among people who tested positive  for coronavirus over the past 28 days, have been reported in the UK, according tothe government's latest figures,external. In addition, 31,564 new cases were reported in the past 24 hours. In his first address to the United Nations, and against the backdrop of a once-in-a-century pandemic, US President Joe Bidenpledges cooperation with allies through ""a decisive decade for our world"". ""I believe we must work together like never before,"" he says. In the context of Covid and the growing climate crisis - both of which have sharpened global divides - Biden pushes for cooperation, saying: ""Our own success is bound up in others succeeding as well."" The 76th General Assembly in New York City is currently taking place. While the UK government announced last week plans to scrap PCR tests for returning, fully-jabbed, international travellers to England, Wales' first minister saysthis is a ""step away"" from a duty to people's health. Mark Drakeford says ministers in Wales face a ""difficult decision"" - with the nation not yet having decided whether to follow England. He says the tests allow scientists to detect new variants of the virus. From 1 October, for travellers to England, PCR tests will no longer be required on day two and this will be replaced instead by a cheaper lateral flow test. Concerns have also beenraised in Scotlandabout the change to the testing regime. Drakeford says the ""most concerning"" decision is moving away from PCR tests on day two, ""because that was the strongest defence against the re-importation of viruses from elsewhere in the world"". ""In Wales we genomic sequence a higher proportion of tests than any other part of the United Kingdom and it is that sequencing that allows the very skilled scientists who do it to identify new variations in coronavirus,"" he says. However the fact that many Welsh travellers travel to the UK via England made it a ""difficult decision"", with English ports not keen to communicate differences in rules. Simon Clarke, Conservative MP and chief secretary to the Treasury,  has defended the government decision to end the Covid Universal Credit uplift. The Â£20-a-weekincrease in Universal Credit is due to end in October,but many have criticised the government move at a time when prices and bills are rising for most households. ""All the evidence now points to a rebounding Labour market,"" Clarke tells the House of Commons. He refers to ONS figures last week ""which reported that [job] vacancies were at a record high"", adding that the unemployment rate fallen for seven consecutive months. ""People have been coming off the furlough scheme very rapidly now. Numbers are down from 5.1 million in January to 1.6 million at the end of July."" ""The furlough scheme has been absolutely essential to supporting the UK throughout this very difficult period. It has been an historic success."" But he adds: ""Broader economic growth has exceeded expectations as restrictions have been lifted."" And concludes: ""The best way to help vulnerable people is to provide them with the opportunities that they need for well-paid work."" Nadine with her brother Ash Cooper and her sister Victoria Cooper, the last time they were all together in 2019 Nadine Beasley, from Bournemouth, is one of those who have been waiting to visit her family in the US. Despite the change in travel rules she is going to miss her sisterâs wedding, for which she is maid of honour, by days. However, she will be reunited with her family at Christmas. ""My sister is getting married on 30 October in
California,"" she says. ""I was meant to be her maid of honour, my daughter a flowergirl. ""We
were due to fly out on 22 October, so we're naturally upset about the ban being
lifted in November, because we'll miss her wedding by days. ""However, we've now made our fourth rebooking since February
2020 to fly out on 20 December. So that means Christmas with my parents and my
siblings, who are all in California, which is better than the last 18 months of
waiting and knowing nothing."" With the travel ban she has not seen her siblings or parents for more than two years. She says it is annoying that she will miss her sister's wedding by days, having already missed her brother's but says the fact there is ""light at the end of the tunnel"" in the form of a date means it feels like ""a weightâs been lifted"". ""Weâre going with my nan. Itâs bittersweet because we lost
grandad,"" she adds. The UK government has borrowed record-breaking amounts to pay for measures designed to limit the impact of coronavirus. Government initiatives such as the furlough scheme are estimated to have cost up to Â£70bn by the time they come to an end on 30 September. And sadly it turns out there's no such thing as a magic money tree. So how much exactly has the government borrowed over the course of the pandemic, who has it borrowed from - and when does it have to be paid back? Find out here. This video can not be played What does a billion pounds actually look like? People downloading the NHS app is spurring hundreds of thousands to register their organ donation preference. More than 16 million people have now downloaded the app, with more than 12 million in England doing so since 17 May when the Covid Pass feature to prove vaccination for events and foreign travel was added to it. Some 1.5 million people have now registered their organ donation decision through the platform, with 265,000 of those doing it via the app for the first time, according to the Department of Health and Social Care. Around 150,000 people registered their preference from May. It comes after a new ""opt-out"" organ donation system came into effect last year, known as Max and Keira's law.
The law is named after Keira Ball, who died aged nine in 2017, and Max Johnson, now aged 13, who was saved by her heart. The US will let fully vaccinated travellers from the UK - and many other countries - visit from November. The change in rules, follows a shake-up of England's travel regulations on Friday. Put simply, going overseas is becoming a little bit easier, although, as before, different rules apply for the devolved nations. So where and when can you go, what are the rules around vaccination - and what's happening with the so-called traffic light system which saw countries divided into red, amber and green categories? We have all the answershere.  Katherine SmithBBC News In England 59,000
pupils (0.7%) were absent from school in England at the end of last week
with a confirmed case of Covid, according to the latest Department for
Education attendance figures. A further 45,000 (0.5%) were absent due
to a suspected case. Some 2,000 pupils were absent due to
restrictions in place to manage a Covid outbreak. Fewer than 500 were absent
due to Covid-related school closures. At the end of last term in July, when
bubble systems were in place, more than a million children were absent for
Covid-related reasons. Those figures included 774,000 who were isolating due to
contact with a positive case in school and 81,000 who had a confirmed or
suspected case. A police photo shows the takeaway stash seized by officers New Zealand police have made a bizarre arrest after a pair of alleged gang associates were caught trying to enter Auckland with a boot full of Kentucky Fried Chicken - and tens of thousands of dollars. Under Auckland's strict Level 4 lockdown, all restaurants - including take-away services - remain closed. Police said the men, aged 23 and 30, had travelled from Hamilton, about 75 miles south of Auckland. A police spokesperson told the BBC that officers made the arrest after they noticed a suspicious-looking vehicle travelling on a gravel road on the outskirts of the city. After a chase, the vehicle was stopped and searched. Police located NZ$100,000 (US$70,000; Â£51,000) in cash, as well as at least three buckets of chicken, about 10 cups of coleslaw, a large pack of fries, and four large bags containing other KFC items. The spokesperson said that the men would appear in court for breaching public health rules later in the year - but added that further charges are also likely. The investigation is ongoing. Under New Zealand's tough anti-Covid laws, fines can reach up to NZ$4,000 and can even involve prison sentences of up to six months. Auckland will move to a Level 3 lockdown from midnight on Tuesday, but residents will remain confined to their homes unless they are attending school, work or shopping. As mask wearing on public transport continues to decline, transport unions have expressed concern that it would be difficult to
reintroduce the policy if the government decided to do so. Mike Lynch, general secretary of the RMT union said his
members had noticed a marked policy drift since the government changed the
rules in July. Even where mask wearing remains mandatory, many people were ignoring the rules, he said. He added: ""As more people see others failing to comply, the situation will escalate quickly over the autumn."" ""With the government already making compulsory
mask wearing on transport a contingency if cases escalate in the coming weeks,
there is a real danger they won't be able to get the genie back into the
bottle."" Mick Whelan, general secretary of train driversâ union Aslef, agreed there had been ""a decline, in recent days"" even where mask-wearing is ostensibly required. âWe believe mask wearing should be mandatory on
trains.To protect
passengers and staff and to control the Covid-19 pandemic."" A spokesperson for Unite. which represents bus drivers, said mask wearing was ""collapsing - and has got much worse in
recent weeks"". âIn some cases there are very few passengers wearing masks on a bus, with those
who tend to still wear a mask being older."" Unions are warning that mask wearing on public transport has dropped significantly since it no longer became a legal requirement in England in July. The proportion of people using face coverings at major railway stations is estimated to have slumped from around 80% to around 20%. A government spokesperson said the lifting of restrictions relied on people taking ""personal responsibility"". ""The guidance is clear that people are expected and recommended to wear a mask when they come into contact with people they donât normally meet in enclosed and crowded spaces. âIt is open to transport operators to decide if they want to implement their own policies, working within their particular environment.â Transport for London (TfL), in keeping with many other operators, still require members of the public to wear a mask when travelling. âCovid is still with us and we all have a role to play in doing the right thing and keeping each other safe,"" said Siwan Hayward, Director of Policing and Compliance for TfL ""Wearing a face covering on our services and in our stations is still required under TfLâs condition of carriage,"" she said. She added that ""more than 500 uniformed officers"" were enforcing mask wearing on the network and ""non-exempt customers who fail to comply may be refused travel"".  Â© 2025 BBC.

The US will let fully vaccinated travellers from the UK - and many other countries - visit from November. The change in rules, follows a shake-up of England's travel regulations on Friday. Put simply, going overseas is becoming a little bit easier, although, as before, different rules apply for the devolved nations. So where and when can you go, what are the rules around vaccination - and what's happening with the so-called traffic light system which saw countries divided into red, amber and green categories? We have all the answershere.  Katherine SmithBBC News In England 59,000
pupils (0.7%) were absent from school in England at the end of last week
with a confirmed case of Covid, according to the latest Department for
Education attendance figures. A further 45,000 (0.5%) were absent due
to a suspected case. Some 2,000 pupils were absent due to
restrictions in place to manage a Covid outbreak. Fewer than 500 were absent
due to Covid-related school closures. At the end of last term in July, when
bubble systems were in place, more than a million children were absent for
Covid-related reasons. Those figures included 774,000 who were isolating due to
contact with a positive case in school and 81,000 who had a confirmed or
suspected case. A police photo shows the takeaway stash seized by officers New Zealand police have made a bizarre arrest after a pair of alleged gang associates were caught trying to enter Auckland with a boot full of Kentucky Fried Chicken - and tens of thousands of dollars. Under Auckland's strict Level 4 lockdown, all restaurants - including take-away services - remain closed. Police said the men, aged 23 and 30, had travelled from Hamilton, about 75 miles south of Auckland. A police spokesperson told the BBC that officers made the arrest after they noticed a suspicious-looking vehicle travelling on a gravel road on the outskirts of the city. After a chase, the vehicle was stopped and searched. Police located NZ$100,000 (US$70,000; Â£51,000) in cash, as well as at least three buckets of chicken, about 10 cups of coleslaw, a large pack of fries, and four large bags containing other KFC items. The spokesperson said that the men would appear in court for breaching public health rules later in the year - but added that further charges are also likely. The investigation is ongoing. Under New Zealand's tough anti-Covid laws, fines can reach up to NZ$4,000 and can even involve prison sentences of up to six months. Auckland will move to a Level 3 lockdown from midnight on Tuesday, but residents will remain confined to their homes unless they are attending school, work or shopping. As mask wearing on public transport continues to decline, transport unions have expressed concern that it would be difficult to
reintroduce the policy if the government decided to do so. Mike Lynch, general secretary of the RMT union said his
members had noticed a marked policy drift since the government changed the
rules in July. Even where mask wearing remains mandatory, many people were ignoring the rules, he said. He added: ""As more people see others failing to comply, the situation will escalate quickly over the autumn."" ""With the government already making compulsory
mask wearing on transport a contingency if cases escalate in the coming weeks,
there is a real danger they won't be able to get the genie back into the
bottle."" Mick Whelan, general secretary of train driversâ union Aslef, agreed there had been ""a decline, in recent days"" even where mask-wearing is ostensibly required. âWe believe mask wearing should be mandatory on
trains.To protect
passengers and staff and to control the Covid-19 pandemic."" A spokesperson for Unite. which represents bus drivers, said mask wearing was ""collapsing - and has got much worse in
recent weeks"". âIn some cases there are very few passengers wearing masks on a bus, with those
who tend to still wear a mask being older."" Unions are warning that mask wearing on public transport has dropped significantly since it no longer became a legal requirement in England in July. The proportion of people using face coverings at major railway stations is estimated to have slumped from around 80% to around 20%. A government spokesperson said the lifting of restrictions relied on people taking ""personal responsibility"". ""The guidance is clear that people are expected and recommended to wear a mask when they come into contact with people they donât normally meet in enclosed and crowded spaces. âIt is open to transport operators to decide if they want to implement their own policies, working within their particular environment.â Transport for London (TfL), in keeping with many other operators, still require members of the public to wear a mask when travelling. âCovid is still with us and we all have a role to play in doing the right thing and keeping each other safe,"" said Siwan Hayward, Director of Policing and Compliance for TfL ""Wearing a face covering on our services and in our stations is still required under TfLâs condition of carriage,"" she said. She added that ""more than 500 uniformed officers"" were enforcing mask wearing on the network and ""non-exempt customers who fail to comply may be refused travel"".  Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Watch: President Biden's first UN General Assembly speech In his first address to the United Nations, US President Joe Biden has urged global cooperation through ""a decisive decade for our world"". His calls for unity come amid tensions with allies over the US' Afghanistan withdrawal and a major diplomatic row with France over a submarine deal. The US also announced it was doubling its climate finance pledge by 2024. Reaffirming his support for democracy and diplomacy, Mr Biden said: ""We must work together like never before."" The 76th General Assembly in New York City takes place against the backdrop of a climate crisis and a once-in-a-century pandemic, both of which have sharpened global divides. Mr Biden pushed for cooperation on these fronts, saying: ""Whether we choose to fight for our shared future or not will reverberate for generations to come. Simply put, we stand, in my view, at an inflection point in history."" Mr Biden on Tuesday stressed that the US is ""not seeking a new Cold War or a world divided into rigid blocs"". The US, he said, ""is ready to work with any nation that steps up and pursues peaceful resolution to shared challenges, even if we have intense disagreements in other areas"". The remark appeared to be a response to UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, who this weekend warned the US and China were headed for ""a Cold War that would be different from the past one, and probably more dangerous and more difficult to manage"". The president also touted the pullout from Afghanistan, which has been criticised by allies at home and abroad, saying the US was ending a ""period of relentless war"" for a ""new era of relentless diplomacy"". Mr Biden offered a key pledge on climate finance as well, saying the US will increase funding for developing countries to $11.4bn (Â£8.3bn) by 2024. This means the US will offer just over half of the European Union's pledge to help poorer nations cope with climate change. Has climate pledge to poor countries been met? The developed world had pledged to provide these countries $100bn a year by 2020 but this has still not been achieved. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson - who is meeting with Mr Biden later on Tuesday - praised the ""massive contribution"" and said the US had ""stepped up to the plate"". At the end of his first address, Mr Biden promised that the US would lead ""with our allies"". ""We will lead on all the greatest challenges of our time, from Covid to climate, human dignity and human rights, but we will not go it alone,"" he said. World leaders at odds with former President Donald Trump had hoped for a more stable and reliable America under his successor's leadership - but Mr Biden's most recent foreign policy moves have made some uneasy. The US' lack of coordination during the Afghanistan exit after two decades of war rankled allies and led to an international scramble to evacuate. The Nato mission at the time of the withdrawal comprised troops from 36 countries, three-quarters of whom were non-American. How Europe's relationship with Joe Biden turned sour Last week, a trilateral US-UK deal to provide Australia with nuclear-powered submarines infuriated the French, who had their own five-year-old contract to build conventional submarines for the Australians. French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian described the agreement as ""a stab in the back"", and the top French diplomats in both countries were recalled. The Biden administration has also seen international criticism over alleged US hoarding of Covid-19 vaccines and non-reciprocal travel restrictions, as well as frugality with climate aid. After four years of America First and Donald Trump's isolationist nationalism, this was a speech the leaders of the liberal democracies wanted to cheer. But Joe Biden's first appearance before the UN General Assembly will be treated with a good deal of scepticism after America's shambolic departure from Afghanistan. That said, the US president was determined to push his more outward looking view of the world. And turning a page, he was able to say this was the first time in 20 years that America wasn't at war. British diplomats will have cheered his pledge to double to $11.4bn the money to tackle climate change by 2024 - something they have been lobbying the White House relentlessly on. One issue that enjoys bipartisan support in Washington is the threat posed by China - the driving force behind the new security partnership with Britain and Australia. He didn't mention the world's other superpower by name, but it's clear who he was talking about. The US president has had a torrid, horrid summer. This speech was an attempt to reassure America's international allies - and to put flesh on the bones of his claim that ""America is back"".

"The price of CO2 used to produce food and drink will be five times higher, under a deal to restart production. But there will be no ""significant impact"" on prices in supermarkets, the government says. Food grade CO2 is used for hundreds of products: to carbonate water, soft drinks and alcoholic drinks to dispense drinks and beers in pubs to promote the growth of plants - such as cucumbers - in greenhouses to stun pigs and chickens before slaughter for packaging meats, baby foods, fresh foods and baked products (CO2 extends shelf life by preventing bacteria) to keep food fresh in transport (CO2 is used in the form of dry ice and snow) Source: Food and Drink Federation/Global Counsel CF Industries produces CO2 as a by-product of its main product, fertiliser. Its two main plants, on Teesside and in Cheshire, had stopped work because of rises in wholesale gas prices. Because the fertiliser factories stopped working, there had been a cut of 60% of the UK's food-grade carbon dioxide supply. Why are gas prices rising and what if my supplier goes bust? Is the UK headed for a gas shortage this winter? It will meet the full operating costs - said to be tens of millions of pounds - of CF Industries' plant on Teesside for three weeks ""whilst the CO2 market adapts to global prices"". There will be a cap to the overall cost. As part of the deal, the food industry will have to pay five times more for carbon dioxide - with prices rising from Â£200 per tonne to Â£1,000. Environment Secretary George Eustice said the increased cost of CO2 wouldnot have a ""significant impact"" on prices. He said that while food prices were increasing because of issues including oil prices and labour shortages, carbon dioxide was ""a tiny proportion"" of overall costs. The CO2 issue has caused a ""big supply issue"", one supermarket executive told the BBC. Grocery delivery firm Ocadowarned it had ""limited stock"" of some frozen items. The Food and Drink Federation said with shoppers were likely to notice shortages in poultry, pork and bakery products. The British Retail Consortium welcomed payments to restart CO2 production, but saidtimings for the resumption of supplies would ""still be tight"". Remaining UK carbon dioxide production is being prioritised for medical uses. It is used during some invasive surgeries to stabilise body cavities, to stimulate breathing and to get rid of warts and moles. CO2 is also used by the nuclear industry as a coolant. The Timesreported,externalthat ministers were concerned that six reactors might have to close because of the supply problems. CO2 is also used commercially in fire extinguishers, for inflating life rafts and life jackets, and as a liquid solvent. Yes there was - caused by a usual summer drop in production, and a heatwave which increased demand for drinks and frozen products. At room temperature, carbon dioxide is a colourless, odourless gas. In the Earth's atmosphere, increased levels of CO2 contribute to global warming. It is naturally produced when: humans and animals breathe during combustion (for example petrol and diesel in cars) things ferment or decompose Its molecules have one carbon and two oxygen atoms, which is why its chemical formula is CO2.

"The cost of protecting customers from failing energy providers could lead to higher bills, the boss of the energy regulator Ofgem has told the BBC. It comes as energy firm Green said it was on the brink of collapse due to soaring wholesale gas prices. ""As underlying costs rise, pressure on bills does go up"", Jonathan Brearley, Ofgem chief executive said. The government has said it is looking at lending money to bigger firms to help them take on stranded customers. If an energy firm collapses, customers are automatically switched to a tariff provided by the new supplier. This is a tariff agreed with the regulator Ofgem, but it may well be more expensive than the deal they had with the former company which went bust. Mr Brearley said protecting customers of failed energy firms was the regulator's ""number one priority"". However, he said it was too early to predict how expensive it would be to ensure that they were transferred to other suppliers in an orderly way. Peter McGirr, founder and chief executive of Green, told the BBC it had appointed a restructuring firm in an attempt to survive the current crisis. Mr McGirr said the firm was in ""deep, deep trouble and our heads are unlikely to bob back to the surface"". Is the UK headed for a gas shortage this winter? What happens if my energy supplier goes bust? Why are gas prices rising? Green has 180 staff based in Newcastle upon Tyne and has 250,000 UK customers. Mr McGirr said the appointment of Alvarez and Marsal was currently on an ""advisory and restructuring"" basis, but admitted Green could fall into administration within weeks. ""We need to try to hold on long enough to get some support"", he added. The company has been in discussions with the government and energy regulator Ofgem, but has not been offered any support. Mr McGirr said he believed the larger energy suppliers had too much influence in the crisis talks being held with government and said the big companies had an interest in more of the smaller suppliers going to the wall. Asked whether these costs would be met by the taxpayer, or spread across all energy customers' bills, he said: ""We have to first of all make sure that customers are transferred and looked after and then as we see the market evolve we will understand better the cost implications."" Customers on some tariffs are protected from sudden hikes in wholesale gas prices through the energy price cap, which limits how much firms can charge per unit of gas. The price cap covers 15 million households across England, Wales and Scotland. Mr Brearley said it was too early to predict how much the energy price cap would rise next year. So far, four energy firms have gone to the wall, including People's Energy and Utility Point, and four more are expected to follow in the coming days. Industry sources fear there may be as few as 10 energy suppliers left by the end of the year, down from 70 in January. But Mr Brearley predicted that a number of small suppliers would survive the current crisis, as well as larger ones, maintaining a diverse market with plenty of choice for consumers. When asked if Ofgem was ""asleep at the wheel"" and should have prevented suppliers from making promises to customers which they wouldn't be able to keep if prices rose, Mr Brearley replied: ""No - we have always protected customers interests and we work very closely with the companies. ""We work closely with all companies to assess their financial position. And if they need to exit the market we have well-rehearsed systems and processes to manage that."" Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng earlier denied that failed energy companies would get government bailouts, saying: ""I do not think it's the right thing for taxpayers' money to be injected into companies that have been badly run."" However, he said the government was exploring the possibility of lending money to bigger energy firms to help them absorb the cost of taking on new customers from companies that had gone bust. ""If we do have this policy, they will be expected to pay back the loans,"" he added. Mr Kwarteng alsowarned many UK households could face a ""very difficult winter"",with fuel prices surging and the Â£20-a-week temporary uplift in universal credit due to end in October. How could the CO2 shortage hit food supplies? Farmers fear gas price crisis may spark pig cull The government and Ofgem have both dismissed suggestions that the cap on energy prices would be lifted ahead of an agreed 12% rise in October, saying that keeping it was the ""clear and agreed position"". The price cap is reviewed twice a year. It applies only to standard variable or default tariffs. These types of tariff are typically the most expensive plan that a supplier offers. When fixed energy deals expire, as they generally do after one or two years, customers are likely to be put on these tariffs. Customers will still continue to receive gas or electricity even if the energy supplier goes bust. Ofgem will move your account to a new supplier, but it may take a few weeks. Your new supplier should then contact you to explain what is happening with your account While you wait to hear from your new supplier: check your current balance and - if possible - download any bills; take a photo of your meter reading If you pay by direct debit, there is no need to cancel it straight away, Citizens Advice says. Wait until your new account is set up before you cancel it If you are in credit, your money is protected and you'll be paid back. If you were in debt to the old supplier, you'll still have to pay the money back to your new supplier instead Read more about the next best steps to take here. Mr Brearley said the industry had seen ""an unprecedented rise in gas prices"". ""They are almost four times what they normally are and that would put any industry under strain,"" he added. The government and Ofgem say the UK does not have gas supply problems because of a diverse range of sources ""that can more than meet demand"". However, energy bills are facing particular pressures in Great Britain because of a dip in renewable energy supplies due to low wind, as well as the outage of a power cable supplying electricity from France. The International Energy Agency has called on Russia to supply more gas to Europe, saying ""it could do more to increase gas availability to Europe and ensure storage is filled to adequate levels"", in preparation for the winter. It added: ""Based on the available information, Russia is fulfilling its long-term contracts with European counterparts - but its exports to Europe are down from their 2019 level. ""This is also an opportunity for Russia to underscore its credentials as a reliable supplier to the European market."" Stacey Stothard is waiting to see how much more she will have to pay Stacey Stothard followed all the advice. Aware that energy prices were rising, she shopped around to find a decent fixed deal for her gas and electricity. She saved Â£300 - or so she thought. Her new energy supplier went bust and now she will be switched automatically to another one, and she is facing much higher bills, potentially amounting to hundreds of pounds more a year. ""It is just like watching the meter go up and up,"" she says. ""I did the right thing - not going for the cheapest deal, but choosing a company with a decent customer service record.""

"Pig farmers fear they may soon have to start killing their animals because of a carbon dioxide shortage at abattoirs caused by soaring gas prices. CO2 is widely used in the food and drinks industry, including for stunning animals at abattoirs before slaughter. But some CO2 suppliers have halted production due to rising energy costs, creating a huge backlog of pigs that at some point will have to be killed. A food and drink trade body says the UK might need to subsidise CO2 production. Farmer Kate Morgan told the BBC on Monday ""thousands of pigs are backlogged on farms. If we can't kill our pigs in an abattoir, then unfortunately we will be resorting to killing them on farms"". Carbon dioxide used by the meat industry is aby-product of fertiliser production. The gas is also used to keep food fresh as well as in dry ice and fizzy drinks. CF Industries, the US-based business which produces about 60% of the UK's food grade CO2,has suspended production at two UK fertiliser plants. Norwegian firm Yara has also cut production at a number of European factories. Ms Morgan, who runs a pig farm near Driffield, east Yorkshire,told BBC 5 Live's Wake up to Money programmethe situation for the industry was already ""pretty dire"" because of labour shortages. Now, meat shortages at supermarkets are a real possibility, she said. ""Abattoirs have about a week's supply of gas. It's a chain: We have constantly got pigs coming out of the breeding herd that need to go in homes. Those homes need to be emptied."" Gas firms seek help amid higher energy bill fears Why are gas prices rising and what if my supplier goes bust? How could the CO2 shortage hit food supplies? Her farm sends about 1,500 pigs each week to abattoirs. Killing her own animals is not something she can bear thinking about. ""I can't even begin to think how we would do it. I don't want to put people who work for us in that situation,"" Ms Morgan said. On-farm killing means the meat is not something that would be able to enter the food supply chain. ""It would be wasted,"" she said. It is estimated there are about 100,000 pigs left on farms that would otherwise have been sent for slaughter, with the backlog having started building up weeks ago because of staff shortages. Andrew Saunders, a director at the UK's biggest pig producer, Pilgrims Pride, said there is no alternative to stunning with CO2. ""It is an essential part of the process,"" he told the BBC. Mr Saunders, also chairman of the British Meat Processor Association, said: ""80% of pigs in the UK are slaughtered in about 10 abattoirs, and those abattoirs all use CO2 stunning systems. We already face some challenges regarding keeping those abattoirs operational - some shortage of labour in those plants."" He said pigs can be kept on farms for only ""a very short period of time. They go beyond their target slaughter weight, they're then unsuitable for size of packets we have for our customers"". He added: ""We hope the government can turn around to intervene to get these CO2 plants up and running again. The particular plants in question supply about 60% of all UK needs and something's required here to get this going pretty quickly."" It is not just the pig industry facing problems, however. On Monday, the Food and Drink Federation (FDF) warned the whole sector faces disruption. In a letter to Environment Secretary George Eustice, the FDF's chief executive, Ian Wright, said: ""Important parts of the food and drink supply chain - already under significant pressure from the impacts of labour shortages, particularly HGV drivers - are now seriously compromised by disruptions in the supply of CO2. ""Across industry, there is a united view that the situation is worsening with little prospect of additional CO2 supply unless the UK government intervenes."" If ministers are considering financial help to support the energy sector, Mr Wright said then ""any subsidies made available must also be considered for the manufacturers of fertiliser to ensure there is no further deterioration across the UK food and drink supply, and production can be restored"". There are worries that food and drink shortages are starting to appear on supermarket shelves, with the problem expected to worsen in the run-up to Christmas without action. Richard Walker, managing director of Iceland, said his supermarket is building up stocks and while there is no immediate shortage problem, he told the BBC the CO2 situation needed to be sorted quickly. ""The thing that has shocked me is that 60% of [CO2] production is concentrated in two factories which are both owned by a foreign business. ""This is something that's clearly critical to national security - not just food but also healthcare as well. So it seems quite perplexing that it's at the whim of a private enterprise in terms of whether it's profitable or not and therefore whether they produce the stuff or not."" The British Soft Drinks Association said if manufacturers could not get hold of CO2 supplies, ""after their reserves have run out, production of certain products will have to cease"". Tony Will, chief executive of CF Industries, has held talks with the government over production at its two fertiliser plants, but the outcome is not clear. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng tweeted that he had met Mr Will and ""discussed the pressures the business is facing and explored possible ways forward to secure vital supplies, including to our food and energy industries"". Wholesale prices for gas have surged 250% since January, with a 70% rise since August alone, leading to calls for support from the industry and the collapse of some smaller energy firms. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who is in New York for a UN General Assembly meeting, said the problem with wholesale prices was ""temporary"". He added that he was ""very confident"" in the UK's supply chains and that market forces should be ""very, very swift"" in fixing the issues but that government would help where it could. A statement from the government said: ""We continue to monitor supplies across critical sectors and are in regular contact with industry on their CO2 supplies. ""The UK benefits from having a diverse range of gas supply sources and we have sufficient capacity to more than meet demand. We do not expect gas supply emergencies this winter.""

"This video can not be played Ben Wallace says processes for correspondence have been ""changed"" after this ""unacceptable level of service"" Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has said it would be an understatement to say he was angered by a data breach involving the email addresses of dozens of Afghan interpreters who worked for UK forces. More than 250 people seeking relocation to the UK - many of whom are in hiding - were mistakenly copied into an email. Mr Wallace has apologised to them, and launched an investigation. One person has been suspended, he said. The MoD has also referred itself to the Information Commissioner's Office. Speaking in the Commons, Mr Wallace said: ""I apologise to those Afghans affected by this data breach and with Home (the Home Office) we are now working with them to provide security advice. ""It is an unacceptable level of service that has let down the thousands of members of the armed forces and veterans. ""On behalf of the Ministry of Defence, I apologise."" He added that armed forces minister James Heappey was in the region speaking to neighbouring states to see what more could be done. 'Betrayed': The Afghans who feel left behind Life under Taliban rule one month on Veteran's joy at seeing Afghan interpreter in UK Stay home, female Kabul government workers told The email was sent to interpreters who remain in Afghanistan or have been able to get to other countries. Their email addresses could be seen by all recipients, showing people's names and some associated profile pictures. The Information Commissioner (ICO), which has the power to issue enforcement notices and fines in the most serious cases, is already making enquiries with the MoD. A spokesperson for the watchdog said people rightly expected their personal information to be handled securely especially where its loss could have devastating consequences, including possible threat to life. Conservative MP Tobias Ellwood, who chairs the defence select committee, warned that the Taliban had not changed. ""We must get these interpreters out or they'll be hunted and killed,"" he told MPs, and suggested using ""clandestine means"" to get them to safety, if usual methods were unavailable. ""All means will be explored,"" Mr Wallace replied. British forces were in Afghanistan for about 20 years The email was sent by the team in charge of the UK's Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy (Arap), which has been in contact with them since the Taliban took control of the country last month. The team told the interpreters it was doing everything it could to help relocate them. It also said they should not put themselves or their families at risk if it was not safe for them to leave their current location. But one interpreter who received the email realised that more than 250 Afghans who worked with British forces had been copied into the email. ""This mistake could cost the life of interpreters, especially for those who are still in Afghanistan,"" they told the BBC. ""Some of the interpreters didn't notice the mistake and they replied to all the emails already and they explained their situation which is very dangerous. The email contains their profile pictures and contact details."" The MoD then sent another email 30 minutes later with the title ""Urgent - Arap case contact"" asking the recipients to delete the previous email and warning ""your email address may have been compromised"". It recommended the interpreters change their email addresses. Mr Wallace said the Ministry of Defence believed there were 900 ""credible cases"" for Arap resettlement still in Afghanistan beyond the 311 the government is currently speaking to. Labour shadow defence secretary John Healey welcomed the defence secretary's apology but told the Commons that action now mattered most. He told MPs: ""These Afghan interpreters worked alongside our British forces and the government rightly pledged to protect them. Ministers must make good on those promises now."" Ahmad, not his real name, is one of the 250 or so whose names were mistakenly shared by the MoD. In 2011, he was shot by the Taliban while working as an interpreter with British troops in Helmand. He's currently in hiding in Afghanistan, living apart from his wife and baby daughter for their own safety. He told the BBC he was really shocked and disappointed when he spotted the MoD's mistake. ""Just when you think it can't get worse than this, along comes the Arap team and does something that proves you wrong. I didn't really expect this from them,"" he said. ""I'm 100% sure that it will have a negative impact on our safety because you know that we are already displaced from our home town. ""Now we have to change our locations again and we have to change our email addresses."" Ahmad added that he now doubted whether he would ever get to safety in the UK. ""I'm not very optimistic, because when I see their carelessness and their neglect, I don't think we're going to be in the UK in the near future."" But he said he was clinging to hope that the UK would ""finally do the right thing"". Have you been affected by the issues raised in this story? Tell us by emailing:haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

"Nicola Sturgeon has urged venues to use ""common sense"" when checking vaccine passports, as she set out details of where and when they will be required. Major events and venues such as nightclubs will be expected to ensure that everyone present has had two doses of vaccine from the start of October. However spot-checks will be allowed at larger events, with organisers expected to do a ""reasonable number"" of checks. The first minister said the scheme will help reduce transmission of the virus. And she said it could encourage uptake of vaccines and help keep venues like nightclubs open for business. Some business leaders voiced concerns that the scheme ""goes well beyond what was initially proposed"" and could impact on hotels, pubs and other hospitality venues. Live: Nicola Sturgeon updates MSPs on Covid-19 plans Scotland to launch vaccine passports on 1 October What do we know about the vaccine passport? Ms Sturgeon told MSPs that Covid-19 cases had fallen in Scotland in recent weeks, but warned that ""the position remains fragile"" with the NHS under ""sustained pressure"". The government's vaccine certification scheme will come into force at 05:00 on 1 October, with people over the age of 18 required to show they have had both doses of vaccine before they will be allowed entry to: Nightclubs and adult entertainment venues Unseated indoor live events, with more than 500 people in the audience Unseated outdoor live events, with more than 4,000 people in the audience Any event, of any nature, which has more than 10,000 people in attendance Certificates will be displayed via an app, which will be available for download from 30 September, while venue staff will either scan this using another app or visually check the QR code shown, The government has drawn up a working definition of a ""nightclub"" as being a venue which is open between midnight and 05:00, serving alcohol, and which has a designated area for dancing and provides live or recorded music for this purpose. Ms Sturgeon said detailed guidance would be published, but said venues should use ""common sense"" over the scheme. She said a venue which has a dancefloor would not have to check people coming in for a pub lunch in the afternoon, but said ""it would be reasonable"" to check customers who arrive later in the evening. The first minister added: ""A pragmatic approach will be encouraged, so that businesses can make sensible judgements."" While clubs and smaller events will be expected to inspect the certificates of all customers, the organisers of larger events will have to carry out a ""reasonable number"" of checks. Aberdeen nightclub owner and spokesman for the Night Time Industries Association Scotland, Gavin Stevenson, toldBBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programmethe definition was still confusing. ""It is not a definition of just nightclubs because it includes about 2,000 pubs and bars across Scotland in addition to the 100 nightclubs that are actual nightclubs. ""It would be fair to say that it has not in any way been communicated well by the Scottish government with only nine days to go until this policy is implemented."" He added: ""Typically pubs would have opening hours up until about 01:00 and most of them would have some form of entertainment on at the weekends. This will also apply to lots of city centre circuit bars and to hotel function rooms with parties or events going on in them. ""These venues will now have to take on door staff to control entry when they would previously have had no requirement to do so under their existing licences. There is a critical shortage of door staff and it won't be possible to implement this by 1 October so we have raised our concerns with government on that basis that this is a fundamentally unworkable plan."" Football chiefs had saidspot-checks would be ""the only practical reality""when dealing with matches involving tens of thousands of fans, warning of lengthy queues and potential for disorder if every attendee was checked. Ms Sturgeon said there had been talks with football clubs and licensed trade organisations, saying their feedback had been ""very helpful"". The Scottish Chambers of Commerce was critical of the plans, with chief executive Liz Cameron claiming ""thousands"" of businesses would be caught up in the scheme. She said: ""We have made it clear that the practical application of what is being asked is not workable in the timelines being proposed. ""Scotland's economy remains fragile, and many businesses remain in survival mode - there is no doubt that vaccine certifications will serve as an economic detriment."" Opposition parties at Holyrood - which all voted against the plans butsaw them approvedby MSPs from the SNP-Green administration - also called for greater clarity about the plans. Scottish Conservative health spokesman Sandesh Gulhane said: ""The SNP government vaccine passport scheme comes into force next week, and the first minister is still finalising guidance and businesses are worried about the impact it will have on them. ""Despite promises of a reset, it is clear that jobs and businesses are still not the priority of this government."" Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said detail had been provided ""at long last"", but the government was still falling short. He said: ""There are still big gaps in the detail, still limited engagement with businesses affected, and limited evidence published of the difference it will make."" Mr Sarwar added that it was ""at best disingenuous"" to suggest the scheme is the same asone being set up in Wales, where people will have to provide either proof of vaccination or a recent negative test. Ms Sturgeon said the problem with the Welsh scheme was that it relied on self-reporting of test results, which she said was ""not the best approach"" and would not drive up the uptake rates of vaccines.

"This video can not be played Watch: President Biden's first UN General Assembly speech In his first address to the United Nations, US President Joe Biden has urged global cooperation through ""a decisive decade for our world"". His calls for unity come amid tensions with allies over the US' Afghanistan withdrawal and a major diplomatic row with France over a submarine deal. The US also announced it was doubling its climate finance pledge by 2024. Reaffirming his support for democracy and diplomacy, Mr Biden said: ""We must work together like never before."" The 76th General Assembly in New York City takes place against the backdrop of a climate crisis and a once-in-a-century pandemic, both of which have sharpened global divides. Mr Biden pushed for cooperation on these fronts, saying: ""Whether we choose to fight for our shared future or not will reverberate for generations to come. Simply put, we stand, in my view, at an inflection point in history."" Mr Biden on Tuesday stressed that the US is ""not seeking a new Cold War or a world divided into rigid blocs"". The US, he said, ""is ready to work with any nation that steps up and pursues peaceful resolution to shared challenges, even if we have intense disagreements in other areas"". The remark appeared to be a response to UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, who this weekend warned the US and China were headed for ""a Cold War that would be different from the past one, and probably more dangerous and more difficult to manage"". The president also touted the pullout from Afghanistan, which has been criticised by allies at home and abroad, saying the US was ending a ""period of relentless war"" for a ""new era of relentless diplomacy"". Mr Biden offered a key pledge on climate finance as well, saying the US will increase funding for developing countries to $11.4bn (Â£8.3bn) by 2024. This means the US will offer just over half of the European Union's pledge to help poorer nations cope with climate change. Has climate pledge to poor countries been met? The developed world had pledged to provide these countries $100bn a year by 2020 but this has still not been achieved. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson - who is meeting with Mr Biden later on Tuesday - praised the ""massive contribution"" and said the US had ""stepped up to the plate"". At the end of his first address, Mr Biden promised that the US would lead ""with our allies"". ""We will lead on all the greatest challenges of our time, from Covid to climate, human dignity and human rights, but we will not go it alone,"" he said. World leaders at odds with former President Donald Trump had hoped for a more stable and reliable America under his successor's leadership - but Mr Biden's most recent foreign policy moves have made some uneasy. The US' lack of coordination during the Afghanistan exit after two decades of war rankled allies and led to an international scramble to evacuate. The Nato mission at the time of the withdrawal comprised troops from 36 countries, three-quarters of whom were non-American. How Europe's relationship with Joe Biden turned sour Last week, a trilateral US-UK deal to provide Australia with nuclear-powered submarines infuriated the French, who had their own five-year-old contract to build conventional submarines for the Australians. French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian described the agreement as ""a stab in the back"", and the top French diplomats in both countries were recalled. The Biden administration has also seen international criticism over alleged US hoarding of Covid-19 vaccines and non-reciprocal travel restrictions, as well as frugality with climate aid. After four years of America First and Donald Trump's isolationist nationalism, this was a speech the leaders of the liberal democracies wanted to cheer. But Joe Biden's first appearance before the UN General Assembly will be treated with a good deal of scepticism after America's shambolic departure from Afghanistan. That said, the US president was determined to push his more outward looking view of the world. And turning a page, he was able to say this was the first time in 20 years that America wasn't at war. British diplomats will have cheered his pledge to double to $11.4bn the money to tackle climate change by 2024 - something they have been lobbying the White House relentlessly on. One issue that enjoys bipartisan support in Washington is the threat posed by China - the driving force behind the new security partnership with Britain and Australia. He didn't mention the world's other superpower by name, but it's clear who he was talking about. The US president has had a torrid, horrid summer. This speech was an attempt to reassure America's international allies - and to put flesh on the bones of his claim that ""America is back"".

"This video can not be played Tim Davie: ""I think we've got a real battle on our hands, I walk a tightrope every day on this, but we've got to fight for it."" It is harder than ever for the BBC to maintain impartiality amid the ""culture wars"" and a polarisation of online views, its director general has said. The corporation has ""done it pretty well for 99 years"" and still is, Tim Davie has told a committee of MPs. ""I just think it's tougher now, by the way,"" he said on Tuesday. ""I think the culture wars are raging, I think we've got a real battle on our hands. ""I walk a tightrope every day on this, but we've got to fight for it."" Impartiality is ""sacrosanct"", said Mr Davie, whose headaches over the issue since taking over a year ago have ranged from ruling onwhether Newsnight's Emily Maitlis should have shared a tweet from Piers Morganabout the government's response to the pandemic, towhether staff can attend Pride marches. The BBC is ""nothing if it's not a good facilitator of proper open debate and diverse views"", he told the House of Commons media select committee. ""I think that's essential to us. It's mission critical. It's us, and it puts you in a very different place to where the rest of the world is heading in my view, which is a dangerous place around partial media. ""I and others feel very passionately about this. We're in a battle for this, and I think we need to really be clear that we're not perfect. We've got plenty of work to do to facilitate a space where we can properly debate these issues."" He said the BBC must hire people from across the political spectrum, even if they know they must leave their personal views at the door. The hearing came after the appointment of former HuffPost UK editorJess Brammar to a senior role in BBC News, despite a row over old tweets that were critical of Brexit and the government. BBC director of newsFran Unsworth announced her resignationshortly before Ms Brammar was appointed executive editor of BBC news channels, but Mr Davie said her decision to leave had ""nothing to do with the latest incident"". He added: ""I just saw a senior hire in [BBC] online going to someone from The Daily Telegraph. We need to hire the best as the BBC and we need to hire across the political spectrum."" Referring to the choice of Ms Brammar, he said: ""That is an incredibly important precedent and this affair is dangerous territory for us, not because of the process, but if people begin doubting our ability to hire people with [political] views into the BBC, and when they get here they leave them at the door."" Mr Davie also warned that the corporation was losing stars in a ""red hot"" battle with rivals and streaming services. ""We're in an incredibly inflationary market,"" he said. ""And we have lost people. Graham Norton has gone to Virgin Radio, and we've lost people to GB News, to LBC and other places. They're being poached."" Michaela Coel won an Emmy Award for her BBC drama I May Destroy You on Sunday He also referred to Fleabag creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge, whosigned an exclusive deal with Amazon Prime. Michaela Coel, however,has spoken about rejecting $1m (Â£730,000) from Netflixfor her acclaimed drama I May Destroy You because the BBC offered her more creative control. ""Life is not just about money,"" Mr Davie said. ""It's also about the creative experience you get. It's about making Normal People, it's about making something wonderful in drama or some of the documentaries [and] that ability to actually be on BBC One and have a big audience. ""So I wouldn't be too depressed about it. Having said that, I think, over time, there will be increasing pressure on us."" Mr Davie was also asked about former BBC correspondent Martin Bashir, whowas found to have acted ""deceitfully""to gain his 1995 interview with Princess Diana. That scandal has also put the spotlight on his other work, including an investigation into the 1986 murders of two girls. Michelle Hadaway, the mother of one of the victims, has said Bashir took her daughter Karen's clothesbut did not do the promised DNA testing or return the clothing. Martin Bashir has told BBC bosses he doesn't know what happened to the clothes ""We are extremely sorry for the distress this has caused Ms Hadaway,"" Mr Davie said. ""It's very distressing that we haven't been able to give her answers in terms of what happened to that clothing, and I'm appalled that that got lost. It's a very serious issue."" BBC sorry over loss of murdered girl's clothes A new attempt to find them has not yielded results, he said. ""With a slightly heavy heart, we're at a point where we are where we are, which is the clothingâ¦ and we have talked directly to Martin Bashir rather than through any agent. ""He doesn't know where the clothes are. I didn't speak to himâ¦ but he just doesn't know where the clothes are. Any other evidence coming to us, of course, we will proactively look at.""

"This video can not be played Justin Trudeau: ""Millions of Canadians have chosen a progressive plan"" Justin Trudeau's Liberal Party has narrowly won Canada's election, but it failed to secure a majority of seats. This is Mr Trudeau's third federal election win, but his critics say the poll was a waste of time. The Liberals are projected to win 158 seats, short of the 170 seats needed for the majority Mr Trudeau was seeking with his early election call. The Conservatives have held onto their main opposition status and are expected to win about 122 seats. ""There are still votes to be counted but what we've seen tonight is millions of Canadians have chosen a progressive plan,"" Mr Trudeau told supporters in Montreal in the early hours of Tuesday morning. ""You elected a government that will fight for you and deliver for you,"" he said. The election, which took place during a fourth pandemic wave in Canada, was the most expensive in the country's history, costing some C$600m ($470m; Â£344m). The projected results suggest a parliament strikingly similar to the one elected just two years ago in 2019. The snap election call, sending Canadians to the polls for the second time in two years, was widely seen as a bid by Mr Trudeau to secure a majority government and he struggled to explain why a campaign was necessary. Conservative leader Erin O'Toole suggested it was a waste of time and money. ""Canadians sent him back with another minority at a cost of $600m and deeper divisions in our great country"", he told reporters. Mr Trudeau maintained that the election gave the incoming government a clear mandate in moving forward. But over the course of the campaign, he struggled to convince voters of the need for an election, which also coincided with rising Covid-19 case loads due to the Delta variant. Separately he was also heckled by anti-vaccine protesters on the campaign trail, with some shouting they would refuse the Covid jab. While questions will inevitably be raised about Mr Trudeau's political future, Liberal MP Pablo Rodriguez told journalists early in the evening that no matter the outcome, he had  ""100% confidence"" in him as Liberal Party leader. ""And all the members of the party do as well,"" he said. The country's left-wing New Democrats (NDP), which ran on a ""tax the ultra-rich"" message with leader Jagmeet Singh trying to tap into progressive voters frustrated with the Liberals, looks to have picked up a small number of seats. Vote counts will continue to trickle in over the coming days as elections officials tally the roughly one million mail-in ballots cast this election, and current seat tallies are still to be finalised. Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole speaks from Oshawa, Ontario For the Conservatives, the result is a disappointment for new party leader Erin O'Toole, who ran on a centrist message in a bid to expand the party's base of support. Like in 2019, the party is projected to have won the popular vote. But the first-past-the-post system - awarding victory to the candidate with most votes in any given constituency - means that has not translated to seats won. Speaking to party faithful in Oshawa, Ontario, a defiant Mr O'Toole pitched his vision for a bigger Conservative tent, saying: ""Our party needed the courage to change because Canada has changed."" He urged supporters not to waiver from the commitment to grow the party's base, acknowledging that ""clearly there is more work for us to do"" in setting the stage for a better showing in the next campaign. Election night - as it happened Trudeau - a life in politics The man who hoped to topple Trudeau Conservative strategist Jason Lietaer told journalists at party headquarters that there's reason to keep  Mr O'Toole on as leader despite his failure to secure them a victory. ""He's gone from unknown to contender in just a few weeks,"" Mr Lietaer said. ""O'Toole was a huge underdog. To be within a few points is something we're all proud of."" Jagmeet Singh speaks alongside his pregnant wife While minority governments are common in Canada, coalitions are extremely rare and Mr Trudeau will need to compromise with opposition parties to pass legislation. The NDP are likely to be kingmakers in this new parliament, and could help the Liberals to survive key confidence votes and get their policies through. Mr Singh, the NDP leader, speaking in Burnaby, British Columbia, noted he had secured concessions from Mr Trudeau in the last parliament. He said he had a laundry list of priorities this time around, and vowed to push for action on climate change, affordable housing, and healthcare. ""You can be sure if we work together we can build a better society,"" he said. The night saw setbacks for both the Green Party and the People's Party of Canada (PPC). New Green leader Annamie Paul was badly defeated in her efforts to secure a seat in Toronto, after she struggled with internal party divisions that threatened her leadership. ""I am disappointed - it is hard to lose, no one likes to lose,"" Ms Paul said as she thanked supporters. Still, the party is still projected to send at least two members of parliament to Ottawa. The PPC failed to secure any seats despite a late surge as its populist leader tapped into a vein of anger among some Canadians over vaccine mandates and lockdown measures, but did increase its overall vote share.

Yousaf also announced a boost of Â£20 million to the ambulance service budget. Read more here. We're closing the live page soon - but before we go, here is a re-cap of the main coronavirus developments this Tuesday:  Vaccine uptake has slowed dramatically since the summer as figures show. On Monday - which saw the start of vaccinations for 12-15-year-olds in England and Scotland - 24,684 first jabs were given and 46,451 second doses were administered across the UK. Meanwhile daily deaths are rising - 203 deaths were recorded on Tuesday. Case numbers, though, are still falling, despite schools returning in both England and Wales at the start of this month. As we mentioned earlier, the firsthealthy 12 to 15-year-olds in England and Scotland began receiving Covid jabsthis week. Invites are also being sent out in Wales this week, while in Northern Ireland teen vaccinations are likely to start in October. Across the UK pupils this age are being offered a single Pfizer dose to help limit further disruption to their education. Most will receive the jab in a school setting. Evidence suggests a single dose cuts the risk of catching the Delta variant by about 55%. So will pupils still be encouraged to take lateral flow tests at home - and what happens if they test positive? And what about face coverings, social distancing and ventilation of school buildings? Everything you need to knowis here. Passes will be compulsory for those aged over 18 to enter certain events. Covid passes should be approved by the Senedd before they become compulsory, say opposition parties in Wales. From 11 October, people attending big events and nightclubs in Wales must show they are fully vaccinated or have tested negative in the previous 48 hours.

Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent There were fears September would see cases start to take
off. The return of more normal mixing patterns with schools back
and people going into the office would â some predicted â lead to a new surge. We are now two-thirds of the way through the month and the
opposite has happened â cases have fallen. Dig beneath the headline figures and there is a little more
volatility, Scotland has seen a rapid rise, but that appears to have peaked. This is now translating to falling numbers in hospital
overall â a trend which is likely to continue for the rest of the month. Deaths are averaging close to 150 a day. That may seem a
lot, but it is worth pointing out that it is similar to what you would see for
months on end during a bad flu winter. The big question now though is what happens next as the
nights draw in. There is uncertainty, but the longer cases remain in check
the more hope it gives us that UK has truly reached an equilibrium whereby the
amount of immunity built up through vaccination and natural infection is enough
to keep the virus at bay while society returns to normal. A young offender institution is declaring itself a Covid-19 ""outbreak site"" after""a high number"" of inmates tested positive for the virus. HMYOI Aylesbury, in Buckinghamshire, houses boys and men aged between 17 and 21. In a tweet it says it has ""restricted the regime"" on one wing ""as Covid has returned to the prison"". An HM Prison Service spokesman says precautionary measures are being taken at the institution in line with public health guidance. HMYOI Aylesbury says on Twitter: ""Unfortunately we have had to restrict the regime on one of our wings as Covid has returned to the prison with a high number of prisoners testing positive. ""We are now classed as an outbreak site. ""We are sorry for any impact this has on you and your loved ones as we try to contain the virus."" A further 203 deaths, among people who tested positive  for coronavirus over the past 28 days, have been reported in the UK, according tothe government's latest figures,external. In addition, 31,564 new cases were reported in the past 24 hours. In his first address to the United Nations, and against the backdrop of a once-in-a-century pandemic, US President Joe Bidenpledges cooperation with allies through ""a decisive decade for our world"". ""I believe we must work together like never before,"" he says. In the context of Covid and the growing climate crisis - both of which have sharpened global divides - Biden pushes for cooperation, saying: ""Our own success is bound up in others succeeding as well."" The 76th General Assembly in New York City is currently taking place. While the UK government announced last week plans to scrap PCR tests for returning, fully-jabbed, international travellers to England, Wales' first minister saysthis is a ""step away"" from a duty to people's health. Mark Drakeford says ministers in Wales face a ""difficult decision"" - with the nation not yet having decided whether to follow England. He says the tests allow scientists to detect new variants of the virus. From 1 October, for travellers to England, PCR tests will no longer be required on day two and this will be replaced instead by a cheaper lateral flow test. Concerns have also beenraised in Scotlandabout the change to the testing regime. Drakeford says the ""most concerning"" decision is moving away from PCR tests on day two, ""because that was the strongest defence against the re-importation of viruses from elsewhere in the world"". ""In Wales we genomic sequence a higher proportion of tests than any other part of the United Kingdom and it is that sequencing that allows the very skilled scientists who do it to identify new variations in coronavirus,"" he says. However the fact that many Welsh travellers travel to the UK via England made it a ""difficult decision"", with English ports not keen to communicate differences in rules. Simon Clarke, Conservative MP and chief secretary to the Treasury,  has defended the government decision to end the Covid Universal Credit uplift. The Â£20-a-weekincrease in Universal Credit is due to end in October,but many have criticised the government move at a time when prices and bills are rising for most households. ""All the evidence now points to a rebounding Labour market,"" Clarke tells the House of Commons. He refers to ONS figures last week ""which reported that [job] vacancies were at a record high"", adding that the unemployment rate fallen for seven consecutive months. ""People have been coming off the furlough scheme very rapidly now. Numbers are down from 5.1 million in January to 1.6 million at the end of July."" ""The furlough scheme has been absolutely essential to supporting the UK throughout this very difficult period. It has been an historic success."" But he adds: ""Broader economic growth has exceeded expectations as restrictions have been lifted."" And concludes: ""The best way to help vulnerable people is to provide them with the opportunities that they need for well-paid work."" Nadine with her brother Ash Cooper and her sister Victoria Cooper, the last time they were all together in 2019 Nadine Beasley, from Bournemouth, is one of those who have been waiting to visit her family in the US. Despite the change in travel rules she is going to miss her sisterâs wedding, for which she is maid of honour, by days. However, she will be reunited with her family at Christmas. ""My sister is getting married on 30 October in
California,"" she says. ""I was meant to be her maid of honour, my daughter a flowergirl. ""We
were due to fly out on 22 October, so we're naturally upset about the ban being
lifted in November, because we'll miss her wedding by days. ""However, we've now made our fourth rebooking since February
2020 to fly out on 20 December. So that means Christmas with my parents and my
siblings, who are all in California, which is better than the last 18 months of
waiting and knowing nothing."" With the travel ban she has not seen her siblings or parents for more than two years. She says it is annoying that she will miss her sister's wedding by days, having already missed her brother's but says the fact there is ""light at the end of the tunnel"" in the form of a date means it feels like ""a weightâs been lifted"". ""Weâre going with my nan. Itâs bittersweet because we lost
grandad,"" she adds. The UK government has borrowed record-breaking amounts to pay for measures designed to limit the impact of coronavirus. Government initiatives such as the furlough scheme are estimated to have cost up to Â£70bn by the time they come to an end on 30 September. And sadly it turns out there's no such thing as a magic money tree.

More than 16 million people have now downloaded the app, with more than 12 million in England doing so since 17 May when the Covid Pass feature to prove vaccination for events and foreign travel was added to it. Some 1.5 million people have now registered their organ donation decision through the platform, with 265,000 of those doing it via the app for the first time, according to the Department of Health and Social Care. Around 150,000 people registered their preference from May. It comes after a new ""opt-out"" organ donation system came into effect last year, known as Max and Keira's law.
The law is named after Keira Ball, who died aged nine in 2017, and Max Johnson, now aged 13, who was saved by her heart. The US will let fully vaccinated travellers from the UK - and many other countries - visit from November. The change in rules, follows a shake-up of England's travel regulations on Friday. Put simply, going overseas is becoming a little bit easier, although, as before, different rules apply for the devolved nations. So where and when can you go, what are the rules around vaccination - and what's happening with the so-called traffic light system which saw countries divided into red, amber and green categories?

pupils (0.7%) were absent from school in England at the end of last week
with a confirmed case of Covid, according to the latest Department for
Education attendance figures. A further 45,000 (0.5%) were absent due
to a suspected case. Some 2,000 pupils were absent due to
restrictions in place to manage a Covid outbreak. Fewer than 500 were absent
due to Covid-related school closures. At the end of last term in July, when
bubble systems were in place, more than a million children were absent for
Covid-related reasons. Those figures included 774,000 who were isolating due to
contact with a positive case in school and 81,000 who had a confirmed or
suspected case. A police photo shows the takeaway stash seized by officers New Zealand police have made a bizarre arrest after a pair of alleged gang associates were caught trying to enter Auckland with a boot full of Kentucky Fried Chicken - and tens of thousands of dollars. Under Auckland's strict Level 4 lockdown, all restaurants - including take-away services - remain closed. Police said the men, aged 23 and 30, had travelled from Hamilton, about 75 miles south of Auckland. A police spokesperson told the BBC that officers made the arrest after they noticed a suspicious-looking vehicle travelling on a gravel road on the outskirts of the city. After a chase, the vehicle was stopped and searched. Police located NZ$100,000 (US$70,000; Â£51,000) in cash, as well as at least three buckets of chicken, about 10 cups of coleslaw, a large pack of fries, and four large bags containing other KFC items. The spokesperson said that the men would appear in court for breaching public health rules later in the year - but added that further charges are also likely. The investigation is ongoing. Under New Zealand's tough anti-Covid laws, fines can reach up to NZ$4,000 and can even involve prison sentences of up to six months. Auckland will move to a Level 3 lockdown from midnight on Tuesday, but residents will remain confined to their homes unless they are attending school, work or shopping. As mask wearing on public transport continues to decline, transport unions have expressed concern that it would be difficult to
reintroduce the policy if the government decided to do so. Mike Lynch, general secretary of the RMT union said his
members had noticed a marked policy drift since the government changed the
rules in July. Even where mask wearing remains mandatory, many people were ignoring the rules, he said. He added: ""As more people see others failing to comply, the situation will escalate quickly over the autumn."" ""With the government already making compulsory
mask wearing on transport a contingency if cases escalate in the coming weeks,
there is a real danger they won't be able to get the genie back into the
bottle."" Mick Whelan, general secretary of train driversâ union Aslef, agreed there had been ""a decline, in recent days"" even where mask-wearing is ostensibly required. âWe believe mask wearing should be mandatory on
trains.To protect
passengers and staff and to control the Covid-19 pandemic."" A spokesperson for Unite. which represents bus drivers, said mask wearing was ""collapsing - and has got much worse in
recent weeks"". âIn some cases there are very few passengers wearing masks on a bus, with those
who tend to still wear a mask being older."" Unions are warning that mask wearing on public transport has dropped significantly since it no longer became a legal requirement in England in July. The proportion of people using face coverings at major railway stations is estimated to have slumped from around 80% to around 20%. A government spokesperson said the lifting of restrictions relied on people taking ""personal responsibility"". ""The guidance is clear that people are expected and recommended to wear a mask when they come into contact with people they donât normally meet in enclosed and crowded spaces. âIt is open to transport operators to decide if they want to implement their own policies, working within their particular environment.â Transport for London (TfL), in keeping with many other operators, still require members of the public to wear a mask when travelling. âCovid is still with us and we all have a role to play in doing the right thing and keeping each other safe,"" said Siwan Hayward, Director of Policing and Compliance for TfL ""Wearing a face covering on our services and in our stations is still required under TfLâs condition of carriage,"" she said. She added that ""more than 500 uniformed officers"" were enforcing mask wearing on the network and ""non-exempt customers who fail to comply may be refused travel"".  Â© 2025 BBC.

We're closing the live page soon - but before we go, here is a re-cap of the main coronavirus developments this Tuesday:  Vaccine uptake has slowed dramatically since the summer as figures show. On Monday - which saw the start of vaccinations for 12-15-year-olds in England and Scotland - 24,684 first jabs were given and 46,451 second doses were administered across the UK. Meanwhile daily deaths are rising - 203 deaths were recorded on Tuesday. Case numbers, though, are still falling, despite schools returning in both England and Wales at the start of this month. As we mentioned earlier, the firsthealthy 12 to 15-year-olds in England and Scotland began receiving Covid jabsthis week. Invites are also being sent out in Wales this week, while in Northern Ireland teen vaccinations are likely to start in October. Across the UK pupils this age are being offered a single Pfizer dose to help limit further disruption to their education. Most will receive the jab in a school setting. Evidence suggests a single dose cuts the risk of catching the Delta variant by about 55%. So will pupils still be encouraged to take lateral flow tests at home - and what happens if they test positive? And what about face coverings, social distancing and ventilation of school buildings? Everything you need to knowis here. Passes will be compulsory for those aged over 18 to enter certain events. Covid passes should be approved by the Senedd before they become compulsory, say opposition parties in Wales.

nights draw in. There is uncertainty, but the longer cases remain in check
the more hope it gives us that UK has truly reached an equilibrium whereby the
amount of immunity built up through vaccination and natural infection is enough
to keep the virus at bay while society returns to normal. A young offender institution is declaring itself a Covid-19 ""outbreak site"" after""a high number"" of inmates tested positive for the virus. HMYOI Aylesbury, in Buckinghamshire, houses boys and men aged between 17 and 21. In a tweet it says it has ""restricted the regime"" on one wing ""as Covid has returned to the prison"". An HM Prison Service spokesman says precautionary measures are being taken at the institution in line with public health guidance. HMYOI Aylesbury says on Twitter: ""Unfortunately we have had to restrict the regime on one of our wings as Covid has returned to the prison with a high number of prisoners testing positive. ""We are now classed as an outbreak site. ""We are sorry for any impact this has on you and your loved ones as we try to contain the virus."" A further 203 deaths, among people who tested positive  for coronavirus over the past 28 days, have been reported in the UK, according tothe government's latest figures,external. In addition, 31,564 new cases were reported in the past 24 hours. In his first address to the United Nations, and against the backdrop of a once-in-a-century pandemic, US President Joe Bidenpledges cooperation with allies through ""a decisive decade for our world"". ""I believe we must work together like never before,"" he says. In the context of Covid and the growing climate crisis - both of which have sharpened global divides - Biden pushes for cooperation, saying: ""Our own success is bound up in others succeeding as well."" The 76th General Assembly in New York City is currently taking place. While the UK government announced last week plans to scrap PCR tests for returning, fully-jabbed, international travellers to England, Wales' first minister saysthis is a ""step away"" from a duty to people's health. Mark Drakeford says ministers in Wales face a ""difficult decision"" - with the nation not yet having decided whether to follow England. He says the tests allow scientists to detect new variants of the virus. From 1 October, for travellers to England, PCR tests will no longer be required on day two and this will be replaced instead by a cheaper lateral flow test. Concerns have also beenraised in Scotlandabout the change to the testing regime. Drakeford says the ""most concerning"" decision is moving away from PCR tests on day two, ""because that was the strongest defence against the re-importation of viruses from elsewhere in the world"". ""In Wales we genomic sequence a higher proportion of tests than any other part of the United Kingdom and it is that sequencing that allows the very skilled scientists who do it to identify new variations in coronavirus,"" he says. However the fact that many Welsh travellers travel to the UK via England made it a ""difficult decision"", with English ports not keen to communicate differences in rules. Simon Clarke, Conservative MP and chief secretary to the Treasury,  has defended the government decision to end the Covid Universal Credit uplift. The Â£20-a-weekincrease in Universal Credit is due to end in October,but many have criticised the government move at a time when prices and bills are rising for most households. ""All the evidence now points to a rebounding Labour market,"" Clarke tells the House of Commons. He refers to ONS figures last week ""which reported that [job] vacancies were at a record high"", adding that the unemployment rate fallen for seven consecutive months. ""People have been coming off the furlough scheme very rapidly now. Numbers are down from 5.1 million in January to 1.6 million at the end of July."" ""The furlough scheme has been absolutely essential to supporting the UK throughout this very difficult period. It has been an historic success."" But he adds: ""Broader economic growth has exceeded expectations as restrictions have been lifted."" And concludes: ""The best way to help vulnerable people is to provide them with the opportunities that they need for well-paid work."" Nadine with her brother Ash Cooper and her sister Victoria Cooper, the last time they were all together in 2019 Nadine Beasley, from Bournemouth, is one of those who have been waiting to visit her family in the US. Despite the change in travel rules she is going to miss her sisterâs wedding, for which she is maid of honour, by days. However, she will be reunited with her family at Christmas. ""My sister is getting married on 30 October in
California,"" she says. ""I was meant to be her maid of honour, my daughter a flowergirl. ""We
were due to fly out on 22 October, so we're naturally upset about the ban being
lifted in November, because we'll miss her wedding by days. ""However, we've now made our fourth rebooking since February
2020 to fly out on 20 December. So that means Christmas with my parents and my
siblings, who are all in California, which is better than the last 18 months of
waiting and knowing nothing."" With the travel ban she has not seen her siblings or parents for more than two years. She says it is annoying that she will miss her sister's wedding by days, having already missed her brother's but says the fact there is ""light at the end of the tunnel"" in the form of a date means it feels like ""a weightâs been lifted"". ""Weâre going with my nan. Itâs bittersweet because we lost
grandad,"" she adds. The UK government has borrowed record-breaking amounts to pay for measures designed to limit the impact of coronavirus. Government initiatives such as the furlough scheme are estimated to have cost up to Â£70bn by the time they come to an end on 30 September. And sadly it turns out there's no such thing as a magic money tree. So how much exactly has the government borrowed over the course of the pandemic, who has it borrowed from - and when does it have to be paid back? Find out here.

More than 16 million people have now downloaded the app, with more than 12 million in England doing so since 17 May when the Covid Pass feature to prove vaccination for events and foreign travel was added to it. Some 1.5 million people have now registered their organ donation decision through the platform, with 265,000 of those doing it via the app for the first time, according to the Department of Health and Social Care. Around 150,000 people registered their preference from May. It comes after a new ""opt-out"" organ donation system came into effect last year, known as Max and Keira's law.
The law is named after Keira Ball, who died aged nine in 2017, and Max Johnson, now aged 13, who was saved by her heart. The US will let fully vaccinated travellers from the UK - and many other countries - visit from November. The change in rules, follows a shake-up of England's travel regulations on Friday. Put simply, going overseas is becoming a little bit easier, although, as before, different rules apply for the devolved nations. So where and when can you go, what are the rules around vaccination - and what's happening with the so-called traffic light system which saw countries divided into red, amber and green categories? We have all the answershere.  Katherine SmithBBC News In England 59,000
pupils (0.7%) were absent from school in England at the end of last week
with a confirmed case of Covid, according to the latest Department for
Education attendance figures. A further 45,000 (0.5%) were absent due
to a suspected case. Some 2,000 pupils were absent due to
restrictions in place to manage a Covid outbreak. Fewer than 500 were absent
due to Covid-related school closures. At the end of last term in July, when
bubble systems were in place, more than a million children were absent for
Covid-related reasons. Those figures included 774,000 who were isolating due to
contact with a positive case in school and 81,000 who had a confirmed or
suspected case. A police photo shows the takeaway stash seized by officers New Zealand police have made a bizarre arrest after a pair of alleged gang associates were caught trying to enter Auckland with a boot full of Kentucky Fried Chicken - and tens of thousands of dollars. Under Auckland's strict Level 4 lockdown, all restaurants - including take-away services - remain closed. Police said the men, aged 23 and 30, had travelled from Hamilton, about 75 miles south of Auckland. A police spokesperson told the BBC that officers made the arrest after they noticed a suspicious-looking vehicle travelling on a gravel road on the outskirts of the city. After a chase, the vehicle was stopped and searched. Police located NZ$100,000 (US$70,000; Â£51,000) in cash, as well as at least three buckets of chicken, about 10 cups of coleslaw, a large pack of fries, and four large bags containing other KFC items. The spokesperson said that the men would appear in court for breaching public health rules later in the year - but added that further charges are also likely. The investigation is ongoing. Under New Zealand's tough anti-Covid laws, fines can reach up to NZ$4,000 and can even involve prison sentences of up to six months. Auckland will move to a Level 3 lockdown from midnight on Tuesday, but residents will remain confined to their homes unless they are attending school, work or shopping. As mask wearing on public transport continues to decline, transport unions have expressed concern that it would be difficult to
reintroduce the policy if the government decided to do so. Mike Lynch, general secretary of the RMT union said his
members had noticed a marked policy drift since the government changed the
rules in July. Even where mask wearing remains mandatory, many people were ignoring the rules, he said. He added: ""As more people see others failing to comply, the situation will escalate quickly over the autumn."" ""With the government already making compulsory
mask wearing on transport a contingency if cases escalate in the coming weeks,
there is a real danger they won't be able to get the genie back into the
bottle."" Mick Whelan, general secretary of train driversâ union Aslef, agreed there had been ""a decline, in recent days"" even where mask-wearing is ostensibly required. âWe believe mask wearing should be mandatory on
trains.To protect
passengers and staff and to control the Covid-19 pandemic."" A spokesperson for Unite. which represents bus drivers, said mask wearing was ""collapsing - and has got much worse in
recent weeks"". âIn some cases there are very few passengers wearing masks on a bus, with those
who tend to still wear a mask being older."" Unions are warning that mask wearing on public transport has dropped significantly since it no longer became a legal requirement in England in July. The proportion of people using face coverings at major railway stations is estimated to have slumped from around 80% to around 20%. A government spokesperson said the lifting of restrictions relied on people taking ""personal responsibility"". ""The guidance is clear that people are expected and recommended to wear a mask when they come into contact with people they donât normally meet in enclosed and crowded spaces. âIt is open to transport operators to decide if they want to implement their own policies, working within their particular environment.â Transport for London (TfL), in keeping with many other operators, still require members of the public to wear a mask when travelling. âCovid is still with us and we all have a role to play in doing the right thing and keeping each other safe,"" said Siwan Hayward, Director of Policing and Compliance for TfL ""Wearing a face covering on our services and in our stations is still required under TfLâs condition of carriage,"" she said. She added that ""more than 500 uniformed officers"" were enforcing mask wearing on the network and ""non-exempt customers who fail to comply may be refused travel"".  Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Ben Wallace says processes for correspondence have been ""changed"" after this ""unacceptable level of service"" Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has said it would be an understatement to say he was angered by a data breach involving the email addresses of dozens of Afghan interpreters who worked for UK forces. More than 250 people seeking relocation to the UK - many of whom are in hiding - were mistakenly copied into an email. Mr Wallace has apologised to them, and launched an investigation. One person has been suspended, he said. The MoD has also referred itself to the Information Commissioner's Office. Speaking in the Commons, Mr Wallace said: ""I apologise to those Afghans affected by this data breach and with Home (the Home Office) we are now working with them to provide security advice. ""It is an unacceptable level of service that has let down the thousands of members of the armed forces and veterans. ""On behalf of the Ministry of Defence, I apologise."" He added that armed forces minister James Heappey was in the region speaking to neighbouring states to see what more could be done. 'Betrayed': The Afghans who feel left behind Life under Taliban rule one month on Veteran's joy at seeing Afghan interpreter in UK Stay home, female Kabul government workers told The email was sent to interpreters who remain in Afghanistan or have been able to get to other countries. Their email addresses could be seen by all recipients, showing people's names and some associated profile pictures. The Information Commissioner (ICO), which has the power to issue enforcement notices and fines in the most serious cases, is already making enquiries with the MoD. A spokesperson for the watchdog said people rightly expected their personal information to be handled securely especially where its loss could have devastating consequences, including possible threat to life. Conservative MP Tobias Ellwood, who chairs the defence select committee, warned that the Taliban had not changed. ""We must get these interpreters out or they'll be hunted and killed,"" he told MPs, and suggested using ""clandestine means"" to get them to safety, if usual methods were unavailable. ""All means will be explored,"" Mr Wallace replied. British forces were in Afghanistan for about 20 years The email was sent by the team in charge of the UK's Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy (Arap), which has been in contact with them since the Taliban took control of the country last month. The team told the interpreters it was doing everything it could to help relocate them. It also said they should not put themselves or their families at risk if it was not safe for them to leave their current location. But one interpreter who received the email realised that more than 250 Afghans who worked with British forces had been copied into the email. ""This mistake could cost the life of interpreters, especially for those who are still in Afghanistan,"" they told the BBC. ""Some of the interpreters didn't notice the mistake and they replied to all the emails already and they explained their situation which is very dangerous. The email contains their profile pictures and contact details."" The MoD then sent another email 30 minutes later with the title ""Urgent - Arap case contact"" asking the recipients to delete the previous email and warning ""your email address may have been compromised"". It recommended the interpreters change their email addresses. Mr Wallace said the Ministry of Defence believed there were 900 ""credible cases"" for Arap resettlement still in Afghanistan beyond the 311 the government is currently speaking to. Labour shadow defence secretary John Healey welcomed the defence secretary's apology but told the Commons that action now mattered most. He told MPs: ""These Afghan interpreters worked alongside our British forces and the government rightly pledged to protect them. Ministers must make good on those promises now."" Ahmad, not his real name, is one of the 250 or so whose names were mistakenly shared by the MoD. In 2011, he was shot by the Taliban while working as an interpreter with British troops in Helmand. He's currently in hiding in Afghanistan, living apart from his wife and baby daughter for their own safety. He told the BBC he was really shocked and disappointed when he spotted the MoD's mistake. ""Just when you think it can't get worse than this, along comes the Arap team and does something that proves you wrong. I didn't really expect this from them,"" he said. ""I'm 100% sure that it will have a negative impact on our safety because you know that we are already displaced from our home town. ""Now we have to change our locations again and we have to change our email addresses."" Ahmad added that he now doubted whether he would ever get to safety in the UK. ""I'm not very optimistic, because when I see their carelessness and their neglect, I don't think we're going to be in the UK in the near future."" But he said he was clinging to hope that the UK would ""finally do the right thing"". Have you been affected by the issues raised in this story? Tell us by emailing:haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

"The cost of protecting customers from failing energy providers could lead to higher bills, the boss of the energy regulator Ofgem has told the BBC. It comes as energy firm Green said it was on the brink of collapse due to soaring wholesale gas prices. ""As underlying costs rise, pressure on bills does go up"", Jonathan Brearley, Ofgem chief executive said. The government has said it is looking at lending money to bigger firms to help them take on stranded customers. If an energy firm collapses, customers are automatically switched to a tariff provided by the new supplier. This is a tariff agreed with the regulator Ofgem, but it may well be more expensive than the deal they had with the former company which went bust. Mr Brearley said protecting customers of failed energy firms was the regulator's ""number one priority"". However, he said it was too early to predict how expensive it would be to ensure that they were transferred to other suppliers in an orderly way. Peter McGirr, founder and chief executive of Green, told the BBC it had appointed a restructuring firm in an attempt to survive the current crisis. Mr McGirr said the firm was in ""deep, deep trouble and our heads are unlikely to bob back to the surface"". Is the UK headed for a gas shortage this winter? What happens if my energy supplier goes bust? Why are gas prices rising? Green has 180 staff based in Newcastle upon Tyne and has 250,000 UK customers. Mr McGirr said the appointment of Alvarez and Marsal was currently on an ""advisory and restructuring"" basis, but admitted Green could fall into administration within weeks. ""We need to try to hold on long enough to get some support"", he added. The company has been in discussions with the government and energy regulator Ofgem, but has not been offered any support. Mr McGirr said he believed the larger energy suppliers had too much influence in the crisis talks being held with government and said the big companies had an interest in more of the smaller suppliers going to the wall. Asked whether these costs would be met by the taxpayer, or spread across all energy customers' bills, he said: ""We have to first of all make sure that customers are transferred and looked after and then as we see the market evolve we will understand better the cost implications."" Customers on some tariffs are protected from sudden hikes in wholesale gas prices through the energy price cap, which limits how much firms can charge per unit of gas. The price cap covers 15 million households across England, Wales and Scotland. Mr Brearley said it was too early to predict how much the energy price cap would rise next year. So far, four energy firms have gone to the wall, including People's Energy and Utility Point, and four more are expected to follow in the coming days. Industry sources fear there may be as few as 10 energy suppliers left by the end of the year, down from 70 in January. But Mr Brearley predicted that a number of small suppliers would survive the current crisis, as well as larger ones, maintaining a diverse market with plenty of choice for consumers. When asked if Ofgem was ""asleep at the wheel"" and should have prevented suppliers from making promises to customers which they wouldn't be able to keep if prices rose, Mr Brearley replied: ""No - we have always protected customers interests and we work very closely with the companies. ""We work closely with all companies to assess their financial position. And if they need to exit the market we have well-rehearsed systems and processes to manage that."" Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng earlier denied that failed energy companies would get government bailouts, saying: ""I do not think it's the right thing for taxpayers' money to be injected into companies that have been badly run."" However, he said the government was exploring the possibility of lending money to bigger energy firms to help them absorb the cost of taking on new customers from companies that had gone bust. ""If we do have this policy, they will be expected to pay back the loans,"" he added. Mr Kwarteng alsowarned many UK households could face a ""very difficult winter"",with fuel prices surging and the Â£20-a-week temporary uplift in universal credit due to end in October. How could the CO2 shortage hit food supplies? Farmers fear gas price crisis may spark pig cull The government and Ofgem have both dismissed suggestions that the cap on energy prices would be lifted ahead of an agreed 12% rise in October, saying that keeping it was the ""clear and agreed position"". The price cap is reviewed twice a year. It applies only to standard variable or default tariffs. These types of tariff are typically the most expensive plan that a supplier offers. When fixed energy deals expire, as they generally do after one or two years, customers are likely to be put on these tariffs. Customers will still continue to receive gas or electricity even if the energy supplier goes bust. Ofgem will move your account to a new supplier, but it may take a few weeks. Your new supplier should then contact you to explain what is happening with your account While you wait to hear from your new supplier: check your current balance and - if possible - download any bills; take a photo of your meter reading If you pay by direct debit, there is no need to cancel it straight away, Citizens Advice says. Wait until your new account is set up before you cancel it If you are in credit, your money is protected and you'll be paid back. If you were in debt to the old supplier, you'll still have to pay the money back to your new supplier instead Read more about the next best steps to take here. Mr Brearley said the industry had seen ""an unprecedented rise in gas prices"". ""They are almost four times what they normally are and that would put any industry under strain,"" he added. The government and Ofgem say the UK does not have gas supply problems because of a diverse range of sources ""that can more than meet demand"". However, energy bills are facing particular pressures in Great Britain because of a dip in renewable energy supplies due to low wind, as well as the outage of a power cable supplying electricity from France. The International Energy Agency has called on Russia to supply more gas to Europe, saying ""it could do more to increase gas availability to Europe and ensure storage is filled to adequate levels"", in preparation for the winter. It added: ""Based on the available information, Russia is fulfilling its long-term contracts with European counterparts - but its exports to Europe are down from their 2019 level. ""This is also an opportunity for Russia to underscore its credentials as a reliable supplier to the European market."" Stacey Stothard is waiting to see how much more she will have to pay Stacey Stothard followed all the advice. Aware that energy prices were rising, she shopped around to find a decent fixed deal for her gas and electricity. She saved Â£300 - or so she thought. Her new energy supplier went bust and now she will be switched automatically to another one, and she is facing much higher bills, potentially amounting to hundreds of pounds more a year. ""It is just like watching the meter go up and up,"" she says. ""I did the right thing - not going for the cheapest deal, but choosing a company with a decent customer service record.""

"Children struggling with mental health problems during the pandemic are facing ""agonisingly"" long waits for treatment, a BBC investigation has found. Data from half of England's services found one in five seen in the past year waited over 12 weeks for care. The situation has got so bad that parents and head teachers told the BBC they had lost faith in the system. And doctors reported distressed children were ending up at A&E as they had no where else to go. Dr Catherine Hayhurst, from the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said in many cases hospitals have been left with no option but to admit youngsters on to general wards, even though they cannot be provided with specialist mental health support there. ""Children are distressed and agitated. It's difficult to manage on the wards,"" she said. NHS England acknowledged the pandemic had been very difficult for children and young people, but it said it was in the process of significantly expanding access to services to ensure they received quick access to care. How has coronavirus affected mental health? Looking after your mental health in a pandemic Sue Peacock's teenage daughter suffers from severe anxiety and has self-harmed. She has been waiting for treatment since before the pandemic began. Ms Peacock said the situation has made her daughter feel depressed and start to become violent. ""We don't know how long it's going to be before she receives help. ""That feeling of helplessness, I can't even describe how awful as a parent it is to see that. ""You're waiting for a service that you know can help your child."" Specialist care is provided by a network known as Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS). These teams include psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses and social workers who support children with conditions ranging from anxiety and depression to schizophrenia. During 2020-21, they saw 420,000 children and young people - although an estimated 1.5 million under-18s are thought to have a mental health disorder. The waits they faced are not routinely published. But the BBC obtained data under the Freedom of Information Act from 46 of England's services, half of the total, covering just over 250,000 under 18s. The figures from April 2020 to March 2021 showed: Half of those who were seen waited longer than four weeks A fifth waited more than 12 weeks The average wait was more than two months - although in some areas it topped eight A third of the trusts also provided data on youngsters still waiting for treatment, with the numbers doubling since the end of the first lockdown in June 2020. There are signs that waiting times have improved since before the pandemic. But this is likely to be down to a drop in people coming forward for help in the first lockdown, helping services tackle the backlog in those waiting for treatment. The BBC has also been told some services closed their waiting lists altogether, meaning the true extent of the waits may be undercounted. Head teacher Michelle Catterson has lost faith with child mental health services because of the waits. She runs Moon Hall School in Surrey, which teaches children aged seven to 16 with dyslexia. ""The pandemic has been really difficult for children. But the support is just not there when they need it,"" Ms Catterson said. ""Services are completely overwhelmed as things stand currently. ""When I have parents that are in a really desperate situation, I'm often reluctant to refer them because I know the length of time that they'll have to wait, and sometimes there just isn't that opportunity to wait. ""You need that support right there, right then, to try and help the child and the family."" Emma Thomas, chief executive of the YoungMinds charity, said it was clear the waits young people were facing were ""agonising"". ""We have seen a big rise in referrals to mental health services and, as this data shows, it's clear they have been struggling to cope. The pandemic has had a huge impact on young people's mental health, exacerbating existing pressures and creating new ones. ""The young people we work with have told us that they have struggled with isolation, loneliness and concerns about the future, whilst those that experienced trauma during the lockdowns, or were already experiencing inequalities, are likely to be disproportionately affected,"" she said. NHS England said it was investing in services, which by 2023 would help support another 345,000 children and young people - on top of the 420,000 being seen currently. This includes the rollout of school mental health teams which are designed to provide earlier support to children than CAMHS services. A spokeswoman for NHS England said: ""There is no doubt that the pandemic has turned children and young people's lives upside down.""

"This video can not be played Tim Davie: ""I think we've got a real battle on our hands, I walk a tightrope every day on this, but we've got to fight for it."" It is harder than ever for the BBC to maintain impartiality amid the ""culture wars"" and a polarisation of online views, its director general has said. The corporation has ""done it pretty well for 99 years"" and still is, Tim Davie has told a committee of MPs. ""I just think it's tougher now, by the way,"" he said on Tuesday. ""I think the culture wars are raging, I think we've got a real battle on our hands. ""I walk a tightrope every day on this, but we've got to fight for it."" Impartiality is ""sacrosanct"", said Mr Davie, whose headaches over the issue since taking over a year ago have ranged from ruling onwhether Newsnight's Emily Maitlis should have shared a tweet from Piers Morganabout the government's response to the pandemic, towhether staff can attend Pride marches. The BBC is ""nothing if it's not a good facilitator of proper open debate and diverse views"", he told the House of Commons media select committee. ""I think that's essential to us. It's mission critical. It's us, and it puts you in a very different place to where the rest of the world is heading in my view, which is a dangerous place around partial media. ""I and others feel very passionately about this. We're in a battle for this, and I think we need to really be clear that we're not perfect. We've got plenty of work to do to facilitate a space where we can properly debate these issues."" He said the BBC must hire people from across the political spectrum, even if they know they must leave their personal views at the door. The hearing came after the appointment of former HuffPost UK editorJess Brammar to a senior role in BBC News, despite a row over old tweets that were critical of Brexit and the government. BBC director of newsFran Unsworth announced her resignationshortly before Ms Brammar was appointed executive editor of BBC news channels, but Mr Davie said her decision to leave had ""nothing to do with the latest incident"". He added: ""I just saw a senior hire in [BBC] online going to someone from The Daily Telegraph. We need to hire the best as the BBC and we need to hire across the political spectrum."" Referring to the choice of Ms Brammar, he said: ""That is an incredibly important precedent and this affair is dangerous territory for us, not because of the process, but if people begin doubting our ability to hire people with [political] views into the BBC, and when they get here they leave them at the door."" Mr Davie also warned that the corporation was losing stars in a ""red hot"" battle with rivals and streaming services. ""We're in an incredibly inflationary market,"" he said. ""And we have lost people. Graham Norton has gone to Virgin Radio, and we've lost people to GB News, to LBC and other places. They're being poached."" Michaela Coel won an Emmy Award for her BBC drama I May Destroy You on Sunday He also referred to Fleabag creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge, whosigned an exclusive deal with Amazon Prime. Michaela Coel, however,has spoken about rejecting $1m (Â£730,000) from Netflixfor her acclaimed drama I May Destroy You because the BBC offered her more creative control. ""Life is not just about money,"" Mr Davie said. ""It's also about the creative experience you get. It's about making Normal People, it's about making something wonderful in drama or some of the documentaries [and] that ability to actually be on BBC One and have a big audience. ""So I wouldn't be too depressed about it. Having said that, I think, over time, there will be increasing pressure on us."" Mr Davie was also asked about former BBC correspondent Martin Bashir, whowas found to have acted ""deceitfully""to gain his 1995 interview with Princess Diana. That scandal has also put the spotlight on his other work, including an investigation into the 1986 murders of two girls. Michelle Hadaway, the mother of one of the victims, has said Bashir took her daughter Karen's clothesbut did not do the promised DNA testing or return the clothing. Martin Bashir has told BBC bosses he doesn't know what happened to the clothes ""We are extremely sorry for the distress this has caused Ms Hadaway,"" Mr Davie said. ""It's very distressing that we haven't been able to give her answers in terms of what happened to that clothing, and I'm appalled that that got lost. It's a very serious issue."" BBC sorry over loss of murdered girl's clothes A new attempt to find them has not yielded results, he said. ""With a slightly heavy heart, we're at a point where we are where we are, which is the clothingâ¦ and we have talked directly to Martin Bashir rather than through any agent. ""He doesn't know where the clothes are. I didn't speak to himâ¦ but he just doesn't know where the clothes are. Any other evidence coming to us, of course, we will proactively look at.""

"The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine should be accepted under new US travel rules, White House medical adviser Dr Anthony Fauci says A ban on UK and EU travellers will lift in early November Fully-jabbed passengers can enter the US if they take a Covid test before travelling But precise details are yet to be ironed out - including eligible vaccines Children struggling with mental health problems in the pandemic are facing ""agonisingly long"" waits for help More than 100 military personnel prepare to help the Scottish Ambulance Service amid soaring demand Government borrowing falls as Covid curbs continue to ease in UK Single Covid case throws a Chinese city of 10 million into lockdown UK records 31,564 new cases and further 203 deaths on Tuesday Edited by George Bowden That's all from us today - the live page will be back again tomorrow morning. Your writers today were Doug Faulkner and Victoria Lindrea. Your editor was George Bowden. Thanks for joining us. More than 100 military personnel are set to come to the aid of the Scottish Ambulance Service. The UK government said 114 drivers and support staff would be deployed in Scotland from Saturday, along with a further 111 to operate mobile testing units. ""Our armed forces are once again stepping up, demonstrating their versatility as we support the Covid-19 response across the UK,"" said Defence Secretary Ben Wallace. ""We are proud to work alongside the dedicated men and women at the Scottish Ambulance Service as they continue to provide a lifesaving service to the people of Scotland."" The announcement from Westminster came minutes after Scotland's Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said 88 drivers and 15 support staff could be called in. Yousaf also announced a boost of Â£20 million to the ambulance service budget. Read more here. We're closing the live page soon - but before we go, here is a re-cap of the main coronavirus developments this Tuesday:  Vaccine uptake has slowed dramatically since the summer as figures show. On Monday - which saw the start of vaccinations for 12-15-year-olds in England and Scotland - 24,684 first jabs were given and 46,451 second doses were administered across the UK. Meanwhile daily deaths are rising - 203 deaths were recorded on Tuesday. Case numbers, though, are still falling, despite schools returning in both England and Wales at the start of this month. As we mentioned earlier, the firsthealthy 12 to 15-year-olds in England and Scotland began receiving Covid jabsthis week. Invites are also being sent out in Wales this week, while in Northern Ireland teen vaccinations are likely to start in October. Across the UK pupils this age are being offered a single Pfizer dose to help limit further disruption to their education. Most will receive the jab in a school setting. Evidence suggests a single dose cuts the risk of catching the Delta variant by about 55%. So will pupils still be encouraged to take lateral flow tests at home - and what happens if they test positive? And what about face coverings, social distancing and ventilation of school buildings? Everything you need to knowis here. Passes will be compulsory for those aged over 18 to enter certain events. Covid passes should be approved by the Senedd before they become compulsory, say opposition parties in Wales. From 11 October, people attending big events and nightclubs in Wales must show they are fully vaccinated or have tested negative in the previous 48 hours. The Welsh government has the powers to change the law, but the Conservatives and Plaid Cymru say Members of the Senedd (MSs) should get a vote first. Conservative shadow health minister Russell George said the Welsh government should make sure there is ""a vote in the Senedd prior to any proposed introduction and that the full details are given to members"". Plaid Cymru said it had ""consistently argued that coronavirus regulations should be agreed in the Senedd before coming into force"". Read morehere. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent There were fears September would see cases start to take
off. The return of more normal mixing patterns with schools back
and people going into the office would â some predicted â lead to a new surge. We are now two-thirds of the way through the month and the
opposite has happened â cases have fallen. Dig beneath the headline figures and there is a little more
volatility, Scotland has seen a rapid rise, but that appears to have peaked. This is now translating to falling numbers in hospital
overall â a trend which is likely to continue for the rest of the month. Deaths are averaging close to 150 a day. That may seem a
lot, but it is worth pointing out that it is similar to what you would see for
months on end during a bad flu winter. The big question now though is what happens next as the
nights draw in. There is uncertainty, but the longer cases remain in check
the more hope it gives us that UK has truly reached an equilibrium whereby the
amount of immunity built up through vaccination and natural infection is enough
to keep the virus at bay while society returns to normal. A young offender institution is declaring itself a Covid-19 ""outbreak site"" after""a high number"" of inmates tested positive for the virus. HMYOI Aylesbury, in Buckinghamshire, houses boys and men aged between 17 and 21. In a tweet it says it has ""restricted the regime"" on one wing ""as Covid has returned to the prison"". An HM Prison Service spokesman says precautionary measures are being taken at the institution in line with public health guidance. HMYOI Aylesbury says on Twitter: ""Unfortunately we have had to restrict the regime on one of our wings as Covid has returned to the prison with a high number of prisoners testing positive. ""We are now classed as an outbreak site. ""We are sorry for any impact this has on you and your loved ones as we try to contain the virus."" A further 203 deaths, among people who tested positive  for coronavirus over the past 28 days, have been reported in the UK, according tothe government's latest figures,external. In addition, 31,564 new cases were reported in the past 24 hours. In his first address to the United Nations, and against the backdrop of a once-in-a-century pandemic, US President Joe Bidenpledges cooperation with allies through ""a decisive decade for our world"". ""I believe we must work together like never before,"" he says. In the context of Covid and the growing climate crisis - both of which have sharpened global divides - Biden pushes for cooperation, saying: ""Our own success is bound up in others succeeding as well."" The 76th General Assembly in New York City is currently taking place. While the UK government announced last week plans to scrap PCR tests for returning, fully-jabbed, international travellers to England, Wales' first minister saysthis is a ""step away"" from a duty to people's health. Mark Drakeford says ministers in Wales face a ""difficult decision"" - with the nation not yet having decided whether to follow England. He says the tests allow scientists to detect new variants of the virus. From 1 October, for travellers to England, PCR tests will no longer be required on day two and this will be replaced instead by a cheaper lateral flow test. Concerns have also beenraised in Scotlandabout the change to the testing regime. Drakeford says the ""most concerning"" decision is moving away from PCR tests on day two, ""because that was the strongest defence against the re-importation of viruses from elsewhere in the world"". ""In Wales we genomic sequence a higher proportion of tests than any other part of the United Kingdom and it is that sequencing that allows the very skilled scientists who do it to identify new variations in coronavirus,"" he says. However the fact that many Welsh travellers travel to the UK via England made it a ""difficult decision"", with English ports not keen to communicate differences in rules. Simon Clarke, Conservative MP and chief secretary to the Treasury,  has defended the government decision to end the Covid Universal Credit uplift. The Â£20-a-weekincrease in Universal Credit is due to end in October,but many have criticised the government move at a time when prices and bills are rising for most households. ""All the evidence now points to a rebounding Labour market,"" Clarke tells the House of Commons. He refers to ONS figures last week ""which reported that [job] vacancies were at a record high"", adding that the unemployment rate fallen for seven consecutive months. ""People have been coming off the furlough scheme very rapidly now. Numbers are down from 5.1 million in January to 1.6 million at the end of July."" ""The furlough scheme has been absolutely essential to supporting the UK throughout this very difficult period. It has been an historic success."" But he adds: ""Broader economic growth has exceeded expectations as restrictions have been lifted."" And concludes: ""The best way to help vulnerable people is to provide them with the opportunities that they need for well-paid work."" Nadine with her brother Ash Cooper and her sister Victoria Cooper, the last time they were all together in 2019 Nadine Beasley, from Bournemouth, is one of those who have been waiting to visit her family in the US. Despite the change in travel rules she is going to miss her sisterâs wedding, for which she is maid of honour, by days. However, she will be reunited with her family at Christmas. ""My sister is getting married on 30 October in
California,"" she says. ""I was meant to be her maid of honour, my daughter a flowergirl. ""We
were due to fly out on 22 October, so we're naturally upset about the ban being
lifted in November, because we'll miss her wedding by days. ""However, we've now made our fourth rebooking since February
2020 to fly out on 20 December. So that means Christmas with my parents and my
siblings, who are all in California, which is better than the last 18 months of
waiting and knowing nothing."" With the travel ban she has not seen her siblings or parents for more than two years. She says it is annoying that she will miss her sister's wedding by days, having already missed her brother's but says the fact there is ""light at the end of the tunnel"" in the form of a date means it feels like ""a weightâs been lifted"". ""Weâre going with my nan. Itâs bittersweet because we lost
grandad,"" she adds. The UK government has borrowed record-breaking amounts to pay for measures designed to limit the impact of coronavirus. Government initiatives such as the furlough scheme are estimated to have cost up to Â£70bn by the time they come to an end on 30 September. And sadly it turns out there's no such thing as a magic money tree. So how much exactly has the government borrowed over the course of the pandemic, who has it borrowed from - and when does it have to be paid back? Find out here.

More than 16 million people have now downloaded the app, with more than 12 million in England doing so since 17 May when the Covid Pass feature to prove vaccination for events and foreign travel was added to it. Some 1.5 million people have now registered their organ donation decision through the platform, with 265,000 of those doing it via the app for the first time, according to the Department of Health and Social Care. Around 150,000 people registered their preference from May. It comes after a new ""opt-out"" organ donation system came into effect last year, known as Max and Keira's law.
The law is named after Keira Ball, who died aged nine in 2017, and Max Johnson, now aged 13, who was saved by her heart. The US will let fully vaccinated travellers from the UK - and many other countries - visit from November. The change in rules, follows a shake-up of England's travel regulations on Friday. Put simply, going overseas is becoming a little bit easier, although, as before, different rules apply for the devolved nations. So where and when can you go, what are the rules around vaccination - and what's happening with the so-called traffic light system which saw countries divided into red, amber and green categories? We have all the answershere.  Katherine SmithBBC News In England 59,000
pupils (0.7%) were absent from school in England at the end of last week
with a confirmed case of Covid, according to the latest Department for
Education attendance figures. A further 45,000 (0.5%) were absent due
to a suspected case. Some 2,000 pupils were absent due to
restrictions in place to manage a Covid outbreak. Fewer than 500 were absent
due to Covid-related school closures. At the end of last term in July, when
bubble systems were in place, more than a million children were absent for
Covid-related reasons. Those figures included 774,000 who were isolating due to
contact with a positive case in school and 81,000 who had a confirmed or
suspected case. A police photo shows the takeaway stash seized by officers New Zealand police have made a bizarre arrest after a pair of alleged gang associates were caught trying to enter Auckland with a boot full of Kentucky Fried Chicken - and tens of thousands of dollars. Under Auckland's strict Level 4 lockdown, all restaurants - including take-away services - remain closed. Police said the men, aged 23 and 30, had travelled from Hamilton, about 75 miles south of Auckland. A police spokesperson told the BBC that officers made the arrest after they noticed a suspicious-looking vehicle travelling on a gravel road on the outskirts of the city. After a chase, the vehicle was stopped and searched. Police located NZ$100,000 (US$70,000; Â£51,000) in cash, as well as at least three buckets of chicken, about 10 cups of coleslaw, a large pack of fries, and four large bags containing other KFC items. The spokesperson said that the men would appear in court for breaching public health rules later in the year - but added that further charges are also likely. The investigation is ongoing. Under New Zealand's tough anti-Covid laws, fines can reach up to NZ$4,000 and can even involve prison sentences of up to six months. Auckland will move to a Level 3 lockdown from midnight on Tuesday, but residents will remain confined to their homes unless they are attending school, work or shopping. As mask wearing on public transport continues to decline, transport unions have expressed concern that it would be difficult to
reintroduce the policy if the government decided to do so. Mike Lynch, general secretary of the RMT union said his
members had noticed a marked policy drift since the government changed the
rules in July. Even where mask wearing remains mandatory, many people were ignoring the rules, he said. He added: ""As more people see others failing to comply, the situation will escalate quickly over the autumn."" ""With the government already making compulsory
mask wearing on transport a contingency if cases escalate in the coming weeks,
there is a real danger they won't be able to get the genie back into the
bottle."" Mick Whelan, general secretary of train driversâ union Aslef, agreed there had been ""a decline, in recent days"" even where mask-wearing is ostensibly required. âWe believe mask wearing should be mandatory on
trains.To protect
passengers and staff and to control the Covid-19 pandemic."" A spokesperson for Unite. which represents bus drivers, said mask wearing was ""collapsing - and has got much worse in
recent weeks"". âIn some cases there are very few passengers wearing masks on a bus, with those
who tend to still wear a mask being older."" Unions are warning that mask wearing on public transport has dropped significantly since it no longer became a legal requirement in England in July. The proportion of people using face coverings at major railway stations is estimated to have slumped from around 80% to around 20%. A government spokesperson said the lifting of restrictions relied on people taking ""personal responsibility"". ""The guidance is clear that people are expected and recommended to wear a mask when they come into contact with people they donât normally meet in enclosed and crowded spaces. âIt is open to transport operators to decide if they want to implement their own policies, working within their particular environment.â Transport for London (TfL), in keeping with many other operators, still require members of the public to wear a mask when travelling. âCovid is still with us and we all have a role to play in doing the right thing and keeping each other safe,"" said Siwan Hayward, Director of Policing and Compliance for TfL ""Wearing a face covering on our services and in our stations is still required under TfLâs condition of carriage,"" she said. She added that ""more than 500 uniformed officers"" were enforcing mask wearing on the network and ""non-exempt customers who fail to comply may be refused travel"".  Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Watch: President Biden's first UN General Assembly speech In his first address to the United Nations, US President Joe Biden has urged global cooperation through ""a decisive decade for our world"". His calls for unity come amid tensions with allies over the US' Afghanistan withdrawal and a major diplomatic row with France over a submarine deal. The US also announced it was doubling its climate finance pledge by 2024. Reaffirming his support for democracy and diplomacy, Mr Biden said: ""We must work together like never before."" The 76th General Assembly in New York City takes place against the backdrop of a climate crisis and a once-in-a-century pandemic, both of which have sharpened global divides. Mr Biden pushed for cooperation on these fronts, saying: ""Whether we choose to fight for our shared future or not will reverberate for generations to come. Simply put, we stand, in my view, at an inflection point in history."" Mr Biden on Tuesday stressed that the US is ""not seeking a new Cold War or a world divided into rigid blocs"". The US, he said, ""is ready to work with any nation that steps up and pursues peaceful resolution to shared challenges, even if we have intense disagreements in other areas"". The remark appeared to be a response to UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, who this weekend warned the US and China were headed for ""a Cold War that would be different from the past one, and probably more dangerous and more difficult to manage"". The president also touted the pullout from Afghanistan, which has been criticised by allies at home and abroad, saying the US was ending a ""period of relentless war"" for a ""new era of relentless diplomacy"". Mr Biden offered a key pledge on climate finance as well, saying the US will increase funding for developing countries to $11.4bn (Â£8.3bn) by 2024. This means the US will offer just over half of the European Union's pledge to help poorer nations cope with climate change. Has climate pledge to poor countries been met? The developed world had pledged to provide these countries $100bn a year by 2020 but this has still not been achieved. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson - who is meeting with Mr Biden later on Tuesday - praised the ""massive contribution"" and said the US had ""stepped up to the plate"". At the end of his first address, Mr Biden promised that the US would lead ""with our allies"". ""We will lead on all the greatest challenges of our time, from Covid to climate, human dignity and human rights, but we will not go it alone,"" he said. World leaders at odds with former President Donald Trump had hoped for a more stable and reliable America under his successor's leadership - but Mr Biden's most recent foreign policy moves have made some uneasy. The US' lack of coordination during the Afghanistan exit after two decades of war rankled allies and led to an international scramble to evacuate. The Nato mission at the time of the withdrawal comprised troops from 36 countries, three-quarters of whom were non-American. How Europe's relationship with Joe Biden turned sour Last week, a trilateral US-UK deal to provide Australia with nuclear-powered submarines infuriated the French, who had their own five-year-old contract to build conventional submarines for the Australians. French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian described the agreement as ""a stab in the back"", and the top French diplomats in both countries were recalled. The Biden administration has also seen international criticism over alleged US hoarding of Covid-19 vaccines and non-reciprocal travel restrictions, as well as frugality with climate aid. After four years of America First and Donald Trump's isolationist nationalism, this was a speech the leaders of the liberal democracies wanted to cheer. But Joe Biden's first appearance before the UN General Assembly will be treated with a good deal of scepticism after America's shambolic departure from Afghanistan. That said, the US president was determined to push his more outward looking view of the world. And turning a page, he was able to say this was the first time in 20 years that America wasn't at war. British diplomats will have cheered his pledge to double to $11.4bn the money to tackle climate change by 2024 - something they have been lobbying the White House relentlessly on. One issue that enjoys bipartisan support in Washington is the threat posed by China - the driving force behind the new security partnership with Britain and Australia. He didn't mention the world's other superpower by name, but it's clear who he was talking about. The US president has had a torrid, horrid summer. This speech was an attempt to reassure America's international allies - and to put flesh on the bones of his claim that ""America is back"".

"The British food industry will be forced to pay five times more for carbon dioxide as part of a government deal with a US company to restart production in the UK. Environment Secretary George Eustice said carbon dioxide prices would rise from Â£200 per tonne to Â£1,000. The government has agreed to pay out tens of millions of pounds to CF Industries to reopen a plant in the UK. The closure had raised fears over food supplies and the nuclear industry. US-owned CF Industries recently shut two UK sites that produce 60% of the country's commercial carbon dioxide supplies, because of a sharp rise in gas prices. This video can not be played Ros Atkins on... the UK's rising energy bills Farms, food producers and supermarkets have warned that a shortage of carbon dioxide will lead to significant disruption to the manufacture and supply of fresh produce. The Times also reported,externalthat ministers were concerned that the UK might have to close its six advanced gas-cooled nuclear reactors, which also use CO2. The government announced late on Tuesday night that it would meet the full operating costs to run CF Industries' Billingham plant in Teesside for three weeks. The costs are expected to be in the ""low tens of millions"" and will be below Â£50m. Mr Eustice said that the deal with CF Industries ""will be not a loan, it will be a payment to underwrite some of their fixed costs"". At the end of the three-week period, it is hoped that the price of carbon dioxide will have risen sufficiently to make it economically viable for CF Industries to keep production running. Mr Eustice said the food industry would have to accept ""a big, sharp rise"" carbon dioxide prices from Â£200 to Â£1,000 a tonne. ""The critical thing was to get the production up and running expeditiously. That's why we've needed this government intervention,"" he said. ""But we've had meetings with the food industry. They all recognise that the price of carbon dioxide is going to increase substantially and when that price increases, then the market signal will be then for these plants to continue producing."" Mr Eustice insisted that the rise in cost would not have a ""significant impact"" on food prices. He said that while food prices were increasing ""due to global commodity prices, oil prices and also other factors such as labour shortages"", carbon dioxide was ""a tiny proportion"" of the industry's overall costs. CF Industries had halted two of its fertiliser factories - which produce carbon dioxide as a by-product - because of gas prices. Carbon dioxide is used in the slaughter of animals such as chickens CF Industries' Billingham plant will need up to three days to start producing new CO2. The company told the BBC it had ""no estimate"" on when its second UK plant at Ince in Cheshire would  resume production. The British Meat Processors Association said the deal to open CF Industries' Teesside plant was a ""huge relief"" and said it was now ""focused on re-establishing supplies before Friday this week, which is when around 25% of pork production was in danger of shutting down"". Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, welcomed the decision, but said the timetable to restart CF Industries' factory and begin producing carbon dioxide ""will still be tight"". He told the BBC's Today programme: ""Our understanding is that provided that carbon dioxide starts to get through to food producers by the end of the week, then we can avert major and significant disruption in our stores."" Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the ""exceptional short-term arrangement"" would ensure industries that rely on a stable supply of CO2 ""have the resources they require to avoid disruption"". He said: ""With regards to the CO2 situation, it was abundant, it was very cheap and I think a lot of people were surprised at what happened."" The government intends to publish the letter from Mr Kwarteng to Tony Will, chief executive of CF Industries, which sets out the terms of the taxpayer support. Commenting on the three-week deal, Mr Kwarteng said: ""In a critical intervention you have to have a way of exiting the arrangement. ""It is not a case of just trying to nationalise it or supporting it indefinitely, and that is why in the critical period we needed to have a short term arrangement I am confident that we can get other sources of CO2 in that period. Mr Eustice said that the shortage of carbon dioxide had been caused by a ""perfect storm"" of circumstances where CF Industries had shut its two plants because ""an increase in gas price means they are not profitable"", while two other providers had closed their sites for maintenance. But the British Meat Processors Association (BMPA) said the current difficulties showed how exposed the UK is, because of its reliance on such a small number of carbon dioxide producers. ""Over many years, we have had a major consolidation of the industry resulting in sectors like food and drink, nuclear and health being reliant on a very small number of very large suppliers,"" the BMPA said. ""If a market-based solution is to be found, it will likely involve longer-term higher prices for CO2, which will be sustainable for some, but not all users of the gas."" Ian Wright, the chief executive of the Food and Drink Federation, also called on the government to support other fertiliser producers and help food producers to look for alternatives to CO2. Mr Will, who flew from the US to the UK on Sunday to meet Mr Kwarteng, said: ""We look forward to working with Secretary Kwarteng and the UK government on developing a longer-term solution, including the development of alternative suppliers of CO2 for the UK market."" Farmers fear gas price crisis may spark pig cull How could the CO2 shortage hit food supplies? Gas price crisis: Government poised to step in The BBC understands that the deal with CF Industries has been drafted so that other companies who stop production because of high commodity prices will not be able to ask the government for similar help. Norwegian firm Yara has also cut production at a number of European factories, including one in Hull. This video can not be played The prime minister says he does ânot believe people will be short of foodâ amid reports of some empty supermarket shelves. Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged people not to worryabout putting food on the table this winter, amid rising energy and food bills and a cut to universal credit. Wholesale prices for gas have surged 250% since January, with a 70% rise since August alone, leading to calls for support from the industry and the collapse of some smaller energy firms. Mr Opie added that the government should also take action on other issues affecting food retailers in recent weeks, such as the shortage of HGV drivers, which has been exacerbated by the pandemic and many drivers returning to the European Union after Brexit. The government has been keen to stress that this is very much an emergency measure, time-limited, and with a cap on the amount it is prepared to pay. It had to do something. Food producers were warning that shortages would become apparent within days, at a time when supply chains have already been disrupted by other issues, such as a lack of lorry drivers. But the fact remains that it has agreed to give a large US-owned company tens of millions of pounds of taxpayers' money, just to operate one of its own plants. That isn't a particularly good look - and it has cast a glaring spotlight on the vulnerability of a key part of the economy. Now there is a three-week window for government, supermarkets and food producers to come up with a ""sustainable market-based solution"". In practice, that's likely to mean users paying more for their CO2, a cost which will ultimately be borne by consumers.

"This video can not be played The prime minister says he does ânot believe people will be short of foodâ amid reports of some empty supermarket shelves. Boris Johnson has said people should not worry about putting food on the table this winter, amid surging energy prices and a cut to universal credit. The prime minister told BBC News: ""I don't believe people will be short of food - and wages are actually rising."" It comes after Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng warned some households face a ""very difficult winter"". Energy and food bills are rising due to a spike in global gas prices - and many families face a Â£20-a-week benefit cut. The cost of protecting customers from failing energy providers could lead to higher bills,the boss of the energy regulator Ofgem has warned. Speaking to the BBC in New York, where he has been meeting world leaders at the United Nations, Mr Johnson said the surge in energy prices was a ""short-term"" problem caused by ""the global economy coming back to life"" after the coronavirus pandemic. Government to pay millions to restart CO2 supplies Is the UK headed for a gas shortage this winter? Gas price crisis: Government poised to step in Universal credit: When will the Â£20 increase stop? ""We are talking to the energy companies - doing what we can to keep prices low, to make sure that the supermarket shelves aren't empty,"" he said. Households across England, Scotland and Wales are set to see their energy bills rise by an average of Â£139 a year in October. Workers also face a rise in National Insurance payments from next April, to help fund higher costs for the NHS and social care. In his BBC interview, Mr Johnson insisted the gas price increase was an ""interim"" issue and the global energy markets would ""rectify themselves"". Some supermarket shoppers have been met with empty shelves It showed that the UK was right to be moving to renewable energy, he added. The government is hoping to limit further energy bill rises by keeping a price cap in place, and also plans to help bigger firms take on customers from small suppliers that have gone bust. Separately, the government says it has taken action to prevent supermarket shortages with a deal to restart production at CF Industries, the UK's biggest producer of carbon dioxide. The gas is widely used by the food industry to prolong shelf life. Restarting production at the carbon dioxide plants is set to cost taxpayers tens of millions of pounds, after the government agreed to meet the full operating costs for three weeks. Energy price rises have been as dizzying as New York's skyscrapers - but Boris Johnson was reluctant to acknowledge the squeeze on supply was anything more than a short-term problem. The government has managed to broker a deal on CO2, but the pressure points this autumn go beyond that. There are real fears at home about household bills, food supplies, and rising prices. But Mr Johnson blamed the pressures on the pandemic, saying the issues were just in the ""interim"". While he said the government would help where it could, he did not provide details of any further actions the government might take, placing his faith in the market to resolve the crunch and pointing to his energy ""ten-point plan"". A long-term Whitehall plan may not be that much comfort to those worrying about paying higher bills right here and now. Read more from Laura here. Mr Johnson has again rejected calls from Labour and many Tory MPs to scrap the cut to the Â£20 a week top-up to universal credit, which some MPs have warnedwill push many working families into poverty. Instead of keeping the top-up, which was brought in to help people through the pandemic, Mr Johnson said:  ""We think the best thing we can do is help people into high-skilled, high wage jobs, that is what is happening, ""Unemployment is falling very rapidly, jobs are being created, wages are rising. ""And rather than raising people's taxes to put more money into benefits, we want to see companies paying their workers more."" Labour held a debate in the Commons, calling on the government to halt the proposed cut to the universal credit top-up. The party's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Bridget Phillipson, said working families faced a squeeze on living standards this winter ""on a scale not seen for a generation"" - and it was down to government decisions, not an ""unforeseeable series of unhappy accidents"". ""Incomes are coming down, prices are going up - especially energy prices - taxes are going up, rents are going up, childcare costs are going up, fuel costs are going up, rail fares are going up. ""And with empty shelves in too many shops, restaurants closing because of meat shortages, and now refrigerant shortages putting Christmas at risk, it isn't just that people can afford less, there is also less to afford,"" she told MPs. Speaking on BBC Two's Newsnight programme on Monday, the Conservative former Brexit Secretary, David Davis, warned there was a risk of a ""cost of living crisis"" for new Tory voters such as ""the plumber, the bricklayer, the lorry driver"". He said his advice to Chancellor Rishi Sunak would be: ""You think hard about the ordinary family's take-home pay and what they have to buy with it, because that will be a dictator of how people feel going in to the new year.""

"Government borrowing was higher than expected in August as debt interest payments rose due to higher inflation. Borrowing, which is the difference between tax income and spending, was Â£20.5bn,official figures show,external- Â£5.5bn lower than in August last year. However, it was still the second-highest figure for August since records began. Economists had expected government borrowing to be about Â£15bn. Borrowing has been at record levels, with billions being spent by the government on measures such as the furlough scheme to support the economy. This high spending, combined with less money coming into the exchequer due to the pandemic and a fall in economic output, has pushed government debt up to more than Â£2.2 trillion, or about 97.6% of GDP - a level not seen since the early 1960s. The interest payments on government debt were Â£6.3bn in August. That was Â£2.9bn more than in August 2020, but lower than the monthly record of Â£8.7bn in June 2021. Coronavirus: Where does the government borrow billions from? Price rises see record jump as food costs soar Danni Hewson, a financial analyst at AJ Bell, said: ""Inflation is not just something that's making us wince when we get to the supermarket checkout, it's also taking its toll on the public purse. ""Interest payments on all that debt shot up in August and September will be even more painful"". The government borrowed a total of Â£325.1bn in the financial year to March, which amounts to 15.5% of GDP, the highest percentage since the end of World War Two. The figure was an increase of Â£27.1bn compared with the previous Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimate, which was largely due to the expected cost of Â£20.9bn on guarantees on loans to firms that will not be able to pay back. Isabel Stockton, research economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, noted that this estimate suggested that non-repayments would total just over a quarter of the Â£80bn loaned out. ""This is a big number, but not as big as feared by the Office for Budget Responsibility whose Budget 2021 estimate was that Â£27bn would not be recouped,"" she said. Ms Stockton added that for the public spending figures, the precise size of last year's spike in borrowing ""is not all that important"". ""What matters more are the strength of the eventual recovery, whether current strength in tax receipts persists into future years and whether the large income tax, corporation tax, and National Insurance tax rises announced since March are actually implemented as planned."" While borrowing this year is coming into land better than the gloomy forecasts of the OBR, in August it was still higher than expected, and the second highest on record. It was the direct impact of rising inflation on borrowing costs that drove the figures. While the chancellor is still heading for some extra room for manoeuvre ahead of next month's Budget and Spending Review, there is also some room for reflection in the revision to last year's borrowing numbers. The post war record for borrowing last year was revised up substantially to Â£325bn, driven by more than Â£20bnn in expected losses on government-backed Covid contingency loans. This is a significant sum, about a quarter of such loans, reflecting the hidden extent of corporate distress. Though this figure is lower than some original estimates of write-offs. The ongoing economic recovery will also help ensure this figure does not rise further. Chancellor Rishi Sunak is due to deliver a new Budget and growth forecasts on 27 October, as well as new multi-year spending limits for individual government departments. Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist for Capital Economics, said: ""With the chancellor intent on signalling in his Budget on 27 October that the fiscal stimulus seen since the pandemic is now firmly at an end, the big fiscal boost to the economy last year will soon become a fiscal drag."" She said that while tax revenues of Â£61.2bn were higher that last August's Â£55.8bn, government spending was ""elevated"" in August, including Â£1.1bn on the furlough scheme as well as Â£2.1bn on the self-employment income support scheme. However, she added that the figures showed that ""the government's financial position isn't as bad as the Office for Budget Responsibility predicted back in March"".

""Our armed forces are once again stepping up, demonstrating their versatility as we support the Covid-19 response across the UK,"" said Defence Secretary Ben Wallace.

Yousaf also announced a boost of Â£20 million to the ambulance service budget. Read more here. We're closing the live page soon - but before we go, here is a re-cap of the main coronavirus developments this Tuesday:  Vaccine uptake has slowed dramatically since the summer as figures show. On Monday - which saw the start of vaccinations for 12-15-year-olds in England and Scotland - 24,684 first jabs were given and 46,451 second doses were administered across the UK. Meanwhile daily deaths are rising - 203 deaths were recorded on Tuesday. Case numbers, though, are still falling, despite schools returning in both England and Wales at the start of this month. As we mentioned earlier, the firsthealthy 12 to 15-year-olds in England and Scotland began receiving Covid jabsthis week. Invites are also being sent out in Wales this week, while in Northern Ireland teen vaccinations are likely to start in October. Across the UK pupils this age are being offered a single Pfizer dose to help limit further disruption to their education. Most will receive the jab in a school setting. Evidence suggests a single dose cuts the risk of catching the Delta variant by about 55%. So will pupils still be encouraged to take lateral flow tests at home - and what happens if they test positive? And what about face coverings, social distancing and ventilation of school buildings? Everything you need to knowis here. Passes will be compulsory for those aged over 18 to enter certain events. Covid passes should be approved by the Senedd before they become compulsory, say opposition parties in Wales. From 11 October, people attending big events and nightclubs in Wales must show they are fully vaccinated or have tested negative in the previous 48 hours. The Welsh government has the powers to change the law, but the Conservatives and Plaid Cymru say Members of the Senedd (MSs) should get a vote first. Conservative shadow health minister Russell George said the Welsh government should make sure there is ""a vote in the Senedd prior to any proposed introduction and that the full details are given to members"". Plaid Cymru said it had ""consistently argued that coronavirus regulations should be agreed in the Senedd before coming into force"". Read morehere. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent There were fears September would see cases start to take
off. The return of more normal mixing patterns with schools back
and people going into the office would â some predicted â lead to a new surge. We are now two-thirds of the way through the month and the
opposite has happened â cases have fallen. Dig beneath the headline figures and there is a little more
volatility, Scotland has seen a rapid rise, but that appears to have peaked. This is now translating to falling numbers in hospital
overall â a trend which is likely to continue for the rest of the month. Deaths are averaging close to 150 a day. That may seem a
lot, but it is worth pointing out that it is similar to what you would see for
months on end during a bad flu winter. The big question now though is what happens next as the
nights draw in. There is uncertainty, but the longer cases remain in check
the more hope it gives us that UK has truly reached an equilibrium whereby the
amount of immunity built up through vaccination and natural infection is enough
to keep the virus at bay while society returns to normal. A young offender institution is declaring itself a Covid-19 ""outbreak site"" after""a high number"" of inmates tested positive for the virus. HMYOI Aylesbury, in Buckinghamshire, houses boys and men aged between 17 and 21. In a tweet it says it has ""restricted the regime"" on one wing ""as Covid has returned to the prison"". An HM Prison Service spokesman says precautionary measures are being taken at the institution in line with public health guidance. HMYOI Aylesbury says on Twitter: ""Unfortunately we have had to restrict the regime on one of our wings as Covid has returned to the prison with a high number of prisoners testing positive. ""We are now classed as an outbreak site. ""We are sorry for any impact this has on you and your loved ones as we try to contain the virus."" A further 203 deaths, among people who tested positive  for coronavirus over the past 28 days, have been reported in the UK, according tothe government's latest figures,external. In addition, 31,564 new cases were reported in the past 24 hours. In his first address to the United Nations, and against the backdrop of a once-in-a-century pandemic, US President Joe Bidenpledges cooperation with allies through ""a decisive decade for our world"". ""I believe we must work together like never before,"" he says. In the context of Covid and the growing climate crisis - both of which have sharpened global divides - Biden pushes for cooperation, saying: ""Our own success is bound up in others succeeding as well."" The 76th General Assembly in New York City is currently taking place. While the UK government announced last week plans to scrap PCR tests for returning, fully-jabbed, international travellers to England, Wales' first minister saysthis is a ""step away"" from a duty to people's health. Mark Drakeford says ministers in Wales face a ""difficult decision"" - with the nation not yet having decided whether to follow England. He says the tests allow scientists to detect new variants of the virus. From 1 October, for travellers to England, PCR tests will no longer be required on day two and this will be replaced instead by a cheaper lateral flow test. Concerns have also beenraised in Scotlandabout the change to the testing regime. Drakeford says the ""most concerning"" decision is moving away from PCR tests on day two, ""because that was the strongest defence against the re-importation of viruses from elsewhere in the world"". ""In Wales we genomic sequence a higher proportion of tests than any other part of the United Kingdom and it is that sequencing that allows the very skilled scientists who do it to identify new variations in coronavirus,"" he says. However the fact that many Welsh travellers travel to the UK via England made it a ""difficult decision"", with English ports not keen to communicate differences in rules. Simon Clarke, Conservative MP and chief secretary to the Treasury,  has defended the government decision to end the Covid Universal Credit uplift. The Â£20-a-weekincrease in Universal Credit is due to end in October,but many have criticised the government move at a time when prices and bills are rising for most households. ""All the evidence now points to a rebounding Labour market,"" Clarke tells the House of Commons. He refers to ONS figures last week ""which reported that [job] vacancies were at a record high"", adding that the unemployment rate fallen for seven consecutive months. ""People have been coming off the furlough scheme very rapidly now. Numbers are down from 5.1 million in January to 1.6 million at the end of July."" ""The furlough scheme has been absolutely essential to supporting the UK throughout this very difficult period. It has been an historic success."" But he adds: ""Broader economic growth has exceeded expectations as restrictions have been lifted."" And concludes: ""The best way to help vulnerable people is to provide them with the opportunities that they need for well-paid work."" Nadine with her brother Ash Cooper and her sister Victoria Cooper, the last time they were all together in 2019 Nadine Beasley, from Bournemouth, is one of those who have been waiting to visit her family in the US. Despite the change in travel rules she is going to miss her sisterâs wedding, for which she is maid of honour, by days. However, she will be reunited with her family at Christmas. ""My sister is getting married on 30 October in
California,"" she says. ""I was meant to be her maid of honour, my daughter a flowergirl. ""We
were due to fly out on 22 October, so we're naturally upset about the ban being
lifted in November, because we'll miss her wedding by days. ""However, we've now made our fourth rebooking since February
2020 to fly out on 20 December. So that means Christmas with my parents and my
siblings, who are all in California, which is better than the last 18 months of
waiting and knowing nothing."" With the travel ban she has not seen her siblings or parents for more than two years. She says it is annoying that she will miss her sister's wedding by days, having already missed her brother's but says the fact there is ""light at the end of the tunnel"" in the form of a date means it feels like ""a weightâs been lifted"". ""Weâre going with my nan. Itâs bittersweet because we lost
grandad,"" she adds. The UK government has borrowed record-breaking amounts to pay for measures designed to limit the impact of coronavirus. Government initiatives such as the furlough scheme are estimated to have cost up to Â£70bn by the time they come to an end on 30 September. And sadly it turns out there's no such thing as a magic money tree. So how much exactly has the government borrowed over the course of the pandemic, who has it borrowed from - and when does it have to be paid back? Find out here.

More than 16 million people have now downloaded the app, with more than 12 million in England doing so since 17 May when the Covid Pass feature to prove vaccination for events and foreign travel was added to it. Some 1.5 million people have now registered their organ donation decision through the platform, with 265,000 of those doing it via the app for the first time, according to the Department of Health and Social Care. Around 150,000 people registered their preference from May. It comes after a new ""opt-out"" organ donation system came into effect last year, known as Max and Keira's law.
The law is named after Keira Ball, who died aged nine in 2017, and Max Johnson, now aged 13, who was saved by her heart. The US will let fully vaccinated travellers from the UK - and many other countries - visit from November. The change in rules, follows a shake-up of England's travel regulations on Friday. Put simply, going overseas is becoming a little bit easier, although, as before, different rules apply for the devolved nations. So where and when can you go, what are the rules around vaccination - and what's happening with the so-called traffic light system which saw countries divided into red, amber and green categories? We have all the answershere.  Katherine SmithBBC News In England 59,000
pupils (0.7%) were absent from school in England at the end of last week
with a confirmed case of Covid, according to the latest Department for
Education attendance figures. A further 45,000 (0.5%) were absent due
to a suspected case. Some 2,000 pupils were absent due to
restrictions in place to manage a Covid outbreak. Fewer than 500 were absent
due to Covid-related school closures. At the end of last term in July, when
bubble systems were in place, more than a million children were absent for
Covid-related reasons. Those figures included 774,000 who were isolating due to
contact with a positive case in school and 81,000 who had a confirmed or
suspected case. A police photo shows the takeaway stash seized by officers New Zealand police have made a bizarre arrest after a pair of alleged gang associates were caught trying to enter Auckland with a boot full of Kentucky Fried Chicken - and tens of thousands of dollars. Under Auckland's strict Level 4 lockdown, all restaurants - including take-away services - remain closed. Police said the men, aged 23 and 30, had travelled from Hamilton, about 75 miles south of Auckland. A police spokesperson told the BBC that officers made the arrest after they noticed a suspicious-looking vehicle travelling on a gravel road on the outskirts of the city. After a chase, the vehicle was stopped and searched. Police located NZ$100,000 (US$70,000; Â£51,000) in cash, as well as at least three buckets of chicken, about 10 cups of coleslaw, a large pack of fries, and four large bags containing other KFC items. The spokesperson said that the men would appear in court for breaching public health rules later in the year - but added that further charges are also likely. The investigation is ongoing. Under New Zealand's tough anti-Covid laws, fines can reach up to NZ$4,000 and can even involve prison sentences of up to six months. Auckland will move to a Level 3 lockdown from midnight on Tuesday, but residents will remain confined to their homes unless they are attending school, work or shopping. As mask wearing on public transport continues to decline, transport unions have expressed concern that it would be difficult to
reintroduce the policy if the government decided to do so. Mike Lynch, general secretary of the RMT union said his
members had noticed a marked policy drift since the government changed the
rules in July. Even where mask wearing remains mandatory, many people were ignoring the rules, he said. He added: ""As more people see others failing to comply, the situation will escalate quickly over the autumn."" ""With the government already making compulsory
mask wearing on transport a contingency if cases escalate in the coming weeks,
there is a real danger they won't be able to get the genie back into the
bottle."" Mick Whelan, general secretary of train driversâ union Aslef, agreed there had been ""a decline, in recent days"" even where mask-wearing is ostensibly required. âWe believe mask wearing should be mandatory on
trains.To protect
passengers and staff and to control the Covid-19 pandemic."" A spokesperson for Unite. which represents bus drivers, said mask wearing was ""collapsing - and has got much worse in
recent weeks"". âIn some cases there are very few passengers wearing masks on a bus, with those
who tend to still wear a mask being older."" Unions are warning that mask wearing on public transport has dropped significantly since it no longer became a legal requirement in England in July. The proportion of people using face coverings at major railway stations is estimated to have slumped from around 80% to around 20%. A government spokesperson said the lifting of restrictions relied on people taking ""personal responsibility"". ""The guidance is clear that people are expected and recommended to wear a mask when they come into contact with people they donât normally meet in enclosed and crowded spaces. âIt is open to transport operators to decide if they want to implement their own policies, working within their particular environment.â Transport for London (TfL), in keeping with many other operators, still require members of the public to wear a mask when travelling. âCovid is still with us and we all have a role to play in doing the right thing and keeping each other safe,"" said Siwan Hayward, Director of Policing and Compliance for TfL ""Wearing a face covering on our services and in our stations is still required under TfLâs condition of carriage,"" she said. She added that ""more than 500 uniformed officers"" were enforcing mask wearing on the network and ""non-exempt customers who fail to comply may be refused travel"".  Â© 2025 BBC.

"Images which appear to show border agents on horseback driving migrants back to a river have sparked an investigation in the US. The pictures widely shared on social media show riders allegedly using their reins against migrants and pushing them back towards the Rio Grande in Texas. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas says his department will investigate reports of alleged abuse. He said the officers were trying to manage the migrants crossing the river. Some 13,000 mainly Haitian migrants have gathered in a makeshift camp under a bridge connecting Del Rio to Mexico's Ciudad AcuÃ±a on the US-Mexico border. White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the footage was horrible to watch. ""I have seen some of the footage. I don't have the full context. I can't imagine what context would make that appropriate. But I don't have additional details and certainly I don't think anyone seeing that footage would think it was acceptable or appropriate."" US flies Haitian migrants back from Texas border Some social media users said the pictures were reminiscent of the violence seen in slavery times in the US. The pictures taken by AFP photographer Paul Ratje show Haitians going back and forth across the border to get food for their families, and finding themselves blocked by the horses. ""Some of the migrants started running to try to get around the horsemen, and one of the agents grabbed the Haitian in the picture by the shirt and he ended up swinging him around while the horse trotted in a circle,"" he said of a couple of particular photographs. Ratje says he does not think the man was hurt; shortly after that, he said they ""kind of calmed down, and they started letting people in"". US Border Patrol chief Raul Ortiz said the incident was being investigated to make sure there was not an ""unacceptable"" response by his officers, adding they operated in a difficult environment, trying to distinguish migrants from smugglers. US Border Patrol agents on horseback have been trying to close off crossing points along the Rio Grande river The UN's refugee agency, the UNHCR, has said it is monitoring US expulsions to Haiti, adding it was imperative that people fearing persecution had access to asylum, Reuters news agency reports.

"The British food industry will be forced to pay five times more for carbon dioxide as part of a government deal with a US company to restart production in the UK. Environment Secretary George Eustice said carbon dioxide prices would rise from Â£200 per tonne to Â£1,000. The government has agreed to pay out tens of millions of pounds to CF Industries to reopen a plant in the UK. The closure had raised fears over food supplies and the nuclear industry. US-owned CF Industries recently shut two UK sites that produce 60% of the country's commercial carbon dioxide supplies, because of a sharp rise in gas prices. This video can not be played Ros Atkins on... the UK's rising energy bills Farms, food producers and supermarkets have warned that a shortage of carbon dioxide will lead to significant disruption to the manufacture and supply of fresh produce. The Times also reported,externalthat ministers were concerned that the UK might have to close its six advanced gas-cooled nuclear reactors, which also use CO2. The government announced late on Tuesday night that it would meet the full operating costs to run CF Industries' Billingham plant in Teesside for three weeks. The costs are expected to be in the ""low tens of millions"" and will be below Â£50m. Mr Eustice said that the deal with CF Industries ""will be not a loan, it will be a payment to underwrite some of their fixed costs"". At the end of the three-week period, it is hoped that the price of carbon dioxide will have risen sufficiently to make it economically viable for CF Industries to keep production running. Mr Eustice said the food industry would have to accept ""a big, sharp rise"" carbon dioxide prices from Â£200 to Â£1,000 a tonne. ""The critical thing was to get the production up and running expeditiously. That's why we've needed this government intervention,"" he said. ""But we've had meetings with the food industry. They all recognise that the price of carbon dioxide is going to increase substantially and when that price increases, then the market signal will be then for these plants to continue producing."" Mr Eustice insisted that the rise in cost would not have a ""significant impact"" on food prices. He said that while food prices were increasing ""due to global commodity prices, oil prices and also other factors such as labour shortages"", carbon dioxide was ""a tiny proportion"" of the industry's overall costs. CF Industries had halted two of its fertiliser factories - which produce carbon dioxide as a by-product - because of gas prices. Carbon dioxide is used in the slaughter of animals such as chickens CF Industries' Billingham plant will need up to three days to start producing new CO2. The company told the BBC it had ""no estimate"" on when its second UK plant at Ince in Cheshire would  resume production. The British Meat Processors Association said the deal to open CF Industries' Teesside plant was a ""huge relief"" and said it was now ""focused on re-establishing supplies before Friday this week, which is when around 25% of pork production was in danger of shutting down"". Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, welcomed the decision, but said the timetable to restart CF Industries' factory and begin producing carbon dioxide ""will still be tight"". He told the BBC's Today programme: ""Our understanding is that provided that carbon dioxide starts to get through to food producers by the end of the week, then we can avert major and significant disruption in our stores."" Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the ""exceptional short-term arrangement"" would ensure industries that rely on a stable supply of CO2 ""have the resources they require to avoid disruption"". He said: ""With regards to the CO2 situation, it was abundant, it was very cheap and I think a lot of people were surprised at what happened."" The government intends to publish the letter from Mr Kwarteng to Tony Will, chief executive of CF Industries, which sets out the terms of the taxpayer support. Commenting on the three-week deal, Mr Kwarteng said: ""In a critical intervention you have to have a way of exiting the arrangement. ""It is not a case of just trying to nationalise it or supporting it indefinitely, and that is why in the critical period we needed to have a short term arrangement I am confident that we can get other sources of CO2 in that period. Mr Eustice said that the shortage of carbon dioxide had been caused by a ""perfect storm"" of circumstances where CF Industries had shut its two plants because ""an increase in gas price means they are not profitable"", while two other providers had closed their sites for maintenance. But the British Meat Processors Association (BMPA) said the current difficulties showed how exposed the UK is, because of its reliance on such a small number of carbon dioxide producers. ""Over many years, we have had a major consolidation of the industry resulting in sectors like food and drink, nuclear and health being reliant on a very small number of very large suppliers,"" the BMPA said. ""If a market-based solution is to be found, it will likely involve longer-term higher prices for CO2, which will be sustainable for some, but not all users of the gas."" Ian Wright, the chief executive of the Food and Drink Federation, also called on the government to support other fertiliser producers and help food producers to look for alternatives to CO2. Mr Will, who flew from the US to the UK on Sunday to meet Mr Kwarteng, said: ""We look forward to working with Secretary Kwarteng and the UK government on developing a longer-term solution, including the development of alternative suppliers of CO2 for the UK market."" Farmers fear gas price crisis may spark pig cull How could the CO2 shortage hit food supplies? Gas price crisis: Government poised to step in The BBC understands that the deal with CF Industries has been drafted so that other companies who stop production because of high commodity prices will not be able to ask the government for similar help. Norwegian firm Yara has also cut production at a number of European factories, including one in Hull. This video can not be played The prime minister says he does ânot believe people will be short of foodâ amid reports of some empty supermarket shelves. Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged people not to worryabout putting food on the table this winter, amid rising energy and food bills and a cut to universal credit. Wholesale prices for gas have surged 250% since January, with a 70% rise since August alone, leading to calls for support from the industry and the collapse of some smaller energy firms. Mr Opie added that the government should also take action on other issues affecting food retailers in recent weeks, such as the shortage of HGV drivers, which has been exacerbated by the pandemic and many drivers returning to the European Union after Brexit. The government has been keen to stress that this is very much an emergency measure, time-limited, and with a cap on the amount it is prepared to pay. It had to do something. Food producers were warning that shortages would become apparent within days, at a time when supply chains have already been disrupted by other issues, such as a lack of lorry drivers. But the fact remains that it has agreed to give a large US-owned company tens of millions of pounds of taxpayers' money, just to operate one of its own plants. That isn't a particularly good look - and it has cast a glaring spotlight on the vulnerability of a key part of the economy. Now there is a three-week window for government, supermarkets and food producers to come up with a ""sustainable market-based solution"". In practice, that's likely to mean users paying more for their CO2, a cost which will ultimately be borne by consumers.

"A trip to a melting glacier will shape how the BBC's new climate editor, Justin Rowlatt, reports on the story of climate change. You cannot help but be awed by the scale of Antarctica, the great white continent. I visited just before the pandemic struck and it is impossible not to feel humbled in the presence of something that seems so much bigger and more powerful than you. But that sensation is an illusion. When we finally flew over the front of the enormous glacier after weeks of travelling, I found myself staring down at an epic vision of shattered ice. As I wrote at the time, it felt like I'd reached the frontline of climate change; a place where the equilibrium that has held our world in balance for thousands of years was slipping and crashing. World's glaciers melting at a faster pace West Antarctica's Getz glaciers flowing faster A really simple guide to climate change Four ways climate change links to extreme weather Satellite monitoring shows that the overall rate of ice loss from West Antarctica has increased five-fold over a 25-year period. This one glacier - Thwaite's glacier - alone now accounts for 4% of global sea level rise. Needless to say, this acceleration is a result of us humans polluting the air with greenhouse gases. That fact explodes any impression that the ice is overwhelming. The opposite is true, we are overwhelming the ice. I was surprised how moved I was by what I'd seen. In the weeks it took to travel home, I tried to process my emotions. I thought about the men and women who had set our camp, who flew the planes, cooked the meals, processed the rubbish and groomed the ice runways. And I thought about the scientists who have been studying the processes at work for decades. Our research trip was only possible because of a huge chain of human enterprise culminating with the hardworking people in the UK and US whose taxes paid for it all. This video can not be played The BBC's Justin Rowlatt learns to make an igloo As I flew back to the UK, I reflected how it is often claimed that selfishness, greed and conflict are the hallmarks of humanity, but that is wrong. The defining human characteristic is actually our ability to co-operate - our ability to solve problems together explains the dominance our species has achieved. For the first time since I had been to the front of the glacier I began to feel the stir of something I was worried I'd lost entirely: a sense of purpose. I retell this story now because I want that sense that we can come together and take control of the processes driving climate change to underpin my reporting in my new role as climate editor. Of course, the BBC has been reporting climate change for decades and we'll be keeping up that tradition, especially during a crucial UN climate conference in Glasgow in November, where nations will be asked to renew their commitments to cutting emissions. But however ambitious the deal there is, we need to continue to report the latest science on climate change and the effect it is having on our world. And use that science as a yardstick to judge the progress our societies are making to reduce emissions. That means scrutinising what politicians, business people and - yes - all of us consumers are doing to try to reduce our impact on the climate. I do not want to nag or hector. We all face the same dilemmas over how the choices we make in our lives affect the climate. And I am optimistic about what we can achieve. We humans are wary of change but we are actually extraordinarily adaptable - another key to our success as a species. And we have a vast capacity for innovation. Think of the huge offshore wind industry flourishing here in the UK, or the way our car industry is retooling as the ban on new petrol and diesel vehicles approaches. Look at the UK companies at the forefront of all sorts of exciting low-carbon technologies - from nuclear fusion to plant-based foods - and consider the fortunes to be made as these new markets go global. And look at the progress being made to mobilise international finance behind the effort to tackle climate change - an endeavour being led by the City of London. But I will not forget what I saw in Antarctica. It reminds us that climate change is a process that is likely to take centuries to play out, and tens of thousands of years to reverse. Consider this: the last time CO2 levels were this high is reckoned to have been around four million years ago and it is estimated that the sea level then could have been as much as 30-40 metres higher than it is now. That's a measure of how important the climate issue is and also explains why I'm so pleased to be given this opportunity to play a role in covering it for the BBC. Tackling global warming will be the central project of the 21st Century and it is an incredible privilege to have been given a front row seat.

And use that science as a yardstick to judge the progress our societies are making to reduce emissions. That means scrutinising what politicians, business people and - yes - all of us consumers are doing to try to reduce our impact on the climate. I do not want to nag or hector. We all face the same dilemmas over how the choices we make in our lives affect the climate. And I am optimistic about what we can achieve. We humans are wary of change but we are actually extraordinarily adaptable - another key to our success as a species. And we have a vast capacity for innovation. Think of the huge offshore wind industry flourishing here in the UK, or the way our car industry is retooling as the ban on new petrol and diesel vehicles approaches. Look at the UK companies at the forefront of all sorts of exciting low-carbon technologies - from nuclear fusion to plant-based foods - and consider the fortunes to be made as these new markets go global. And look at the progress being made to mobilise international finance behind the effort to tackle climate change - an endeavour being led by the City of London. But I will not forget what I saw in Antarctica. It reminds us that climate change is a process that is likely to take centuries to play out, and tens of thousands of years to reverse. Consider this: the last time CO2 levels were this high is reckoned to have been around four million years ago and it is estimated that the sea level then could have been as much as 30-40 metres higher than it is now. That's a measure of how important the climate issue is and also explains why I'm so pleased to be given this opportunity to play a role in covering it for the BBC. Tackling global warming will be the central project of the 21st Century and it is an incredible privilege to have been given a front row seat.

"A trip to a melting glacier will shape how the BBC's new climate editor, Justin Rowlatt, reports on the story of climate change. You cannot help but be awed by the scale of Antarctica, the great white continent. I visited just before the pandemic struck and it is impossible not to feel humbled in the presence of something that seems so much bigger and more powerful than you. But that sensation is an illusion. When we finally flew over the front of the enormous glacier after weeks of travelling, I found myself staring down at an epic vision of shattered ice. As I wrote at the time, it felt like I'd reached the frontline of climate change; a place where the equilibrium that has held our world in balance for thousands of years was slipping and crashing. World's glaciers melting at a faster pace West Antarctica's Getz glaciers flowing faster A really simple guide to climate change Four ways climate change links to extreme weather Satellite monitoring shows that the overall rate of ice loss from West Antarctica has increased five-fold over a 25-year period. This one glacier - Thwaite's glacier - alone now accounts for 4% of global sea level rise. Needless to say, this acceleration is a result of us humans polluting the air with greenhouse gases. That fact explodes any impression that the ice is overwhelming. The opposite is true, we are overwhelming the ice. I was surprised how moved I was by what I'd seen. In the weeks it took to travel home, I tried to process my emotions. I thought about the men and women who had set our camp, who flew the planes, cooked the meals, processed the rubbish and groomed the ice runways. And I thought about the scientists who have been studying the processes at work for decades. Our research trip was only possible because of a huge chain of human enterprise culminating with the hardworking people in the UK and US whose taxes paid for it all. This video can not be played The BBC's Justin Rowlatt learns to make an igloo As I flew back to the UK, I reflected how it is often claimed that selfishness, greed and conflict are the hallmarks of humanity, but that is wrong. The defining human characteristic is actually our ability to co-operate - our ability to solve problems together explains the dominance our species has achieved. For the first time since I had been to the front of the glacier I began to feel the stir of something I was worried I'd lost entirely: a sense of purpose. I retell this story now because I want that sense that we can come together and take control of the processes driving climate change to underpin my reporting in my new role as climate editor.

"This video can not be played Justin Trudeau: ""Millions of Canadians have chosen a progressive plan"" Justin Trudeau's Liberal Party has narrowly won Canada's election, but it failed to secure a majority of seats. This is Mr Trudeau's third federal election win, but his critics say the poll was a waste of time. The Liberals are projected to win 158 seats, short of the 170 seats needed for the majority Mr Trudeau was seeking with his early election call. The Conservatives have held onto their main opposition status and are expected to win about 122 seats. ""There are still votes to be counted but what we've seen tonight is millions of Canadians have chosen a progressive plan,"" Mr Trudeau told supporters in Montreal in the early hours of Tuesday morning. ""You elected a government that will fight for you and deliver for you,"" he said. The election, which took place during a fourth pandemic wave in Canada, was the most expensive in the country's history, costing some C$600m ($470m; Â£344m). The projected results suggest a parliament strikingly similar to the one elected just two years ago in 2019. The snap election call, sending Canadians to the polls for the second time in two years, was widely seen as a bid by Mr Trudeau to secure a majority government and he struggled to explain why a campaign was necessary. Conservative leader Erin O'Toole suggested it was a waste of time and money. ""Canadians sent him back with another minority at a cost of $600m and deeper divisions in our great country"", he told reporters. Mr Trudeau maintained that the election gave the incoming government a clear mandate in moving forward. But over the course of the campaign, he struggled to convince voters of the need for an election, which also coincided with rising Covid-19 case loads due to the Delta variant. Separately he was also heckled by anti-vaccine protesters on the campaign trail, with some shouting they would refuse the Covid jab. While questions will inevitably be raised about Mr Trudeau's political future, Liberal MP Pablo Rodriguez told journalists early in the evening that no matter the outcome, he had  ""100% confidence"" in him as Liberal Party leader. ""And all the members of the party do as well,"" he said. The country's left-wing New Democrats (NDP), which ran on a ""tax the ultra-rich"" message with leader Jagmeet Singh trying to tap into progressive voters frustrated with the Liberals, looks to have picked up a small number of seats. Vote counts will continue to trickle in over the coming days as elections officials tally the roughly one million mail-in ballots cast this election, and current seat tallies are still to be finalised. Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole speaks from Oshawa, Ontario For the Conservatives, the result is a disappointment for new party leader Erin O'Toole, who ran on a centrist message in a bid to expand the party's base of support. Like in 2019, the party is projected to have won the popular vote. But the first-past-the-post system - awarding victory to the candidate with most votes in any given constituency - means that has not translated to seats won. Speaking to party faithful in Oshawa, Ontario, a defiant Mr O'Toole pitched his vision for a bigger Conservative tent, saying: ""Our party needed the courage to change because Canada has changed."" He urged supporters not to waiver from the commitment to grow the party's base, acknowledging that ""clearly there is more work for us to do"" in setting the stage for a better showing in the next campaign. Election night - as it happened Trudeau - a life in politics The man who hoped to topple Trudeau Conservative strategist Jason Lietaer told journalists at party headquarters that there's reason to keep  Mr O'Toole on as leader despite his failure to secure them a victory. ""He's gone from unknown to contender in just a few weeks,"" Mr Lietaer said. ""O'Toole was a huge underdog. To be within a few points is something we're all proud of."" Jagmeet Singh speaks alongside his pregnant wife While minority governments are common in Canada, coalitions are extremely rare and Mr Trudeau will need to compromise with opposition parties to pass legislation. The NDP are likely to be kingmakers in this new parliament, and could help the Liberals to survive key confidence votes and get their policies through. Mr Singh, the NDP leader, speaking in Burnaby, British Columbia, noted he had secured concessions from Mr Trudeau in the last parliament. He said he had a laundry list of priorities this time around, and vowed to push for action on climate change, affordable housing, and healthcare. ""You can be sure if we work together we can build a better society,"" he said. The night saw setbacks for both the Green Party and the People's Party of Canada (PPC). New Green leader Annamie Paul was badly defeated in her efforts to secure a seat in Toronto, after she struggled with internal party divisions that threatened her leadership. ""I am disappointed - it is hard to lose, no one likes to lose,"" Ms Paul said as she thanked supporters. Still, the party is still projected to send at least two members of parliament to Ottawa. The PPC failed to secure any seats despite a late surge as its populist leader tapped into a vein of anger among some Canadians over vaccine mandates and lockdown measures, but did increase its overall vote share.

"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says new Covid cases fell by 31% in the week to 18 September She says this is ""a very encouraging trend"" but warns against complacency and says the position remains ""fragile"" On Tuesday, 2,870 new cases of Covid were reported - and a further 18 people who have tested positive have died Ms Sturgeon also tells MSPs that the government has finalised its definition of nightclubs under the vaccine passports scheme They must be open between midnight and 0500; serve alcohol after midnight; offer music for dancing; and have an area for dancing Health Secretary Humza Yousaf also gives a statement on plans to bolster the NHS amid pressure on accident and emergency departments He says 88 military staff will be called in as ambulance drivers, along with a further 15 support workers BBC Scotland News The health secretary announced additional
  funding of Â£20m for the Scottish Ambulance Service. Humza Yousaf said the new investment would deliver: The Scottish Ambulance Service operates a colour-coded response system Alex Cole-Hamilton begins: ""This situation is unacceptable."" The Scottish Lib Dem leader insists it is not just caused by the pandemic. He argues the military, fire fighters and taxi drivers should not have to bail out the ambulance service. Mr Cole-Hamilton says: ""Can I ask the cabinet secretary just how long does he expect this crisis to last?"" ""We are in the midst of a global pandemic,"" replies the health secretary. Mr Yousaf says Mr Cole-Hamilton lacks credibility if he says the pandemic has nothing to do with the pressures on the ambulance service. Scottish Labour health spokeswoman Jackie Baillie accuses the health secretary of being ""missing in action"" and says ambulance delays continue at ""record levels"". She asks about increases in bed capacity and whether temporary wards will be considered or field hospitals, like the now-closedNHS Louisa Jordanin Glasgow. Mr Yousaf dismisses her opening remarks and says he has been giving regular interviews to the media. He adds ""urgent discussions"" are under way to boost bed capacity and he promises to update parliament on any progress. The health secretary says the equipment for the NHS Louisa Jordan has been made available to health boards but points out that field hospitals would require pulling staff from ""extremely busy"" hospitals. He says setting up extra beds is only part of the solution, as they must be staffed, but adds he ""would not dismiss the idea in its entirety"". For the Scottish Conservatives, Dr Sandesh Gulhane begins by saying the health secretary's statement was published on the front of the Daily Record first, before he got to see it. The party's health spokesperson says that for weeks we have heard about ""horrendous waits for ambulances"". He asks why the government is requiring the Scottish Ambulance Service to make Â£15m of efficiency savings, ""otherwise known as cuts"". Dr Gulhane calls for weekly response data and for an NHS winter plane. Humza Yousaf reiterates that an additional Â£20m is being spent help relieve the pressure on the ambulance service. Mr Yousaf insists: ""There will not be a single penny cut from the Scottish Ambulance Service's budget."" He says the budget has increased by Â£44m this year. A winter plan will be brought forward imminently, he concludes. Mr Yousaf concludes by confirming work is underway with health boards to boost capacity by expanding ""the footprint of our hospitals, even if it's on a temporary basis"". This will no doubt be the most difficult autumn/ winter that our health and social care services have ever faced. Humza Yousaf, Health Secretray Turning to the long term, Mr Yousaf says almost 300 additional ambulance staff will be recruited by April next year. He adds the service is taking forward its recruitment plans at pace. Additional ambulances will also be introduced over the coming months. He added that on-call requirement had been reduced in Campbeltown and ""removed entirely"" in Fort William, Kirkwall and Broadford to free up emergency cover. Mr Yousaf also confirms the ambulance service is aiming to bring on board 100 second-year paramedic students to work across the service. This will include working in control centres to assist with call-handling over the winter. The health secretary says temporary clinical input will also be brought in for several issues, such as mental health, breathing difficulties and falls. He adds this will help to ""optimise the response"" patients receive and identify ""additional clinical pathways"" where appropriate. Mr Yousaf says: ""Bolstering capacity at both the front and the back ends of the ambulance service  will be fundamental to saving lives and I'm thankful to all the individuals and organisations who have offered their support."" These are not decisions we have taken lightly at all but given the urgency of the situation this government needs to respond with this decisive, if unconventional, action to save lives. Humza Yousaf, Health Secretary  Mr Yousaf confirms support has also been sought from the British Red Cross and private contractors, such as taxi companies, where no ambulance is required.  Let me be absolutely clear, if you are in critical or life-threatening need you will be taken to hospital in an ambulance if one is requested. Alternative transport arrangements are for those patients with low acuity and patient safety will remain, of course, our number one priority. Humza Yousaf, Health Secretary Mr Yousaf confirms the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service will also be drafted in to bolster ambulance services. He confirms they will ""scale up"" access to volunteer firefighters and firefighters for driving. The health secretary confirms this will provide ""more valuable"" time for paramedics and ambulance technicians. The pending involvement of the SFRS was reported in the Daily Record newspaper on Tuesday leading to a strong rebuke from the presiding officer. Before Mr Yousaf's speech, Alison Johnstone told MSPs such announcements should first be made in the parliament as opposed to the media. Some military personnel should be driving ambulances by the weekend ""I can confirm the request for military assistance was made immediately after first minister's questions,"" continues Mr Yousaf. The health secretary says the military assistance will include 88 drivers to free up medics and technicians. He says 15 further support staff will mean the military is providing 103 personnel to the service. Mr Yousaf says some of the military personnel should be driving ambulances by this weekend. Mr Yousaf details the pressure the ambulance services are under. The health secretary points to additional funding used to recruit more ambulance staff, enhanced air capacity through Logan Air and the setting up of a strategic working group. He says the government actions will be backed up by an additional Â£20m, on top of the original Â£20m top-up for recruitment. Mr Yousaf says some of the cases in the media last week were unacceptable. The health secretary says: ""I have no hesitation in apologising to families who have been let down."" The presiding officer chastises the government for allowing details of this ambulance statement to appear in the press. Humza Yousaf begins the statement with an apology for this. The health secretary moves on to say the last 18 months have been a time of ""unprecedented pressure"" on the NHS. ""It has faced the biggest challenge of its 73-year history,"" he says. He praises the Scottish Ambulance Service, but accepts that some people are not getting the standard of service they should be. Lisa SummersBBC Scotland Health Correspondent Over 550 people waited more than 12 hours in
an emergency department in the second week of September, a record high. Until this summer, the previous weekly high was
in the depths of winter 2018, when the peak number waiting more than 12 hours
was 463. Much of the pressure comes from a scarcity
of beds in other parts of the hospital, to allow people to continue their
treatment away from A&E.  If there is no room elsewhere, people have
to sit on trollies, in cubicles, or in ambulances which cannot then be
dispatched elsewhere. There are numerous reasons why the NHS is
under siege and Covid is only part of the picture. There are challenges in the
community getting people out of hospital, and sometimes wards are closed to new
admissions because of staff sickness or isolation. Staff report dealing
with patients presenting with more advanced illnesses, who need to stay in
hospital longer. Many of the problems the NHS is facing
existed before the pandemic. Demand is ever-growing and being met with long-term staff vacancies and a reduction in hospital beds. Help from the army and additional funds will
be welcomed, but they won't solve the problem overnight. There have been reports of some people facing severe waits for an ambulance to arrive Health Secretary Humza Yousaf will now deliver a ministerial statement on Scotland's ambulance service. This follows the Scottish government asking the MoD for military assistance for the country's ambulance service. Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Alex Cole-Hamilton says there are ""arbitrary distinctions"" being made between businesses in relation to the vaccine passport scheme which will lead to ""commercial unfairness"". For example, he asks: ""Unless your bouncer is Robocop how can venues guard against fraud when visual checking?"" Mr Cole-Hamilton says new rules are being created for businesses while, at the same time, the fundamental right to medical privacy is being ""eroded"". Ms Sturgeon says people expect their government to protect them and their NHS from the pandemic, while allowing businesses to stay open and keep trading. She adds that the government is taking time to get the detail right, such as its consideration over the definition of a nightclub. The first minister also tells MSPs she wants to ensure a ""proportionality"" around spot checks for large-scale events, such as football matches. Susie ForrestHealth producer, BBC Scotland It looks like new Covid infections are slowing down â for
now. But the time it takes for cases to translate into hospital and ICU
admissions means the NHS is still bearing the brunt of the big spike we saw at
the start of the month. Some of these patients will not be seriously ill because of
coronavirus, but will have tested positive while being treated for something
else. That still means they need to be cared for with extra infection control
and resources in place to stop the virus spreading in hospital. Meanwhile, clinicians are juggling huge demand for urgent
treatment as well as trying to make a dent in the backlog of routine surgeries. And staff continue to be pinged when they come into contact
with cases in the community â putting pressure on rotas. Summer has only just turned to autumn â and winter will be
here before long. Ministers will hope that getting infection rates under
control, with vaccines and testing, can give hospitals a fighting chance of
getting through it. Anas Sarwar says cases remain worryingly high and points out that A&E waiting times are the worst on record. ""This is a national scandal and tragedy,"" says the Scottish Labour spokesman. He tells the first minister she should not use the pandemic as cover for these failures. ""How long will it take to fix the ambulance crisis?,"" he asks. He argues there are still ""big gaps"" in the vaccination certification scheme. The first minister accuses Anas Sarwar of being ""deeply disingenuous"" and ""opportunistic"" in his comments about the vaccination certification scheme. Ms Sturgeon points out those going to the Labour Party conference will have a similar scheme in place. She also says there has been increased funding for the NHS and details again actions being taken by her government to address the pressures the NHS is facing. Allow Twitter content?

"""When it goes wrong, it really does go wrong - one wrong move, one throwaway comment and months of planning and international diplomacy are in the bin."" No stress then! As one former Downing Street senior staff member recalls, visits to the White House are about as high pressure as it gets. British prime ministers always lavish praise on the importance of the relationship with the US. So when it's time for an invite to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue the pressure is really on. In the run up to the big event, warm words are the order of the day. Today is no exception. Boris Johnson told the travelling press pack that the relationship between the two countries is as ""good as it has been for decades"", claiming his relationship with President Biden is ""genuinely terrific"", and joking the two have bonded over their love of rail - ""he's a train nut"". There's bonhomie, and - having witnessed the two at the G7 in Cornwall - it is visible. The UK camp is encouraged atthe American removal of travel restrictions on UK citizens in November. And there's a sense that the president might be ready to make extra commitments on climate finance which would thrill Downing Street. But nothing is that straightforward. Increase climate commitments, PM to urge Biden They'll have to confront tensions over the handling of the withdrawal of forces in Afghanistan. And the UK doesn't expect much progress on trade either, saying American negotiators are ""ruthless"", playing down expectations of things moving forward. But first and foremost both sides will want Tuesday's big meeting to go smoothly. No gaffes, no misunderstandings, no embarrassments. Whatever the personal friendships or frictions between the two main protagonists, it matters because, as one No 10 insider told me, ""the relationship matters for the mutual benefit of our people"". The current Downing Street team don't seem to be nervous about the meeting on Tuesday, at least outwardly, but they are conscious of how much it matters, and how previously things have gone awry. Who could forget the last time a British prime minister held talks in the Oval Office? The press conference back in 2017 was quite the experience. This video can not be played President Trump joked about the special relationship with the UK What you might not know was that Theresa May's team was worried about the menu - because the ribs on offer at the getting-to-know-you lunch might plaster barbecue sauce all over the then prime minster's face during the huge TV moment. They discovered the meat was ""neatly chopped"" after all. Or that former President Trump anti-bacced his hands after shaking hands with Theresa May's team - one of them now jokes ""he was ahead of his time"". Or indeed, that ""May bossed her foreign secretary around on the plane on the way, talking down to him in front of others, and yet he is the man now in charge"". Ouch! For David Cameron's team there were similar stresses, and frankly high farce. After ""endless discussions about photo ops"", one member of his team remembers, the two men took Air Force One to a college basketball game, putting David Cameron under unfamiliar pressure when he had to give a half-time interview about the match on a ""subject he knew nothing about"". This video can not be played President Barack Obama has given British Prime Minister David Cameron a front row seat at the US college basketball championships Money couldn't buy these kind of images for a British prime minister - putting them on the spot over alley-oops or a 5-out motion, less desirable altogether. And that's before you factor in the British reaction back then to the mere name of the White House protocol supremo, Randy Bumgardner, to the bemusement of the Americans. Two nations divided perhaps not just by a common language, but by different senses of humour too. So, there is a lot at stake - the risk of misunderstanding, disagreement on policy, a clash of political personality, or just blunders that cause blushes. As one of those who felt it go wrong to their cost told me, ""it's important to be on best behaviour"". Mr Johnson has been to the White House before, as foreign secretary in 2019. But so much has changed then, on this side of the Atlantic and at home. A very different prime minister. A very different president. A very different set of challenges for the world. And British prime ministers' visits to the White House are, as occasions in themselves, about as momentous as it gets.

More than 250 people seeking relocation to the UK - many of whom are in hiding - were mistakenly copied into an email. Mr Wallace has apologised to them, and launched an investigation. One person has been suspended, he said. The MoD has also referred itself to the Information Commissioner's Office. Speaking in the Commons, Mr Wallace said: ""I apologise to those Afghans affected by this data breach and with Home (the Home Office) we are now working with them to provide security advice. ""It is an unacceptable level of service that has let down the thousands of members of the armed forces and veterans. ""On behalf of the Ministry of Defence, I apologise."" He added that armed forces minister James Heappey was in the region speaking to neighbouring states to see what more could be done. 'Betrayed': The Afghans who feel left behind Life under Taliban rule one month on Veteran's joy at seeing Afghan interpreter in UK Stay home, female Kabul government workers told The email was sent to interpreters who remain in Afghanistan or have been able to get to other countries. Their email addresses could be seen by all recipients, showing people's names and some associated profile pictures. The Information Commissioner (ICO), which has the power to issue enforcement notices and fines in the most serious cases, is already making enquiries with the MoD. A spokesperson for the watchdog said people rightly expected their personal information to be handled securely especially where its loss could have devastating consequences, including possible threat to life. Conservative MP Tobias Ellwood, who chairs the defence select committee, warned that the Taliban had not changed. ""We must get these interpreters out or they'll be hunted and killed,"" he told MPs, and suggested using ""clandestine means"" to get them to safety, if usual methods were unavailable. ""All means will be explored,"" Mr Wallace replied. British forces were in Afghanistan for about 20 years The email was sent by the team in charge of the UK's Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy (Arap), which has been in contact with them since the Taliban took control of the country last month. The team told the interpreters it was doing everything it could to help relocate them. It also said they should not put themselves or their families at risk if it was not safe for them to leave their current location. But one interpreter who received the email realised that more than 250 Afghans who worked with British forces had been copied into the email. ""This mistake could cost the life of interpreters, especially for those who are still in Afghanistan,"" they told the BBC. ""Some of the interpreters didn't notice the mistake and they replied to all the emails already and they explained their situation which is very dangerous. The email contains their profile pictures and contact details."" The MoD then sent another email 30 minutes later with the title ""Urgent - Arap case contact"" asking the recipients to delete the previous email and warning ""your email address may have been compromised"". It recommended the interpreters change their email addresses. Mr Wallace said the Ministry of Defence believed there were 900 ""credible cases"" for Arap resettlement still in Afghanistan beyond the 311 the government is currently speaking to. Labour shadow defence secretary John Healey welcomed the defence secretary's apology but told the Commons that action now mattered most. He told MPs: ""These Afghan interpreters worked alongside our British forces and the government rightly pledged to protect them. Ministers must make good on those promises now."" Ahmad, not his real name, is one of the 250 or so whose names were mistakenly shared by the MoD. In 2011, he was shot by the Taliban while working as an interpreter with British troops in Helmand. He's currently in hiding in Afghanistan, living apart from his wife and baby daughter for their own safety. He told the BBC he was really shocked and disappointed when he spotted the MoD's mistake. ""Just when you think it can't get worse than this, along comes the Arap team and does something that proves you wrong. I didn't really expect this from them,"" he said. ""I'm 100% sure that it will have a negative impact on our safety because you know that we are already displaced from our home town. ""Now we have to change our locations again and we have to change our email addresses."" Ahmad added that he now doubted whether he would ever get to safety in the UK. ""I'm not very optimistic, because when I see their carelessness and their neglect, I don't think we're going to be in the UK in the near future."" But he said he was clinging to hope that the UK would ""finally do the right thing"". Have you been affected by the issues raised in this story? Tell us by emailing:haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

"This video can not be played Young royals share one of Prince Philip's favourite practical jokes in the BBC One programme The Duke of Cambridge has revealed one of the Duke of Edinburgh's favourite games was getting his grandchildren to squirt mustard all over the ceiling. ""He used to take the lid off [the tube] and put it in your hands... and then he'd squish your hands together to fire the mustard onto the ceiling."" Her Majesty was not amused. ""He used to get in a lot of trouble from my grandmother,"" Prince William recalls, in a forthcoming BBC One documentary to be aired on Wednesday. Prince Philip: The Royal Family Remembers features all four of the Queen and Prince Philip's children, along with their adult grandchildren and members of the duke's long-serving staff. Zara Tindall and Peter Phillips - children of the Princess Royal - also reminisce about the duke's antics with the mustard. ""He gets you to hold it in your hands and I can't remember exactly what he says - but he ends up slamming your hands together... it goes all over the ceiling,"" says Ms Tindall. ""I actually think the marks are still there,"" her brother adds. ""He enjoyed those jokes, he enjoyed messing around the children and being a grandfather,"" says Prince William, who remembers the duke - who died in April aged 99 - as ""the heart of the family"". The light-hearted revelation is one of a number of poignant and amusing insights in the documentary, originally conceived as a personal portrait to mark Prince Philip's 100th birthday - with much of the footage shot before his death. ""He made time for all of us, he supported all of us - and he kept control of... most of us,"" laughs Mr Phillips. Prince Philip's will to be secret for 90 years Royal Family tree and line of succession Obituary: HRH the Duke of Edinburgh Mr Phillips also recalls the duke's frustration as he got to grips with a new gadget, often denouncing the offending machine as ""bloody stupid"" in loud tones, overheard from the breakfast room ""I have memories of him getting a new laptop or a new printer - and hearing him shouting at it,"" says Mr Phillips. ""He loved technology... but it was always quite entertaining to see him trying to figure them out!"" The documentary-makers were given special access to the Queen's private cine-film collection, which shows the Royal Family enjoying ordinary family events, such as barbecuing in Balmoral and riding bikes around their garden. ""Every barbecue that I have ever been on, the Duke of Edinburgh has been there cooking,"" says Prince William, over footage of a family picnic. ""He adored barbecuing,"" says Prince Charles, adding, with a smile: ""He turned that into an interesting art form...."" The Duke of Edinburgh is the longest-serving consort in history Both Prince William and his brother, the Duke of Sussex, said the Queen and the duke looked forward to unexpected events while carrying out their official duties together. ""My grandfather loved things when they go wrong,"" says Prince William. ""They've lived a life where everything has to go right the whole time and so when things go wrong, they both chuckle an awful lot. ""Everyone else gets mortally embarrassed. They love it."" ""More than anything I miss his humour,"" says Prince Harry. ""But I miss him more for my grandmother because I know how incredibly strong she was with him there. ""I also know that she's going be OK without him,"" he adds. Prince Philip: The Royal Family Remembers, Wednesday at 9pm on BBC One.

"Gas and electricity bills are going up again on 1 January, when the latest energy price cap takes effect. Customers are encouraged to submit a meter reading to ensure they are charged the correct amount. The energy price cap covers 26 million households in England, Wales and Scotland and is setevery three months,externalby the energy regulator Ofgem. It fixes the maximum price that can be charged for each unit of energy on a standard - or default - tariff for a typical dual-fuel household which pays by direct debit. Between 1 January and 31 March 2025,gas prices will be capped at 6.34p per kilowatt hour (kWh), and electricity at 24.86 per kWh.,external This means the annual bill for a dual-fuel direct debit household using a typical amount of energywill go up to Â£1,738 per year, an increase of Â£21 from the previous cap. Those who pay their bills every three months by cash or cheque will pay Â£1,851. Analysts at forecaster Cornwall Insight, which tracks the energy market, expect prices to fall slightly in April and October 2025, but says thathigh domestic energy prices are likely to be ""the new normal"". The cap does not apply in Northern Ireland, which has its own energy market. Your energy bill depends on the overall amount of gas and electricity you use, and how you pay for it. The type of property you live in, how energy efficient it is, how many people live there and the weather all make a difference. The Ofgem cap is based on a ""typical household"" using 11,500 kWh of gas and 2,700 kWh of electricity a year with a single bill for gas and electricity, settled by direct debit. The vast majority of people pay their bill this way to help spread payments across the year. Those who pay every three months by cash or cheque are charged more. Energy prices could vary at different times of day Submitting a meter reading when the cap changes means you will not be charged for estimated usage at the wrong rate. This is especially important when prices go up. Customers withworking smart metersdo not need to submit a reading as their bill is calculated automatically. Fixed-priced deals offer certainty for a set period - often a year, or longer - but if prices drop, you could be stuck at a higher price. Ofgem says customers who want the security of a set price should consider fixed deals. However, it recommends getting independent advice. The price comparison site Uswitch says it is important to check whether fixed deals have exit fees before signing up and to make sure you fully understand the terms of the contract. Because the price cap changes every three months, it is difficult to know with any certainty whether a fixed tariff is a good deal. The longer the fixed term, the greater the uncertainty. Between January and March, households on prepayment meters will pay slightly less than those on direct debit, with a typical bill of Â£1,690, a rise of Â£21 from the previous quarter. About four million households had prepayment meters in April 2024, according to Ofgem. Many have been in place for years, but some were installed more recently after customers struggled to pay higher bills. Rulesintroduced in November 2023,externalmean suppliers must give customers more opportunity to clear their debts before switching them to a meter. They cannot be installed at all in certain households. Energy firms pay out over force-fitting of meters Standing charges are a fixed daily fee to cover the costs of connecting to a supply. They are typically 61p a day for electricity and 32p a day for gas, although they vary slightly by region. Under the energy price cap, they have risen by 43% since 2019. Campaigners argue standing charges are unfair because they make up a larger proportion of the bill of low energy users. Ofgem has proposed thatenergy firms must provide a choice of price-capped tariffsfrom winter 2025, one which has a standing charge and unit rate - as is the case now - and another with no standing charge but a higher unit rate. Customers would be able to choose which suits them best. Separately, it wants a consistent approach from suppliers on how to deal with unpaid bills totalling Â£3.8bn. Changes to the winter fuel payment mean more than 10 million pensioners are not receiving the money this winter. Previously, it was paid to all pensioners in England and Wales born before 25 September 1957. However, in July, the government said future payments would be made only to those on low incomes who receivedcertain benefits, including pension credit. The 2024 payment - worth Â£200 or Â£300 depending on individual circumstances - is paid automatically to eligible pensioners. However, hundreds of thousands of people who are entitled to pension credit do not claim it, which means they will miss out on the winter fuel payment too. How much is the winter fuel payment and who can still get it? TheÂ£500m Household Support Fund,,externalwhich was introduced in September 2021 to help vulnerable customershas been extended until March 2025. TheWarm Home Discount scheme,externalcontinues to offer a discount to eligible pensioners and low income households. The government'sFuel Direct Scheme,externalcan help people to repay an energy debt directly from their benefit payments. In addition, suppliers must offer customers affordable payment plans or repayment holidays if they are struggling with bills. Most suppliers also offer hardship grants.

"Pig farmers fear they may soon have to start killing their animals because of a carbon dioxide shortage at abattoirs caused by soaring gas prices. CO2 is widely used in the food and drinks industry, including for stunning animals at abattoirs before slaughter. But some CO2 suppliers have halted production due to rising energy costs, creating a huge backlog of pigs that at some point will have to be killed. A food and drink trade body says the UK might need to subsidise CO2 production. Farmer Kate Morgan told the BBC on Monday ""thousands of pigs are backlogged on farms. If we can't kill our pigs in an abattoir, then unfortunately we will be resorting to killing them on farms"". Carbon dioxide used by the meat industry is aby-product of fertiliser production. The gas is also used to keep food fresh as well as in dry ice and fizzy drinks. CF Industries, the US-based business which produces about 60% of the UK's food grade CO2,has suspended production at two UK fertiliser plants. Norwegian firm Yara has also cut production at a number of European factories. Ms Morgan, who runs a pig farm near Driffield, east Yorkshire,told BBC 5 Live's Wake up to Money programmethe situation for the industry was already ""pretty dire"" because of labour shortages. Now, meat shortages at supermarkets are a real possibility, she said. ""Abattoirs have about a week's supply of gas. It's a chain: We have constantly got pigs coming out of the breeding herd that need to go in homes. Those homes need to be emptied."" Gas firms seek help amid higher energy bill fears Why are gas prices rising and what if my supplier goes bust? How could the CO2 shortage hit food supplies? Her farm sends about 1,500 pigs each week to abattoirs. Killing her own animals is not something she can bear thinking about. ""I can't even begin to think how we would do it. I don't want to put people who work for us in that situation,"" Ms Morgan said. On-farm killing means the meat is not something that would be able to enter the food supply chain. ""It would be wasted,"" she said. It is estimated there are about 100,000 pigs left on farms that would otherwise have been sent for slaughter, with the backlog having started building up weeks ago because of staff shortages. Andrew Saunders, a director at the UK's biggest pig producer, Pilgrims Pride, said there is no alternative to stunning with CO2. ""It is an essential part of the process,"" he told the BBC. Mr Saunders, also chairman of the British Meat Processor Association, said: ""80% of pigs in the UK are slaughtered in about 10 abattoirs, and those abattoirs all use CO2 stunning systems. We already face some challenges regarding keeping those abattoirs operational - some shortage of labour in those plants."" He said pigs can be kept on farms for only ""a very short period of time. They go beyond their target slaughter weight, they're then unsuitable for size of packets we have for our customers"". He added: ""We hope the government can turn around to intervene to get these CO2 plants up and running again. The particular plants in question supply about 60% of all UK needs and something's required here to get this going pretty quickly."" It is not just the pig industry facing problems, however. On Monday, the Food and Drink Federation (FDF) warned the whole sector faces disruption. In a letter to Environment Secretary George Eustice, the FDF's chief executive, Ian Wright, said: ""Important parts of the food and drink supply chain - already under significant pressure from the impacts of labour shortages, particularly HGV drivers - are now seriously compromised by disruptions in the supply of CO2. ""Across industry, there is a united view that the situation is worsening with little prospect of additional CO2 supply unless the UK government intervenes."" If ministers are considering financial help to support the energy sector, Mr Wright said then ""any subsidies made available must also be considered for the manufacturers of fertiliser to ensure there is no further deterioration across the UK food and drink supply, and production can be restored"". There are worries that food and drink shortages are starting to appear on supermarket shelves, with the problem expected to worsen in the run-up to Christmas without action. Richard Walker, managing director of Iceland, said his supermarket is building up stocks and while there is no immediate shortage problem, he told the BBC the CO2 situation needed to be sorted quickly. ""The thing that has shocked me is that 60% of [CO2] production is concentrated in two factories which are both owned by a foreign business. ""This is something that's clearly critical to national security - not just food but also healthcare as well. So it seems quite perplexing that it's at the whim of a private enterprise in terms of whether it's profitable or not and therefore whether they produce the stuff or not."" The British Soft Drinks Association said if manufacturers could not get hold of CO2 supplies, ""after their reserves have run out, production of certain products will have to cease"". Tony Will, chief executive of CF Industries, has held talks with the government over production at its two fertiliser plants, but the outcome is not clear. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng tweeted that he had met Mr Will and ""discussed the pressures the business is facing and explored possible ways forward to secure vital supplies, including to our food and energy industries"". Wholesale prices for gas have surged 250% since January, with a 70% rise since August alone, leading to calls for support from the industry and the collapse of some smaller energy firms. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who is in New York for a UN General Assembly meeting, said the problem with wholesale prices was ""temporary"". He added that he was ""very confident"" in the UK's supply chains and that market forces should be ""very, very swift"" in fixing the issues but that government would help where it could. A statement from the government said: ""We continue to monitor supplies across critical sectors and are in regular contact with industry on their CO2 supplies. ""The UK benefits from having a diverse range of gas supply sources and we have sufficient capacity to more than meet demand. We do not expect gas supply emergencies this winter.""

"""When it goes wrong, it really does go wrong - one wrong move, one throwaway comment and months of planning and international diplomacy are in the bin."" No stress then! As one former Downing Street senior staff member recalls, visits to the White House are about as high pressure as it gets. British prime ministers always lavish praise on the importance of the relationship with the US. So when it's time for an invite to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue the pressure is really on. In the run up to the big event, warm words are the order of the day. Today is no exception. Boris Johnson told the travelling press pack that the relationship between the two countries is as ""good as it has been for decades"", claiming his relationship with President Biden is ""genuinely terrific"", and joking the two have bonded over their love of rail - ""he's a train nut"". There's bonhomie, and - having witnessed the two at the G7 in Cornwall - it is visible. The UK camp is encouraged atthe American removal of travel restrictions on UK citizens in November. And there's a sense that the president might be ready to make extra commitments on climate finance which would thrill Downing Street. But nothing is that straightforward. Increase climate commitments, PM to urge Biden They'll have to confront tensions over the handling of the withdrawal of forces in Afghanistan. And the UK doesn't expect much progress on trade either, saying American negotiators are ""ruthless"", playing down expectations of things moving forward. But first and foremost both sides will want Tuesday's big meeting to go smoothly. No gaffes, no misunderstandings, no embarrassments. Whatever the personal friendships or frictions between the two main protagonists, it matters because, as one No 10 insider told me, ""the relationship matters for the mutual benefit of our people"". The current Downing Street team don't seem to be nervous about the meeting on Tuesday, at least outwardly, but they are conscious of how much it matters, and how previously things have gone awry. Who could forget the last time a British prime minister held talks in the Oval Office? The press conference back in 2017 was quite the experience. This video can not be played President Trump joked about the special relationship with the UK What you might not know was that Theresa May's team was worried about the menu - because the ribs on offer at the getting-to-know-you lunch might plaster barbecue sauce all over the then prime minster's face during the huge TV moment. They discovered the meat was ""neatly chopped"" after all. Or that former President Trump anti-bacced his hands after shaking hands with Theresa May's team - one of them now jokes ""he was ahead of his time"". Or indeed, that ""May bossed her foreign secretary around on the plane on the way, talking down to him in front of others, and yet he is the man now in charge"". Ouch! For David Cameron's team there were similar stresses, and frankly high farce. After ""endless discussions about photo ops"", one member of his team remembers, the two men took Air Force One to a college basketball game, putting David Cameron under unfamiliar pressure when he had to give a half-time interview about the match on a ""subject he knew nothing about"". This video can not be played President Barack Obama has given British Prime Minister David Cameron a front row seat at the US college basketball championships Money couldn't buy these kind of images for a British prime minister - putting them on the spot over alley-oops or a 5-out motion, less desirable altogether. And that's before you factor in the British reaction back then to the mere name of the White House protocol supremo, Randy Bumgardner, to the bemusement of the Americans. Two nations divided perhaps not just by a common language, but by different senses of humour too. So, there is a lot at stake - the risk of misunderstanding, disagreement on policy, a clash of political personality, or just blunders that cause blushes. As one of those who felt it go wrong to their cost told me, ""it's important to be on best behaviour"". Mr Johnson has been to the White House before, as foreign secretary in 2019. But so much has changed then, on this side of the Atlantic and at home. A very different prime minister. A very different president. A very different set of challenges for the world. And British prime ministers' visits to the White House are, as occasions in themselves, about as momentous as it gets.

"Children struggling with mental health problems during the pandemic are facing ""agonisingly"" long waits for treatment, a BBC investigation has found. Data from half of England's services found one in five seen in the past year waited over 12 weeks for care. The situation has got so bad that parents and head teachers told the BBC they had lost faith in the system. And doctors reported distressed children were ending up at A&E as they had no where else to go. Dr Catherine Hayhurst, from the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said in many cases hospitals have been left with no option but to admit youngsters on to general wards, even though they cannot be provided with specialist mental health support there. ""Children are distressed and agitated. It's difficult to manage on the wards,"" she said. NHS England acknowledged the pandemic had been very difficult for children and young people, but it said it was in the process of significantly expanding access to services to ensure they received quick access to care. How has coronavirus affected mental health? Looking after your mental health in a pandemic Sue Peacock's teenage daughter suffers from severe anxiety and has self-harmed. She has been waiting for treatment since before the pandemic began. Ms Peacock said the situation has made her daughter feel depressed and start to become violent. ""We don't know how long it's going to be before she receives help. ""That feeling of helplessness, I can't even describe how awful as a parent it is to see that. ""You're waiting for a service that you know can help your child."" Specialist care is provided by a network known as Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS). These teams include psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses and social workers who support children with conditions ranging from anxiety and depression to schizophrenia. During 2020-21, they saw 420,000 children and young people - although an estimated 1.5 million under-18s are thought to have a mental health disorder. The waits they faced are not routinely published. But the BBC obtained data under the Freedom of Information Act from 46 of England's services, half of the total, covering just over 250,000 under 18s. The figures from April 2020 to March 2021 showed: Half of those who were seen waited longer than four weeks A fifth waited more than 12 weeks The average wait was more than two months - although in some areas it topped eight A third of the trusts also provided data on youngsters still waiting for treatment, with the numbers doubling since the end of the first lockdown in June 2020. There are signs that waiting times have improved since before the pandemic. But this is likely to be down to a drop in people coming forward for help in the first lockdown, helping services tackle the backlog in those waiting for treatment. The BBC has also been told some services closed their waiting lists altogether, meaning the true extent of the waits may be undercounted. Head teacher Michelle Catterson has lost faith with child mental health services because of the waits. She runs Moon Hall School in Surrey, which teaches children aged seven to 16 with dyslexia. ""The pandemic has been really difficult for children. But the support is just not there when they need it,"" Ms Catterson said. ""Services are completely overwhelmed as things stand currently. ""When I have parents that are in a really desperate situation, I'm often reluctant to refer them because I know the length of time that they'll have to wait, and sometimes there just isn't that opportunity to wait. ""You need that support right there, right then, to try and help the child and the family."" Emma Thomas, chief executive of the YoungMinds charity, said it was clear the waits young people were facing were ""agonising"". ""We have seen a big rise in referrals to mental health services and, as this data shows, it's clear they have been struggling to cope. The pandemic has had a huge impact on young people's mental health, exacerbating existing pressures and creating new ones. ""The young people we work with have told us that they have struggled with isolation, loneliness and concerns about the future, whilst those that experienced trauma during the lockdowns, or were already experiencing inequalities, are likely to be disproportionately affected,"" she said. NHS England said it was investing in services, which by 2023 would help support another 345,000 children and young people - on top of the 420,000 being seen currently. This includes the rollout of school mental health teams which are designed to provide earlier support to children than CAMHS services. A spokeswoman for NHS England said: ""There is no doubt that the pandemic has turned children and young people's lives upside down.""

"Pig farmers fear they may soon have to start killing their animals because of a carbon dioxide shortage at abattoirs caused by soaring gas prices. CO2 is widely used in the food and drinks industry, including for stunning animals at abattoirs before slaughter. But some CO2 suppliers have halted production due to rising energy costs, creating a huge backlog of pigs that at some point will have to be killed. A food and drink trade body says the UK might need to subsidise CO2 production. Farmer Kate Morgan told the BBC on Monday ""thousands of pigs are backlogged on farms. If we can't kill our pigs in an abattoir, then unfortunately we will be resorting to killing them on farms"". Carbon dioxide used by the meat industry is aby-product of fertiliser production. The gas is also used to keep food fresh as well as in dry ice and fizzy drinks. CF Industries, the US-based business which produces about 60% of the UK's food grade CO2,has suspended production at two UK fertiliser plants. Norwegian firm Yara has also cut production at a number of European factories. Ms Morgan, who runs a pig farm near Driffield, east Yorkshire,told BBC 5 Live's Wake up to Money programmethe situation for the industry was already ""pretty dire"" because of labour shortages. Now, meat shortages at supermarkets are a real possibility, she said. ""Abattoirs have about a week's supply of gas. It's a chain: We have constantly got pigs coming out of the breeding herd that need to go in homes. Those homes need to be emptied."" Gas firms seek help amid higher energy bill fears Why are gas prices rising and what if my supplier goes bust? How could the CO2 shortage hit food supplies? Her farm sends about 1,500 pigs each week to abattoirs. Killing her own animals is not something she can bear thinking about. ""I can't even begin to think how we would do it. I don't want to put people who work for us in that situation,"" Ms Morgan said. On-farm killing means the meat is not something that would be able to enter the food supply chain. ""It would be wasted,"" she said. It is estimated there are about 100,000 pigs left on farms that would otherwise have been sent for slaughter, with the backlog having started building up weeks ago because of staff shortages. Andrew Saunders, a director at the UK's biggest pig producer, Pilgrims Pride, said there is no alternative to stunning with CO2. ""It is an essential part of the process,"" he told the BBC. Mr Saunders, also chairman of the British Meat Processor Association, said: ""80% of pigs in the UK are slaughtered in about 10 abattoirs, and those abattoirs all use CO2 stunning systems. We already face some challenges regarding keeping those abattoirs operational - some shortage of labour in those plants."" He said pigs can be kept on farms for only ""a very short period of time. They go beyond their target slaughter weight, they're then unsuitable for size of packets we have for our customers"". He added: ""We hope the government can turn around to intervene to get these CO2 plants up and running again. The particular plants in question supply about 60% of all UK needs and something's required here to get this going pretty quickly."" It is not just the pig industry facing problems, however. On Monday, the Food and Drink Federation (FDF) warned the whole sector faces disruption. In a letter to Environment Secretary George Eustice, the FDF's chief executive, Ian Wright, said: ""Important parts of the food and drink supply chain - already under significant pressure from the impacts of labour shortages, particularly HGV drivers - are now seriously compromised by disruptions in the supply of CO2. ""Across industry, there is a united view that the situation is worsening with little prospect of additional CO2 supply unless the UK government intervenes."" If ministers are considering financial help to support the energy sector, Mr Wright said then ""any subsidies made available must also be considered for the manufacturers of fertiliser to ensure there is no further deterioration across the UK food and drink supply, and production can be restored"". There are worries that food and drink shortages are starting to appear on supermarket shelves, with the problem expected to worsen in the run-up to Christmas without action. Richard Walker, managing director of Iceland, said his supermarket is building up stocks and while there is no immediate shortage problem, he told the BBC the CO2 situation needed to be sorted quickly. ""The thing that has shocked me is that 60% of [CO2] production is concentrated in two factories which are both owned by a foreign business. ""This is something that's clearly critical to national security - not just food but also healthcare as well. So it seems quite perplexing that it's at the whim of a private enterprise in terms of whether it's profitable or not and therefore whether they produce the stuff or not."" The British Soft Drinks Association said if manufacturers could not get hold of CO2 supplies, ""after their reserves have run out, production of certain products will have to cease"". Tony Will, chief executive of CF Industries, has held talks with the government over production at its two fertiliser plants, but the outcome is not clear. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng tweeted that he had met Mr Will and ""discussed the pressures the business is facing and explored possible ways forward to secure vital supplies, including to our food and energy industries"". Wholesale prices for gas have surged 250% since January, with a 70% rise since August alone, leading to calls for support from the industry and the collapse of some smaller energy firms. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who is in New York for a UN General Assembly meeting, said the problem with wholesale prices was ""temporary"". He added that he was ""very confident"" in the UK's supply chains and that market forces should be ""very, very swift"" in fixing the issues but that government would help where it could. A statement from the government said: ""We continue to monitor supplies across critical sectors and are in regular contact with industry on their CO2 supplies. ""The UK benefits from having a diverse range of gas supply sources and we have sufficient capacity to more than meet demand. We do not expect gas supply emergencies this winter.""

"This video can not be played Justin Trudeau: ""Millions of Canadians have chosen a progressive plan"" Justin Trudeau's Liberal Party has narrowly won Canada's election, but it failed to secure a majority of seats. This is Mr Trudeau's third federal election win, but his critics say the poll was a waste of time. The Liberals are projected to win 158 seats, short of the 170 seats needed for the majority Mr Trudeau was seeking with his early election call. The Conservatives have held onto their main opposition status and are expected to win about 122 seats. ""There are still votes to be counted but what we've seen tonight is millions of Canadians have chosen a progressive plan,"" Mr Trudeau told supporters in Montreal in the early hours of Tuesday morning. ""You elected a government that will fight for you and deliver for you,"" he said. The election, which took place during a fourth pandemic wave in Canada, was the most expensive in the country's history, costing some C$600m ($470m; Â£344m). The projected results suggest a parliament strikingly similar to the one elected just two years ago in 2019. The snap election call, sending Canadians to the polls for the second time in two years, was widely seen as a bid by Mr Trudeau to secure a majority government and he struggled to explain why a campaign was necessary. Conservative leader Erin O'Toole suggested it was a waste of time and money. ""Canadians sent him back with another minority at a cost of $600m and deeper divisions in our great country"", he told reporters. Mr Trudeau maintained that the election gave the incoming government a clear mandate in moving forward. But over the course of the campaign, he struggled to convince voters of the need for an election, which also coincided with rising Covid-19 case loads due to the Delta variant. Separately he was also heckled by anti-vaccine protesters on the campaign trail, with some shouting they would refuse the Covid jab. While questions will inevitably be raised about Mr Trudeau's political future, Liberal MP Pablo Rodriguez told journalists early in the evening that no matter the outcome, he had  ""100% confidence"" in him as Liberal Party leader. ""And all the members of the party do as well,"" he said. The country's left-wing New Democrats (NDP), which ran on a ""tax the ultra-rich"" message with leader Jagmeet Singh trying to tap into progressive voters frustrated with the Liberals, looks to have picked up a small number of seats. Vote counts will continue to trickle in over the coming days as elections officials tally the roughly one million mail-in ballots cast this election, and current seat tallies are still to be finalised. Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole speaks from Oshawa, Ontario For the Conservatives, the result is a disappointment for new party leader Erin O'Toole, who ran on a centrist message in a bid to expand the party's base of support. Like in 2019, the party is projected to have won the popular vote. But the first-past-the-post system - awarding victory to the candidate with most votes in any given constituency - means that has not translated to seats won. Speaking to party faithful in Oshawa, Ontario, a defiant Mr O'Toole pitched his vision for a bigger Conservative tent, saying: ""Our party needed the courage to change because Canada has changed."" He urged supporters not to waiver from the commitment to grow the party's base, acknowledging that ""clearly there is more work for us to do"" in setting the stage for a better showing in the next campaign. Election night - as it happened Trudeau - a life in politics The man who hoped to topple Trudeau Conservative strategist Jason Lietaer told journalists at party headquarters that there's reason to keep  Mr O'Toole on as leader despite his failure to secure them a victory. ""He's gone from unknown to contender in just a few weeks,"" Mr Lietaer said. ""O'Toole was a huge underdog. To be within a few points is something we're all proud of."" Jagmeet Singh speaks alongside his pregnant wife While minority governments are common in Canada, coalitions are extremely rare and Mr Trudeau will need to compromise with opposition parties to pass legislation. The NDP are likely to be kingmakers in this new parliament, and could help the Liberals to survive key confidence votes and get their policies through. Mr Singh, the NDP leader, speaking in Burnaby, British Columbia, noted he had secured concessions from Mr Trudeau in the last parliament. He said he had a laundry list of priorities this time around, and vowed to push for action on climate change, affordable housing, and healthcare. ""You can be sure if we work together we can build a better society,"" he said. The night saw setbacks for both the Green Party and the People's Party of Canada (PPC). New Green leader Annamie Paul was badly defeated in her efforts to secure a seat in Toronto, after she struggled with internal party divisions that threatened her leadership. ""I am disappointed - it is hard to lose, no one likes to lose,"" Ms Paul said as she thanked supporters. Still, the party is still projected to send at least two members of parliament to Ottawa. The PPC failed to secure any seats despite a late surge as its populist leader tapped into a vein of anger among some Canadians over vaccine mandates and lockdown measures, but did increase its overall vote share.

"The cost of protecting customers from failing energy providers could lead to higher bills, the boss of the energy regulator Ofgem has told the BBC. It comes as energy firm Green said it was on the brink of collapse due to soaring wholesale gas prices. ""As underlying costs rise, pressure on bills does go up"", Jonathan Brearley, Ofgem chief executive said. The government has said it is looking at lending money to bigger firms to help them take on stranded customers. If an energy firm collapses, customers are automatically switched to a tariff provided by the new supplier. This is a tariff agreed with the regulator Ofgem, but it may well be more expensive than the deal they had with the former company which went bust. Mr Brearley said protecting customers of failed energy firms was the regulator's ""number one priority"". However, he said it was too early to predict how expensive it would be to ensure that they were transferred to other suppliers in an orderly way. Peter McGirr, founder and chief executive of Green, told the BBC it had appointed a restructuring firm in an attempt to survive the current crisis. Mr McGirr said the firm was in ""deep, deep trouble and our heads are unlikely to bob back to the surface"". Is the UK headed for a gas shortage this winter? What happens if my energy supplier goes bust? Why are gas prices rising? Green has 180 staff based in Newcastle upon Tyne and has 250,000 UK customers. Mr McGirr said the appointment of Alvarez and Marsal was currently on an ""advisory and restructuring"" basis, but admitted Green could fall into administration within weeks. ""We need to try to hold on long enough to get some support"", he added. The company has been in discussions with the government and energy regulator Ofgem, but has not been offered any support. Mr McGirr said he believed the larger energy suppliers had too much influence in the crisis talks being held with government and said the big companies had an interest in more of the smaller suppliers going to the wall. Asked whether these costs would be met by the taxpayer, or spread across all energy customers' bills, he said: ""We have to first of all make sure that customers are transferred and looked after and then as we see the market evolve we will understand better the cost implications."" Customers on some tariffs are protected from sudden hikes in wholesale gas prices through the energy price cap, which limits how much firms can charge per unit of gas. The price cap covers 15 million households across England, Wales and Scotland. Mr Brearley said it was too early to predict how much the energy price cap would rise next year. So far, four energy firms have gone to the wall, including People's Energy and Utility Point, and four more are expected to follow in the coming days. Industry sources fear there may be as few as 10 energy suppliers left by the end of the year, down from 70 in January. But Mr Brearley predicted that a number of small suppliers would survive the current crisis, as well as larger ones, maintaining a diverse market with plenty of choice for consumers. When asked if Ofgem was ""asleep at the wheel"" and should have prevented suppliers from making promises to customers which they wouldn't be able to keep if prices rose, Mr Brearley replied: ""No - we have always protected customers interests and we work very closely with the companies. ""We work closely with all companies to assess their financial position. And if they need to exit the market we have well-rehearsed systems and processes to manage that."" Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng earlier denied that failed energy companies would get government bailouts, saying: ""I do not think it's the right thing for taxpayers' money to be injected into companies that have been badly run."" However, he said the government was exploring the possibility of lending money to bigger energy firms to help them absorb the cost of taking on new customers from companies that had gone bust. ""If we do have this policy, they will be expected to pay back the loans,"" he added. Mr Kwarteng alsowarned many UK households could face a ""very difficult winter"",with fuel prices surging and the Â£20-a-week temporary uplift in universal credit due to end in October. How could the CO2 shortage hit food supplies? Farmers fear gas price crisis may spark pig cull The government and Ofgem have both dismissed suggestions that the cap on energy prices would be lifted ahead of an agreed 12% rise in October, saying that keeping it was the ""clear and agreed position"". The price cap is reviewed twice a year. It applies only to standard variable or default tariffs. These types of tariff are typically the most expensive plan that a supplier offers. When fixed energy deals expire, as they generally do after one or two years, customers are likely to be put on these tariffs. Customers will still continue to receive gas or electricity even if the energy supplier goes bust. Ofgem will move your account to a new supplier, but it may take a few weeks. Your new supplier should then contact you to explain what is happening with your account While you wait to hear from your new supplier: check your current balance and - if possible - download any bills; take a photo of your meter reading If you pay by direct debit, there is no need to cancel it straight away, Citizens Advice says. Wait until your new account is set up before you cancel it If you are in credit, your money is protected and you'll be paid back. If you were in debt to the old supplier, you'll still have to pay the money back to your new supplier instead Read more about the next best steps to take here. Mr Brearley said the industry had seen ""an unprecedented rise in gas prices"". ""They are almost four times what they normally are and that would put any industry under strain,"" he added. The government and Ofgem say the UK does not have gas supply problems because of a diverse range of sources ""that can more than meet demand"". However, energy bills are facing particular pressures in Great Britain because of a dip in renewable energy supplies due to low wind, as well as the outage of a power cable supplying electricity from France. The International Energy Agency has called on Russia to supply more gas to Europe, saying ""it could do more to increase gas availability to Europe and ensure storage is filled to adequate levels"", in preparation for the winter. It added: ""Based on the available information, Russia is fulfilling its long-term contracts with European counterparts - but its exports to Europe are down from their 2019 level. ""This is also an opportunity for Russia to underscore its credentials as a reliable supplier to the European market."" Stacey Stothard is waiting to see how much more she will have to pay Stacey Stothard followed all the advice. Aware that energy prices were rising, she shopped around to find a decent fixed deal for her gas and electricity. She saved Â£300 - or so she thought. Her new energy supplier went bust and now she will be switched automatically to another one, and she is facing much higher bills, potentially amounting to hundreds of pounds more a year. ""It is just like watching the meter go up and up,"" she says. ""I did the right thing - not going for the cheapest deal, but choosing a company with a decent customer service record.""

"Children struggling with mental health problems during the pandemic are facing ""agonisingly"" long waits for treatment, a BBC investigation has found. Data from half of England's services found one in five seen in the past year waited over 12 weeks for care. The situation has got so bad that parents and head teachers told the BBC they had lost faith in the system. And doctors reported distressed children were ending up at A&E as they had no where else to go. Dr Catherine Hayhurst, from the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said in many cases hospitals have been left with no option but to admit youngsters on to general wards, even though they cannot be provided with specialist mental health support there. ""Children are distressed and agitated. It's difficult to manage on the wards,"" she said. NHS England acknowledged the pandemic had been very difficult for children and young people, but it said it was in the process of significantly expanding access to services to ensure they received quick access to care. How has coronavirus affected mental health? Looking after your mental health in a pandemic Sue Peacock's teenage daughter suffers from severe anxiety and has self-harmed. She has been waiting for treatment since before the pandemic began. Ms Peacock said the situation has made her daughter feel depressed and start to become violent. ""We don't know how long it's going to be before she receives help. ""That feeling of helplessness, I can't even describe how awful as a parent it is to see that. ""You're waiting for a service that you know can help your child."" Specialist care is provided by a network known as Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS). These teams include psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses and social workers who support children with conditions ranging from anxiety and depression to schizophrenia. During 2020-21, they saw 420,000 children and young people - although an estimated 1.5 million under-18s are thought to have a mental health disorder. The waits they faced are not routinely published. But the BBC obtained data under the Freedom of Information Act from 46 of England's services, half of the total, covering just over 250,000 under 18s. The figures from April 2020 to March 2021 showed: Half of those who were seen waited longer than four weeks A fifth waited more than 12 weeks The average wait was more than two months - although in some areas it topped eight A third of the trusts also provided data on youngsters still waiting for treatment, with the numbers doubling since the end of the first lockdown in June 2020. There are signs that waiting times have improved since before the pandemic. But this is likely to be down to a drop in people coming forward for help in the first lockdown, helping services tackle the backlog in those waiting for treatment. The BBC has also been told some services closed their waiting lists altogether, meaning the true extent of the waits may be undercounted. Head teacher Michelle Catterson has lost faith with child mental health services because of the waits. She runs Moon Hall School in Surrey, which teaches children aged seven to 16 with dyslexia. ""The pandemic has been really difficult for children. But the support is just not there when they need it,"" Ms Catterson said. ""Services are completely overwhelmed as things stand currently. ""When I have parents that are in a really desperate situation, I'm often reluctant to refer them because I know the length of time that they'll have to wait, and sometimes there just isn't that opportunity to wait. ""You need that support right there, right then, to try and help the child and the family."" Emma Thomas, chief executive of the YoungMinds charity, said it was clear the waits young people were facing were ""agonising"". ""We have seen a big rise in referrals to mental health services and, as this data shows, it's clear they have been struggling to cope. The pandemic has had a huge impact on young people's mental health, exacerbating existing pressures and creating new ones. ""The young people we work with have told us that they have struggled with isolation, loneliness and concerns about the future, whilst those that experienced trauma during the lockdowns, or were already experiencing inequalities, are likely to be disproportionately affected,"" she said. NHS England said it was investing in services, which by 2023 would help support another 345,000 children and young people - on top of the 420,000 being seen currently. This includes the rollout of school mental health teams which are designed to provide earlier support to children than CAMHS services. A spokeswoman for NHS England said: ""There is no doubt that the pandemic has turned children and young people's lives upside down.""

"This video can not be played ""As soon as you see the two lines, you think of the baby that's going to come in nine months."" The first time that Sally Thompson became pregnant, she says the circumstances were not ideal. She had not been with her partner, Paul, for long and they were both living at home with their parents. Despite that, when the pregnancy ended in miscarriage at nine weeks, she felt a sense of sadness. ""It doesn't take long to get attached,"" she says. ""As soon as you kind of see the two lines or 'pregnant' on the test, you don't think of a ball of cells, you think of the baby that's going to come in nine months. ""That's what you think about and it is sad when it happens."" She says it was a confusing time, adding: ""It was lonely, because I didn't know anyone who had been through it. It was isolating because I didn't really know who to go to, to talk about it."" Sally is now 32 - she and Paul got married in 2017. She has been pregnant nine more times, but none of the pregnancies have gone to term. After each miscarriage, Sally took sick leave, as women who lose a baby before 24 weeks are entitled to do. Sally and Paul on their wedding day in 2017 While some of her employers were sympathetic, one was not and dismissed her following a lengthier absence. ""I have had kind of polar opposite experiences,"" she says. ""At that employer, miscarriage was not understood at all. It felt like they didn't care that I was coming to work and crying for 20 minutes before I even entered the building. ""My current employer is the complete opposite. I've had a miscarriage there and they could not have been kinder."" SNP MP Angela Crawley is calling on the government to give women and their partners the legal right to take three days paid leave, if a pregnancy ends before 24 weeks. This video can not be played SNP MP Angela Crawley says miscarriage should recognised as ""a loss, not an illness"". Sheintroduced a private members' bill,externalto Parliament in June, and it is due to have its first full debate in December. She says: ""I've received tonnes and tonnes of correspondence on this issue from fathers, from mothers and from families who have experienced miscarriage. ""They have outlined that, in most cases, there was a degree of stigma or shame to experiencing a miscarriage."" Many mothers took unpaid leave or sick leave, she adds, and many fathers took unpaid time off because ""they didn't feel they could approach their employer and ask for paid leave"". The government introduced paid parental leave for the loss of a baby after 24 weeks in April 2020. It entitles a parent to two weeks' leave paid at Â£151.97 a week, or 90% of their average weekly earnings, whichever is lower. A government spokesperson told the BBC the entitlement to this pay ""is a floor not a ceiling, and we urge employers to show compassion and flexibility towards women who have suffered a miscarriage, and to respond sensitively to each individual's specific needs"". NZ approves paid leave after miscarriages 'I faced miscarriage alone - my partner had to wait in the car park' What to say to someone who's lost a baby Speaking in the Commons in July this year, Boris Johnson appeared to suggest he would not be in favour of extending parental leave to those who suffered the loss of a baby earlier in the pregnancy. He said it entitled those who lost a child after 24 weeks of pregnancy to some payment. He added: ""But of course, nothing I can say and no payment we could make would be any consolation to those who experience a miscarriage in that way."" Mr Johnson's wife, Carrie, announced on social media in August that the couple had experienced a miscarriage earlier in 2021. Boris Johnson and his wife Carrie suffered a miscarriage in 2021 A policy of statutory paid leave would come at a cost. Some employers have already decided to introduce paid leave themselves. The retailer John Lewis will offer two weeks' paid leave from November to staff who experience a miscarriage at any stage of pregnancy. Nikki Humphrey, the company's executive director for people, says the business has weighed the cost and benefits. ""We know anyway that when someone experiences a loss of pregnancy they typically take time off for sick leave and so actually the bigger factor was about how do we provide the right support,"" she says. ""We clearly had to consider the financial aspect but importantly it was their whole wellbeing we considered."" Sally says she believes paid leave would have helped. ""For my early losses that may have been all the time that I would need. ""I think a lot of people, men included, would find that useful because it would give men time to be there with their partners who are going through a difficult experience."" Rhiannan lost triplets just 12 weeks in to her pregnancy Rhiannan, from Cheshire, has two sons, aged three and five. She spoke to BBC 5 Live Breakfast's Nicky Campbell about her experience of many years of infertility, IVF and miscarriages. ""One of our miscarriages was triplets through IVF,"" she told him. ""They all reached a point just before 12 weeks and their hearts stopped."" Rhiannan said there needs to be ""a lot more sensitivity"" around the issue. ""It can affect everybody in very different ways, both mentally and physically,"" she added. ""It took my body the full nine months to get over the triplet loss. ""It can also sometimes make you a bit numb - you do physically shut yourself off from a lot of feelings to cope with it"". Rhiannan said she would welcome Angela Crawley's proposed changes. ""Three days isn't necessarily enough but it's a good start and it definitely opens up the doors to it being more normal,"" she said. Nick and his wife lost a baby in December Nick, in Guildford, told BBC Radio 5 Live his wife had a miscarriage on a Saturday in December, at the start of the second lockdown. He then returned to work the following Monday. ""I went back to work a couple of days afterwards, but there was no way my wife could have,"" he said. ""You have to be there because they're the person going through it. You've got to get them out the other side, but you lose your baby at the same time. ""You have to somehow pull yourself together at the same time as you hold the person up as best you can."" Nick's manager was supportive and the company has subsequently brought in one-week of paid leave for early miscarriage. ""I had a good relationship with my manager at the time [so] I was able to tell her and she was able to help support me in that time,"" he said.

Your writers today were Doug Faulkner and Victoria Lindrea. Your editor was George Bowden. Thanks for joining us. More than 100 military personnel are set to come to the aid of the Scottish Ambulance Service. The UK government said 114 drivers and support staff would be deployed in Scotland from Saturday, along with a further 111 to operate mobile testing units. ""Our armed forces are once again stepping up, demonstrating their versatility as we support the Covid-19 response across the UK,"" said Defence Secretary Ben Wallace. ""We are proud to work alongside the dedicated men and women at the Scottish Ambulance Service as they continue to provide a lifesaving service to the people of Scotland."" The announcement from Westminster came minutes after Scotland's Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said 88 drivers and 15 support staff could be called in. Yousaf also announced a boost of Â£20 million to the ambulance service budget. Read more here. We're closing the live page soon - but before we go, here is a re-cap of the main coronavirus developments this Tuesday:  Vaccine uptake has slowed dramatically since the summer as figures show. On Monday - which saw the start of vaccinations for 12-15-year-olds in England and Scotland - 24,684 first jabs were given and 46,451 second doses were administered across the UK. Meanwhile daily deaths are rising - 203 deaths were recorded on Tuesday. Case numbers, though, are still falling, despite schools returning in both England and Wales at the start of this month. As we mentioned earlier, the firsthealthy 12 to 15-year-olds in England and Scotland began receiving Covid jabsthis week. Invites are also being sent out in Wales this week, while in Northern Ireland teen vaccinations are likely to start in October. Across the UK pupils this age are being offered a single Pfizer dose to help limit further disruption to their education. Most will receive the jab in a school setting. Evidence suggests a single dose cuts the risk of catching the Delta variant by about 55%. So will pupils still be encouraged to take lateral flow tests at home - and what happens if they test positive? And what about face coverings, social distancing and ventilation of school buildings? Everything you need to knowis here. Passes will be compulsory for those aged over 18 to enter certain events. Covid passes should be approved by the Senedd before they become compulsory, say opposition parties in Wales. From 11 October, people attending big events and nightclubs in Wales must show they are fully vaccinated or have tested negative in the previous 48 hours. The Welsh government has the powers to change the law, but the Conservatives and Plaid Cymru say Members of the Senedd (MSs) should get a vote first. Conservative shadow health minister Russell George said the Welsh government should make sure there is ""a vote in the Senedd prior to any proposed introduction and that the full details are given to members"". Plaid Cymru said it had ""consistently argued that coronavirus regulations should be agreed in the Senedd before coming into force"". Read morehere. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent There were fears September would see cases start to take
off. The return of more normal mixing patterns with schools back
and people going into the office would â some predicted â lead to a new surge. We are now two-thirds of the way through the month and the
opposite has happened â cases have fallen. Dig beneath the headline figures and there is a little more
volatility, Scotland has seen a rapid rise, but that appears to have peaked. This is now translating to falling numbers in hospital
overall â a trend which is likely to continue for the rest of the month. Deaths are averaging close to 150 a day. That may seem a
lot, but it is worth pointing out that it is similar to what you would see for
months on end during a bad flu winter. The big question now though is what happens next as the
nights draw in. There is uncertainty, but the longer cases remain in check
the more hope it gives us that UK has truly reached an equilibrium whereby the
amount of immunity built up through vaccination and natural infection is enough
to keep the virus at bay while society returns to normal. A young offender institution is declaring itself a Covid-19 ""outbreak site"" after""a high number"" of inmates tested positive for the virus. HMYOI Aylesbury, in Buckinghamshire, houses boys and men aged between 17 and 21. In a tweet it says it has ""restricted the regime"" on one wing ""as Covid has returned to the prison"". An HM Prison Service spokesman says precautionary measures are being taken at the institution in line with public health guidance. HMYOI Aylesbury says on Twitter: ""Unfortunately we have had to restrict the regime on one of our wings as Covid has returned to the prison with a high number of prisoners testing positive. ""We are now classed as an outbreak site. ""We are sorry for any impact this has on you and your loved ones as we try to contain the virus."" A further 203 deaths, among people who tested positive  for coronavirus over the past 28 days, have been reported in the UK, according tothe government's latest figures,external. In addition, 31,564 new cases were reported in the past 24 hours. In his first address to the United Nations, and against the backdrop of a once-in-a-century pandemic, US President Joe Bidenpledges cooperation with allies through ""a decisive decade for our world"". ""I believe we must work together like never before,"" he says. In the context of Covid and the growing climate crisis - both of which have sharpened global divides - Biden pushes for cooperation, saying: ""Our own success is bound up in others succeeding as well."" The 76th General Assembly in New York City is currently taking place. While the UK government announced last week plans to scrap PCR tests for returning, fully-jabbed, international travellers to England, Wales' first minister saysthis is a ""step away"" from a duty to people's health. Mark Drakeford says ministers in Wales face a ""difficult decision"" - with the nation not yet having decided whether to follow England. He says the tests allow scientists to detect new variants of the virus. From 1 October, for travellers to England, PCR tests will no longer be required on day two and this will be replaced instead by a cheaper lateral flow test. Concerns have also beenraised in Scotlandabout the change to the testing regime. Drakeford says the ""most concerning"" decision is moving away from PCR tests on day two, ""because that was the strongest defence against the re-importation of viruses from elsewhere in the world"". ""In Wales we genomic sequence a higher proportion of tests than any other part of the United Kingdom and it is that sequencing that allows the very skilled scientists who do it to identify new variations in coronavirus,"" he says. However the fact that many Welsh travellers travel to the UK via England made it a ""difficult decision"", with English ports not keen to communicate differences in rules. Simon Clarke, Conservative MP and chief secretary to the Treasury,  has defended the government decision to end the Covid Universal Credit uplift. The Â£20-a-weekincrease in Universal Credit is due to end in October,but many have criticised the government move at a time when prices and bills are rising for most households. ""All the evidence now points to a rebounding Labour market,"" Clarke tells the House of Commons. He refers to ONS figures last week ""which reported that [job] vacancies were at a record high"", adding that the unemployment rate fallen for seven consecutive months. ""People have been coming off the furlough scheme very rapidly now. Numbers are down from 5.1 million in January to 1.6 million at the end of July."" ""The furlough scheme has been absolutely essential to supporting the UK throughout this very difficult period. It has been an historic success."" But he adds: ""Broader economic growth has exceeded expectations as restrictions have been lifted."" And concludes: ""The best way to help vulnerable people is to provide them with the opportunities that they need for well-paid work."" Nadine with her brother Ash Cooper and her sister Victoria Cooper, the last time they were all together in 2019 Nadine Beasley, from Bournemouth, is one of those who have been waiting to visit her family in the US. Despite the change in travel rules she is going to miss her sisterâs wedding, for which she is maid of honour, by days. However, she will be reunited with her family at Christmas. ""My sister is getting married on 30 October in
California,"" she says. ""I was meant to be her maid of honour, my daughter a flowergirl. ""We
were due to fly out on 22 October, so we're naturally upset about the ban being
lifted in November, because we'll miss her wedding by days. ""However, we've now made our fourth rebooking since February
2020 to fly out on 20 December. So that means Christmas with my parents and my
siblings, who are all in California, which is better than the last 18 months of
waiting and knowing nothing."" With the travel ban she has not seen her siblings or parents for more than two years. She says it is annoying that she will miss her sister's wedding by days, having already missed her brother's but says the fact there is ""light at the end of the tunnel"" in the form of a date means it feels like ""a weightâs been lifted"". ""Weâre going with my nan. Itâs bittersweet because we lost
grandad,"" she adds. The UK government has borrowed record-breaking amounts to pay for measures designed to limit the impact of coronavirus. Government initiatives such as the furlough scheme are estimated to have cost up to Â£70bn by the time they come to an end on 30 September. And sadly it turns out there's no such thing as a magic money tree. So how much exactly has the government borrowed over the course of the pandemic, who has it borrowed from - and when does it have to be paid back? Find out here.

More than 16 million people have now downloaded the app, with more than 12 million in England doing so since 17 May when the Covid Pass feature to prove vaccination for events and foreign travel was added to it. Some 1.5 million people have now registered their organ donation decision through the platform, with 265,000 of those doing it via the app for the first time, according to the Department of Health and Social Care. Around 150,000 people registered their preference from May. It comes after a new ""opt-out"" organ donation system came into effect last year, known as Max and Keira's law.
The law is named after Keira Ball, who died aged nine in 2017, and Max Johnson, now aged 13, who was saved by her heart. The US will let fully vaccinated travellers from the UK - and many other countries - visit from November. The change in rules, follows a shake-up of England's travel regulations on Friday. Put simply, going overseas is becoming a little bit easier, although, as before, different rules apply for the devolved nations. So where and when can you go, what are the rules around vaccination - and what's happening with the so-called traffic light system which saw countries divided into red, amber and green categories? We have all the answershere.  Katherine SmithBBC News In England 59,000
pupils (0.7%) were absent from school in England at the end of last week
with a confirmed case of Covid, according to the latest Department for
Education attendance figures. A further 45,000 (0.5%) were absent due
to a suspected case. Some 2,000 pupils were absent due to
restrictions in place to manage a Covid outbreak. Fewer than 500 were absent
due to Covid-related school closures. At the end of last term in July, when
bubble systems were in place, more than a million children were absent for
Covid-related reasons. Those figures included 774,000 who were isolating due to
contact with a positive case in school and 81,000 who had a confirmed or
suspected case. A police photo shows the takeaway stash seized by officers New Zealand police have made a bizarre arrest after a pair of alleged gang associates were caught trying to enter Auckland with a boot full of Kentucky Fried Chicken - and tens of thousands of dollars. Under Auckland's strict Level 4 lockdown, all restaurants - including take-away services - remain closed. Police said the men, aged 23 and 30, had travelled from Hamilton, about 75 miles south of Auckland. A police spokesperson told the BBC that officers made the arrest after they noticed a suspicious-looking vehicle travelling on a gravel road on the outskirts of the city. After a chase, the vehicle was stopped and searched. Police located NZ$100,000 (US$70,000; Â£51,000) in cash, as well as at least three buckets of chicken, about 10 cups of coleslaw, a large pack of fries, and four large bags containing other KFC items. The spokesperson said that the men would appear in court for breaching public health rules later in the year - but added that further charges are also likely. The investigation is ongoing. Under New Zealand's tough anti-Covid laws, fines can reach up to NZ$4,000 and can even involve prison sentences of up to six months. Auckland will move to a Level 3 lockdown from midnight on Tuesday, but residents will remain confined to their homes unless they are attending school, work or shopping. As mask wearing on public transport continues to decline, transport unions have expressed concern that it would be difficult to
reintroduce the policy if the government decided to do so. Mike Lynch, general secretary of the RMT union said his
members had noticed a marked policy drift since the government changed the
rules in July. Even where mask wearing remains mandatory, many people were ignoring the rules, he said. He added: ""As more people see others failing to comply, the situation will escalate quickly over the autumn."" ""With the government already making compulsory
mask wearing on transport a contingency if cases escalate in the coming weeks,
there is a real danger they won't be able to get the genie back into the
bottle."" Mick Whelan, general secretary of train driversâ union Aslef, agreed there had been ""a decline, in recent days"" even where mask-wearing is ostensibly required. âWe believe mask wearing should be mandatory on
trains.To protect
passengers and staff and to control the Covid-19 pandemic."" A spokesperson for Unite. which represents bus drivers, said mask wearing was ""collapsing - and has got much worse in
recent weeks"". âIn some cases there are very few passengers wearing masks on a bus, with those
who tend to still wear a mask being older."" Unions are warning that mask wearing on public transport has dropped significantly since it no longer became a legal requirement in England in July. The proportion of people using face coverings at major railway stations is estimated to have slumped from around 80% to around 20%. A government spokesperson said the lifting of restrictions relied on people taking ""personal responsibility"". ""The guidance is clear that people are expected and recommended to wear a mask when they come into contact with people they donât normally meet in enclosed and crowded spaces. âIt is open to transport operators to decide if they want to implement their own policies, working within their particular environment.â Transport for London (TfL), in keeping with many other operators, still require members of the public to wear a mask when travelling. âCovid is still with us and we all have a role to play in doing the right thing and keeping each other safe,"" said Siwan Hayward, Director of Policing and Compliance for TfL ""Wearing a face covering on our services and in our stations is still required under TfLâs condition of carriage,"" she said. She added that ""more than 500 uniformed officers"" were enforcing mask wearing on the network and ""non-exempt customers who fail to comply may be refused travel"".  Â© 2025 BBC.

"Children struggling with mental health problems during the pandemic are facing ""agonisingly"" long waits for treatment, a BBC investigation has found. Data from half of England's services found one in five seen in the past year waited over 12 weeks for care. The situation has got so bad that parents and head teachers told the BBC they had lost faith in the system. And doctors reported distressed children were ending up at A&E as they had no where else to go. Dr Catherine Hayhurst, from the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said in many cases hospitals have been left with no option but to admit youngsters on to general wards, even though they cannot be provided with specialist mental health support there. ""Children are distressed and agitated. It's difficult to manage on the wards,"" she said. NHS England acknowledged the pandemic had been very difficult for children and young people, but it said it was in the process of significantly expanding access to services to ensure they received quick access to care. How has coronavirus affected mental health? Looking after your mental health in a pandemic Sue Peacock's teenage daughter suffers from severe anxiety and has self-harmed. She has been waiting for treatment since before the pandemic began. Ms Peacock said the situation has made her daughter feel depressed and start to become violent. ""We don't know how long it's going to be before she receives help. ""That feeling of helplessness, I can't even describe how awful as a parent it is to see that. ""You're waiting for a service that you know can help your child."" Specialist care is provided by a network known as Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS). These teams include psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses and social workers who support children with conditions ranging from anxiety and depression to schizophrenia. During 2020-21, they saw 420,000 children and young people - although an estimated 1.5 million under-18s are thought to have a mental health disorder. The waits they faced are not routinely published. But the BBC obtained data under the Freedom of Information Act from 46 of England's services, half of the total, covering just over 250,000 under 18s. The figures from April 2020 to March 2021 showed: Half of those who were seen waited longer than four weeks A fifth waited more than 12 weeks The average wait was more than two months - although in some areas it topped eight A third of the trusts also provided data on youngsters still waiting for treatment, with the numbers doubling since the end of the first lockdown in June 2020. There are signs that waiting times have improved since before the pandemic. But this is likely to be down to a drop in people coming forward for help in the first lockdown, helping services tackle the backlog in those waiting for treatment. The BBC has also been told some services closed their waiting lists altogether, meaning the true extent of the waits may be undercounted. Head teacher Michelle Catterson has lost faith with child mental health services because of the waits. She runs Moon Hall School in Surrey, which teaches children aged seven to 16 with dyslexia. ""The pandemic has been really difficult for children. But the support is just not there when they need it,"" Ms Catterson said. ""Services are completely overwhelmed as things stand currently. ""When I have parents that are in a really desperate situation, I'm often reluctant to refer them because I know the length of time that they'll have to wait, and sometimes there just isn't that opportunity to wait. ""You need that support right there, right then, to try and help the child and the family."" Emma Thomas, chief executive of the YoungMinds charity, said it was clear the waits young people were facing were ""agonising"". ""We have seen a big rise in referrals to mental health services and, as this data shows, it's clear they have been struggling to cope. The pandemic has had a huge impact on young people's mental health, exacerbating existing pressures and creating new ones. ""The young people we work with have told us that they have struggled with isolation, loneliness and concerns about the future, whilst those that experienced trauma during the lockdowns, or were already experiencing inequalities, are likely to be disproportionately affected,"" she said. NHS England said it was investing in services, which by 2023 would help support another 345,000 children and young people - on top of the 420,000 being seen currently. This includes the rollout of school mental health teams which are designed to provide earlier support to children than CAMHS services. A spokeswoman for NHS England said: ""There is no doubt that the pandemic has turned children and young people's lives upside down.""

"Votes are being counted after a snap election called by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau Canadian media including CBC and CTV project his Liberal Party will form a minority government A campaign that cost C$610m ended with the status quo reinforced in parliament Conservative Erin O'Toole made clear he wants to stay on as Opposition leader to challenge Trudeau There were long lines in some places where pandemic restrictions meant fewer polling stations More than a million Canadians voted by mail, and those votes won't be counted until Tuesday After a 35-day race, the voters have spoken. And they've decisively chosen to stick to the status quo. After Canada's most expensive federal election in history, the electoral map is largely unchanged. Preliminary results show that the Liberals actually lost three seats in this election, over what they had won in 2019. It comes after then-and-still-Prime Minster Justin Trudeau declared a snap election last month, hoping to firm up his minority government and establish a majority. But despite not winning a majority, he is still the man in charge after winning his third term. Our coverage was brought to you by BBC Canada's Holly Honderich, Jessica Murphy, Robin Levinson-King and Dan Lytwyn. After a long night of counting, Justin Trudeau's Liberal Party is projected to have won Monday's snap general election. The prime minister thanked voters for returning him to power for a third time. Justin Trudeau (C) - with his wife Sophie GrÃ©goire (L) and daughter Ella Grace (R) - waves to supporters as he celebrates his election victory It wasn't such a good night for the country's Conservative party, which came second and conceded defeat late into the night But Conservative leader Erin O'Toole - pictured here with his family watching the results come in - told supporters Canadian voters had also failed to give Trudeau the majority he wanted After weeks of campaigning - and millions of dollars spent - the initial reaction to the Canadian election results following Justin Trudeau's decision to call an early election has been somewhat scathing. ""In the end, this election was ultimately for nothing,"" University of Winnipeg politics professor Felix Mathieu told AFP, pointing to the projected seat count for each party as being similar to the split in the last parliament, with most incumbents re-elected. Pollster Tim Powers predicted a minority win for Trudeau's Liberal party, but asked: ""Is that a win for him?"" After all, he pointed out to news agency AFP, Trudeau had hoped for more than just a plurality of seats. This is also something Conservative leader Erin O'Toole noticed in his concession speech on the night. ""But tonight Canadians did not give Mr Trudeau the majority mandate he wanted,"" he said. Martin Pelletier, of investment firm Trivest Wealth Counsel, describes the election as a ""non-event"". ""The Conservatives and NDP were really focused on trying to
address the escalating cost of living crisis going on in the
country, especially in jurisdictions like Vancouver and Toronto,
whereas Justin Trudeau was heavily focused on climate change
initiatives. I thought that cost of living would resonate more
with voters,"" he told Reuters. ""This is a non-event. We're getting more of the same as what
we had before."" Thirty-six days and C$610m ($476m; Â£348m) later, it looks like Canadians are right back where they started. Justin Trudeau's snap election has delivered the status quo: another Liberal minority government. The situation up north bears some similarities to last week's recall election in California. An estimated C$352m ($276m; Â£201m) was spent while voters determined the fate of Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom. But after months of campaigning, voters in the Golden State also ended up with more of the same: two more years of Newsom. Although Justin Trudeau will stay on as Canada's prime minister, there have been a few upsets tonight. Jessica MurphyBBC News, Montreal, QuÃ©bec Trudeau (right) cast his ballot in Montreal, joined by his family Canadian elections may not get the same global attention as those in the US and Europe - but that doesnât mean that the outcome of todayâs vote wonât have a global impact. Whoever ends up in charge in Ottawa, the national capital and seat of the federal government, will be making decisions on matters like climate and free trade, where the next Canadian government will seek to deepen its economic partnerships. The Conservative leader, Erin OâToole, for example, has said he would push to join the US, UK and Australia in their recently announced security pact.  Heâs also supportive of pursuing the so-called Canzuk trade deal with Australia, New Zealand and the UK. Trudeau and the Liberals have pledged to deepen diplomatic, economic, and defence partnerships in the Asia-Pacific region. The country is also a G7 and G20 member and a partner in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (Nato), in Norad, a maritime and aerospace advanced warning system with the US, and in the Five Eyes alliance. And Canada is an Arctic nation, sharing interest in the region with countries like Russia, the US, Norway and Sweden even as the north opens up due to a changing climate. How much of an emphasis Canada will place on its Arctic sovereignty and security could depend on who wins today's election. (The Liberal platform makes three mentions of the country's Arctic region, the Conservative platform has 30). Jessica MurphyBBC News, Montreal, QuÃ©bec After a five-week campaign, the parliament that Canadians have elected this time around looks strikingly similar to the one they voted for in 2019. Justin Trudeau has retained power but is still short of a majority. The Conservatives will have won the popular vote but failed to secure enough seats to topple Trudeau's Liberals. While results will continue to trickle in over the coming days as election officials tally the mail-in ballots, in the end little is projected to have changed in the overall seat count for each party beyond a few marginal wins and losses. Still, Trudeau painted this early election call as a victory in his speech to supporters in the early morning hours on Tuesday, telling them that ""what we've seen tonight is millions of Canadians [who] have chosen a progressive plan"". We saw an unusual sight for a Canadian election today: long lines. Some voters reportedly had to wait up to two hours while trying to cast their ballots - primarily due to voting modifications that were a result of the pandemic. But there's good news: Elections Canada has just announced that all Canadians waiting in line have been able to cast their ballots. Bernd DebusmannBBC News, Washington He managed to get another win for the Liberals this time, but Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is likely to ""get out of the way"" in several years, according to Canadian author and political theorist David Moscrop. Moscrop told the BBC that the ""traditional trajectory"" would be to stay on for a period of time before allowing a new leader to come in and call an election. ""That would be a year or 18 months. That new leader would have a chance to get their own parliament, whether majority or minority,"" he said. Such an outcome, he added, would be ""fairly consistent with Canadian history"". In Trudeauâs case, Moscrop said that it is ""plausible"" that the Liberals choose Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland as their leader in the near future before heading to another election. ""We've all worked so hard over the last few weeks and the last few years. And we've come so far,"" Trudeau continues as he addresses supporters in Montreal. ""Let us not forget the past and the dark days we have come through together. But let us still look to the future and all that is still to come and all that we have still to build together,"" he says. ""Let us work together. And let us seize the promise of a brand new day."" With that, his speech has ended. Trudeau begins by thanking Canadians for voting ""to send Canada through this pandemic and to the brighter days ahead"". He mentions the issues important to his party's platform - climate action, affordable homes and childcare - and promises to continue to work on them. ""You have given this government and this parliament clear direction,"" he says. Switching between English and French, he addresses the nation from a hotel ballroom in Montreal, Quebec. The room is adorned in red, the colour of the Liberals. Trudeau thanks his political opponents: ""Thank you for being part of this important moment."" ""Political life isn't easy,"" he continues, adding: ""Thank you for your service."" Liberal Party Leader Justin Trudeau is now up on the stage. He is joined by his wife. It is his third time winning a federal election. He will remain Canada's prime minister, but he did not manage to take the majority of seats that he hoped to when he called a snap election last month. Robin Levinson KingBBC News, Toronto, Ontario NDP leader Jagmeet Singh For the first time in a decade, the NDP will have more seats in parliament than they had at the start of the election, picking up an additional three seats for a projected total of 27. The left-leaning party reached an all-time high in 2011, rising to be the official opposition when they won 103 seats in the House of Commons. They failed to keep up that momentum, losing seats in each subsequent election down to a low of 24 in 2019. Leader Jagmeet Singh has made small growth for the party by being a progressive voice in contrast to Trudeau's more centrist Liberals. ""We will never stop fighting for you,"" he said in his speech, promising to campaign for affordability and a tax on the rich. Singh made history by becoming the first non-white leader of a federal party in Canada in 2017. Recently, he picked up the endorsement of a fellow left-of centre politician, US Senator and former presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders. Singh vowed to keep fighting New Democratic Party (NDP) Leader Jagmeet Singh takes the stage along with his pregnant wife. The pair are expecting their first child. Singh starts his remarks by congratulating Trudeau, and promising to ""keep fighting to make sure that the super wealthy pay their fair share"". ""We're gonna fight for you. We've seen you. We've heard your stories. We're going to fight for you,"" he says. He vows to address the climate crisis and healthcare. ""That's what the New Democrats are all about."" After he finishes speaking, the couple is joined on stage by dancing supporters and the music is cranked up. Bloc Quebecois Leader Yves-Francois Blanchet is now speaking. ""The result is hard to comment on,"" he says in French, adding that the number of seats held by the party are approximately the same as what they had before this election. ""So what this all means isâ¦ we will have to do more and do better. The people of Quebec expect that we will do this,"" he adds. His party, which only runs candidates in Quebec, holds third place for seats in the House of Commons. He continues that provinces should not be ""held hostage"" to the federal government in Ottawa, and calls for ""more money for the healthcare system"". Holly HonderichBBC News, Oshawa, Ontario Erin O'Toole is getting his biggest applause of the night, promising to build a Conservative tent that includes all Canadians. This was central to O'Toole's election pitch: a more moderate, inclusive conservatism - especially on social issues like LGBT and women's rights. The Conservative party ""must have the courage to change"", he says. While O'Toole acknowledges his defeat, his tone is defiant. At times, the speech sounds more like a campaign launch than a concession. ""Whenever the next election comes, Iâll be ready to lead the Conservative party to victory,"" he says. One thing is clear: O'Toole has no plans to step down after tonight's loss. Holly HonderichBBC News, Oshawa, Ontario The Conservative leader starts his speech with a critique of Liberal leader Justin Trudeau and his snap election. Trudeau was looking for a ""quick power grab"", O'Toole says. ""But Canadians did not give Trudeau the majority mandate he wanted."" O'Toole, who will be Canada's opposition leader once again, is reframing his electoral loss as a win: he and his party denied Trudeau the majority he sought in calling the early election. He says the Conservatives are projected to win the popular vote once again, but concedes there is ""more work for us to do"" to hold government. It's a friendly crowd here at headquarters. O'Toole, 48, was met by a standing ovation as the crowd shouted his name. As he speaks, they're listening intently and cheering at each turn of O'Toole's speech. Erin O'Toole The Conservative leader Erin O'Toole has just taken the stage with his wife and two children. Earlier tonight he won his parliamentary seat, but his party has failed to win enough seats to prevent Trudeau's Liberal Party from staying in power. Moments ago, O'Toole is said to have called Trudeau to concede the race. We've just heard from the Green Party leader, and soon we'll go to the Conservatives. Conservative leader Erin O'Toole will address supporters imminently from his election night headquarters in Oshawa, Ontario. Liberal leader Justin Trudeau is due to speak at 00:30 EST (05:15 GMT) from a hotel in Montreal. Green Party leader Annamie Paul Green Party leader Annamie Paul has spoken to a group of her supporters after coming in fourth place in her own race. ""We're sending two hopefully three greens back to Ottawa,"" she said, saying the  party should celebrate that achievement. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Justin Trudeau: ""Millions of Canadians have chosen a progressive plan"" Justin Trudeau's Liberal Party has narrowly won Canada's election, but it failed to secure a majority of seats. This is Mr Trudeau's third federal election win, but his critics say the poll was a waste of time. The Liberals are projected to win 158 seats, short of the 170 seats needed for the majority Mr Trudeau was seeking with his early election call. The Conservatives have held onto their main opposition status and are expected to win about 122 seats. ""There are still votes to be counted but what we've seen tonight is millions of Canadians have chosen a progressive plan,"" Mr Trudeau told supporters in Montreal in the early hours of Tuesday morning. ""You elected a government that will fight for you and deliver for you,"" he said. The election, which took place during a fourth pandemic wave in Canada, was the most expensive in the country's history, costing some C$600m ($470m; Â£344m). The projected results suggest a parliament strikingly similar to the one elected just two years ago in 2019. The snap election call, sending Canadians to the polls for the second time in two years, was widely seen as a bid by Mr Trudeau to secure a majority government and he struggled to explain why a campaign was necessary. Conservative leader Erin O'Toole suggested it was a waste of time and money. ""Canadians sent him back with another minority at a cost of $600m and deeper divisions in our great country"", he told reporters. Mr Trudeau maintained that the election gave the incoming government a clear mandate in moving forward. But over the course of the campaign, he struggled to convince voters of the need for an election, which also coincided with rising Covid-19 case loads due to the Delta variant. Separately he was also heckled by anti-vaccine protesters on the campaign trail, with some shouting they would refuse the Covid jab. While questions will inevitably be raised about Mr Trudeau's political future, Liberal MP Pablo Rodriguez told journalists early in the evening that no matter the outcome, he had  ""100% confidence"" in him as Liberal Party leader. ""And all the members of the party do as well,"" he said. The country's left-wing New Democrats (NDP), which ran on a ""tax the ultra-rich"" message with leader Jagmeet Singh trying to tap into progressive voters frustrated with the Liberals, looks to have picked up a small number of seats. Vote counts will continue to trickle in over the coming days as elections officials tally the roughly one million mail-in ballots cast this election, and current seat tallies are still to be finalised. Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole speaks from Oshawa, Ontario For the Conservatives, the result is a disappointment for new party leader Erin O'Toole, who ran on a centrist message in a bid to expand the party's base of support. Like in 2019, the party is projected to have won the popular vote. But the first-past-the-post system - awarding victory to the candidate with most votes in any given constituency - means that has not translated to seats won. Speaking to party faithful in Oshawa, Ontario, a defiant Mr O'Toole pitched his vision for a bigger Conservative tent, saying: ""Our party needed the courage to change because Canada has changed."" He urged supporters not to waiver from the commitment to grow the party's base, acknowledging that ""clearly there is more work for us to do"" in setting the stage for a better showing in the next campaign. Election night - as it happened Trudeau - a life in politics The man who hoped to topple Trudeau Conservative strategist Jason Lietaer told journalists at party headquarters that there's reason to keep  Mr O'Toole on as leader despite his failure to secure them a victory. ""He's gone from unknown to contender in just a few weeks,"" Mr Lietaer said. ""O'Toole was a huge underdog. To be within a few points is something we're all proud of."" Jagmeet Singh speaks alongside his pregnant wife While minority governments are common in Canada, coalitions are extremely rare and Mr Trudeau will need to compromise with opposition parties to pass legislation. The NDP are likely to be kingmakers in this new parliament, and could help the Liberals to survive key confidence votes and get their policies through. Mr Singh, the NDP leader, speaking in Burnaby, British Columbia, noted he had secured concessions from Mr Trudeau in the last parliament. He said he had a laundry list of priorities this time around, and vowed to push for action on climate change, affordable housing, and healthcare. ""You can be sure if we work together we can build a better society,"" he said. The night saw setbacks for both the Green Party and the People's Party of Canada (PPC). New Green leader Annamie Paul was badly defeated in her efforts to secure a seat in Toronto, after she struggled with internal party divisions that threatened her leadership. ""I am disappointed - it is hard to lose, no one likes to lose,"" Ms Paul said as she thanked supporters. Still, the party is still projected to send at least two members of parliament to Ottawa. The PPC failed to secure any seats despite a late surge as its populist leader tapped into a vein of anger among some Canadians over vaccine mandates and lockdown measures, but did increase its overall vote share.

"This video can not be played ""As soon as you see the two lines, you think of the baby that's going to come in nine months."" The first time that Sally Thompson became pregnant, she says the circumstances were not ideal. She had not been with her partner, Paul, for long and they were both living at home with their parents. Despite that, when the pregnancy ended in miscarriage at nine weeks, she felt a sense of sadness. ""It doesn't take long to get attached,"" she says. ""As soon as you kind of see the two lines or 'pregnant' on the test, you don't think of a ball of cells, you think of the baby that's going to come in nine months. ""That's what you think about and it is sad when it happens."" She says it was a confusing time, adding: ""It was lonely, because I didn't know anyone who had been through it. It was isolating because I didn't really know who to go to, to talk about it."" Sally is now 32 - she and Paul got married in 2017. She has been pregnant nine more times, but none of the pregnancies have gone to term. After each miscarriage, Sally took sick leave, as women who lose a baby before 24 weeks are entitled to do. Sally and Paul on their wedding day in 2017 While some of her employers were sympathetic, one was not and dismissed her following a lengthier absence. ""I have had kind of polar opposite experiences,"" she says. ""At that employer, miscarriage was not understood at all. It felt like they didn't care that I was coming to work and crying for 20 minutes before I even entered the building. ""My current employer is the complete opposite. I've had a miscarriage there and they could not have been kinder."" SNP MP Angela Crawley is calling on the government to give women and their partners the legal right to take three days paid leave, if a pregnancy ends before 24 weeks. This video can not be played SNP MP Angela Crawley says miscarriage should recognised as ""a loss, not an illness"". Sheintroduced a private members' bill,externalto Parliament in June, and it is due to have its first full debate in December. She says: ""I've received tonnes and tonnes of correspondence on this issue from fathers, from mothers and from families who have experienced miscarriage. ""They have outlined that, in most cases, there was a degree of stigma or shame to experiencing a miscarriage."" Many mothers took unpaid leave or sick leave, she adds, and many fathers took unpaid time off because ""they didn't feel they could approach their employer and ask for paid leave"". The government introduced paid parental leave for the loss of a baby after 24 weeks in April 2020. It entitles a parent to two weeks' leave paid at Â£151.97 a week, or 90% of their average weekly earnings, whichever is lower. A government spokesperson told the BBC the entitlement to this pay ""is a floor not a ceiling, and we urge employers to show compassion and flexibility towards women who have suffered a miscarriage, and to respond sensitively to each individual's specific needs"". NZ approves paid leave after miscarriages 'I faced miscarriage alone - my partner had to wait in the car park' What to say to someone who's lost a baby Speaking in the Commons in July this year, Boris Johnson appeared to suggest he would not be in favour of extending parental leave to those who suffered the loss of a baby earlier in the pregnancy. He said it entitled those who lost a child after 24 weeks of pregnancy to some payment. He added: ""But of course, nothing I can say and no payment we could make would be any consolation to those who experience a miscarriage in that way."" Mr Johnson's wife, Carrie, announced on social media in August that the couple had experienced a miscarriage earlier in 2021. Boris Johnson and his wife Carrie suffered a miscarriage in 2021 A policy of statutory paid leave would come at a cost. Some employers have already decided to introduce paid leave themselves. The retailer John Lewis will offer two weeks' paid leave from November to staff who experience a miscarriage at any stage of pregnancy. Nikki Humphrey, the company's executive director for people, says the business has weighed the cost and benefits. ""We know anyway that when someone experiences a loss of pregnancy they typically take time off for sick leave and so actually the bigger factor was about how do we provide the right support,"" she says. ""We clearly had to consider the financial aspect but importantly it was their whole wellbeing we considered."" Sally says she believes paid leave would have helped. ""For my early losses that may have been all the time that I would need. ""I think a lot of people, men included, would find that useful because it would give men time to be there with their partners who are going through a difficult experience."" Rhiannan lost triplets just 12 weeks in to her pregnancy Rhiannan, from Cheshire, has two sons, aged three and five. She spoke to BBC 5 Live Breakfast's Nicky Campbell about her experience of many years of infertility, IVF and miscarriages. ""One of our miscarriages was triplets through IVF,"" she told him. ""They all reached a point just before 12 weeks and their hearts stopped."" Rhiannan said there needs to be ""a lot more sensitivity"" around the issue. ""It can affect everybody in very different ways, both mentally and physically,"" she added. ""It took my body the full nine months to get over the triplet loss. ""It can also sometimes make you a bit numb - you do physically shut yourself off from a lot of feelings to cope with it"". Rhiannan said she would welcome Angela Crawley's proposed changes. ""Three days isn't necessarily enough but it's a good start and it definitely opens up the doors to it being more normal,"" she said. Nick and his wife lost a baby in December Nick, in Guildford, told BBC Radio 5 Live his wife had a miscarriage on a Saturday in December, at the start of the second lockdown. He then returned to work the following Monday. ""I went back to work a couple of days afterwards, but there was no way my wife could have,"" he said. ""You have to be there because they're the person going through it. You've got to get them out the other side, but you lose your baby at the same time. ""You have to somehow pull yourself together at the same time as you hold the person up as best you can."" Nick's manager was supportive and the company has subsequently brought in one-week of paid leave for early miscarriage. ""I had a good relationship with my manager at the time [so] I was able to tell her and she was able to help support me in that time,"" he said.

"Asian stocks were mixed on Tuesday as concerns persisted over Chinese property group Evergrande and its impact on the global markets. Japan's Nikkei 225 index closed 2.2% lower, but Hong Kong's Hang Seng index regained earlier losses to end up 0.5%. There are concerns that Evergrande - a major Chinese property developer - is struggling to meet interest payments on more than $300bn of debts. Regulators have warned it could affect the country's financial system. Investors fear that this could hit big banks exposed to Evergrande and companies like it, causing contagion in global markets. What is Evergrande and is it too big to fail? The jitters among the markets also come as the global economy is still recovering from the impact of the coronavirus. On Monday, the Dow Jones index in the US ended 1.8% lower. That followed similar falls in Europe, with Germany's Dax index losing 2.3%, and the Cac 40 in France down 1.7%. Major stock exchanges in mainland China were closed on Monday and Tuesday for the annual mid-Autumn festival. Despite the recent falls, Japan's Nikkei is up by almost 30% compared to a year ago. ""The fear of an Evergrande bankruptcy appears to be leading to concern about China's very own Lehman [Brothers] moment, and a big overspill across the region,"" said Michael Hewson of CMC Markets. Investors are also nervous that the US Federal Reserve, which meets on Tuesday and Wednesday, will confirm plans to cut back support for the US economy this year. Global stocks have rallied as economies reopen and central banks have provided trillions of dollars in support to boost growth. But there are concerns of a decline if support is taken away at a time when the Delta variant of coronavirus continues to drag on recovery. Strategists at Morgan Stanley said they expected a 10% correction in America's S&P 500 index as the Fed starts to unwind its support. They added that signs of a stalling recovery could deepen that slide to 20%. However, other analysts played down fears of a rout, noting that September is typically a bad months for stocks. ""Overall, September continues to live up to its bad reputation as historically the weakest month of the year. But that doesn't mean it can't rebound,"" said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade. And Lindsey Bell of Ally Invest said any pullback may be short-lived. ""Much of investing is about sorting through what's signal and what's noise,"" she said. ""While there is concern about the Evergrande situation infecting global markets, for the long-term investor, this situation may just be noise."" Why should I care if Evergrande collapses?

"The cost of protecting customers from failing energy providers could lead to higher bills, the boss of the energy regulator Ofgem has told the BBC. It comes as energy firm Green said it was on the brink of collapse due to soaring wholesale gas prices. ""As underlying costs rise, pressure on bills does go up"", Jonathan Brearley, Ofgem chief executive said. The government has said it is looking at lending money to bigger firms to help them take on stranded customers. If an energy firm collapses, customers are automatically switched to a tariff provided by the new supplier. This is a tariff agreed with the regulator Ofgem, but it may well be more expensive than the deal they had with the former company which went bust. Mr Brearley said protecting customers of failed energy firms was the regulator's ""number one priority"". However, he said it was too early to predict how expensive it would be to ensure that they were transferred to other suppliers in an orderly way. Peter McGirr, founder and chief executive of Green, told the BBC it had appointed a restructuring firm in an attempt to survive the current crisis. Mr McGirr said the firm was in ""deep, deep trouble and our heads are unlikely to bob back to the surface"". Is the UK headed for a gas shortage this winter? What happens if my energy supplier goes bust? Why are gas prices rising? Green has 180 staff based in Newcastle upon Tyne and has 250,000 UK customers. Mr McGirr said the appointment of Alvarez and Marsal was currently on an ""advisory and restructuring"" basis, but admitted Green could fall into administration within weeks. ""We need to try to hold on long enough to get some support"", he added. The company has been in discussions with the government and energy regulator Ofgem, but has not been offered any support. Mr McGirr said he believed the larger energy suppliers had too much influence in the crisis talks being held with government and said the big companies had an interest in more of the smaller suppliers going to the wall. Asked whether these costs would be met by the taxpayer, or spread across all energy customers' bills, he said: ""We have to first of all make sure that customers are transferred and looked after and then as we see the market evolve we will understand better the cost implications."" Customers on some tariffs are protected from sudden hikes in wholesale gas prices through the energy price cap, which limits how much firms can charge per unit of gas. The price cap covers 15 million households across England, Wales and Scotland. Mr Brearley said it was too early to predict how much the energy price cap would rise next year. So far, four energy firms have gone to the wall, including People's Energy and Utility Point, and four more are expected to follow in the coming days. Industry sources fear there may be as few as 10 energy suppliers left by the end of the year, down from 70 in January. But Mr Brearley predicted that a number of small suppliers would survive the current crisis, as well as larger ones, maintaining a diverse market with plenty of choice for consumers. When asked if Ofgem was ""asleep at the wheel"" and should have prevented suppliers from making promises to customers which they wouldn't be able to keep if prices rose, Mr Brearley replied: ""No - we have always protected customers interests and we work very closely with the companies. ""We work closely with all companies to assess their financial position. And if they need to exit the market we have well-rehearsed systems and processes to manage that."" Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng earlier denied that failed energy companies would get government bailouts, saying: ""I do not think it's the right thing for taxpayers' money to be injected into companies that have been badly run."" However, he said the government was exploring the possibility of lending money to bigger energy firms to help them absorb the cost of taking on new customers from companies that had gone bust. ""If we do have this policy, they will be expected to pay back the loans,"" he added. Mr Kwarteng alsowarned many UK households could face a ""very difficult winter"",with fuel prices surging and the Â£20-a-week temporary uplift in universal credit due to end in October. How could the CO2 shortage hit food supplies? Farmers fear gas price crisis may spark pig cull The government and Ofgem have both dismissed suggestions that the cap on energy prices would be lifted ahead of an agreed 12% rise in October, saying that keeping it was the ""clear and agreed position"". The price cap is reviewed twice a year. It applies only to standard variable or default tariffs. These types of tariff are typically the most expensive plan that a supplier offers. When fixed energy deals expire, as they generally do after one or two years, customers are likely to be put on these tariffs. Customers will still continue to receive gas or electricity even if the energy supplier goes bust. Ofgem will move your account to a new supplier, but it may take a few weeks. Your new supplier should then contact you to explain what is happening with your account While you wait to hear from your new supplier: check your current balance and - if possible - download any bills; take a photo of your meter reading If you pay by direct debit, there is no need to cancel it straight away, Citizens Advice says.

Mr Brearley said the industry had seen ""an unprecedented rise in gas prices"". ""They are almost four times what they normally are and that would put any industry under strain,"" he added. The government and Ofgem say the UK does not have gas supply problems because of a diverse range of sources ""that can more than meet demand"". However, energy bills are facing particular pressures in Great Britain because of a dip in renewable energy supplies due to low wind, as well as the outage of a power cable supplying electricity from France. The International Energy Agency has called on Russia to supply more gas to Europe, saying ""it could do more to increase gas availability to Europe and ensure storage is filled to adequate levels"", in preparation for the winter. It added: ""Based on the available information, Russia is fulfilling its long-term contracts with European counterparts - but its exports to Europe are down from their 2019 level.

"""When it goes wrong, it really does go wrong - one wrong move, one throwaway comment and months of planning and international diplomacy are in the bin."" No stress then! As one former Downing Street senior staff member recalls, visits to the White House are about as high pressure as it gets. British prime ministers always lavish praise on the importance of the relationship with the US. So when it's time for an invite to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue the pressure is really on. In the run up to the big event, warm words are the order of the day. Today is no exception. Boris Johnson told the travelling press pack that the relationship between the two countries is as ""good as it has been for decades"", claiming his relationship with President Biden is ""genuinely terrific"", and joking the two have bonded over their love of rail - ""he's a train nut"". There's bonhomie, and - having witnessed the two at the G7 in Cornwall - it is visible. The UK camp is encouraged atthe American removal of travel restrictions on UK citizens in November. And there's a sense that the president might be ready to make extra commitments on climate finance which would thrill Downing Street. But nothing is that straightforward. Increase climate commitments, PM to urge Biden They'll have to confront tensions over the handling of the withdrawal of forces in Afghanistan. And the UK doesn't expect much progress on trade either, saying American negotiators are ""ruthless"", playing down expectations of things moving forward. But first and foremost both sides will want Tuesday's big meeting to go smoothly. No gaffes, no misunderstandings, no embarrassments. Whatever the personal friendships or frictions between the two main protagonists, it matters because, as one No 10 insider told me, ""the relationship matters for the mutual benefit of our people"". The current Downing Street team don't seem to be nervous about the meeting on Tuesday, at least outwardly, but they are conscious of how much it matters, and how previously things have gone awry. Who could forget the last time a British prime minister held talks in the Oval Office? The press conference back in 2017 was quite the experience. This video can not be played President Trump joked about the special relationship with the UK What you might not know was that Theresa May's team was worried about the menu - because the ribs on offer at the getting-to-know-you lunch might plaster barbecue sauce all over the then prime minster's face during the huge TV moment. They discovered the meat was ""neatly chopped"" after all. Or that former President Trump anti-bacced his hands after shaking hands with Theresa May's team - one of them now jokes ""he was ahead of his time"". Or indeed, that ""May bossed her foreign secretary around on the plane on the way, talking down to him in front of others, and yet he is the man now in charge"". Ouch! For David Cameron's team there were similar stresses, and frankly high farce. After ""endless discussions about photo ops"", one member of his team remembers, the two men took Air Force One to a college basketball game, putting David Cameron under unfamiliar pressure when he had to give a half-time interview about the match on a ""subject he knew nothing about"". This video can not be played President Barack Obama has given British Prime Minister David Cameron a front row seat at the US college basketball championships Money couldn't buy these kind of images for a British prime minister - putting them on the spot over alley-oops or a 5-out motion, less desirable altogether. And that's before you factor in the British reaction back then to the mere name of the White House protocol supremo, Randy Bumgardner, to the bemusement of the Americans. Two nations divided perhaps not just by a common language, but by different senses of humour too. So, there is a lot at stake - the risk of misunderstanding, disagreement on policy, a clash of political personality, or just blunders that cause blushes. As one of those who felt it go wrong to their cost told me, ""it's important to be on best behaviour"". Mr Johnson has been to the White House before, as foreign secretary in 2019. But so much has changed then, on this side of the Atlantic and at home. A very different prime minister. A very different president. A very different set of challenges for the world. And British prime ministers' visits to the White House are, as occasions in themselves, about as momentous as it gets.

"The cost of protecting customers from failing energy providers could lead to higher bills, the boss of the energy regulator Ofgem has told the BBC. It comes as energy firm Green said it was on the brink of collapse due to soaring wholesale gas prices. ""As underlying costs rise, pressure on bills does go up"", Jonathan Brearley, Ofgem chief executive said. The government has said it is looking at lending money to bigger firms to help them take on stranded customers. If an energy firm collapses, customers are automatically switched to a tariff provided by the new supplier. This is a tariff agreed with the regulator Ofgem, but it may well be more expensive than the deal they had with the former company which went bust. Mr Brearley said protecting customers of failed energy firms was the regulator's ""number one priority"". However, he said it was too early to predict how expensive it would be to ensure that they were transferred to other suppliers in an orderly way. Peter McGirr, founder and chief executive of Green, told the BBC it had appointed a restructuring firm in an attempt to survive the current crisis. Mr McGirr said the firm was in ""deep, deep trouble and our heads are unlikely to bob back to the surface"". Is the UK headed for a gas shortage this winter? What happens if my energy supplier goes bust? Why are gas prices rising? Green has 180 staff based in Newcastle upon Tyne and has 250,000 UK customers. Mr McGirr said the appointment of Alvarez and Marsal was currently on an ""advisory and restructuring"" basis, but admitted Green could fall into administration within weeks. ""We need to try to hold on long enough to get some support"", he added. The company has been in discussions with the government and energy regulator Ofgem, but has not been offered any support. Mr McGirr said he believed the larger energy suppliers had too much influence in the crisis talks being held with government and said the big companies had an interest in more of the smaller suppliers going to the wall. Asked whether these costs would be met by the taxpayer, or spread across all energy customers' bills, he said: ""We have to first of all make sure that customers are transferred and looked after and then as we see the market evolve we will understand better the cost implications."" Customers on some tariffs are protected from sudden hikes in wholesale gas prices through the energy price cap, which limits how much firms can charge per unit of gas. The price cap covers 15 million households across England, Wales and Scotland. Mr Brearley said it was too early to predict how much the energy price cap would rise next year. So far, four energy firms have gone to the wall, including People's Energy and Utility Point, and four more are expected to follow in the coming days. Industry sources fear there may be as few as 10 energy suppliers left by the end of the year, down from 70 in January. But Mr Brearley predicted that a number of small suppliers would survive the current crisis, as well as larger ones, maintaining a diverse market with plenty of choice for consumers. When asked if Ofgem was ""asleep at the wheel"" and should have prevented suppliers from making promises to customers which they wouldn't be able to keep if prices rose, Mr Brearley replied: ""No - we have always protected customers interests and we work very closely with the companies. ""We work closely with all companies to assess their financial position. And if they need to exit the market we have well-rehearsed systems and processes to manage that."" Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng earlier denied that failed energy companies would get government bailouts, saying: ""I do not think it's the right thing for taxpayers' money to be injected into companies that have been badly run."" However, he said the government was exploring the possibility of lending money to bigger energy firms to help them absorb the cost of taking on new customers from companies that had gone bust. ""If we do have this policy, they will be expected to pay back the loans,"" he added. Mr Kwarteng alsowarned many UK households could face a ""very difficult winter"",with fuel prices surging and the Â£20-a-week temporary uplift in universal credit due to end in October. How could the CO2 shortage hit food supplies? Farmers fear gas price crisis may spark pig cull The government and Ofgem have both dismissed suggestions that the cap on energy prices would be lifted ahead of an agreed 12% rise in October, saying that keeping it was the ""clear and agreed position"". The price cap is reviewed twice a year. It applies only to standard variable or default tariffs. These types of tariff are typically the most expensive plan that a supplier offers. When fixed energy deals expire, as they generally do after one or two years, customers are likely to be put on these tariffs. Customers will still continue to receive gas or electricity even if the energy supplier goes bust. Ofgem will move your account to a new supplier, but it may take a few weeks. Your new supplier should then contact you to explain what is happening with your account While you wait to hear from your new supplier: check your current balance and - if possible - download any bills; take a photo of your meter reading If you pay by direct debit, there is no need to cancel it straight away, Citizens Advice says. Wait until your new account is set up before you cancel it If you are in credit, your money is protected and you'll be paid back. If you were in debt to the old supplier, you'll still have to pay the money back to your new supplier instead Read more about the next best steps to take here. Mr Brearley said the industry had seen ""an unprecedented rise in gas prices"". ""They are almost four times what they normally are and that would put any industry under strain,"" he added. The government and Ofgem say the UK does not have gas supply problems because of a diverse range of sources ""that can more than meet demand"". However, energy bills are facing particular pressures in Great Britain because of a dip in renewable energy supplies due to low wind, as well as the outage of a power cable supplying electricity from France. The International Energy Agency has called on Russia to supply more gas to Europe, saying ""it could do more to increase gas availability to Europe and ensure storage is filled to adequate levels"", in preparation for the winter. It added: ""Based on the available information, Russia is fulfilling its long-term contracts with European counterparts - but its exports to Europe are down from their 2019 level. ""This is also an opportunity for Russia to underscore its credentials as a reliable supplier to the European market."" Stacey Stothard is waiting to see how much more she will have to pay Stacey Stothard followed all the advice. Aware that energy prices were rising, she shopped around to find a decent fixed deal for her gas and electricity. She saved Â£300 - or so she thought. Her new energy supplier went bust and now she will be switched automatically to another one, and she is facing much higher bills, potentially amounting to hundreds of pounds more a year. ""It is just like watching the meter go up and up,"" she says. ""I did the right thing - not going for the cheapest deal, but choosing a company with a decent customer service record.""

"The new air travel rules will come into effect in November The US is easing its coronavirus travel restrictions, reopening to passengers from the UK, EU and other nations. From November, foreign travellers will be allowed to fly into the US if they are fully vaccinated, and undergo testing and contact tracing. The US has had tough restrictions on travel in place since early last year. The move answers a major demand from European allies, and means that families and friends separated by the restrictions can be reunited. ""It's a happy day - Big Apple, here I come!"" French entrepreneur Stephane Le Breton told the Associated Press news agency, as he looked forward to a trip to New York City that had been put on hold because of the restrictions. White House Covid-19 co-ordinator Jeff Zients announced the new rules on Monday, saying: ""This is based on individuals rather than a country-based approach, so it's a stronger system."" ""Most importantly, foreign nationals flying to the US will be required to be fully vaccinated,"" he said. US restrictions were initially imposed on travellers from China in early 2020, and then extended to other countries. The current rules bar entry to most non-US citizens who have been in the UK and a number of other European countries, China, India, South Africa, Iran and Brazil within the last 14 days. Under the new rules, foreign travellers will need to demonstrate proof of vaccination before flying, obtain a negative Covid-19 test result within three days of travelling, and provide their contact information. They will not be required to quarantine. Officials said there would be some exceptions to the new policy, including for children who are not eligible to be vaccinated. It was not immediately clear if the new rules applied only to US-approved vaccines, with Mr Zients saying this would be determined by the US Centers for Disease Control. A White House source told the BBC that the question of whether people who have had the AstraZeneca vaccine or 12- to 18-year-olds who have only had one jab would be allowed in under the new rules was a level of ""granular detail"" that was still being worked out, though this would affect millions. Americans who are not fully vaccinated will still be able to enter, but they will need to be tested before their return to the US, and after they arrive home. Mr Zients said the policy would come into effect in early November, but did not give an exact date. The new rules do not apply to land borders, meaning that restrictions continue to apply to cross-border travel with Canada and Mexico. IN CHARTS:Where are Covid cases the highest? EXPLAINED:Travel update: Can we go to the US now? FEATURE:Getting Covid in a land where no cases officially exist The easing of travel rules came as a surprise to many, after the US government last week said it was not the right time to lift the restrictions. One British official told the BBC on Monday that the decision had come completely out of the blue. Following the announcement, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was ""delighted"". ""It's a fantastic boost for business and trade, and great that family and friends on both sides of the pond can be reunited once again,"" he wrote on Twitter. German Vice-Chancellor Olaf Scholz also welcomed the change, saying it was ""great news for German and European investments, our exports and transatlantic relations"". For months a joint working party has been looking at ways to relax the travel ban. The work, I'm told, has been detailed and assiduous. But last Friday in Washington next to no one (not even in the Biden administration) was expecting today's announcement. So what's changed? The Biden administration is aware of the growing disquiet among European allies about a range of issues - Afghanistan notably, but in recent days French fury over the Aukus submarine deal. And remember France is America's oldest ally. This week Joe Biden will be meeting not only Boris Johnson, but a whole pile of EU leaders during the UN General Assembly in New York. And all had it on their dance cards to raise the travel ban. According to one diplomatic source, the US over the weekend just weighed the countervailing forces: annoy some Americans with a policy that could be characterised as being weak on Covid; or continue to alienate your European allies who are growing increasingly irritable. With the data no longer supporting the ban, this weekend came a decision. Out of the blue in one way, but quite logical in another. Airline shares rose in response to the new travel rules, with British Airways owner IAG up as much as 10%. Virgin Atlantic chief executive Shai Weiss called the move ""a major milestone"" for travel recovery. Doug Parker, chairman and CEO of American Airlines, said he welcomed the ""science-based approach"" to lifting travel restrictions. ""With the shared goals of health and safety always at the forefront, we're looking forward to welcoming more customers back to easy, seamless international trips for business, for leisure, and to reconnect with family and friends,"" he said. Travellers also celebrated the changes. Phil White, a British entrepreneur who lives in the US, said the decision would allow him to see his 23-year-old daughter who lives in London for the first time since the pandemic started. ""We haven't been able to see our daughter over this time. And that has been very, very, very difficult for us,"" he told AFP news agency. He said he immediately booked a flight for her daughter after the news about the change was confirmed.  ""[A]s a family we're going to be together for Thanksgiving, which is amazing,"" he added. The US has recorded more than 42 million coronavirus cases since the pandemic began, and over 670,000 deaths. In an interview with BBC World News on Monday, White House coronavirus adviser Dr Anthony Fauci urged more Americans to get vaccinated.

"This video can not be played Kwasi Kwarteng: Talk of the lights going out is âalarmist, unhelpful and completely misguided"" There is ""no question of the lights going out"" this winter as a result of huge rises in gas prices, the business secretary has said. Kwasi Kwarteng said he does ""not expect supply emergencies"" and described warnings about shortages as ""alarmist"". His statement comes as smaller energy providers battle to stay afloat due to gas price hikes making price promises to customers undeliverable. High demand for gas and reduced supply are behind a surge in wholesale prices. Customers are protected from sudden hikes in wholesale gas prices through the energy price cap, which is the maximum price they can be charged on a standard tariff. However, the cap means energy firms are unable to pass on higher wholesale costs to their customers, which is forcing some - mostly smaller companies - to go out of business. So far, four energy firms have gone to the wall, and four more are expected to follow in the coming days. On Sunday, the UK's sixth largest energy company,Bulb, announced it is seeking a bailout. The government has said it is considering offering emergency state-backed loans to surviving energy companies to encourage them to take on customers from bust firms. Mr Kwarteng said the government would ""not be bailing out failed companies"" and said the sector had seen a ""regular entry and exit"" over the past five to 10 years. ""The current global situation may see more suppliers than usual exiting the market but this is not something that should be any cause for alarm or panic,"" he said. ""The taxpayer should not be expected to prop up companies which have poor business models and are not resilient to fluctuations in price."" Gas prices: 'I'm just watching the meter go up' How could the CO2 shortage hit food supplies? 'UK not seeing risks to supplies right now' Are energy bills going up and what can I do? The business secretary said the government wanted to protect customers from ""price spikes"" and that the energy industry should not  return to the ""cosy oligopoly"" of years past where a few large suppliers ""dictated to customers conditions and pricing"". At the beginning of 2021 there were 70 energy suppliers in the UK, but industry sources have said there may be as few as 10 left by the end of the year. Mr Kwarteng added the UK benefited from having a ""diverse range of gas supply sources"" and had ""more than sufficient capacity, to meet demand"". Shadow business secretary Ed Miliband warned that UK families were going to be hit by a ""triple whammy"" of tax rises, fuel costs and the end of the Universal Credit uplift this winter. Industry group Oil & Gas UK has said wholesale prices for gas had increased by 250% since January - with a 70% rise since August. The increase has been blamed on several factors, including a cold winter which left stocks lower than usual, high demand for liquefied natural gas from Asia, and lower supplies from other countries. Low winds meaning less renewable energy is being generated and outages at some nuclear stations have also contributed. It has left some companies unable to provide their customers with the energy they have paid for. However, if a supplier fails, energy regulator Ofgem will ensure supplies continue for affected households, and they will not lose money owed to them. A new energy supplier would be responsible for taking on any credit balances a customer may have, but consumers may end up on more expensive tariffs when they are switched. Aside from gas prices driving up energy bills, millions of households in England, Wales and Scotland are already facing a 12% rise in their energy bills from October when a higher price cap comes into force. Some of the largest energy companies have argued the current price cap on tariff - supported by both Labour and Conservative politicians - has helped trigger the current crisis. ""You can legislate to protect the consumer - but that can bankrupt the supplier,"" said one senior industry source. However, Mr Kwarteng said the energy price cap was ""not going anywhere"". Ofgem will review the price cap in February. There has been speculation that the energy regulator could lift the cap between now and next year to allow firms to charge customers more to cope with rising wholesale gas prices. Stacey Stothard is waiting to see how much more she will have to pay Stacey Stothard followed all the advice. Aware that energy prices were rising, she shopped around to find a decent fixed deal for her gas and electricity. She saved Â£300 - or so she thought.

""It is just like watching the meter go up and up,"" she says. ""I did the right thing - not going for the cheapest deal, but choosing a company with a decent customer service record."" Read more about her story here. Earlier on Tuesday, several smaller energy firms wrote an open letter sent to the prime minister, chancellor, business secretary and Ofgem, which stated they felt there ""voice, as suppliers of all different sizes, has not been heard"". Signed by the likes of Green, AMPower, Neon Reef and Tru Energy, it called for a support package for all suppliers, a review of the price cap and for smaller firms to be included in future discussions on the future of the energy market. It was critical of Ofgem, saying it was ""currently unfit to regulate an industry they have appeared to have a vested interest in or turning a blind eye to the market returning to a selective monopoly and a reduction in competition"". In a joint statement on gas prices, Mr Kwarteng and Ofgem chief executive Jonathan Brearley reiterated that the current crisis was ""not an issue of supply"". The pair said there was a consensus among energy suppliers and consumer groups that the ""top priority"" must be support for customers, ""especially the elderly and vulnerable"". ""In the event an energy supplier fails, we are committed that consumers face the least amount of disruption possible - and there are clear and well-established processes in place to ensuring this is the case,"" they added. As a result of gas prices booming, energy intensive fertiliser producers have shut down, which has created a shortage of the by-product of production, carbon dioxide. Food manufacturers and supermarkets have urged action because carbon dioxide is used to stun animals prior to slaughter and to keep food fresh for storage and transport. Supermarket Iceland's managing director Richard Walker told the BBC the carbon dioxide shortage must be prioritised to limit any potential disruption for supermarket supplies, which are also being affected due to a shortage in HGV drivers in the UK, partly caused by the pandemic and Brexit. Supermarket Ocado said it had ""limited stock"" of some frozen items due to gas shortages, while another supermarket told the BBC the situation was ""escalating quickly"". Customers will still continue to receive gas or electricity even if the energy supplier goes bust. Ofgem will move your account to a new supplier but it may take a few weeks.

"This video can not be played ""As soon as you see the two lines, you think of the baby that's going to come in nine months."" The first time that Sally Thompson became pregnant, she says the circumstances were not ideal. She had not been with her partner, Paul, for long and they were both living at home with their parents. Despite that, when the pregnancy ended in miscarriage at nine weeks, she felt a sense of sadness. ""It doesn't take long to get attached,"" she says. ""As soon as you kind of see the two lines or 'pregnant' on the test, you don't think of a ball of cells, you think of the baby that's going to come in nine months. ""That's what you think about and it is sad when it happens."" She says it was a confusing time, adding: ""It was lonely, because I didn't know anyone who had been through it. It was isolating because I didn't really know who to go to, to talk about it."" Sally is now 32 - she and Paul got married in 2017. She has been pregnant nine more times, but none of the pregnancies have gone to term. After each miscarriage, Sally took sick leave, as women who lose a baby before 24 weeks are entitled to do. Sally and Paul on their wedding day in 2017 While some of her employers were sympathetic, one was not and dismissed her following a lengthier absence. ""I have had kind of polar opposite experiences,"" she says. ""At that employer, miscarriage was not understood at all. It felt like they didn't care that I was coming to work and crying for 20 minutes before I even entered the building. ""My current employer is the complete opposite. I've had a miscarriage there and they could not have been kinder."" SNP MP Angela Crawley is calling on the government to give women and their partners the legal right to take three days paid leave, if a pregnancy ends before 24 weeks. This video can not be played SNP MP Angela Crawley says miscarriage should recognised as ""a loss, not an illness"". Sheintroduced a private members' bill,externalto Parliament in June, and it is due to have its first full debate in December. She says: ""I've received tonnes and tonnes of correspondence on this issue from fathers, from mothers and from families who have experienced miscarriage. ""They have outlined that, in most cases, there was a degree of stigma or shame to experiencing a miscarriage."" Many mothers took unpaid leave or sick leave, she adds, and many fathers took unpaid time off because ""they didn't feel they could approach their employer and ask for paid leave"". The government introduced paid parental leave for the loss of a baby after 24 weeks in April 2020. It entitles a parent to two weeks' leave paid at Â£151.97 a week, or 90% of their average weekly earnings, whichever is lower. A government spokesperson told the BBC the entitlement to this pay ""is a floor not a ceiling, and we urge employers to show compassion and flexibility towards women who have suffered a miscarriage, and to respond sensitively to each individual's specific needs"". NZ approves paid leave after miscarriages 'I faced miscarriage alone - my partner had to wait in the car park' What to say to someone who's lost a baby Speaking in the Commons in July this year, Boris Johnson appeared to suggest he would not be in favour of extending parental leave to those who suffered the loss of a baby earlier in the pregnancy. He said it entitled those who lost a child after 24 weeks of pregnancy to some payment. He added: ""But of course, nothing I can say and no payment we could make would be any consolation to those who experience a miscarriage in that way."" Mr Johnson's wife, Carrie, announced on social media in August that the couple had experienced a miscarriage earlier in 2021. Boris Johnson and his wife Carrie suffered a miscarriage in 2021 A policy of statutory paid leave would come at a cost. Some employers have already decided to introduce paid leave themselves. The retailer John Lewis will offer two weeks' paid leave from November to staff who experience a miscarriage at any stage of pregnancy. Nikki Humphrey, the company's executive director for people, says the business has weighed the cost and benefits. ""We know anyway that when someone experiences a loss of pregnancy they typically take time off for sick leave and so actually the bigger factor was about how do we provide the right support,"" she says. ""We clearly had to consider the financial aspect but importantly it was their whole wellbeing we considered."" Sally says she believes paid leave would have helped. ""For my early losses that may have been all the time that I would need. ""I think a lot of people, men included, would find that useful because it would give men time to be there with their partners who are going through a difficult experience."" Rhiannan lost triplets just 12 weeks in to her pregnancy Rhiannan, from Cheshire, has two sons, aged three and five. She spoke to BBC 5 Live Breakfast's Nicky Campbell about her experience of many years of infertility, IVF and miscarriages. ""One of our miscarriages was triplets through IVF,"" she told him. ""They all reached a point just before 12 weeks and their hearts stopped."" Rhiannan said there needs to be ""a lot more sensitivity"" around the issue. ""It can affect everybody in very different ways, both mentally and physically,"" she added. ""It took my body the full nine months to get over the triplet loss. ""It can also sometimes make you a bit numb - you do physically shut yourself off from a lot of feelings to cope with it"". Rhiannan said she would welcome Angela Crawley's proposed changes. ""Three days isn't necessarily enough but it's a good start and it definitely opens up the doors to it being more normal,"" she said. Nick and his wife lost a baby in December Nick, in Guildford, told BBC Radio 5 Live his wife had a miscarriage on a Saturday in December, at the start of the second lockdown. He then returned to work the following Monday. ""I went back to work a couple of days afterwards, but there was no way my wife could have,"" he said. ""You have to be there because they're the person going through it. You've got to get them out the other side, but you lose your baby at the same time. ""You have to somehow pull yourself together at the same time as you hold the person up as best you can."" Nick's manager was supportive and the company has subsequently brought in one-week of paid leave for early miscarriage. ""I had a good relationship with my manager at the time [so] I was able to tell her and she was able to help support me in that time,"" he said.

"This video can not be played ""As soon as you see the two lines, you think of the baby that's going to come in nine months."" The first time that Sally Thompson became pregnant, she says the circumstances were not ideal. She had not been with her partner, Paul, for long and they were both living at home with their parents. Despite that, when the pregnancy ended in miscarriage at nine weeks, she felt a sense of sadness. ""It doesn't take long to get attached,"" she says. ""As soon as you kind of see the two lines or 'pregnant' on the test, you don't think of a ball of cells, you think of the baby that's going to come in nine months. ""That's what you think about and it is sad when it happens."" She says it was a confusing time, adding: ""It was lonely, because I didn't know anyone who had been through it. It was isolating because I didn't really know who to go to, to talk about it."" Sally is now 32 - she and Paul got married in 2017. She has been pregnant nine more times, but none of the pregnancies have gone to term. After each miscarriage, Sally took sick leave, as women who lose a baby before 24 weeks are entitled to do. Sally and Paul on their wedding day in 2017 While some of her employers were sympathetic, one was not and dismissed her following a lengthier absence. ""I have had kind of polar opposite experiences,"" she says. ""At that employer, miscarriage was not understood at all. It felt like they didn't care that I was coming to work and crying for 20 minutes before I even entered the building. ""My current employer is the complete opposite. I've had a miscarriage there and they could not have been kinder."" SNP MP Angela Crawley is calling on the government to give women and their partners the legal right to take three days paid leave, if a pregnancy ends before 24 weeks. This video can not be played SNP MP Angela Crawley says miscarriage should recognised as ""a loss, not an illness"". Sheintroduced a private members' bill,externalto Parliament in June, and it is due to have its first full debate in December. She says: ""I've received tonnes and tonnes of correspondence on this issue from fathers, from mothers and from families who have experienced miscarriage. ""They have outlined that, in most cases, there was a degree of stigma or shame to experiencing a miscarriage."" Many mothers took unpaid leave or sick leave, she adds, and many fathers took unpaid time off because ""they didn't feel they could approach their employer and ask for paid leave"". The government introduced paid parental leave for the loss of a baby after 24 weeks in April 2020. It entitles a parent to two weeks' leave paid at Â£151.97 a week, or 90% of their average weekly earnings, whichever is lower. A government spokesperson told the BBC the entitlement to this pay ""is a floor not a ceiling, and we urge employers to show compassion and flexibility towards women who have suffered a miscarriage, and to respond sensitively to each individual's specific needs"". NZ approves paid leave after miscarriages 'I faced miscarriage alone - my partner had to wait in the car park' What to say to someone who's lost a baby Speaking in the Commons in July this year, Boris Johnson appeared to suggest he would not be in favour of extending parental leave to those who suffered the loss of a baby earlier in the pregnancy. He said it entitled those who lost a child after 24 weeks of pregnancy to some payment. He added: ""But of course, nothing I can say and no payment we could make would be any consolation to those who experience a miscarriage in that way."" Mr Johnson's wife, Carrie, announced on social media in August that the couple had experienced a miscarriage earlier in 2021. Boris Johnson and his wife Carrie suffered a miscarriage in 2021 A policy of statutory paid leave would come at a cost. Some employers have already decided to introduce paid leave themselves. The retailer John Lewis will offer two weeks' paid leave from November to staff who experience a miscarriage at any stage of pregnancy. Nikki Humphrey, the company's executive director for people, says the business has weighed the cost and benefits. ""We know anyway that when someone experiences a loss of pregnancy they typically take time off for sick leave and so actually the bigger factor was about how do we provide the right support,"" she says. ""We clearly had to consider the financial aspect but importantly it was their whole wellbeing we considered."" Sally says she believes paid leave would have helped. ""For my early losses that may have been all the time that I would need. ""I think a lot of people, men included, would find that useful because it would give men time to be there with their partners who are going through a difficult experience.""

"""When it goes wrong, it really does go wrong - one wrong move, one throwaway comment and months of planning and international diplomacy are in the bin."" No stress then! As one former Downing Street senior staff member recalls, visits to the White House are about as high pressure as it gets. British prime ministers always lavish praise on the importance of the relationship with the US. So when it's time for an invite to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue the pressure is really on. In the run up to the big event, warm words are the order of the day. Today is no exception. Boris Johnson told the travelling press pack that the relationship between the two countries is as ""good as it has been for decades"", claiming his relationship with President Biden is ""genuinely terrific"", and joking the two have bonded over their love of rail - ""he's a train nut"". There's bonhomie, and - having witnessed the two at the G7 in Cornwall - it is visible. The UK camp is encouraged atthe American removal of travel restrictions on UK citizens in November. And there's a sense that the president might be ready to make extra commitments on climate finance which would thrill Downing Street. But nothing is that straightforward. Increase climate commitments, PM to urge Biden They'll have to confront tensions over the handling of the withdrawal of forces in Afghanistan. And the UK doesn't expect much progress on trade either, saying American negotiators are ""ruthless"", playing down expectations of things moving forward. But first and foremost both sides will want Tuesday's big meeting to go smoothly. No gaffes, no misunderstandings, no embarrassments. Whatever the personal friendships or frictions between the two main protagonists, it matters because, as one No 10 insider told me, ""the relationship matters for the mutual benefit of our people"". The current Downing Street team don't seem to be nervous about the meeting on Tuesday, at least outwardly, but they are conscious of how much it matters, and how previously things have gone awry. Who could forget the last time a British prime minister held talks in the Oval Office? The press conference back in 2017 was quite the experience. This video can not be played President Trump joked about the special relationship with the UK What you might not know was that Theresa May's team was worried about the menu - because the ribs on offer at the getting-to-know-you lunch might plaster barbecue sauce all over the then prime minster's face during the huge TV moment. They discovered the meat was ""neatly chopped"" after all. Or that former President Trump anti-bacced his hands after shaking hands with Theresa May's team - one of them now jokes ""he was ahead of his time"". Or indeed, that ""May bossed her foreign secretary around on the plane on the way, talking down to him in front of others, and yet he is the man now in charge"". Ouch! For David Cameron's team there were similar stresses, and frankly high farce. After ""endless discussions about photo ops"", one member of his team remembers, the two men took Air Force One to a college basketball game, putting David Cameron under unfamiliar pressure when he had to give a half-time interview about the match on a ""subject he knew nothing about"". This video can not be played President Barack Obama has given British Prime Minister David Cameron a front row seat at the US college basketball championships Money couldn't buy these kind of images for a British prime minister - putting them on the spot over alley-oops or a 5-out motion, less desirable altogether. And that's before you factor in the British reaction back then to the mere name of the White House protocol supremo, Randy Bumgardner, to the bemusement of the Americans. Two nations divided perhaps not just by a common language, but by different senses of humour too. So, there is a lot at stake - the risk of misunderstanding, disagreement on policy, a clash of political personality, or just blunders that cause blushes. As one of those who felt it go wrong to their cost told me, ""it's important to be on best behaviour"". Mr Johnson has been to the White House before, as foreign secretary in 2019. But so much has changed then, on this side of the Atlantic and at home. A very different prime minister. A very different president. A very different set of challenges for the world. And British prime ministers' visits to the White House are, as occasions in themselves, about as momentous as it gets.
