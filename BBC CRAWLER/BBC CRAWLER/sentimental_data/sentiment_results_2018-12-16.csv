"This video can not be played Liam Fox: 'How do we tell the SNP that they can't have another referendum on independence?' Parliament might have to decide what to do next if Theresa May's Brexit deal is rejected by MPs, cabinet minister Liam Fox has said. The senior Brexiteer said the PM's deal was unlikely to pass through Parliament unless the backstop issue was resolved. He said one option could be a ""free vote"" for MPs. An alternative being widely suggested is another referendum - but Mr Fox told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show this was unlikely and would not ""heal division"". Other options backed by different groups of MPs include leaving without a deal, another referendum, or Norway or Canada-style alternative deals.Norway has a very close relationshipwith the EU but is not a member, whileCanada has an extensive trade dealwith the bloc. New Brexit poll 'logical outcome' says Blair Reality check: Another EU referendum Education Secretary Damian Hinds has also suggested ""flushing out"" the levels of Parliamentary support for different Brexit options although he told BBC Radio5Live's Pienaar's Politics there was not a majority for any of them. And Lib Dem MP Tom Brake, who is part of the anti-Brexit ""Best for Britain"" campaign, said: ""When even Dr Fox does not rule out free votes and encourages the idea of indicative votes in Parliament, the Brexit project is clearly in jeopardy."" By BBC political correspondent Chris Mason What we are witnessing is a bursting out in public of conversations that have been happening for a while, at a senior level, in private. They can be summarised like this: 'What on earth do we do next?' One idea, now floated by three cabinet ministers in public, and others privately, is a series of so called ""indicative votes"". These would flush out Parliament's view on a range of options which could include different models of Brexit: something akin to Norway's relationship with the EU for instance, or Canada's looser one. Another referendum and no deal are other possibilities. Some ponder doing this before the vote on the prime minister's deal, in the hope it highlights that her plan is the only workable Brexit deal achievable now. ""Things are not as hopeless as they look,"" one cabinet minister told me. But when I wished them a merry Christmas and a happy new year, that word 'happy' was met with a wry smile. None of this is remotely straight forward. On the possibility of another referendum, International Trade Secretary Mr Fox said one could result in a narrow Remain win on a lower turnout, in which case, ""People like me will be immediately demanding that it's best of three - where does that end up?"" It comes after Theresa Mayaccused former Labour PM Tony Blair of undermining Brexit negotiations by calling for another referendumamid continuing calls for one to be held to solve the impasse over the UK's exit from the European Union. Two of Mrs May's key allies - chief of staff, Gavin Barwell, and her effective second-in-command David Lidington - distanced themselves from reports they were involved in planning for a new referendum. On Thursday about 10 Labour MPs met Mr Lidington to argue for another public vote. Mr Lidingtontweeted,externalthat he had told the Commons last week that another referendum would be ""divisive"" and would not guarantee a ""decisive"" ending to the debate. Mr Barwell alsoused Twitter to say,externalhe did not want another referendum and was not planning one. Mrs May met EU leaders on Thursday - after postponing a Commons vote on the withdrawal deal she has negotiated, fearing its heavy defeat. The government says the Commons vote will go ahead in January, as talks continue with the EU on the issue of the Irish border ""backstop"". This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. The backstop is an insurance policy in the withdrawal deal to prevent the return of a hard border with Northern Ireland if no trade deal is reached - but many of Mrs May's MPs say they cannot support it, arguing it would keep the UK tied to EU rules indefinitely and curb its ability to strike trade deals. EU leaders have said the deal is ""not open for renegotiation"" - but that there could be some further clarification. Mr Fox said talks would continue over Christmas and the new year. He said it was ""clear"" that the EU understood the problem, and it was now a question of finding a ""mechanism"" that would remove MPs' concerns, without which, he suggested it would not be worth putting it to a Commons vote ""knowing it would be rejected"". If the deal could not get through the Commons, he said: ""Parliament would have to decide on the alternatives."" This video can not be played Tony Blair tells Today the EU would help the UK remain if it was ""prepared to think again"" Meanwhile, Labour frontbencher Andrew Gwynne told the BBC his party would be trying to bring the MPs' ""meaningful vote"" on the deal forward to this week. The Labour leadership is under pressure from other opposition parties to call for a vote of no confidence in the government. But Mr Gwynne said: ""We can't move to the next stage until Parliament has decided whether or not to back the prime minister's deal."" Asked whether his party would campaign for Brexit under a Labour deal if there were to be another referendum, he said: ""Let's wait and see. These things are moving very quickly. ""We are a democratic party and we will put our decision to the party members in a democratic way before we decide what the next steps are."" Please upgrade your browser Labour's official position is to argue for a general election if Mrs May's deal cannot get through the Commons but to keep all options open if that doesn't happen - including another referendum. Anti-Brexit Labour backbencher Chuka Umunna told the BBC it was time to ""clear the decks"" and hold the MPs' vote on the deal before moving on to ""consider the other options"". He said there was no majority for another referendum in the Commons at the moment but said: ""I think the position of members of Parliament will change, according to what happens.""

"This video can not be played Theresa May announces Brexit vote date MPs will vote on the UK's Brexit deal in the week beginning 14 January, Theresa May has told Parliament. The vote was due to be held last week but was put on hold after Mrs May admitted she was set to lose. Announcing a new date, she said the EU had made it clear the Irish backstop was ""not a plot to trap the UK"", and urged MPs to see Brexit through. But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he would table a motion of no confidence in the PM for delaying the vote. He told the Commons it was unacceptable that MPs had to wait another month before having their say on Mrs May's deal. He added the PM had ""led the country into a national crisis"". Parliament Live: Rolling updates on Theresa May statement to MPs Corbyn: PM's led UK into national crisis Brexit: A really simple guide Reality Check: How could new referendum work? Kuenssberg: Don't forget there is actually a deal Mr Corbyn's motion - due to be tabled on Tuesday - calls on MPs to declare they have ""no confidence in the prime minister due to her failure to allow the House of Commons to have a meaningful vote straight away"" on the Brexit deal. It focuses on Mrs May personally, rather than the government. BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg said that while the motion - if successful - could not end in the collapse of the government, ""it would be another embarrassment for the PM if Labour ends up winning the day"". Earlier, Mr Corbyn said a month would be wasted since the original 11 December vote was postponed, with ""not a single word renegotiated and not a single reassurance given"". ""The deal is unchanged and is not going to change,"" he said. ""The House must get on with the vote and move on to consider the realistic alternatives."" This video can not be played PM on EU: ""There is no plot to keep us in backstop."" Mrs May's Brexit deal sets out the terms of Britain's exit from the EU - on 29 March 2019 - and includes a declaration on the outline of the future relations between the UK and the EU. But the deal only comes into force if both parliaments approve it. In a Commons statement, Mrs May said MPs would resume the debate - halted last week - in the week of 7 January. The ""meaningful"" vote is due to take place in the following week. Mrs May told MPs: ""It is now only just over 14 weeks until the UK leaves the EU and I know many members of this House are concerned that we need to take a decision soon."" She said she had won fresh guarantees at last week's EU summit over measures to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland and she hoped to secure additional ""political and legal assurances"" in the coming weeks. Earlier on Monday, an EU spokesman said it had provided the ""clarifications"" requested on the contentious issue of the Northern Ireland border backstop and ""no further meetings were foreseen"". During her statement, Mrs May faced calls from across the House for the vote to be held immediately. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: May taking shambolic government to new level The SNP's Ian Blackford said the government was a ""laughing stock"" and Parliament needed to ""take control of the situation and find a solution"". Former education secretary Justine Greening said Mrs May had led the UK down a ""political cul-de-sac"" and suggested that criticising alternatives to her deal was ""pointless"", given the level of opposition to it among MPs. ""She now isn't just not listening, she is not allowing debate,"" she said. Watt: Could John Bercow end the Brexit gridlock? Cameron 'advising PM on Brexit options' Former cabinet ministers Dominic Raab and Esther McVey urged the PM to accelerate planning for a no-deal exit while another former minister, Andrew Mitchell, urged her to consider suspending the Brexit process to allow for further negotiations. Please upgrade your browser But Mrs May won support from one ""previously sceptical"" Brexiteer, Sir Edward Leigh, who said her efforts to secure a legally-binding protocol on the Irish backstop might pay off, urging her to ""keep calm and carry on"". Earlier, No 10 said it had ""no plans"" for votes on other Brexit outcomes if the PM's deal is rejected after it emerged David Cameron had given advice to his successor. The BBC understands Mr Cameron has been in touch with Mrs May about how a series of ""indicative votes"" on various different Brexit outcomes could be handled if there was deadlock over the terms of the UK's exit. Potential ""Plan B"" options include: pursuing differentNorwayorCanada-stylearrangements with the EU leaving on the basis of a""managed no deal"" delaying Brexit to restart negotiations holda fresh referendum The PM is coming under pressure from ministers to ""test the will of Parliament"" through a series of non-binding votes - which would see MPs pass judgement on the options available in the hope of identifying the most popular. Business Secretary Greg Clark said he backed Mrs May's deal but if Parliament was implacably opposed, it should be ""invited to say what it would agree with"". This video can not be played Could there be a second Brexit vote? ""Businesses expect MPs to take responsibility rather than just be critics,"" he told Radio 4's Today. Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd made the same point, saying ""all options"" should remain on the table and if the deal was rejected ""let's think about how we test the will of Parliament to find out where the majority is"" Calls for another referendum have grown in recent weeks amid signs a majority of MPs are opposed both to the deal on the table but also leaving the EU without any kind of agreement. Green Party MP Caroline Lucas said a new referendum would be the ""first opportunity for people to vote on the facts, not on the fantasy and the fabrication"". But Mrs May said another vote would do ""irreparable damage to the integrity of our politics"" and not settle the issue. ""Let us not break faith with the British people by trying to stage another referendum,"" she said. ""Another vote which would likely leave us no further forward than the last. And another vote which would further divide our country at the very moment we should be working to unite it."" New Brexit poll logical outcome - Blair There were reports in the Sunday newspapers that two of Mrs May's key allies were planning for another referendum, in the event that her deal cannot get MPs' backing. Both men - Downing Street chief of staff Gavin Barwell and Mrs May's de facto deputy David Lidington - distanced themselves from the reports. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Separately, more than 60 MPs from various parties have written to the PM urging her to rule out a no-deal Brexit, saying it would do ""unnecessary economic damage"" to manufacturers in their constituencies. Speaking in the Commons, ex-minister Jonathan Djanogly said the UK was ""haemorrhaging support and investment"" while Oliver Heald said the EU's ""patronising"" attitude to the UK betrayed a lack of urgency to prevent the disruption of a disorderly Brexit.

"Theresa May has attacked one of her predecessors - accusing Tony Blair of ""undermining"" the Brexit talks by calling for another referendum. She called his comments an ""insult to the office he once held"" and said MPs could not ""abdicate responsibility"" to deliver Brexit by holding a new poll. In London last week, Mr Blair said MPs might back a new vote if ""none of the other options work"". In response to Mrs May, he insisted that a new referendum was democratic. ""Far from being anti-democratic it would be the opposite, as indeed many senior figures in her party from past and present have been saying,"" he said. On Thursday about 10 Labour MPs met David Lidington - who is Mrs May's de facto second-in-command - to argue for another public vote. Sources close to Mr Lidington said it was ""pretty standard stuff"" and he was not ""planning for or advocating a second referendum"". Many senior Labour figures are deeply uneasy about endorsing another referendum. Reality Check: How could another Brexit referendum work? Kuenssberg: An issue of trust New Brexit poll logical outcome - Blair Analysis: Labour's referendum strains The government is also opposed to any further referendum, saying the public made a clear choice when they voted in 2016 to leave by a margin of 51.9% to 48.1%. BBC political correspondent Chris Mason said Mrs May's criticism of the former Labour prime minister was striking for its anger. Mrs May said: ""For Tony Blair to go to Brussels and seek to undermine our negotiations by advocating for a second referendum is an insult to the office he once held and the people he once served. She added: ""We cannot, as he would, abdicate responsibility for this decision. ""Parliament has a democratic duty to deliver what the British people voted for."" Meanwhile, the PM's chief of staff, Gavin Barwell, has responded to reports in the Mail on Sunday that he told colleagues another referendum was ""the only way out of this"", sayingon Twitter,external: ""Happy to confirm I am not planning a 2nd referendum with political opponents (or anyone else, to anticipate the next question).""

Many of Mrs May's Conservative MPs are concerned that the ""backstop"" - which is aimed at preventing a hard border in Northern Ireland - would keep the UK tied to EU rules and limit its ability to strike trade deals. Education Secretary Damian Hinds has told the BBC a second referendum would not end the deadlock over Brexit but might simply extend the impasse. Speaking on BBC Breakfast, he urged politicians to back the PM's plan, describing it as ""balanced"" and the ""best of both worlds"".

"One possible way to break the political stalemate over Brexit, could be to offer the public a new vote on European Union (EU) membership. Labour's leader, Jeremy Corbyn, haschallenged the next prime minister - either Jeremy Hunt or Boris Johnson - to hold another referendum, saying Labour will campaign for ""Remain"". With the UK due to leave the EU on 31 October, how could another referendum work? Organising another public vote would take a minimum of 22 weeks, according to experts at the Constitution Unit at University College London (UCL). This would consist of at least 12 weeks to pass the legislation required to hold a referendum, plus a further 10 weeks to organise the campaign and hold the vote itself. No-deal Brexit: What you need to know The border blocking Brexit Can the next PM force through a no-deal Brexit? A government cannot just decide to hold a referendum. Instead, a majority of MPs and Lords would need to agree and vote through the rules of another public vote. Parliament could copy over large chunks of the legislation that led to the 2016 referendum to speed things up: ""This could be done very quickly in theory,"" says Alan Renwick, deputy director at the Constitution Unit. Mr Renwick estimates this approach could take about 11 weeks - much shorter then the seven months it took last time. But that assumes things go smoothly. If there was a lot of disagreement amongst MPs, it could take much longer to pass the legislation. Potential flashpoints could be over the wording of the referendum question, the number of options on the ballot paper and the voting system. If the legislation was successfully passed, official campaign groups would have to be selected. This would be done by the Electoral Commission. It also needs to assess the referendum question, provide information to voters about how to take part and ensure enough counting officers are available around the country. Once that's out the way, there's the campaign - which usually lasts four weeks - and then the vote itself. All of this would take a minimum of 10 weeks - from passing the legislation to holding the vote,as set out in the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000,external. The Electoral Commission says existing law stipulates this is a rigid period that cannot be shortened. Justine Greening, a former Conservative minister, favours another referendum On a 22-week timetable (allowing for legislation and a campaign), it would take until at least mid-December to hold another vote - and that's if the process started now. That means, if Parliament was determined to hold another public vote, it would need to ask the EU to extend the 31 October Brexit deadline. If the EU agreed, it would be the third Brexit extension. But it's not unheard of for countries to hold referendums on much tighter timescales. Four years ago,Greece organised a referendum in just over a week, in which voters rejected the terms of an international bailout following the country's debt crisis. However, Alan Renwick says that if referendums are organised too hastily, it can give the impression that ""normal procedure is not being followed"" and that voters may see the eventual result as illegitimate. A referendum similar to Greece's timescale, for example, would not allow enough time to organise postal votes and assess the question on the ballot paper.

"This text and image form part of a longer document sent to the printers Hackers have taken control of printers around the world. It is the latest in a series of such attacks, but this time they say they have the power to destroy the machines. The stunt was first carried out last month, when one member claimed to have forced about 50,000 printers to create posters supporting his favourite vlogger PewDiePie. The latest incident again urges support for the YouTuber, but also calls on victims to improve their security. ""I've been trying to show that 'hacking' isn't a game or toy, it can have serious real-life consequences,"" the original hacker told the BBC, speaking anonymously online. ""We really want people to pay attention to this because causing physical damage is very much a possibility."" He explained that flaws in the printers' firmware meant that he could continuously force data to be written to their chips. ""These chips have a limited lifetime of 'writes',"" he explained. ""If you keep the loop on enough, the chip will fry and the printer will no longer function."" The potential financial costs to this are obvious but the hacker also pointed to another danger that his stunt has thrown up. ""The fallout goes beyond print-outs, we could also be capturing sensitive documents as they get printed or even modify documents as they get printed."" Although the hacker can geo-locate the countries that he is affecting, it's not clear whether or not a targeted attack on an individual company or household is possible. Allow Twitter content?

The hackers claim to have printed out their latest message on more than 100,000 machines. The BBC has not been able to verify the claim, but people from countries including the UK, US, Argentina, Spain, Australia and Chile have posted pictures on social media of the latest print-outs. More people are expected to notice their printers have created copies of the poster when they return to work on Monday. It reads: ""PewDiePie is in trouble and he needs your help to defeat T-Series!"" The message then instructs readers to subscribe to the YouTuber before adding: ""Seriously. Fix your printer. It can be abused!"" PewDiePie has been YouTube's most subscribed to creator since 2013. He currently has about 77 million followers on the platform. Over recent months, the Indian music label and movie studio T-Series has come close to overtaking his lead, which has led some PewDiePie fans to mount stunts to attract new subscribers. Felix Kjellberg - who is known as PewDiePie - is currently YouTube's most subscribed-to creator Security vendors say that the stunt shows just how vulnerable some organisations can be to attack through the plethora of connected devices that fill modern office spaces. Their advice is to: carry out regular audits of connected devices install the latest security patches question whether or not everything connected to the internet really needs to be ""The risk of causing financial damage in this case is as real as it gets,"" commented Bob Reny from the security firm ForeScout. ""And all of this because organisations or individuals installed a connected device without really taking the time to audit the implications this has on their existing network security infrastructure."" The hackers provided contact details on the latest print-outs as a way to allow people to get in touch if they needed further help fix the exploited flaw. One told the BBC that they believed they were breaking the law, but still thought their act was justified. ""While authorities might not see eye to eye with us, what we're doing is much better than someone destroying printers and offices around the world in an attempt to hold printers ransom or something."" Vulnerabilities in network printers have been known about for years but many people are unaware of the risks. One security researcher who has studied the problem confirmed it was possible to destroy the machines by sending them commands from afar.

"This text and image form part of a longer document sent to the printers Hackers have taken control of printers around the world. It is the latest in a series of such attacks, but this time they say they have the power to destroy the machines. The stunt was first carried out last month, when one member claimed to have forced about 50,000 printers to create posters supporting his favourite vlogger PewDiePie. The latest incident again urges support for the YouTuber, but also calls on victims to improve their security. ""I've been trying to show that 'hacking' isn't a game or toy, it can have serious real-life consequences,"" the original hacker told the BBC, speaking anonymously online. ""We really want people to pay attention to this because causing physical damage is very much a possibility."" He explained that flaws in the printers' firmware meant that he could continuously force data to be written to their chips. ""These chips have a limited lifetime of 'writes',"" he explained. ""If you keep the loop on enough, the chip will fry and the printer will no longer function."" The potential financial costs to this are obvious but the hacker also pointed to another danger that his stunt has thrown up. ""The fallout goes beyond print-outs, we could also be capturing sensitive documents as they get printed or even modify documents as they get printed."" Although the hacker can geo-locate the countries that he is affecting, it's not clear whether or not a targeted attack on an individual company or household is possible. Allow Twitter content?

The hackers claim to have printed out their latest message on more than 100,000 machines. The BBC has not been able to verify the claim, but people from countries including the UK, US, Argentina, Spain, Australia and Chile have posted pictures on social media of the latest print-outs. More people are expected to notice their printers have created copies of the poster when they return to work on Monday. It reads: ""PewDiePie is in trouble and he needs your help to defeat T-Series!"" The message then instructs readers to subscribe to the YouTuber before adding: ""Seriously. Fix your printer. It can be abused!"" PewDiePie has been YouTube's most subscribed to creator since 2013. He currently has about 77 million followers on the platform. Over recent months, the Indian music label and movie studio T-Series has come close to overtaking his lead, which has led some PewDiePie fans to mount stunts to attract new subscribers. Felix Kjellberg - who is known as PewDiePie - is currently YouTube's most subscribed-to creator Security vendors say that the stunt shows just how vulnerable some organisations can be to attack through the plethora of connected devices that fill modern office spaces. Their advice is to: carry out regular audits of connected devices install the latest security patches question whether or not everything connected to the internet really needs to be ""The risk of causing financial damage in this case is as real as it gets,"" commented Bob Reny from the security firm ForeScout. ""And all of this because organisations or individuals installed a connected device without really taking the time to audit the implications this has on their existing network security infrastructure."" The hackers provided contact details on the latest print-outs as a way to allow people to get in touch if they needed further help fix the exploited flaw. One told the BBC that they believed they were breaking the law, but still thought their act was justified. ""While authorities might not see eye to eye with us, what we're doing is much better than someone destroying printers and offices around the world in an attempt to hold printers ransom or something."" Vulnerabilities in network printers have been known about for years but many people are unaware of the risks. One security researcher who has studied the problem confirmed it was possible to destroy the machines by sending them commands from afar. ""These devices should never be directly reachable over the internet,"" said Jens Mueller from Ruhr-University in Germany. ""Who is to blame? [In offices] definitely the network administrators allowing direct access to their devices over the internet.""

"This video can not be played Why are Russian rappers getting arrested? Russian President Vladimir Putin has asked the government to ""take charge"" of rap music after a number of concerts were cancelled across the country. Efforts to ban rap were ""impossible"" and so the state should play a greater role in controlling it, he said. The Ministry of Culture would find the best way to ""navigate"" youth concerts, he added. His comments come afterRussian rapper Husky was arrestedafter several of his concerts were cancelled. In December, authorities in the southern city of Krasnodar called off his planned performance for ""extremism"". The musician - real name Dmitry Kuznetsov - was then jailed for 12 days after performing for fans on the roof of a car. A number of Russian rap concerts have been cancelled recently Speaking at a meeting of the presidential Council for Culture and Art in St Petersburg, President Putin said the problem should be approached ""with great caution"". ""However, what I really agree with is that if it is impossible to stop it, it should be taken over and navigated in a particular way,"" he said. The unexpected facts about music in Russia Who are the hypebeasts of Russia? The president expressed particular concern about drug abuse among young people. ""Rap and other modern [forms of art] are rested upon three pillars - sex, drugs and protest,"" he said. ""I am most worried about drugs. This is the way towards the degradation of a nation."" President Putin believes rap should be controlled, not banned Mr Putin also said he was worried about bad language in rap, saying he had spoken to a linguist about it. While she had explained to him that swearing is ""a part of our language"", Mr Putin compared it to the human body, joking that ""we have all sorts of body parts, and it's not like we put them on display all the time"". The Russian government has long had a complicated relationship with music. Feminist protest band Pussy Riot claimsRussia's intelligence service poisoned member Pyotr Verzilovearlier this year. The BBC DJ who 'brought down the USSR' Recording music onto X-rays to beat the censors Under the Soviet Union meanwhile, most Western pop and rock music was frowned on and some Russian rock musicians faced persecution.

"Hundreds gathered in Strasbourg to honour the victims on Sunday A fifth victim has died following the gun attack on the Christmas market in the French city of Strasbourg, the Paris prosecutor's office has said. His brother named him as Barto Pedro Orent-Niedzielski, a 36-year-old Polish-born man. The suspect in last Tuesday's attack, Cherif Chekatt, was shot dead by police on Thursday. Four members of his family were released on Saturday and two others close to him were freed on Sunday. Only one other person remains in detention. What we know so far On Sunday, hundreds of people gathered around a makeshift shrine in Strasbourg to honour the victims with readings and songs. Barto Pedro Orent-Niedzielskidied at about 18:00 local time on Sunday (17:00 GMT). He had spent five days in a coma and never recovered. His family had kept him on life support so that those close to him could come to say goodbye at the Hautepierre hospital in the city. Kamal Naghchbandwas a garage mechanic originally from Afghanistan. The father of three had been visiting the market with his family and was shot in the head. Anupong Suebsamarn, 45, was a Thai national on holiday with his wife. Antonio Megalizzi, a 29-year-old Italian journalist, was critically injured in the attack and his death was announced three days later. A retired bank worker aged 61, from Strasbourg, also died. About 10 people remain injured, several seriously. Who are the victims? As a result of two significant eyewitness reports, an extensive police operation involving a helicopter was launched in the Neudorf area - where the suspect was last seen - on Thursday evening. At about 21:00, the suspect was killed in an exchange of fire with police on rue du Lazaret, France's anti-terror prosecutor RÃ©my Heitz said. He was later identified through his fingerprints. The officers found an old gun, still loaded, some ammunition and a knife on his body. Seven people were initially arrested in connection with the attack. Cherif Chekatt's parents and two of his brothers were among those detained, but have since been freed. At about 20:00 local time (19:00 GMT) on 11 December, a man opened fire close to the famed Christmas market. Mr Heitz said the man had shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" (""God is greatest"") as he opened fire. The suspect was armed with a gun and a knife and escaped the area after jumping into a taxi. As he fled he came into contact with four soldiers, Mr Heitz said, and began firing at them. The soldiers fired back, apparently hitting him in the arm. The attacker told the taxi driver he had killed 10 people, and also said he had been injured during a firefight with soldiers. He ordered the taxi driver to drop him near the police station in Neudorf. When he got out of the vehicle, he fired at police officers before escaping. Chekatt was born in Strasbourg and was already known to the security services. He was on the ""fiche S"" watchlist of people who represent a potential threat to national security. He had 27 convictions for crimes including robbery spanning France, Germany and Switzerland, and had spent considerable time in prison as a result. Strasbourg shooting: Face to face with gunman The Islamic State group's self-styled news agency, Amaq, on Thursday said that Chekatt was ""an Islamic State soldier"" who had ""carried out the operation in response to calls for targeting citizens of coalition countries"" fighting its militants in Syria and Iraq.

"This video can not be played Members of the public filmed the fire as it took hold Chester Zoo says it is ""devastated"" by the loss of some of its animals in a fire. The blaze broke out in the Monsoon Forest area on Saturday, destroying much of its roof. Orangutans, macaques, gibbons and larger birds were saved, but some frogs, fish, insects and small birds died. Cheshire Fire said the blaze was ""accidental"" but it needed more time to determine the exact cause. An online appeal launched by the zoo, which reopened on Sunday, has raised more than Â£100,000 in 24 hours - double its target. The fire broke out on Saturday morning The tourism attraction, which has more than 21,000 animals, said all the creatures led to safety were being relocated within the 125-acre site and described the loss of others as ""heartbreaking"". Jamie Christon, the zoo's chief operating officer,said in a statement,external: ""Yesterday was one of the toughest days in Chester Zoo's long history. ""Keepers were able to encourage all mammal species away from the fire and to safety - including the zoo's group of critically endangered Sumatran orangutans, Sulawesi macaques, endangered silvery gibbons and birds such as rhinoceros hornbills. ""We are though, devastated to say that we were unable to save some of our insects, frogs, fish and small birds who were located near to the outbreak of the fire."" The zoo has more than 21,000 animals Orangutans at the zoo were among those saved More than 15 fire crews and ambulance staff attended after the blaze broke out just before 11:30 GMT on Saturday. One person was treated for the effects of smoke inhalation. Lee Shears, the incident commander from Cheshire Fire, said crews ""saved a significant portion of the building, which is good news for the zoo and their plans"". The zoo said it had been inundated with messages and donations from members of the public. Mr Christon wrote: ""The strength and support from the public has been incredibly overwhelming and the messages of goodwill have been of great comfort to our teams. ""We will support each other in rebuilding this part of the zoo and continue our mission of preventing extinction."" The zoo officially opened in 1931 and hosts about 500 species The zoo said an investigation would take place over the coming weeks and the Monsoon Forest area and Islands zone remain shut. The Monsoon Forest habitat is the UK's largest zoological building, according to the attraction. It opened in August 2015. The 14-acre section has its own climate, with temperatures reaching 26.6C to replicate conditions in South East Asia.

"Stacey Dooley and Kevin Clifton lifting the Strictly glitterball trophy Stacey Dooley's Strictly Come Dancing journey climaxed on Saturday with her winning the glitterball trophy and the show getting its best ratings of 2018. The grand final drew an average 11.7 million viewers - up on last year's average audience of 11.6 million. Yet the show's peak audience of 12.7 million was down on the 13.1 million who watched last year's at its peak. Documentary maker Dooley's win marked the first time her professional dance partner Kevin Clifton had triumphed. Clifton, who appeared in four previous finals only to miss out on the trophy, was clearly emotional as he was lifted aloft by his fellow professional dancers. This video can not be played Four couples battled it out to be crowned champions Dooley's win - decided by a public vote - came despite her getting fewer marks from the judges than fellow finalists Joe Sugg, Faye Tozer and Ashley Roberts. Speaking on Monday, though, head judge Shirley Ballas said Dooley was a worthy winner as she - unlike Steps singer Tozer and former Pussycat Doll Roberts - had no prior dancing experience. ""She had to learn from scratch where the other girls already had a good ear for music,"" she told BBC Breakfast. Dooley, Ballas continued, ""made a journey that was just absolutely brilliant for a beginner"".

"This video can not be played Supporters of far-right parties took part in the protest Thousands of demonstrators in Brussels have marched against a UN migration pact, adopted in Marrakesh last week. Flemish right-wing parties called the march, which took place near major EU institutions, amid fears the pact could lead to an increase in immigration. Police deployed tear gas and water cannon as clashes broke out. About 5,500 protesters took part. A counter-protest organised by left-wing groups and charities in the city centre drew about 1,000 people. Could the migration crisis finish the EU? Migration to Europe in charts The largest member of Belgium's ruling coalition, the right-wing N-VA party, left the government last Sunday in protest against the prime minister's decision to sign the agreement. Some demonstrators carried signs reading, ""First our people"" In July, 196 UN members agreed theGlobal Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration,external. It was signed by 164 countries in Marrakesh last week, with the US and a number of European states - including Austria, Hungary, Italy, Poland and Slovakia - refusing to formally adopt the agreement. Border-crossing girl dies in US custody Can 'colonial cities' in Africa end migration to Europe? The deal, which is not legally binding, seeks an international approach to migration that ""reaffirms the sovereign rights of states to determine their national migration policy"" and asserts the ""fundamental"" importance of legal migration. But critics in Europe believe it will lead to increased immigration to the continent. This video can not be played UN reaches migrant deal - every country was involved in negotiations except the US Bart Claes, the president of the youth wing of the Flemish nationalist party, Vlaams Belang, told the BBC that people should have been consulted before Belgium signed up to the deal. ""It's been approved apparently,"" he said. ""But the opinion of the people was never asked. That's strange for something that goes this far."" Dries Van Langenhove, from the nationalist youth organisation Schild en Vrienden, agreed, saying the protesters wanted to ""raise our voice against the Marrakesh pact"". ""We think the decision was not made in a democratic way, with a minority in government and a minority of the Belgian people,"" he said. ""That's what we are protesting against."" Authorities used mounted police and water cannon against some of the protesters A smaller number of counter-demonstrators objected to the marchers. ""We want to raise the alarm to show that the organisers of the other demo are fascists groups,"" Naomi Stocker said. ""They advertise hate and discrimination and are violent. We want to warn people and send a different message."" Fellow protester, Barend Claessens, said that although they did not want a confrontation with the ""extreme right"", the counter-demonstrators wished to show ""there are still a lot of people who agree with the pact"".

Pete spoke about his borderline personality disorder, which affects mood and how you interact with others,earlier this month. He wrote on Instagram: ""I've spoken about BPD and being suicidal publicly only in the hopes that it will help bring awareness and help to kids like myself who don't want to be on this earth. ""No matter how hard the internet or anyone tries to make me kill myself. I won't. I'm upset I even have to say this."" Symptoms of BPD can be grouped into four areas, according to the NHS: emotional instability, disturbed patterns of thinking, impulsive behaviour, and intense but unstable relationships. Pete's ex-fiance Ariana Grande appears to have sent a message of support to the comedian in now-deleted tweets. Ariana and Pete broke up earlier this year It appears she went to 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York, where Saturday Night Live is filmed, to support him. ""I'm downstairs and I'm not going anywhere if you need anyone or anything. I know you have everyone you need and that's not me, but I'm here too,"" she wrote. Ariana's ex-boyfriend, the rapper Mac Miller, was found dead at his home in September afteran accidental overdoseinvolving cocaine, alcohol and an opioid drug called fentanyl. Pete and Ariana started dating in May and got engaged in June, but split up in October. Following their break-up, the native New Yorker said he'd been getting ""online bullied and in public by people for nine months"". Newsbeat has contacted NBC for comment.

"Bad weather and the lure of online shopping saw consumers shun UK High Streets on one of the busiest days before Christmas. Retail experts Springboard estimate numbers were 9% lower on Saturday, compared with the same time last year. Including shopping centres and retail parks, footfall was 7.3% lower. Retailers face a number of pressures including rising business rates, the national minimum wage and the impact of Brexit uncertainty on the pound. On Friday and Saturday, Storm Deirdre broughtfreezing temperatures, gales, snow and rain to many parts of the UK, dampening any hope for a pre-Christmas retail bounce. November shopper footfall 'worst since recession' Why are there so many pre-Christmas sales? UK retail sales hit by mild autumn Retailers 'closing 14 shops a day' ""If people are presented with really terrible weather, they then have the choice to shop online, and they can make other choices about what to do with their time,"" said Diane Wehrle, Springboard marketing and insights director. ""That unfortunately offers them sometimes better alternatives than trailing around a town centre or a High Street in freezing cold or rainy weather."" Trade was better on Sunday, with footfall up 0.1% compared to the same day last year. However, Ms Wehrle said this was mainly people who had deferred shopping from Saturday because of Storm Deirdre. Over Saturday and Sunday, Springboard said total footfall dropped by 4.3% against the same weekend in 2017, with the sharpest fall recorded on the High Street and in shopping centres. Ms Wehrle said footfall appeared to have picked up for the early part of last week - with a year-on-year increase of 6.1% in High Streets, shopping centres and retail parks. But she pointed out that snow last year meant that the comparative figures were already low. Ms Wehrle said Saturday's figures were ""severely down"" on last year, on what she described as a ""peak trading weekend"". Shoppers now expect to see discounts all year round Next weekend may be too close to Christmas Day for shoppers to venture out, she added, predicting a difficult week ahead. Ms Wehrle said the trend nowto discount items before Christmas and having all-year-round saleswas affecting consumer's attitude towards price cuts. ""We have come to expect discounts,"" she said. ""By the time we get to Christmas we've seen 20% off, we've seen 30% off, we've had Black Friday."" Despite the gloomy outlook, Rachel Lund, head of insights and analytics at the British Retail Consortium, believes shoppers may still make last-minute purchases in the days running up to 25  December. ""While we have seen a slow start to the Christmas period, changing technology and shopping habits means that many consumers will be leaving their shopping to the last week before Christmas - historically the most important for retailers,"" she said. ""Nonetheless, given the challenging year on the High Street, retailers will be hoping for strong sales this weekend and next as consumers buy both food and presents before Christmas Day."" Why are there so many pre-Christmas sales? Shopper footfall 'worst since recession' Is the shopping centre ready to check out?

"Delegates to the UN climate conference in Poland have reached agreement on how to implement the 2015 Paris Climate Accord, which comes into force in 2020.   What are the key points to come out of the meeting? However dull it may be, the operational rules for the 2015 Paris climate agreement will govern the way the world tackles climate change for decades to come. The key thing was not to unravel the carefully negotiated Paris agreement by having one set of rules for the rich countries and another one for the poor. By that measure the conference was a success with China showing leadership by not pushing for a return to the old ways of countries who did, and countries who didn't. Also helping that effort was the US. Ensuring that the China and the US face similar regulations has long been a key of American policy. Keeping everyone on the same page also delighted the EU. Climate commissioner Miguel Arias Canete explained how the new rules would work. ""We have a system of transparency, we have a system of reporting, we have rules to measure our emissions, we have a system to measure the impacts of our policies compared to what science recommends."" Climate change: Where we are in seven charts What is climate change? To keep everyone in check, the rules will also contain a compliance mechanism, which means that countries that don't submit their reports on time will face an inquiry. The new regulations are ""flexible"" for developing countries, meaning they can sign up to the rules at a later date. One of the biggest rows at this meeting was over a key scientific report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). A group of countries including Saudi Arabia, US, Kuwait and Russia refused to ""welcome"" the IPCC study. They merely wanted to ""note"" the contents. Efforts to find a compromise ended in failure. However that was not the end of the matter. The vast majority of countries felt that acknowledging the science was critical at this conference. Their efforts did finally ensure that the IPCC was recognised - but many felt it was a token effort. ""That science is unsettling and it doesn't connect it to the need to do more,"" said Camilla Born from the environmental think tank E3G. ""The deal looks at it in isolation, it's an elegant compromise but it's not really enough."" Many countries had worried that with the rise of nationalism in many countries and the recent election of Jair Bolsonaro as Brazil's president, the international co-operation needed to tackle climate change might be in danger. For many getting agreement here in Katowice was less about technical rules and more about showing that the international spirit is still alive and has teeth. ""I think the beauty of multilateralism is that it is the effort of everybody,"" said Spanish Ecology Minister Teresa Ribera. ""And what we have seen is that everybody has supported the package, no single country has decided to step down. ""It is very difficult. It is like organising a party for 200 friends, and there's a single menu that everybody has to eat. It is not so easy but we have got it. That's fantastic!"" While negotiators have been congratulating themselves on a job well done in landing the rulebook, there are many voices here who feel that the agreement does not go far enough. They point to the strength of the science, and the public recognition of the impacts of climate change seen this year in heatwaves and wildfires. 2019 10 warmest years 10 coldest years 20th Century average Hotter Colder Source: NOAA Many environmental campaigners believe that Katowice was a missed opportunity for radical action. ""We have ended up here with more of a coal trade fair than a climate convention,"" said Mohamed Adow from Christian Aid, referring to the efforts to promote coal by Poland and the US at this conference. ""We haven't acted in good faith, particularly for the young, that we takes seriously what science is telling us and we are responding to it. That message didn't come through. ""If people think the rulebook is the way to get the world on that path, it is not robust or ambitious enough."" One of the most striking things about this conference of the parties was the presence of energised young people in far greater numbers than I have ever seen them at a COP before. Climate change chimes with young people in a way that is sometimes missing with older people, who make up the bulk of negotiators here. The sense that perhaps this UN process doesn't quite connect with the modern world was summed up best by Mohamed Nasheed, the former president of the Maldives and now their lead climate negotiator. ""Almost 10 years since I was last at these climate negotiations, I must say, nothing much seems to have changed. ""We are still using the same old, dinosaur language. Still saying the same old words. ""Still making the same tedious points."" It would be hard to argue with this view given the shenanigans that played out at the end, when one country, Brazil, held up progress at the talks on one issue for a couple of days. Perhaps the most memorable image of this meeting was that of 15-year-old Swedish student Greta Thunberg. This teenager who has organised school strikes in Sweden held daily press conferences here to drive home her message that platitudes and warm words just aren't enough anymore.

"This video can not be played Why are Russian rappers getting arrested? Russian President Vladimir Putin has asked the government to ""take charge"" of rap music after a number of concerts were cancelled across the country. Efforts to ban rap were ""impossible"" and so the state should play a greater role in controlling it, he said. The Ministry of Culture would find the best way to ""navigate"" youth concerts, he added. His comments come afterRussian rapper Husky was arrestedafter several of his concerts were cancelled. In December, authorities in the southern city of Krasnodar called off his planned performance for ""extremism"". The musician - real name Dmitry Kuznetsov - was then jailed for 12 days after performing for fans on the roof of a car. A number of Russian rap concerts have been cancelled recently Speaking at a meeting of the presidential Council for Culture and Art in St Petersburg, President Putin said the problem should be approached ""with great caution"". ""However, what I really agree with is that if it is impossible to stop it, it should be taken over and navigated in a particular way,"" he said. The unexpected facts about music in Russia Who are the hypebeasts of Russia? The president expressed particular concern about drug abuse among young people. ""Rap and other modern [forms of art] are rested upon three pillars - sex, drugs and protest,"" he said. ""I am most worried about drugs. This is the way towards the degradation of a nation."" President Putin believes rap should be controlled, not banned Mr Putin also said he was worried about bad language in rap, saying he had spoken to a linguist about it. While she had explained to him that swearing is ""a part of our language"", Mr Putin compared it to the human body, joking that ""we have all sorts of body parts, and it's not like we put them on display all the time"".

"The rollout of smart motorways, where the hard shoulder has been permanently converted into a fourth lane, should be stopped, a group of MPs says. The all-party group backed campaigners who say having no hard shoulder puts motorists and recovery workers at risk. England has more than 100 miles (161km) of All Lane Running (ALR) smart motorways, with 225 miles more planned. MP Tracey Crouch said the rollout should be paused, but Highways England said ALR smart motorways were safe. Smart motorways work by using the hard shoulder as a fourth lane, with variable speed limits to control the flow of traffic. This video can not be played Recovery drivers have spoken about the dangers of having no hard shoulder There are three main types of smart motorways in the UK: controlled dynamic hard shoulder - where the hard shoulder is used as a lane in busy traffic ALR - where the hard shoulder is permanently a fourth lane Ellie Montgomery's car was hit on the M6 It is the ALR schemes which are the most common and that are causing the greatest concern. Figures from Highways England, obtained by the RAC via a Freedom of Information request, show that at the end of 2017 there were 100 miles of ALR motorway in England. Last year, on these stretches there were 16 crashes across all lanes which caused injury involving stationary vehicles, such as broken-down cars. The figures also show that over the same period, there were 29 similar crashes involving vehicles parked up on the hard shoulder for the whole of the rest of the network in England - which includes about 1,800 miles of road. Ellie Montgomery, her husband, and three young daughters were hit by a lorry last December when their vehicle broke down on the M6 in Cheshire. The family's people carrier came to an abrupt halt in a live lane and there was no hard shoulder for them to pull on to. It was sealed off because the stretch of motorway concerned was being converted into a smart motorway. Samantha Cockerill and her partner Steve Godbold A heavy goods vehicle (HGV) travelling at 50mph ploughed into the back of their vehicle. Ellie, her husband Duncan, and one of their children were knocked unconscious, while Ellie suffered a hairline fracture to the base of her neck. She told BBC 5 live Investigates they were ""a sitting duck"" with no hard shoulder. ""It turns the motorway into a deathtrap. There is no amount of technology that can overcome the danger of not having a hard shoulder as a safety net."" M4 'smart motorway' upgrade work under way 'Smart motorway' offenders could be offered retraining Plans to fine drivers flouting smart motorway rules The Campaign for Safer Roadside Rescue and Recovery (CSRRR) wants the rollout of this ALR scheme to be stopped - and for recovery workers to be able to use red flashing lights rather than orange. The campaign is being led by Samantha Cockerill - whose partner Steve Godbold, a vehicle recovery worker, was killed in September 2017 when an HGV strayed on to the hard shoulder of the M25. She calls the new ALR smart motorways ""crazy"" and says they increase the risk to recovery workers. She is now being backed by the all-party parliamentary group, Tracey Crouch, Conservative MP for Chatham and Aylesford, who sits on the group, told 5 live Investigates the rollout should be halted with immediate effect. ""We need the government to pause and reflect on whether we're getting this right,"" she said. The introduction of ALR smart motorways should be halted ""until we have a better understanding about how we can protect those who have broken down and the recovery workers that come to assist them"", she added. Use an emergency refuge area if possible If possible, leave your vehicle safely, and ring Highways England If you can, drive your vehicle as close to the nearside verge or the nearside boundary as possible Always, switch on your hazard warning lights. If you can't get out of your vehicle safely, or there is nowhere of relative safety to wait, stay in your vehicle with your seat belt on and dial 999 Source:Highways England,external Highways England, which operates the motorway network, says the technology used on smart motorways makes journeys more reliable and insists they are as safe as traditional motorways. It says they will continue to make design changes - including introducing systems that detect stationary vehicles. ""We recognise that as well as being safe, drivers want to feel safe and we have and will continue to make some changes to the design of motorways,"" it said in a statement. The organisation also said it was prioritising raising awareness of the need to comply with lane closures and, where practical, reducing the distance between emergency refuge areas to a maximum of one mile.

"Stacey Dooley and Kevin Clifton lifting the Strictly glitterball trophy Stacey Dooley's Strictly Come Dancing journey climaxed on Saturday with her winning the glitterball trophy and the show getting its best ratings of 2018. The grand final drew an average 11.7 million viewers - up on last year's average audience of 11.6 million. Yet the show's peak audience of 12.7 million was down on the 13.1 million who watched last year's at its peak. Documentary maker Dooley's win marked the first time her professional dance partner Kevin Clifton had triumphed. Clifton, who appeared in four previous finals only to miss out on the trophy, was clearly emotional as he was lifted aloft by his fellow professional dancers. This video can not be played Four couples battled it out to be crowned champions Dooley's win - decided by a public vote - came despite her getting fewer marks from the judges than fellow finalists Joe Sugg, Faye Tozer and Ashley Roberts. Speaking on Monday, though, head judge Shirley Ballas said Dooley was a worthy winner as she - unlike Steps singer Tozer and former Pussycat Doll Roberts - had no prior dancing experience. ""She had to learn from scratch where the other girls already had a good ear for music,"" she told BBC Breakfast. Dooley, Ballas continued, ""made a journey that was just absolutely brilliant for a beginner"". Her words were echoed by Strictly professional Anton Du Beke, who said her victory was ""the epitome of the Strictly journey"". ""It was a brilliant end to a brilliant season,"" he told Radio 2's Chris Evans on Monday, saying ""the nation's favourite"" had emerged triumphant. Stacey and partner Kevin Clifton performed their ""Paso Dooley"" in the final Speaking on ITV's Lorraine programme earlier, Tozer said she was ""so happy"" for Dooley and Clifton while making the point that Strictly has ""always had a mix of abilities"". ""What a ride,"" she said of her own experience on the show. ""It's been the hardest thing I've ever done and probably the most rewarding."" Tozer also appeared to confirm that Joe Sugg and his dancing partner Dianne Buswell are in a relationship - something Sugg himself seemed to be suggesting in a teasing Instagram post. ""I may not have won the glitter ball, but I've won something a million times more special,"" the YouTube star wrote on Sunday. Allow Instagram content?

"Theresa May has attacked one of her predecessors - accusing Tony Blair of ""undermining"" the Brexit talks by calling for another referendum. She called his comments an ""insult to the office he once held"" and said MPs could not ""abdicate responsibility"" to deliver Brexit by holding a new poll. In London last week, Mr Blair said MPs might back a new vote if ""none of the other options work"". In response to Mrs May, he insisted that a new referendum was democratic. ""Far from being anti-democratic it would be the opposite, as indeed many senior figures in her party from past and present have been saying,"" he said. On Thursday about 10 Labour MPs met David Lidington - who is Mrs May's de facto second-in-command - to argue for another public vote. Sources close to Mr Lidington said it was ""pretty standard stuff"" and he was not ""planning for or advocating a second referendum"". Many senior Labour figures are deeply uneasy about endorsing another referendum. Reality Check: How could another Brexit referendum work? Kuenssberg: An issue of trust New Brexit poll logical outcome - Blair Analysis: Labour's referendum strains The government is also opposed to any further referendum, saying the public made a clear choice when they voted in 2016 to leave by a margin of 51.9% to 48.1%. BBC political correspondent Chris Mason said Mrs May's criticism of the former Labour prime minister was striking for its anger. Mrs May said: ""For Tony Blair to go to Brussels and seek to undermine our negotiations by advocating for a second referendum is an insult to the office he once held and the people he once served. She added: ""We cannot, as he would, abdicate responsibility for this decision. ""Parliament has a democratic duty to deliver what the British people voted for."" Meanwhile, the PM's chief of staff, Gavin Barwell, has responded to reports in the Mail on Sunday that he told colleagues another referendum was ""the only way out of this"", sayingon Twitter,external: ""Happy to confirm I am not planning a 2nd referendum with political opponents (or anyone else, to anticipate the next question).""

MPs were due to vote on Mrs May's Brexit deal last Tuesday, but it was postponed when the prime minister admitted it would have been ""rejected by a significant margin"". After postponing the vote in Parliament, Mrs May travelled to Brussels to make a special plea to European Union leaders, in a bid to make her deal more acceptable to MPs. However, the EU said there could beclarification but not renegotiation. This video can not be played Theresa May: 'If we are to leave with a deal this is it' The Labour leadership has been under pressure to call a vote of no confidence in the government. But Labour frontbencher Andrew Gwynne told the BBC's Andrew Marr: ""We can't move to the next stage until Parliament has decided whether or not to back the prime minister's deal."" He said the party would be using ""parliamentary tactics"" to try to bring the MPs' ""meaningful vote"" on the deal - which was delayed by the government last week in expectation of a heavy defeat - forward to this week. Asked whether his party would campaign for Brexit under a Labour deal if there were to be another referendum on the issue, he said: ""Let's wait and see. These things are moving very quickly. ""We are a democratic party and we will put our decision to the party members in a democratic way before we decide what the next steps are."" More Brexit assurances possible, says May Theresa May's week in charts Reality Check: Does Brussels blink? Many of Mrs May's Conservative MPs are concerned that the ""backstop"" - which is aimed at preventing a hard border in Northern Ireland - would keep the UK tied to EU rules and limit its ability to strike trade deals. Education Secretary Damian Hinds has told the BBC a second referendum would not end the deadlock over Brexit but might simply extend the impasse. Speaking on BBC Breakfast, he urged politicians to back the PM's plan, describing it as ""balanced"" and the ""best of both worlds"". Mr Hinds accused some in Parliament of ""wishful thinking"" in believing they will get something closer to their own view by rejecting Mrs May's deal, adding: ""There is really no reason to believe that's true."" Meanwhile,in an interview with the Sunday Telegraph,external, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has said the UK will ""flourish and prosper"" even if it leaves the EU with no deal. ""We've faced much bigger challenges in our history,"" he said. ""But we shouldn't pretend that there wouldn't be disruption, there wouldn't be risk, and there wouldn't be impact and that's why as a responsible government we have to make all the preparations necessary He also said he wanted a ""crack"" at succeeding Mrs May after the PM takes the country through ""this challenging next few months"". His comments come after Mrs May made it clear she would step down before the next general election - due in 2022. How could another Brexit referendum work?

"Chairman Michal Kurtyka was in high spirits as the conference reached agreement Negotiators in Poland have finally secured agreement on a range of measures that will make the Paris climate pact operational in 2020. Last-minute rows over carbon markets threatened to derail the two-week summit - and delayed it by a day. Delegates believe the new rules will ensure that countries keep their promises to cut carbon. The Katowice agreement aims to deliver the Paris goals of limiting global temperature rises to well below 2C. ""Putting together the Paris agreement work programme is a big responsibility,"" said the chairman of the talks, known as COP24, Michal Kurtyka. ""It has been a long road. We did our best to leave no-one behind."" Five things we've learnt at COP24 Climate change: Where we are in seven charts What is climate change? This video can not be played No more beef? Five things you can do to help stop rising global temperatures The summit accord, reached by 196 states, outlinesplans for a common rulebook for all countries,external- regulations that will govern the nuts and bolts of how countries cut carbon, provide finance to poorer nations and ensure that everyone is doing what they say they are doing. Sorting out the rulebook  sounds easy but is very technical. Countries often have different definitions and timetables for their carbon cutting actions. US, Saudis and Russia block climate report Failure to tackle warming 'suicidal' Poorer countries want some ""flexibility"" in the rules so that they are not overwhelmed with regulations that they don't have the capacity to put into practice. 2019 10 warmest years 10 coldest years 20th Century average Hotter Colder Source: NOAA The idea of being legally liable for causing climate change has long been rejected by richer nations, who fear huge bills well into the future. A deadlock between Brazil and other countries over the rules for the monitoring of carbon credits threatened to derail the talks. Carbon trading: How does it work? Brazil had been pushing for a weaker set of rules on carbon markets, despite strong opposition from many other countries. These discussions have now been deferred until next year. Further tensions emerged last weekend, scientists and delegates were shocked when the US, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Kuwaitobjected to the meeting ""welcoming"" a recent UN reporton keeping global temperature rise to within the 1.5C limit. The report said the world is now completely off track, heading more towards 3C this century. In a compromise, the final statement from the summit welcomed the ""completion"" of the report and invited countries to make use of it. Laurence Tubiana, a key architect of the Paris agreement, and now with the European Climate Foundation, said the agreement was a big boost for the Paris pact. ""The key piece was having a good transparency system because it builds trust between countries and because we can measure what is being done and it is precise enough,"" she told BBC News on the sidelines of this meeting. This video can not be played Matt McGrath explains why we should care about climate change ""I am happy with that. Nobody can say that's not clear, we don't know what to do, or that it's not true anymore. It's very clear,"" She said that countries like Russia- which had refused to ratify the Paris agreement because it wasn't sure about the rules - could no longer use that excuse. However some observers say the deal is not sufficiently strong to deal with the urgency of the climate problem. In the words of one delegate, ""it's what's possible, but not what's necessary"". There has been a big push for countries to up their ambition, to cut carbon deeper and with greater urgency. Many delegates want to see a rapid increase in ambition before 2020 to keep the chances of staying under 1.5C alive. Right now, the plans that countries lodged as part of the Paris agreement don't get anywhere near that, described as ""grossly insufficient"" by one delegate from a climate vulnerable country. Business is also looking for a signal from this meeting about the future. ""Companies are ready to invest and banks are ready to finance,"" said Carlos Salle from Spanish energy conglomerate, Iberdrola. ""So we need that greater ambition in the policy to enable business to move further and faster."" Climate change: Where we are in seven charts What's your diet's carbon footprint?

"Maintenance of the two Severn bridges costs on average Â£6m a year Sunday marked the final day of a centuries-old tax of paying to cross between south Wales and south-west England before the toll is removed. Charges on the M4 and M48 Severn bridges will be axed on Monday - saving commuters as much as Â£1,400 a year. People have had to pay to cross the Severn Estuary, with its treacherous tides, since Roman times, be it in a car, in a train or on a ferry. The first written reference to the ferry is in a 12th Century document. ""Monday will be a very historic day,"" said historian Anne Rainsbury. ""It'll be the first time you can cross the Severn Estuary for free."" The charge for vehicles has been scrapped after the bridges returned to public ownership last year. How the Severn Bridge Was Built Bridging the divide Test your Severn Bridge knowledge Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns paid the final toll on the M4 bridge Car drivers had to pay two shillings and sixpence each way after the first Severn bridge was opened by the Queen in 1966. Recently, the Severn toll spiralled to Â£5.60 - but the charge was just one way, westbound heading into south Wales. This video can not be played The ferry was once the only way to cross the Severn estuary by car - so avoiding a two-and-a-half hour detour by road ""It has been forever thus,"" added Ms Rainsbury, curator of Chepstow Museum on the Welsh side of the original bridge. ""You've always had to pay someone; a ferryman, a railway company or a bridge toll collector to cross the Severn Estuary - so Monday's removal of the tolls is a hugely significant moment, especially in Wales."" The first ferry crossing over the Severn Estuary - which has the second highest tidal range in the world -  was between Aust and Beachley, essentially the path of the first bridge, on the narrowest width of the estuary. The first recorded passenger ferry across the Severn Estuary is believed to be 1775 The first written reference to it is in a document from the 12th Century when the owner was the Lord of the Manor of Tidenham, part of the Chepstow Lordship. But the first recorded ferry crossing was in 1775, when it cost a coach with six horses an eye-watering 16 shillings to board the boat on the mile-long route known as the old passage. ""It was a huge amount back then,"" said local historian Tim Ryan, who is trying to restore one of the old Severn ferries. The Beachley-Aust ferry ran from 1931 until the original Severn bridge opened in 1966 ""But if you could afford a coach and six horses, then you could afford the fee - and it would avoid a three-day, 55-mile trek around Gloucester to the nearest crossing of the river."" There was a rival and more direct crossing two miles downstream at the so-called new passage, thought to be in operation from 1630, between Pilning and Portskewett. Both crossings - and a passenger ferry that ran directly between Chepstow and Bristol - were killed off when the Severn tunnel, then the world's longest under-sea rail tunnel, connecting London with south Wales opened in 1886. The advent of the motor car revitalised the Aust-Beachley ferry and it started again in 1926 - running for 40 years and finishing the day before the first Severn bridge was opened. A picture of Bob Dylan waiting for the Severn ferry was on the cover of the soundtrack to Martin Scorsese's documentary of Dylan FamouslyBob Dylan used a 1966 picture of himself as he waited for the Severn ferryon the cover of his album No Direction Home - the soundtrack to Martin Scorsese's documentary about the music icon. The Queen opened the Â£8m first bridge in 1966 while the second bridge, built three miles downstream across the Severn Estuary, was financed by a private consortium set up in 1992. This video can not be played BBC archive: the day the Severn Bridge opened 50 years ago This video can not be played Demolition teams dismantle the bridge's toll booth The Second Severn Crossing - opened in 1996 and renamed the Prince of Wales Bridge in July this year - cost Â£332m to construct, but the eventual repayments including debt repayments, interest and tax totalled more than Â£1.3bn. The removal of the Severn tolls is ""history in the making"", according to Anne Rainsbury, and will boost the Welsh economy by an estimated Â£100m. The M4 Prince of Wales Bridge isshut overnightas maintenance teams demolish the toll booths in readiness for toll-free free-flowing traffic. It will reopen free-flowing and toll-free before Monday morning's rush hour - at a time yet to be confirmed - but with a 50mph speed restriction on temporary narrow lanes. Shortly after the M4 bridge reopens on Monday, the M48 original Severn crossing will shut westbound until Wednesday for the tolls there to be dismantled. Further work will be carried out in 2019 to return both routes to a three-lane motorway with the usual 70mph speed limit.

"This video can not be played Liam Fox: 'How do we tell the SNP that they can't have another referendum on independence?' Parliament might have to decide what to do next if Theresa May's Brexit deal is rejected by MPs, cabinet minister Liam Fox has said. The senior Brexiteer said the PM's deal was unlikely to pass through Parliament unless the backstop issue was resolved. He said one option could be a ""free vote"" for MPs. An alternative being widely suggested is another referendum - but Mr Fox told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show this was unlikely and would not ""heal division"". Other options backed by different groups of MPs include leaving without a deal, another referendum, or Norway or Canada-style alternative deals.Norway has a very close relationshipwith the EU but is not a member, whileCanada has an extensive trade dealwith the bloc. New Brexit poll 'logical outcome' says Blair Reality check: Another EU referendum Education Secretary Damian Hinds has also suggested ""flushing out"" the levels of Parliamentary support for different Brexit options although he told BBC Radio5Live's Pienaar's Politics there was not a majority for any of them. And Lib Dem MP Tom Brake, who is part of the anti-Brexit ""Best for Britain"" campaign, said: ""When even Dr Fox does not rule out free votes and encourages the idea of indicative votes in Parliament, the Brexit project is clearly in jeopardy."" By BBC political correspondent Chris Mason What we are witnessing is a bursting out in public of conversations that have been happening for a while, at a senior level, in private. They can be summarised like this: 'What on earth do we do next?' One idea, now floated by three cabinet ministers in public, and others privately, is a series of so called ""indicative votes"". These would flush out Parliament's view on a range of options which could include different models of Brexit: something akin to Norway's relationship with the EU for instance, or Canada's looser one. Another referendum and no deal are other possibilities. Some ponder doing this before the vote on the prime minister's deal, in the hope it highlights that her plan is the only workable Brexit deal achievable now. ""Things are not as hopeless as they look,"" one cabinet minister told me. But when I wished them a merry Christmas and a happy new year, that word 'happy' was met with a wry smile. None of this is remotely straight forward. On the possibility of another referendum, International Trade Secretary Mr Fox said one could result in a narrow Remain win on a lower turnout, in which case, ""People like me will be immediately demanding that it's best of three - where does that end up?"" It comes after Theresa Mayaccused former Labour PM Tony Blair of undermining Brexit negotiations by calling for another referendumamid continuing calls for one to be held to solve the impasse over the UK's exit from the European Union. Two of Mrs May's key allies - chief of staff, Gavin Barwell, and her effective second-in-command David Lidington - distanced themselves from reports they were involved in planning for a new referendum. On Thursday about 10 Labour MPs met Mr Lidington to argue for another public vote. Mr Lidingtontweeted,externalthat he had told the Commons last week that another referendum would be ""divisive"" and would not guarantee a ""decisive"" ending to the debate. Mr Barwell alsoused Twitter to say,externalhe did not want another referendum and was not planning one. Mrs May met EU leaders on Thursday - after postponing a Commons vote on the withdrawal deal she has negotiated, fearing its heavy defeat. The government says the Commons vote will go ahead in January, as talks continue with the EU on the issue of the Irish border ""backstop"". This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. The backstop is an insurance policy in the withdrawal deal to prevent the return of a hard border with Northern Ireland if no trade deal is reached - but many of Mrs May's MPs say they cannot support it, arguing it would keep the UK tied to EU rules indefinitely and curb its ability to strike trade deals. EU leaders have said the deal is ""not open for renegotiation"" - but that there could be some further clarification. Mr Fox said talks would continue over Christmas and the new year. He said it was ""clear"" that the EU understood the problem, and it was now a question of finding a ""mechanism"" that would remove MPs' concerns, without which, he suggested it would not be worth putting it to a Commons vote ""knowing it would be rejected"". If the deal could not get through the Commons, he said: ""Parliament would have to decide on the alternatives.""

"The former prime minister can see a clear path to another referendum When the party of government is conducting something akin to a political civil - or perhaps that should be uncivil - war, the main party of opposition will seem united by comparison. Certainly Theresa May's deal has succeeded in bringing her opponents together to denounce it. But according to the former Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair, the position of both frontbenches on Brexit is ""weird"". He believes Theresa May is wasting time seeking to resuscitate a deal that he has pronounced as dead. And there is the spectacle of the current Labour leader holding back from tabling a confidence motion in a government he wants to remove. More about that laterâ¦ Tony Blair now puts the likelihood of a new referendum at ""above the 50% mark"". He revealed that he had been speaking to Labour MPs who represent Leave areas in recent weeks. He's been trying to reassure them that giving people a final say wouldn't  lead to Brexit-backing voters call time on their parliamentary careers. His argument is that a referendum would be framed as a regretful consequence of a gridlocked parliament. But their fears are not the only, indeed, not the main, barrier to gaining a new referendum. Labour's official policy is to call for a general election. And, if that doesn't happen, to keep all options on the table - including campaigning for a ""public vote"". This just about kept the party united at its annual conference in the autumn, But now the strains are beginning to show. Again there is unity around calling on Theresa May to bring her deal to Parliament next week rather than waiting until January. Beyond that, the parliamentary party's apparent solidity begins to fracture. There have been tensions at the top of the party over the issue MPs who back  Tony Blair's position on a referendum  - such as Chuka Umunna - have called on Jeremy Corbyn to table a motion of no confidence in the government. The calculation is that it would fail because the DUP (on this issue at least) would back the Conservatives. That would then tick the policy box - Labour has asked for an election, hasn't got it, and now it can move on to at the very least discussing the option of a new referendum. But because it wouldn't succeed in bringing the government down, Jeremy Corbyn is unlikely to table a formal vote of confidence next week. He is also not enthusiastic about confronting the prospect of a new referendum as a consequence. Instead, we may well see a non-binding censure motion being tabled if Theresa May indeed delays the vote on her deal. So, political damage could be inflicted on the Prime Minister without it rebounding and causing a problem for the Opposition leadership. But as Tony Blair's  former spin doctor Alastair Campbell - a leading advocate for a new referendum - warned his fellow campaigners: ""it may be time to face up to the fact that Labour under Jeremy Corbyn will do everything to make sure a People's Vote won't happen"". Certainly - from a different perspective - that is Labour leaver Kate Hoey's view of Jeremy Corbyn's position too. She and he were both Eurosceptic rebels through the Blair and Brown years. And while the option of a ""public vote"" is Labour policy, I understand behind the scenes in the shadow cabinet the issue is proving highly contentious. People's Vote campaigners want Labour to come on board and quickly I am told that party chairman Ian Lavery and shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon have been arguing strongly against committing the party to a referendum - even further down the line. Jon Trickett and - perhaps unsurprisingly, given his public statements - the shadow international trade secretary Barry Gardiner take a similar view. The shadow education secretary Angela Rayner was never seen as a staunch opponent of the idea but did suggest another referendum could be seen as ""undermining democracy"" on BBC's Question Time. The shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said at Labour's conference - without clearing it with his party leader - that Remain should be an option if there were a new referendum. But I am told privately he has been quite cautious about when to commit to a new vote - and whether it could be won. The shadow chancellor John McDonnell's relatively warm language towards the referendum option in recent weeks - even agreeing that under certain circumstances it could become ""inevitable"" - has led to tensions with the leader's office. Many younger activists in Momentum - the movement John McDonnell and ally Jon Lansman set up  - support the position of ""remain and reform"" the EU and the left-wing Another Europe Is Possible - along with unions such as the GMB and TSSA - want a new vote. There are those in Labour's ranks who think there is a ""third way"" between rejecting the May deal and signing up to a new vote. The chair of the Commons Brexit committee, Hilary Benn, favours a 'Norway Plus' option - staying economically close to the EU but outside its political structures. This video can not be played Tony Blair tells Today the EU would help the UK remain if it was ""prepared to think again"" This video can not be played Rayner: New referendum 'undermines democracy' He wants Parliament to be able to vote on this option but I am told that Jeremy Corbyn does not want to embrace this policy, which would involve staying inside the single market. Tony Blair's prediction is this: He doesn't necessarily think that the current Labour leadership will ever embrace a new popular vote. But if Parliament rejects every other option, he believes Labour MPs will be faced with a stark choice between extending Article 50 and backing a new referendum, or leaving with no deal. Under these circumstances, he argues, an ""overwhelming"" number of Labour MPs would opt for a new vote - and could cite party policy as cover. Hilary Benn isn't so sure. He also thinks there is a danger that Parliament rejects all options - including his favourite, Norway. But that this wouldn't necessarily lead to a new referendum. ""All of the options have real and genuine difficulties,"" he toldRadio 4's 'Political Thinking' podcast. ""All of the options have real and genuine difficulties.

"This video can not be played Members of the public filmed the fire as it took hold Chester Zoo says it is ""devastated"" by the loss of some of its animals in a fire. The blaze broke out in the Monsoon Forest area on Saturday, destroying much of its roof. Orangutans, macaques, gibbons and larger birds were saved, but some frogs, fish, insects and small birds died. Cheshire Fire said the blaze was ""accidental"" but it needed more time to determine the exact cause. An online appeal launched by the zoo, which reopened on Sunday, has raised more than Â£100,000 in 24 hours - double its target. The fire broke out on Saturday morning The tourism attraction, which has more than 21,000 animals, said all the creatures led to safety were being relocated within the 125-acre site and described the loss of others as ""heartbreaking"". Jamie Christon, the zoo's chief operating officer,said in a statement,external: ""Yesterday was one of the toughest days in Chester Zoo's long history. ""Keepers were able to encourage all mammal species away from the fire and to safety - including the zoo's group of critically endangered Sumatran orangutans, Sulawesi macaques, endangered silvery gibbons and birds such as rhinoceros hornbills. ""We are though, devastated to say that we were unable to save some of our insects, frogs, fish and small birds who were located near to the outbreak of the fire."" The zoo has more than 21,000 animals Orangutans at the zoo were among those saved More than 15 fire crews and ambulance staff attended after the blaze broke out just before 11:30 GMT on Saturday. One person was treated for the effects of smoke inhalation. Lee Shears, the incident commander from Cheshire Fire, said crews ""saved a significant portion of the building, which is good news for the zoo and their plans"". The zoo said it had been inundated with messages and donations from members of the public. Mr Christon wrote: ""The strength and support from the public has been incredibly overwhelming and the messages of goodwill have been of great comfort to our teams. ""We will support each other in rebuilding this part of the zoo and continue our mission of preventing extinction."" The zoo officially opened in 1931 and hosts about 500 species The zoo said an investigation would take place over the coming weeks and the Monsoon Forest area and Islands zone remain shut. The Monsoon Forest habitat is the UK's largest zoological building, according to the attraction. It opened in August 2015.

"Tony Hendrickson, co-ordinator of anti-radicalisation project Resilience, said Welsh schools are key to combating far right extremism Wales has become a ""hunting ground"" for the far right, the leader of an anti-radicalisation project has warned. Young, poor, vulnerable people are most susceptible to recruitment, said Tony Hendrickson, co-ordinator of the lottery-fundedResilience,externalproject. He explained teachers need to be better at spotting and reacting to racism in order to ""counter the narrative"". The Welsh Government said it expects schools and local authorities to comply with counter-terrorism legislation. Mr Hendrickson, 54, who grew up in Llanrumney, Cardiff, is the new co-ordinator of Resilience, which is run by charity Ethnic Minorities and Youth Support Team (EYST). 'I joined the far right at 15' Far right group recruits in Wales Hollyoaks character to be groomed in far-right plot His warning comes asnew figures,externalreveal a36% rise in people referred to the UK's terrorism-prevention programme, Prevent, over right-wing extremism. A lack of diversity in large parts of Wales makes it easier for the far right narrative to take hold ""because it is easier to alienate people if you don't know them"", Mr Hendrickson explained. He added the far right issue is a bigger problem in Wales than Islamist extremism, and has grown as a movement since the Brexit referendum and the election of Donald Trump. ""The Islamist problem has never been that big. If Muslims had really bought into that, there would have been bombs going off every day,"" he said. The project aims to build the ability of young, vulnerable people to resist radicalisation and exploitation Resilience was set up in response to Prevent,which was criticised by some for being ""Islamophobic"". It works with vulnerable young people at risk of political or religious radicalisation - both to the far right and to Islamic extremism - or sexual exploitation. ""Resilience is about providing a response - a counter narrative,"" explained Mr Hendrickson. Working in schools, youth centres, colleges and prisons, he said most of the work his team do is pre-emptive, increasing the ability of vulnerable young people to resist radicalisation or exploitation. Mr Hendrickson said school staff need to be more aware of racist attitudes among pupils. ""A lot of schools are still struggling with incidents of racism - either they don't recognise it or they are uncomfortable to respond,"" he said. ""I don't blame parents but something should be happening at school. We are living in a diverse society, we need to have these discussions."" He used the example of a Syrian boy who was getting into trouble at school to illustrate the problem. ""One of our workers went to the school to speak to the boy, and found out he was being racially bullied,"" he said. ""When he raised that with the teachers, they hadn't recognised that at all."" The Resilience project works in schools, youth centres and colleges to ""counter the narrative"" of right wing extremism Mr Hendrickson called for diversity education similar to sex education. He claimed the problem of far right extremism is ""cyclical"" and ""will get worse before it gets better"". ""The far right has been emboldened by the rise of UKIP, and to some degree the main parties have bought into that narrative,"" he added. ""The far right will only ever be violent because the narrative is based on anger and aggression: it's not about dialogue and getting people around the table. For them, it's 'us' against 'them', a race war.""

"Tony Hendrickson, co-ordinator of anti-radicalisation project Resilience, said Welsh schools are key to combating far right extremism Wales has become a ""hunting ground"" for the far right, the leader of an anti-radicalisation project has warned. Young, poor, vulnerable people are most susceptible to recruitment, said Tony Hendrickson, co-ordinator of the lottery-fundedResilience,externalproject. He explained teachers need to be better at spotting and reacting to racism in order to ""counter the narrative"". The Welsh Government said it expects schools and local authorities to comply with counter-terrorism legislation. Mr Hendrickson, 54, who grew up in Llanrumney, Cardiff, is the new co-ordinator of Resilience, which is run by charity Ethnic Minorities and Youth Support Team (EYST). 'I joined the far right at 15' Far right group recruits in Wales Hollyoaks character to be groomed in far-right plot His warning comes asnew figures,externalreveal a36% rise in people referred to the UK's terrorism-prevention programme, Prevent, over right-wing extremism. A lack of diversity in large parts of Wales makes it easier for the far right narrative to take hold ""because it is easier to alienate people if you don't know them"", Mr Hendrickson explained. He added the far right issue is a bigger problem in Wales than Islamist extremism, and has grown as a movement since the Brexit referendum and the election of Donald Trump. ""The Islamist problem has never been that big. If Muslims had really bought into that, there would have been bombs going off every day,"" he said. The project aims to build the ability of young, vulnerable people to resist radicalisation and exploitation Resilience was set up in response to Prevent,which was criticised by some for being ""Islamophobic"". It works with vulnerable young people at risk of political or religious radicalisation - both to the far right and to Islamic extremism - or sexual exploitation. ""Resilience is about providing a response - a counter narrative,"" explained Mr Hendrickson. Working in schools, youth centres, colleges and prisons, he said most of the work his team do is pre-emptive, increasing the ability of vulnerable young people to resist radicalisation or exploitation. Mr Hendrickson said school staff need to be more aware of racist attitudes among pupils. ""A lot of schools are still struggling with incidents of racism - either they don't recognise it or they are uncomfortable to respond,"" he said. ""I don't blame parents but something should be happening at school. We are living in a diverse society, we need to have these discussions."" He used the example of a Syrian boy who was getting into trouble at school to illustrate the problem. ""One of our workers went to the school to speak to the boy, and found out he was being racially bullied,"" he said. ""When he raised that with the teachers, they hadn't recognised that at all."" The Resilience project works in schools, youth centres and colleges to ""counter the narrative"" of right wing extremism Mr Hendrickson called for diversity education similar to sex education. He claimed the problem of far right extremism is ""cyclical"" and ""will get worse before it gets better"". ""The far right has been emboldened by the rise of UKIP, and to some degree the main parties have bought into that narrative,"" he added. ""The far right will only ever be violent because the narrative is based on anger and aggression: it's not about dialogue and getting people around the table. For them, it's 'us' against 'them', a race war."" A Welsh Government spokesperson said: ""The UK Government published the Prevent Duty Guidance for England and Wales for specified bodies including education providers.

"Delegates to the UN climate conference in Poland have reached agreement on how to implement the 2015 Paris Climate Accord, which comes into force in 2020.   What are the key points to come out of the meeting? However dull it may be, the operational rules for the 2015 Paris climate agreement will govern the way the world tackles climate change for decades to come. The key thing was not to unravel the carefully negotiated Paris agreement by having one set of rules for the rich countries and another one for the poor. By that measure the conference was a success with China showing leadership by not pushing for a return to the old ways of countries who did, and countries who didn't. Also helping that effort was the US. Ensuring that the China and the US face similar regulations has long been a key of American policy. Keeping everyone on the same page also delighted the EU. Climate commissioner Miguel Arias Canete explained how the new rules would work. ""We have a system of transparency, we have a system of reporting, we have rules to measure our emissions, we have a system to measure the impacts of our policies compared to what science recommends."" Climate change: Where we are in seven charts What is climate change? To keep everyone in check, the rules will also contain a compliance mechanism, which means that countries that don't submit their reports on time will face an inquiry. The new regulations are ""flexible"" for developing countries, meaning they can sign up to the rules at a later date. One of the biggest rows at this meeting was over a key scientific report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). A group of countries including Saudi Arabia, US, Kuwait and Russia refused to ""welcome"" the IPCC study. They merely wanted to ""note"" the contents. Efforts to find a compromise ended in failure. However that was not the end of the matter. The vast majority of countries felt that acknowledging the science was critical at this conference. Their efforts did finally ensure that the IPCC was recognised - but many felt it was a token effort. ""That science is unsettling and it doesn't connect it to the need to do more,"" said Camilla Born from the environmental think tank E3G. ""The deal looks at it in isolation, it's an elegant compromise but it's not really enough."" Many countries had worried that with the rise of nationalism in many countries and the recent election of Jair Bolsonaro as Brazil's president, the international co-operation needed to tackle climate change might be in danger. For many getting agreement here in Katowice was less about technical rules and more about showing that the international spirit is still alive and has teeth. ""I think the beauty of multilateralism is that it is the effort of everybody,"" said Spanish Ecology Minister Teresa Ribera. ""And what we have seen is that everybody has supported the package, no single country has decided to step down. ""It is very difficult. It is like organising a party for 200 friends, and there's a single menu that everybody has to eat. It is not so easy but we have got it. That's fantastic!"" While negotiators have been congratulating themselves on a job well done in landing the rulebook, there are many voices here who feel that the agreement does not go far enough. They point to the strength of the science, and the public recognition of the impacts of climate change seen this year in heatwaves and wildfires. 2019 10 warmest years 10 coldest years 20th Century average Hotter Colder Source: NOAA Many environmental campaigners believe that Katowice was a missed opportunity for radical action. ""We have ended up here with more of a coal trade fair than a climate convention,"" said Mohamed Adow from Christian Aid, referring to the efforts to promote coal by Poland and the US at this conference. ""We haven't acted in good faith, particularly for the young, that we takes seriously what science is telling us and we are responding to it. That message didn't come through. ""If people think the rulebook is the way to get the world on that path, it is not robust or ambitious enough."" One of the most striking things about this conference of the parties was the presence of energised young people in far greater numbers than I have ever seen them at a COP before. Climate change chimes with young people in a way that is sometimes missing with older people, who make up the bulk of negotiators here. The sense that perhaps this UN process doesn't quite connect with the modern world was summed up best by Mohamed Nasheed, the former president of the Maldives and now their lead climate negotiator. ""Almost 10 years since I was last at these climate negotiations, I must say, nothing much seems to have changed. ""We are still using the same old, dinosaur language. Still saying the same old words. ""Still making the same tedious points.""

" By Jessica Lussenhop Hesperia, California, is a dusty city of fewer than 100,000 people in the Mojave Desert, about a two-hour drive northeast of downtown Los Angeles. Far from the glitz of Hollywood, it’s a city of squat houses with high chain-link fences surrounding dirt yards. The purple snow-capped San Bernardino mountains loom on almost every horizon. On the week I visited, a big white tent was selling freshly cut Christmas trees in a vacant lot between a Chevron station and a Wendy’s fast-food restaurant. The smell of pine sap hovered over the arid plateau. I’d come to the High Desert because it’s the home of one of the internet’s most recent - and most reviled - viral stars: Jered Threatin, a hard rock musician who performs simply under the name “Threatin”. A month earlier, Threatin had become an international laughing stock, after a small army of internet sleuths revealed that he had tried to fake his way to stardom using paid Facebook likes, YouTube views and bots. He had uploaded deceptively edited film footage that appeared to show him playing to sold-out crowds, lied about a non-existent award and album sales, completely fabricated an entire US tour, and used it all to secure a 10-city tour of Europe and the UK. As it would turn out, that was all just the tip of the iceberg. By the end of it, his bandmates had abandoned him, his final stops in France, Italy and Germany were cancelled, and the internet was in a frenzy over the young man’s downfall. “The guy’s clearly a delusional rich kid,” scolded a commenter on one of the dozens of articles that helped unravel the hoax. “A simple conman,” read another. “I'm surprised he hasn't gotten the hell kicked out of him yet. I'll do it for free.” His own brother, Scott, an extreme metal musician still living back in their hometown of Moberly, Missouri, had warned me not to bother coming to California to speak to his now-infamous younger sibling. “It's all smoke and mirrors with Jered,” he wrote to me via Facebook. “He'll lead you to believe there’s something big to get you to bite... only for you to be let down. Be careful.” Scott went as far as to wonder if Jered might rent out some kind of party mansion in anticipation of my arrival, to convince me that he really was an international rock star. But my GPS instructions led me to an ordinary-looking, single-storey house on the side of a thunderous four-lane freeway lined with fast-food restaurants and superstores. When I rang the doorbell, a woman with long reddish-blonde hair and librarian’s glasses answered the door. It was Kelsey, Jered’s wife. I recognised her from her Instagram account, which had briefly gone dark as the internet mob descended upon her, demanding to know her level of complicity in her husband’s scam. Threatin - whose real name is Jered Eames - stepped into the hallway behind her. The 29-year-old was shorter than I expected, about 5ft 9in (1.75m), wearing the same black leather motorcycle jacket he wore in his promotional photos over a black T-shirt and black trousers. He has one of those ageless faces that would make you believe he was either 19 or 50, depending on what you were being told. His distinctive hair cascaded down his back. “Nice to meet you,” he said, extending a pale hand. “I’m Jered. But you know that.” As we briefly toured the Eames’ immaculate and sparsely decorated home - framed portraits of Jered hung throughout, rows of identical black T-shirts and cargo pants hung in the walk-in wardrobe - I still didn’t know what to expect. Would he be defensive? Apologetic? Was he embarrassed or oblivious? Over the many hours of conversation that followed, I discovered that he was none of these things. Even all the cunning of internet detectives hadn’t been able to fully uncover the truth behind Jered Threatin, and the strange and sparklingly unique trainwreck that was the Breaking the World Tour. When I told him point blank that there was no way I could completely trust what he was telling me, he was unperturbed. “I understand that,” he shrugged. “That’s part of the fascination.” Weeks earlier, when the immolation of Threatin was in full effect, even the people he had tricked into supporting his disastrous bid for fame had to give him credit - the attempt was impressive in both its intricacy and its audacity. “This whole thing is just surreal,” said Rob Moore, lead singer of the band Dogsflesh, which opened for Threatin on one of the early tour stops. “He’s basically duped the whole of the music industry. He’s duped everybody, myself included.” Months before Threatin boarded a plane bound for Heathrow, London, material sent out to venues and prospective support bands claimed that Eames had “signed to SPV Records (Whitesnake, Scorpions, Motorhead)” and that his “last single charted Top 40 in 7 countries”. “The world rarely sees so much talent wrapped into one person,” read his website, alongside photos of a wan young man with long, straw-coloured hair glowering into the camera. The site reported sales of more than 55,000 copies of his debut EP. His Facebook page had nearly 40,000 likes and his YouTube channel was filled with clips of Threatin playing to packed arenas of screaming fans. “I would let Jered Threatin do literally ANYTHING to me!” one of dozens of fan comments gushed. It was this kind of online fandom that helped convince guitarist Joe Prunera that playing with Threatin might be the kind of break he’d been waiting for. It began with a Facebook friend request from someone named Lisa Golding. Prunera, a 36-year-old AV technician at the Wynn Las Vegas resort and casino, had moved out West years earlier with aspirations of a career in music, and noticed immediately that Golding was an agent with a company called Aligned Artist Management based in Beverly Hills. As soon as he approved her request, Golding sent Prunera a message. “We have a signed hard rock artist on our roster that is looking for a new rhythm guitarist for their upcoming tour in Europe this November,” Golding wrote. “If you are interested I would like to set you up with an audition/meeting with the band in Los Angeles.” Prunera immediately called the number at the bottom of the message, spoke to Golding, and agreed to make the four-hour drive for the audition. A second employee of Aligned Artist Management named Joe Abrams took care of the logistics via email, writing that while the tour would pay only $300 (£239) in total, all Prunera’s expenses would be covered for the two-week itinerary. On 21 July, Prunera arrived on the Sunset Boulevard location of SIR Studios. When he texted Golding to tell her he’d arrived, it was Kelsey who met him and walked him back to the rehearsal studio where Jered was waiting. “He was very down to earth, very nice and easy to get along with,” recalled Prunera. “My initial thought was this is someone I could actually see myself hanging out with.” At dinner that night, Eames offered Prunera the job. For someone who’d put some of his own rock star dreams on the back burner to make ends meet, it felt like a great opportunity. The fact that he’d never heard of Threatin didn’t bother him. “I was thinking: ‘OK, he’s a signed artist, he’s got a label behind him, a manager, a promoter.’ I’m thinking that he’s not huge, but he’s on his way,” said Prunera. Threatin also hired bassist Gavin Carney, a local from outside LA, and Dane Davis, a drummer based in Las Vegas. All three were approached by Golding and Abrams, who’d found their videos on YouTube. None of the band members ever met anyone from Aligned in person, but were nevertheless excited by the opportunity, and the prospect that if Threatin took off, it could become a regular, paying gig. The quartet started practising in Hesperia every other weekend from July until October, then the Eameses put them up in the guest bedrooms and on their living room sofa for a full week before departure. The band practised non-stop until it was time to leave for the airport in Los Angeles. “It was exciting, it was cool,” recalled Carney, a 24-year-old car mechanic, who hadn’t travelled much outside of California before. “My first tour ever, we’re going to Europe and the UK - that’s pretty crazy.” At the time, the only thing that struck any of the three hired band members as odd was a surprise announcement that their promised $300 fee was now actually their food budget. Davis says he was upset, knowing that $300 would hardly last a week in an expensive city like London. (Eames disputed this account, saying the band members always knew the money was for per diem.) “But I’m the kind of person where I’ve given my word that I’m going on this tour, and my word means something to me,” he said. “I didn’t want it to end up screwing over the band.” After two days of London sightseeing in the hired Mercedes-Benz Sprinter van driven by Kelsey, the band arrived for the first show of the tour at The Underworld in Camden. While the band was backstage taking giddy pre-show selfies, Jon Vyner, The Underworld’s booking manager, was expecting a fairly sizeable crowd for a Thursday night. The gig had been arranged a month earlier by Threatin’s booking agent, Casey Marshall, from an LA-based company called StageRight Bookings. Marshall had paid the venue’s £780 ($979) hire fee and informed Vyner via email that they’d pre-sold 291 tickets for the evening. That would have packed the venue to well over half its capacity, and Vyner had staffed the doors and bar accordingly. “We would have been overjoyed if that many people actually turned up,” he said. Marshall had also arranged for two support bands to play, and when Prunera and Davis slipped into the audience to check them out, both noticed there were only a handful of spectators. “I kind of thought to myself: ‘Maybe this is a band that’s not really that popular and they’re kind of just starting out,’” recalled Davis. But by the time Threatin took to the stage for their first real performance together, the audience had actually dwindled further. Prunera, who’d simply assumed that Threatin’s fan base in the UK must be massive, was disappointed, but tried to put it out of his mind. “I thought: ‘Who knows, it’s a Thursday night, maybe nobody’s out, people gotta work tomorrow,’” he said. “We weren’t stressing out because these things can happen.” Behind the scenes, however, Vyner was “quite angry”. “I told Casey by email never to contact us again,” he said. Oblivious to the trouble brewing, the band moved on to the next stop at Trillians in Newcastle upon Tyne. Marshall had hired Rob Moore’s Dogsflesh as the opener. As a seasoned musician touring since 1982, Moore took the time to check Threatin out before accepting the show offer, and was pleased with what he saw. “Loads and loads of hits and views and likes and comments. We thought: ‘Yeah, this guy’s obviously the real thing,’” he said. “We thought if we can get on with their booking agent in America, maybe they can open up a few more doors for us.” Once again, however, as the support band came on, the venue was nearly empty. After Threatin failed to acknowledge the members of Dogsflesh after their set - a backstage faux pas - Moore decided to pack up and leave without staying to watch the headliner. As he walked out, Moore says he saw five people in the audience, two of whom were members of his own band. Things finally boiled over at the band’s fourth gig, The Exchange in Bristol, where Marshall had told the venue to expect 180 pre-sold ticket holders. Billy Jon Bingham, frontman for the band Ghost of Machines, says his band took the Bristol gig unpaid as an opportunity for more exposure and a chance to sell merchandise. But he arrived to see that there was no queue and the Hollywood promoter was nowhere to be found. Ten minutes before they were due to take the stage, a manager at The Exchange waved him over. “He pulled me aside and said: ‘They haven’t sold any tickets. I’ve asked him to cough up the money that we’ve lost or we’re losing on the bar, otherwise they’re gonna close the venue,’” he recalled. Bingham says he saw Eames, who up until this point had been slinking around the venue with his hood up, go to a cash point and withdraw the £400 needed for the show to go on. Bartender Jonathan Minto, who had come in to help handle the expected crowd, overheard his manager quibbling with Eames over the additional cost. But Minto said that at the time he believed they’d all been “taken for a ride by a shady promoter”. That evening, Threatin took the stage to an audience of absolutely no-one. “My initial reaction was to feel sorry for him and the band, because having no-one turn up at your show is pretty demoralising,” wrote Minto in a message to the BBC. “But then… during his set, we started the internet sleuthing.” Minto said that when he and the other idle bartenders watched the clip that appeared to show Threatin playing to a sold-out crowd in an arena somewhere, they saw that Eames never appeared in the same shot as the throngs of fans in the pit. “He had literally just spliced footage of a crowd of at least 20,000 people rocking out at a real gig with close-up footage of Jered playing in front of wall,” said Minto. The next morning, he posted a long Facebook message, laying out everything he’d found out the previous night, thinking his friends in the music industry would get a kick out of it. “Threaten [sic] is essentially a fake band. 38,000 likes on Facebook which have ALL been paid for,” he wrote. “The 100 or so people attending the event page (and all the other event pages for their tour) are all based in Brazil. Every comment on their youtube videos is phoney.” The post began to spread. After reading it, Tim Williams, editor-in-chief of the blog Sick Chirpse in London, went on the websites of the companies that allegedly represented Threatin: Aligned Artist Management, StageRight Bookings, Magnified Media PR and his label, Superlative Music Recordings. “It looked like it was made by a kid in 10 minutes,” said Williams of the websites. “It was very suspicious.” When Williams googled the other bands allegedly signed with Superlative, nothing came up. All four websites were registered to the same anonymous GoDaddy account. On 9 November - a little over a week into the tour - Sick Chirpse,MetalSucksand NME all posted the first articles exposing what Williams called “the bizarre story of Jered Threatin”. Minto said he and other workers at The Exchange had also been contacting the venues further along the tour route to warn them not to believe anything that Threatin’s management was telling them. He says his phone began going crazy with notifications. “People were really digging into who he was and finding out crazy information nearly every minute,” he said. A mountain of damning evidence began piling up. The news outlet that had awarded Threatin “Rock Artist of the Year” in 2017? Fake. The profile photo of Lisa Golding from her Facebook page? Lifted from a Montreal photographer’s website. The physical address for StageRight Bookings in Los Angeles actually belonged to a suicide prevention charity. By the time the band arrived for its fifth gig in Birmingham, Carney could tell something was up. “It just didn’t feel like we were welcome,” he said. Cracks began to form within the band as soon as they disembarked from the ferry in Northern Ireland. Davis switched his mobile phone back on to find that his inbox was full of emails from concerned friends as well as derisive internet trolls, haranguing him for his role in the “fake band”. As he read the story in NME, Davis became alarmed that he “had no idea who Jered is, or what he’s capable of”. While Kelsey and Jered were checking in to the home they had rented for the band, Davis showed Prunera and Carney one of the links that had been sent to him. “At that point I just told them: ‘Let’s keep quiet and just try to find out as much as possible and get a game plan together,’” he said. “From then on we communicated through text.” An awkward scene unfolded that evening in the living room, with all three hired bandmates furiously texting back and forth to one another, while trying to play it cool with Jered and Kelsey sitting just feet away. “I get online and sure enough, it’s everywhere. It’s all over the internet,” said Prunera. “I’m like: ‘What is going on?’” Davis’ mother had flown from Las Vegas to Belfast to see her son play, but instead, he conscripted her to help the band gather their luggage and flee the rented house without a confrontation with Jered. But before that could happen, Jered came downstairs and asked if anyone else had been getting any weird emails. “Jered seemed like he was just as confused,’” recalled Prunera. “He said he was a victim. We said: ‘Dude this is over.’” Davis left that night with his family. Prunera followed the next morning, checking into a hotel and ultimately relying on an aunt to fund his trip back home. Only Carney, who felt unsure about what he was reading versus what Jered was saying, agreed to stay. But without a drummer or the other guitarist, the Breaking the World tour officially broke down. By then, the story had gone fully viral. MetalSucks filed a dozen follow-up stories, breathlessly chronicling the band’s every blunder. Threatin became the talk of music podcasts and YouTube channels. The New York Times called it “a most puzzling hoax even for 2018”. When journalists discovered that Jered Threatin’s real name was Jered Eames, it didn’t take long to track down his older brother, Scott, to their hometown of Moberly, Missouri. He seemed unsurprised by his younger brother’s antics. “I caught an article pretty early on, and once I saw the picture on there I kind of rolled my eyes,” he said. “I was hoping it would blow over.” Credit: Tom Couture Scott, who plays guitar for the extreme metal band NEVALRA and under the stage name Wicked One for the black metal band Thy Antichrist, said he hasn’t spoken to his brother in about six years - since Jered and Kelsey packed up and abruptly moved to California in 2012. According to Scott, the rift began over the extreme metal group, Saetith, Scott and Jered formed together, an outfit that in Scott’s estimation had real promise and had started building a reputation. They even travelled to Puerto Rico together on a 2011 tour. But things soured when Scott went online and saw that Jered had changed the band’s Facebook page to show that he - not Scott - had played guitar on their upcoming recordings. “He was my best friend, honestly. I was pretty isolated,” says Scott. “Almost overnight it went from best friend to not speaking.” He says he still hopes that someday his wayward sibling will come home, for their parents’ sake. “He’s still my brother,” he said. Back in Europe, Carney went sightseeing with the Eames. They toured an Irish castle, and visited the Eiffel Tower in Paris. Carney says it was fun. The epic disintegration of the tour was discussed only shallowly, and Carney did not confront Jered. But the final straw came when Jered released what was up until this point his first and only statement on the debacle. It was just three sentences long: “What is Fake News? I turned an empty room into an international headline. If you are reading this, you are part of the illusion.” The internet collectively groaned. But for Carney’s mother, it was a sign that the whole thing had gone too far - she insisted Carney let her fly him back home to Los Angeles. He acquiesced. But Carney seemed to be the last person still willing to believe that Threatin’s management existed, or that the whole tour hadn’t simply fallen victim to an unscrupulous promoter. Not long after returning, he even posted a video of himself covering his “favourite” Threatin songs on YouTube. “There’s still a lot of questions. I don’t really want to come to any conclusions until I know,” he told me at the time. “I want to hear what he has to say.” By the time I’d heard about the saga, Eames seemed to be in the defensive crouch familiar to anyone who’s watched a viral internet-shaming unfold - his Twitter and Instagram accounts had been made private. A series of YouTube interviews with him (which turned out to be Eames interviewing himself) had disappeared from the web. Yet at the same time, his critics were finding themselves blocked from his Facebook page, a sign that from somewhere on the cancelled tour route, the wounded frontman was watching. During this time, he was also ignoring all requests for interviews from journalists. I sent him a direct message on Twitter anyway, not expecting to hear back. He responded within hours. “I'll be back in LA next week.” About two weeks after he’d returned home, Jered Eames sat at his dining room table drinking a Coke and scrolling through the reams of vitriol that come up when you plug “Threatin” into Facebook’s search bar. Kelsey sat beside him as one of their four cats swished around the couple’s feet. “Threatin is a total fraud,” Jered read aloud, a slight Missouri twang still discernible in his voice. “We stupidly hired our venue out to his agent Casey Marshall based in America - I assume Casey is Threatin’s mother.” He read further silently. “They think my parents paid for the whole thing, that’s hilarious,” he said. Jered moved out of his parents’ house and into a house with Kelsey when the two were still in high school. He claims the tour was funded with the money they squirrelled away when he was flipping burgers at a Moberly Burger King and installing court-mandated breathalyser devices in people’s cars. Neither of them is in touch with their families back in the Midwest. “I’m very much a loner,” said Jered. “Not only do I not want friends, I don’t want family either.” He admits that friction within his family did precipitate his cutting off contact with Scott and his parents, but he says that what really sent him to California was a sudden, violent coughing fit that landed him bent over the sink, choking out blood. Without going to a doctor, he said, he simply assumed he was dying and decided to make some dramatic decisions. “I just went: ‘Am I really happy doing what I’m doing with my life?’ And I went: ‘No, I’m not. I’m gonna move to Los Angeles.’ Everything I thought about doing, I’m doing right now.” The Eames live a very small life together. They say they do not socialise with anyone but each other. They rarely go out, and when they do, it’s to drive around and talk. The fact that the single motivating factor in Jered’s life is an insatiable need for fame, yet he has no friends, is a paradox he acknowledges, but has no explanation for. Tapping away on his laptop, Jered tried - and repeatedly failed - to log in to one of the hundreds of fake Facebook profiles he’d started over the past year, since the launch of the album he’d written and recorded, playing all the instruments himself, in the huge studio space on the east side of the house. Although he made a few unsuccessful attempts to promote Breaking the World through traditional means, he quickly decided to go a different route. “Why do I need some gatekeeper to tell me that it’s what they want it to be, or it’s good enough for them?” he remembered thinking. “I’m going to find my own way to do things.” Earlier in our meeting, he’d reached under his bed and fished out five notebooks. He flipped one open on a random page and showed me that line after line was filled in with email addresses, their passwords, and a little lock symbol to denote that they’d been locked down or flagged as spam, and were now defunct. In the early days, these accounts had been used in the comment sections of YouTube and on Facebook to sing Threatin’s praises. He kept the names of his fake Facebook accounts in an app on his phone as well: Mark Jaime. Sarina Goodman. Laura Wales. Ann Corbi. Casey Johnston. Jessica Rice. Josephine Gossan. James Grundy. Alicia Tanlor. Jered had also gone through the house pulling burner phones out of various drawers, all of which he said were used as a means to create the fake accounts, which require a unique phone number. “There should be more,” Kelsey had muttered as she looked down at a pile of eight phones. In my conversation with the couple, they quickly admitted the hoax. Indeed, all the likes and the views and the comments were paid for, made by bots or Jered himself. Casey Marshall, Joe Abrams, and Lisa Golding were also all Jered (Kelsey had provided Golding’s voice over the phone). None of the companies tied to Threatin really existed. He created the label first, to release his debut album online in August of 2017, and the universe of phoney companies and contacts had expanded from there. When he tried to generate press, he invented a publicist. When he needed to book some gigs, he created a booking agent. He viewed the entire ecosystem of the music industry - the managers, booking agents, promoters, even photographers and videographers - as just a series of roles he can fill himself. “If a band approaches a venue and says: ‘Hey, we wanna play this venue,’ you’re going to get ignored,” he says. “All it has to do is look like it’s coming from a booking agency - doesn’t even matter what booking agency, even a fake one - and then you’ll get talked to and you can get things booked. Simple as that.” As he explained his tactics, Jered was relaxed, confident - not the slightest bit embarrassed. But that’s because he had something he was eager to show me - a series of emails that he said he sent out under yet another alias, a Gmail account belonging to “E. Evieknowsit”. “URGENT: News tip,” the subject line read. “The musician going by the name Threatin is a total fake. He faked a record label, booking agent, facebook likes, and an online fanbase to book a European tour. ZERO people are coming to the shows and it is clear that his entire operation is fake,” he wrote, including links to all his phoney websites. “Please don’t let this man fake his way to fame... Please Expose him.” The first such message he showed me was dated 2 November, a day into the Breaking the World Tour, and a week before the first news reports were published. He says he sent the messages out to a database of reporters’ emails he keeps in a massive Excel spreadsheet on his laptop - to outlets like the Huffington Post, Spin, Consequence of Sound, Rolling Stone, The Guardian, Pitchfork, New York Times, MetalSucks and, yes, the BBC. Although it was unclear if the tips directly resulted in coverage, some of the emails appear to have predated articles. During the tour, when the bandmates weren’t looking or in another room, Eames claimed he was on his phone on Facebook under his various aliases, stoking the controversy. If he is to be believed, the public shaming of Jered Threatin was nothing but a carefully orchestrated publicity stunt. He’d even had Kelsey at the ready with a video camera, in the hope that someone at one of the venues might try to fight him and create a viral video to boot. “I manufactured my own destruction,” he said proudly. “My idea was, how am I going to fill these empty rooms? I’m going to fill them with eyes from the digital world. That was the objective from the beginning.” Were the things I’d taken as signs of humiliation - the closing of his social media accounts, the disappearance of the obviously fake YouTube interviews - actually Jered herding eyeballs towards his music, which he left up? As of writing, Threatin’s single Living is Dying has been viewed more than 1.2 million times. Ignoring interview requests was another form of stoking the fire. “As soon as the questions are answered, the story’s less interesting,” he said. Which brought us to the awkward fact of my sitting in his house, listening to his explanation. Maybe by writing the very story you are now reading,I’ve played a part in carrying out Jered Threatin’s master plan. Jered claims to be in meetings day after day with movie producers looking to fictionalise the saga, bookers who want him out on the road to capitalise on his notoriety, and music producers and labels who want to talk about his next album. Kelsey has hours of footage, from the auditions at SIR Studios all the way through the tour, which they intend to use in a documentary. She even taped him sending out news tips about his own fraudulence from their hotel in Newcastle. “There is no villain character anymore in rock music, or really in all music,” he says smugly. “I’m trying to vilify myself.” When I press him to find out if he feels bad about deceiving anyone - especially his former bandmates - he is unrepentant, and claims he offered to pay for them to fly home after the tour fell apart. “The job is the same either way, and the only difference is the number of people standing in front of you,” he said. “When they [the band] are saying: ‘I want to be a touring musician, I want to be famous and I want this and that’ - that’s what [they] got.” Although Eames provided emails, receipts, videos and other documentation to back up his story, ultimately it is still possible that the tale he laid out is not true. Perhaps the “E. Evieknowsit” messages were backdated. He didn’t allow me to take photos of the inside of his notebooks, because some of those accounts are still active, roving the internet, and a part of what he said are forthcoming publicity stunts. For his part, brother Scott was utterly unconvinced when I relayed Jered’s version of events. “He’s a master manipulator,” said Scott. “I want to be the voice of reason here. This is like every other profession and you’ve lied to everyone in your profession, so I don’t know where he’s going with this. He can be the internet sensation if he wants, but he’s not going be the musician that he wants to be.” In our last conversation, however, Jered dismissed the idea instantly that the music might not be good enough to carry him forward. “I came home to literally thousands and thousands of CD sales. I have a cult following,” he said. His only regret, he said, is that he didn’t show up to one of the cancelled shows, where his internet infamy would have generated a proper audience - perhaps the final stop in Italy. He would have liked to have gone on stage, faced the crowd, and refused to play a note. “I just would have gotten booed off stage, or bottled, and it would have been a beautiful piece of stage art,” he said wistfully. “It’s like, I show up and I play for no-one. And then when there’s an audience, I don’t play for anyone.” When I left the Eames’ home, I drove back to my hotel, where I was meeting the last person on earth who seemed to still believe in Threatin - former bassist Gavin Carney. He’d driven up with his father to answer my questions from another town outside LA. He had worn a suit and a floral print tie for the occasion, and seemed especially young in the moment, standing in the hotel lobby next to his father. I told him that only a short while ago, Jered had confirmed that the whole debacle - including the fake management companies and labels, the empty venues, the crush of media attention - had all been orchestrated. Sitting on a couch in the hotel suite, he looked crushed. “Wow,” he said. “It’s crazy. It’s amazing, if that’s the case, the amount of lies he was able to keep track of and be able to consistently repeat. It’s... it’s very shocking.” I repeated what Jered had said to me - that neither he, nor Prunera nor Davis would have got as famous if Threatin hadn’t turned into a three-ring circus. Carney agreed that in his case, Jered was essentially right. “I’ve been approached. I don’t mean to name drop, but, by a lot of people who are sort of high up,” he said. “I did get on the news. I’m here talking to you right now.” He thought for a moment. “Personally I wouldn’t want to do anything like that. I prefer to be kind of a goody two-shoes,” he said. “I put videos up, I try to put myself out there as honestly as I can and hopefully find somebody who wants to work with me. That’s the way I prefer to do it.” Of the three band members, Carney was the only one that Jered said he would like to play with again. But he acknowledged that Carney would probably never agree to it. In our entire conversation, it was the only time I thought Eames sounded unsure of himself. When I asked Carney if he could ever be friends with Jered, he said he didn’t know. “It’s hard for me to say now. It’s hard to know what is true and what isn’t.” Update: 19 December 2018 “The publicity stunt for this is done,” Jered Eames assured me at the end of our interview. “Anything I’ve said to you is factual.” To prove that he was indeed the one that tipped off the media to the hoax Eames forwarded me 16 different news tips sent from the “E. Evieknowsit” account. Four of them were sent to two different general BBC news tip email addresses, and the earliest of those was dated 4 November - five days before the first stories broke. My colleagues looked for the emails, but because those inboxes are routinely purged, they had nothing. After we first published our story, I began reaching out to reporters at the other outlets who had allegedly been sent emails. The earliest one was reportedly sent on 2 November to the “tips” inbox for the entertainment magazine Variety. “Yes, we got this email,” a helpful Variety reporter wrote back, attaching a copy with the exact same text that Jered had shared with me. Then I looked closer. The timestamp on Jered’s copy said it was sent on “Fri, Nov 2, 2018 at 12:16 PM”. The copy from the Variety reporter read, “Sat, Nov 17, 2018 at 4:32 PM”. An editor at MetalSucks, which did some of the earliest breaking stories on Threatin, could not find an alleged 7 November email that Jered shared with me. Instead, he found a different email from Evie in their inbox, pointing him to a YouTube clip from one of Threatin’s empty shows. It was dated 17 November. As I went down the line, I found that the New York Times, Ultimate Classic Rock and Metal Insider all got the “E. Evieknowsit” email on 17 November. But by this date, these outlets had already extensively covered the Threatin story. Finally, the BBC’s IT specialists managed to recover two deleted messages from “E. Evieknowsit”. Both were sent on 17 November, less than an hour apart.When I texted Jered to tell him what I’d found, he said he would respond. He never did. Built with Shorthand",Positive,0.9998142
