"The women say the ""rigid"" system has left them unable to make ends meet (illustrated by models) Four working single mothers have won a High Court challenge over the government's universal credit scheme. They argued a ""fundamental problem"" with the system meant their monthly payments varied ""enormously"", leaving them out of pocket and struggling financially. Lawyers for the women said the problem was likely to affect ""tens of thousands of people"" claiming the benefit. A DWP spokesman said: ""We are carefully considering the court's judgement."" It comes as Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd announceda raft of changes to the government's flagship scheme. She also confirmed she would delay asking Parliament to authorise the transfer of three million people on to universal credit until next year, after a pilot of the transfer from existing benefits has been completed. Universal credit is a means-tested benefit, rolling six separate benefits into one payment. It has proved controversial almost from its inception, with reports of IT issues, massive overspends, administrative problems and delays to the scheme's rollout. What is universal credit? Universal Credit: Will benefit changes affect you? On Friday, it was announced that Danielle Johnson, Claire Woods, Erin Barrett and Katie Stewart had succeeded in a judicial review action against the government over the method used to calculate payments. It followed a hearing in November when the court was told the women were struggling financially,with some falling into debt or relying on food banks. Tessa Gregory, a solicitor from law firm Leigh Day, who represented part-time dinner lady Danielle Johnson from Keighley, West Yorkshire, said her client was ""a hard-working single mum"" and ""precisely the kind of person universal credit was supposed to help"". But Ms Gregory said the ""rigid income assessment system"" had left her Â£500 out of pocket over the year and spiralling into debt. Solicitor Carla Clarke, of the Child Poverty Action Group, which also brought the case on behalf of the mothers, said the universal credit system was ""out of step with both actual reality and the law"", and had caused them ""untold hardship, stress and misery"". This video can not be played Universal credit: Is the government's benefit system working? When calculating universal credit, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) sets assessment periods for each person to look at how much they earn - from the 1st of the month to the end of the month, for example. But lawyers for the mothers said a problem arises when claimants are paid by employers on a date which ""clashes"" with their assessment period. For example, they pointed out that if a claimant is paid early because of a weekend or bank holiday, the system counts them as having been paid twice in one month and they receive a ""vastly reduced"" universal credit payment. By Michael Buchanan, BBC social affairs correspondent This is an important and potentially hugely expensive decision. The barrister for the DWP told the High Court in November that if they lost the case it would cost them hundreds of millions of pounds to change the system. Leaked documents that I saw in October showed officials discussing the problem but concluding that ""there is nothing we can do to mitigate this issue"". At the heart of the problem is a design fault with universal credit that cuts the entitlement of tens of thousands of claimants each month, sometimes by hundreds of pounds. The court's decision was published just minutes before Amber Rudd started her speech today, billed as a reset of the beleaguered benefit. She didn't mention this particular problem, but it highlights that Ms Rudd's remarks can only be the starting point in dealing with Universal Credit's ongoing problems. Universal credit merges six older benefits into one new one, and is being introduced gradually across the UK. Instead of applying for lots of different payments, for different things, one payment is calculated based on all of someone's circumstances, like: â¢             being unemployed â¢             working on a low income â¢             needing help with housing costs â¢             having children â¢             having an illness or disability It can be claimed by people both in and out of work. How much someone in work claiming universal credit receives each month is based on how much they earned in the previous month. And unlike with some old benefits, there's no limit to the hours someone can work per week and still claim. But as they earn more, their benefit payment reduces gradually. This is designed to mean ""work always pays"" - that is, in theory someone never loses more in benefits than they have gained through taking extra hours of work. Some households will receive less money from universal credit than they would have done under the old system, while others will receive more. This is partly down to the intentional design of the system and partly a side-effect of cuts that have been made as the benefit was introduced. The two judges in London concluded the work and pensions secretary had ""wrongly interpreted"" the relevant regulations. Ms Gregory called for Ms Rudd to take ""immediate steps to ensure that no other claimants are adversely affected"" and ""ensure all those who have suffered because of this unlawful conduct are swiftly and fairly compensated"". The leader of the trade union Unison, Dave Prentis, also called for the government to ""compensate those who have lost out substantially"". Shadow work and pensions secretary Margaret Greenwood said the High Court's ruling ""confirms once again that universal credit is failing people on low pay"", and called for a stop to the rollout. Rebecca Smidmore told the BBC she felt ""made to feel bad"" for claiming benefits Rebecca Smidmore, a carer for her 10-year-old son who has spina bifida, said her family's universal credit payments vary hugely each month - for example, if her husband gets paid a day or two early when payday falls at a weekend. ""They then think he's been paid twice in a month and universal credit is then altered,"" she said. ""So some months we get a really low amount, some months we get a really high amount."" She said universal credit had a ""massive impact really early on"" and makes budgeting difficult, adding: ""It's as if we are made to feel bad that we are claiming this benefit, that we don't deserve this money"". Meanwhile,speaking to the BBC's Newsnight's political editorNicholas Watt, Ms Rudd announced she favoured calls to change the way people who are on universal credit, but starting to go back to work, are taxed. Ms Rudd told the programme: ""I would like every incentive we can find to make sure that people going back into work realise that it is the best thing for them and that they don't get a huge 90% tax rate."" Earlier on Friday, Ms Rudd promised to make the universal credit system more ""individual"" and tailor it to claimants needs, for example by making payments more regular. Changeswill also see more money go directly to womenwho are the ""main carer"" in a family, in response to criticism that the ""one payment per household"" system penalised women. Charities have argued a whole family's benefit payments often go to the man's account and women, particularly victims of domestic violence, have little or no access to it. Ms Rudd also announced a U-turn on plans to extend a benefits cap on families with more than two children. The cap will no longer apply to about 15,000 families, who had their children before the two-child limit was introduced in 2017.

"More small energy suppliers are likely to go bust this winter, analysts say, leading to potential disruption and higher costs for customers. Economy Energy was the latest to collapse earlier this month, following customer complaints about service including delayed bills and refunds. It followed a string of similar collapses and analysts say five or 10 more could go as winter costs rise. If so, domestic customers' supply is protected but their tariff is not. When an energy company ceases trading its customers are automatically transferred to a new supplier. Any credit they have, because they have used less energy than they paid, is carried over. Regulator Ofgem has announced that Ovo Energy will take on Economy Energy's 235,000 customers. However, in cases of this kind, customers are given a new tariff with the new supplier that may be more expensive than their current deal. Householders are being urged to consider customer service scores as well as price when switching to a new supplier. In the past year, a number of small energy suppliers have gone bust, includingSpark Energy,Extra Energy,Future Energy, National Gas and Power, Iresa Energy, Gen4U, One Select, Usio Energy and most recentlyEconomy Energy. Many have struggled with dealing with customers' queries and complaints, leading to scrutiny from the Ofgem. According to Ellen Fraser, energy analyst at Baringa Partners, some simply ran out of cash. ""It is a very cash intensive market,"" she said, pointing out that energy is bought upfront with the money from customer bills coming in later. Some did not understand that dynamic."" She said that rising wholesale prices and higher winter costs could see up to 10 more suppliers collapse. At its peak there were more than 70 businesses vying for domestic customers. That has fallen to 60. Energy price cap comes into force Would you trust an auto-switching site for life? A few years ago, there were only a dozen or so, and some suppliers have come unstuck by offering deals that take them to the top of the ""best buy"" lists on price comparison websites. Ms Fraser said energy was a complex market, serving complex customers on different tariffs. Some businesses had tried to grow quickly, taking on thousands of customers, but had struggled with the logistics involved. Julie Palmer, of corporate recovery specialists Begbies Traynor, said there had been a clear rise in utility companies in ""significant financial distress"". ""We may well expect more competitors going to the wall in 2019,"" she said. Even energy minister Claire Perry was reported to have said much the same at a recent conference. Earlier this week, Mary Starks, from Ofgem, told the BBC that there was ""room for improvement"" in the licensing regime so businesses were properly vetted before they started competing for customers. Typically, the cap - introduced on 1 January - means that typical usage by a dual fuel customer paying by direct debit will cost no more than Â£1,137 a year. However, this only applies to default tariffs (also called standard variable tariffs), so is designed to protect those who have remained on the same deal for years, rather than those who have shopped around. Research by auto-switching service Look After My Bills suggests that there are 66 tariffs that are more expensive than the cap. They are mostly fixed deals, so are not subject to the cap. ""The price cap was a welcome step to protecting consumers on extortionate standard tariffs,"" said head of research Lily Green. ""Fixed deals are often seen as the sure fire way to get a good price. But locking people into a fixed deal hundreds of pounds pricier than the cap, with a hefty exit fee is a pretty shameless move by suppliers. ""With the complexities around tariffs and big changes to the industry, it is becoming harder and harder to know you're making the right choice as consumer."" That complexity will continue if, as expected, Ofgem raises the cap on default tariffs in England, Scotland and Wales in April. Northern Ireland has its own regulator and price cap. Andrew Long, founder of another automatic switching site - Switchcraft - said that the cap had already led to a clustering of prices. The difference between the cheapest and most expensive tariffs had fallen from about Â£300 a year to less than Â£200, he said. Some say this is an argument against the price cap, as it could reduce price competition, to the detriment of active customers. Automatic switching sites are likely to become more popular, but they are also expected to attract greater attention from the regulator. These services move customers automatically onto the best option when their fixed deal expires, but this is judged on price rather than customer service. At a time when suppliers are going bust, householders are being urged to consider customer service scores when choosing their gas and electricity provider.

"Daniel Kaye was hired to attack telecommunications company Lonestar A British cyber criminal who carried out an attack so powerful it knocked a nation offline has been jailed. Daniel Kaye admitted attacking an African phone company - inadvertently crashing Liberia's internet - in 2016. The 30-year-old remains at the heart of a major international investigation into hundreds of acts of cyber sabotage around the world. The National Crime Agency says Kaye is perhaps the most significant cyber criminal yet caught in the UK. Jailing Kaye for 32 months at Blackfriars Crown Court in London, Judge Alexander Milne QC said Kaye had committed a ""cynical"" financial crime. He added: ""Paradoxically, what is urged on your behalf is that you are an intelligent young man who knows what your powers can do. ""But that makes it all the more worrying that you used your abilities to carry out this attack."" Kaye wept as he was taken down. Kaye, from Egham in Surrey, is a self-taught hacker who began selling his considerable skills on the dark web - offering individuals opportunities to target and destroy their business rivals. According to court papers, Kaye was hired in 2015 to attack Lonestar, Liberia's leading mobile phone and internet company, by an individual working for Cellcom, its competitor. There is no suggestion that Cellcom knew what the employee was doing - but the individual offered Kaye up to $10,000 (Â£7,800) a month to use his skills to do as much as possible to destroy Lonestar's service and reputation. Robin Sellers, prosecuting, told Blackfriars Crown Court that in November 2016 Kaye had built a ""botnet"" - a particularly powerful form of cyber attack that is designed to overwhelm a target's systems, making it impossible to carry out normal business. This type of attack is known as a Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS). It is different to a ransom demand that locks up systems, such asthe ""Wannacry"" attack on the NHS. The weapon, known as ""Mirai #14"" worked by secretly hijacking a vast number of Chinese-made Dahua webcams, which are used for security in homes and businesses around the world. He identified that the cheap cameras and other similar equipment had a security flaw - and he exploited that to take over the devices without owners knowing. That meant he could turn them into what amounted to a ""zombie"" cyber army to attack his target. In November 2016, working secretly out of Cyprus and controlling the botnet via his mobile phone, Kaye ordered it to overwhelm Lonestar's systems. On his command, hundreds of thousands of the webcams began firing data requests at the west African company. The system began to struggle to manage the demands and parts of the infrastructure crashed. He then tried to pull in additional firepower by sending further attacks from Germany, where he had sought to hijack part of Deutsche Telekom's national infrastructure. Researchers found that at the peak of the attack, the Mirai #14 code had compromised about one million devices worldwide. In Liberia, mobile phone users began to see their devices go offline. The company called in cyber security consultants who attempted to repel the attack, but by that point it was too late because the botnet ran out of control. The National Crime Agency spearheaded the investigation Making the Mirai #14 botnet for use in a Computer Misuse Act 1990 offence Launching cyber attacks against Lonestar in Liberia - another crime under the Computer Misuse Act Possessing criminal property - relating to $10,000 found on him when he was arrested At the time, Liberia's internet was dependent on both a small number of providers and a relatively limited Atlantic cable. European nations, by comparison, have a vastly more secure internet because traffic can reach users through many different connection routes. Kaye had sent so much traffic at Lonestar, the entire national system jammed. According to investigators, the country's internet repeatedly failed between 3 November and 4 November 2016 - disrupting not just Lonestar but organisations and ordinary users up and down the state. This is believed to be the first time that a single cyber attacker had disrupted an entire nation's internet - albeit without intending to do so. Hack attacks cut internet access in Liberia In written submissions to the court, Babatunde Osho, Lonestar's former chief executive, said Kaye's criminality had been devastating. ""The DDOS perpetrated by Daniel Kaye seriously compromised Lonestar's ability to provide a reliable internet connection to its customers,"" said Mr Osho. ""In turn, Mr Kaye's actions prevented Lonestar's customers from communicating with each other, obtaining access to essential services and carrying out their day-to-day business activities. ""A substantial number of Lonestar's customers switched to competitors. ""In the years preceding the DDOS attacks, Lonestar's annual revenue exceeded $80m (Â£62.4m). Since the attacks, revenue has decreased by tens of millions and its current liabilities have increased by tens of millions."" Kaye was already suspected of being behind the attack  - and he was arrested when he returned to the UK on holiday in February 2017. He was carrying $10,000 which the National Crime Agency says was part of the payments he received for the Lonestar attack. Germany asked for Kaye to be extradited - and later that year he was convicted in a Cologne court of interfering with the Deutsche Telekom system. More than 124,000 Deutsche Telekom customers had seen their services crash - including Cologne's main sewage facility. The German authorities then extradited Kaye back to the UK to face the far more serious Liberia charges - because British law allows a cyber criminal to be prosecuted for an offence anywhere in the world. By this time time, National Crime Agency cyber specialists had also linked Kaye's Mirai #14 botnet to attacks against three British banks - Lloyds, Barclays and Halifax - in January 2017. The anonymous attacker had demanded payments to call off the attack. Daniel Kaye was previously convicted in a Cologne court of interfering with the Deutsche Telekom system Unlike Lonestar and Liberia, the sophisticated defences at all three British institutions repelled the onslaught. Kaye was initially charged with carrying out those attacks - but told prosecutors that while his botnet was behind the operation, he had loaned it to someone else via a dark web marketplace. At Blackfriars Crown Court on Friday, those allegations were formally dropped. Mike Hulett, head of the National Cyber Crimes Unit at the NCA, told the BBC that investigators were still trying to get to the bottom of the full scale of Kaye's criminality around the world. ""I regard Daniel Kaye as one of the most significant cyber criminals arrested in the UK,"" said Mr Hulett. ""He has a significant level of skill. The attacks that he carried out were not victimless."" Mr Hulett added that, to the NCA's knowledge, no cyber criminal had ever knocked an entire country off the internet through the force of one attack. At court, counsel for Kaye told the judge that the defendant did not accept the losses that Lonestar claimed to have suffered. Jonathan Green said that Liberia's internet was limited regardless of Kaye's attack. ""We say that a relatively slow internet service became slower. It is not accepted that this was a direct threat to Liberia."" He also told the court that Kaye had received interest from major technology firms who wanted to use his skills despite the criminality. ""We will need people like Mr Kaye on the side of the angels.""

"""With the greatest respect..."" Britons like to think they have a ""special relationship"" with the US, based on a common language and cultural, historical and political ties.

In the words of YouGov,external, ""half of Americans wouldn't be able to tell that a Briton is calling them an idiot"". YouGov showed a number of common British phrases, including ""with the greatest respect"", ""I'll bear it in mind"" and ""you must come for dinner"", to Britons and Americans. ""While not all the phrases show a difference in transatlantic understanding, there are some statements where many Yanks are in danger of missing the serious passive aggression we Brits employ,"" YouGov said.

"The women say the ""rigid"" system has left them unable to make ends meet (illustrated by models) Four working single mothers have won a High Court challenge over the government's universal credit scheme. They argued a ""fundamental problem"" with the system meant their monthly payments varied ""enormously"", leaving them out of pocket and struggling financially. Lawyers for the women said the problem was likely to affect ""tens of thousands of people"" claiming the benefit. A DWP spokesman said: ""We are carefully considering the court's judgement."" It comes as Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd announceda raft of changes to the government's flagship scheme. She also confirmed she would delay asking Parliament to authorise the transfer of three million people on to universal credit until next year, after a pilot of the transfer from existing benefits has been completed. Universal credit is a means-tested benefit, rolling six separate benefits into one payment. It has proved controversial almost from its inception, with reports of IT issues, massive overspends, administrative problems and delays to the scheme's rollout. What is universal credit? Universal Credit: Will benefit changes affect you? On Friday, it was announced that Danielle Johnson, Claire Woods, Erin Barrett and Katie Stewart had succeeded in a judicial review action against the government over the method used to calculate payments. It followed a hearing in November when the court was told the women were struggling financially,with some falling into debt or relying on food banks. Tessa Gregory, a solicitor from law firm Leigh Day, who represented part-time dinner lady Danielle Johnson from Keighley, West Yorkshire, said her client was ""a hard-working single mum"" and ""precisely the kind of person universal credit was supposed to help"". But Ms Gregory said the ""rigid income assessment system"" had left her Â£500 out of pocket over the year and spiralling into debt. Solicitor Carla Clarke, of the Child Poverty Action Group, which also brought the case on behalf of the mothers, said the universal credit system was ""out of step with both actual reality and the law"", and had caused them ""untold hardship, stress and misery"". This video can not be played Universal credit: Is the government's benefit system working? When calculating universal credit, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) sets assessment periods for each person to look at how much they earn - from the 1st of the month to the end of the month, for example. But lawyers for the mothers said a problem arises when claimants are paid by employers on a date which ""clashes"" with their assessment period. For example, they pointed out that if a claimant is paid early because of a weekend or bank holiday, the system counts them as having been paid twice in one month and they receive a ""vastly reduced"" universal credit payment. By Michael Buchanan, BBC social affairs correspondent This is an important and potentially hugely expensive decision. The barrister for the DWP told the High Court in November that if they lost the case it would cost them hundreds of millions of pounds to change the system. Leaked documents that I saw in October showed officials discussing the problem but concluding that ""there is nothing we can do to mitigate this issue"". At the heart of the problem is a design fault with universal credit that cuts the entitlement of tens of thousands of claimants each month, sometimes by hundreds of pounds. The court's decision was published just minutes before Amber Rudd started her speech today, billed as a reset of the beleaguered benefit. She didn't mention this particular problem, but it highlights that Ms Rudd's remarks can only be the starting point in dealing with Universal Credit's ongoing problems. Universal credit merges six older benefits into one new one, and is being introduced gradually across the UK. Instead of applying for lots of different payments, for different things, one payment is calculated based on all of someone's circumstances, like: â¢             being unemployed â¢             working on a low income â¢             needing help with housing costs â¢             having children â¢             having an illness or disability It can be claimed by people both in and out of work. How much someone in work claiming universal credit receives each month is based on how much they earned in the previous month. And unlike with some old benefits, there's no limit to the hours someone can work per week and still claim. But as they earn more, their benefit payment reduces gradually. This is designed to mean ""work always pays"" - that is, in theory someone never loses more in benefits than they have gained through taking extra hours of work. Some households will receive less money from universal credit than they would have done under the old system, while others will receive more. This is partly down to the intentional design of the system and partly a side-effect of cuts that have been made as the benefit was introduced. The two judges in London concluded the work and pensions secretary had ""wrongly interpreted"" the relevant regulations. Ms Gregory called for Ms Rudd to take ""immediate steps to ensure that no other claimants are adversely affected"" and ""ensure all those who have suffered because of this unlawful conduct are swiftly and fairly compensated"". The leader of the trade union Unison, Dave Prentis, also called for the government to ""compensate those who have lost out substantially"". Shadow work and pensions secretary Margaret Greenwood said the High Court's ruling ""confirms once again that universal credit is failing people on low pay"", and called for a stop to the rollout. Rebecca Smidmore told the BBC she felt ""made to feel bad"" for claiming benefits Rebecca Smidmore, a carer for her 10-year-old son who has spina bifida, said her family's universal credit payments vary hugely each month - for example, if her husband gets paid a day or two early when payday falls at a weekend. ""They then think he's been paid twice in a month and universal credit is then altered,"" she said. ""So some months we get a really low amount, some months we get a really high amount."" She said universal credit had a ""massive impact really early on"" and makes budgeting difficult, adding: ""It's as if we are made to feel bad that we are claiming this benefit, that we don't deserve this money"". Meanwhile,speaking to the BBC's Newsnight's political editorNicholas Watt, Ms Rudd announced she favoured calls to change the way people who are on universal credit, but starting to go back to work, are taxed. Ms Rudd told the programme: ""I would like every incentive we can find to make sure that people going back into work realise that it is the best thing for them and that they don't get a huge 90% tax rate."" Earlier on Friday, Ms Rudd promised to make the universal credit system more ""individual"" and tailor it to claimants needs, for example by making payments more regular. Changeswill also see more money go directly to womenwho are the ""main carer"" in a family, in response to criticism that the ""one payment per household"" system penalised women. Charities have argued a whole family's benefit payments often go to the man's account and women, particularly victims of domestic violence, have little or no access to it. Ms Rudd also announced a U-turn on plans to extend a benefits cap on families with more than two children. The cap will no longer apply to about 15,000 families, who had their children before the two-child limit was introduced in 2017.

"This video can not be played The #SaveRahaf campaign went viral after Rahaf started tweeting about her plight for asylum A Saudi woman who fled her family and became stranded at Bangkok's main airport is flying to Canada after being granted asylum status. Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun, 18, had been trying to reach Australia via Bangkok, but was initially told to return to Kuwait, where her family were waiting. She refused to fly back and barricaded herself into her airport hotel room, attracting international attention. She said she had renounced Islam, which is punishable by death in Saudi Arabia. The UN's refugee agency has said it considers her to be a legitimate refugee. Arrested for disobeying your father #SaveRahaf: How Twitter saved a Saudi woman Saudi women on what life's really like Refugee status is normally granted by governments, but the UNHCR can grant it where states are ""unable or unwilling to do so"",according to its website,external. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters: ""Canada has been unequivocal that we will always stand up for human rights and women's rights around the world. When the UN made a request of us that we grant Ms al-Qunun asylum, we accepted."" Canada has previously angered Saudi Arabia after calling for the release of detained women's rights activists in the country -prompting Riyadh to expel Canada's ambassadorand freeze all new trade. Why Trudeau won't back down The UNHCR has welcomed Canada's decision to resettle Ms Qunun. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, said: ""[Her] plight has captured the world's attention over the past few days, providing a glimpse into the precarious situation of millions of refugees worldwide. ""Refugee protection today is often under threat and cannot always be assured, but in this instance international refugee law and overriding values of humanity have prevailed."" She was on a trip to Kuwait with her family, when she fled on a flight to Bangkok. She said she intended to take a connecting flight to Australia - and had an Australian visa - but that her passport was seized by a Saudi diplomat when he met her coming off the flight at Suvarnabhumi airport, leaving her stranded. A Saudi envoy in Bangkok denied any official Saudi involvement in Ms Qunun's detention. Why Saudi Arabia matters to the West Saudi asylum seeker 'taken home' by family Saudi women to get divorce notice by text Thai officials initially described her case as a ""family problem"" and said she would be repatriated back to Kuwait the next day. However, Ms Qunun sent a series of tweets pleading for help from her airport hotel room, and her case was picked up by Human Rights Watch and journalists. A number of countries, including Australia, have considered her case for asylum. Analysis by Jonathan Head, BBC south east Asia correspondent Ms Qunun, seen here at a UN building before leaving Bangkok, is en route to Toronto via Seoul After days of speculation that she would move to Australia, Rahaf al-Qunun found herself on a flight in the opposite direction, to Canada. She was seen briefly, being escorted to the departure gate by UN officials. As her plane took off Police General Surachate Hakparn, the immigration chief whose change of heart on Monday allowed her temporary asylum in Thailand, told journalists she had left the country cheerful and grateful to those who looked after her here. Her father and brother, he said, who had come on what turned out to be a futile visit to try to persuade her to return to Saudi Arabia with them, would be leaving Thailand shortly after her. It is only two days since the Australian government announced that it had been approached to take Ms Qunun, and that it would treat her request sympathetically. The UN usually approaches only one country at a time to seek asylum. It is not clear why the Australian option fell through, and the UN switched to Canada. It might be that Australia's tough line towards refugees, and the insistence of its Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton that she would get no special treatment, threatened to slow down the processing of her application. The UN was concerned about her safety, following online threats to her life, and Canada may have been able to process her resettlement more quickly. Renunciation of Islam is punishable by death in Saudi Arabia. Under Saudi Arabia's ""male guardianship system"", a Saudi woman is required to obtain a male relative's approval to apply for a passport, travel outside the country, study abroad on a government scholarship, get married, leave prison, or even exit a shelter for abuse victims. Ms Qunun told the BBC: ""I shared my story and my pictures on social media and my father is so angry because I did this... I can't study and work in my country, so I want to be free and study and work as I want."" She also said she was afraid her family would kill her. Separately, she told AFP she had suffered physical and psychological abuse from her family, including being locked in her room for six months for cutting her hair. A spokesperson for her family told the BBC that they did not wish to comment and all they cared about was the young woman's safety. On Friday, Ms Qunun wrote on Twitter that she had ""some good news and some bad news"", before deleting her account. Her friends said she had received death threats online. Yes. Ms Qunun's case echoes that of another Saudi woman who was in transit to Australia in April 2017. Dina Ali Lasloom, 24, was en route from Kuwait via the Philippines but was taken back to Saudi Arabia from Manila airport by her family. She used a Canadian tourist's phone to send a message, a video of which was posted to Twitter, saying her family would kill her. Her fate on arriving back in Saudi Arabia remains unknown.

'Sara', a Saudi woman, spoke toBBC OS on the World Service on Wednesday Rahaf is an inspiration. But she's not the first one who did this and definitely not the last one. What we are going through is awful. We think about this every day because us women here do not know what it feels like to go out. We don't know what freedom tastes like. Dad keeps my passport with him all the time, we go to hotels and he puts it next to him when he sleeps. Unfortunately it's not a revolution. Every girl that is tweeting about this, it's either that she has already escaped or she's using a fake account like me. Some people tweeted me or DMed me to tell me to use my real account, for me to be brave. We do not want the guardianship any more. I want to go out of the house and drink coffee from Starbucks.

"Amber Rudd made her first major welfare speech on Friday Universal credit payments will go directly to a household's main carer in a move which is expected to help more women, Amber Rudd has announced. The work and pensions secretary alsoconfirmed she would delay asking MPsto allow the transfer of three million people on to the new system until 2020. And she scrapped plans to extend a two-child benefits cap to families with children born before 2017. Ms Rudd said she wanted universal credit to be compassionate and fair. Shadow work and pensions secretary Margaret Greenwood said: ""Universal credit is clearly failing and the government should stop the rollout now."" Amber Rudd's speech in London,came as four single mothers wona High Court challenge over the way payments are calculated. When asked about the court ruling, Ms Rudd said her department would be coming forward with a response. Reality Check: What's the problem with universal credit? Single mums win universal credit challenge Universal Credit: Will benefit changes affect you? Will the changes help you? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external By Michael Buchanan, BBC social affairs correspondent This speech was billed as a reset of universal credit, a clear acknowledgment from Amber Rudd that further tinkering with the troubled reform will no longer do. The last two budgets have seen billions spent trying to reduce the problems that have become ever-more obvious, from increasing use of food banks to private landlords refusing to take people on universal credit. But this speech demonstrates that Ms Rudd believes a more fundamental assessment of the benefit is needed. That makes her the first work and pensions secretary since Iain Duncan Smith to try to take responsibility for welfare reform rather than simply managing the existing system. She will need to convince the Treasury in particular to back her judgement. Speaking in south London, Ms Rudd insisted that the system would still be fully rolled out by 2023 - but added she would consider the findings from a pilot due to run in 2019. Concerning changes to benefit recipients, Ms Rudd said she recognised claims by charities that the current one payment per household system ""penalises women"". Advocacy groups such asRefuge,externalandWomen's Aid,externalhave argued that the system can mean victims of domestic violence are denied access to benefits by their partners. Ms Rudd said: ""Women can never be truly free until they have economic independence"". ""That is why I am committed to ensuring that household payments go directly to the main carer, who is usually - but not always - the woman."" She said 60% of payments already go to the woman's bank account but she was looking at ways to ensure the primary recipient of the benefit is the main carer. This video can not be played Universal credit: Is the government's benefit system working? Ms Rudd also suggested that the longstanding benefit freeze - which was introduced in 2016 - could finish, saying ""it should come to an end"" in 2020. And she said her department would build an online system for private landlords so they can request for rent to be paid directly to them. Ms Rudd argued this would give landlords ""greater certainty"" that rent would be paid, and make it easier for tenants in the private sector to keep their homes. Currently just 5% of private landlords who are paid through universal credit receive the rental payment directly from government. The minister also said she had asked Job Centre Plus to test how payments to claimants could be made more frequently. She added that once this had been piloted, frequent payments could be made available ""more widely so those in genuine need can take it up more easily"". BBC political correspondent Ross Hawkins said Ms Rudd also remained under pressure to shorten a five-week wait before new universal credit claims are paid. Ms Rudd's changes only protect families with children born before April 2017. For families where the third child is born after April 2017, the changes have no effect and the impacts the chart is showing still hold Universal credit merges six older benefits into one new one, and is being introduced gradually across the UK. Instead of applying for lots of different payments, for different things, one payment is calculated based on all of someone's circumstances, like: â¢             being unemployed â¢             working on a low income â¢             needing help with housing costs â¢             having children â¢             having an illness or disability It can be claimed by people both in and out of work. How much someone in work claiming universal credit receives each month is based on how much they earned in the previous month. And unlike with some old benefits, there's no limit to the hours someone can work per week and still claim. But as they earn more, their benefit payment reduces gradually. This is designed to mean ""work always pays"" - that is, in theory someone never loses more in benefits than they have gained through taking extra hours of work. Some households will receive less money from universal credit than they would have done under the old system, while others will receive more. This is partly down to the intentional design of the system and partly a side-effect of cuts that have been made as the benefit was introduced. On the two-child limit, Ms Rudd said it was ""not right"" for it to apply to those who had their children before the cap was announced. ""These parents made decisions about the size of the family when the previous system was the only system in place,"" she said. The""child element"" of universal credit varies,,externalbut is worth at least Â£231.67 a child per month. The Child Poverty Action Group said the decision was ""fantastically good news"", but said the two-child cap should be scrapped for all future families too. Labour also called for the cap to be removed, stressing the change ""does not go far enough"". Leading economic research group the Institute for Fiscal Studies said the announcement ""makes no difference to the long-run generosity of the benefit system"". ""Eventually all children will be born after April 2017, and so the two-child limit will apply to all families with more than two children."" But the IFS added: ""What this reform does do is to slow down substantially the speed of the rollout of the policy - its long-run impact will now not be fully felt until the mid-2030s."" Ms Rudd, who became work and pensions secretary in November, accepted there were problems with universal credit, and promised to ""learn from errors"" and ""adjust"" the system after taking expert guidance. Her predecessor Esther McVey had already announced changes to ensure claimants were given more time to switch to the benefit and would not have to wait so long for their money. The system had been the target of complaints that it was forcing some claimants into destitution and even prostitution. This video can not be played Struggling with universal credit in Hartlepool However, Ms Rudd defended universal credit as ""a force for good"", adding that ""it pumps much needed fresh air into a failing system"". ""As a nation, I believe we all want a decent safety net: if you're facing a difficult moment in life, the state should be there to help you. ""But it is vital that people are supported by this safety net, not trapped beneath it."" Will the U-turn help you? Or will you and your family still be subject to the cap?

"Samar Badawi, pictured with Michelle Obama and Hillary Clinton, has campaigned for equality Saudi Arabia drew international plaudits last year when it lifted a longstanding ban on women driving. However, restrictions on women remain - most notably, the ""male guardianship system"", a woman's father, brother, husband or son has the authority to make critical decisions on her behalf. These restrictions were highlighted in early January, when a young Saudi woman fleeing her family barricaded herself in a hotel room in Bangkok saying she feared imprisonment if she was sent back home. A Saudi woman is required to obtain a male relative's approval to apply for a passport, travel outside the country, study abroad on a government scholarship, get married, leave prison, or even exit a shelter for abuse victims. ""This is something that affects every Saudi woman and girl, from birth to death. They are essentially treated like minors,"" the Egyptian-American journalist Mona Eltahawy told the BBC. Saudi woman ends airport hotel standoff Saudi women to get divorce confirmation by text message Saudi women on what life's really like Saudi Arabia ratified theUnited Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women in 2000,externaland has saidgender equality is guaranteed in accordance with the provisions of Sharia, or Islamic law,external. The conservative Gulf kingdom has also reversed a ban on sports for women and girls in public schools, and allowed women to watch football matches in stadiums. However, UN experts expressed concern in February 2018 atthe country's failure to adopt a specific law prohibiting discrimination against women,external, as well as the absence of a legal definition of discrimination against women. The male guardianship system, the experts noted, was ""the key obstacle to women's participation in society and economy"". Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman and his father King Salman have introduced some reforms The system is said to be derived from the Saudi religious establishment's interpretation of a Koranic verse,externalthat says: ""Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because God has given the one more [strength] than the other, and because they support them from their means."" Human Rights Watch reported in 2016 thatthe kingdom ""clearly and directly enforces guardianship requirements in certain areas"",external, and a number of women who have challenged the system have faced detention and prosecution. In 2008, the prominent rights activist Samar Badawi, whose father allegedly physically abused her, fled her family home and found refuge at a shelter. She then began legal proceedings to strip her father of her guardianship. In retaliation, she said, her father filed a charge of ""disobedience"" against her,external. A judge ordered her detention in 2010 and she spent seven months in prison before activists drew attention to her case and the authorities dropped the charge. Mariam al-Otaibi was detained for 100 days after she fled her father's house Mariam al-Otaibi, another activist, spent three months in detention in 2017,externalafter her father accused her of ""disobedience"". She had fled her home after allegedly facing abuse from her father and brother in retaliation for leading social media campaigns against the guardianship system. Her eventual release from prison was hailed as a victory by fellow activists because it took place without a male guardian. Even women who have fled abroad have been unable to avoid detention. In 2017, Dina Ali Lasloom was forcibly returned to her family in Saudi Arabia while in transit in the Philippines en route to Australia. She had said she was escaping a forced marriage. Human Rights Watch said it received reports that Ms Lasloom was detained in a shelter for some time. It is not clear if she has since been returned to her family. This video can not be played (June 2018) Saudi women hit the road Women's rights activists have long called for an end to the guardianship system. In September 2016 they handed over a petition containing 14,000 signatures to the Royal Court, after the Arabic hashtag ""Saudi women want to abolish the guardianship system"" went viral on Twitter and sparked a large-scale campaign. The Grand Mufti, Abdulaziz Al Sheikh, described the petition as a ""crime against the religion of Islam and an existential threat to Saudi society"", but five months laterKing Salman issued a decree allowing women to access government services without being required to obtain a male guardian's approval,external.

She had escaped on foot from a remote home where she had been held against her will after her parents' murder. Police say the suspect took steps to conceal his identity Jayme has been reunited with her aunt, said officials during a news conference on Friday, and she is ""doing as well as circumstances allow"".

Barron County Sheriff Chris Fitzgerald said the girl had not connected with Mr Patterson on social media, and the suspect had had no contact with anyone else in the family. The lawman noted police information was ""limited"" and Jayme is still being interviewed, but she has been medically cleared and released from hospital.

This video can not be played Aunt tearfully reacts to missing Wisconsin girl found safe Jayme was discovered on Thursday in the small town of Gordon, some 70 miles (110km) from her home in Barron. According to Douglas County Sheriff Tom Dalbec, Gordon police pinpointed and arrested Mr Patterson 11 minutes later thanks to a description of his vehicle that Jayme provided. FBI Special Agent Justin Tolomeo told reporters: ""In cases like this we often need a big break - it was Jayme herself who gave us that break."" Sheriff Fitzgerald said investigators did not yet know how Jayme escaped from the rural home or how the suspect was keeping her there. He said the suspect was not at home when Jayme fled, and that he was probably driving around looking for her when police arrested him. Local teacher Jeanne Nutter was walking her dog when she found Jayme on Thursday. Shetold the Associated Press,externalthat the girl had shouted ""please help me, I don't know where I am, I'm lost"". Ms Nutter said Jayme was skinny, dirty and wearing shoes too large for her feet. She brought Jayme to the home of neighbours Kristin and Peter Kasinskas, as it was farther away from where she found the teenager. ""It was like I was seeing a ghost,"" Mr Kasinskastold the Minneapolis Star Tribune,external. ""My jaw just went to the floor."" Jayme reportedly stayed at the home for about 20 minutes, declining food and water. The area where Jayme was eventually found is a remote community with around 30 homes near the Eau Claire River, the Star Tribune reported. During the nationwide search for Jayme, officials from the FBI, state patrol and local law enforcement had received thousands of tips. A police car blocks the road where Jayme was found on January 11 in Gordon, Wisconsin Sheriff Fitzgerald said Mr Patterson has no criminal history in the state of Wisconsin. Police are still determining how he became aware of Jayme. He said the unemployed suspect had ties to the city of Barron, where the Closses lived, and may have worked in the area. Investigators say he took ""many proactive steps"" to hide his identity from law enforcement and the public, including shaving his head to change his appearance and avoid leaving any trace of evidence at the crime scene. ""The suspect had specific intentions to kidnap Jayme and went to great lengths to prepare to take her,"" Sheriff Fitzgerald said. Police have recovered several guns that appear to belong to Mr Patterson, including a shotgun that resembles the weapon ballistics experts suspect was used in the killing of Jayme's parents. Mr Patterson lived just a few houses away from the Kasinskas family, and Mrs Kasinskas had been one of his school teachers,the Associated Press reported,external. Mrs Kasinskas told the Associated Press she had not seen him on their street or in town since high school, describing him as ""a quiet kid"". ""I don't recall anything that would have explained this, by any means,"" she added. Mr Patterson was interviewed by Douglas County officials and transported to the Barron County jail. Sheriff Fitzgerald did not comment on whether Mr Patterson was co-operating, but said he has been in his cell ""without incident"". Barron County District Attorney Brian Right said the suspect is due to appear in court on Monday. Sheriff Fitzgerald said Jayme had been taken against her will and held captive Jayme Closs went missing on Monday 15 October 2018, after emergency services received a mobile phone call from her family address in Barron. 911 dispatchers heard a disturbance in the background, but no-one spoke to them directly. When police arrived at the home four minutes later, they found the parents, James and Denise Closs, shot dead. There was no sign of Jayme, nor of a suspect or murder weapon. The Closses' deaths were ruled as homicide by a medical examiner. Jayme's aunt, Sue Allard, told the Star Tribune: ""It's the news we've been waiting on for three months.

"This video can not be played 'I hope the prime minister will listen' Conservative rebel Dominic Grieve has urged the prime minister to delay Brexit if her EU withdrawal deal is rejected by MPs next week. Mr Grieve, who backs calls for another referendum, said she could remove the 29 March date from UK legislation and ask the EU for more time. Cabinet ministers who oppose leaving the EU without a deal had a ""duty to resign"" if she refused to do so. Ministers warn the UK faces Brexit ""paralysis"" if the deal is rejected. And the prime minister's spokesman said on Friday that the government wouldn't extend Article 50, the legal mechanism taking Britain out of the EU on 29 March. Can Parliament stop a no-deal Brexit? UK faces Brexit 'paralysis' - Hunt Kuenssberg: What could change dynamics of Brexit vote? Mr Grieve, who tabled the amendment that led to a government defeat on Wednesday, has been at the forefront of cross-party efforts to ensure MPs have a say in what happens if Mrs May's deal is voted down. In those circumstances, another of Mr Grieve's amendments means that the Commons will then have a chance to vote on alternative policies - everything from a ""managed no-deal"" to a further referendum could be on the table. MPs are widely expected to reject the withdrawal deal negotiated between the EU and UK in a key Commons vote on Tuesday, with more than 100 Conservative MPs among those opposing it. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that the possibility of Brexit not happening at all had increased, with Parliament showing this week it would not accept leaving without a deal. This he said would be an ""incredibly damaging breach of trust and it would also be very bad for Britain's reputation abroad"". This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt tells Today that no Brexit is 'in sight' and blames the Speaker John Bercow But former attorney general Mr Grieve, who earlier addressed a rally of people calling for another referendum, said he hoped that cabinet ministers known to be opposed to a no-deal Brexit would be ""frank"" with the PM, if - as expected - she loses next week's vote. ""I think the options are very limited and the reality in my view is that the only way out of this difficulty is go back to the public and ask for their opinion,"" he said. He said, if MPs reject the deal, the government should act immediately to strike the 29 March Brexit date from UK legislation before going to the EU to ask for an extension of the Article 50 process. ""I believe the EU will extend Article 50 for us but I think they would only do it in a very limited number of circumstances ... and we need to explore what those circumstances may be."" If the prime minister would not agree to do so, he added: ""If a cabinet minister feels the government is doing something they can't accept, it is probably their duty to resign"". ""My feeling is that this will have its own dynamic and whilst I want to keep the government stable ... I hope the prime minister will listen carefully to what members of Parliament and members of her own government are saying to her."" A ""no-deal"" Brexit is where the UK would cut ties with the European Union overnight without a transition period. Theresa May's government, and many others, believe this would be hugely damaging and want a more gradual withdrawal. But if Parliament can't agree on that, and nothing else takes its place, the UK could still leave without a deal. This would mean the UK would not have to obey EU rules. Instead, it would need to follow World Trade Organization terms on trade. Many businesses would see new taxes on imports, exports and services, which are likely to increase their operating costs. That means the prices of some goods in UK shops could go up. The UK would also lose the trade agreements it had with other countries as a member of the EU, all of which would need to be renegotiated alongside the new agreement with the EU itself. Manufacturers in the UK expect to face delays in components coming across the border. The UK would be free to set its own immigration controls. However some UK professionals working in the EU and UK expats could face uncertainty. Some countries, such as Spain, Germany and the Netherlands, have given temporary guarantees about residency status and rights, but there is not yet an agreed policy for UK citizens across the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The situation for holidays and business trips is a little clearer, as the European Commission has said that even in a no-deal scenario, UK travellers won't need a visa for short visits of up to 90 days. The border between Northern Ireland and the Irish republic would become an external frontier for the EU with customs and immigration controls, though how and where any checks would be made is not clear. Some Leave supporters think that leaving without a deal would be positive if the right preparations were made. They say criticism is scaremongering and any short term pain would be for long term gain. But critics - including both Brexit supporters and opponents - say that leaving without a deal would be a disaster for the UK: driving up food prices, leading to shortages of goods and gridlock on some roads in the South East resulting from extra border checks. Earlier he said it was the duty of MPs to ""stop people committing national suicide"" by going ahead with a no-deal Brexit. The pound roseon Friday after areport in London's Evening Standard,externalsuggested Brexit looked increasingly likely to be delayed. However, during the third day of Commons debate on Mrs May's withdrawal deal, another senior pro-EU Tory backbencher, Sir Nicholas Soames, warned against moves to extend the Article 50 process. ""I believe it would be quite wrong to postpone the Article 50 deadline and the House must be prepared to earn the undying contempt of the country if it simply does not have the collective will, discipline and sense of duty to come to an agreement"", he added. Meanwhile, as many as 4,000 civil servants are being asked to move from their usual work to prepare for and handle a possible ""no deal"" Brexit. The departments which will see staff redeployed include Defence,  International Development, Work and Pensions and the Education department. The plans involve moving some staff within their department, and transferring others to departments and agencies with the greatest extra no-deal-related workload, such as HMRC and Defra. according to a memoleaked to The Times,external. A government spokesman said: ""As we get closer to the time where we will leave the EU, it is sensible and right for the Civil Service to accelerate preparations.""

"This video can not be played Swiss Alps avalanche: Workers clear snow from inside the hotel Heavy snowfalls brought chaos to parts of Germany and Sweden on Friday, leaving roads blocked, trains halted and schools shut. The Red Cross helped drivers stuck on a motorway in the southern German state of Bavaria and a nine-year-old boy was killed by a falling tree. The front of a Swiss hotel was hit by an avalanche and a winter storm made roads impassable in Sweden and Norway. Austrian rescuers had to battle through chest-deep snow to reach a snowboarder. The 41-year-old Pole had lost his way after going off piste at the resort of Schlossalmbahn. Rescuers said the Polish snowboarder was stuck on an icy rock covered in two metres of snow There was some respite in Austria on Friday, after three metres (10ft) of snow fell in some parts in previous days. Seven people have died in the past week and two hikers have been missing since Saturday. ""Such quantities of snow above 800m altitude only happen once every 30 to 100 years,"" said Alexander Radlherr from Austria's Central Institution for Meteorology and Geodynamics. This video can not be played Heavy snow continues to hit parts of Europe The Austrian military sent helicopters to blow snow off treetops to reduce the risk of trees falling on roads and rails. In Sweden wintry storms ravaged parts of the north. One area recorded winds of 49.7m per second (111mph) as Storm Jan ravaged Stekenjokk near the Norwegian border. In northern Norway, a lorry driver described on Friday morning how he and other drivers had been stuck on a mountain road since 17:00 (16:00 GMT) on Thursday. Magnar Nicolaisen told public broadcaster NRK that he had slept in his cabin overnight while others had had to stay in their cars. Some of the heaviest snow was in Bavaria where some villages were cut off Conditions on Friday were particularly treacherous in Bavaria, where the local broadcaster said snowfalls were paralysing public life. Rail services were worst hit in the south and east of the state and roads were cut off by drifts and falling trees. A boy of nine was killed near Munich when a tree collapsed under the weight of snow. It was 40 minutes before he was found and emergency services were unable to revive him. Two sections of the big A8 autobahn were closed in the south-east, as drivers spent Thursday night at a standstill near Rosenheim. The Bavarian Red Cross and a government agency came to the aid of the drivers. The armed forces were sent in when hundreds of people were cut off near Berchtesgaden Roads in the Berchtesgaden area close to the Austrian border were blocked and the army sent up to 200 soldiers to help hundreds of people caught up in the snow. There was a let-up in the weather on Friday ahead of expected further snowfalls on Saturday night. However, some 90 flights were cancelled in Munich while some flights in Frankfurt were also hit. In Switzerland, an avalanche hit a hotel restaurant, injuring three people. Local reports said the avalanche had been 300m in width when it came down the SchwÃ¤galp. Hotel guests were stunned when the avalanche crashed into the back of the restaurant Rescuers searched the area on Friday in case anyone near the Hotel SÃ¤ntis had been caught up in the avalanche. Cars were left buried in the snow and even a bus was left partly submerged. One guest in the hotel restaurant said that initially he thought snow was falling from the roof. ""There there was a gigantic noise, and the back area of the restaurant was engulfed in masses of snow,"" the guest told Tagblatt. Some hotel guests were taken to safety on Thursday night and the remainder were moved on Friday, Swiss reports said. The outside of the hotel showed some of the damage caused by the avalanche Heavy snow hits Europe.

"This video can not be played 'I don't need a wall, I want money to plant crops' Hundreds of thousands of US government workers have missed their first payday of the year as the partial shutdown of federal agencies bites deeper. Employees such as prison guards, airport staff and FBI agents have been working without pay. The government shutdown, which began last month, will become the longest in history on Saturday on its 22nd day. President Donald Trump is refusing to approve a federal budget unless it includes funding for a border wall. But Democrats have rejected his request for $5.7bn (Â£4.5bn). About a quarter of the federal government is out of operation until a spending plan is agreed, leaving 800,000 employees unpaid. How much has shutdown hit US economy? On Friday, those workers missed their first payday of this shutdown. Some shared their blank payslips on social media. Oscar Murillo, an aerospace engineer at Nasa, posted his $0 cheque on Twitter and said he had actually lost money because of mandatory deductions. Another Twitter user, Cat Heifner, shared what she said was her brother's payslip, showing he had been paid one cent for his work as an air traffic controller. Allow Twitter content?

""We need money to pay bills."" A food bank in Washington, DC reported an influx of federal workers. This video can not be played Just why has the US government partially shut down? Radha Muthiah, head of Capital Area Food Bank, said that dozens of volunteers are working to pack bags of food for affected staff. Of the 800,000 federal employees going unpaid, about 350,000 are furloughed - a kind of temporary lay-off - while the rest are continuing to work. Thousands have reportedly applied for unemployment benefits amid the financial uncertainty. One major airport, Miami International, will close an entire terminal this weekend because so many security staff have called in sick. Sixteen ways the US shutdown is hurting Where do we go from here? The House and Senate overwhelmingly passed a bill on Friday to ensure all government workers receive retroactive pay after the shutdown ends. The president is expected to sign the legislation. But that may be small consolation to those federal employees currently in dire straits, with no end in sight to the impasse. At a roundtable discussion about border security on Friday with state and local leaders, Mr Trump again demanded that Democrats approve funding for a wall or steel barrier. How much of Trump's wall has been built? What border politicians think of Trump's wall ""Name it 'peaches',"" the Republican president said. ""I don't care what they name it, but we need money for that barrier."" However, the Democratic leader of the US House of Representatives said the ball was in Mr Trump's court. Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters: ""When the president acts, we will respond to whatever he does."" Mr Trump visited the US-Mexico border in Mission, Texas, on Thursday Mr Trump has been threatening to declare a national emergency, which would allow him to bypass Congress and build the wall by raiding military budgets. But on Friday he stepped back from such a move, which would provoke constitutional uproar and legal challenges. He maintained he had a right to declare the emergency, but added: ""I'm not going to do it so fast."" This video can not be played Five questions about Trump's border wall According to the Associated Press, senior White House aide Jared Kushner is among those who have urged caution to Mr Trump on the issue. US media report the White House is considering diverting some of the $13.9bn allocated last year by Congress for disaster relief in such areas as Puerto Rico, Texas and California to pay for the wall. But Republican congressman Mark Meadows, who is close to the president, said that option was not under serious consideration.

"This video can not be played 'I hope the prime minister will listen' Conservative rebel Dominic Grieve has urged the prime minister to delay Brexit if her EU withdrawal deal is rejected by MPs next week. Mr Grieve, who backs calls for another referendum, said she could remove the 29 March date from UK legislation and ask the EU for more time. Cabinet ministers who oppose leaving the EU without a deal had a ""duty to resign"" if she refused to do so. Ministers warn the UK faces Brexit ""paralysis"" if the deal is rejected. And the prime minister's spokesman said on Friday that the government wouldn't extend Article 50, the legal mechanism taking Britain out of the EU on 29 March. Can Parliament stop a no-deal Brexit? UK faces Brexit 'paralysis' - Hunt Kuenssberg: What could change dynamics of Brexit vote? Mr Grieve, who tabled the amendment that led to a government defeat on Wednesday, has been at the forefront of cross-party efforts to ensure MPs have a say in what happens if Mrs May's deal is voted down. In those circumstances, another of Mr Grieve's amendments means that the Commons will then have a chance to vote on alternative policies - everything from a ""managed no-deal"" to a further referendum could be on the table. MPs are widely expected to reject the withdrawal deal negotiated between the EU and UK in a key Commons vote on Tuesday, with more than 100 Conservative MPs among those opposing it. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that the possibility of Brexit not happening at all had increased, with Parliament showing this week it would not accept leaving without a deal. This he said would be an ""incredibly damaging breach of trust and it would also be very bad for Britain's reputation abroad"". This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt tells Today that no Brexit is 'in sight' and blames the Speaker John Bercow But former attorney general Mr Grieve, who earlier addressed a rally of people calling for another referendum, said he hoped that cabinet ministers known to be opposed to a no-deal Brexit would be ""frank"" with the PM, if - as expected - she loses next week's vote. ""I think the options are very limited and the reality in my view is that the only way out of this difficulty is go back to the public and ask for their opinion,"" he said. He said, if MPs reject the deal, the government should act immediately to strike the 29 March Brexit date from UK legislation before going to the EU to ask for an extension of the Article 50 process. ""I believe the EU will extend Article 50 for us but I think they would only do it in a very limited number of circumstances ... and we need to explore what those circumstances may be."" If the prime minister would not agree to do so, he added: ""If a cabinet minister feels the government is doing something they can't accept, it is probably their duty to resign"". ""My feeling is that this will have its own dynamic and whilst I want to keep the government stable ... I hope the prime minister will listen carefully to what members of Parliament and members of her own government are saying to her."" A ""no-deal"" Brexit is where the UK would cut ties with the European Union overnight without a transition period. Theresa May's government, and many others, believe this would be hugely damaging and want a more gradual withdrawal. But if Parliament can't agree on that, and nothing else takes its place, the UK could still leave without a deal. This would mean the UK would not have to obey EU rules. Instead, it would need to follow World Trade Organization terms on trade. Many businesses would see new taxes on imports, exports and services, which are likely to increase their operating costs. That means the prices of some goods in UK shops could go up. The UK would also lose the trade agreements it had with other countries as a member of the EU, all of which would need to be renegotiated alongside the new agreement with the EU itself. Manufacturers in the UK expect to face delays in components coming across the border. The UK would be free to set its own immigration controls. However some UK professionals working in the EU and UK expats could face uncertainty. Some countries, such as Spain, Germany and the Netherlands, have given temporary guarantees about residency status and rights, but there is not yet an agreed policy for UK citizens across the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The situation for holidays and business trips is a little clearer, as the European Commission has said that even in a no-deal scenario, UK travellers won't need a visa for short visits of up to 90 days. The border between Northern Ireland and the Irish republic would become an external frontier for the EU with customs and immigration controls, though how and where any checks would be made is not clear. Some Leave supporters think that leaving without a deal would be positive if the right preparations were made. They say criticism is scaremongering and any short term pain would be for long term gain. But critics - including both Brexit supporters and opponents - say that leaving without a deal would be a disaster for the UK: driving up food prices, leading to shortages of goods and gridlock on some roads in the South East resulting from extra border checks. Earlier he said it was the duty of MPs to ""stop people committing national suicide"" by going ahead with a no-deal Brexit. The pound roseon Friday after areport in London's Evening Standard,externalsuggested Brexit looked increasingly likely to be delayed. However, during the third day of Commons debate on Mrs May's withdrawal deal, another senior pro-EU Tory backbencher, Sir Nicholas Soames, warned against moves to extend the Article 50 process. ""I believe it would be quite wrong to postpone the Article 50 deadline and the House must be prepared to earn the undying contempt of the country if it simply does not have the collective will, discipline and sense of duty to come to an agreement"", he added. Meanwhile, as many as 4,000 civil servants are being asked to move from their usual work to prepare for and handle a possible ""no deal"" Brexit. The departments which will see staff redeployed include Defence,  International Development, Work and Pensions and the Education department. The plans involve moving some staff within their department, and transferring others to departments and agencies with the greatest extra no-deal-related workload, such as HMRC and Defra. according to a memoleaked to The Times,external. A government spokesman said: ""As we get closer to the time where we will leave the EU, it is sensible and right for the Civil Service to accelerate preparations.""

"The fatberg in Sidmouth is the largest South West Water has ever discovered A new standard for flushable wet wipes has been announced, amid concerns about sewer-blocking fatbergs, solid masses of fat, wet wipes and grease, which can be hundreds of feet long. Water UK, the industry body, says wipes will need to pass strict tests to gain the approved logo, Fine to Flush. It said wet wipeslabelled flushable do not break downand are behind 93% of blockages in UK sewers. There are some 300,000 sewer blockages each year, costing the country Â£100m. That's according to Water UK. ""This is an important step in the battle against blockages. We've all seen the impact of fatbergs recently, and we want to see fewer of them,"" said Michael Roberts, chief executive, of Water UK. A 210ft (64m) fatberg found near Sidmouth this week is the biggest South West Water (SWW) has found and expected to take about eight weeks to remove. Others have been found, including an 820ft (250m) fatberg weighing 130 tonnes which blocked a Victorian-era sewer in east London in 2017 and took nine weeks to remove. Dead horse among weird items found in sewers Monster fatberg found blocking Sidmouth sewer How do you remove a fatberg - and other questions The Fine to Flush tests,set out in a 30 page document,external, scrutinise whether the wipes are able to clear the u-bend, avoid snagging and avoid chemical residues. The tests are being carried out by Swindon-based WRc. Andy Drinkwater, who is in charge of the tests, said one product, from Natracare, will meet the standard. However, Natracare wipes will not initially display the logo as the packaging was ready before the Fine to Flush image was finalised. There are seven or so other products being tested by WRc at the moment, Mr Drinkwater said. Testing each product can cost up to Â£8,000, he added. Laura Foster, head of clean seas at the Marine Conservation Society, said: ""We know that there is huge confusion for consumers on which products can be flushed, resulting in millions being spent on blockages every year.""

"Is there something in your cupboard that could extend your life? If I offered you a superfood that would make you live longer, would you be interested? Naturally it reduces the chances of debilitating heart attacks and strokes as well as life-long diseases such as type-2 diabetes. And it helps keep your weight, blood pressure and cholesterol levels down. I should mention it's cheap and widely available in the supermarket. Fibre - it's not the sexiest thing in the world but a major study has been investigating how much fibre we really need to be eating and found there are huge health benefits. ""The evidence is now overwhelming and this is a game-changer that people have to start doing something about it,"" one of the researchers, Prof John Cummings, tells BBC News. It's well known for stopping constipation - but its health benefits are much broader than that. The researchers, at the University of Otago, in New Zealand, and the University of Dundee say people should be eating a minimum of 25g of fibre per day. But they call this an ""adequate"" amount for improving health and say there are benefits for pushing past 30g (1oz). Well, a banana on its own weighs about 120g but that's not pure fibre. Strip out everything else including all the natural sugars and water, and you're left with only about 3g of fibre. Most people around the world are eating less than 20g of fibre a day. And in the UK, fewer than one in 10 adults eats 30g of fibre daily. On average, women consume about 17g, and men 21g, a day. Fibre is present in fruit, vegetables, wholegrain bread, pasta and lentils You find it in fruit and vegetables, some breakfast cereals, breads and pasta that use whole-grains, pulses such as beans, lentils and chickpeas, as well as nuts and seeds. BBC Food: How carb-clever are you? Elaine Rush, a professor of nutrition at Auckland University of Technology, has put together this example for getting into the 25-30g camp: half a cup of rolled oats - 9g fibre |two Weetabix - 3g fibre| a thick slice of brown bread - 2g fibre |a cup of cooked lentils - 4g fibre| a potato cooked with the skin on - 2g fibre |half a cup of chard (or silverbeet in New Zealand) - 1g fibre| a carrot - 3g fibre |an apple with the skin on - 4g fibre But she says: ""It is not easy to increase fibre in the diet."" Prof Cummings agrees. ""It's a big change for people,"" he says. ""It's quite a challenge."" The UK's National Health Service hasa page full of them,external. They include: cooking potatoes with the skin on |swapping white bread, pasta and rice for wholemeal versions| choosing high-fibre breakfast cereals such as porridge oats |chucking some chickpeas, beans or lentils in a curry or over a salad| having nuts or fresh fruit for snacks or dessert |consuming at least five portions of fruit or vegetables each day BBC Food: High fibre breakfasts Well, after analysing 185 studies and 58 clinical trials, the results are in and have been published inthe Lancet medical journal,external. It suggests if you shifted 1,000 people from a low fibre diet (less than 15g) to a high-fibre one (25-29g), then it would prevent 13 deaths and six cases of heart disease. That's during the course of these studies, which tended to follow people for one to two decades. It also showed lower levels of type-2 diabetes and bowel cancer as well as lower weight, blood pressure and cholesterol levels. And the more fibre people ate, the better. There used to be a view that fibre didn't do much at all - that the human body could not digest it and it just sailed through. But fibre makes us feel full and affects the way fat is absorbed in the small intestine - and things really become interesting in the large intestines, when your gut bacteria get to have their dinner. The large intestines are home to billions of bacteria - and fibre is their food. It's a bit like a brewery down there, admittedly one you wouldn't want a pint from, where bacteria are fermenting fibre to make a whole load of chemicals. This includes short-chain fatty acids, which are absorbed and have effects throughout the body. ""We have this organ set up to digest fibre, which a lot of people just don't use very much,"" says Prof Cummings.

""Its findings do imply that, though increasingly popular in the community at large, any dietary regimes that recommend very low-carbohydrate diets should consider the opportunity cost of missing out on fibre from whole-grains.

The study has been done to help the World Health Organization come up with official guidelines for how much fibre people should be eating to boost health and they are expected next year. Follow James onTwitter,external One of the suggested ways of boosting the amount of fibre in your diet is to switch from white bread to brown or wholemeal. This is what has been happening to sales of those products, based ona succession of government surveys,externalof household spending since 1974. From the mid-seventies to the mid-eighties, white bread fell while brown and wholemeal rose. Since then, white bread sales have continued to fall, but brown and wholemeal bread sales have been falling for most of that period, although at a slower rate. So it looks as if while overall demand for bread has been falling, a higher proportion of bread sold has been higher fibre. Whole wheat pasta has made less of an impact on sales than higher fibre breads, with a survey for theBritish Journal of Nutrition,externalfinding that pasta accounted for less than 1% of the occasions on which people were consuming whole grains.

"Tributes have been paid to one of the world's leading oncologists, who has died at the age of 67. Martin Gore was a professor at the Institute of Cancer Research and also worked at the Royal Marsden Hospital. The Duke of Cambridge once described him as an inspiration, and the Royal Marsden's chief executive said he had ""inspired generations"" of doctors. The cause of his death is not known. The Times reported he died suddenlyfollowing a yellow fever,externalvaccination. Prof Gore was an oncologist for more than 35 years, researching ovarian cancer, melanoma and renal cell carcinoma. He worked at the Royal Marsden Hospital for over 30 years and was made its medical director in 2006. The cancer expert was made a CBE in the Queen's birthday honours in 2016 for services to oncology. Prof Gore was also awarded the The Royal Marsden's Lifetime Achievement Award in 2015. At the time, the Duke of Cambridge, who is the president of the Royal Marsden, described Prof Gore as ""one of the pioneers of 20th Century cancer care, and a friend, colleague and a trusted doctor to many"" and hailed his ""compassion and kindness"". Prof Justin Stebbing, professor of cancer medicine at Imperial College, worked for Prof Gore in 2000. He said: ""He was like a father figure to all the registrars - I didn't realise until I became a consultant he was the same to them too. ""I remember the detail he went into with everyone and everything, and the team spirit he fostered."" Prof Mel Greaves, from The Institute of Cancer Research, said: ""Martin was something of a force of nature, very energetic, clear thinking and compassionate."" The Times said he had suffered total organ failure soon after having a yellow fever vaccination, although the cause of death has not been confirmed. TheNHS recommends the yellow fever jab,externalfor people who are travelling to areas where the illness is found, including most of sub-Saharan Africa, most of South America, and parts of Central America and the Caribbean. But the vaccination is not always recommended for some people, including: people over the age of 60 people with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV people who are allergic to any of the ingredients in the vaccine, including people with an egg allergy people with a disorder of their thymus gland The NHS says there are some very rare side effects that can occur, including an allergic reaction and problems affecting the brain or organs. ""These occur less than 10 times for every million doses of vaccine given."" Prof Peter Openshaw, past president of the British Society for Immunology, said the overall risk of serious side-effects from the vaccination remains very low, at about one in every 100,000 of vaccine recipients. However, he added: ""It seems that people aged over 60 have a three to four-fold increased risk of experiencing these serious effects compared with younger people. However, this estimate is based on very few reported adverse events. ""This risk has to be balanced against the risk of contracting yellow fever if you are travelling to an infected area - a nasty disease with a high mortality rate."" He said the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) was the UK body charged with looking into adverse side-effects reported from vaccines. ""They will undoubtedly conduct a proper analysis of this case to ensure it was caused by the vaccine rather than an incidental unconnected cause, such as sepsis.""

"The job losses in Bridgend would be phased over the next two years Ford wants to cut 370 workers at an engine plant in south Wales in the first phase of almost 1,000 job losses, BBC Wales understands. Unions have pledged to fight compulsory redundancies at the car giant's plant in Bridgend after they were briefed by Ford management on Friday. It is believed the first tranche of cuts would be offered as voluntary redundancies. Ford is looking to shake up its European operations. It isnearly two years since fears of 1,160 job losses at the plant by 2021 emerged in a worse case scenario. All aboard the walking car Bridgend loses out in global race Bridgend makes engines for Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) but that contract finishes at the end of 2019, at around the same time the plant will stop making the Ford Ecoboost engine The factory, which employs about 1,700 workers, won the investment for Ford's latest petrol engine - the Dragon - but that will only employ around 500. If plans go ahead, the 990 jobs to be lost at Bridgend - almost half of the site's workforce - will go in two phases by 2021, as part of 1,150 losses across the UK. Ford declined to confirm the figures and said it was currently consulting with unions. It said these talks were ahead of it implementing a ""comprehensive transformation strategy"". Production of a new Jaguar engine at Bridgend was halted for a week in October Jeff Beck, GMB organiser, said the union would ""fight for every Ford job"" in Bridgend and across the UK. ""We have been asking the company for two years to clarify the situation regarding jobs and it's not until today that we have had the devastating answer. ""We have now been told 990 jobs will be cut in Bridgend by 2020. This is devastating news for the dedicated workers at Ford and their families. ""Our members there have been extremely loyal to Ford, and we will stand by them."" The Unite union called it ""grim news"" and said shop stewards had been given a briefing. ""It is a devastating blow for our members and their families, as well as having grave implications for the Welsh economy and the supply chain,"" said officer Des Quinn. ""Unite is fully committed to opposing any compulsory redundancies and campaigning strongly for Bridgend to have a viable future."" He said representatives would consult with members over the coming days. ""There are a number of factors behind this grim news - the main ones being challenging market conditions for carmakers generally, a lack of a coherent industrial strategy from the UK government and the uncertainty created by Brexit. ""Over the last two decades the UK car industry has experienced a renaissance of which we can all be proud of. ""The challenge for government, the carmakers and the unions in the near future is to fight very hard to maintain the environment that made that success possible."" This video can not be played The story behind how the Ford engine plant in Bridgend was built between 1977 and 1980. Analysis by Sarah Dickins, BBC Wales economics correspondent We have already heard this week aboutFord's review of its European operations - as well as the cutbacks at Jaguar Land Rover. But this news today is something that unions have feared for nearly two years. This is because it was widely known that Bridgend's contract to make engines for JLR was coming to an end and that Ford's own plans for a new engine had been scaled right back. Ford have said discussions have only just started and details of numbers are ""premature"". But we understand that early talks are around a first tranche of job losses involving voluntary redundancies. Carwyn Jones, Labour Bridgend AM and former first minister, said he and Labour colleague Huw Irranca-Davies would be working to ensure the plant's future. ""It does reflect the uncertainty that all Ford workers face,"" he said. ""I spoke to Ford yesterday. They gave no indication of any particular threat to Bridgend or any other plant for that matter, but they did say they were rethinking the way Ford were operating in Europe,"" he added. Plaid Cymru's Rhun ap Iorwerth called for an urgent economic summit to be organised. ""These reports are devastating - both for the workers directly affected and the wider Welsh economy,"" he said. The 1,000 losses would come alongside 150 in Ford's transport operations, which would affect lorry drivers. On Thursday, the company said it would be speeding upplans to cut structural costs and thousands of jobs would goacross Europe. ""We are taking decisive action to transform the Ford business in Europe,"" said group vice president for Europe, Steven Armstrong. ""We will invest in the vehicles, services, segments and markets that best support a long-term sustainably profitable business, creating value for all our stakeholders and delivering emotive vehicles to our customers."" The announcement from Ford came on the same day asJaguar Land Rover said it was axing 4,500 jobsand Honda said it was halting production for six days after Brexit.

"Amber Rudd is prepared to push the Treasury to introduce tax cuts for low paid workers, potentially costing more than a billion pounds. In a major change to the troubled universal credit system, the work and pensions secretary said she favoured calls to cut the ""earnings taper"". This is the rate at which benefits are reduced when claimants earn more money. Ms Rudd indicated support for the taper to be reduced from 63% to 60%. That would cost around Â£1.5bn according to the Centre for Social Justice - which drew up the original plans for universal credit. Reality Check: What's the problem with universal credit? Single mums win universal credit challenge Universal Credit: Will benefit changes affect you? Asked on Newsnight whether she favoured a reduction in the taper rate to 60%, the work and pensions secretary said: ""Yes and of course I would like to see it go down further. I would like every incentive we can find to make sure that people going back into work realise that it is the best thing for them and that they don't get a huge 90% tax rate. ""I have to manage that with the needs of the taxpayer, the demands of the chancellor, the reality of how far we can go in terms of spending with universal credit. But that is always going to be at the top of my mind."" The Centre for Social Justice (CSJ) called it a ""brilliant idea"". ""If government reduced the taper rate from 63% to 60% it would effectively give Britain's lowest paid workers a 3% tax cut, and help make it pay to work more,"" CSJ chief executive Andy Cook said. Former Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, who introduced universal credit, says his original plans were severely undermined by cuts imposed by George Osborne. The original taper rate was meant to be 55%. This was increased to 65% before being cut to the current level of 63% under another former work and pensions secretary, David Gauke. In her Newsnight interview, cabinet divisions on Brexit were also highlighted when Ms Rudd suggested it was wrong to criticise John Bercow's performance this week. Cabinet ministers have been highly critical of the commons speaker after hebroke with precedentto allow the former Attorney General Dominic Grieve to table an amendment to a government business motion. This forces Theresa May to report back to parliament within three sitting days if she loses her Brexit vote next week. ""I'm less inclined to blame the speaker,"" Ms Rudd said. ""I think that what we are seeing is the House asserting itself in the face of its concerns about no deal. I'm not really surprised about that. A majority of MPs are likely to come forward and say they want to stop no deal. I understand that. The real difficulty... is there doesn't seem to be a coalescence around an alternative. The only deal we have is the withdrawal agreement."" You can watchNewsnighton BBC 2 weekdays 22:30 or oniPlayer. Subscribe to the programme onYouTube,externalor follow them onTwitter,external.

"This video can not be played Missing girl praised for 'courageous' escape Wisconsin police have charged a 21-year-old man with murdering a 13-year-old girl's parents last October so he could abduct her. Jake Thomas Patterson was arrested on two counts of first-degree homicide and one count of kidnapping, police said on Friday. Jayme Closs was found alive by the suspect's neighbours on Thursday. She had escaped on foot from a remote home where she had been held against her will after her parents' murder. Police say the suspect took steps to conceal his identity Jayme has been reunited with her aunt, said officials during a news conference on Friday, and she is ""doing as well as circumstances allow"". They described Jayme as the suspect's ""only target"" and said she was ""taken against her will"". Jayme Closs: What we know so far Officials did not expand on why Jayme was snatched. Barron County Sheriff Chris Fitzgerald said the girl had not connected with Mr Patterson on social media, and the suspect had had no contact with anyone else in the family. The lawman noted police information was ""limited"" and Jayme is still being interviewed, but she has been medically cleared and released from hospital. ""There is a reunification process in place going on right now that includes medical mental evaluation, questioning by detectives and FBI agents, and then reunification with family,"" he said. ""It's amazing - the will of that 13-year-old girl to survive and escape."" ""Jayme is the hero in this case there's no question about it."" This video can not be played Aunt tearfully reacts to missing Wisconsin girl found safe Jayme was discovered on Thursday in the small town of Gordon, some 70 miles (110km) from her home in Barron. According to Douglas County Sheriff Tom Dalbec, Gordon police pinpointed and arrested Mr Patterson 11 minutes later thanks to a description of his vehicle that Jayme provided. FBI Special Agent Justin Tolomeo told reporters: ""In cases like this we often need a big break - it was Jayme herself who gave us that break."" Sheriff Fitzgerald said investigators did not yet know how Jayme escaped from the rural home or how the suspect was keeping her there. He said the suspect was not at home when Jayme fled, and that he was probably driving around looking for her when police arrested him. Local teacher Jeanne Nutter was walking her dog when she found Jayme on Thursday. Shetold the Associated Press,externalthat the girl had shouted ""please help me, I don't know where I am, I'm lost"". Ms Nutter said Jayme was skinny, dirty and wearing shoes too large for her feet. She brought Jayme to the home of neighbours Kristin and Peter Kasinskas, as it was farther away from where she found the teenager. ""It was like I was seeing a ghost,"" Mr Kasinskastold the Minneapolis Star Tribune,external. ""My jaw just went to the floor."" Jayme reportedly stayed at the home for about 20 minutes, declining food and water. The area where Jayme was eventually found is a remote community with around 30 homes near the Eau Claire River, the Star Tribune reported. During the nationwide search for Jayme, officials from the FBI, state patrol and local law enforcement had received thousands of tips. A police car blocks the road where Jayme was found on January 11 in Gordon, Wisconsin Sheriff Fitzgerald said Mr Patterson has no criminal history in the state of Wisconsin. Police are still determining how he became aware of Jayme. He said the unemployed suspect had ties to the city of Barron, where the Closses lived, and may have worked in the area. Investigators say he took ""many proactive steps"" to hide his identity from law enforcement and the public, including shaving his head to change his appearance and avoid leaving any trace of evidence at the crime scene. ""The suspect had specific intentions to kidnap Jayme and went to great lengths to prepare to take her,"" Sheriff Fitzgerald said. Police have recovered several guns that appear to belong to Mr Patterson, including a shotgun that resembles the weapon ballistics experts suspect was used in the killing of Jayme's parents. Mr Patterson lived just a few houses away from the Kasinskas family, and Mrs Kasinskas had been one of his school teachers,the Associated Press reported,external. Mrs Kasinskas told the Associated Press she had not seen him on their street or in town since high school, describing him as ""a quiet kid"". ""I don't recall anything that would have explained this, by any means,"" she added. Mr Patterson was interviewed by Douglas County officials and transported to the Barron County jail. Sheriff Fitzgerald did not comment on whether Mr Patterson was co-operating, but said he has been in his cell ""without incident"". Barron County District Attorney Brian Right said the suspect is due to appear in court on Monday. Sheriff Fitzgerald said Jayme had been taken against her will and held captive Jayme Closs went missing on Monday 15 October 2018, after emergency services received a mobile phone call from her family address in Barron. 911 dispatchers heard a disturbance in the background, but no-one spoke to them directly. When police arrived at the home four minutes later, they found the parents, James and Denise Closs, shot dead. There was no sign of Jayme, nor of a suspect or murder weapon. The Closses' deaths were ruled as homicide by a medical examiner. Jayme's aunt, Sue Allard, told the Star Tribune: ""It's the news we've been waiting on for three months. ""I can't wait to get my arms around her. I just can't wait."" Her uncle, Jeff Closs,told KARE News,externalthe family had ""thought it was going to be a different ending"". A survivor of one of America's most infamous kidnaps has welcomed the news.

"Mark and Sharon Beresford launched the Win a Megahome competition in March 2018. The owners of a Â£3m home have been criticised by entrants in a so-called property raffle draw to win it. Mark and Sharon Beresford offered their luxury home in Ringwood, Hampshire, as the prize but only sold about Â£750,000 worth of the Â£25 tickets. Entrants claimed the substitute Â£110,000 cash prize was too low. Mr Beresford said he ""fully complied"" with all laws and competition rules and that he had incurred ""very high costs"" running the promotion. The Win a Megahome competition was launched in March 2018, with the 7,000sq ft Huf Haus property as the prize. After it closed at the end of the year, the couple announced ""almost 30,000"" tickets had been sold. The luxury home was described as 'an idyllic house in a fantastic location' Under the terms and conditions, if fewer than 175,000 tickets were sold, a cash prize would be offered instead. The terms allowed the Beresfords to keep a quarter of the revenue, leaving the rest for prize money, minus the costs of promoting the competition. It left prize money of Â£110,070 which was won by an unnamed person from Christchurch. Tweets, since deleted, show the couple were still promoting the house as the main prize even though ticket sales were low Many people expressed anger and frustration on social media about the promotion costs and the competition still being promoted a day before it closed, even though there was little chance the house would be the main prize. James Hill, who bought eight tickets with three friends, said: ""After the competition people clearly wanted answers as to why the prize fund was so low."" Bob Holmes, who bought six tickets, said: ""We live in a council house, so this would have been an absolute dream."" Under the terms and conditions of the competition, if fewer than 175,000 tickets were sold, a cash prize would be offered instead. Mr Beresford insisted the eventual prize was still ""substantial"" and was calculated in accordance with the terms. In a statement, he said: ""The costs incurred were very high and began in 2016 with extensive legal advice and opinions about the interpretation of the rules covering prize draw competitions. ""To do this properly is neither cheap nor for the faint of heart. We will file our accounts in line with statutory requirements.""

"This video can not be played Rosamund, Ella's mother, says she wants to help other families with children who are affected The family of a nine-year-old girl who died from asthma has been given permission to apply for a fresh inquest into her death. It comes after the government's chief lawyer heard new evidence her death could be linked to unlawful levels of air pollution. Ella Kissi-Debrah lived close to one of London's busiest roads. Her mother said she wanted to get to the bottom of the health impact of air pollution on young people. Mrs Adoo-Kissi-Debrah, a teacher, said: ""It's the right decision. Hopefully if we are successful, national government, local government and individuals have to do something about cleaning up the air. ""In two weeks time, Ella would have been 15 years old. This is not going to bring her back, but it will allow us to make sense of why a child who was extremely healthy suddenly got so ill, and focus awareness on what is now a public health crisis. ""It is unacceptable that children in Britain today die from asthma.  We need serious measures to clean up the air like diesel scrappage, better public transport and more cycle lanes,"" she told the WATO programme on Radio 4. Lawyers acting for the family said it was a ""hugely important"" step. Air pollution has never previously been officially recorded on an individual's death certificate. In August, Ella's mother delivered a 100,000-signature petition to Attorney General Geoffrey Cox calling for a new inquest into her daughter's death. He said: ""I have concluded that there is new evidence which may alter the substantial truth of Ella's death. ""I am therefore able to give my permission for an application to the High Court to request a new inquest, based on the evidential test being met."" Ella's lung collapsed in 2011 Ella lived in Lewisham, south London, 25m (80ft) from the South Circular road - a notorious pollution ""hotspot"". She died in February 2013 after experiencing three years of seizures. During that time, local air pollution levels regularly breached EU legal limits. Her last fatal seizure happened during a spike in air pollution levels. An inquest in 2014 found she had died of acute respiratory failure and severe asthma. However, the attorney general's decision has now paved the way for a new inquest to determine whether ""unlawfully high levels of air pollution"" were partially the cause of her death. Human rights lawyer Jocelyn Cockburn, from the firm Hodge Jones and Allen, is acting on behalf of the family. She described the decision as ""hugely strong"" and said the implications went far beyond Ella's case. Ella with her twin brothers ""A wider inquest would look not just at what happened to Ella and the circumstances into her death, but what steps were taken and what lessons can be learned. To look at the wider implications for children's health in that area,"" Ms Cockburn said. ""For me, this case gives an opportunity for those people in public office for protecting our health, to be asked questions and to be held to account and to come up with solutions so we can move towards cleaning up the air as quickly as possible."" One of the grounds for calling a fresh inquest was that permitting illegal levels of air pollution was a potential breach of human rights under Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights - which protects the right to life. Ms Cockburn said: ""A new inquest could mean that a wide range of ""interested parties"" could be called to give evidence. This could include the local authority, the Mayor of London along with the local NHS Trust and Defra."" Ella with flowers after celebrating five years with performing arts school Jigsaw The attorney general's decision followed a report by Prof Stephen Holgate, a leading expert on asthma and air pollution, which found there was a ""striking association"" between Ella's emergency hospital admissions and recorded spikes in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and PM10s, the most noxious pollutants. His report said there was a ""real prospect that without unlawful levels of air pollution, Ella would not have died"". Ella often walked to school along the South Circular Road and Lewisham High Street, a journey that would take 30 to 40 minutes. Or she would be driven and have to sit for lengthy periods in traffic jams. She was first taken to hospital in 2010 after a coughing fit that followed a spike in air pollution levels. She was subsequently admitted to hospital 27 times over three years. Many of these coincided with recorded peaks in air pollution. Her mother said she had resuscitated Ella between 20 and 30 times while waiting for an ambulance. She said that Ella had been treated in five separate hospitals but no medical professional had ever explained that air pollution could be making her asthma worse. The next legal step is for the application to be taken to the High Court, which will decide whether it is ""desirable or necessary"" to have a fresh inquest. While the High Court has the final say, it is highly unusual for the court to disagree with the attorney general. According to Ms Cockburn, decisions made by the attorney general are ""arguably unchallengeable"".

"The bus was carrying 40 passengers, including 22 foreign tourists A bus crash in eastern Cuba has left at least seven people dead, including four foreigners, and dozens others injured, local media say. Two of the foreigners were from Argentina while one was from France and another from Germany. Some 33 people were injured, including citizens from the UK, the US, Canada, France, the Netherlands and Spain. The bus was travelling from Baracoa to the capital, Havana, when it crashed near GuantÃ¡namo on Thursday. The driver told local media that he was driving slowly and lost control due to a wet road at around 15:00 local time (20:00 GMT). Witnesses said he had tried to overtake another vehicle. The bus from the state-owned company Viazul was carrying 40 people, including 22 foreigners. Cuba country profile The accident happened between the eastern cities of Baracoa and GuantÃ¡namo The victims included two Argentinean women, aged 35, a 59-year-old German woman and a 67-year-old Frenchman, according toa list published by Radio GuantÃ¡namo,external. The Cubans were two men, aged 32 and 47, and a 34-year-old woman. Meanwhile, five of the injured were said to be in critical condition in hospital. Their ages range from 42 to 74. The UK Foreign Office said in a statement it was continuing to seek further information from the Cuban authorities and was providing assistance to two British nationals who were injured. Viazul is run by the military's tourism wing and is one of the preferred ways for visitors to travel the island, the BBC's Will Grant in Havana reports. Cuba's roads are notoriously poor with many of them badly-lit and poorly maintained, especially in that region of the country, our correspondent adds. Traffic accidents are common in Cuba and have resulted in some 4,400 deaths since 2012, according to official data.

"This video can not be played The #SaveRahaf campaign went viral after Rahaf started tweeting about her plight for asylum A Saudi woman who fled her family and became stranded at Bangkok's main airport is flying to Canada after being granted asylum status. Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun, 18, had been trying to reach Australia via Bangkok, but was initially told to return to Kuwait, where her family were waiting. She refused to fly back and barricaded herself into her airport hotel room, attracting international attention. She said she had renounced Islam, which is punishable by death in Saudi Arabia. The UN's refugee agency has said it considers her to be a legitimate refugee. Arrested for disobeying your father #SaveRahaf: How Twitter saved a Saudi woman Saudi women on what life's really like Refugee status is normally granted by governments, but the UNHCR can grant it where states are ""unable or unwilling to do so"",according to its website,external. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters: ""Canada has been unequivocal that we will always stand up for human rights and women's rights around the world. When the UN made a request of us that we grant Ms al-Qunun asylum, we accepted."" Canada has previously angered Saudi Arabia after calling for the release of detained women's rights activists in the country -prompting Riyadh to expel Canada's ambassadorand freeze all new trade. Why Trudeau won't back down The UNHCR has welcomed Canada's decision to resettle Ms Qunun. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, said: ""[Her] plight has captured the world's attention over the past few days, providing a glimpse into the precarious situation of millions of refugees worldwide. ""Refugee protection today is often under threat and cannot always be assured, but in this instance international refugee law and overriding values of humanity have prevailed."" She was on a trip to Kuwait with her family, when she fled on a flight to Bangkok. She said she intended to take a connecting flight to Australia - and had an Australian visa - but that her passport was seized by a Saudi diplomat when he met her coming off the flight at Suvarnabhumi airport, leaving her stranded. A Saudi envoy in Bangkok denied any official Saudi involvement in Ms Qunun's detention. Why Saudi Arabia matters to the West Saudi asylum seeker 'taken home' by family Saudi women to get divorce notice by text Thai officials initially described her case as a ""family problem"" and said she would be repatriated back to Kuwait the next day. However, Ms Qunun sent a series of tweets pleading for help from her airport hotel room, and her case was picked up by Human Rights Watch and journalists. A number of countries, including Australia, have considered her case for asylum. Analysis by Jonathan Head, BBC south east Asia correspondent Ms Qunun, seen here at a UN building before leaving Bangkok, is en route to Toronto via Seoul After days of speculation that she would move to Australia, Rahaf al-Qunun found herself on a flight in the opposite direction, to Canada. She was seen briefly, being escorted to the departure gate by UN officials. As her plane took off Police General Surachate Hakparn, the immigration chief whose change of heart on Monday allowed her temporary asylum in Thailand, told journalists she had left the country cheerful and grateful to those who looked after her here. Her father and brother, he said, who had come on what turned out to be a futile visit to try to persuade her to return to Saudi Arabia with them, would be leaving Thailand shortly after her. It is only two days since the Australian government announced that it had been approached to take Ms Qunun, and that it would treat her request sympathetically. The UN usually approaches only one country at a time to seek asylum. It is not clear why the Australian option fell through, and the UN switched to Canada. It might be that Australia's tough line towards refugees, and the insistence of its Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton that she would get no special treatment, threatened to slow down the processing of her application. The UN was concerned about her safety, following online threats to her life, and Canada may have been able to process her resettlement more quickly. Renunciation of Islam is punishable by death in Saudi Arabia. Under Saudi Arabia's ""male guardianship system"", a Saudi woman is required to obtain a male relative's approval to apply for a passport, travel outside the country, study abroad on a government scholarship, get married, leave prison, or even exit a shelter for abuse victims. Ms Qunun told the BBC: ""I shared my story and my pictures on social media and my father is so angry because I did this... I can't study and work in my country, so I want to be free and study and work as I want."" She also said she was afraid her family would kill her. Separately, she told AFP she had suffered physical and psychological abuse from her family, including being locked in her room for six months for cutting her hair. A spokesperson for her family told the BBC that they did not wish to comment and all they cared about was the young woman's safety. On Friday, Ms Qunun wrote on Twitter that she had ""some good news and some bad news"", before deleting her account. Her friends said she had received death threats online. Yes. Ms Qunun's case echoes that of another Saudi woman who was in transit to Australia in April 2017. Dina Ali Lasloom, 24, was en route from Kuwait via the Philippines but was taken back to Saudi Arabia from Manila airport by her family. She used a Canadian tourist's phone to send a message, a video of which was posted to Twitter, saying her family would kill her. Her fate on arriving back in Saudi Arabia remains unknown.

'Sara', a Saudi woman, spoke toBBC OS on the World Service on Wednesday Rahaf is an inspiration. But she's not the first one who did this and definitely not the last one. What we are going through is awful. We think about this every day because us women here do not know what it feels like to go out. We don't know what freedom tastes like. Dad keeps my passport with him all the time, we go to hotels and he puts it next to him when he sleeps. Unfortunately it's not a revolution. Every girl that is tweeting about this, it's either that she has already escaped or she's using a fake account like me. Some people tweeted me or DMed me to tell me to use my real account, for me to be brave. We do not want the guardianship any more. I want to go out of the house and drink coffee from Starbucks.

"The bus was carrying 40 passengers, including 22 foreign tourists A bus crash in eastern Cuba has left at least seven people dead, including four foreigners, and dozens others injured, local media say. Two of the foreigners were from Argentina while one was from France and another from Germany. Some 33 people were injured, including citizens from the UK, the US, Canada, France, the Netherlands and Spain. The bus was travelling from Baracoa to the capital, Havana, when it crashed near GuantÃ¡namo on Thursday. The driver told local media that he was driving slowly and lost control due to a wet road at around 15:00 local time (20:00 GMT). Witnesses said he had tried to overtake another vehicle. The bus from the state-owned company Viazul was carrying 40 people, including 22 foreigners. Cuba country profile The accident happened between the eastern cities of Baracoa and GuantÃ¡namo The victims included two Argentinean women, aged 35, a 59-year-old German woman and a 67-year-old Frenchman, according toa list published by Radio GuantÃ¡namo,external. The Cubans were two men, aged 32 and 47, and a 34-year-old woman. Meanwhile, five of the injured were said to be in critical condition in hospital. Their ages range from 42 to 74. The UK Foreign Office said in a statement it was continuing to seek further information from the Cuban authorities and was providing assistance to two British nationals who were injured. Viazul is run by the military's tourism wing and is one of the preferred ways for visitors to travel the island, the BBC's Will Grant in Havana reports. Cuba's roads are notoriously poor with many of them badly-lit and poorly maintained, especially in that region of the country, our correspondent adds. Traffic accidents are common in Cuba and have resulted in some 4,400 deaths since 2012, according to official data.

"This video can not be played Rosamund, Ella's mother, says she wants to help other families with children who are affected The family of a nine-year-old girl who died from asthma has been given permission to apply for a fresh inquest into her death. It comes after the government's chief lawyer heard new evidence her death could be linked to unlawful levels of air pollution. Ella Kissi-Debrah lived close to one of London's busiest roads. Her mother said she wanted to get to the bottom of the health impact of air pollution on young people. Mrs Adoo-Kissi-Debrah, a teacher, said: ""It's the right decision. Hopefully if we are successful, national government, local government and individuals have to do something about cleaning up the air. ""In two weeks time, Ella would have been 15 years old. This is not going to bring her back, but it will allow us to make sense of why a child who was extremely healthy suddenly got so ill, and focus awareness on what is now a public health crisis. ""It is unacceptable that children in Britain today die from asthma.  We need serious measures to clean up the air like diesel scrappage, better public transport and more cycle lanes,"" she told the WATO programme on Radio 4. Lawyers acting for the family said it was a ""hugely important"" step. Air pollution has never previously been officially recorded on an individual's death certificate. In August, Ella's mother delivered a 100,000-signature petition to Attorney General Geoffrey Cox calling for a new inquest into her daughter's death. He said: ""I have concluded that there is new evidence which may alter the substantial truth of Ella's death. ""I am therefore able to give my permission for an application to the High Court to request a new inquest, based on the evidential test being met."" Ella's lung collapsed in 2011 Ella lived in Lewisham, south London, 25m (80ft) from the South Circular road - a notorious pollution ""hotspot"". She died in February 2013 after experiencing three years of seizures. During that time, local air pollution levels regularly breached EU legal limits. Her last fatal seizure happened during a spike in air pollution levels. An inquest in 2014 found she had died of acute respiratory failure and severe asthma. However, the attorney general's decision has now paved the way for a new inquest to determine whether ""unlawfully high levels of air pollution"" were partially the cause of her death. Human rights lawyer Jocelyn Cockburn, from the firm Hodge Jones and Allen, is acting on behalf of the family. She described the decision as ""hugely strong"" and said the implications went far beyond Ella's case. Ella with her twin brothers ""A wider inquest would look not just at what happened to Ella and the circumstances into her death, but what steps were taken and what lessons can be learned. To look at the wider implications for children's health in that area,"" Ms Cockburn said. ""For me, this case gives an opportunity for those people in public office for protecting our health, to be asked questions and to be held to account and to come up with solutions so we can move towards cleaning up the air as quickly as possible."" One of the grounds for calling a fresh inquest was that permitting illegal levels of air pollution was a potential breach of human rights under Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights - which protects the right to life. Ms Cockburn said: ""A new inquest could mean that a wide range of ""interested parties"" could be called to give evidence. This could include the local authority, the Mayor of London along with the local NHS Trust and Defra."" Ella with flowers after celebrating five years with performing arts school Jigsaw The attorney general's decision followed a report by Prof Stephen Holgate, a leading expert on asthma and air pollution, which found there was a ""striking association"" between Ella's emergency hospital admissions and recorded spikes in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and PM10s, the most noxious pollutants. His report said there was a ""real prospect that without unlawful levels of air pollution, Ella would not have died"". Ella often walked to school along the South Circular Road and Lewisham High Street, a journey that would take 30 to 40 minutes. Or she would be driven and have to sit for lengthy periods in traffic jams. She was first taken to hospital in 2010 after a coughing fit that followed a spike in air pollution levels. She was subsequently admitted to hospital 27 times over three years. Many of these coincided with recorded peaks in air pollution. Her mother said she had resuscitated Ella between 20 and 30 times while waiting for an ambulance. She said that Ella had been treated in five separate hospitals but no medical professional had ever explained that air pollution could be making her asthma worse. The next legal step is for the application to be taken to the High Court, which will decide whether it is ""desirable or necessary"" to have a fresh inquest. While the High Court has the final say, it is highly unusual for the court to disagree with the attorney general. According to Ms Cockburn, decisions made by the attorney general are ""arguably unchallengeable"".

Buku voiced her support for her dad's alleged victims and explained why she waited to speak out about the claims, saying they had been hard to come to terms with. ""It has been very difficult to process it all,"" she wrote in a text-heavy Instagram Story. ""Let alone gather all the right words to express everything I feel."" The documentary Surviving R. Kelly - shown on the US channel Lifetime - exposes detailed accounts of his alleged physical and emotional abuse of women. It claims that the R&B singer allegedly ran an ""abusive cult"" in which he is accused of keeping women captive, against their wills. The programme includes a number of interviews, including with singer John Legend who emphasised he believes the women. Buku said to her 23,600 Instagram followers that she prayed for all the women that say they have been affected by her father's alleged actions. She said she didn't want to talk about her personal life on social media, but because of the intense scrutiny that her father and family were now under, she felt the time was right. ""The same monster you are all confronting me about is my father. I am well aware of who and what he is. I grew up in that house. ""My choice to not speak on him and what he does is for my peace of mind. My emotional state. And for my healing."" Buku signed off the post, saying that she was grateful for everyone's support.

"This video can not be played In January a tearful Andy Murray feared the 2019 Australian Open might have been his last tournament Maybe this is all Andy Murray's fault. So often over the past decade has he made the impossible real, against all precedent and logic, that you never wanted to give up on one final sweet miracle. It won't happen. This is not the end, only because the end has been in progress for a while now - since his first hip operation a year ago, through the painful and truncated comebacks, every time he has limped along a baseline between points like a man twice his age and with half his physical gifts. You don't want to believe it's the end because it still feels so early. Murray is 31. Roger Federer turns 38 in August and goes into the Australian Open looking to win his third title on the bounce. Rafael Nadal went through a three-year period where he failed to win a Grand Slam, has suffered with knee problems throughout his career and recently had ankle surgery - yet still the sensible expect him to win in Paris come early summer. Murray's tears in Melbourne on Fridaytold a different story. Maybe his body will hold up in his first-round match against Roberto Bautista Agut. Maybe he will even beat a man who beat Stan Wawrinka, Novak Djokovic and Tomas Berdych to win the Qatar Open last week. Even if that comes to pass - and only the sentimental and speculative would wager much on it - it changes almost nothing. ""If"" became ""when"" a long time ago. There will be more tears on Monday but it should also feel like a celebration. Murray has been one of the special few who created a dizzy golden period for British sport that took the old cliches of plucky defeats and oh-so-nears and submerged it in a flood of ludicrous success: successive Olympics awash with golds, fourth in a medal table, then third and then second; a British man winning the Wimbledon singles title, a Briton winning the Tour de France, those grails repeated and made commonplace. The moment Murray knew the game was up Murray 'a champion on and off court' - US legend King leads tributes 'Scots look at Murray and are proud he is one of them' Andy Murray: A career in 10 pictures For a man who at the start of it all seemed shy and reticent until the point he was angry and frustrated, Murray almost always took you with him. In the early disappointments, including four defeats in his first four Grand Slam finals, you felt the same mix of regret for what might have been and hope for what still could be. On Wimbledon's Centre Court, where he suffered death by tie-break to Andy Roddick in 2009, where he was overwhelmed by Nadal in consecutive semi-finals over the next two years, his tears in defeat by Federer in the final of 2012 triggered the same response in many watching helplessly. It was never going to happen. The rest were just too good. Until they weren't. Murray's storming run to Olympic gold on the same court a month later encapsulated what that giddy fortnight in London did: it made you a believer, made you bowl about the warm streets with a grin on your face, made you lob the old preconceptions out of the open window. Doubt was still part of it. As Murray went two sets up in the US Open finalthat September only for Djokovic to rapidly bring it back level, a late-night thriller from the city that never sleeps had Britons chewing the edges of their duvets. Even the presence of James Bond in his corner made it no easier to watch. British actor Sean Connery might have whooped and grinned his way through the contest but for most of his compatriots the four hours and 54 minutes until a tired Djokovic backhand return dropped long were somewhere between beautiful dream and dreadful torture. Seven times Murray made us laugh, cry & just feel proud Transcript: Murray news conference in full Newsround: Murray's most memorable moments - in pictures Reaction to Murray's announcement An easy New York cliche would tell us that if Murray could make it there he could make it anywhere. It didn't feel that way on Centre Court on Sunday, 7 July 2013. People had lived and died waiting for a British man to win Wimbledon, and many more were close to the edge in that last excruciating game. Murray was leading 6-4 7-5 5-4. He was 40-0 up. And on serve. First one championship point was lost, then another, then another, then three break points for Djokovic. You can't forget these moments, not when you have gone through them with a sportsman. And when Djokovic's backhand into the net ended it, after 77 years of waiting, no-one knew quite what to do. Murray put his hands to his head. His legs went. He booted a ball into the crowd and fell over and cried. Around the country millions were doing the same and more. This video can not be played Andy Murray: Wimbledon 2013 - the moment he won the title That would have been enough. Except there was so much more, the bewilderment now coming from the fact a lot of what was to come wasn't even that anxious. Murray's second Wimbledon title was a fortnight of total control, sport as a nerveless execution. You could almost enjoy it. You could almost relax. The implausible no longer had the same power. A firstDavis Cup triumph for Britain since 1936?Why not? Becoming world number one, in the most competitive era of all, when Federer, Nadal and Djokovic were stockpiling Grand Slam titles in an unparalleled arms race? Of course. It is one of the melancholy truths of sport that only a few of the greats get to retire on their own terms. Even the strongest, the most tactically astute, are overtaken or outshone in the end. Murray wanted longer. Some of his supporters will still be in a state of partial denial. None have been short-changed or cheated. Murray's successes were never preordained but were the culmination of a lifetime of relentless work and ceaseless ambition. It took him eight attempts to win Wimbledon, four semi-finals to make the final, another to finally step onto the summit. He won Grand Slams for a country that had long ago forgotten how to. He began as an awkward, gawky teenager and ended by winning BBC Sports Personality of the year three times. This is one ending. Murray will be remembered for another: standing under a cloudless July sky six years ago, arms aloft, a famous golden trophy glinting in the warm summer sun. In an era of special sporting memories, that is one to keep you warm long beyond this grey winter.

"Coach Amelie Mauresmo, and Judy Murray have been big influences on Andy Murray Following Andy Murray's announcement that he will retire this year, many prominent women - inside and outside of tennis - have praised him for taking a leading role in fighting sexism. From calling out journalists, to becoming one of the first leading men's tennis players to employ a female coach, he has hit the headlines on numerous occasions. US tennis legend Billie Jean King tweeted: ""Your voice for equality will inspire future generations."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Labour MP Jess Phillips summed it up in her tweet: ""Great player, normal bloke, and best of all casual feminist."" 'Australian Open may be my last event' Oh-so-nears, tears & triumphs - Murray's legacy Why I say Andy Murray is GB's best sportsman The Scot raised eyebrows when he appointed a woman, Amelie Mauresmo,as his coach in 2014. It was a move that resulted in sexist comments from many quarters, including fellow players, and Murray says it turned him into an outspoken feminist. ""Working with Amelie was, for me, because she was the right person for the job, and not a question of her sex at all,""he wrote in a BBC column. ""However, it became clear to me that she wasn't always treated the same as men in similar jobs, and so I felt I had to speak out about that."" Murray said he had never set out to be a spokesperson for women's equality. But he felt Mauresmo faced unfair criticism for his losses - something that his previous male coaches hadn't experienced. In a column for French newspaper L'Equipe, he wrote:,external""Have I become a feminist? Well, if being a feminist is about fighting so that a woman is treated like a man then yes, I suppose I have."" The 31-year-old has spoken candidly about female tennis players deserving to get equal prize money, saying they sacrifice as much as men. ""Anyone who has spent any time with any of the top women will know that they make those same sacrifices and are as determined and committed to winning as any of the top men on the tour,"" he said. He also joined Venus Williams in calling for more women's matches on Wimbledon's Centre Court - after critics complained that a higher number of men's matches were being chosen for the show courts. ""I think ideally you would have two men's and two women's [matches] on Centre,"" he said. And the BBC website felt Murray's wrath when it failed to give Katarina Johnson-Thompson a prominent placing following her gold in the pentathlon at the European World Indoor Championships.

He has also challenged journalists who have forgotten the achievements of female tennis players. When praised by BBC presenter John Inverdale for becoming the first person to win two Olympic gold medals for tennis in 2016, Murray replied: ""Venus and Serena [Williams] have won four each."" This video can not be played Andy Murray corrects journalist over gender claim He was at it again the following year at Wimbledon, when he interrupted a reporter in his press conference after losing to American Sam Querrey. The journalist was midway through asking a question, saying to Murray: ""Sam is the first US player to reach a major semi-final since 2009..."" to which Murray said: ""Male player."" ""I beg your pardon?"" the journalist responded. ""Male player,"" Murray reiterated. Serena Williams, one of the US players whose achievements had been ignored by the journalist, said his response was one of the reasons he was ""loved"" by the female players. She told ESPN at the time: ""I don't think there's a woman player - and there really shouldn't be a female athlete - that is not totally supportive of Andy Murray. ""He has spoken up for women's issues and women's rights, especially in tennis, forever and he does it again."" British number one Johanna Konta said there had been many examples of when Murray had stood up for women's tennis - and women in general. ""I think he's grown up with a really strong female role model with his mum and now his wife is also a strong character, so he is surrounded by great, strong women,"" she said. ""He has put that through in the way he has voiced his opinions and the way he has tackled some questions and issues that have arisen, and I think everybody has always been very appreciative of him."" Former US Open champion Samantha Stosur also said he had been a ""massive advocate"" for women's tennis.

"The bus was carrying 40 passengers, including 22 foreign tourists A bus crash in eastern Cuba has left at least seven people dead, including four foreigners, and dozens others injured, local media say. Two of the foreigners were from Argentina while one was from France and another from Germany. Some 33 people were injured, including citizens from the UK, the US, Canada, France, the Netherlands and Spain. The bus was travelling from Baracoa to the capital, Havana, when it crashed near GuantÃ¡namo on Thursday. The driver told local media that he was driving slowly and lost control due to a wet road at around 15:00 local time (20:00 GMT). Witnesses said he had tried to overtake another vehicle. The bus from the state-owned company Viazul was carrying 40 people, including 22 foreigners. Cuba country profile The accident happened between the eastern cities of Baracoa and GuantÃ¡namo The victims included two Argentinean women, aged 35, a 59-year-old German woman and a 67-year-old Frenchman, according toa list published by Radio GuantÃ¡namo,external. The Cubans were two men, aged 32 and 47, and a 34-year-old woman. Meanwhile, five of the injured were said to be in critical condition in hospital. Their ages range from 42 to 74. The UK Foreign Office said in a statement it was continuing to seek further information from the Cuban authorities and was providing assistance to two British nationals who were injured. Viazul is run by the military's tourism wing and is one of the preferred ways for visitors to travel the island, the BBC's Will Grant in Havana reports. Cuba's roads are notoriously poor with many of them badly-lit and poorly maintained, especially in that region of the country, our correspondent adds. Traffic accidents are common in Cuba and have resulted in some 4,400 deaths since 2012, according to official data.

"Growth in the UK's economy slowed in the three months to November, expanding at its weakest pace in six months. The economy grew by 0.3% during the period, less than the 0.4% in the three months to October, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. The ONS said manufacturers suffered their longest period of monthly falls in output since the financial crisis, being hit by weaker overseas demand. It also said the economy grew by 0.2% in November, up from 0.1% in October. Rob Kent-Smith, head of national accounts at the ONS, said: ""Growth in the UK economy continued to slow in the three months to November after performing more strongly through the middle of the year. ""Accountancy and house building again grew but a number of other areas were sluggish. ""Manufacturing saw a steep decline, with car production and the often-erratic pharmaceutical industry both performing poorly."" Month on month, construction growth was 0.6% in November. manufacturing contracted 0.3%, while services activity rose 0.3%. Production as a whole contracted 0.4%. Worries about the global economy, stoked by an ongoing trade spat between the US and China, have had knock-on effects for other economies, as well as the UK. Figures from Germany and France earlier this week similarly showed falling industrial output. The ONS said the UK economy was returning to moderate growth rates after some volatility earlier in the year, in part related to the weather. The concern that Brexit uncertainty may be weighing on sentiment and spending has become all too familiar. But these GDP numbers suggest there's more to the cooling down of growth toward the end of last year - and worryingly so. They suggest demand from our trading partners is faltering. Industry suffered its most widespread fall in output since 2012, with a drop in car production leading the charge. Separate data showed that, once erratic items like aircraft orders were stripped out, the gulf between imports and exports - the trade deficit - widened  to Â£9.5bn in the three months to November. And we're not alone in feeling the pinch. Germany, France and Spain have released manufacturing figures this week that were unexpectedly grim. From Apple to Jaguar Land Rover, some of the biggest global brands have been blaming faltering overseas demand, particularly from China. for their woes. They may have a point. Growth across our major trading partners is tailing off. It's a timely reminder that, whatever arrangements are in place come the end of March, we may not be able to rely on our economic allies overseas to keep our factories and workshops thriving. Jaguar Land Rover confirms 4,500 job cuts UK economic growth 'stalls' as service sector slides A quick guide to the US-China trade war Commenting on the economic figures Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, said:  ""This marks the manufacturing sector's longest losing run since the 2008-09 recession. ""There are two factors at work here. The global economy looks to be stuttering, with the 'Chimerica' trade war rumbling on, and Chinese consumer spending on a downward trend. ""UK companies are also dealing with a significant Brexit headwind, with heightened levels of uncertainty putting business off investment and damaging consumer confidence.""

"The fatberg in Sidmouth is the largest South West Water has ever discovered A new standard for flushable wet wipes has been announced, amid concerns about sewer-blocking fatbergs, solid masses of fat, wet wipes and grease, which can be hundreds of feet long. Water UK, the industry body, says wipes will need to pass strict tests to gain the approved logo, Fine to Flush. It said wet wipeslabelled flushable do not break downand are behind 93% of blockages in UK sewers. There are some 300,000 sewer blockages each year, costing the country Â£100m. That's according to Water UK. ""This is an important step in the battle against blockages. We've all seen the impact of fatbergs recently, and we want to see fewer of them,"" said Michael Roberts, chief executive, of Water UK. A 210ft (64m) fatberg found near Sidmouth this week is the biggest South West Water (SWW) has found and expected to take about eight weeks to remove. Others have been found, including an 820ft (250m) fatberg weighing 130 tonnes which blocked a Victorian-era sewer in east London in 2017 and took nine weeks to remove. Dead horse among weird items found in sewers Monster fatberg found blocking Sidmouth sewer How do you remove a fatberg - and other questions The Fine to Flush tests,set out in a 30 page document,external, scrutinise whether the wipes are able to clear the u-bend, avoid snagging and avoid chemical residues. The tests are being carried out by Swindon-based WRc. Andy Drinkwater, who is in charge of the tests, said one product, from Natracare, will meet the standard. However, Natracare wipes will not initially display the logo as the packaging was ready before the Fine to Flush image was finalised. There are seven or so other products being tested by WRc at the moment, Mr Drinkwater said. Testing each product can cost up to Â£8,000, he added.

Britain's Andy Murray says he plans to retire after this year's Wimbledon but fears next week's Australian Open could be the final tournament of his career. The three-time Grand Slam winner, who is struggling to recover from hip surgery, was in tears at a news conference in Melbourne on Friday. ""I'm not sure I'm able to play through the pain for another four or five months,"" said the 31-year-old Scot. ""I want to get to Wimbledon and stop but I'm not certain I can do that."" However, Murray says he still intends to play his Australian Open first-round match against Spanish 22nd seed Roberto Bautista Agut next week. Murray posted a picture with his mum Judy on Instagram later on Friday The former world number one had surgery on his right hip last January and has played 14 matches since returning to the sport last June. Murray ended his 2018 season in September to spend time working withrehabilitation expert Bill Knowlesbut still looked short of the required level when he played world number one Novak Djokovic in an open practice match at Melbourne Park on Thursday. In his news conference - during which he left the room to compose himself before returning - Murray said: ""I'm not feeling good, I've been struggling for a long time. ""I've been in a lot of pain for about 20 months now. I've pretty much done everything I could to try and get my hip feeling better and it hasn't helped loads. ""I'm in a better place than I was six months ago but I'm still in a lot of pain. I can still play to a level, but not a level I have played at.""

He told the world's media of the agonising pain he is in when playing and says further hip surgery might be needed to ensure he has a better quality of life in retirement. ""The pain is too much really,"" said Murray, who is also atwo-time Olympic champion.""I need to have an end point because I'm playing with no idea of when the pain will stop. ""I'd like to play until Wimbledon - that's where I'd like to stop playing - but I'm not certain I'm able to do that."" Speaking to BBC Sport, he added: ""A second surgery is an option. I wouldn't be taking the option to have a surgery to resurface and replace my hip with the view to playing at the highest level again. The number one reason to have something so serious is improve your quality of life and being in less pain. ""Athletes have had operations like that done and come back to play - but certainly not in tennis and in singles. ""If I do that I'm not sure I will be competing again."" Murray, who wasknighted in the Queen's New Year Honours listat the end of 2016, also ruled out becoming a doubles player in the future, ending the possibility of him teaming up with older brother Jamie in the twilight of his career.

Asked a simple opening question of how he was feeling, an emotional Murray struggled to get an answer of ""not great"" out before covering his face with his cap and sobbing underneath. Murray has often showed his emotion on court but this was different. This was raw emotion in a place where players - and indeed sport stars generally - don't like to show their true feelings in front of the world's media. A sombre silence filled the room after Murray temporarily left - before he returned, a little more composed, and managed to tell us more.

Despite his fragile state, he still managed to fulfil his media duties and there was even evidence of his dry wit coming out as he was interviewed by television crews after the main news conference. But a cracking voice was never far away as he discussed the pain in his hip and in his mind as he contemplated his future. And when his media duties were done, the tears flowed again between him and coach Jamie Delgado as they shared an embrace in a media centre corridor.

"Amber Rudd made her first major welfare speech on Friday Universal credit payments will go directly to a household's main carer in a move which is expected to help more women, Amber Rudd has announced. The work and pensions secretary alsoconfirmed she would delay asking MPsto allow the transfer of three million people on to the new system until 2020. And she scrapped plans to extend a two-child benefits cap to families with children born before 2017. Ms Rudd said she wanted universal credit to be compassionate and fair. Shadow work and pensions secretary Margaret Greenwood said: ""Universal credit is clearly failing and the government should stop the rollout now."" Amber Rudd's speech in London,came as four single mothers wona High Court challenge over the way payments are calculated. When asked about the court ruling, Ms Rudd said her department would be coming forward with a response. Reality Check: What's the problem with universal credit? Single mums win universal credit challenge Universal Credit: Will benefit changes affect you? Will the changes help you? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external By Michael Buchanan, BBC social affairs correspondent This speech was billed as a reset of universal credit, a clear acknowledgment from Amber Rudd that further tinkering with the troubled reform will no longer do. The last two budgets have seen billions spent trying to reduce the problems that have become ever-more obvious, from increasing use of food banks to private landlords refusing to take people on universal credit. But this speech demonstrates that Ms Rudd believes a more fundamental assessment of the benefit is needed. That makes her the first work and pensions secretary since Iain Duncan Smith to try to take responsibility for welfare reform rather than simply managing the existing system. She will need to convince the Treasury in particular to back her judgement. Speaking in south London, Ms Rudd insisted that the system would still be fully rolled out by 2023 - but added she would consider the findings from a pilot due to run in 2019. Concerning changes to benefit recipients, Ms Rudd said she recognised claims by charities that the current one payment per household system ""penalises women"". Advocacy groups such asRefuge,externalandWomen's Aid,externalhave argued that the system can mean victims of domestic violence are denied access to benefits by their partners. Ms Rudd said: ""Women can never be truly free until they have economic independence"". ""That is why I am committed to ensuring that household payments go directly to the main carer, who is usually - but not always - the woman."" She said 60% of payments already go to the woman's bank account but she was looking at ways to ensure the primary recipient of the benefit is the main carer. This video can not be played Universal credit: Is the government's benefit system working? Ms Rudd also suggested that the longstanding benefit freeze - which was introduced in 2016 - could finish, saying ""it should come to an end"" in 2020. And she said her department would build an online system for private landlords so they can request for rent to be paid directly to them. Ms Rudd argued this would give landlords ""greater certainty"" that rent would be paid, and make it easier for tenants in the private sector to keep their homes. Currently just 5% of private landlords who are paid through universal credit receive the rental payment directly from government. The minister also said she had asked Job Centre Plus to test how payments to claimants could be made more frequently. She added that once this had been piloted, frequent payments could be made available ""more widely so those in genuine need can take it up more easily"". BBC political correspondent Ross Hawkins said Ms Rudd also remained under pressure to shorten a five-week wait before new universal credit claims are paid. Ms Rudd's changes only protect families with children born before April 2017. For families where the third child is born after April 2017, the changes have no effect and the impacts the chart is showing still hold Universal credit merges six older benefits into one new one, and is being introduced gradually across the UK. Instead of applying for lots of different payments, for different things, one payment is calculated based on all of someone's circumstances, like: â¢             being unemployed â¢             working on a low income â¢             needing help with housing costs â¢             having children â¢             having an illness or disability It can be claimed by people both in and out of work. How much someone in work claiming universal credit receives each month is based on how much they earned in the previous month. And unlike with some old benefits, there's no limit to the hours someone can work per week and still claim. But as they earn more, their benefit payment reduces gradually. This is designed to mean ""work always pays"" - that is, in theory someone never loses more in benefits than they have gained through taking extra hours of work. Some households will receive less money from universal credit than they would have done under the old system, while others will receive more. This is partly down to the intentional design of the system and partly a side-effect of cuts that have been made as the benefit was introduced. On the two-child limit, Ms Rudd said it was ""not right"" for it to apply to those who had their children before the cap was announced. ""These parents made decisions about the size of the family when the previous system was the only system in place,"" she said. The""child element"" of universal credit varies,,externalbut is worth at least Â£231.67 a child per month. The Child Poverty Action Group said the decision was ""fantastically good news"", but said the two-child cap should be scrapped for all future families too. Labour also called for the cap to be removed, stressing the change ""does not go far enough"". Leading economic research group the Institute for Fiscal Studies said the announcement ""makes no difference to the long-run generosity of the benefit system"". ""Eventually all children will be born after April 2017, and so the two-child limit will apply to all families with more than two children."" But the IFS added: ""What this reform does do is to slow down substantially the speed of the rollout of the policy - its long-run impact will now not be fully felt until the mid-2030s."" Ms Rudd, who became work and pensions secretary in November, accepted there were problems with universal credit, and promised to ""learn from errors"" and ""adjust"" the system after taking expert guidance. Her predecessor Esther McVey had already announced changes to ensure claimants were given more time to switch to the benefit and would not have to wait so long for their money. The system had been the target of complaints that it was forcing some claimants into destitution and even prostitution. This video can not be played Struggling with universal credit in Hartlepool However, Ms Rudd defended universal credit as ""a force for good"", adding that ""it pumps much needed fresh air into a failing system"". ""As a nation, I believe we all want a decent safety net: if you're facing a difficult moment in life, the state should be there to help you. ""But it is vital that people are supported by this safety net, not trapped beneath it."" Will the U-turn help you? Or will you and your family still be subject to the cap?

"This video can not be played Rosamund, Ella's mother, says she wants to help other families with children who are affected The family of a nine-year-old girl who died from asthma has been given permission to apply for a fresh inquest into her death. It comes after the government's chief lawyer heard new evidence her death could be linked to unlawful levels of air pollution. Ella Kissi-Debrah lived close to one of London's busiest roads. Her mother said she wanted to get to the bottom of the health impact of air pollution on young people. Mrs Adoo-Kissi-Debrah, a teacher, said: ""It's the right decision. Hopefully if we are successful, national government, local government and individuals have to do something about cleaning up the air. ""In two weeks time, Ella would have been 15 years old. This is not going to bring her back, but it will allow us to make sense of why a child who was extremely healthy suddenly got so ill, and focus awareness on what is now a public health crisis. ""It is unacceptable that children in Britain today die from asthma.  We need serious measures to clean up the air like diesel scrappage, better public transport and more cycle lanes,"" she told the WATO programme on Radio 4. Lawyers acting for the family said it was a ""hugely important"" step. Air pollution has never previously been officially recorded on an individual's death certificate. In August, Ella's mother delivered a 100,000-signature petition to Attorney General Geoffrey Cox calling for a new inquest into her daughter's death. He said: ""I have concluded that there is new evidence which may alter the substantial truth of Ella's death. ""I am therefore able to give my permission for an application to the High Court to request a new inquest, based on the evidential test being met."" Ella's lung collapsed in 2011 Ella lived in Lewisham, south London, 25m (80ft) from the South Circular road - a notorious pollution ""hotspot"". She died in February 2013 after experiencing three years of seizures. During that time, local air pollution levels regularly breached EU legal limits. Her last fatal seizure happened during a spike in air pollution levels. An inquest in 2014 found she had died of acute respiratory failure and severe asthma. However, the attorney general's decision has now paved the way for a new inquest to determine whether ""unlawfully high levels of air pollution"" were partially the cause of her death. Human rights lawyer Jocelyn Cockburn, from the firm Hodge Jones and Allen, is acting on behalf of the family. She described the decision as ""hugely strong"" and said the implications went far beyond Ella's case. Ella with her twin brothers ""A wider inquest would look not just at what happened to Ella and the circumstances into her death, but what steps were taken and what lessons can be learned. To look at the wider implications for children's health in that area,"" Ms Cockburn said. ""For me, this case gives an opportunity for those people in public office for protecting our health, to be asked questions and to be held to account and to come up with solutions so we can move towards cleaning up the air as quickly as possible."" One of the grounds for calling a fresh inquest was that permitting illegal levels of air pollution was a potential breach of human rights under Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights - which protects the right to life. Ms Cockburn said: ""A new inquest could mean that a wide range of ""interested parties"" could be called to give evidence. This could include the local authority, the Mayor of London along with the local NHS Trust and Defra."" Ella with flowers after celebrating five years with performing arts school Jigsaw The attorney general's decision followed a report by Prof Stephen Holgate, a leading expert on asthma and air pollution, which found there was a ""striking association"" between Ella's emergency hospital admissions and recorded spikes in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and PM10s, the most noxious pollutants. His report said there was a ""real prospect that without unlawful levels of air pollution, Ella would not have died"". Ella often walked to school along the South Circular Road and Lewisham High Street, a journey that would take 30 to 40 minutes. Or she would be driven and have to sit for lengthy periods in traffic jams. She was first taken to hospital in 2010 after a coughing fit that followed a spike in air pollution levels. She was subsequently admitted to hospital 27 times over three years. Many of these coincided with recorded peaks in air pollution. Her mother said she had resuscitated Ella between 20 and 30 times while waiting for an ambulance. She said that Ella had been treated in five separate hospitals but no medical professional had ever explained that air pollution could be making her asthma worse. The next legal step is for the application to be taken to the High Court, which will decide whether it is ""desirable or necessary"" to have a fresh inquest. While the High Court has the final say, it is highly unusual for the court to disagree with the attorney general. According to Ms Cockburn, decisions made by the attorney general are ""arguably unchallengeable"".

Shirley's family have criticised the film, saying it is filled with ""lies""; co-writer anddirector Peter Farrelly has apologisedafter an old interview surfaced in which he talked about flashing his genitals; and Mortensen has said sorry for using the N word in an interview. The latest controversy comes after the re-emergence of the tweet Vallelonga sent following a rally in November 2015, where Mr Trump - then a presidential candidate - said: ""I watched in Jersey City, New Jersey, where thousands and thousands of people were cheering as that building was coming down."" Vallelonga wrote: ""100% correct. Muslims in Jersey City cheering when towers went down. I saw it, as you did, possibly on local CBS news."" Nick Vallelonga (left), Viggo Mortensen (centre) and Brian Currie attended the National Board of Review Awards There has never been any evidence,externalto support Mr Trump's claim that ""thousands"" celebrated after the attacks in 2001. A clip has emerged of a WCBS correspondent,externalat the time reporting that police found eight men celebrating in one building in New Jersey, but it did not show footage of the men. In a statement reported byHollywood Reporter,external,Variety,externaland other sites, Vallelonga said: ""I want to apologise. I spent my life trying to bring this story of overcoming differences and finding common ground to the screen, and I am incredibly sorry to everyone associated with Green Book. ""I especially deeply apologise to the brilliant and kind Mahershala Ali, and all members of the Muslim faith, for the hurt I have caused. I am also sorry to my late father who changed so much from Dr Shirley's friendship and I promise this lesson is not lost on me. ""Green Book is a story about love, acceptance and overcoming barriers, and I will do better."" Participant Media, which produced the film, also released a statement saying: ""We find Mr Vallelonga's Twitter post offensive, dangerous, and antithetical to Participant Media's values. We reject it in no uncertain terms."" La La Land producer Jordan Horowitz was among those criticising the writer on Twitter, calling his comments ""too disgusting"". Allow Twitter content?

Buku voiced her support for her dad's alleged victims and explained why she waited to speak out about the claims, saying they had been hard to come to terms with. ""It has been very difficult to process it all,"" she wrote in a text-heavy Instagram Story. ""Let alone gather all the right words to express everything I feel."" The documentary Surviving R. Kelly - shown on the US channel Lifetime - exposes detailed accounts of his alleged physical and emotional abuse of women. It claims that the R&B singer allegedly ran an ""abusive cult"" in which he is accused of keeping women captive, against their wills. The programme includes a number of interviews, including with singer John Legend who emphasised he believes the women. Buku said to her 23,600 Instagram followers that she prayed for all the women that say they have been affected by her father's alleged actions. She said she didn't want to talk about her personal life on social media, but because of the intense scrutiny that her father and family were now under, she felt the time was right. ""The same monster you are all confronting me about is my father. I am well aware of who and what he is. I grew up in that house. ""My choice to not speak on him and what he does is for my peace of mind. My emotional state. And for my healing."" Buku signed off the post, saying that she was grateful for everyone's support.

"Flybe is being bought for Â£2.2m by a consortium including Virgin Atlantic and Stobart Group. It will operate under the Virgin Atlantic brand, marking a return by Virgin to domestic flights, followinga failed attempt five years ago. Based in Exeter, Flybe carries around eight million passengers a year from airports such as Southampton, Cardiff and Aberdeen, to the UK and Europe. The deal needs shareholder approval, but is already backed by the board. The move comes after Flybe's profitswarning in October. Shareholders in Flybe will receive just 1p a share and the consortium, which also includes venture capital firm Cyrus, will inject Â£100m. Christine OurmiÃ¨res-Widener, Flybe's chief executive, said the industry has been suffering from higher fuel costs, currency fluctuations and ""significant uncertainties"" presented by Brexit. ""We have been affected by all of these factors which have put pressure on short-term financial performance,"" she said. To support the on-going operations of the airline, the consortium, known as Connect Airways, will initially lend Â£20m to Flybe. A further Â£80m will be invested in Flybe, which describes itself as Europe's largest regional airline. Connect Airways will also buy Stobart Group's regional airline and aircraft leasing business. The group said it would ""create a fully-fledged UK network carrier"" - an opportunity for Virgin, which currently focuses on long-haul, to expand in the UK. Sir Richard's last attempt to launch a regional UK airline failed Virgin, founded by Sir Richard Branson,abandoned attempts to run domestic flights in 2014 through its Little Red airline. Virgin Atlantic is now a joint venture with Delta Airlines. Warwick Brady, chief executive of Stobart Group, said it would also be an opportunity to get more passengers to fly from Southend airport, which it owns, along with Carlisle airport. John Strickland, director at JLS Consulting, said: ""It's still a difficult part of the airline market to operate in. The regional segment is the hardest, because it is short flights where passengers are price sensitive and there's competition with rail and road."" But getting a big cash injection should help the financial performance of Flybe and maintain routes, he said. The 1p-a-share offer is well below the 295p at which they were floated in 2010 and the levels around 30p at which they were trading before October's profits warning.

"Simon Moores was one of the UK's few banner-flying pilots Two men have been killed in a light aircraft crash in mountains in Spain. Pilots Simon Moores, from Westgate on Sea, and David Hockings, of Herstmonceux, were flying from Portugal to Kent on Wednesday. The Piper single-engine aircraft, owned by Mr Hockings, had been due to make a stopover in northern Spain. Spanish rescuers said two bodies were recovered from Hernio mountain in the Basque region. Mr Moores - the brother of Bake Off judge Paul Hollywood's estranged wife, Alex - was one of the few aerial banner pilots in the UK. The 62-year-old former Thanet District Council Conservative councillor tweeted pictures from the air Wednesday. Mr Hockings, 67, ran an aircraft maintenance company called Cristal Air based at Spilsted Farm airfield at Sedlescombe, near Hastings. Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played Just why has the US government partially shut down? US President Donald Trump has renewed a threat to declare a national emergency to fund the construction of a wall on the Mexican border. A row with Democrats over funding the wall has left the government partially shut down for 20 days, leaving some 800,000 federal employees unpaid. On Saturday, the shutdown becomes the longest in US history. Mr Trump says the wall, a key campaign pledge, is needed to tackle a security crisis of illegal immigration. The Democrats say the wall is an ""immorality"" and a waste of taxpayers' money. Where do we go from here? US shutdown leaves websites insecure President Trump has refused to sign legislation to fund and reopen the government if it does not include $5.7bn (Â£4.5bn) for the wall. He issued the threat on a visit on Thursday to a border patrol station in McAllen, in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas. He said that if Congress did not approve funding for the wall, he would ""probably... I would almost say definitely"" declare a national emergency to bypass lawmakers. Mr Trump visited the US-Mexico border in Mission, Texas, on Thursday ""I have the absolute right to declare a national emergency,"" he said. In a later interview with Fox News, he doubled down, declaring: ""If we don't make a deal with Congress, most likely I will do that. ""I would actually say I would. I can't imagine any reason why not, because I'm allowed to do it."" ""The law is 100 percent on my side,"" he said. Mr Trump would have the right to undertake such a construction project in times of war and national emergency, usually allocating funds from the department of defence. But bypassing Congress would be hugely controversial, sparking allegations of the overuse of executive powers and it would almost certainly face huge legal challenges. How much of Trump's wall has been built? What border politicians think of Trump's wall How much has shutdown hit US economy? Some US media reports suggest the White House is considering diverting some of the $13.9bn (Â£10.9bn) allocated last year by Congress for disaster relief in such areas as Puerto Rico, Texas and California to pay for the wall. NBC News reported on Thursday thatMr Trump had been briefed on such a plan,externalbut the White House denied it. Analysts say the national emergency move would provide political cover to reopen government while allowing Mr Trump to argue he has done all he can to fulfil his campaign promise. The BBC's David Willis in Washington says that, with no further talks with the Democrats planned, this now seems the most likely option for the president. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, a key Trump ally, said there was no other pathway forward. He was speaking at McAllen station, behind a display of weapons and cash said to have been seized by the border patrol. He was joined by border patrol agents, and relatives of people killed by illegal immigrants. This video can not be played Five questions about Trump's border wall ""If we don't have a barrier... you're not going to be able to solve this problem,"" he said, adding that people faced ""hard work"", ""gruelling problems"" and ""a lot of death"" without it. Mr Trump added: ""They say a wall is medieval... There are some things that work."" The president said in a national address on Tuesday the wall was needed to stem a ""growing humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border"", involving ""thousands of illegal immigrants"". He pointed to illegal drug supplies, people trafficking and criminal acts by illegal immigrants in the US. The Democrats say the wall is ""ineffective"" and ""unnecessary"" and an expensive bill to taxpayers that the president had said Mexico would foot. Speaking on Thursday, Mr Trump said he never meant that Mexico would make a one-time payment for the wall. Is there a crisis on the US-Mexico border? ""When I said Mexico would pay for the wall in front of thousands and thousands of people... obviously I never meant Mexico would write a cheque,"" he said. Mr Trump alongside a display of weapons, drugs and cash reportedly seized by US border patrol However, this is contradicted byan archived campaign memo,externalfrom 2016, where Mr Trump outlined how he planned to ""compel Mexico to make a one-time payment"" of $5-10bn (Â£4bn-Â£8bn) for the wall. Mr Trump said on Thursday that, instead of a direct payment, Mexico would be ""paying for the wall indirectly, many, many times over"", under a new trade deal between the US, Mexico and Canada. Economists have disputed this and critics say that any savings incurred due to the deal would go directly to private businesses rather than flow into US Treasury. Partial shutdowns occur when Congress cannot agree a budget by a certain deadline or the president refuses to sign it. Can Trump use emergency powers to build wall? Six surprising statistics about immigrants in the US Fourteen ways the US shutdown is hurting This shutdown, which began on 22 December, has closed 25% of the government. Of the 800,000 federal employees affected, about 350,000 are furloughed - a kind of temporary lay off - and the rest are working without pay. This video can not be played US shutdown: 'My son wants to sell art to pay our bills' The first pay day since the shutdown falls on Friday and will pass without workers getting salaries. They include prison guards, airport security screening staff, and members of the FBI. Some affected federal workers who spoke to the BBC said they had resorted to a number of measures, including taking other jobs, racking up credit card bills, tapping into savings or taking on loans at high interest rates to pay their bills. Thousands have also applied for unemployment benefits.

"This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt tells Today that no Brexit is 'in sight' and blames the Speaker John Bercow Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has warned the UK faces ""Brexit paralysis"" if MPs reject Theresa May's EU deal. He said two Commons defeats this week showed Parliament was ""committed one way or another to try to stop no-deal"". But that would risk ""no Brexit"", he argued, which would be a ""breach of trust"" with the public. Tory rebel Dominic Grieve said it was the duty of MPs to ""stop people committing national suicide"" by going ahead with a no-deal Brexit. He told a rally of supporters of another referendum in London that while the prime minister had done her best in negotiating the deal to honour the referendum result, while minimising the damage, the ""unpleasant truth"" was that ""it can satisfy no-one"". ""There is only one way out,"" he said. ""When the prime minister's deal is defeated, what else can we possibly offer to the British public which has any coherence at all but to go back and ask them to reconsider their decision?"" This video can not be played Grieve: No-deal Brexit would be 'national suicide' Mr Grieve, who tabled the amendment that led to a government defeat on Wednesday, has been at the forefront of cross-party efforts to ensure MPs have a say in what happens if Mrs May's deal is rejected. The prime minister is widely expected to lose next Tuesday's vote on the withdrawal deal negotiated between the UK and the EU - with more than 100 Conservative MPs and the DUP, which usually support the Conservatives in Commons votes, among those set to vote against it. Labour will also oppose the deal but leader Jeremy Corbyn has resisted growing calls from within his own party to get behind another EU referendum, insisting a general election is still his top priority if the deal is rejected. ""We're going to get smashed"" - one government insider's apocalyptic prediction about one of the most important votes in recent political history. As things stand, MPs are on course to kybosh Theresa May's long-argued-over Brexit deal, with a very heavy defeat. Dozens of her own backbenchers have said publicly they will vote against it. The opposition parties are adamant they will say ""no"" too. Read more from Laura Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Hunt said it was clear the Parliamentary arithmetic was ""challenging"". LIVE: MPs continue Brexit debate Laura Kuenssberg: What could change Brexit vote dynamics? May calls union chiefs over Brexit deal World against no-deal Brexit - Japan PM ""We have a government that is committed to delivering Brexit, but it doesn't have a majority and we have seen this week that there is a Speaker who is willing to frustrate the government at every opportunity."" Commons Speaker John Bercow has been accused of bias by some Tory MPs over his decision to break with Parliamentary precedent by allowing a vote on Dominic Grieve's amendment to a government motion, which handed MPs more control over the Brexit process. Mr Bercow said he was acting in the interests of MPs and had made an ""honest judgement"". In a shift of tone, apparently aimed at winning over Brexiteers who are determined to vote Mrs May's deal down, Foreign Secretary Mr Hunt also warned that defeat for the government on Tuesday would not lead to them getting the kind of Brexit they wanted - and could lead to Britain staying in the EU. ""If this deal is rejected, ultimately what we may end up with is not a different type of Brexit but Brexit paralysis. ""And Brexit paralysis ultimately could lead to no Brexit. ""I'm saying this would be (an) incredibly damaging breach of trust and it would also be very bad for Britain's reputation abroad, having decided to leave the EU, if we in the end for whatever reasons found we weren't able to do it."" A ""no-deal"" Brexit is where the UK would cut ties with the European Union overnight without a transition period. Theresa May's government, and many others, believe this would be hugely damaging and want a more gradual withdrawal. But if Parliament can't agree on that, and nothing else takes its place, the UK could still leave without a deal. This would mean the UK would not have to obey EU rules. Instead, it would need to follow World Trade Organization terms on trade. Many businesses would see new taxes on imports, exports and services, which are likely to increase their operating costs. That means the prices of some goods in UK shops could go up. The UK would also lose the trade agreements it had with other countries as a member of the EU, all of which would need to be renegotiated alongside the new agreement with the EU itself. Manufacturers in the UK expect to face delays in components coming across the border. The UK would be free to set its own immigration controls. However some UK professionals working in the EU and UK expats could face uncertainty. Some countries, such as Spain, Germany and the Netherlands, have given temporary guarantees about residency status and rights, but there is not yet an agreed policy for UK citizens across the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The situation for holidays and business trips is a little clearer, as the European Commission has said that even in a no-deal scenario, UK travellers won't need a visa for short visits of up to 90 days. The border between Northern Ireland and the Irish republic would become an external frontier for the EU with customs and immigration controls, though how and where any checks would be made is not clear. Some Leave supporters think that leaving without a deal would be positive if the right preparations were made. They say criticism is scaremongering and any short term pain would be for long term gain. But critics - including both Brexit supporters and opponents - say that leaving without a deal would be a disaster for the UK: driving up food prices, leading to shortages of goods and gridlock on some roads in the South East resulting from extra border checks. He acknowledged that MPs opposed to Brexit were flexing their muscles, telling Today: ""After this week the idea that Parliament is going to do nothing at all is highly unlikely."" But he rejected the idea of holding a series of votes to find out what kind of Brexit MPs would support, as some have suggested, claiming there was no consensus for any alternative to Mrs May's plan. ""Everyone's had a crack at what they thought was their top outcome but we are all democrats and we have a responsibility to deliver the outcome the British people voted for."" The PM's deal was ""not perfect"" but it did ""broadly deliver Brexit"", despite arguments about the Irish backstop, he added, and urged MPs to ""come together"" to back it.

Ahead of a speech on Friday announcing the changes, she also signalled a benefit freeze introduced in 2016 might not be renewed when it comes to an end next year. ""It was the right policy at the time... I look forward to it coming off,"" she told Sky News. Universal credit is a benefit for working-age people, replacing six benefits and merging them into one payment: income support income-based jobseeker's allowance income-related employment and support allowance housing benefit child tax credit working tax credit It was designed to make claiming benefits simpler, and is being introduced in stages across the UK. Confirming she would delay asking MPs to authorise the transfer of three million people from the old benefits system, she told Today: ""We have listened to people. We know they want more individual assistance either with getting payments more regularly or having payments made direct to landlords."" ""These elements, which could help universal credit work more helpfully for individuals receiving it, are what I'm going to be changing."" She also said she wanted to ensure that the main carer in a household would be the primary recipient of universal credit. On the two-child limit, she will say in her speech later that it was ""not right"" for it to apply to those who had their children before the cap was announced. ""These parents made decisions about the size of the family when the previous system was the only system in place,"" she will say. The""child element"" of universal credit varies,,externalbut is worth at least Â£231.67 a child per month. Ms Rudd, who became work and pensions secretary in November, accepted there were problems with universal credit, and promised to ""learn from errors"" and ""adjust"" the system after taking expert guidance. Her predecessor Esther McVey had already announced changes to ensure claimants were given more time to switch to the benefit and would not have to wait so long for their money. The system had been the target of complaints that it was forcing some claimants into destitution and even prostitution. This video can not be played Struggling with universal credit in Hartlepool Ms Rudd will defend the introduction of the benefit by saying: ""Universal credit is working for the vast majority of people. ""As a nation, I believe we all want a decent safety net: if you're facing a difficult moment in life, the state should be there to help you. ""But it is vital that people are supported by this safety net, not trapped beneath it."" Shadow work and pensions secretary Margaret Greenwood said the government should abandon the two-child limit in its entirety. ""Universal credit is clearly failing and the government should stop the roll out now,"" she said. Former Labour MP Frank Field, who chairs the work and pensions committee, said: ""I strongly welcome the secretary of state's decision not to press ahead with what could have been the cruellest benefit cut in history. ""At the eleventh hour, she has prevented thousands of children from being plunged into poverty by an unjustifiable retrospective policy."" By Michael Buchanan, BBC social affairs correspondent This speech is billed as a reset of universal credit, a clear acknowledgment from Amber Rudd that further tinkering with the troubled reform will no longer do. The last two budgets have seen billions spent trying to reduce the problems that have become ever-more obvious, from increasing use of food banks to private landlords refusing to take people on universal credit. But this speech demonstrates that Amber Rudd believes a more fundamental assessment of the benefit is needed. That makes her the first work and pensions secretary since Iain Duncan Smith to try to take responsibility for welfare reform rather than simply managing the existing system. She will need to convince the Treasury in particular to back her judgement. Single mums win universal credit challenge How are universal credit rules changing?

Buku voiced her support for her dad's alleged victims and explained why she waited to speak out about the claims, saying they had been hard to come to terms with. ""It has been very difficult to process it all,"" she wrote in a text-heavy Instagram Story. ""Let alone gather all the right words to express everything I feel."" The documentary Surviving R. Kelly - shown on the US channel Lifetime - exposes detailed accounts of his alleged physical and emotional abuse of women.

Buku said to her 23,600 Instagram followers that she prayed for all the women that say they have been affected by her father's alleged actions. She said she didn't want to talk about her personal life on social media, but because of the intense scrutiny that her father and family were now under, she felt the time was right. ""The same monster you are all confronting me about is my father. I am well aware of who and what he is. I grew up in that house. ""My choice to not speak on him and what he does is for my peace of mind. My emotional state. And for my healing."" Buku signed off the post, saying that she was grateful for everyone's support.

"Snake catchers in Australia have rescued a carpet python which was found covered in hundreds of ticks. The reptile, which was believed to be ill and was coated in the parasites, was lying in a backyard swimming pool on the Gold Coast in Queensland. A professional handler removed the snake and took it for treatment at a wildlife clinic. Vets removed more than 500 ticks, snake catcher Tony Harrison told the BBC, and it is expected to recover. Gold Coast and Brisbane Snake Catchers worker Mr Harrison said he believed the snake, which has been given the name Nike, had been trying to drown the ticks in the pool. ""Obviously, [the snake] was extremely uncomfortable,"" he said. ""Its whole face was swollen and blooming and it was completely overwhelmed by the ticks breeding on him.""

"The women say the ""rigid"" system has left them unable to make ends meet (illustrated by models) Four working single mothers have won a High Court challenge over the government's universal credit scheme. They argued a ""fundamental problem"" with the system meant their monthly payments varied ""enormously"", leaving them out of pocket and struggling financially. Lawyers for the women said the problem was likely to affect ""tens of thousands of people"" claiming the benefit. A DWP spokesman said: ""We are carefully considering the court's judgement."" It comes as Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd announceda raft of changes to the government's flagship scheme. She also confirmed she would delay asking Parliament to authorise the transfer of three million people on to universal credit until next year, after a pilot of the transfer from existing benefits has been completed. Universal credit is a means-tested benefit, rolling six separate benefits into one payment. It has proved controversial almost from its inception, with reports of IT issues, massive overspends, administrative problems and delays to the scheme's rollout. What is universal credit? Universal Credit: Will benefit changes affect you? On Friday, it was announced that Danielle Johnson, Claire Woods, Erin Barrett and Katie Stewart had succeeded in a judicial review action against the government over the method used to calculate payments. It followed a hearing in November when the court was told the women were struggling financially,with some falling into debt or relying on food banks. Tessa Gregory, a solicitor from law firm Leigh Day, who represented part-time dinner lady Danielle Johnson from Keighley, West Yorkshire, said her client was ""a hard-working single mum"" and ""precisely the kind of person universal credit was supposed to help"". But Ms Gregory said the ""rigid income assessment system"" had left her Â£500 out of pocket over the year and spiralling into debt. Solicitor Carla Clarke, of the Child Poverty Action Group, which also brought the case on behalf of the mothers, said the universal credit system was ""out of step with both actual reality and the law"", and had caused them ""untold hardship, stress and misery"". This video can not be played Universal credit: Is the government's benefit system working? When calculating universal credit, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) sets assessment periods for each person to look at how much they earn - from the 1st of the month to the end of the month, for example. But lawyers for the mothers said a problem arises when claimants are paid by employers on a date which ""clashes"" with their assessment period. For example, they pointed out that if a claimant is paid early because of a weekend or bank holiday, the system counts them as having been paid twice in one month and they receive a ""vastly reduced"" universal credit payment. By Michael Buchanan, BBC social affairs correspondent This is an important and potentially hugely expensive decision. The barrister for the DWP told the High Court in November that if they lost the case it would cost them hundreds of millions of pounds to change the system. Leaked documents that I saw in October showed officials discussing the problem but concluding that ""there is nothing we can do to mitigate this issue"". At the heart of the problem is a design fault with universal credit that cuts the entitlement of tens of thousands of claimants each month, sometimes by hundreds of pounds. The court's decision was published just minutes before Amber Rudd started her speech today, billed as a reset of the beleaguered benefit. She didn't mention this particular problem, but it highlights that Ms Rudd's remarks can only be the starting point in dealing with Universal Credit's ongoing problems. Universal credit merges six older benefits into one new one, and is being introduced gradually across the UK. Instead of applying for lots of different payments, for different things, one payment is calculated based on all of someone's circumstances, like: â¢             being unemployed â¢             working on a low income â¢             needing help with housing costs â¢             having children â¢             having an illness or disability It can be claimed by people both in and out of work. How much someone in work claiming universal credit receives each month is based on how much they earned in the previous month. And unlike with some old benefits, there's no limit to the hours someone can work per week and still claim. But as they earn more, their benefit payment reduces gradually. This is designed to mean ""work always pays"" - that is, in theory someone never loses more in benefits than they have gained through taking extra hours of work. Some households will receive less money from universal credit than they would have done under the old system, while others will receive more. This is partly down to the intentional design of the system and partly a side-effect of cuts that have been made as the benefit was introduced. The two judges in London concluded the work and pensions secretary had ""wrongly interpreted"" the relevant regulations. Ms Gregory called for Ms Rudd to take ""immediate steps to ensure that no other claimants are adversely affected"" and ""ensure all those who have suffered because of this unlawful conduct are swiftly and fairly compensated"". The leader of the trade union Unison, Dave Prentis, also called for the government to ""compensate those who have lost out substantially"". Shadow work and pensions secretary Margaret Greenwood said the High Court's ruling ""confirms once again that universal credit is failing people on low pay"", and called for a stop to the rollout. Rebecca Smidmore told the BBC she felt ""made to feel bad"" for claiming benefits Rebecca Smidmore, a carer for her 10-year-old son who has spina bifida, said her family's universal credit payments vary hugely each month - for example, if her husband gets paid a day or two early when payday falls at a weekend. ""They then think he's been paid twice in a month and universal credit is then altered,"" she said. ""So some months we get a really low amount, some months we get a really high amount."" She said universal credit had a ""massive impact really early on"" and makes budgeting difficult, adding: ""It's as if we are made to feel bad that we are claiming this benefit, that we don't deserve this money"". Meanwhile,speaking to the BBC's Newsnight's political editorNicholas Watt, Ms Rudd announced she favoured calls to change the way people who are on universal credit, but starting to go back to work, are taxed. Ms Rudd told the programme: ""I would like every incentive we can find to make sure that people going back into work realise that it is the best thing for them and that they don't get a huge 90% tax rate."" Earlier on Friday, Ms Rudd promised to make the universal credit system more ""individual"" and tailor it to claimants needs, for example by making payments more regular. Changeswill also see more money go directly to womenwho are the ""main carer"" in a family, in response to criticism that the ""one payment per household"" system penalised women. Charities have argued a whole family's benefit payments often go to the man's account and women, particularly victims of domestic violence, have little or no access to it. Ms Rudd also announced a U-turn on plans to extend a benefits cap on families with more than two children. The cap will no longer apply to about 15,000 families, who had their children before the two-child limit was introduced in 2017.

""The first couple of tunes he released - Party Here and Hands - were some of the most futuristic, forward thinking, raw and inspiring tunes to come out of the UK in the last two years."" However, the star has not had an easy route to fame, spending most of his teenage years homeless after being thrown out of school and, later, his family home. ""A year ago I was poor, I had no money,"" he told the BBC. ""But I was never depressed. I was never in the mode to give up. Around me it was bad, but I kept motivated.""

Fret was out in the Santurce neighbourhood of San Juan at 5:30 local time (9:30 GMT) on Thursday when he was fatally shot. He was taken to a nearby hospital, where he was declared dead. Police are now searching for another man on a motorcycle who was with Fret when he was found, but quickly fled the scene. There is no immediate indication of a motive, and an investigation is under way.

"Jayme Closs, 13, has been described as a ""sweet girl"" by school officials A 13-year-old girl from Wisconsin who went missing in October after her parents were murdered has been found alive, officials say. Jayme Closs, whose parents were shot dead in their family home last year, was located on Thursday evening, police said. They said a suspect believed to be linked to the case was now in custody. Jayme reportedly escaped from a rural home near Gordon, Wisconsin, and was found bedraggled by residents. Jayme Closs: What we know so far ""We promised to bring Jayme home and tonight we get to fulfil that promise,"",externala police statement said. No other details were given but police are due to hold a press briefing later on Friday. Nothing official has been said but some details have emerged on local media. KARE-TV said Jayme was found in a small development with few residents about six miles (10km) east of Gordon. The Minneapolis Star Tribune quoted a teacher,externalat a local school as saying a neighbour walking her dog had knocked on her door after having found Jayme. The teacher said Jayme was skinny, dirty and wearing shoes too large for her feet. ""This is Jayme Closs! Call 911!"" the neighbour told the teacher, according to the Star Tribune. Jayme stayed at the teacher's home for about 20 minutes and declined food and water, Associated Press reports. The Star Tribune quoted a local sheriff as saying the suspect was arrested minutes later and that Jayme was taken to hospital. On 15 October last year, emergency services received a call from the family's home in Barron. They heard a disturbance in the background but no-one spoke to them directly. When police arrived four minutes later, James and Denise Closs were found dead at the scene. No gun or suspects were found and there was no sign of Jayme. The following Wednesday, their deaths were ruled as homicide by a medical examiner. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"The mothers claim single parents are being disproportionately hit by the system (picture illustrated by models) A single mum who relies on universal credit is challenging the government's benefits scheme for being ""irrational"". Danielle Johnson, 25, from West Yorkshire, said: ""I have never been this financially unstable before."" With three other single mums, she is claiming in the High Court that the benefit disproportionately affects single parents - most of them women. But an official in charge of it told the court it would cost ""hundreds of millions of pounds"" to re-design. Neil Couling, from the Department for Work and Pensions, said the system relied heavily on automation to process claims, and that less than 1% of claimants lost out as a result of the problem. The single mum who can't afford to work 'Universal Credit forced me into sex work' Watch: What's the benefit? Universal credit is a means-tested benefit, rolling six separate benefits into one payment. It has proved controversialalmost from its inception, with reports of IT issues, massive overspends, administrative problems and delays to the scheme's roll-out. Lawyers acting for the women will now argue there is a ""fundamental problem"" with universal credit, telling the court it discriminates against single parents and undermines government legislation - where the new benefit system was meant to encourage people into work. The DWP sets assessment periods for each person to look at how much they earn - from the 1st of the month to the end of the month, for example. The department then calculates how much benefit they are entitled to by how much they are paid in that time. Ms Johnson, like many employees, is paid on the last working day of the month and relies on universal credit to top up her income. If she is paid on 31st of one month and the 31st of the next, she is assessed as being paid her salary once a month and her universal credit is calculated correctly. But her lawyers argue that if she is paid on the 31st and the next month her payment day is a few days early - due to the last day falling on a weekend or Bank Holiday - her universal credit assessment shows she has been paid twice in a month. For example: In August, the last working day of the month was Friday 31st, so she would be paid as normal In September, the last working day of the month was Friday 28th, as the 30th fell on a Sunday Under the assessment period of universal credit, this would show her as being paid twice in a one month This assessment, essentially doubling what she earns in one month in the eyes of the DWP, would see her benefit entitlement reduced. The amount of universal credit a person gets gradually reduces as they earn more, but working parents are entitled to get what is called a ""work allowance"" of Â£198. This means the benefit you are entitled to is calculated on what you earn after that Â£198 - much like the personal tax allowance, where you don't have to pay tax on the first Â£11,850 you earn. The allowance is paid once in each universal credit assessment period. So, for Ms Johnson, she would get Â£198 for a month where her assessment shows she has been paid twice, but not get it the next month, as she has not been paid for work in that assessment period. Ms Johnson's lawyers, Leigh Day, said the system left her Â£500-a-year worse off and she struggled to budget in months when she received no benefit because of the way the system operated. Ms Johnson said: ""I'm doing my best working part-time to make ends meet so that I can look after my daughter. ""I have never been this financially unstable before, to the point of being unable to afford my rent and having to go into my overdraft when buying food. ""It is getting me into a vicious cycle of debt,"" she said. Claire Woods, another single mum involved in the case, said wildly fluctuating income from month to month has forced her to turn down a promotion, use a food bank and incur debts. In a previous job working for a county council, Ms Woods was paid at the end of every month which would clash with her universal credit assessment period. As a result, she lost money, could not meet her monthly outgoings and lived with the anxiety of a fluctuating income. When the council offered her a promotion, she knew the payment clash would remain, so did not take it up. ""I had to go to a food bank and I took out an advance that I am still paying back,"" she said. ""I took two jobs - as a PA and a waitress -  which I could do without the education I invested in, but which had paydays which don't clash with my assessment period. ""I invested Â£40,000 in higher education studies so that I could become an occupational therapist and it's great that I've got my degree but I have had to put my career hopes on hold because of universal credit."" Universal Credit- 'I've been left behind' Universal Credit: Will benefit changes affect you? Erin Barrett, who works as a healthcare assistant at a local hospital, said the problems with the benefit had led to spiralling debts. ""Life would be more manageable if I didn't work,"" she said. ""But I've always worked and so I want to work."" The fourth woman in the case, mum-of-one Katie Stewart, said she had to give up work due to the problems created by the system. Child Poverty Action Group's solicitor Carla Clarke, who is representing Ms Woods, Ms Barrett and Ms Stewart, said: ""Our clients have been left repeatedly without money for family essentials simply because of the date of their paydays. ""This is a fundamental defect in universal credit and an injustice to hard-working parents and their children that must be put right for our clients and everyone else affected."" A DWP spokesman said he could not comment on an ongoing legal case. But on universal credit, he said: ""Universal credit adjusts automatically to people's earnings so if someone's earnings are higher one month their universal credit payment decreases, but they may receive an increased universal credit amount the following month. ""People can see how much universal credit is due to be paid into their account online, and budget support is available to those who need it."" The two-day hearing is under way at the Royal Courts of Justice. Judges are not expected to make a judgment until later in the year. Universal Credit: Will benefit changes affect you?

"This video can not be played Just why has the US government partially shut down? US President Donald Trump has renewed a threat to declare a national emergency to fund the construction of a wall on the Mexican border. A row with Democrats over funding the wall has left the government partially shut down for 20 days, leaving some 800,000 federal employees unpaid. On Saturday, the shutdown becomes the longest in US history. Mr Trump says the wall, a key campaign pledge, is needed to tackle a security crisis of illegal immigration. The Democrats say the wall is an ""immorality"" and a waste of taxpayers' money. Where do we go from here? US shutdown leaves websites insecure President Trump has refused to sign legislation to fund and reopen the government if it does not include $5.7bn (Â£4.5bn) for the wall. He issued the threat on a visit on Thursday to a border patrol station in McAllen, in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas. He said that if Congress did not approve funding for the wall, he would ""probably... I would almost say definitely"" declare a national emergency to bypass lawmakers. Mr Trump visited the US-Mexico border in Mission, Texas, on Thursday ""I have the absolute right to declare a national emergency,"" he said. In a later interview with Fox News, he doubled down, declaring: ""If we don't make a deal with Congress, most likely I will do that. ""I would actually say I would. I can't imagine any reason why not, because I'm allowed to do it."" ""The law is 100 percent on my side,"" he said. Mr Trump would have the right to undertake such a construction project in times of war and national emergency, usually allocating funds from the department of defence. But bypassing Congress would be hugely controversial, sparking allegations of the overuse of executive powers and it would almost certainly face huge legal challenges. How much of Trump's wall has been built? What border politicians think of Trump's wall How much has shutdown hit US economy? Some US media reports suggest the White House is considering diverting some of the $13.9bn (Â£10.9bn) allocated last year by Congress for disaster relief in such areas as Puerto Rico, Texas and California to pay for the wall. NBC News reported on Thursday thatMr Trump had been briefed on such a plan,externalbut the White House denied it. Analysts say the national emergency move would provide political cover to reopen government while allowing Mr Trump to argue he has done all he can to fulfil his campaign promise. The BBC's David Willis in Washington says that, with no further talks with the Democrats planned, this now seems the most likely option for the president. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, a key Trump ally, said there was no other pathway forward. He was speaking at McAllen station, behind a display of weapons and cash said to have been seized by the border patrol. He was joined by border patrol agents, and relatives of people killed by illegal immigrants. This video can not be played Five questions about Trump's border wall ""If we don't have a barrier... you're not going to be able to solve this problem,"" he said, adding that people faced ""hard work"", ""gruelling problems"" and ""a lot of death"" without it. Mr Trump added: ""They say a wall is medieval... There are some things that work."" The president said in a national address on Tuesday the wall was needed to stem a ""growing humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border"", involving ""thousands of illegal immigrants"". He pointed to illegal drug supplies, people trafficking and criminal acts by illegal immigrants in the US. The Democrats say the wall is ""ineffective"" and ""unnecessary"" and an expensive bill to taxpayers that the president had said Mexico would foot. Speaking on Thursday, Mr Trump said he never meant that Mexico would make a one-time payment for the wall. Is there a crisis on the US-Mexico border? ""When I said Mexico would pay for the wall in front of thousands and thousands of people... obviously I never meant Mexico would write a cheque,"" he said. Mr Trump alongside a display of weapons, drugs and cash reportedly seized by US border patrol However, this is contradicted byan archived campaign memo,externalfrom 2016, where Mr Trump outlined how he planned to ""compel Mexico to make a one-time payment"" of $5-10bn (Â£4bn-Â£8bn) for the wall. Mr Trump said on Thursday that, instead of a direct payment, Mexico would be ""paying for the wall indirectly, many, many times over"", under a new trade deal between the US, Mexico and Canada. Economists have disputed this and critics say that any savings incurred due to the deal would go directly to private businesses rather than flow into US Treasury. Partial shutdowns occur when Congress cannot agree a budget by a certain deadline or the president refuses to sign it. Can Trump use emergency powers to build wall? Six surprising statistics about immigrants in the US Fourteen ways the US shutdown is hurting This shutdown, which began on 22 December, has closed 25% of the government. Of the 800,000 federal employees affected, about 350,000 are furloughed - a kind of temporary lay off - and the rest are working without pay. This video can not be played US shutdown: 'My son wants to sell art to pay our bills' The first pay day since the shutdown falls on Friday and will pass without workers getting salaries. They include prison guards, airport security screening staff, and members of the FBI. Some affected federal workers who spoke to the BBC said they had resorted to a number of measures, including taking other jobs, racking up credit card bills, tapping into savings or taking on loans at high interest rates to pay their bills. Thousands have also applied for unemployment benefits.

"Flybe is being bought for Â£2.2m by a consortium including Virgin Atlantic and Stobart Group. It will operate under the Virgin Atlantic brand, marking a return by Virgin to domestic flights, followinga failed attempt five years ago. Based in Exeter, Flybe carries around eight million passengers a year from airports such as Southampton, Cardiff and Aberdeen, to the UK and Europe. The deal needs shareholder approval, but is already backed by the board. The move comes after Flybe's profitswarning in October. Shareholders in Flybe will receive just 1p a share and the consortium, which also includes venture capital firm Cyrus, will inject Â£100m. Christine OurmiÃ¨res-Widener, Flybe's chief executive, said the industry has been suffering from higher fuel costs, currency fluctuations and ""significant uncertainties"" presented by Brexit. ""We have been affected by all of these factors which have put pressure on short-term financial performance,"" she said. To support the on-going operations of the airline, the consortium, known as Connect Airways, will initially lend Â£20m to Flybe. A further Â£80m will be invested in Flybe, which describes itself as Europe's largest regional airline. Connect Airways will also buy Stobart Group's regional airline and aircraft leasing business. The group said it would ""create a fully-fledged UK network carrier"" - an opportunity for Virgin, which currently focuses on long-haul, to expand in the UK. Sir Richard's last attempt to launch a regional UK airline failed Virgin, founded by Sir Richard Branson,abandoned attempts to run domestic flights in 2014 through its Little Red airline. Virgin Atlantic is now a joint venture with Delta Airlines. Warwick Brady, chief executive of Stobart Group, said it would also be an opportunity to get more passengers to fly from Southend airport, which it owns, along with Carlisle airport. John Strickland, director at JLS Consulting, said: ""It's still a difficult part of the airline market to operate in. The regional segment is the hardest, because it is short flights where passengers are price sensitive and there's competition with rail and road."" But getting a big cash injection should help the financial performance of Flybe and maintain routes, he said. The 1p-a-share offer is well below the 295p at which they were floated in 2010 and the levels around 30p at which they were trading before October's profits warning.

"Schools are facing a ""marked deterioration"" in their finances, an analysis says Almost a third of local authority secondary schools in England are unable to cover their costs, a study suggests. The Education Policy Institute says its research shows the proportion of such schools with budgets in the red has almost quadrupled in four years. And the average local authority secondary school debt is Â£483,000. But the Department for Education says that across all types of state schools, more than 90% are in surplus. Former Education Minister David Laws, who chairs the Education Policy Institute (EPI), said the latest school budget figures, for 2017-18, showed a ""marked deterioration"". Head teachers' leader Geoff Barton said the study showed funding levels were ""unsustainable"" and many schools were now facing a ""financial cliff edge"". Mr Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, warned that without adequate funding for schools, ""educational standards will deteriorate"". There are particular problems in secondary schools, the EPI says, with about one in 10 local authority secondary schools having funding shortfalls of more than 10% of their income. Mr Laws said the government should prioritise supporting schools facing such ""excessive"" funding difficulties. The think tank says it is difficult to establish directly comparable figures for individual academies that are part of multi-academy trusts but 50% of secondary academies have in-year deficits. School funding 'exaggerated' and 'misrepresented' by ministers, says statistics watchdog DFE caught adding students' tuition fees to school spending claims What does funding pressure mean? Secondary school with 300 holes in its roof The report also highlights the unevenness of funding levels. And while there are rising numbers of schools struggling with budget problems, there are also many with surpluses, worth in total about Â£1.8bn and including Â£250m not earmarked for any expenditure. But the National Education Union says that funding is not keeping pace with rising cost pressures - and that since 2015 the school system has 326,000 more pupils. There has been a sustained campaign over school funding by the WorthLess? grassroots group of head teachers. Thousands of head teachers held a school-funding protest in Westminster West Sussex head teacher Jules White, the group's leader, said there were widespread concerns over school funding shortages among the 7,000 head teachers supporting the campaign. They have complained ofhaving to ask parents for contributionsand have cast doubt on what the government says about school budgets. Mr White accused the Department for Education and the Treasury of ""hiding behind slogans"" while schools were ""sliding into greater and greater debt"". He said that even though schools were reporting worsening finances they were ""being asked to prop up all manner of other social care and support services"". ""The notion that head teachers are sitting on pile of cash whilst making awful cuts to their school service and to teacher numbers is fanciful,"" said the school funding campaigner. Labour's shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, said the ""number of schools in deficit is skyrocketing"" but the government was ""refusing to accept that this is creating a crisis"". While the figures show the financial problems in secondary schools, there are fewer primary schools facing such debts. And the Department for Education says that the overall picture across the state school sector is more positive. ""The report itself shows 94% of academy trusts and almost 90% of local authority maintained schools are reporting a cumulative surplus or breaking even - and, 45% of maintained schools have even been able to increase the level of their cumulative surplus in 2017-18,"" a Department for Education spokesman said. ""While the core schools and high-needs budget is rising from almost Â£41bn in 2017-18 to Â£43.5bn by 2019-20, we do recognise the budgeting challenges schools face. ""That is why the education secretary has set out his determination to work with the sector to help schools reduce the Â£10bn they spend on non-staffing costs and ensure every pound is spent as effectively as possible to give children a great education.""

"Snake catchers in Australia have rescued a carpet python which was found covered in hundreds of ticks. The reptile, which was believed to be ill and was coated in the parasites, was lying in a backyard swimming pool on the Gold Coast in Queensland. A professional handler removed the snake and took it for treatment at a wildlife clinic. Vets removed more than 500 ticks, snake catcher Tony Harrison told the BBC, and it is expected to recover. Gold Coast and Brisbane Snake Catchers worker Mr Harrison said he believed the snake, which has been given the name Nike, had been trying to drown the ticks in the pool. ""Obviously, [the snake] was extremely uncomfortable,"" he said. ""Its whole face was swollen and blooming and it was completely overwhelmed by the ticks breeding on him."" He said removing the tick-laden snake had felt like ""holding a bag of marbles that were moving under my hands"". Snakes often pick up small numbers of ticks or other parasites in the wild, said Associate Prof Bryan Fry from the University of Queensland. Venomous snake turns up in lunchbox Animals suffer through Australian heat Animals that can survive being eaten However the presence of such a large number of ticks indicated that the snake was likely to have an underlying illness, he said, possibly be due to heat stress or drought conditions. ""Clearly it was a seriously unwell animal to have had its natural defences so broken down,"" Associate Prof Fry said. ""I doubt it would have survived if it hadn't been taken out and gotten treatment."" Mr Harrison later shared that Nike was suffering from an infection, though he was now ""doing well"". ""Nike is a bit more sprightly today,"" said Mr Harrison in a video shared on theGold Coast and Brisbane Snake Catcher's Facebook page,external.

"There has been a small spike in the number of people crossing the Channel in small boats in recent months People seeking asylum in the UK should take a lie detector test as part of their application, the former chief of UK immigration enforcement says. Abuse of the asylum system is ""rife"" and it is being used by economic migrants, according to David Wood. In a report, he said new technology would help spot ""signs of deception"". It comes after Home Secretary Sajid Javidquestioned whethersome migrants crossing the Channel were genuine asylum seekers. There has been a small spike in crossings to Britain in recent months, and in December Mr Javid declared the increase a ""major incident"". The Home Office said it is not considering using lie detectors in asylum cases. Reality Check: How many people seek asylum in the UK? Reality Check: Who rescues migrants in the Channel? Asylum seeker who fled DR Congo released Mr Wood was the deputy chief executive of the Border Agency and later the director general of immigration and enforcement at the Home Office, before retiring in 2015. He wrote the report - published on Friday - for independent think tank Civitas: Institute for the Study of Civil Society. In the report, he says the current system is being used to ""facilitate economic migration"" - with up to 15,000 asylum applications every year from people who ultimately have no valid claim. He suggests one way of distinguishing genuine refugees from others would be to use automated technology to screen applications. The 20-minute screening technology - which the report says has accuracy rates of 90% - would highlight ""questionable"" answers, so interviewers can ""focus on those areas"". ""It would not be about proving that the applicant is lying, but about being reasonably confident that they are telling the truth,"" he adds. Former immigration enforcement chief David Wood left the Home Office in 2015 ""That could save a lot of time, enabling caseworkers to get to the truth more quickly."" The Home Office - which said it is not considering using lie detectors - said its staff are ""rigorously trained"" to make consistent and high-quality decisions. What became of the man stuck in an airport? Refugees have so much to teach us Asylum seeker 'children' found to be adults By Danny Shaw, BBC home affairs correspondent Many people will baulk at the idea of using technology to determine whether asylum seekers are telling the truth or not. Thousands of those who arrive on our shores every year have fled appalling abuse and persecution - and in some cases torture. It would be heartless and cruel, the argument goes, to require them to submit to a mechanical process of lie detection. But polygraph testing is widely used, mainly by law enforcement, in other countries - and since 2014 it's been deployed by probation officers in England and Wales to determine whether convicted sex offenders are complying with their licence conditions. It would be a major step for that to be extended to the asylum system - but the debate has started. If someone wants to stay in the UK as a refugee, they must have left their country and be unable to go back because of a fear of persecution,the government says.,external They should apply when they arrive in the UK or as soon as they think it would be unsafe to return to their home country. After they have made an application, they will go to a ""screening"" - a meeting with an immigration officer - where they will be asked why they want asylum. Following that, they will undergo an interview during which they are asked to explain and show evidence of how they were persecuted in their home country and why they are afraid to go back. A decision will usually be made within six months, the government says. UK and France to step up Channel patrols Are migrant 'pushbacks' in the Channel legal?

"Kevin Fret's music video Soy Asi has more than half a million views on YouTube The rapper and outspoken advocate for the LGBT community Kevin Fret has been shot dead in Puerto Rico aged 24. The musician, described as Latin Trap music's first openly gay artist, was killed in the capital San Juan on Thursday morning, police said. Fret was shot at eight times while riding a motorbike in the street, and he was hit in the head and hip. His death brings the number of murders in Puerto Rico this year to 22, police added. Rapper Smoke Dawg killed in shooting Rapper XXXTentacion shot dead in Florida Do urban rap videos glamorise violence? Confirming his death, Fret's manager Eduardo Rodriguez said: ""There are no words that describe the feeling we have and the pain that causes us to know that a person with so many dreams has to go. ""We must all unite in these difficult times, and ask for much peace for our beloved Puerto Rico."" Fret was out in the Santurce neighbourhood of San Juan at 5:30 local time (9:30 GMT) on Thursday when he was fatally shot. He was taken to a nearby hospital, where he was declared dead. Police are now searching for another man on a motorcycle who was with Fret when he was found, but quickly fled the scene. There is no immediate indication of a motive, and an investigation is under way. Puerto Rico has seen a rise in street crime in recent weeks, which has been described by police on the Caribbean island as a ""crisis of violence"". The Puerto Rican was a rising trap artist in the Latin trap scene, and his debut music video, Soy Asi (I'm Like This), has more than half a million views on YouTube. Mr Rodriguez described the rapper as ""an artistic soul"" who had a passion for music. ""He still had a lot left to do."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""I'm a person that doesn't care what anybody has to say,"",externalFret told online magazine Paper last year. ""[Now I see] young gay guys or young lesbians that are looking at me now like a role model, like wow, if he did it, and he don't care what anybody else has to say, I can do it."" However, Fret's rise to prominence was not without turbulence - while living in Miami last year, he was charged with battery after a fight, media reported. He said he had been attacked because of his sexuality, and threw a metal bottle at the man. Fret has also responded strongly to homophobic threats in the lyrics of a rival musician, making some of his supporters wonder whether his murder was motivated by hate. Trap is a style of Southern hip hop, popularised in the late 90s and early 00s. It is characterised by its use of multilayered energetic and hard-hitting sounds, and overall dark atmosphere. The word ""trap"" refers to where drug deals happen, and the lyrics, which are both sung and rapped, often reflect the poverty, violence and street life that artists have faced. The Latin variant of the genre gained popularity in the Caribbean in the 2010s, and is typically sung in Spanish. It mixes American trap, rhythm and blues and local sounds like Puerto Rican reggaeton. Well-known Latin trap rappers like Bad Bunny, Messiah and Ozuna have collaborated with mainstream hip hop artists like Drake and Cardi B.

"This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt tells Today that no Brexit is 'in sight' and blames the Speaker John Bercow Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has warned the UK faces ""Brexit paralysis"" if MPs reject Theresa May's EU deal. He said two Commons defeats this week showed Parliament was ""committed one way or another to try to stop no-deal"". But that would risk ""no Brexit"", he argued, which would be a ""breach of trust"" with the public. Tory rebel Dominic Grieve said it was the duty of MPs to ""stop people committing national suicide"" by going ahead with a no-deal Brexit. He told a rally of supporters of another referendum in London that while the prime minister had done her best in negotiating the deal to honour the referendum result, while minimising the damage, the ""unpleasant truth"" was that ""it can satisfy no-one"". ""There is only one way out,"" he said. ""When the prime minister's deal is defeated, what else can we possibly offer to the British public which has any coherence at all but to go back and ask them to reconsider their decision?"" This video can not be played Grieve: No-deal Brexit would be 'national suicide' Mr Grieve, who tabled the amendment that led to a government defeat on Wednesday, has been at the forefront of cross-party efforts to ensure MPs have a say in what happens if Mrs May's deal is rejected. The prime minister is widely expected to lose next Tuesday's vote on the withdrawal deal negotiated between the UK and the EU - with more than 100 Conservative MPs and the DUP, which usually support the Conservatives in Commons votes, among those set to vote against it. Labour will also oppose the deal but leader Jeremy Corbyn has resisted growing calls from within his own party to get behind another EU referendum, insisting a general election is still his top priority if the deal is rejected. ""We're going to get smashed"" - one government insider's apocalyptic prediction about one of the most important votes in recent political history. As things stand, MPs are on course to kybosh Theresa May's long-argued-over Brexit deal, with a very heavy defeat. Dozens of her own backbenchers have said publicly they will vote against it. The opposition parties are adamant they will say ""no"" too.

LIVE: MPs continue Brexit debate Laura Kuenssberg: What could change Brexit vote dynamics? May calls union chiefs over Brexit deal World against no-deal Brexit - Japan PM ""We have a government that is committed to delivering Brexit, but it doesn't have a majority and we have seen this week that there is a Speaker who is willing to frustrate the government at every opportunity."" Commons Speaker John Bercow has been accused of bias by some Tory MPs over his decision to break with Parliamentary precedent by allowing a vote on Dominic Grieve's amendment to a government motion, which handed MPs more control over the Brexit process. Mr Bercow said he was acting in the interests of MPs and had made an ""honest judgement"". In a shift of tone, apparently aimed at winning over Brexiteers who are determined to vote Mrs May's deal down, Foreign Secretary Mr Hunt also warned that defeat for the government on Tuesday would not lead to them getting the kind of Brexit they wanted - and could lead to Britain staying in the EU. ""If this deal is rejected, ultimately what we may end up with is not a different type of Brexit but Brexit paralysis. ""And Brexit paralysis ultimately could lead to no Brexit. ""I'm saying this would be (an) incredibly damaging breach of trust and it would also be very bad for Britain's reputation abroad, having decided to leave the EU, if we in the end for whatever reasons found we weren't able to do it."" A ""no-deal"" Brexit is where the UK would cut ties with the European Union overnight without a transition period. Theresa May's government, and many others, believe this would be hugely damaging and want a more gradual withdrawal. But if Parliament can't agree on that, and nothing else takes its place, the UK could still leave without a deal. This would mean the UK would not have to obey EU rules. Instead, it would need to follow World Trade Organization terms on trade. Many businesses would see new taxes on imports, exports and services, which are likely to increase their operating costs. That means the prices of some goods in UK shops could go up. The UK would also lose the trade agreements it had with other countries as a member of the EU, all of which would need to be renegotiated alongside the new agreement with the EU itself. Manufacturers in the UK expect to face delays in components coming across the border. The UK would be free to set its own immigration controls. However some UK professionals working in the EU and UK expats could face uncertainty. Some countries, such as Spain, Germany and the Netherlands, have given temporary guarantees about residency status and rights, but there is not yet an agreed policy for UK citizens across the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The situation for holidays and business trips is a little clearer, as the European Commission has said that even in a no-deal scenario, UK travellers won't need a visa for short visits of up to 90 days. The border between Northern Ireland and the Irish republic would become an external frontier for the EU with customs and immigration controls, though how and where any checks would be made is not clear. Some Leave supporters think that leaving without a deal would be positive if the right preparations were made. They say criticism is scaremongering and any short term pain would be for long term gain. But critics - including both Brexit supporters and opponents - say that leaving without a deal would be a disaster for the UK: driving up food prices, leading to shortages of goods and gridlock on some roads in the South East resulting from extra border checks. He acknowledged that MPs opposed to Brexit were flexing their muscles, telling Today: ""After this week the idea that Parliament is going to do nothing at all is highly unlikely."" But he rejected the idea of holding a series of votes to find out what kind of Brexit MPs would support, as some have suggested, claiming there was no consensus for any alternative to Mrs May's plan. ""Everyone's had a crack at what they thought was their top outcome but we are all democrats and we have a responsibility to deliver the outcome the British people voted for."" The PM's deal was ""not perfect"" but it did ""broadly deliver Brexit"", despite arguments about the Irish backstop, he added, and urged MPs to ""come together"" to back it.

"Snake catchers in Australia have rescued a carpet python which was found covered in hundreds of ticks. The reptile, which was believed to be ill and was coated in the parasites, was lying in a backyard swimming pool on the Gold Coast in Queensland. A professional handler removed the snake and took it for treatment at a wildlife clinic. Vets removed more than 500 ticks, snake catcher Tony Harrison told the BBC, and it is expected to recover. Gold Coast and Brisbane Snake Catchers worker Mr Harrison said he believed the snake, which has been given the name Nike, had been trying to drown the ticks in the pool. ""Obviously, [the snake] was extremely uncomfortable,"" he said. ""Its whole face was swollen and blooming and it was completely overwhelmed by the ticks breeding on him."" He said removing the tick-laden snake had felt like ""holding a bag of marbles that were moving under my hands"". Snakes often pick up small numbers of ticks or other parasites in the wild, said Associate Prof Bryan Fry from the University of Queensland. Venomous snake turns up in lunchbox Animals suffer through Australian heat Animals that can survive being eaten However the presence of such a large number of ticks indicated that the snake was likely to have an underlying illness, he said, possibly be due to heat stress or drought conditions. ""Clearly it was a seriously unwell animal to have had its natural defences so broken down,"" Associate Prof Fry said. ""I doubt it would have survived if it hadn't been taken out and gotten treatment."" Mr Harrison later shared that Nike was suffering from an infection, though he was now ""doing well"". ""Nike is a bit more sprightly today,"" said Mr Harrison in a video shared on theGold Coast and Brisbane Snake Catcher's Facebook page,external.

"This video can not be played Andy Murray was in tears as he told journalists next week's Australian Open could be his last tournament Australian Open 2019 Venue:Melbourne ParkDates:14-27 January Coverage:Daily live commentaries on the BBC Sport website, listen to Tennis Breakfast daily from 07:00 GMT on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra and watch highlights on BBC TV and online from 19 January. Britain's Andy Murray says he plans to retire after this year's Wimbledon but fears next week's Australian Open could be the final tournament of his career. The three-time Grand Slam winner, who is struggling to recover from hip surgery, was in tears at a news conference in Melbourne on Friday. ""I'm not sure I'm able to play through the pain for another four or five months,"" said the 31-year-old Scot. ""I want to get to Wimbledon and stop but I'm not certain I can do that."" However, Murray says he still intends to play his Australian Open first-round match against Spanish 22nd seed Roberto Bautista Agut next week. Murray posted a picture with his mum Judy on Instagram later on Friday The former world number one had surgery on his right hip last January and has played 14 matches since returning to the sport last June. Murray ended his 2018 season in September to spend time working withrehabilitation expert Bill Knowlesbut still looked short of the required level when he played world number one Novak Djokovic in an open practice match at Melbourne Park on Thursday. In his news conference - during which he left the room to compose himself before returning - Murray said: ""I'm not feeling good, I've been struggling for a long time. ""I've been in a lot of pain for about 20 months now. I've pretty much done everything I could to try and get my hip feeling better and it hasn't helped loads. ""I'm in a better place than I was six months ago but I'm still in a lot of pain. I can still play to a level, but not a level I have played at."" Oh-so-nears, tears & triumphs - how Murray helped create golden period for British sport The moment Murray knew the game was up Murray 'a champion on and off court' - US legend King leads tributes 'Scots look at Murray and are proud he is one of them' Andy Murray: A career in 10 pictures Murray was frank in his assessment of his abilities, conceding he is no longer able to perform to the level at which he won the US Open in 2012 and Wimbledon in 2013 and 2016. He told the world's media of the agonising pain he is in when playing and says further hip surgery might be needed to ensure he has a better quality of life in retirement. ""The pain is too much really,"" said Murray, who is also atwo-time Olympic champion.""I need to have an end point because I'm playing with no idea of when the pain will stop. ""I'd like to play until Wimbledon - that's where I'd like to stop playing - but I'm not certain I'm able to do that."" Speaking to BBC Sport, he added: ""A second surgery is an option. I wouldn't be taking the option to have a surgery to resurface and replace my hip with the view to playing at the highest level again. The number one reason to have something so serious is improve your quality of life and being in less pain. ""Athletes have had operations like that done and come back to play - but certainly not in tennis and in singles. ""If I do that I'm not sure I will be competing again."" Murray, who wasknighted in the Queen's New Year Honours listat the end of 2016, also ruled out becoming a doubles player in the future, ending the possibility of him teaming up with older brother Jamie in the twilight of his career. Archive video: When Murray was a 14-year-old star of the future Britain's Norrie reaches first ATP final Dart to play Sharapova in Australian Open first round This video can not be played The moment GB won the Davis Cup BBC Sport's Jonathan Jurejko in Melbourne From the moment Andy Murray walked into the news conference at Melbourne Park, you felt a sense that something wasn't quite right. Asked a simple opening question of how he was feeling, an emotional Murray struggled to get an answer of ""not great"" out before covering his face with his cap and sobbing underneath. Murray has often showed his emotion on court but this was different. This was raw emotion in a place where players - and indeed sport stars generally - don't like to show their true feelings in front of the world's media. A sombre silence filled the room after Murray temporarily left - before he returned, a little more composed, and managed to tell us more. Seven times Murray made us laugh, cry & just feel proud Transcript: Murray news conference in full Newsround: Murray's most memorable moments - in pictures Reaction to Murray's announcement The toils of the past four months - going to Philadelphia to work with rehab expert Bill Knowles and realising he still can't reach the required physical level which brought him three Grand Slam titles, plus perhaps the harsh reality of being unable to compete with Novak Djokovic in a practice session here on Thursday - have hit Murray. Despite his fragile state, he still managed to fulfil his media duties and there was even evidence of his dry wit coming out as he was interviewed by television crews after the main news conference. But a cracking voice was never far away as he discussed the pain in his hip and in his mind as he contemplated his future. And when his media duties were done, the tears flowed again between him and coach Jamie Delgado as they shared an embrace in a media centre corridor.

The UK is set to leave the European Union on 29 March. The withdrawal agreement between the UK and EU - covering things like the ""divorce bill"", expat citizens' rights and a 20-month transition period - will only come into force if MPs back it in a vote. A no-deal Brexit would see the UK leave without a withdrawal agreement and start trading with the EU on the basis of World Trade Organization rules, an outcome favoured by some Brexiteers. The deal negotiated between the UK and EU looks set to be rejected by MPs next Tuesday, with 110 Conservative MPs having said they will oppose it, Labour set to vote against it and Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn calling for a general election ""at the earliest opportunity"" - should it be voted down. ""A government that cannot get its business through the House of Commons is no government at all,"" he said. ""We're going to get smashed"" - one government insider's apocalyptic prediction about one of the most important votes in recent political history. As things stand, MPs are on course to kybosh Theresa May's long-argued-over Brexit deal, with a very heavy defeat. Dozens of her own backbenchers have said publicly they will vote against it. The opposition parties are adamant they will say ""no"" too. Read more from Laura Mrs May has been speaking to some Labour MPs and the leaders of two of the UK's biggest trade unions, Len McCluskey of Unite and Tim Roache of the GMB, in a bid to try to build support for the deal. It has emerged that the government is considering backing an amendment from Labour Leave supporter John Mann, giving extra protections to workers and the environment, in a bid to win support. Speaking alongside Prime Minister Abe, Mrs May repeated her call to MPs to support her plan in next Tuesday's crunch vote, saying: ""The only way to avoid no deal is to have a deal and to agree a deal, and the deal that is on the table...the EU has made clear, is the only deal."" Corbyn calls for election over Brexit Japan to scrap UK beef and lamb ban She said the deal allowed for a ""more ambitious trading arrangement between the European Union and the United Kingdom than they have entered into with any other third country"" which would also allow the UK to ""strike good trade deals on our own with countries around the world, like Japan"". Labour MP Martin Whitfield, a supporter of the Best for Britain campaign for another referendum, said: ""It is humiliating for the prime minster to be told to her face that the whole world wants to avoid a no-deal scenario, yet she still refuses to rule it out. ""Countries across the globe are looking at Britain in despair. Japan, like our other allies, understands the folly of a no-deal Brexit. Why doesn't Theresa May?"" Meanwhile, during the second of five days of debate on the deal, Conservative MP George Freeman has told MPs he will now vote for it ""with a heavy heart"", having previously said he could not support it. He said it ""wasn't perfect"" but he would back it because ""we are now in the dying stages and no deal is unconscionable"". Trade between the UK and Japan hit Â£28bn last year, and Japanese companies already employ 150,000 people in the UK. During their meeting in Downing Street, Mrs May and Mr Abe also discussed a number of joint projects, including research around conditions such as dementia and heart failure, the increasing use of big data and artificial intelligence, and environmentally friendly growth. They also made commitments on security - such as the UK deploying the Royal Navy warship HMS Montrose to the region to enforce sanctions against North Korea. And as part of a cultural exchange, the National Gallery will send a major exhibition to Japan, including the Sunflowers painting by Vincent Van Gogh.

Asylum seeker who fled DR Congo released Mr Wood was the deputy chief executive of the Border Agency and later the director general of immigration and enforcement at the Home Office, before retiring in 2015. He wrote the report - published on Friday - for independent think tank Civitas: Institute for the Study of Civil Society. In the report, he says the current system is being used to ""facilitate economic migration"" - with up to 15,000 asylum applications every year from people who ultimately have no valid claim. He suggests one way of distinguishing genuine refugees from others would be to use automated technology to screen applications. The 20-minute screening technology - which the report says has accuracy rates of 90% - would highlight ""questionable"" answers, so interviewers can ""focus on those areas"". ""It would not be about proving that the applicant is lying, but about being reasonably confident that they are telling the truth,"" he adds. Former immigration enforcement chief David Wood left the Home Office in 2015 ""That could save a lot of time, enabling caseworkers to get to the truth more quickly."" The Home Office - which said it is not considering using lie detectors - said its staff are ""rigorously trained"" to make consistent and high-quality decisions. What became of the man stuck in an airport? Refugees have so much to teach us Asylum seeker 'children' found to be adults By Danny Shaw, BBC home affairs correspondent Many people will baulk at the idea of using technology to determine whether asylum seekers are telling the truth or not. Thousands of those who arrive on our shores every year have fled appalling abuse and persecution - and in some cases torture. It would be heartless and cruel, the argument goes, to require them to submit to a mechanical process of lie detection. But polygraph testing is widely used, mainly by law enforcement, in other countries - and since 2014 it's been deployed by probation officers in England and Wales to determine whether convicted sex offenders are complying with their licence conditions. It would be a major step for that to be extended to the asylum system - but the debate has started. If someone wants to stay in the UK as a refugee, they must have left their country and be unable to go back because of a fear of persecution,the government says.,external They should apply when they arrive in the UK or as soon as they think it would be unsafe to return to their home country. After they have made an application, they will go to a ""screening"" - a meeting with an immigration officer - where they will be asked why they want asylum. Following that, they will undergo an interview during which they are asked to explain and show evidence of how they were persecuted in their home country and why they are afraid to go back. A decision will usually be made within six months, the government says. UK and France to step up Channel patrols Are migrant 'pushbacks' in the Channel legal?

"This speed camera in Nice, photographed in December, is one example of the damage Members of the ""yellow vests"" protest movement have vandalised almost 60% of France's entire speed camera network, the interior minister has said. Christophe Castaner said the wilful damage was a threat to road safety and put lives in danger. The protest movement began over fuel tax increases, and saw motorists block roads and motorway toll booths. Some protesters feel speed cameras are solely a revenue-generating measure which takes money from the poor. The BBC's Hugh Schofield, in Paris, said evidence of the vandalism is visible to anyone driving around France, with radar cameras covered in paint or black tape to stop them working. But the extent of the damage - now believed to affect more than half of all 3,200 speed cameras in the country's network - was unknown until Mr Castaner's statement on Thursday. He said the devices had been ""neutralised, attacked, or destroyed"" by members of the protest movement. The yellow vests movement, orgilets jaunesin French, is named after the high-visibility vests that every driver in the country must keep in their vehicle. Who are the 'gilets jaunes'? Les gilets jaunes: The full story Speed limits in France were already controversial after the government lowered the limit on many main roads from 90km/h to 80km/h (50mph) early last year. Protesters angry about the increase in fuel taxes complained of the rising costs of a commute for those priced out of living in urban centres - and turned their ire on other costs such as toll roads and speed cameras. This plastic-motorbike combination was spotted in Corsica on 2 December While the number of people attending weekend protests has dropped since the government made some small concessions, the conflict between the popular movement and the government remains a daily topic of debate in France. Just this week,the prime minister announced a crackdown on unsanctioned protests, whilea former boxer filmed punching police officershas divided public opinion, with some claiming he was defending other protesters from police.

"""We're going to get smashed"" - one government insider's apocalyptic prediction about one of the most important votes in recent political history, the big night next Tuesday when MPs give their verdict on the government and the EU's compromise. As things stand, MPs are on course to kybosh Theresa May's long-argued-over Brexit deal, with a very heavy defeat. Dozens of her own backbenchers have said publicly they will vote against it. The opposition parties are adamant they will say ""no"" too. The Tories' supposed partners in government, the DUP, are deeply dug-in to opposing the agreement, for reasons we've discussed plenty of times here. Japan PM: World against no-deal Brexit May calls union leaders over Brexit deal Corbyn calls for election over Brexit And although there are whispers of compromises that might peel off a few rebels here and there and a handful of switchers - like her former policy chief George Freemanwho revealed his change of heart,externalin the Commons and will now back her - there is nothing on the horizon that looks like shifting big numbers. The draft script for Tuesday's drama, therefore, outlines a heavy and embarrassing defeat for the prime minister on her central policy, with nothing and no-one seeming to come to her rescue. Japanese PM Shinzo Abe met Theresa May for talks on Thursday But there are at least two factors that could change the dynamics, quite separate to the chorus of warnings about no deal from members of the Cabinet and outside voices like theJapanese leader Shinzo Abe. First off, with any rebellion it's not a bad rule of thumb to suggest that many of those who have made loud complaints may, in the end, prove to be less brave than they at first appear. It is not unusual for cantankerous politicians to be proven to have had rather a lot of mouth - and rather threadbare trousers. One senior Brexiteer told me they reckoned they had around 40 or 50 critics solid and certain to vote to reject the deal, far fewer than the hundred or so publicly opposed. Parliament seems in such uproar that perhaps the numbers will be as high as the most dire warnings suggest. But don't be surprised when MPs actually have to make a final decision and go through the division lobbies with their deadly rivals, if the scale of the defeat looks rather different. Casting a vote, especially one so vital, is very, very different to criticising a policy. A ""no-deal"" Brexit is where the UK would cut ties with the European Union overnight without a transition period. Theresa May's government, and many others, believe this would be hugely damaging and want a more gradual withdrawal. But if Parliament can't agree on that, and nothing else takes its place, the UK could still leave without a deal. This would mean the UK would not have to obey EU rules. Instead, it would need to follow World Trade Organization terms on trade. Many businesses would see new taxes on imports, exports and services, which are likely to increase their operating costs. That means the prices of some goods in UK shops could go up. The UK would also lose the trade agreements it had with other countries as a member of the EU, all of which would need to be renegotiated alongside the new agreement with the EU itself. Manufacturers in the UK expect to face delays in components coming across the border. The UK would be free to set its own immigration controls. However some UK professionals working in the EU and UK expats could face uncertainty. Some countries, such as Spain, Germany and the Netherlands, have given temporary guarantees about residency status and rights, but there is not yet an agreed policy for UK citizens across the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The situation for holidays and business trips is a little clearer, as the European Commission has said that even in a no-deal scenario, UK travellers won't need a visa for short visits of up to 90 days. The border between Northern Ireland and the Irish republic would become an external frontier for the EU with customs and immigration controls, though how and where any checks would be made is not clear. Some Leave supporters think that leaving without a deal would be positive if the right preparations were made. They say criticism is scaremongering and any short term pain would be for long term gain. But critics - including both Brexit supporters and opponents - say that leaving without a deal would be a disaster for the UK: driving up food prices, leading to shortages of goods and gridlock on some roads in the South East resulting from extra border checks. Second, we're not exactly short these days of twists in Parliamentary drama. And there could be another one next Tuesday. Other tweaks, amendments, might be suggested by MPs, and voted on first. The way this place works, if any of those ideas are approved, that would change what's on the table - maybe a little, maybe a lot. That means, despite the months of rows about the precise terms of the agreement, there might not be a vote on Theresa May's deal in its original form. This could be something relatively minor, although important to some MPs, like the increased environmental protections the PM has discussed with Labour MPs. Or, much bigger, an amendment that kills the deal off altogether. Activists urge Corbyn to back EU referendum Brexit and the timetable for a 'Plan B' Still with me? Politically, what happens with the other ideas backbenchers put forward, before the expected vote on the deal as it stands, might matter enormously. That's because a defeat on the plan as amended, might be much smaller than a defeat on the deal with no changes. For Theresa May's authority, losing by a few dozen, is very different to losing by way over 100. That might, in turn, make it seem much more credible for the prime minister to have another go at getting it through. Will Hilary Benn's amendment go to the vote? And it also will matter who the main architects of the defeat appear to be. Government sources warning of being ""smashed"" in the Commons suggest the best outcome for them is, perversely, losing on an amendment, therefore avoiding a straightforward and overwhelming ""no"" to their deal. Some Brexiteers and some in government believe that that the Labour MP Hilary Benn's suggested change - that would reject the deal, and rule out no deal - could be voted through by MPs, because of support from former Remainers. And a narrow defeat at the hands of Remainers would be a totally different political beast to a heavy, heavy defeat at the hands of Brexiteers in their own party. One well-known member of the Conservative Eurosceptic group the ERG joked: ""We may not even end up being the bad guys - we might not have to rebel."" It's possible that Hilary Benn will pull that particular amendment, with talk of a different ""no deal"" amendment being put forward. And one senior Labour figure suggested the party would do almost anything to make sure that there is a clear vote on the prime minister's proposal and that Parliamentary shenanigans don't get in the way of the Commons giving a definite view, (they expect a total kicking), of Theresa May's plan. But as we head into these next few vital days, the point is that the serious games in the Commons are far from over. And what happens this time next week will be affected by precisely how Tuesday night plays out. In the wake of the likely defeat, Theresa May might make an emergency dash to Brussels, could pivot to a ""plan B"" or a series of emergency cross-party talks. But the actual numbers, the atmosphere once the tellers have actually counted the votes and who walks through which lobby will still shape what she does next.

"Amber Rudd will make her first major welfare speech on Friday About 15,000 families no longer face having their benefits capped after the government performed another U-turn over its flagship universal credit. The work and pensions secretary has ditched plans to extend a benefits cap on families of more than two children. Amber Rudd said those with children born before the system began in 2017 would remain exempt, as she aimed to ensure it was ""compassionate and fair"". The Child Poverty Action Group said the decision was ""fantastically good news"". However, the group is still calling for the two-child cap to be scrapped for all other families. Labour said the change ""does not go far enough"". Reality Check: What's the problem with universal credit? Single mums win universal credit challenge Universal Credit: Will benefit changes affect you? Will the changes help you? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external Ms Rudd alsoconfirmed she would again delay asking MPsto authorise the transfer of three million people from the old benefits system. Instead, the government will run a pilot involving 10,000 people going through the universal credit process. This video can not be played Universal credit: Is the government's benefit system working? BBC political correspondent Ross Hawkins said Ms Rudd also remains under pressure to shorten a five-week wait before new universal credit claims are paid. He added that Ms Rudd may ask the Treasury for more money to implement further modifications, once the pilot scheme is completed. Ms Rudd's changes only protect families with children born before April 2017. For families where the third child is born after April 2017, the changes have no effect and the impacts the chart is showing still hold Ms Rudd told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I'm making a number of changes to our welfare system to make sure that it delivers on the intent which is to be a safety net and also to be a compassionate and fair system helping people into work."" Ahead of a speech on Friday announcing the changes, she also signalled a benefit freeze introduced in 2016 might not be renewed when it comes to an end next year. ""It was the right policy at the time... I look forward to it coming off,"" she told Sky News. Universal credit is a benefit for working-age people, replacing six benefits and merging them into one payment: income support income-based jobseeker's allowance income-related employment and support allowance housing benefit child tax credit working tax credit It was designed to make claiming benefits simpler, and is being introduced in stages across the UK. Confirming she would delay asking MPs to authorise the transfer of three million people from the old benefits system, she told Today: ""We have listened to people. We know they want more individual assistance either with getting payments more regularly or having payments made direct to landlords."" ""These elements, which could help universal credit work more helpfully for individuals receiving it, are what I'm going to be changing."" She also said she wanted to ensure that the main carer in a household would be the primary recipient of universal credit. On the two-child limit, she will say in her speech later that it was ""not right"" for it to apply to those who had their children before the cap was announced. ""These parents made decisions about the size of the family when the previous system was the only system in place,"" she will say. The""child element"" of universal credit varies,,externalbut is worth at least Â£231.67 a child per month. Ms Rudd, who became work and pensions secretary in November, accepted there were problems with universal credit, and promised to ""learn from errors"" and ""adjust"" the system after taking expert guidance. Her predecessor Esther McVey had already announced changes to ensure claimants were given more time to switch to the benefit and would not have to wait so long for their money. The system had been the target of complaints that it was forcing some claimants into destitution and even prostitution. This video can not be played Struggling with universal credit in Hartlepool Ms Rudd will defend the introduction of the benefit by saying: ""Universal credit is working for the vast majority of people. ""As a nation, I believe we all want a decent safety net: if you're facing a difficult moment in life, the state should be there to help you. ""But it is vital that people are supported by this safety net, not trapped beneath it."" Shadow work and pensions secretary Margaret Greenwood said the government should abandon the two-child limit in its entirety. ""Universal credit is clearly failing and the government should stop the roll out now,"" she said. Former Labour MP Frank Field, who chairs the work and pensions committee, said: ""I strongly welcome the secretary of state's decision not to press ahead with what could have been the cruellest benefit cut in history. ""At the eleventh hour, she has prevented thousands of children from being plunged into poverty by an unjustifiable retrospective policy."" By Michael Buchanan, BBC social affairs correspondent This speech is billed as a reset of universal credit, a clear acknowledgment from Amber Rudd that further tinkering with the troubled reform will no longer do. The last two budgets have seen billions spent trying to reduce the problems that have become ever-more obvious, from increasing use of food banks to private landlords refusing to take people on universal credit. But this speech demonstrates that Amber Rudd believes a more fundamental assessment of the benefit is needed. That makes her the first work and pensions secretary since Iain Duncan Smith to try to take responsibility for welfare reform rather than simply managing the existing system. She will need to convince the Treasury in particular to back her judgement. Single mums win universal credit challenge How are universal credit rules changing?

"Sergio Bucher joined Debenhams from Amazon The chief executive of Debenhams has been voted off the retailer's board, but will remain in his role, the troubled retailer has said. Two major shareholders, Mike Ashley's Sports Direct, and Landmark Group, voted against Mr Bucher's re-election. The board said it had ""full confidence"" in plans put in place by Mr Bucher and the management to reshape the business. Chairman Sir Ian Cheshire was also voted off the board and will step down. The vote, at the company's annual general meeting, came just hours after the embattled retailerreported a sharp fall in sales during the crucial Christmas trading period. Sales fell 5.7% in the 18 weeks to 5 January. Like many High Street retailers Debenhams has been hit by a shift to online shopping and rising costs. Last year it issued three profit warnings. It is closing up to 50 of its stores and is seeking new finance. The board said,externalMr Bucher was not re-elected to the board ""principally as a result of the votes of the same two major shareholders"" who voted against Sir Ian - that is, Sports Direct and Landmark Group. However it added: ""Of the votes cast... Sergio received 44.15% votes in favour of his re-election. Excluding those two shareholders, the vote for Sergio to continue on the board was approximately 99.6% in favour."" Debenhams board said it was ""mindful of its responsibilities to all shareholders and has full confidence in Sergio and in the management's plan to boost the business. As a result, it added, the board and Mr Bucher had agreed that he should continue as chief ""reporting to the board"". However, Sir Ian had ""concluded it is no longer possible for him to remain chairman of Debenhams,"" it said. Sir Ian had been on the Debenhams board for two years. Terry Duddy, Debenhams' senior independent director, has been appointed interim chairman. He said: ""I recognise that individual shareholders have wished to register their dissatisfaction. ""I am looking forward to working with Sergio. My first task is to meet with shareholders so that I understand any concerns that they may have."" Mr Ashley, who founded Sports Direct, has been taking an increased interest in Debenhams. Sports Direct already owns nearly 30% of the shares in the department store chain and has offered a further Â£40m investment. Debenhams rejected his offer, but said all options remain open. Earlier on Thursday Mr Bucher said there had been fewer customers visiting the company's stores. He confirmed that Debenhams was in talks with its lenders about its Â£520m credit line.
