"This video can not be played Harry Dunn's parents say they were told by the president he would ""try to push this from a different angle"" Harry Dunn's parents rejected a ""bombshell"" offer from Donald Trump to meet the woman accused of involvement in their son's fatal crash. Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn said they felt ""a little ambushed"" when the president revealed Anne Sacoolas was in the next room at the White House. Mrs Sacoolas returned to the United States under diplomatic immunity days after the crash which killed Harry, 19. Harry's parents said they wanted to meet Mrs Sacoolas, 42, in the UK. Mr Dunn said a White House official told them she would not be returning to the UK, but Mr Trump said he would ""try to push this from a different angle"". Harry Dunn died on 27 August when his motorcycle crashed with a Volvo near RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire. Mrs Sacoolas - who is reportedly married to a US intelligence official stationed at the base - was interviewed by police but then returned to the United States after claiming diplomatic immunity. That status has since beencast into doubtby the Foreign Office and Mr Dunn's family want Mrs Sacoolas to return to the UK. Speaking on CBS This Morning, Mr Dunn said the president had suggested the meeting with Mrs Sacoolas ""two or three times"". ""We said no, we didn't feel it was right. He said 'she's here, let's get it on, get some healing,' something like that,"" Mr Dunn told the US TV network. ""There was a bit of pressure but we stuck to our guns."" In a separate interview, Mr Dunn said: ""We didn't want to be railroaded into, not a circus as such, but into a meeting we weren't prepared for."" Ms Charles said they were ""a bit shocked"", adding: ""The bombshell was dropped soon after we walked in the room that Anne Sacoolas was in the building, and was willing to meet with us. ""I don't think it would be appropriate to meet her without therapists or mediators in the room."" Harry died in hospital after his motorbike was involved in a crash with a Volvo Family spokesman Radd Seiger described the White House meeting as ""absolutely extraordinary"" and ""unprecedented"". But he said US National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien told the family during the meeting that Mrs Sacoolas ""was never coming back"" to the UK. Harry Dunn's family threaten judicial review What is diplomatic immunity? US crash suspect's return 'non-negotiable' Ms Charles said she had told Mr Trump during the White House meeting: ""If it was your son you would be doing the same as us."" She added: ""He actually gripped my hand a little bit tighter and said 'yes I would be'. And that's when he said he would try and look at this from a different angle. ""I can only hope that he was sincere enough to consider doing that for us. ""He's the one in control here, but we're the ones in control of our situation as much as we can be - we still want justice for Harry and we will take it as far as we possibly can to ensure that that's done. ""We do feel that we have done as much as we can at the moment."" Anne Sacoolas, pictured on her wedding day in 2003 Ms Charles later told ITV's Good Morning Britain the family would ""be forever disappointed, forever disgusted in both the UK and US governments"" if Mrs Sacoolas did not return. Mr Dunn said the trip to the White House ""didn't feel like a stunt"". ""I think the president was very graceful and spoke very well to us,"" he said. ""I genuinely do think he will look to resolve this in a way that will help us."" Over the weekend, Mrs Sacoolas broke her silence over Mr Dunn's death in a letter via her lawyers. In it she said she wanted to meet his parents ""so that she can express her deepest sympathies and apologies for this tragic accident"". Mrs Sacoolas was said to be covered by diplomatic immunity as the spouse of a US intelligence official, though that protection is now in dispute. Northamptonshire Police said it would be submitting an evidence file to the UK Crown Prosecution Service ""very soon"".

"The BBC has revealed its list of 100 inspiring and influential women from around the world for 2019. This year 100 Women is asking: what would the future look like if it were driven by women? From climate change activist Greta Thunberg, to trans woman Nisha Ayub who was put into a male prison aged 21, many on the list are driving change on behalf of women everywhere. They give us their vision of what life could look like in 2030. Others, such as the ""ghost"" politician defying the mafia, and the footballer battling misogyny, are using their extraordinary personal experiences to blaze a path for those who follow. Precious Adams spent so much time dancing round the living room as a child, that her mum signed her up for dance lessons. She trained at several top ballet schools, including the National Ballet School of Canada, the Princess Grace Academy in Monaco and the Bolshoi Ballet Academy in Moscow. She was promoted to first artist by the English National Ballet in 2017, and won the Emerging Artist Award at the Critics' Circle National Dance Awards the following year. She has been credited with opening up a conversation on ballet dancers being able to wear tights that match their skin tone. My hope for the future is that more and more people engage with the arts. I'd like as many people as possible to find the same joy, freedom, and fulfilment from the arts that I have. Parveena is known as the ""Iron lady of Kashmir"". Her teenage son disappeared in 1990, at the height of an uprising against Indian rule in Kashmir. He is one of thousands of ""disappeared"" there - leading Parveena to set up the Association of Parents of Disappeared Persons (APDP). She says she has not given up hope of seeing her son again, with next year marking the 30th anniversary of his disappearance. The grief of losing my son to enforced disappearance inspires me to struggle for justice and accountability, and I aspire to work towards making the world a better place, especially for women. Known as Italy's ""ghost"" politician, Piera Aiello ran for office with her face covered by a veil due to threats from the mafia. In 2018, after winning her seat as an anti-mafia candidate, she finally revealed her face to the public. She has used her experience of being forced to marry the son of a mafia boss at 14 to advocate for the rights of police informants and their children. The truth lives on. Jasmin is Rohingya, described by the UN as one of the most persecuted minorities in the world. She was born in a refugee camp in Bangladesh just after her father died. Since arriving in the UK as a refugee, she has excelled at cricket, and together with her friends started an all-Asian girls' cricket team in Bradford. This year she was selected to represent England in the first Street Child Cricket World Cup for charity. All I know is the feeling, the sheer pleasure of the motion feels greater when every breath blows with liberation. Contemporary artist Manal AlDowayan's work explores invisibility, archives, memory and the representation of women in her country. From black and white photographs of Saudi Arabia's female workforce, to a frozen flock of birds imprinted with the permission slip Saudi women require to travel. In 2018, the British Museum placed two of her artworks on long-term display in the Islamic Gallery. Every day I am confronted with the incredible brilliance and courage of women around me, and I can only see a better future when these women have their place in society and history. In 2016, Kimia became the first Iranian woman to win a medal at the Olympics since the country began competing in 1948. As a taekwondo athlete, Kimia is credited with ""emboldening Iranian girls and women to push the boundaries of personal freedom"" by the UK's Financial Times newspaper. The 21-year-old is now training three times a day to seek qualification for Tokyo 2020, where she hopes to inspire the next generation of Iranian women in martial arts. In Iran, female athletes face different challenges. But I hope in the face of all the hardships we will continue and never give up. Dr Alanoud Alsharekh is a founding member of the Abolish 153 campaign, calling for Kuwait's ""honour-killing"" law to be scrapped. She works with institutions to improve gender equality in the Middle East, and was the first Kuwaiti awarded France's National Order of Merit, for her defence of women's rights. Training and empowering future female leaders is a major issue that I am doing my part to see resolved in the immediate future, not only in Kuwait but across the region. When war broke out in architect Marwa Al-Sabouni's home city of Homs, Syria, she refused to leave. She has written a book documenting this time, and has drawn up plans to rebuild the destroyed Baba Amr district, in a way that would bring different classes and ethnic groups together. She runs the world's only website dedicated to architectural news in Arabic, and has received the Prince Claus award, which honours âoutstanding achievement of visionaries at the front-line of culture and developmentâ. Without home there is no future. My hope is that we can raise enough awareness to build places for people to which they can truly belong. It isn't an exaggeration to claim that much of the troubles of our time would be diminished through this act. Rida Al Tubuly is one of many women pushing for gender equality - but she's doing it from a warzone. Her organisation, Together We Build It, pushes for women's involvement in solving Libya's conflict. In 2018, she told the Human Rights Council in Geneva that high level UN meetings about Libya's future were failing to include women. The university professor holds a postgraduate degree in International Human Rights Law. Women's future is now, not tomorrow and not the day after. I promote peace at all levels, and I'm confident that women are able to very soon change the status quo in fields historically designated to men, such as peace building and conflict mediation. Tabata Amaral, one of Brazil's youngest congresswomen, came to national attention this year when a video of her grilling the country's education minister went viral. Dubbed ""Brazil's Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez"" by the press, the 25-year-old grew up on the outskirts of Sao Paulo where she lost her father to drug addiction. Dedicating herself to her education, she won a place at Harvard University with a full scholarship, and graduated in Political Science and Astrophysics. As a member of parliament, her main agendas are education, women's rights, political innovation and sustainable futures. My biggest hope for the future of women in Brazil is that our fight for equal rights, for equal opportunities, be so consolidated that the next generation of girls will be born knowing no limits to their dreams. Yalitza Aparicio trained as a primary school teacher, but ended up being cast as the lead in Alfonso CuarÃ³n's Oscar-winning film Roma after accompanying her sister to the audition. She became the first indigenous Mexican woman to be nominated for a Best Actress Oscar for the role. She now advocates for gender equality, rights for indigenous communities and constitutional protection for domestic workers. The ideal future for women is one in which we achieve gender equality; we have the same rights and the same opportunities men have. In the workplace, a future in which our pay is fair and we are compensated for the value we generate - that would be a good start. Born in Lebanon but raised in the US, poet Dayna Ash was shocked when she was advised to hide her sexuality on her return to Beirut at 16. So she founded Haven for Artists, an all-inclusive organisation for artists and activists, and the city's only cultural and creative safe space for women and the LGBTQI+ community. She and her team run the centre for free, allowing vulnerable people to live in the residence and encouraging them to exchange tools, skills, and experience. Freedom is not only ours to demand but to design. Dina is the fastest woman in British history and the first British woman to win a major global sprint title. She took gold in the final of the women's 200m at the World Athletics Championships in Doha, after she had already taken silver in the 100m. Sport allows you to view your body in a positive way as you see the amazing things it is able to do and how it can change. This helps to build self-esteem and leads to healthier lifestyles both in a physical and mental capacity. I want sport to be an area where young women can be unapologetically themselves. NASA's MiMi Aung is responsible for a team designing a helicopter to fly on Mars. After travelling alone from Myanmar to the US to further her education at 16, MiMi is now project manager at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), California Institute of Technology. She is challenged with building an aircraft light enough to fly in the very thin atmosphere of the Red Planet - it should reach the surface in February 2021. My view for the future is continued advancement and innovation of new capabilities. Personally for me, it has been about first-of-its-kind, increasingly capable autonomous systems for space exploration. I believe that critical thinking is key to making major advancements. At 21, trans woman Nisha Ayub was sentenced to three months in a male prison under a provision of Sharia law which prohibits ""a male person wearing women's attire or posing as a woman in a public space.â Since her release, she has been a tireless advocate for the rights of transgender people in Malaysia, co-founding SEED - the country's first ever trans-led organisation - and creating T-Home, which addresses the issue of homelessness for older trans women who are left without family support. She was awarded the US International Women of Courage award in 2016 for her work. Trans people are just as human as everyone. We cry in tears, we bleed red, we have dreams and hopes, we want to be loved and cared for, we have feelings and emotions as we are your own reflection... we are not asking for special rights but the same equal rights as others. Raised on a farm in Uganda, Judith Bakirya became the first of her peers to win a scholarship to a prestigious girls' boarding school, going on to obtain a masters in the UK and a job in the City. But unsatisfied in her work, she quit, using her savings to fly home and found an organic fruit farm, Busaino Fruits & Herbs. Since winning a national agriculture award, she has used the platform to draw attention to women's rights issues, including lack of land ownership, lack of access to education and domestic violence. Working with women smallholder garden owners in innovative ways, honouring indigenous knowledge and developing biodiverse agroecosystems, promotes sustainable food production and nutrition. Branded as 21st Century building blocks, Ayah Bdeir's littleBits company makes kits of electronic blocks that snap together with magnets, allowing anyone to ""build, prototype, and invent"". Already used in thousands of schools across the US, this year Ayah launched a $4m value initiative with Disney to try and close the gender gap in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, (STEM), supplying 15,000 10-year-old girls in California with free littleBits kits. I am on a mission to make sure every kid â regardless of gender, background, or ethnicity â has the skills to invent the world they want to live in. Buddhism is Thailand's most common religion, with some 300,000 Buddhist monks. But female monks - known as bhikkhunis - aren't recognised, and are banned from being ordained on Thai soil. So in 2003, Dhammananda Bhikkhuni flew to Sri Lanka to be ordained, and returned as Thailand's first female monk. There are now 100 others like her. She is abbess of Songdhammakalyani - the country's first ever all-female Buddhist monastery. We still need to struggle to make the ordination of women in Thailand a reality. Feminist medical doctor Mabel Bianco has spent four decades putting women's health, reproductive rights, abortion, and HIV/AIDS on the public policy agenda in Argentina. She has introduced policies to save women's lives - from tackling breast cancer to violence against women - and has been a pioneer of sex education in the face of Roman Catholic conservatism. This year marks her 30th as president of the Foundation for Studies and Research on Women (FEIM) supporting the rights of women in Latin America and the world. I want a near future without women dying needlessly. I hope we will reach a point where women all over the world can decide freely about their lives, their bodies, and whether to be mothers or not without risking death, and are able to live without gender violence. Raya is founder and CEO of the award-winning Awecademy, an organisation with a mission to use education to improve the world. It aims to inspire teachers and students with online learning modules like 21st Century Skills and Cosmic Citizenship, to bring positive change to humanity for the future. I am intelligently optimistic about the future. This is because the future of humanity is not pre-defined or set in stone, but rather it's up to us to create it. We can choose to create a future that is brimming with prosperity, progress, and love. Katie was a key leader on the team that developed algorithms and techniques to recover the first-ever image of a black hole. She started the project as a graduate student, and is now an assistant professor of computing and mathematical sciences at the California Institute of Technology. Katie collaborated with a number of women on the Event Horizon Telescope team to pull off this feat, on everything from instrumentation to black hole theory. My ambition for the future is that we use artificial intelligence and machine-learning methods to design better scientists, who tell us how to go and discover the world around us. After recounting not being able to reach the locks on toilet doors in a candid speech in 2017, SinÃ©ad Burke quickly became one of the world's most influential disability activists. Calling for all design to be more accessible, she has challenged some of the biggest names in the fashion industry - including Anna Wintour - to make clothing more inclusive. This year she became the first little person to appear on the cover of Vogue, and is launching her first podcast, aimed at challenging us to confront our biases and feel empowered to impact the world. As women move into positions that can create systemic change, we must be explicit in our refusal to repeat the cycles of oppression and exclusion that have been indelibly etched into our consciousness and beings. Our approach to redesigning the future must be intersectional. Author of Contraceptive Justice: Why We Need a Male Pill, bioethicist Lisa Campo-Engelstein's work aims to improve women's lives through finding new methods of contraception. She also specialises in improving fertility for cancer survivors. A word after a word after a word is power. (Margaret Atwood) Scarlett is co-founder of The Pink Protest, an online community of activists who supported the successful #FreePeriods campaign to get free menstrual products in schools in England. They have also helped push a bill through Parliament to make FGM part of the Children's Act. Scarlett's book, It's Not OK to Feel Blue (and other lies), brings together high-profile figures to talk about their experiences of mental health and the stigma surrounding the issue. Because the future will not be drawn without them. Delivering post in rural Wales, Ella was shocked by the amount of discarded plastic on the streets. So she started a campaign for plastic-free period products, successfully lobbying manufacturers to make real changes and councils to spend their period poverty funding on eco-friendly products. My hopes for the future are that period products come without plastic, governments make sustainable choices and manufacturers put the planet before profit. British-Indian Sharan is founder and editor-in-chief of Burnt Roti magazine, focusing on mental and sexual health for young South Asians, and LGBTQ rights. Aided by crowdfunding, she published her first print issue in April 2016 and has since launched an online version. The platform hosted the Let's Talk About Sex workshop in London in 2018, to try to end stigma around being South Asian and sexually active. Our conversation around gender has become more visible and we're fighting for recognition of people who identify differently to how they were assigned at birth...It's hard to identify progress with hostile political climates governing our language and accessibility. Salwa Eid Naser stunned the field in the 400m final in Doha this year by running faster than any woman has done for more than three decades. The reigning 400m world champion was born in Anambra State, Nigeria, but moved to Bahrain at 14 seeking opportunities to further her running career. She now represents the Gulf State internationally. I don't fear nothing for the future because it is something I can handle when it comes. I really want to get it all - now I have the world gold medal, I want to keep going and get the Olympic gold medal. Rana el Kaliouby is a pioneer of artificial emotional intelligence, or Emotion AI. Her start-up Affectiva has developed software that can understand emotions by analysing facial expressions through a camera. The technology is being installed in vehicles to detect sleepy drivers. Also a passionate advocate for gender equity in tech and AI, Rana is a World Economic Forum Young Global Leader. She holds a PhD from the University of Cambridge and a post-doctorate from MIT. AI is at an inflection point: it's increasingly acting on our behalf, taking on roles traditionally held by people. As we plan for a future, we need to ensure that diversity of all kinds - gender, race, age, education and perspectives - are represented. When Maria Fernanda Espinosa became president of the UN General Assembly, she became only the fourth woman to hold the position in the body's history - and the first from Latin America and the Caribbean. She has called on governments to put forward billions of dollars to tackle climate change, and announced her determination to fight gender discrimination. I envisage a future where efforts by the multilateral systems have led to the equal participation of men and women in politics, and to the protection of the rights of women who fight daily for jobs with equal conditions, and of women and girls who are the victims of violence. As South Africa faces rising rates of murder and rape against women and girls, Lucinda has emerged as a voice for women. She leads nationwide marches, rallying thousands of women in the streets of Cape Town, challenging government to translate policy into action. Lucinda founded Philisa Abafazi Bethu (Heal our Women), a non-profit organisation offering services including counselling, search committees for kidnapped girls and safe houses for women escaping domestic abuse. My hopes, as a Khoisan woman, are that we will one day be freed from violence against our bodies, and the bodies of our daughters, sisters, mothers and aunties. I hope that one day we will have a female president. For this, I will continue to advocate and rise in pain to power. Sister Gerard is a Roman Catholic nun in Singapore, who worked for three decades as a death row counsellor. Now 81, she has ""walked with"" 18 inmates before their deaths, describing her calling as helping ""people who are broken"". A female future, like any other, would be one filled with kindness, dignity and equality; a world without discrimination or hate, one that's driven by compassion. Overcoming a fear of water after falling into an adult pool as a toddler, Bethany Firth burst onto the swimming scene at the London 2012 Paralympics. Bethany, who has learning disabilities, is now a four-time Paralympic gold medallist and multiple world record holder, and was Britain's most decorated athlete at the Rio 2016 Paralympics. This year she won two golds at the World Para-swimming Championships in London, and was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) for services to swimming in 2017. In swimming I think we've already got good equality in the sport but I'm really pleased to see new innovations such as mixed relay events being included at major events like the World Championships and Paralympic Games and only increasing opportunities to compete on the same stage. Owl - aka Ugla StefanÃ­a KristjÃ¶nudÃ³ttir JÃ³nsdÃ³ttir - is a journalist, writer and trans campaigner. They are the co-director of My Genderation, a film project focusing on trans lives and trans experiences. They also work with All About Trans, a project creating positive representation of transgender people in the media. They co-wrote the Trans Teen Survival Guide, to help empower transgender and non-binary teens. The future must move beyond the oppressive binaries of sex and gender - otherwise we will never truly break free and deconstruct the systems that have kept us complacent for so long. After storming to victory in 10.71 seconds at the women's 100m final in Doha in September 2019, Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce now boasts more 100m world championship titles than Usain Bolt. It makes the Jamaican track and field sprinter the oldest woman to ever win an Olympic or world 100m title - and the first mum to do so since 1995. She carried son Zyon, two, on her lap of honour, saying she wanted to ""inspire women thinking of starting a family"". Finding balance is never easy but we as women get to decide. I never limit myself as to what is possible as long as my body will cooperate. It's important for the future of athletics that women continue to challenge themselves. I am excited to see just how far I can go, even at this stage of my career. At 26, Zarifa Ghafari is one of Afghanistan's first female mayors. The country's president appointed her mayor of Maidan Wardag, where support for the Taliban is widespread. She took the job despite it being too dangerous for her to live there - her office was mobbed by angry men on her first day. In the face of this adversity, she has taken to the streets with free rubbish bags as part of her clean city initiative, and says her goal is to make people believe in women's power. I'm the first female mayor for this war-torn province but I don't want to be the only one forever. I wish there were more women working alongside me in local government and leading departments and I am trying to make this a reality for other Afghan women. Human rights lawyer Jalila specialises in defending women's rights in Pakistan, and provides free legal services to women in poverty. She is founder of We the Humans, a non-profit organisation working with local communities to provide opportunities for vulnerable women and children. She is the first female lawyer from the persecuted Hazara community, and in 2018 she went on hunger strike demanding protection for her people. Looking back into the past leads to the realisation that the entire politics of conflict, war and destruction is interconnected with Patriarchy. This is the time now that the world should accept the future as female; [women] are the symbol of peace, fertility, creation and coexistence. Let the women lead. Tayla Harris is an Australian rules footballer playing for Carlton Football Club in the AFL Women's league, and a professional boxer. Since a photo of her kicking a ball during a match attracted misogynistic comments in March, a bronze statue of her has been unveiled in Melbourne's Federation Square, immortalising the kick in Australian sporting history. She also holds an unbeaten professional boxing record. A tattoo on my right arm reads 'fortune favours the brave'. I got this when I had my first professional boxing fight and moved away from family and friends to live in Melbourne and since this milestone, I've been fortunate to experience things I never would have thought possible. Hollie is a survivor of sex trafficking from Columbus, Ohio, US. She was first sold by her mother at the age of 15 and was enslaved through drug-use for 17 years. With the help of an innovative court programme called CATCH Court - which spots criminals who are actually victims - she was able to escape in 2015. Most women who are sex trafficked in the US are branded with tattoos or scars and she has since transformed the tattoos on her own body. She is working as a legal advocate for victims of domestic violence at a local Columbus court and is at the helm of Reaching For the Shining Starz â a non-profit organisation that helps victims of sex trafficking. Sex trafficking survivors are the most powerful, motivated, and compassionate group of people I've met in my lifetime. The ability to learn to trust, love, and forgive after we've been betrayed and badly abused â often by the people we loved â astonishes me. We genuinely are a resilient group that come back stronger than before. Huang Wensi, 29, is one of a small but growing number of female boxers in China. Challenging traditional stereotypes of women's roles, she overcame postpartum depression to win the Asia Female Continental Super Flyweight Championship gold belt in 2018. She wants to continue to fight social stigma against women in sport. I want to prove that women have the power to move the world. I hope more women are not just defined by their family, but their dream, too. This year, artist Luchita Hurtado landed her first solo show in a public gallery - at the age of 98. Born in Venezuela, and wife of influential artist Lee Mullican, she spent years treating her art as a private diary, before some 1,200 of her works were unearthed while curators were clearing out her late husband's studio. Hurtado's environmental advocacy continues to inform the visual language of her work. We should think before we vote Tired of the pain she suffered wearing heels eight hours a day at work, Yumi decided to vent her frustration on Twitter. Within days, Japan's #kutoo movement was born, with thousands of women sharing stories about being forced to wear heels to work as part of their uniform. Yumi gathered a petition of 20,000 signatures which she presented to the government over the issue. We're still in the situation where lots of people don't even realise there's gender discrimination in Japan, and for the #KuToo campaign too, lots of people don't regard it as an issue of discrimination. I hope people notice this kind of discrimination in our daily lives, and realise men and women are equal. Through a career in journalism and community social work, Asmaa has become the voice of Sierra Leone's voiceless. After learning of the rape of a five-year-old girl, she used her media platform to launch the Black Tuesday campaign, which encouraged women to wear black on the last Tuesday of each month to protest over the increase in the rape and abuse of girls under 12. The movement prompted presidential action to reform sexual violence policies. To all the women out there - we will find ourselves in male-dominated professions. Take the opportunity to stay on and persist. This is how the future holds more of us as leaders. Aranya uses beat poetry to address issues like gender equality, mental health and body positivity. Her performance of A Brown Girl's Guide to Beauty has been viewed over three million times on YouTube. If women joined the workforce the global GDP could increase by $28 trillion. Why are we limiting half of the world's population and their potential? What could a gender equal world look like? And how far are we from it? Katrina Johnston-Zimmerman is an urban anthropologist, working to make cities better places to live in. She co-founded The Women Led Cities Initiative, which aims to bring women's voices to the forefront of urban planning and design. The future of our cities is female because it has to be. Without a greater level of diversity, through women's input and impact on our urban environments, we are at an impasse for the future of these, our manufactured habitats. Dr Gada Kadoda helps women in remote areas use solar power to bring electricity to their villages by training them as community engineers. She was named a Unicef innovator to watch as the driving force behind Sudan's first innovation lab, giving students a space for collaborative working and problem-solving. She is founder of the Sudanese Knowledge Society, which gives young researchers the opportunity to freely interact with scientists and scholars from inside and outside the country. Women's urgent futures depend on mastering liberation tools to enrich our options. Born with a rare condition which left her with missing skin, Amy Karle grew up fascinated by the possibility of what the human body could be capable of with the right technology. Now an award-winning bioartist, her work includes a human hand design made with 3D-printed scaffolds and stem cells. Biotechnology can lead us into a very promising future or irreversible demise. It is of vital importance that we thoroughly and thoughtfully contemplate the range of dangers and potentials and work together to establish strategies to utilise our technology for the best and highest good of humanity. Self-proclaimed 'mother of all Sudanese martyrs', Ahlam's 17-year-old son was killed in a peaceful protest in 2013. Since then, Ahlam has dedicated her life to seeking justice for him, and fighting for the rights of those killed or 'disappeared' in Sudan. She was part of underground forums and protests and was ""brutally beaten"" when caught by security forces. In the movement that started in December 2018 against then-President Omar al-Bashir, Ahlam became a prominent protester, leading rallies with strong ties to the youth on the ground. Sudan will become again an important and powerful country. The young Sudanese have learned about their rights. Once they have become aware of what rights they are entitled to, they will never accept to abandon them. In 2019, cancer researcher Fiona Kolbinger became the first woman ever to win the Transcontinental Race - one of the world's toughest cycling races. Covering 4,000 km in 10 days - from Bulgaria to France - she beat off 264 competitors, the majority of which were male. I hope that one day, nobody will be underestimated because of gender, age, ethnicity or educational background any more â creating a respectful society that promotes confidence and gives equal chances to everybody. Hiyori Kon, 21, is a sumo wrestling prodigy in a country where women are still barred from competing professionally. She was the subject of the 2018 award-winning documentary Little Miss Sumo, which charted her battle to change the rules of one of the world's oldest sports, and give a voice to women in sumo. I would like to give the opportunity for children all over the world to get involved with sumo, and make sumo an Olympic sport. AÃ¯ssata Lam set up the Youth Chamber of Commerce of Mauritania to support young women entrepreneurs struggling to access funding for their start-ups. She is a vocal advocate for women's rights, using her platform to honour exceptional Mauritanian women, and was appointed to the G7 Gender Equality Advisory Council by French President Emmanuel Macron. The time is coming when women's voices cannot be silenced, nor ignored. The time is coming when women's equal participation in today's most pressing issues is necessary. The time is coming when women's seat at the table is non-negotiable. This time is now. Forensic psychology professor Soo Jung Lee has worked on numerous high-profile murder cases in South Korea. Based at Kyonggi University in Seoul, she has challenged the legal system, helping introduce an anti-stalking bill. She believes stalking leads to more serious crimes in many cases, where the majority of the victims are vulnerable women. As a forensic psychologist, I want the future to be a safe place for my children. Fei-Fei Li arrived in the US from China at 16 with no English language skills, working part-time in her parents' dry-cleaning business. Now widely credited as a pioneer of artificial intelligence, the former Google vice president co-directs Stanford's institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI), which is looking at how to develop ethical AI. Li is co-founder of AI4ALL, which is focused on recruiting more women and minorities to build AI. We are on the cusp of the Age of Artificial Intelligence (AI). This new era has the potential to help us realise our shared dream of a better future for all of humanity, but it will bring with it challenges and opportunities we can't yet foresee. My hope is that we will bring more voices, more views, and more expertise to the discussion. An award-winning independent adult filmmaker exploring how women can help shape the future of porn. She has also written a guide for parents on how to talk to their children about porn. Pornography isn't going anywhere; if we take action now, we can decide what happens next. Nominated for BBC 100 Women list by Jameela Jamil and the I Weigh community, Lauren Mahon is one third of the powerhouse trio ""kicking cancer's arse"" on BBC 5 Live's podcast You, Me & The Big C. The campaigner has set up online community Girl vs Cancer to provide young women with information on cancer charities, news on the nuances of treatments and tips for what to buy a bestie with cancer. My hope for the future is that every single female-identifying or non-binary human on the planet stands in their power and purpose. This is how we're going to change the world. Julie is from Tanzania, one of five countries in the world with the highest estimated number Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) births annually. She has dedicated the past two decades to research on treatment for the disease and working to influence health policies so that individuals across Africa can access vital diagnostic tests and medicines. She is trying to establish life-changing interventions including blood transfusion and hydroxyurea, a medicine with strong effects on the bone marrowâ a step towards the treatment of Sickle Cell Disease. Now she is researching a cure using gene therapy. Sickle cell disease research in Tanzania will have a significant impact in raising awareness about a disease that affects many people in Africa and the achievements made to improve healthcare. Lisa Mandemaker is leading the team building a prototype artificial womb, in collaboration with the MÃ¡xima Medical Centre in Holland. It is hoped the wombs will replace incubators for babies within the next 10 years. Social designer Lisa sees design as a tool for debate, to challenge assumptions, question or excite. The beginning of life slowly becomes a domain that we can design, and everyone should be part of the discussion on how we design this. At 16, Jamie co-founded the Zero Hour movement, using social media to organise the first youth climate change marches in 25 cities, including Washington DC. She has since testified before the US Congress alongside Greta Thunberg. The future must be decolonised and re-connected to the ancient wisdom of the Earth we once cherished. Climate change is a man-made problem, which is why women should rule the world. A formidable leader of the Afro-Colombian community, Francia MÃ¡rquez spearheaded a 10-day, 350-mile women's march to the country's capital, to take back their ancestral land from illegal gold miners. After 22 days of protests on the streets, the Colombian government agreed to stem illegal mining in the mountainous region of La Toma. The human rights and environmental activist has faced death threats over her actions, which won her the prestigious Goldman Environmental Prize. My hope is that human consciousness is being raised to understand that we are not masters of nature, we are part of it, and so we must take care of it, in the same way that it takes care of us. After being upskirted at a music festival, Gina Martin launched a campaign to make upskirting illegal in England and Wales. The law was changed this year after an 18-month legal fight. Four men have been convicted under the new legislation so far. Prosecutors say all of the victims were ""simply going about their business on public transport, shopping or attending events when they were targeted"". I spend my time wondering what society would look like if we cared about the things that don't directly affect us. My hope is that, in my lifetime, I get to see that. Sarah is one of Scotland's leading gynaecologists. As a senior lecturer in reproductive medicine at the University of Dundee, she has focused on solving male infertility, to try to stop women being subjected to unnecessary and invasive fertility treatments. I hope that we can harness science, technology, investment and innovation in male reproductive health to redress global inequalities and the current burden of fertility on women. Singer Raja Meziane's political music video Allo le SystÃ¨me! has been viewed more than 35 million times on YouTube. Her anti-government songs tackling social injustice, alleged corruption and inequality have seen her forced into exile from Algeria. Now based in Prague, she is a vocal supporter of Algeria's protests in 2019, which have seen tens of thousands of young people taking to the streets calling for change. To those who oppose us, we say, 'Strike the woman, and you strike the rock'. (Winnie Mandela) Hailed as 'India's space woman', spaceship designer Susmita founded India's first space start-up. A passionate climate action advocate, she uses her business to help monitor and understand climate change from space. I fear that in three to four generations our home planet will not be very habitable anymore. I hope that humanity will wake up to a Greta-esque urgency for climate action. When Benedicte looked around the Democratic Republic of Congo, she could see plenty of raw produce from potato to passionfruit, but still people were living in food poverty. She says supermarkets were full of products originally grown in DR Congo, but exported out, processed with preservatives, before being reimported at expensive prices. She founded Surprise Tropical, a food canteen serving healthy, takeaway food in the suburbs of the capital, Kinshasa. Five years on, the company's online business delivers fresh produce throughout the city. The future belongs to those who see the opportunities behind what others see as problems or frustrations. Based at the International Center for Research on Women, Subhalakshmi has spent over 15 years working to improve gender equality in Asia. Her focus is the rights of women farmers, ending violence against women and improving women's education. My hope for the future is that women will no longer be invisible and uncounted. Women themselves will be organised and will better articulate the work that they do to uphold the entire economy and society. Government data and policy will also respond to the reality of women's work, both paid and unpaid. Trang Nguyen grew up in Vietnam, confronted from a young age with monkeys chained up for sale on the streets and bears held to extract bile for traditional medicine. So she obtained a PhD in Biodiversity Management, and set up WildAct, a non-profit organisation which helps authorities monitor illegal wildlife trade markets. In 2018, it launched the country's first ever master's course in Combating Illegal Wildlife Trade, to help train the next generation of conservationists. People need to put aside their prejudices and work together to gain a better understanding of the issues of conservation and create solutions for the problems that will be effective and long lasting. For the future of nature conservation, it is important that women's voices are heard and their actions are recognised. Van is co-founder of the Will to Live Center, which provides training for disabled people in Vietnam's capital, Hanoi. Her aim is to create an equal working environment for all. She also runs social enterprise Imagator, which employs 80 people, half of whom have a disability. I wish the environment in Vietnam enabled people with talent and devotion to develop, instead of people feeling like they need to move abroad to use their skills. Natasha is a yogini, a female master practitioner of yoga and wellness coach. The body positivity influencer often opens up about her traumatic childhood on social media, after losing her mother at the age of three and being the victim of child abuse. My hopes for the future are that we live in an empowered world for every human being. Equal opportunities and equal basic liberties...everyone working to improve their emotional intelligence and their intelligence quotient. So empathic and consciously aware humans are created. This year, aged 29, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez became the youngest woman ever to serve in the United States Congress. She grew up in the Bronx and volunteered as a campaigner in the 2016 Presidential elections. Against all the odds, she defeated a veteran congressman in the June 2018 primaries, and has since been dubbed the future of the Democratic party. Her trademark look is no accident â she chose red lipstick and hoops for her swearing in ceremony so that ânext time someone tells Bronx girls to take off their hoops, they can just say they're dressing like a Congresswoman.â We are fighting for a future where no person is left behind. When people want to stop talking about the issues that black women face, trans women face, immigrant women face, we've got to ask them, âWhy does that make you so uncomfortable?' Because it's not just about identity, this is about justice. Everyone deserves justice. Nicknamed 'the golden fish', in 2017 Farida became the first woman in Egypt to win a medal when she claimed bronze in the 50m butterfly at the FINA World Aquatics Championships. She won another bronze this year. She gives lectures at universities to inspire the younger generation to pursue swimming, and is training to fulfill her ambition of winning a medal at the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo. My hope for the future is to have more female athletes excel at their sport in order to represent Egypt well internationally. I want them to believe in their dreams and do whatever it takes until it becomes a reality. Ashcharya Peiris was on her way home from work at a bank in Sri Lanka when a bomb blast left her blind in 2000. She lost her job to her disability, but ended up fulfilling her dream of becoming a fashion designer by describing her designs to a seamstress. She was a finalist in Sri Lanka's Up & Coming Fashion Designer competition, and is now a motivational speaker in garment factories, inspiring young women to follow their own dreams. Trials and tribulations in life are nothing but disguised blessings that empower you to achieve your goals. Fashion designer Danit once found herself at a conference with nothing to wear, so quickly designed a skirt on her laptop and 3D-printed it. She wants all women to have the same option. Her entirely 3D-printed collection has been showcased by Vogue and US supermodel Tyra Banks. In the future, I hope technology improves, and women will be able to choose sustainable but still fashionable garments when they get dressed in the morning. Autumn Peltier has been campaigning for clean drinking water for indigenous people in Canada since she was just eight years old. This year, at 14, she was named Chief Water Commissioner for the Anishinabek Nation, taking on the role from her great-aunt Josephine Mandamin. One day I will be an ancestor, and I want my great-grandchildren to know I advocated for them so they can have clean drinking water and have a future. Swietenia founded the Divers Clean Action Foundation to clear marine debris in Indonesia. They now have 1,500 volunteers working across the island nation and South East Asia. She also initiated the #nostrawmovement campaign in the country, which saw the reduction of single-use plastic straws in more than 700 restaurants. Youth are the agents of change, and create change faster, whilst women are the agents in each household, who will make eco-friendly decisions for future generations. Megan Rapinoe is a two-time World Cup winner and co-captain of the US Women's National Team. She led the team to victory in the 2019 Women's World Cup, scoring some of the biggest goals of the tournament. She was named Best FIFA Women's Player 2019. Megan is a vocal advocate for equality in soccer, taking legal action against the US Soccer Federation over equal pay, calling out racism by fans and has become the face of LGBTQ rights in the game. If everybody was as outraged about racism as those who suffer it, if everybody was as outraged about homophobia as LGBTQ players, if everybody was as outraged about the lack of equal pay as women, that would be the most inspiring thing for the future to me. Onjali Rauf was recovering from life-saving surgery when the idea for her first book came to her. Inspired by a real-life meeting between herself and a refugee mother in Calais, The Boy at the Back of the Class is a child's perspective on the refugee crisis and won the Waterstones Children's Book Prize 2019. She is also founder of Making Herstory, which seeks to end the abuse, enslavement and trafficking of women and girls in the UK and beyond. The future for us women seems both a beautiful and a precarious thing. Beautiful because in so many ways, untold stories of just how much women have been sacrificed at the altar of male progression are finally seeing the light of day. But the advancements are fragile too â with outright misogynists and abusers still in seats of power and women still battling wars that our great-grandmothers were battling too. As a graduate student, Charlene Ren created MyH2O, a solution to the lack of clean drinking water in rural China. Now her non-profit platform has created a nationwide water information mapping network, training locals and students to do their own testing so water organisations know where to take action and which communities are in need. The gender ratios are extremely biased in the NGO sector - significantly more women have chosen to serve in a sector that receives minimal funding, resources and acknowledgement yet [they] strive to create a better and inclusive future. Maria Ressa is an award-winning journalist from the Philippines who set up website Rappler to expose fake news. She has received rape and death threats online for being an outspoken critic of President Duterte's violent war on drugs, and has been arrested twice this year accused of 'cyber libel'. Ms Ressa is being represented by human rights lawyer Amal Clooney. For the next generation, the battle is going to be the battle for truth. What's happening to us in the Philippines isn't unique â we are just the canary in the coal mine. You have to shine the light, you have to speak, you have to say what is happening. Writer Djamila Ribeiro is one of the most influential figures in the Afro-Brazilian women's rights movement. Her work focuses on themes including black feminism, racism, and female empowerment. She is founder of the Sueli Carneiro's Seal initiative, which publishes black writers' works at affordable prices. To think about the future, first it's necessary to recognise past mistakes. Only by facing colonialism and its consequences, will it be possible to co-exist with dignity Jawahir Roble is the UK's first Muslim, black, female, hijab-wearing referee. Having come to the UK from Somalia at the age of ten, she discovered a passion for sports which led her to become a referee. She now studies football coaching and management, hoping to complete her degree in 2020. I have two dreams: one day to referee in the Women's World Cup Final and to get as many girls as possible playing football. I urge more women to participate and take up refereeing Professor Saliba is conducting world-leading research on polluted air. She grew up on her family's farm in rural Lebanon, but when civil war prompted a move to the city, she was awakened to the disturbing realities of air pollution. After watching relatives, friends and colleagues develop health complications as a result of exposure to toxic substances in the environment, she hopes her innovative work with a Beirut university will make it possible to address some of the most pressing environmental challenges. Like the positive and negative dipoles defining a chemical bond, and the yin and the yang staging the balance in nature, women and men must co-reign to solve our current and future environmental threats. Nanjira leads the World Wide Web Foundation in its bid to increase digital equality. She looks for solutions to ensure nobody is left behind when it comes to web access, whether disadvantaged by gender or geography. My hope is that we see it happen more and more, and not only when women are 'given' positions to fulfil diversity quotas or clean up messes. We have a ways to go for 'The Female Future' to unleash its true potential to heal the world. Biophysicist Zehra Sayers has been hailed as a beacon of hope for the Middle East (Nature journal) for her success in her contribution to bringing scientists from eight Middle Eastern countries together. During her 15-year tenure as chair of the Science Advisory Committee of SESAME project, she worked with a group of scientists including those from Israel, Palestine, Turkey and Cyprus, under the same roof to found a CERN-like laboratory. She shared the prestigious 2019 Award for Science Diplomacy for the feat. I am very happy to see young female scientists at SESAME today, either as staff members or as users. I believe that SESAME provides several opportunities for women from the Middle East to make their research more visible and their voice better heard. At 16, Hayfa founded not-for-profit Entrcrush, an online platform for future entrepreneurs where they could be matched with donors, and take e-courses in areas like management and accounting. She works with the UN in Tunisia on gender equality initiatives. One day, I want to wake up to find gender equality is real. I will stay out late that night; I will wear whatever I want to, without worrying about being harassed. I will be free to live by myself if I want to; I will earn as much as a man. Computer scientist Noor Shaker left Syria for Europe in 2008 to follow her passion for Artificial Intelligence. After a successful decade in academia, she turned her skills toward entrepreneurial innovation. Motivated by her mother's fight against cancer, Shaker was compelled to bring her knowledge of AI to the medical world. The result is a ground-breaking technique using AI to design new medicines faster than humans. Her work has attracted the attention of some of the top global pharmaceutical companies, and she has been named one of MIT's 'Innovators under 35'. Algorithms can now autonomously improve and provide augmented capabilities for innovation in ways never possible before. This will empower the next generations with tools for early detection and prevention of deadly diseases leading to longer and healthier lives. Inspired by her mum's determination to obtain a degree despite pressure to become a housewife, Bonita Sharma helps educate and empower women and girls in her native Nepal. In a bid to tackle child deaths to malnutrition, she designed Nutribeads, a bracelet for new mums with different coloured beads to remind them what to feed their babies. Her projects have been awarded funding from the UNESCO Malala Fund,  and she has founded her own organisation to empower women and girls: The Social Changemakers and Innovators. There are people in the world who are facing the devastating consequences of inequality in health, education and nutrition right now, and there are women and girls who are working relentlessly to change this status quo. I hope every woman and girl will have an opportunity to reach their full potential in life without any discrimination. In the 1970s, she was part of a movement of women who threw their arms around trees to prevent them being felled - the original 'tree-huggers'. Now a world-renowned environmental leader and winner of the Alternative Nobel Peace Prize, the 'ecofeminist' sees women as the custodians of nature. I hope that women will lead a transition away from catastrophe and collapse, and sow the seeds of our common future. When qualified doctor Pragati Singh started researching asexuality, she received messages from women who didn't want to have sex but were facing an arranged marriage. So she began organising meet-ups for people looking for non-sexual relationships. She now runs Indian Aces, an online community for asexual people. It's time we try increasingly inculcating *feminine* characteristics in our feminism - less 'strong', more 'empathetic'. Lawyer Lyubov Sobol investigates alleged corruption in Russia, documenting her work through social media and a YouTube channel with over a million subscribers. She and other opposition candidates were banned from standing in local elections in Moscow this summer, sparking demonstrations by tens of thousands of young people. To be honest, I don't really think about the future. We live in an unpredictable country. Anything can happen here. But in some long-term perspective I do believe that we will win. We will defend our country. Russia will be free and happy. Samah is a lawyer who has worked tirelessly in difficult circumstances since the war in Yemen started in 2015. She provides legal support to families whose children have 'disappeared'. This year her team at Mwatana for Human Rights managed to reunite some of these families, though she continues to advocate for the release and education of many more children still in detention. The time will come when people will be convinced in the pointlessness of wars. Then change will come, including legislative changes in terms of the rights of women specifically and Yemeni people in general. Self-taught screenwriter Kalista Sy's TV series Mistress of a Married Man sent shock waves through her home country when it was released earlier this year. Dubbed 'Senegal's Sex and the City', the viral sensation features sexually liberated, hard-working and successful female characters who address the struggles of women in West Africa, from polygamy to domestic abuse and mental health issues. Despite everything that women go through, despite all the mistakes they had to make, despite all the 'you can't do this', they know they can rise up, and be the best version of themselves - because the future will not be drawn without them. This summer, 22-year-old actress and director Bella Thorne released her own topless photos after a hacker threatened to leak them, saying, âIt's my decision now, you don't get to take another thing from me.â Bella, who has just directed her first porn film, says the abuse of women online can only change if more female content creators are involved in projects that celebrate sexuality. The female future for me is finally having equality. Women feel this pressure to say 'yes', like it's instinctual. I think that the female future is finally not having to do that anymore. Veronique Thouvenot leads the Zero Mothers Die initiative. It aims to save the lives of pregnant women and their babies through tech, providing women with mobile phones and health information by text. It is run by the Millennia2025 Foundation, of which Dr. Thouvenot is co-founder and scientific director. Help save women's lives with Zero Mothers Die! In August 2018, 15-year-old Greta Thunberg skipped school to protest outside the Swedish parliament. What started as a one-person strike has since spread to a worldwide protest over climate change. Her actions have mobilised activists across the world, with millions of young people taking part in Fridays for Future. This year, she travelled by solar-powered boat from Europe to the United States - an epic journey undertaken to encourage others to reduce their carbon footprint. She has also opened up about her diagnosis of Aspergers Syndrome, saying ""given the right circumstances, being different can be a superpower"". We are facing a disaster of unspoken sufferings for enormous amounts of people. And now is not the time for speaking politely or focusing on what we can or cannot say. Now is the time to speak clearly. Self-taught computer programmer Paola helped reverse 20,000 racially-biased drugs convictions by developing Data for Justice, a tool with an interactive map comparing police activity in white and minority neighborhoods. She won the MIT Innovators Under 35 Latam award for the project. There's still time to use data and technology to redistribute power among those that have been historically forgotten. If we don't do so now, data and tech will only automate the status quo and all the biases and inequalities that currently exist. At 95, poet Ida Vitale is winner of the Cervantes Prize, the most prestigious literary award in the Spanish-speaking world. Only the fifth woman to win the prize, she is the last surviving member of the important Uruguayan art movement known as the Generation of '45. She ends one of her most famous poems, Fortune, with the line ""To be human and a woman, no more, no less."" To have been able to speak and walk freely, and existed without mutilation, and entered churches, or not, and read, heard music that is dear to me, to have been at night a being, as in the light of day. (Fortune, 2005) Purity is a modern day 'senga'. The role traditionally sees aunt-figures training brides-to-be in how to sexually satisfy their husbands. But Purity wants to shake-up the role, helping Ugandan women feel empowered in their relationships. She is calling for all women to have legal rights in marriage. Freedom for women is the salvation of future generations. We cannot continue to live in the past. We need to be loud - there are few women who speak up because they fear the judgement of society. Let's teach these girls to love themselves and believe in themselves. Best-known for becoming New Zealand's youngest member of parliament in 1975 aged 23, Marilyn Waring is a pioneer of feminist economics, and author of the groundbreaking Counting for Nothing, which highlighted the value of womens' unpaid work. An environmental activist, she was also instrumental in the passing of New Zealand's nuclear-free policy. What we decide to measure now is what we will prioritise in the futureâ, âUnderneath the numbers, a philosophical judgement is always being made based on values, not facts."" (Still Counting, by Marilyn Waring) Amy Webb is a futurist who advises government leaders and the CEOs of some of the world's largest companies on how to prepare for complex futures. In 2015, she decided to make all of her research open source, freely available to the public. Our ideas about the future are shaped by our own upbringings, world views and cognitive biases. One reason for humanity's continued struggles is our conflicting visions of how the future should look. The solution to that struggle is inclusivity. Sara Wesslin is a Skolt Sami journalist. The Sami are the only indigenous people in the EU. Realising two of Finland's three Sami languages were on the brink of extinction, Sara successfully lobbied Finland's education minister to provide funds for Sami language teaching. She is one of only two journalists broadcasting in the Skolt Sami language in the world. I feel it that Skolt Samis are moving forward. We are very proud of our culture, we are very proud of every single language speaker. I think it's going to be a very powerful culture still, even though we are a minority. Having studied everything from megachurch social media use to whether women are more religious than men, Gina Zurlo is an expert in religion statistics. She is co-director of the Center for the Study of Global Christianity in Massachusetts, US. In a female future, women around the world have complete physical security and can be their own decision-makers socially, economically, and religiously. If you can't see this content, tap here,external The BBC's 100 Women team drew up a shortlist based on names gathered by them and suggested by the BBC's network of World Service languages teams. We were looking for candidates who had made the headlines or influenced important stories over the past 12 months, as well as those who have inspiring stories to tell, achieved something significant or influenced their societies in ways that wouldn't necessarily make the news. The pool of names was then assessed against this year's theme - the Female Future - and measured for regional representation and due impartiality, before the final 100 were chosen.

"Royal Mail is facing its first national postal strike in a decade after staff voted overwhelmingly for action. The dispute between workers and the firm is over job security and terms and conditions of employment. More than 97% of votes by members of the Communication Workers Union (CWU) backed a strike. Turnout was 76%. Strike dates have yet to be announced, but the union could target the annual Black Friday retail sales event in late November and the Christmas post. The CWU says an agreement reached with management last year to raise pay and reform pensions is not being honoured. About 110,000 members of the union were balloted in the dispute. Royal Mail says it has 51% by volume of the UK parcel market. Royal Mail staff lose out in share sale Terry Pullinger, deputy general secretary of the CWU, accused Royal Mail of breaking the ""progressive"" agreement that it reached with the union a year ago. He added: ""Our members take honour seriously and have voted to fight for that agreement against those who now seek to break up the great British postal service in the interest of fast-track profit and greed."" The CWU's general secretary, Dave Ward, urged Royal Mail to enter ""serious negotiations"" with the union. Royal Mail said it was ""very disappointed"" that the CWU had chosen to ballot for industrial action and said it was still ""in mediation"" with the CWU. ""We want to reach agreement. There are no grounds for industrial action,"" the firm said. Strikes at the privatised postal service were averted last year after Royal Mail agreed to raise pay, reform pensions and reduce weekly working hours from 39 to 35 by 2022, subject to productivity improvements. However, the CWU has claimed that the deal is ""under threat"" under recently appointed chief executive Rico Back. Royal Mail has said it is abiding by the agreement and has awarded two pay rises since last year. It also said it had cut the working week by an hour - although discussions with the CWU about further cuts had stalled.

"The BBC has revealed its list of 100 inspiring and influential women from around the world for 2019. This year 100 Women is asking: what would the future look like if it were driven by women? From climate change activist Greta Thunberg, to trans woman Nisha Ayub who was put into a male prison aged 21, many on the list are driving change on behalf of women everywhere. They give us their vision of what life could look like in 2030. Others, such as the ""ghost"" politician defying the mafia, and the footballer battling misogyny, are using their extraordinary personal experiences to blaze a path for those who follow. Precious Adams spent so much time dancing round the living room as a child, that her mum signed her up for dance lessons. She trained at several top ballet schools, including the National Ballet School of Canada, the Princess Grace Academy in Monaco and the Bolshoi Ballet Academy in Moscow. She was promoted to first artist by the English National Ballet in 2017, and won the Emerging Artist Award at the Critics' Circle National Dance Awards the following year. She has been credited with opening up a conversation on ballet dancers being able to wear tights that match their skin tone. My hope for the future is that more and more people engage with the arts. I'd like as many people as possible to find the same joy, freedom, and fulfilment from the arts that I have. Parveena is known as the ""Iron lady of Kashmir"". Her teenage son disappeared in 1990, at the height of an uprising against Indian rule in Kashmir. He is one of thousands of ""disappeared"" there - leading Parveena to set up the Association of Parents of Disappeared Persons (APDP). She says she has not given up hope of seeing her son again, with next year marking the 30th anniversary of his disappearance. The grief of losing my son to enforced disappearance inspires me to struggle for justice and accountability, and I aspire to work towards making the world a better place, especially for women. Known as Italy's ""ghost"" politician, Piera Aiello ran for office with her face covered by a veil due to threats from the mafia. In 2018, after winning her seat as an anti-mafia candidate, she finally revealed her face to the public. She has used her experience of being forced to marry the son of a mafia boss at 14 to advocate for the rights of police informants and their children. The truth lives on. Jasmin is Rohingya, described by the UN as one of the most persecuted minorities in the world. She was born in a refugee camp in Bangladesh just after her father died. Since arriving in the UK as a refugee, she has excelled at cricket, and together with her friends started an all-Asian girls' cricket team in Bradford. This year she was selected to represent England in the first Street Child Cricket World Cup for charity. All I know is the feeling, the sheer pleasure of the motion feels greater when every breath blows with liberation. Contemporary artist Manal AlDowayan's work explores invisibility, archives, memory and the representation of women in her country. From black and white photographs of Saudi Arabia's female workforce, to a frozen flock of birds imprinted with the permission slip Saudi women require to travel. In 2018, the British Museum placed two of her artworks on long-term display in the Islamic Gallery. Every day I am confronted with the incredible brilliance and courage of women around me, and I can only see a better future when these women have their place in society and history. In 2016, Kimia became the first Iranian woman to win a medal at the Olympics since the country began competing in 1948. As a taekwondo athlete, Kimia is credited with ""emboldening Iranian girls and women to push the boundaries of personal freedom"" by the UK's Financial Times newspaper. The 21-year-old is now training three times a day to seek qualification for Tokyo 2020, where she hopes to inspire the next generation of Iranian women in martial arts. In Iran, female athletes face different challenges. But I hope in the face of all the hardships we will continue and never give up. Dr Alanoud Alsharekh is a founding member of the Abolish 153 campaign, calling for Kuwait's ""honour-killing"" law to be scrapped. She works with institutions to improve gender equality in the Middle East, and was the first Kuwaiti awarded France's National Order of Merit, for her defence of women's rights. Training and empowering future female leaders is a major issue that I am doing my part to see resolved in the immediate future, not only in Kuwait but across the region. When war broke out in architect Marwa Al-Sabouni's home city of Homs, Syria, she refused to leave. She has written a book documenting this time, and has drawn up plans to rebuild the destroyed Baba Amr district, in a way that would bring different classes and ethnic groups together. She runs the world's only website dedicated to architectural news in Arabic, and has received the Prince Claus award, which honours âoutstanding achievement of visionaries at the front-line of culture and developmentâ. Without home there is no future. My hope is that we can raise enough awareness to build places for people to which they can truly belong. It isn't an exaggeration to claim that much of the troubles of our time would be diminished through this act. Rida Al Tubuly is one of many women pushing for gender equality - but she's doing it from a warzone. Her organisation, Together We Build It, pushes for women's involvement in solving Libya's conflict. In 2018, she told the Human Rights Council in Geneva that high level UN meetings about Libya's future were failing to include women. The university professor holds a postgraduate degree in International Human Rights Law. Women's future is now, not tomorrow and not the day after. I promote peace at all levels, and I'm confident that women are able to very soon change the status quo in fields historically designated to men, such as peace building and conflict mediation. Tabata Amaral, one of Brazil's youngest congresswomen, came to national attention this year when a video of her grilling the country's education minister went viral. Dubbed ""Brazil's Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez"" by the press, the 25-year-old grew up on the outskirts of Sao Paulo where she lost her father to drug addiction. Dedicating herself to her education, she won a place at Harvard University with a full scholarship, and graduated in Political Science and Astrophysics. As a member of parliament, her main agendas are education, women's rights, political innovation and sustainable futures. My biggest hope for the future of women in Brazil is that our fight for equal rights, for equal opportunities, be so consolidated that the next generation of girls will be born knowing no limits to their dreams. Yalitza Aparicio trained as a primary school teacher, but ended up being cast as the lead in Alfonso CuarÃ³n's Oscar-winning film Roma after accompanying her sister to the audition. She became the first indigenous Mexican woman to be nominated for a Best Actress Oscar for the role. She now advocates for gender equality, rights for indigenous communities and constitutional protection for domestic workers. The ideal future for women is one in which we achieve gender equality; we have the same rights and the same opportunities men have. In the workplace, a future in which our pay is fair and we are compensated for the value we generate - that would be a good start. Born in Lebanon but raised in the US, poet Dayna Ash was shocked when she was advised to hide her sexuality on her return to Beirut at 16. So she founded Haven for Artists, an all-inclusive organisation for artists and activists, and the city's only cultural and creative safe space for women and the LGBTQI+ community. She and her team run the centre for free, allowing vulnerable people to live in the residence and encouraging them to exchange tools, skills, and experience. Freedom is not only ours to demand but to design. Dina is the fastest woman in British history and the first British woman to win a major global sprint title. She took gold in the final of the women's 200m at the World Athletics Championships in Doha, after she had already taken silver in the 100m. Sport allows you to view your body in a positive way as you see the amazing things it is able to do and how it can change. This helps to build self-esteem and leads to healthier lifestyles both in a physical and mental capacity. I want sport to be an area where young women can be unapologetically themselves. NASA's MiMi Aung is responsible for a team designing a helicopter to fly on Mars. After travelling alone from Myanmar to the US to further her education at 16, MiMi is now project manager at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), California Institute of Technology. She is challenged with building an aircraft light enough to fly in the very thin atmosphere of the Red Planet - it should reach the surface in February 2021. My view for the future is continued advancement and innovation of new capabilities. Personally for me, it has been about first-of-its-kind, increasingly capable autonomous systems for space exploration. I believe that critical thinking is key to making major advancements. At 21, trans woman Nisha Ayub was sentenced to three months in a male prison under a provision of Sharia law which prohibits ""a male person wearing women's attire or posing as a woman in a public space.â Since her release, she has been a tireless advocate for the rights of transgender people in Malaysia, co-founding SEED - the country's first ever trans-led organisation - and creating T-Home, which addresses the issue of homelessness for older trans women who are left without family support. She was awarded the US International Women of Courage award in 2016 for her work. Trans people are just as human as everyone. We cry in tears, we bleed red, we have dreams and hopes, we want to be loved and cared for, we have feelings and emotions as we are your own reflection... we are not asking for special rights but the same equal rights as others. Raised on a farm in Uganda, Judith Bakirya became the first of her peers to win a scholarship to a prestigious girls' boarding school, going on to obtain a masters in the UK and a job in the City. But unsatisfied in her work, she quit, using her savings to fly home and found an organic fruit farm, Busaino Fruits & Herbs. Since winning a national agriculture award, she has used the platform to draw attention to women's rights issues, including lack of land ownership, lack of access to education and domestic violence. Working with women smallholder garden owners in innovative ways, honouring indigenous knowledge and developing biodiverse agroecosystems, promotes sustainable food production and nutrition. Branded as 21st Century building blocks, Ayah Bdeir's littleBits company makes kits of electronic blocks that snap together with magnets, allowing anyone to ""build, prototype, and invent"". Already used in thousands of schools across the US, this year Ayah launched a $4m value initiative with Disney to try and close the gender gap in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, (STEM), supplying 15,000 10-year-old girls in California with free littleBits kits. I am on a mission to make sure every kid â regardless of gender, background, or ethnicity â has the skills to invent the world they want to live in. Buddhism is Thailand's most common religion, with some 300,000 Buddhist monks. But female monks - known as bhikkhunis - aren't recognised, and are banned from being ordained on Thai soil. So in 2003, Dhammananda Bhikkhuni flew to Sri Lanka to be ordained, and returned as Thailand's first female monk. There are now 100 others like her. She is abbess of Songdhammakalyani - the country's first ever all-female Buddhist monastery. We still need to struggle to make the ordination of women in Thailand a reality. Feminist medical doctor Mabel Bianco has spent four decades putting women's health, reproductive rights, abortion, and HIV/AIDS on the public policy agenda in Argentina. She has introduced policies to save women's lives - from tackling breast cancer to violence against women - and has been a pioneer of sex education in the face of Roman Catholic conservatism. This year marks her 30th as president of the Foundation for Studies and Research on Women (FEIM) supporting the rights of women in Latin America and the world. I want a near future without women dying needlessly. I hope we will reach a point where women all over the world can decide freely about their lives, their bodies, and whether to be mothers or not without risking death, and are able to live without gender violence. Raya is founder and CEO of the award-winning Awecademy, an organisation with a mission to use education to improve the world. It aims to inspire teachers and students with online learning modules like 21st Century Skills and Cosmic Citizenship, to bring positive change to humanity for the future. I am intelligently optimistic about the future. This is because the future of humanity is not pre-defined or set in stone, but rather it's up to us to create it. We can choose to create a future that is brimming with prosperity, progress, and love. Katie was a key leader on the team that developed algorithms and techniques to recover the first-ever image of a black hole. She started the project as a graduate student, and is now an assistant professor of computing and mathematical sciences at the California Institute of Technology. Katie collaborated with a number of women on the Event Horizon Telescope team to pull off this feat, on everything from instrumentation to black hole theory. My ambition for the future is that we use artificial intelligence and machine-learning methods to design better scientists, who tell us how to go and discover the world around us. After recounting not being able to reach the locks on toilet doors in a candid speech in 2017, SinÃ©ad Burke quickly became one of the world's most influential disability activists. Calling for all design to be more accessible, she has challenged some of the biggest names in the fashion industry - including Anna Wintour - to make clothing more inclusive. This year she became the first little person to appear on the cover of Vogue, and is launching her first podcast, aimed at challenging us to confront our biases and feel empowered to impact the world. As women move into positions that can create systemic change, we must be explicit in our refusal to repeat the cycles of oppression and exclusion that have been indelibly etched into our consciousness and beings. Our approach to redesigning the future must be intersectional. Author of Contraceptive Justice: Why We Need a Male Pill, bioethicist Lisa Campo-Engelstein's work aims to improve women's lives through finding new methods of contraception. She also specialises in improving fertility for cancer survivors. A word after a word after a word is power. (Margaret Atwood) Scarlett is co-founder of The Pink Protest, an online community of activists who supported the successful #FreePeriods campaign to get free menstrual products in schools in England. They have also helped push a bill through Parliament to make FGM part of the Children's Act. Scarlett's book, It's Not OK to Feel Blue (and other lies), brings together high-profile figures to talk about their experiences of mental health and the stigma surrounding the issue. Because the future will not be drawn without them. Delivering post in rural Wales, Ella was shocked by the amount of discarded plastic on the streets. So she started a campaign for plastic-free period products, successfully lobbying manufacturers to make real changes and councils to spend their period poverty funding on eco-friendly products. My hopes for the future are that period products come without plastic, governments make sustainable choices and manufacturers put the planet before profit. British-Indian Sharan is founder and editor-in-chief of Burnt Roti magazine, focusing on mental and sexual health for young South Asians, and LGBTQ rights. Aided by crowdfunding, she published her first print issue in April 2016 and has since launched an online version. The platform hosted the Let's Talk About Sex workshop in London in 2018, to try to end stigma around being South Asian and sexually active. Our conversation around gender has become more visible and we're fighting for recognition of people who identify differently to how they were assigned at birth...It's hard to identify progress with hostile political climates governing our language and accessibility. Salwa Eid Naser stunned the field in the 400m final in Doha this year by running faster than any woman has done for more than three decades. The reigning 400m world champion was born in Anambra State, Nigeria, but moved to Bahrain at 14 seeking opportunities to further her running career. She now represents the Gulf State internationally. I don't fear nothing for the future because it is something I can handle when it comes. I really want to get it all - now I have the world gold medal, I want to keep going and get the Olympic gold medal. Rana el Kaliouby is a pioneer of artificial emotional intelligence, or Emotion AI. Her start-up Affectiva has developed software that can understand emotions by analysing facial expressions through a camera. The technology is being installed in vehicles to detect sleepy drivers. Also a passionate advocate for gender equity in tech and AI, Rana is a World Economic Forum Young Global Leader. She holds a PhD from the University of Cambridge and a post-doctorate from MIT. AI is at an inflection point: it's increasingly acting on our behalf, taking on roles traditionally held by people. As we plan for a future, we need to ensure that diversity of all kinds - gender, race, age, education and perspectives - are represented. When Maria Fernanda Espinosa became president of the UN General Assembly, she became only the fourth woman to hold the position in the body's history - and the first from Latin America and the Caribbean. She has called on governments to put forward billions of dollars to tackle climate change, and announced her determination to fight gender discrimination. I envisage a future where efforts by the multilateral systems have led to the equal participation of men and women in politics, and to the protection of the rights of women who fight daily for jobs with equal conditions, and of women and girls who are the victims of violence. As South Africa faces rising rates of murder and rape against women and girls, Lucinda has emerged as a voice for women. She leads nationwide marches, rallying thousands of women in the streets of Cape Town, challenging government to translate policy into action. Lucinda founded Philisa Abafazi Bethu (Heal our Women), a non-profit organisation offering services including counselling, search committees for kidnapped girls and safe houses for women escaping domestic abuse. My hopes, as a Khoisan woman, are that we will one day be freed from violence against our bodies, and the bodies of our daughters, sisters, mothers and aunties. I hope that one day we will have a female president. For this, I will continue to advocate and rise in pain to power. Sister Gerard is a Roman Catholic nun in Singapore, who worked for three decades as a death row counsellor. Now 81, she has ""walked with"" 18 inmates before their deaths, describing her calling as helping ""people who are broken"". A female future, like any other, would be one filled with kindness, dignity and equality; a world without discrimination or hate, one that's driven by compassion. Overcoming a fear of water after falling into an adult pool as a toddler, Bethany Firth burst onto the swimming scene at the London 2012 Paralympics. Bethany, who has learning disabilities, is now a four-time Paralympic gold medallist and multiple world record holder, and was Britain's most decorated athlete at the Rio 2016 Paralympics. This year she won two golds at the World Para-swimming Championships in London, and was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) for services to swimming in 2017. In swimming I think we've already got good equality in the sport but I'm really pleased to see new innovations such as mixed relay events being included at major events like the World Championships and Paralympic Games and only increasing opportunities to compete on the same stage. Owl - aka Ugla StefanÃ­a KristjÃ¶nudÃ³ttir JÃ³nsdÃ³ttir - is a journalist, writer and trans campaigner. They are the co-director of My Genderation, a film project focusing on trans lives and trans experiences. They also work with All About Trans, a project creating positive representation of transgender people in the media. They co-wrote the Trans Teen Survival Guide, to help empower transgender and non-binary teens. The future must move beyond the oppressive binaries of sex and gender - otherwise we will never truly break free and deconstruct the systems that have kept us complacent for so long. After storming to victory in 10.71 seconds at the women's 100m final in Doha in September 2019, Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce now boasts more 100m world championship titles than Usain Bolt. It makes the Jamaican track and field sprinter the oldest woman to ever win an Olympic or world 100m title - and the first mum to do so since 1995. She carried son Zyon, two, on her lap of honour, saying she wanted to ""inspire women thinking of starting a family"". Finding balance is never easy but we as women get to decide. I never limit myself as to what is possible as long as my body will cooperate. It's important for the future of athletics that women continue to challenge themselves. I am excited to see just how far I can go, even at this stage of my career. At 26, Zarifa Ghafari is one of Afghanistan's first female mayors. The country's president appointed her mayor of Maidan Wardag, where support for the Taliban is widespread. She took the job despite it being too dangerous for her to live there - her office was mobbed by angry men on her first day. In the face of this adversity, she has taken to the streets with free rubbish bags as part of her clean city initiative, and says her goal is to make people believe in women's power. I'm the first female mayor for this war-torn province but I don't want to be the only one forever. I wish there were more women working alongside me in local government and leading departments and I am trying to make this a reality for other Afghan women. Human rights lawyer Jalila specialises in defending women's rights in Pakistan, and provides free legal services to women in poverty. She is founder of We the Humans, a non-profit organisation working with local communities to provide opportunities for vulnerable women and children. She is the first female lawyer from the persecuted Hazara community, and in 2018 she went on hunger strike demanding protection for her people. Looking back into the past leads to the realisation that the entire politics of conflict, war and destruction is interconnected with Patriarchy. This is the time now that the world should accept the future as female; [women] are the symbol of peace, fertility, creation and coexistence. Let the women lead. Tayla Harris is an Australian rules footballer playing for Carlton Football Club in the AFL Women's league, and a professional boxer. Since a photo of her kicking a ball during a match attracted misogynistic comments in March, a bronze statue of her has been unveiled in Melbourne's Federation Square, immortalising the kick in Australian sporting history. She also holds an unbeaten professional boxing record. A tattoo on my right arm reads 'fortune favours the brave'. I got this when I had my first professional boxing fight and moved away from family and friends to live in Melbourne and since this milestone, I've been fortunate to experience things I never would have thought possible. Hollie is a survivor of sex trafficking from Columbus, Ohio, US. She was first sold by her mother at the age of 15 and was enslaved through drug-use for 17 years. With the help of an innovative court programme called CATCH Court - which spots criminals who are actually victims - she was able to escape in 2015. Most women who are sex trafficked in the US are branded with tattoos or scars and she has since transformed the tattoos on her own body. She is working as a legal advocate for victims of domestic violence at a local Columbus court and is at the helm of Reaching For the Shining Starz â a non-profit organisation that helps victims of sex trafficking. Sex trafficking survivors are the most powerful, motivated, and compassionate group of people I've met in my lifetime. The ability to learn to trust, love, and forgive after we've been betrayed and badly abused â often by the people we loved â astonishes me. We genuinely are a resilient group that come back stronger than before. Huang Wensi, 29, is one of a small but growing number of female boxers in China. Challenging traditional stereotypes of women's roles, she overcame postpartum depression to win the Asia Female Continental Super Flyweight Championship gold belt in 2018. She wants to continue to fight social stigma against women in sport. I want to prove that women have the power to move the world. I hope more women are not just defined by their family, but their dream, too. This year, artist Luchita Hurtado landed her first solo show in a public gallery - at the age of 98. Born in Venezuela, and wife of influential artist Lee Mullican, she spent years treating her art as a private diary, before some 1,200 of her works were unearthed while curators were clearing out her late husband's studio. Hurtado's environmental advocacy continues to inform the visual language of her work. We should think before we vote Tired of the pain she suffered wearing heels eight hours a day at work, Yumi decided to vent her frustration on Twitter. Within days, Japan's #kutoo movement was born, with thousands of women sharing stories about being forced to wear heels to work as part of their uniform. Yumi gathered a petition of 20,000 signatures which she presented to the government over the issue. We're still in the situation where lots of people don't even realise there's gender discrimination in Japan, and for the #KuToo campaign too, lots of people don't regard it as an issue of discrimination. I hope people notice this kind of discrimination in our daily lives, and realise men and women are equal. Through a career in journalism and community social work, Asmaa has become the voice of Sierra Leone's voiceless. After learning of the rape of a five-year-old girl, she used her media platform to launch the Black Tuesday campaign, which encouraged women to wear black on the last Tuesday of each month to protest over the increase in the rape and abuse of girls under 12. The movement prompted presidential action to reform sexual violence policies. To all the women out there - we will find ourselves in male-dominated professions. Take the opportunity to stay on and persist. This is how the future holds more of us as leaders. Aranya uses beat poetry to address issues like gender equality, mental health and body positivity. Her performance of A Brown Girl's Guide to Beauty has been viewed over three million times on YouTube. If women joined the workforce the global GDP could increase by $28 trillion. Why are we limiting half of the world's population and their potential? What could a gender equal world look like? And how far are we from it? Katrina Johnston-Zimmerman is an urban anthropologist, working to make cities better places to live in. She co-founded The Women Led Cities Initiative, which aims to bring women's voices to the forefront of urban planning and design. The future of our cities is female because it has to be. Without a greater level of diversity, through women's input and impact on our urban environments, we are at an impasse for the future of these, our manufactured habitats. Dr Gada Kadoda helps women in remote areas use solar power to bring electricity to their villages by training them as community engineers. She was named a Unicef innovator to watch as the driving force behind Sudan's first innovation lab, giving students a space for collaborative working and problem-solving. She is founder of the Sudanese Knowledge Society, which gives young researchers the opportunity to freely interact with scientists and scholars from inside and outside the country. Women's urgent futures depend on mastering liberation tools to enrich our options. Born with a rare condition which left her with missing skin, Amy Karle grew up fascinated by the possibility of what the human body could be capable of with the right technology. Now an award-winning bioartist, her work includes a human hand design made with 3D-printed scaffolds and stem cells. Biotechnology can lead us into a very promising future or irreversible demise. It is of vital importance that we thoroughly and thoughtfully contemplate the range of dangers and potentials and work together to establish strategies to utilise our technology for the best and highest good of humanity. Self-proclaimed 'mother of all Sudanese martyrs', Ahlam's 17-year-old son was killed in a peaceful protest in 2013. Since then, Ahlam has dedicated her life to seeking justice for him, and fighting for the rights of those killed or 'disappeared' in Sudan. She was part of underground forums and protests and was ""brutally beaten"" when caught by security forces. In the movement that started in December 2018 against then-President Omar al-Bashir, Ahlam became a prominent protester, leading rallies with strong ties to the youth on the ground. Sudan will become again an important and powerful country. The young Sudanese have learned about their rights. Once they have become aware of what rights they are entitled to, they will never accept to abandon them. In 2019, cancer researcher Fiona Kolbinger became the first woman ever to win the Transcontinental Race - one of the world's toughest cycling races. Covering 4,000 km in 10 days - from Bulgaria to France - she beat off 264 competitors, the majority of which were male. I hope that one day, nobody will be underestimated because of gender, age, ethnicity or educational background any more â creating a respectful society that promotes confidence and gives equal chances to everybody. Hiyori Kon, 21, is a sumo wrestling prodigy in a country where women are still barred from competing professionally. She was the subject of the 2018 award-winning documentary Little Miss Sumo, which charted her battle to change the rules of one of the world's oldest sports, and give a voice to women in sumo. I would like to give the opportunity for children all over the world to get involved with sumo, and make sumo an Olympic sport. AÃ¯ssata Lam set up the Youth Chamber of Commerce of Mauritania to support young women entrepreneurs struggling to access funding for their start-ups. She is a vocal advocate for women's rights, using her platform to honour exceptional Mauritanian women, and was appointed to the G7 Gender Equality Advisory Council by French President Emmanuel Macron. The time is coming when women's voices cannot be silenced, nor ignored. The time is coming when women's equal participation in today's most pressing issues is necessary. The time is coming when women's seat at the table is non-negotiable. This time is now. Forensic psychology professor Soo Jung Lee has worked on numerous high-profile murder cases in South Korea. Based at Kyonggi University in Seoul, she has challenged the legal system, helping introduce an anti-stalking bill. She believes stalking leads to more serious crimes in many cases, where the majority of the victims are vulnerable women. As a forensic psychologist, I want the future to be a safe place for my children. Fei-Fei Li arrived in the US from China at 16 with no English language skills, working part-time in her parents' dry-cleaning business. Now widely credited as a pioneer of artificial intelligence, the former Google vice president co-directs Stanford's institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI), which is looking at how to develop ethical AI. Li is co-founder of AI4ALL, which is focused on recruiting more women and minorities to build AI. We are on the cusp of the Age of Artificial Intelligence (AI). This new era has the potential to help us realise our shared dream of a better future for all of humanity, but it will bring with it challenges and opportunities we can't yet foresee. My hope is that we will bring more voices, more views, and more expertise to the discussion. An award-winning independent adult filmmaker exploring how women can help shape the future of porn. She has also written a guide for parents on how to talk to their children about porn. Pornography isn't going anywhere; if we take action now, we can decide what happens next. Nominated for BBC 100 Women list by Jameela Jamil and the I Weigh community, Lauren Mahon is one third of the powerhouse trio ""kicking cancer's arse"" on BBC 5 Live's podcast You, Me & The Big C. The campaigner has set up online community Girl vs Cancer to provide young women with information on cancer charities, news on the nuances of treatments and tips for what to buy a bestie with cancer. My hope for the future is that every single female-identifying or non-binary human on the planet stands in their power and purpose. This is how we're going to change the world. Julie is from Tanzania, one of five countries in the world with the highest estimated number Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) births annually. She has dedicated the past two decades to research on treatment for the disease and working to influence health policies so that individuals across Africa can access vital diagnostic tests and medicines. She is trying to establish life-changing interventions including blood transfusion and hydroxyurea, a medicine with strong effects on the bone marrowâ a step towards the treatment of Sickle Cell Disease. Now she is researching a cure using gene therapy. Sickle cell disease research in Tanzania will have a significant impact in raising awareness about a disease that affects many people in Africa and the achievements made to improve healthcare. Lisa Mandemaker is leading the team building a prototype artificial womb, in collaboration with the MÃ¡xima Medical Centre in Holland. It is hoped the wombs will replace incubators for babies within the next 10 years. Social designer Lisa sees design as a tool for debate, to challenge assumptions, question or excite. The beginning of life slowly becomes a domain that we can design, and everyone should be part of the discussion on how we design this. At 16, Jamie co-founded the Zero Hour movement, using social media to organise the first youth climate change marches in 25 cities, including Washington DC. She has since testified before the US Congress alongside Greta Thunberg. The future must be decolonised and re-connected to the ancient wisdom of the Earth we once cherished. Climate change is a man-made problem, which is why women should rule the world. A formidable leader of the Afro-Colombian community, Francia MÃ¡rquez spearheaded a 10-day, 350-mile women's march to the country's capital, to take back their ancestral land from illegal gold miners. After 22 days of protests on the streets, the Colombian government agreed to stem illegal mining in the mountainous region of La Toma. The human rights and environmental activist has faced death threats over her actions, which won her the prestigious Goldman Environmental Prize. My hope is that human consciousness is being raised to understand that we are not masters of nature, we are part of it, and so we must take care of it, in the same way that it takes care of us. After being upskirted at a music festival, Gina Martin launched a campaign to make upskirting illegal in England and Wales. The law was changed this year after an 18-month legal fight. Four men have been convicted under the new legislation so far. Prosecutors say all of the victims were ""simply going about their business on public transport, shopping or attending events when they were targeted"". I spend my time wondering what society would look like if we cared about the things that don't directly affect us. My hope is that, in my lifetime, I get to see that. Sarah is one of Scotland's leading gynaecologists. As a senior lecturer in reproductive medicine at the University of Dundee, she has focused on solving male infertility, to try to stop women being subjected to unnecessary and invasive fertility treatments. I hope that we can harness science, technology, investment and innovation in male reproductive health to redress global inequalities and the current burden of fertility on women. Singer Raja Meziane's political music video Allo le SystÃ¨me! has been viewed more than 35 million times on YouTube. Her anti-government songs tackling social injustice, alleged corruption and inequality have seen her forced into exile from Algeria. Now based in Prague, she is a vocal supporter of Algeria's protests in 2019, which have seen tens of thousands of young people taking to the streets calling for change. To those who oppose us, we say, 'Strike the woman, and you strike the rock'. (Winnie Mandela) Hailed as 'India's space woman', spaceship designer Susmita founded India's first space start-up. A passionate climate action advocate, she uses her business to help monitor and understand climate change from space. I fear that in three to four generations our home planet will not be very habitable anymore. I hope that humanity will wake up to a Greta-esque urgency for climate action. When Benedicte looked around the Democratic Republic of Congo, she could see plenty of raw produce from potato to passionfruit, but still people were living in food poverty. She says supermarkets were full of products originally grown in DR Congo, but exported out, processed with preservatives, before being reimported at expensive prices. She founded Surprise Tropical, a food canteen serving healthy, takeaway food in the suburbs of the capital, Kinshasa. Five years on, the company's online business delivers fresh produce throughout the city. The future belongs to those who see the opportunities behind what others see as problems or frustrations. Based at the International Center for Research on Women, Subhalakshmi has spent over 15 years working to improve gender equality in Asia. Her focus is the rights of women farmers, ending violence against women and improving women's education. My hope for the future is that women will no longer be invisible and uncounted. Women themselves will be organised and will better articulate the work that they do to uphold the entire economy and society. Government data and policy will also respond to the reality of women's work, both paid and unpaid. Trang Nguyen grew up in Vietnam, confronted from a young age with monkeys chained up for sale on the streets and bears held to extract bile for traditional medicine. So she obtained a PhD in Biodiversity Management, and set up WildAct, a non-profit organisation which helps authorities monitor illegal wildlife trade markets. In 2018, it launched the country's first ever master's course in Combating Illegal Wildlife Trade, to help train the next generation of conservationists. People need to put aside their prejudices and work together to gain a better understanding of the issues of conservation and create solutions for the problems that will be effective and long lasting. For the future of nature conservation, it is important that women's voices are heard and their actions are recognised. Van is co-founder of the Will to Live Center, which provides training for disabled people in Vietnam's capital, Hanoi. Her aim is to create an equal working environment for all. She also runs social enterprise Imagator, which employs 80 people, half of whom have a disability. I wish the environment in Vietnam enabled people with talent and devotion to develop, instead of people feeling like they need to move abroad to use their skills. Natasha is a yogini, a female master practitioner of yoga and wellness coach. The body positivity influencer often opens up about her traumatic childhood on social media, after losing her mother at the age of three and being the victim of child abuse. My hopes for the future are that we live in an empowered world for every human being. Equal opportunities and equal basic liberties...everyone working to improve their emotional intelligence and their intelligence quotient. So empathic and consciously aware humans are created. This year, aged 29, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez became the youngest woman ever to serve in the United States Congress. She grew up in the Bronx and volunteered as a campaigner in the 2016 Presidential elections. Against all the odds, she defeated a veteran congressman in the June 2018 primaries, and has since been dubbed the future of the Democratic party. Her trademark look is no accident â she chose red lipstick and hoops for her swearing in ceremony so that ânext time someone tells Bronx girls to take off their hoops, they can just say they're dressing like a Congresswoman.â We are fighting for a future where no person is left behind. When people want to stop talking about the issues that black women face, trans women face, immigrant women face, we've got to ask them, âWhy does that make you so uncomfortable?' Because it's not just about identity, this is about justice. Everyone deserves justice. Nicknamed 'the golden fish', in 2017 Farida became the first woman in Egypt to win a medal when she claimed bronze in the 50m butterfly at the FINA World Aquatics Championships. She won another bronze this year. She gives lectures at universities to inspire the younger generation to pursue swimming, and is training to fulfill her ambition of winning a medal at the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo. My hope for the future is to have more female athletes excel at their sport in order to represent Egypt well internationally. I want them to believe in their dreams and do whatever it takes until it becomes a reality. Ashcharya Peiris was on her way home from work at a bank in Sri Lanka when a bomb blast left her blind in 2000. She lost her job to her disability, but ended up fulfilling her dream of becoming a fashion designer by describing her designs to a seamstress. She was a finalist in Sri Lanka's Up & Coming Fashion Designer competition, and is now a motivational speaker in garment factories, inspiring young women to follow their own dreams. Trials and tribulations in life are nothing but disguised blessings that empower you to achieve your goals. Fashion designer Danit once found herself at a conference with nothing to wear, so quickly designed a skirt on her laptop and 3D-printed it. She wants all women to have the same option. Her entirely 3D-printed collection has been showcased by Vogue and US supermodel Tyra Banks. In the future, I hope technology improves, and women will be able to choose sustainable but still fashionable garments when they get dressed in the morning. Autumn Peltier has been campaigning for clean drinking water for indigenous people in Canada since she was just eight years old. This year, at 14, she was named Chief Water Commissioner for the Anishinabek Nation, taking on the role from her great-aunt Josephine Mandamin. One day I will be an ancestor, and I want my great-grandchildren to know I advocated for them so they can have clean drinking water and have a future. Swietenia founded the Divers Clean Action Foundation to clear marine debris in Indonesia. They now have 1,500 volunteers working across the island nation and South East Asia. She also initiated the #nostrawmovement campaign in the country, which saw the reduction of single-use plastic straws in more than 700 restaurants. Youth are the agents of change, and create change faster, whilst women are the agents in each household, who will make eco-friendly decisions for future generations. Megan Rapinoe is a two-time World Cup winner and co-captain of the US Women's National Team. She led the team to victory in the 2019 Women's World Cup, scoring some of the biggest goals of the tournament. She was named Best FIFA Women's Player 2019. Megan is a vocal advocate for equality in soccer, taking legal action against the US Soccer Federation over equal pay, calling out racism by fans and has become the face of LGBTQ rights in the game. If everybody was as outraged about racism as those who suffer it, if everybody was as outraged about homophobia as LGBTQ players, if everybody was as outraged about the lack of equal pay as women, that would be the most inspiring thing for the future to me. Onjali Rauf was recovering from life-saving surgery when the idea for her first book came to her. Inspired by a real-life meeting between herself and a refugee mother in Calais, The Boy at the Back of the Class is a child's perspective on the refugee crisis and won the Waterstones Children's Book Prize 2019. She is also founder of Making Herstory, which seeks to end the abuse, enslavement and trafficking of women and girls in the UK and beyond. The future for us women seems both a beautiful and a precarious thing. Beautiful because in so many ways, untold stories of just how much women have been sacrificed at the altar of male progression are finally seeing the light of day. But the advancements are fragile too â with outright misogynists and abusers still in seats of power and women still battling wars that our great-grandmothers were battling too. As a graduate student, Charlene Ren created MyH2O, a solution to the lack of clean drinking water in rural China. Now her non-profit platform has created a nationwide water information mapping network, training locals and students to do their own testing so water organisations know where to take action and which communities are in need. The gender ratios are extremely biased in the NGO sector - significantly more women have chosen to serve in a sector that receives minimal funding, resources and acknowledgement yet [they] strive to create a better and inclusive future. Maria Ressa is an award-winning journalist from the Philippines who set up website Rappler to expose fake news. She has received rape and death threats online for being an outspoken critic of President Duterte's violent war on drugs, and has been arrested twice this year accused of 'cyber libel'. Ms Ressa is being represented by human rights lawyer Amal Clooney. For the next generation, the battle is going to be the battle for truth. What's happening to us in the Philippines isn't unique â we are just the canary in the coal mine. You have to shine the light, you have to speak, you have to say what is happening. Writer Djamila Ribeiro is one of the most influential figures in the Afro-Brazilian women's rights movement. Her work focuses on themes including black feminism, racism, and female empowerment. She is founder of the Sueli Carneiro's Seal initiative, which publishes black writers' works at affordable prices. To think about the future, first it's necessary to recognise past mistakes. Only by facing colonialism and its consequences, will it be possible to co-exist with dignity Jawahir Roble is the UK's first Muslim, black, female, hijab-wearing referee. Having come to the UK from Somalia at the age of ten, she discovered a passion for sports which led her to become a referee. She now studies football coaching and management, hoping to complete her degree in 2020. I have two dreams: one day to referee in the Women's World Cup Final and to get as many girls as possible playing football. I urge more women to participate and take up refereeing Professor Saliba is conducting world-leading research on polluted air. She grew up on her family's farm in rural Lebanon, but when civil war prompted a move to the city, she was awakened to the disturbing realities of air pollution. After watching relatives, friends and colleagues develop health complications as a result of exposure to toxic substances in the environment, she hopes her innovative work with a Beirut university will make it possible to address some of the most pressing environmental challenges. Like the positive and negative dipoles defining a chemical bond, and the yin and the yang staging the balance in nature, women and men must co-reign to solve our current and future environmental threats. Nanjira leads the World Wide Web Foundation in its bid to increase digital equality. She looks for solutions to ensure nobody is left behind when it comes to web access, whether disadvantaged by gender or geography. My hope is that we see it happen more and more, and not only when women are 'given' positions to fulfil diversity quotas or clean up messes. We have a ways to go for 'The Female Future' to unleash its true potential to heal the world. Biophysicist Zehra Sayers has been hailed as a beacon of hope for the Middle East (Nature journal) for her success in her contribution to bringing scientists from eight Middle Eastern countries together. During her 15-year tenure as chair of the Science Advisory Committee of SESAME project, she worked with a group of scientists including those from Israel, Palestine, Turkey and Cyprus, under the same roof to found a CERN-like laboratory. She shared the prestigious 2019 Award for Science Diplomacy for the feat. I am very happy to see young female scientists at SESAME today, either as staff members or as users. I believe that SESAME provides several opportunities for women from the Middle East to make their research more visible and their voice better heard. At 16, Hayfa founded not-for-profit Entrcrush, an online platform for future entrepreneurs where they could be matched with donors, and take e-courses in areas like management and accounting. She works with the UN in Tunisia on gender equality initiatives. One day, I want to wake up to find gender equality is real. I will stay out late that night; I will wear whatever I want to, without worrying about being harassed. I will be free to live by myself if I want to; I will earn as much as a man. Computer scientist Noor Shaker left Syria for Europe in 2008 to follow her passion for Artificial Intelligence. After a successful decade in academia, she turned her skills toward entrepreneurial innovation. Motivated by her mother's fight against cancer, Shaker was compelled to bring her knowledge of AI to the medical world. The result is a ground-breaking technique using AI to design new medicines faster than humans. Her work has attracted the attention of some of the top global pharmaceutical companies, and she has been named one of MIT's 'Innovators under 35'. Algorithms can now autonomously improve and provide augmented capabilities for innovation in ways never possible before. This will empower the next generations with tools for early detection and prevention of deadly diseases leading to longer and healthier lives. Inspired by her mum's determination to obtain a degree despite pressure to become a housewife, Bonita Sharma helps educate and empower women and girls in her native Nepal. In a bid to tackle child deaths to malnutrition, she designed Nutribeads, a bracelet for new mums with different coloured beads to remind them what to feed their babies. Her projects have been awarded funding from the UNESCO Malala Fund,  and she has founded her own organisation to empower women and girls: The Social Changemakers and Innovators. There are people in the world who are facing the devastating consequences of inequality in health, education and nutrition right now, and there are women and girls who are working relentlessly to change this status quo. I hope every woman and girl will have an opportunity to reach their full potential in life without any discrimination. In the 1970s, she was part of a movement of women who threw their arms around trees to prevent them being felled - the original 'tree-huggers'. Now a world-renowned environmental leader and winner of the Alternative Nobel Peace Prize, the 'ecofeminist' sees women as the custodians of nature. I hope that women will lead a transition away from catastrophe and collapse, and sow the seeds of our common future. When qualified doctor Pragati Singh started researching asexuality, she received messages from women who didn't want to have sex but were facing an arranged marriage. So she began organising meet-ups for people looking for non-sexual relationships. She now runs Indian Aces, an online community for asexual people. It's time we try increasingly inculcating *feminine* characteristics in our feminism - less 'strong', more 'empathetic'. Lawyer Lyubov Sobol investigates alleged corruption in Russia, documenting her work through social media and a YouTube channel with over a million subscribers. She and other opposition candidates were banned from standing in local elections in Moscow this summer, sparking demonstrations by tens of thousands of young people. To be honest, I don't really think about the future. We live in an unpredictable country. Anything can happen here. But in some long-term perspective I do believe that we will win. We will defend our country. Russia will be free and happy. Samah is a lawyer who has worked tirelessly in difficult circumstances since the war in Yemen started in 2015. She provides legal support to families whose children have 'disappeared'. This year her team at Mwatana for Human Rights managed to reunite some of these families, though she continues to advocate for the release and education of many more children still in detention. The time will come when people will be convinced in the pointlessness of wars. Then change will come, including legislative changes in terms of the rights of women specifically and Yemeni people in general. Self-taught screenwriter Kalista Sy's TV series Mistress of a Married Man sent shock waves through her home country when it was released earlier this year. Dubbed 'Senegal's Sex and the City', the viral sensation features sexually liberated, hard-working and successful female characters who address the struggles of women in West Africa, from polygamy to domestic abuse and mental health issues. Despite everything that women go through, despite all the mistakes they had to make, despite all the 'you can't do this', they know they can rise up, and be the best version of themselves - because the future will not be drawn without them. This summer, 22-year-old actress and director Bella Thorne released her own topless photos after a hacker threatened to leak them, saying, âIt's my decision now, you don't get to take another thing from me.â Bella, who has just directed her first porn film, says the abuse of women online can only change if more female content creators are involved in projects that celebrate sexuality. The female future for me is finally having equality. Women feel this pressure to say 'yes', like it's instinctual. I think that the female future is finally not having to do that anymore. Veronique Thouvenot leads the Zero Mothers Die initiative. It aims to save the lives of pregnant women and their babies through tech, providing women with mobile phones and health information by text. It is run by the Millennia2025 Foundation, of which Dr. Thouvenot is co-founder and scientific director. Help save women's lives with Zero Mothers Die! In August 2018, 15-year-old Greta Thunberg skipped school to protest outside the Swedish parliament. What started as a one-person strike has since spread to a worldwide protest over climate change. Her actions have mobilised activists across the world, with millions of young people taking part in Fridays for Future. This year, she travelled by solar-powered boat from Europe to the United States - an epic journey undertaken to encourage others to reduce their carbon footprint. She has also opened up about her diagnosis of Aspergers Syndrome, saying ""given the right circumstances, being different can be a superpower"". We are facing a disaster of unspoken sufferings for enormous amounts of people. And now is not the time for speaking politely or focusing on what we can or cannot say. Now is the time to speak clearly. Self-taught computer programmer Paola helped reverse 20,000 racially-biased drugs convictions by developing Data for Justice, a tool with an interactive map comparing police activity in white and minority neighborhoods. She won the MIT Innovators Under 35 Latam award for the project. There's still time to use data and technology to redistribute power among those that have been historically forgotten. If we don't do so now, data and tech will only automate the status quo and all the biases and inequalities that currently exist. At 95, poet Ida Vitale is winner of the Cervantes Prize, the most prestigious literary award in the Spanish-speaking world. Only the fifth woman to win the prize, she is the last surviving member of the important Uruguayan art movement known as the Generation of '45. She ends one of her most famous poems, Fortune, with the line ""To be human and a woman, no more, no less."" To have been able to speak and walk freely, and existed without mutilation, and entered churches, or not, and read, heard music that is dear to me, to have been at night a being, as in the light of day. (Fortune, 2005) Purity is a modern day 'senga'. The role traditionally sees aunt-figures training brides-to-be in how to sexually satisfy their husbands. But Purity wants to shake-up the role, helping Ugandan women feel empowered in their relationships. She is calling for all women to have legal rights in marriage. Freedom for women is the salvation of future generations. We cannot continue to live in the past. We need to be loud - there are few women who speak up because they fear the judgement of society. Let's teach these girls to love themselves and believe in themselves. Best-known for becoming New Zealand's youngest member of parliament in 1975 aged 23, Marilyn Waring is a pioneer of feminist economics, and author of the groundbreaking Counting for Nothing, which highlighted the value of womens' unpaid work. An environmental activist, she was also instrumental in the passing of New Zealand's nuclear-free policy. What we decide to measure now is what we will prioritise in the futureâ, âUnderneath the numbers, a philosophical judgement is always being made based on values, not facts."" (Still Counting, by Marilyn Waring) Amy Webb is a futurist who advises government leaders and the CEOs of some of the world's largest companies on how to prepare for complex futures. In 2015, she decided to make all of her research open source, freely available to the public. Our ideas about the future are shaped by our own upbringings, world views and cognitive biases. One reason for humanity's continued struggles is our conflicting visions of how the future should look. The solution to that struggle is inclusivity. Sara Wesslin is a Skolt Sami journalist. The Sami are the only indigenous people in the EU. Realising two of Finland's three Sami languages were on the brink of extinction, Sara successfully lobbied Finland's education minister to provide funds for Sami language teaching. She is one of only two journalists broadcasting in the Skolt Sami language in the world. I feel it that Skolt Samis are moving forward. We are very proud of our culture, we are very proud of every single language speaker. I think it's going to be a very powerful culture still, even though we are a minority. Having studied everything from megachurch social media use to whether women are more religious than men, Gina Zurlo is an expert in religion statistics. She is co-director of the Center for the Study of Global Christianity in Massachusetts, US. In a female future, women around the world have complete physical security and can be their own decision-makers socially, economically, and religiously.

We were looking for candidates who had made the headlines or influenced important stories over the past 12 months, as well as those who have inspiring stories to tell, achieved something significant or influenced their societies in ways that wouldn't necessarily make the news. The pool of names was then assessed against this year's theme - the Female Future - and measured for regional representation and due impartiality, before the final 100 were chosen.

"Harry Dunn died in hospital after his motorbike was involved in a crash with a Volvo Crash victim Harry Dunn's parents have arrived at the White House for a meeting about the diplomatic immunity row over the main suspect in his death. Anne Sacoolas, 42, left the UK just days after the crash which killed the 19-year-old motorcyclist. She has offered to meet Mr Dunn's parents, but they say she must promise to return to Britain first. It is not clear if parents Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn will meet President Trump during their visit. Mr Dunn, 19, died near RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire on 27 August. Prior to the White House meeting, family spokesman Radd Seigertweeted,external: ""The White House have just invited #HarryDunn's parents and I to a meeting this afternoon. Looking forward to getting further answers as we search for #JusticeforHarry."" Radd Seiger (centre) is the spokesman for Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn Earlier, Mr Seiger said the family's lawyers, Mark Stephens and Geoffrey Robertson QC, wereready to launch a full investigationinto the role the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) played in the decision to grant immunity to Mrs Sacoolas. On Monday, Harry's parents gave interviews on US TV after flying to New York in a bid to publicise their case. They hope media exposure will put pressure on the US government to force Mrs Sacoolas to return to the UK. Harry Dunn's family threaten judicial review What is diplomatic immunity? US crash suspect's return 'non-negotiable' Over the weekend, Mrs Sacoolas - who is reportedly married to a US intelligence official who was stationed at RAF Croughton - broke her silence over Mr Dunn's death in a letter via her lawyers. In it she said she wanted to meet his parents ""so that she can express her deepest sympathies and apologies for this tragic accident"". Anne Sacoolas, pictured on her wedding day in 2003 Mrs Sacoolas was said to be covered by diplomatic immunity as the spouse of a US intelligence official, though that protection is now in dispute. On Saturday, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab wrote to Mr Dunn's family to explain that the British and US governments now considered Mrs Sacoolas's immunity irrelevant. He said the matter was now ""in the hands"" of Northamptonshire Police and the Crown Prosecution Service.

"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: ""My call is that the referendum must happen next year"" A second referendum on Scottish independence ""must happen next year"", Nicola Sturgeon has told the SNP conference. Ms Sturgeon confirmed that she will ask the UK government for formal consent by the end of this year. She said Westminster had ""no right"" to block the request, and its opposition to indyref2 is ""not sustainable"". But she stressed any referendum had to be legal if the result was to be recognised internationally. She said this was because her aim was not merely to deliver a referendum - but to deliver independence. Could social care charges be abolished? Brian Taylor: 'A faintly surreal SNP conference' SNP conference: Three questions facing the party SNP 'winning independence economic argument' Ms Sturgeon, who is Scotland's first minister, told delegates at the conference in Aberdeen: ""My call is that the referendum must happen next year. ""And we are getting ready. By the new year, we will have completed our legislative preparations. We are already working to update the independence prospectus. ""And I can confirm today that before the end of this year, I will demand the transfer of power that puts the legality of a referendum beyond any doubt."" The UK government has repeatedly said it will not grant a Section 30 order, which was used to ensure the legality of the independence referendum in 2014 in which Scottish voters opted to remain in the UK by 55% to 45%. Delegates overwhelmingly rejected an attempt to have Plan B debated when the SNP conference opened on Sunday This has led to calls for Ms Sturgeon to outline a so-called Plan B, with some activists and elected politicians arguing that the SNP winning a majority of Scottish seats in an election would be enough for independence negotiations to begin with the UK government. Others have called for an unofficial referendum to be held, similar to the disputed one in Catalonia in 2017 - while the Scottish government's Brexit secretary, Mike Russell, has not ruled out the possibility of a legal challenge to the UK's government's position. SNP election win 'could be independence mandate' But Ms Sturgeon told the conference that the question should not be what the SNP will do if Westminster refuses to agree to a Section 30. She said: ""The question should be demanded of the Westminster parties - what gives you any right to deny people in Scotland our ability to choose our own future? ""The Westminster refusal is not sustainable. We can already see the cracks appearing. ""Just like us, they know there is going to be a referendum. And they know that when there is, Scotland will choose independence."" However, she again stressed that the process ""must be legal"" and must ""allow majority support to be expressed clearly and unambiguously"". She added: ""It must have the recognition of the international community. Why? Because our job is not just to deliver a referendum. Our job is to deliver independence."" Large pro-independence marches have been held across Scotland in recent months Analysis by polling expert Prof Sir John Curtice It is very clear that the SNP now want an early independence referendum, and they are clearly buoyed up by polls that show something of an increase of support for independence - not least among those who voted Remain. But let's just bear in mind the polls are at best saying 50% support for independence. We're still a very long way from the position that we were told not so long ago that the SNP would want to see opinion polls consistently, over a considerable period of time, saying 60% support before they would take the prospect of another referendum. Holding an early referendum is potentially a very risky project. In particular, I think there's a crucial question that the circumstance under which a second referendum might actually happen are ones that are perhaps rather different from the current political circumstances. If we accept - as Nicola Sturgeon implied - that a referendum is only to happen if we get a hung parliament, well, the hung parliament implies that Boris Johnson no longer prime minister so that reason for independence disappears. But also it probably implies that we may have had another referendum on EU membership which might have come up with a different result and therefore Brexit is no longer a potential rallying call for independence. Any Westminster party that wants SNP support if there is a hung Parliament after a general election should not pick up the phone if they ""don't respect Scotland's right to choose our own future at a time of our own choosing"". The Conservatives, Labour and Liberal Democrats should apologise for the ""broken promises"" they made ahead of the 2014 independence referendum. Brexit will ""continue to dominate Westminster for years to come"" regardless of whether the UK leaves the EU with or without a deal. SNP MPs will never vote for any Brexit deal that takes Scotland ""out of the EU, out of the single market and out of the customs union."" Ms Sturgeon said the Scottish government would introduce a new law to establish emergency protective orders which would help to ensure that it is the perpetrators of domestic violence rather than the victims who lose their homes. She said: ""We need to change the reality that for women and their children, often the only way to escape an abuser is to flee their home. For too many, that results in the victims of abuse becoming homeless."" Ms Sturgeon also announced that the SNP will scrap non-residential social care charges for all if she is still first minister after the Holyrood election in 2021. And she said her party would pledge to expand childcare into the school holidays for primary pupils from the poorest backgrounds in its election manifesto. Scottish Conservative leader Jackson Carlaw said the answer from Downing Street to Ms Sturgeon's request for a Section 30 order should be an ""unequivocal no"". And he claimed Ms Sturgeon ""simply wanted to get through what was a potentially hostile conference with a series of vacuous promises which will never be kept, and throw some red meat to the hardliners"". Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said Ms Sturgeon plan would mean ""more division and uncertainty"" and could result in a hard border between Scotland and England. And Willie Rennie, the leader of the Scottish Liberal Deomcrats, said independence would be ""bad for Scotland just like Brexit because breaking up long-term economic partnerships is very hard to do"".

"Harry Dunn died in hospital after his motorbike was involved in a crash with a Volvo Crash victim Harry Dunn's parents have arrived at the White House for a meeting about the diplomatic immunity row over the main suspect in his death. Anne Sacoolas, 42, left the UK just days after the crash which killed the 19-year-old motorcyclist. She has offered to meet Mr Dunn's parents, but they say she must promise to return to Britain first. It is not clear if parents Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn will meet President Trump during their visit. Mr Dunn, 19, died near RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire on 27 August. Prior to the White House meeting, family spokesman Radd Seigertweeted,external: ""The White House have just invited #HarryDunn's parents and I to a meeting this afternoon. Looking forward to getting further answers as we search for #JusticeforHarry."" Radd Seiger (centre) is the spokesman for Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn Earlier, Mr Seiger said the family's lawyers, Mark Stephens and Geoffrey Robertson QC, wereready to launch a full investigationinto the role the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) played in the decision to grant immunity to Mrs Sacoolas. On Monday, Harry's parents gave interviews on US TV after flying to New York in a bid to publicise their case. They hope media exposure will put pressure on the US government to force Mrs Sacoolas to return to the UK. Harry Dunn's family threaten judicial review What is diplomatic immunity? US crash suspect's return 'non-negotiable' Over the weekend, Mrs Sacoolas - who is reportedly married to a US intelligence official who was stationed at RAF Croughton - broke her silence over Mr Dunn's death in a letter via her lawyers. In it she said she wanted to meet his parents ""so that she can express her deepest sympathies and apologies for this tragic accident"". Anne Sacoolas, pictured on her wedding day in 2003 Mrs Sacoolas was said to be covered by diplomatic immunity as the spouse of a US intelligence official, though that protection is now in dispute. On Saturday, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab wrote to Mr Dunn's family to explain that the British and US governments now considered Mrs Sacoolas's immunity irrelevant. He said the matter was now ""in the hands"" of Northamptonshire Police and the Crown Prosecution Service.

"The dedicated Harry Potter section at Primark Tottenham Court Road in London Primark has warned customers not to purchase its products from third parties online as they will be paying higher prices for them than in store. Reports had suggested Primark - which does not have an online shop - was now selling its products on Amazon. However, the High Street chain said that it did not have a commercial relationship with Amazon. ""We encourage our customers to visit us in our stores to find the best value,"" Primarksaid on Twitter,external. ""We do not have a commercial partnership with Amazon and any Primark products which appear on the site are being re-sold by third parties, at higher prices."" The BBC found popular Primark homeware and fashion products on both Amazon and eBay at a mark-up of between 50-75% in price. Many customers took to Twitter to respond to Primark, asking the retailer to reconsider its stance and open an online store as they were unable to visit a Primark store for a variety of reasons.

Primark, which is owned by Associated British Foods, is well known for its very low prices. In the last few years, the retailer has also become known for its merchandising agreements with high-profile film, TV, children's toys and video game brands including Harry Potter, Disney, Game of Thrones, Lol Surprise, Fortnite, Friends, Barbie, Stranger Things, Mean Girls, Peanuts and Garfield. The chain, which was founded in 1969, does not have an online store or offer click-and-collect services for its products. In November 2018, Primark's head of ethical trade and environmental sustainability Paul Lister was asked by MPsto justify how the retailer could afford to keep prices so low, as part of a government inquiry into the environmental impact of fast fashion. Primark's Chip teacup purse was so popular it sold out immediately when it was released He said the fact Primark did not advertise meant the retailer could save up to Â£150m a year. In March 2017, a Â£4 Chip teacup purse that was released in conjunction with the Beauty and the Beast live-action Disney film was so popular that people began bulk-buying the item and selling it on eBay for as much as Â£80. The purse was sold out,externaluntil Primark flooded its stores with the product, bringing its value back down again, and a similar situation occurred with a porcelain teacup version of the product later that year.

"The UK's best-known stockpicker is to quit his remaining investment funds, signalling the end of his multi-billion-pound empire. Neil Woodford was sacked from his flagship fund early on Tuesday, and has now announced he will quit the last two funds. He described it as a ""highly painful decision"", adding his business would be wound down in ""an orderly fashion"". Mr Woodford earned a huge reputation over 30 years of successful investing. At its peak his business managed more than Â£14bn. The so-called ""Oracle of Oxford"" was dismissed from his troubled Â£3.1bn Equity Income fund by its administrators on Tuesday. The fund will be wound up and any cash returned to investors. It follows a series of disastrous investments. That sacking initially prompted an angry response, with Mr Woodford saying it was a decision ""I cannot accept, nor believe is in the long-term interests"" of the business. Neil Woodford's flagship fund to be shut down Investors frustrated as Woodford fund stays locked But on Tuesday evening, in a further announcement, he said he would abandon the last two funds, Income Focus and Woodford Patient Capital and close his investment management business. On Wednesday, shares in the Woodford Income Focus Fund were suspended from dealing amid a rush to pull out investor money, with administrators now considering all options. Mr Woodford said: ""We have taken the highly painful decision to close Woodford Investment Management. We will fulfil our fund management responsibilities to WPCT and the LF Woodford Income Focus Fund and once completed will close the company in an orderly fashion. ""I personally deeply regret the impact events have had on individuals who placed their faith in Woodford Investment Management and invested in our funds."" Mr Woodford built his reputation during 26 years at the City firm Invesco. An investment of Â£1,000 in his first funds would have returned Â£25,000 by the time he left. He set up his own business, and his stellar success meant savers poured millions into his new funds. But several big investments in stock market listed companies performed poorly, and investors began withdrawing money. To compound the problems, Mr Woodford had built up stakes in a number of unlisted technology and healthcare companies he believed had strong growth potential. When the redemption requests gathered pace, he found it difficult to raise money quickly by selling stakes in these private companies. The Equity Income Fund was suspended in June after being crippled by redemption demands. It meant that investors' money would be locked in for months. Ryan Hughes, head of active portfolios at investment firm AJ Bell, said there was ""a feeling of inevitability"" about the closure. Without any money coming in ""it was difficult to see how the business could survive"", he said. The unwinding of any funds will be a long process. Darius McDermott, managing director of financial adviser Chelsea Financial Services, said the situation was ""a mess"" and the flagship fund's closure would make it ""a forced seller of all stocks"". Neil Woodford had been the darling of the armchair investor - but, as one said today, the whole thing had become ""toxic"". Four years ago, he was giving them 20% returns. Now he is giving them losses, a lot of uncertainty, and perhaps a lesson in hubris. Some of those investors will be kicking themselves for being too reliant on a ""star"" manager, rather than spreading their investments, as has always been the advice. The fund manager may soon have found he had nothing left to manage, so commentators say it was inevitable that he has thrown in the towel. Those stockpickers who remain in the ring may find individual investors are a lot more cautious about giving them their support, and their money. Neil Woodford's flagship fund to be shut down Investors frustrated as Woodford fund stays locked 'We trusted Neil Woodford with our money' Woodford faces regulator pressure over fees What went wrong for Woodford and why it matters Top stockpicker suspends flagship fund LA mayor says winds and drought created 'perfect storm', while officials hit out at looters Maps and pictures chart how fires have spread Biden praises Carter's character as former president's coffin heads to Georgia The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

"UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson hopes to persuade MPs to back a deal to take the UK out of the EU. Doing so would implement the result of the referendum of June 2016, in which 52% of voters backed Leave and 48% Remain. But where do voters stand on Brexit now, after more than three years of debate and negotiation? First, no single course of action is preferred by a majority of voters. For example, polling firm Kantar has asked voters on a number of occasions which of four possible outcomes they prefer. The most popular choice has been to remain in the EU. However, this secured the support of only about one in three. The next most popular, leaving without a deal, is preferred by slightly less than a quarter. Much the same picture has been painted by another survey. BMG asked people which of five alternatives they would prefer if a deal is not agreed by the end of this month. None has come even close to being backed by more than half of voters. Should no agreement be reached, the single most popular option is to leave the EU without a deal. Even so, it is still only backed by about one in three. Both of the next most popular options - holding another referendum and reversing Brexit without a referendum, are only chosen by about one in five. Three polls, by Opinium, Panelbase and ComRes have asked people what they thought ofproposals for a deal put forward by Mr Johnson. All three found that slightly more voters were in favour of them than against. However, they were still backed by well under half. In Opinium's poll, just 27% thought the proposals would represent a good deal, while 22% reckoned they would represent a bad one. Brexit deal 'still possible, but more difficult' A simple guide to Brexit What is 'no-deal Brexit'? Most people either said it would neither be good nor bad, or that they did not know. Both Panelbase and ComRes found that 31%-32% support the proposals, while 27%-28% oppose them. But in both cases 41% said they did not know. Against this backdrop, what voters will make of any compromise deal that Mr Johnson might strike with the EU is far from clear. Second, those who voted Remain and those who backed Leave have very different preferences. The single most popular option among Leave voters is to exit the EU without a deal. According to Kantar, at least half of them prefer that course of action. Only about three in 10 pick either of the deals put before them by Kantar: the agreement Mrs May negotiated with the EU, or a ""soft"" Brexit under which the UK will still be part of the single market and customs union. Meanwhile, in the event of no deal, on average nearly seven in 10 Leave voters tell BMG they back leaving without one. In contrast, most of those who voted Remain believe that Brexit should be reversed. On average two in three of them tell Kantar they think Article 50 should be revoked. BMG offered its respondents both the possibility of holding another referendum and of reversing Brexit without a ballot. On average, nearly four in 10 Remain voters say Brexit should simply be reversed, while about three in 10 opt for another vote. Third, very few voters on either side of the argument have changed their minds about whether the UK should leave the EU. The country appears to be just as divided as it was three years ago. On average, during the last month, polls that ask people how they would vote in another referendum suggest that 88% of those who backed Remain would do so again. Among those who voted Leave, 86% have not changed their minds. These figures have changed very little during the last two years. True, most polls suggest -and have done so for some time,external- that the balance of opinion might be tilted narrowly in favour of remaining a member of the EU. On average, this is by 53% to 47%. However, this lead for Remain rests primarily on the views expressed by those who did not vote three years ago - and perhaps might not do so again. In truth, nobody can be sure what would happen if there were to be another referendum. More like this Do voters support a no-deal Brexit? Who would win if a general election were held now? What do voters make of Brexit now? What the EU elections tell us about support for Brexit Fourth, voters are divided about whether any agreement that might be reached with the EU should be put to a referendum. The balance of opinion differs from poll to poll. When people are asked about a ""public vote"" they are more likely to show support for another ballot than when asked about a ""referendum"" on the UK's membership of the EU. But they all agree that those who voted Remain are much keener on another vote than those who backed Leave. All five of the polls put support for another ballot among Remain voters at over two-thirds. In contrast, four of them find that fewer than 20% of Leave supporters are in favour of the idea. The fifth, by Kantar, puts it only somewhat higher, at 37%. So those who voted Remain are much more likely than those who voted Leave to welcome a ballot that might overturn the result of three years ago. Whatever the outcome this week, the division between Remainers and Leavers does not look as though it is going to be easy to heal.

"Royal Mail is facing its first national postal strike in a decade after staff voted overwhelmingly for action. The dispute between workers and the firm is over job security and terms and conditions of employment. More than 97% of votes by members of the Communication Workers Union (CWU) backed a strike. Turnout was 76%. Strike dates have yet to be announced, but the union could target the annual Black Friday retail sales event in late November and the Christmas post. The CWU says an agreement reached with management last year to raise pay and reform pensions is not being honoured. About 110,000 members of the union were balloted in the dispute. Royal Mail says it has 51% by volume of the UK parcel market. Royal Mail staff lose out in share sale Terry Pullinger, deputy general secretary of the CWU, accused Royal Mail of breaking the ""progressive"" agreement that it reached with the union a year ago. He added: ""Our members take honour seriously and have voted to fight for that agreement against those who now seek to break up the great British postal service in the interest of fast-track profit and greed."" The CWU's general secretary, Dave Ward, urged Royal Mail to enter ""serious negotiations"" with the union. Royal Mail said it was ""very disappointed"" that the CWU had chosen to ballot for industrial action and said it was still ""in mediation"" with the CWU. ""We want to reach agreement. There are no grounds for industrial action,"" the firm said. Strikes at the privatised postal service were averted last year after Royal Mail agreed to raise pay, reform pensions and reduce weekly working hours from 39 to 35 by 2022, subject to productivity improvements. However, the CWU has claimed that the deal is ""under threat"" under recently appointed chief executive Rico Back. Royal Mail has said it is abiding by the agreement and has awarded two pay rises since last year. It also said it had cut the working week by an hour - although discussions with the CWU about further cuts had stalled.

"Well that didn't last long. Less than two days after being hit by a massive asteroid and enveloped in a black hole, Fortnite is back online. Season 11 - or Chapter 2 - is now live, with gamers getting used to a whole new map and updated gameplay. Since Sunday night, the game has been offline, replaced by a livestream of a black hole on its Twitter page. But now, there's a trailer to the new season. Allow YouTube content?

Analysis by Steffan Powell, Newsbeat gaming reporter From first glance (bear with me, it's only just got back up and running!) the island looks totally different from what gamers have come to expect. In total there are 13 new locations to explore - before deciding which one becomes your go-to landing spot. The most noticeable change for players in terms of gameplay are the new water based mechanics. From swimming to motorboats - Fortnite has added in ways to play that have been a constant feature in other Battle Royale games like PubG and Call of Duty. Fans will be pleased that the game is live again sooner than some thought - with speculation online that developers had initially planned for Chapter 2 to appear on Thursday. Developers now face a nervy wait to find out how the community reacts to the changes they've made to the most popular game in the world. The way in which the game's makers have managed to build the hype around the update has been a masterclass in modern marketing - now they wait and see if the product they've made will live up to it. The new map For those who don't know - Fortnite allows up to 100 players to fight individually or as part of a team to be the last standing on a virtual battlefield. When the game went down on Sunday night, Forbes' gaming writer Paul Tassidescribed the event as,external""the end of an era"". Fans had been predicting a dramatic finale of season 10 which kicked off in August. The black hole appeared on Fortnite for nearly two days Epic Games - which owns Fortnite - had confirmed ""The End"" event would take place on Sunday 13 October. A countdown timer appeared in the game, above the rocket at Dusty Depot. Players who were online during ""The End""saw an in-game meteor shower,externalwhich appeared to wipe out the Fornite map. These players were then sucked into a rift and the screen was replaced with a black hole in the centre. The launch trailer for Fortnite Chapter 2 racked up more than 700,000 views in less than two hours on Twitter.

"Extinction Rebellion is calling on the government to explain its plan to meet a net-zero emissions target Extinction Rebellion activists are continuing protests despite a London-wide ban by police. The group says it has taken initial steps towards a judicial review of the ban. Lawyers and politicians have also criticised the move. Meanwhile, climate change protesters targeted the Department for Transport and MI5 on Tuesday morning. A government spokeswoman said protests ""should not disrupt people's day-to-day lives"".

Two men briefly sat in the middle of the road before being moved by officers. The Metropolitan Police began clearing protesters from Trafalgar Squareon Monday evening following the announcement of new restrictions under Section 14 of the Public Order Act,which required activists to stop their protests in central London by 21:00 BST or risk arrest.,external The force said it decided to impose the rules after ""continued breaches"" of conditions which limited the demonstrations to Trafalgar Square. Protesters who camped out in Trafalgar Square have now been moved on Extinction Rebellion said it had taken the ""first steps"" towards a judicial review of the Met's ""disproportionate and unprecedented attempt to curtail peaceful protest"". ""Our lawyers have delivered a 'Letter before Action' to the Met and asked for an immediate response,"" a statement read. Tobias Garnett, a human rights lawyer working for the movement, said the letter warned police to withdraw the order, giving them a deadline of 14:30 BST to respond, or else the group would file a claim in the High Court. ""We will be looking for an expedited hearing either today or tomorrow morning,"" he added. There was a large police presence at the Department for Transport The Met confirmed it had received ""pre-action judicial review correspondence"" alleging Human Rights Act breaches. ""The letter will be reviewed by the Met's Directorate of Legal Services, and we will respond to the claimant in due course,"" a statement read, adding it would be ""inappropriate"" to comment further. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has said he is ""seeking further information"" about the decision to impose the ban and why it was necessary. ""I believe the right to peaceful and lawful protest must always be upheld,"" he said. By Francesca Gillett, BBC News ""This is a rebellion, our house is on fire,"" sang crowds of pensioners to the tune of Elvis Presley's Hound Dog as they stood outside the gates of Buckingham Palace. Earlier they gathered on the steps of the Queen Victoria Memorial opposite, singing songs led by two musicians, as police stood nearby in small groups.

Anti-Brexit barrister Jo Maugham QC said the move was ""a huge overreach"" of police powers, while human rights lawyer Adam Wagner described it as ""draconian and extremely heavy-handed"". Mr Wagner added in a tweet: ""We have a right to free speech under article 10 and to free assembly under article 11 of the (annex to the) Human Rights Act. These can only be interfered with if the interference is lawful and proportionate. I think the police may have gone too far here."" Allow Twitter content?

Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott tweeted: ""This ban is completely contrary to Britain's long-held traditions of policing by consent, freedom of speech, and the right to protest."" Allan Hogarth, of Amnesty International, issued a statement saying the ban was ""an unlawful restriction on the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly"". A number of demonstrations have been staged across the capital by Extinction Rebellion, which is calling on the government to do more to tackle climate change. Police remove an Extinction Rebellion protester from Trafalgar Square in central London Protesters gathered their belongings as police removed the last of the Extinction Rebellion demonstration On Tuesday afternoon, the Met said there had been 1,489 arrests in connection with the nine days of protests in London. It also said 92 people had been charged with offences including failing to comply with a condition imposed under Section 14 of the Public Order Act, criminal damage, and obstruction of a highway. Earlier, Parliament Square was closed in both directions due to the protest, but Transport for London said the roads were cleared by 17:30 BST. One protester climbed on top of the railings outside the Houses of Parliament Last week, the Home Office confirmed to BBC News that it wasreviewing police powers around protestsin response to recent demonstrations. Police have the powers to ban a protest under thePublic Order Act 1986,external, if a senior officer has reasonable belief that it may cause ""serious disruption to the life of the community"". Police are also under a duty to balance the task of keeping the streets open with the right freedom of assembly under the Article 11 of theHuman Rights Act 1998,externaland freedom of expression, under Article 10. These rights are not absolute - the state can curtail them. However, the BBC's home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani said: ""The test, if and when it gets to a human rights court battle, is whether police action was proportionate to the threat and only what was strictly necessary."" By law, the organiser of a public march must tell the police certain information in writing six days in advance. Police have the power to limit or change the route of the march or set other conditions. A Section 14 notice issued under the Public Order Act allows police to impose conditions on a static protest and individuals who fail to comply with these can be arrested.

"The UK will continue selling arms to Turkey but will not grant new export licences for weapons which might be used in military operations in Syria, the foreign secretary has said. Dominic Raab told the Commons the UK would keep its exports to Turkey under ""very careful and continual review"". The Turkish offensive, which began last week, aims to push Kurdish-led forces from the border region. Dozens of civilians have been killed in the operation so far. Meanwhile, at least 160,000 have fled the area, according to the UN. The Turkish government wants to create a ""safe zone"" in the area, where it can resettle as many as two million Syrian refugees currently in Turkey. US imposes sanctions on Turkey over Syria attack Bowen: Trump's pullback reshapes war The people caught in the middle in northern Syria Offensive explained in four maps Mr Raab told MPs the UK government had called on Turkey to ""exercise maximum restraint and to bring an end to this unilateral military action"". ""This is not the action we expected from an ally,"" he said. ""It is reckless, it is counter-productive and it plays straight into the hands of Russia and indeed the [Syrian President] Assad regime."" He went on: ""I can tell the House that no further export licences to Turkey for items which might be used in military operations in Syria will be granted while we conduct that review."" It does not mean all UK arms sales to Turkey are suspended - exports can continue under existing licence. But it does bring the UK into line with other European powers which have already said they will block future arms deals. European and Nato allies, including Germany, which is one of Turkey's main arms suppliers, and France have made similar moves. The UK has licensed sales of military equipment to Turkey worth more than Â£1bn since 2013, according to the Campaign Against the Arms Trade. Amnesty International UK said it was the ""right decision"" but should go further. Policy head Allan Hogarth said: ""The government must be clear that this will also apply to all existing licences. ""The UK has a responsibility to minimise the risk of UK weaponry contributing to violations of international humanitarian law."" This video can not be played The BBC spoke to British orphans found trapped in an IS camp in Syria Earlier, Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg discussed the volatile situation in Syria with Prime Minister Boris Johnson in Downing Street. Speaking after the meeting, Mr Stoltenberg said the arms suspensions showed ""many Nato allies are very critical and are condemning the military operation in northern Syria"". He added that he was concerned about how Turkey's actions could escalate tensions in the region, cause ""human suffering"" and threaten the gains made in ""fighting our common enemy"" - the Islamic State group. Concerns have been raised for the future of some British orphans identified as being held in camps in Syria because their parents were supporters of, or fighters in, the so-called Islamic State group. Mr Raab said he did not want to see foreign Islamic State fighters returned to the UK but minors and orphans would be considered.

"Harry Dunn died in hospital after his motorbike was involved in a crash with a Volvo Crash victim Harry Dunn's parents have arrived at the White House for a meeting about the diplomatic immunity row over the main suspect in his death. Anne Sacoolas, 42, left the UK just days after the crash which killed the 19-year-old motorcyclist. She has offered to meet Mr Dunn's parents, but they say she must promise to return to Britain first. It is not clear if parents Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn will meet President Trump during their visit. Mr Dunn, 19, died near RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire on 27 August. Prior to the White House meeting, family spokesman Radd Seigertweeted,external: ""The White House have just invited #HarryDunn's parents and I to a meeting this afternoon. Looking forward to getting further answers as we search for #JusticeforHarry."" Radd Seiger (centre) is the spokesman for Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn Earlier, Mr Seiger said the family's lawyers, Mark Stephens and Geoffrey Robertson QC, wereready to launch a full investigationinto the role the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) played in the decision to grant immunity to Mrs Sacoolas. On Monday, Harry's parents gave interviews on US TV after flying to New York in a bid to publicise their case. They hope media exposure will put pressure on the US government to force Mrs Sacoolas to return to the UK. Harry Dunn's family threaten judicial review What is diplomatic immunity? US crash suspect's return 'non-negotiable' Over the weekend, Mrs Sacoolas - who is reportedly married to a US intelligence official who was stationed at RAF Croughton - broke her silence over Mr Dunn's death in a letter via her lawyers. In it she said she wanted to meet his parents ""so that she can express her deepest sympathies and apologies for this tragic accident"". Anne Sacoolas, pictured on her wedding day in 2003 Mrs Sacoolas was said to be covered by diplomatic immunity as the spouse of a US intelligence official, though that protection is now in dispute. On Saturday, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab wrote to Mr Dunn's family to explain that the British and US governments now considered Mrs Sacoolas's immunity irrelevant. He said the matter was now ""in the hands"" of Northamptonshire Police and the Crown Prosecution Service.

"Scotch Beef is back on the menu in Japan for the first time in 23 years. An order supplied by West Lothian-based processor AK Stoddart was celebrated at a showcase event in Tokyo as part of the Rugby World Cup celebrations. The event, co-organised by Scottish Development International and Quality Meat Scotland, took place in the British Embassy. Japan banned imports of British beef and lamb in 1996 following the outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy. In January it agreed to lift the ban following a meeting between Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and former UK prime minister Theresa May. Farmers welcome Japan move to end British beef and lamb ban Scotch Beef back on menu in Canada Quality Meat Scotland chief executive Alan Clarke said the Japanese market would be worth Â£127m to UK farmers over five years. He said Japanese consumers had ""a hunger for high-value, high-quality Scotch Beef"". Fiona Hyslop said Scotland's red meat sector was ""a genuine success story"" He added: ""Scotch Beef was the first European red meat product to be granted the coveted European Protected Geographic Indication (PGI) status which reflects the unique provenance and quality of this product, and the farming methods behind the production of Scotch Beef are very much part of our Scottish landscape and heritage. ""We look forward to further developing opportunities to promote and showcase Scotch Beef and Scotch Lamb in Japan."" Scotland's External Affairs Secretary Fiona Hyslop, who attended the showcase event in Tokyo, said: ""I'm delighted that the people of Japan can once again enjoy one of Scotland's most iconic food products.

"A woman has received death threats after speaking out about an international cryptocurrency ""scam"". Jen McAdam, from Glasgow, has been leading a band of investors who believe they have been duped by the OneCoin digital currency. OneCoin is said to have raised as much as Â£4bn around the world in investment. But US prosecutors argue that far from being the next Bitcoin, OneCoin is a pyramid scheme masquerading as a cryptocurrency. The scheme's founder Dr Ruja Ignatova has disappeared and is facing money laundering charges. Mystery of the disappearing 'Cryptoqueen' Ruja Ignatova What is Bitcoin? 'How I lost Â£25,000 when my cryptocurrency was stolen' Ms McAdam is one of an estimated 70,000 people in the UK who bought packages from OneCoin but have been unable to trade or fully cash in their stake. The Bulgaria-based firm is still trading and denies any suggestion OneCoin is a scam, claiming it fulfils all criteria of the definition of a cryptocurrency. Ms McAdam is taking part in the'Cryptoqueen' BBC Sounds podcastwhich is investigating the disappearance of Dr Ignatova and OneCoin, and said she has had a torrent of abuse since. The 49-year-old revealed she has received scores of messages, mainly through Facebook, threatening her with sexual violence and death in what she claims are co-ordinated attacks by OneCoin supporters, and has now reported the threats to Police Scotland. She said: ""It is horrible, the abuse is vile and the threats feel very real to me, I'm always looking over my shoulder now. ""It is taking its toll on my health but I will not give up until me and the thousands of other OneCoin victims like me see some form of justice."" At a big event at London in 2016, Dr Ruja Ignatova talked up her cryptocurrency OneCoin to supporters Ms McAdam invested about Â£8,000 of her own money in the scheme, and persuaded family and friends to put in about Â£220,000, before realising she was not going to get the money back. ""I know through the different victims' groups around the world that it is people just like me who are affected,"" she said. ""They invested their life savings, they remortgaged homes and they convinced their friends and family to get involved -and they feel as awful as I do about it all because we were all duped. ""We think there's around 70,000 victims in the UK but it feels as if they are being left behind, nobody here seems interested in this."" Ms McAdam has called on the UK policing and financial regulation authorities to take the issue more seriously. The Cryptoqueen podcast estimates OneCoin has raised as much as Â£4bn from people in 175 countries, with up to Â£96m in the UK alone. The flamboyant leader of OneCoin, Dr Ignatova, disappeared in 2017 and in March this year US prosecutors charged the Oxford-educated businesswoman in absentia with money laundering, with the Department of Justice calling OneCoin an old-fashioned pyramid scheme. New York County District Attorney Cyrus Vance was reported as describing OneCoin as ""an old-school pyramid scheme on a new-school platform"". Investment in cryptocurrencies has soared since Bitcoin was invented in 2008 An alternative to centuries-old forms of currency such as notes and coins, a cryptocurrency is like a virtual token which can be bought and sold on the internet. The currency is not printed by governments or traditional banks but created through a complex process known as ""mining"". The process is monitored by a network of computers across the world which use cryptography for security. Cryptocurrencies can be used to buy goods and services, like traditional currencies, but are also used as investments where people take advantage of their volatile exchange rates. Bitcoin is probably the most famous cryptocurrency but there are now thousands of the standalone digital currencies, withFacebook looking to launch its own too. But as OneCoin has proved, crypto can be more controversy than currency. Research published on 7 October showed that UK regulator the Financial Conduct Authority was conducting 87 investigations into the sector as of September, up from 50 a year earlier. OneCoin has rejected allegations that it is a scam, and states that ""OneCoin verifiably fulfils all criteria of the definition of a cryptocurrency"". It says the BBC podcast series into its business does ""not present any truthful information and cannot be considered objective, nor unbiased"". The company also claims that the allegations made about it around the world are being challenged, stating: ""Our partners, our customers and our lawyers are fighting successfully against this action around the globe and we are sure that the vision of a new system on the basis of a 'financial revolution' will be established"". A Police Scotland spokeswoman confirmed they had visited Ms McAdam and offered her advice in the wake of the anonymous threats against her.

"BFU president Borislav Mihaylov (left) played 102 matches for the Bulgaria national team The president of the Bulgaria Football Union, Borislav Mihaylov, has resigned. Bulgaria Prime Minister Boyko Borissov called for him to quit on Tuesday after the racist abuse of England players in the Euro 2020 qualifier in Sofia. Monday's match, which England won 6-0, wasstopped twice because of racist behaviour by home fans, which included Nazi salutes and monkey chants. The BFU said the move ""is a consequence of the recent tensions"" but did not mention racism in their statement. 'Football family must wage war on racists' Racist abuse 'clear as day' - Mings Unsavoury and sinister - a bleak night handled with dignity by England The statement said the tensions had created ""an environment that is detrimental to Bulgarian football and the Bulgarian Football Union"". It added that ""Mihaylov expresses his firm readiness to continue helping in the development of Bulgarian football in every possible way"". Earlier on Tuesday, the Bulgaria prime minister ""strongly condemned"" the fans' behaviour and called for Mihaylov to resign ""immediately"". ""After yesterday's shameful loss of the Bulgarian National Team and given the bad results of our football, I ordered to end any relationship with BFU, including financial, until the withdrawal of Borislav Mihaylov from the post,"" he added. Before the match, Mihaylov had complained to Uefa about""unjust branding""after the build-up was overshadowed by fears England's players could be subjected to abuse. The Vasil Levski Stadium was already subject to a partial closure for the match after Bulgaria were sanctioned for racist behaviour during Euro 2020 qualifiers against Kosovo and the Czech Republic. Mihaylov, a former Reading goalkeeper, played at three World Cups for Bulgaria and has been member of Uefa's executive committee since 2011. Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin said the""football family and governments"" need to ""wage war on the racists"", after the abuse of England players. Uefa told BBC Sport any action in response to Monday's events would have to follow on from a disciplinary committee, which in turn has to wait for a referee's report. Anti-discriminatory body Fare has called for Bulgaria to be expelled from the Euro 2020 qualifying campaign. Bulgaria boss 'didn't hear' racist abuse How Bulgarian media reacted to football racism Some fans in the Bulgaria section of the stadium appeared to make Nazi salutes After making a pass in the first half, England defender Tyrone Mings glanced over his shoulder and could be heard calling towards the touchline: ""Did you hear that?"" Shortly afterwards, in the 28th minute, the game was stopped. Striker Harry Kane was in conversation with referee Ivan Bebek on the halfway line while a stadium announcement was made to condemn racist abuse and warn fans that the game could be abandoned if it continued. At the same time, England manager Southgate was talking to a number of his players. The game resumed but was stopped again just before half-time. Southgate and several England players were in discussion with match officials before the game was restarted for a second time. A group of Bulgaria supporters wearing black hooded tops - some wearing bandanas covering their faces - started to leave the stadium after the game was halted for a second time. BBC Radio 5 Live reported that some made racist gestures while heading towards the exits. After six minutes of time added at the end of the first half because of the delay, Bulgaria captain Ivelin Popov was seen in a heated debate with a section of home supporters near the tunnel while the rest of the players headed for the dressing rooms for half-time. In line with Uefa protocol, England had the option to walk off the pitch but they continued to play the full 90 minutes.

"Downing Street is playing down reports of an imminent Brexit deal with the EU, saying talks are still ongoing. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure to get a fresh agreement by Thursday's EU summit, but his spokesman said there was ""more work still to do"". EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier had said the two sides must agree the details by the end of Tuesday. But the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg said it was not clear whether a text could be signed off by then. She said Mr Barnier was due to brief EU ambassadors at 1300 BST on Wednesday, after a possible European Commissioners meeting, meaning a new deal could get the ""green light"" from Brussels in the afternoon. The Guardian is reporting that a draft treaty,externalcould be published on Wednesday morning, claiming the UK has made further concessions over the issue of customs and the Irish border. What is Boris Johnson's Brexit plan? Could no-deal still happen? DUP meet prime minister again over Brexit Brexit has a new phrase - difficult but possible The prime minister's official spokesman said: ""Talks remain constructive but there is more work still to do."" Meanwhile, Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said talks were ""moving in the right direction"" but gaps between the sides remained, and it was still unclear whether a deal would be ready in time for the Brussels summit. His deputy, TÃ¡naiste Simon Coveney, said earlier that ""big steps"" were needed on Tuesday ""to build on progress that has been slow"" because there would be no haggling over the details of the text once the summit began. The two-day EU summit is crucial because, under legislation passed last month - the Benn Act - the PM must get a new deal approved by MPs by Saturday if he is to avoid asking for a delay. The UK is due to leave the EU at 23:00 GMT on 31 October and Boris Johnson says that deadline must be honoured. He is trying to hold together a coalition of Conservative Brexiteers and Democratic Unionists in support of his proposed alternative to the Irish backstop - the arrangement designed to keep an open border in Ireland. This video can not be played ""We need to deal with the facts,"" say the Irish deputy PM The DUP leader, Arlene Foster, had more than an hour of talks in Downing Street on Monday night and met the PM again on Tuesday evening for a further 90 minutes. Following that meeting, the DUP released a statement saying it would not give ""a detailed commentary"" but added ""it would be fair to indicate gaps remain and further work is required"". Earlier, Mrs Foster had told the BBC her party would ""stick with our principles"" that Northern Ireland ""must remain"" within the UK's customs union. She dismissed as ""speculation"" claims the new Brexit deal included a possible customs border in the Irish Sea - meaning Northern Ireland would be treated differently from the rest of the UK - saying the DUP could never accept that. Giving the Northern Ireland Assembly a regular vote on post-Brexit customs arrangements - which is reported to have been ditched in response to Ireland's objections - was also important to the DUP, Mrs Foster said. She said it was ""right to give space and time"" to negotiators to try to get a deal, but ""everyone knows our position"". Earlier on Tuesday, members of the pro-Brexit European Research Group attended a meeting at No 10, with chairman Steve Baker saying afterwards he was ""optimistic"" that ""a tolerable deal"" could be reached. BBC Brussels reporter Adam Fleming said the widely-held view there was that the UK was unlikely to be leaving on 31 October, and the question was whether an extension could be short in order to iron out some small issues, or had to be much longer to deal with bigger problems. After updating EU ministers on Tuesday morning, Mr Barnier signalled that he expected the UK to share the legal text of any proposed changes to the withdrawal agreement within hours. He said there was a ""narrow path"" to be trod between the EU's objective of protecting the single market and Mr Johnson's goal of keeping Northern Ireland in the UK's customs territory. While there had been progress, Mr Barnier said there was still a big disagreement about the inclusion of so-called ""level playing field"" provisionsin the political declarationsketching out the two sides' future trade relationship. These provisions would limit the UK's ability to diverge from the EU across a whole range of areas, including competition policy, employment rights, environmental standards and state aid. The UK says loosening these conditions is vital if it is to have an independent trade policy, but the EU says the UK cannot have privileged access to the single market market without following its rules as this would give it an unfair advantage. Asked whether it recognised talk of an EU deadline later on Tuesday, No 10 said Mr Johnson was ""aware of the time restraints"" and the UK was working hard to secure a deal ""as soon as possible"". This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics Regardless of what happens in Brussels, a showdown is anticipated in an emergency sitting of Parliament on Saturday - the first in 37 years, if it goes ahead. MPs will be able to back or reject any deal presented to them and there will be discussions on what to do next. Labour has threatened court action to force the PM to obey the Benn Act, amid speculation the PM could seek to sidestep it somehow. Speaking in Parliament, Leader of the House Jacob Rees-Mogg did not confirm whether the Saturday sitting would definitely go ahead, adding that it would depend on events in Brussels.

"It seemed an understanding had been reached between Boris Johnson and Leo Varadkar last week It's extremely hard to see how a new Brexit deal can still be agreed by this Thursday. Negotiations continue - but time is tight, and, to use the words of even the most upbeat of those involved, ""there's still much work to do"". EU internal talk is focussing now on a possible ""holding pattern statement"" at this week's EU leaders summit, along the lines of ""we've made great progress in negotiations but still need more time"". There are also renewed mutterings about a new Brexit summit maybe towards the end of the month. Is no-deal about to become the PM's policy? What will happen with Brexit in the next four weeks? So how did we get here? At the end of last week there was hope in the air. It seemed an understanding had been reached between Boris Johnson and the Irish Taoiseach (Prime Minister), Leo Varadkar. Now there's lots of speculation, smoke and mirrors - but no sign of white smoke that a new Brexit deal is nigh. ""We felt last week that things would now move very quickly,"" one northern European diplomat told me. ""Now we realise we're still pretty far apart."" Realistically there is no time this week to work out a painstaking middle ground between the EU and UK positions Replacing the Irish backstop guarantee remains the main stumbling block in ongoing negotiations, particularly when it comes to customs. The EU's dual priorities complicate things. Brussels wants: To protect the Northern Ireland peace process - and big EU powers Germany and France say they're delighted the UK and Ireland are now talking about solutions To protect the EU's single market on the island of Ireland after Brexit, and here EU leaders think Boris Johnson's Brexit proposals don't go far enough The European Commission says both sides - the EU and UK - are negotiating in good faith, but the not so secret EU hope right now is that time pressure and political pressure will build on Mr Johnson to such an extent this week, that he might yet blur some more of his red lines. How does the border plan differ from the backstop? Brexitcast: Blame Academy The EU thinking is that the UK prime minister is running out of options. He  promised to do his best to deliver a new Brexit deal this week and he promised not to ask for another Brexit extension. With so little time to go before the EU summit, Brussels believes the only option for a deal is for Mr Johnson to pivot towards an already set-to-go replacement for the current UK-wide Irish border backstop. And this is the EU's preferred option: a backstop that would see only Northern Ireland, not the rest of the UK, following EU customs rules after Brexit, while not affecting its territorial identity as part of the UK. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Now for those who've followed the twists and turns of the Brexit process, you'll recognise the EU proposal as what was formally known as the Northern Ireland-only backstop. Meanwhile, Mr Johnson's offer is reminiscent of his predecessor Theresa May's Chequers plan for two customs systems (one EU, one UK) on the island of Ireland. Each proposal was roundly rejected by the other side. The difference now is the political will to get a deal done. And not just in Downing Street. Those in the UK who claim the EU wants another Brexit extension to keep the UK in the bloc as long as possible are mistaken. EU leaders are fed up with the Brexit process. They want a deal. What is in Boris Johnson's Brexit plan? Divisions continue over opposition Brexit strategy Realistically there is no time this week to work out a painstaking middle ground between the EU and UK positions. And EU leaders are adamant that they won't be negotiating directly with Boris Johnson at the summit. What could no deal mean for the Irish border? 10 ways no-deal Brexit could affect you Germany, France and others say they want a Brexit deal they can live with, rather than something cobbled together in a rush to ""get it over with"" that could leave problems for the Northern Ireland peace process and/or the single market for years to come. While the technical details need to be ironed out (and that cannot be taken for granted), the EU political mood is determinedly more can-do now. If the prime minister balks at doing a U-turn on a Northern Ireland-only backstop, despite being encouraged by still-to-be revealed EU sweeteners, then negotiations towards a hybrid solution will likely pick up again next week. First, though, all EU eyes would be on Westminster and the extraordinary session of Parliament on Saturday to see if another Brexit extension will be requested, or not.

"This video can not be played Thomas Cook ex-boss on bonus: 'It's not up to me' Thomas Cook's ex-boss has been grilled over a bonus payment of Â£500,000 and said he was not the only one to blame for the holiday firm's collapse. Peter Fankhauser told a cross-party committee of MPs that he worked ""tirelessly"" for Thomas Cook. While he was sorry for the collapse, he said the reasons were ""not one-sided"". Committee chair Rachel Reeves, who asked Mr Fankhauser if he would give the bonus back, told Mr Fankhauser his apologies rang ""rather hollow"". Mr Fankhauser and other members of Thomas Cook's former management were being questioned by MPs over what led to the liquidation of the business on 23 September which cost thousands of jobs and left many holidaymakers stranded overseas. Staff back at work in former Thomas Cook shops Thomas Cook buyers pledge to save 555 shops and 2,500 jobs The former chief executive said that he did not receive a bonus in 2018 but had received a Â£750,000 bonus in 2017 - two-thirds of which was in cash, the rest was in shares. Ms Reeves asked Mr Fankhauser if he would return money to repay taxpayers for the massive repatriation programme to bring 150,000 holidaymakers back to the UK and help fund redundancy payments to staff. He said: ""I fully understand the sentiment in the public and I understand the sentiment of some of our colleagues. ""However, what I can say to that is that I worked tirelessly for the success of the company and I am deeply sorry that I was not able to secure the deal. ""But it was not one-sided that I failed. There was multiple parties who had to contribute to the deal which finally then did not succeed,"" he said. Mr Fankhauser said, on reflection, he will ""consider what is right but I'm not going to decide that today"". Watching Mr Fankhauser's evidence has not eased the pain for Betty Knight The pain of losing her job is still raw for Betty Knight. Watching Peter Fankhauser being grilled by MPs brought a tear to her eye, especially when Rachel Reeves spoke of his failings and the damage done to staff and holidaymakers. The former member of Thomas Cook's cabin crew said some of Mr Fankhauser's answers ""were still tinged with arrogance"". She did, though, give him some credit. ""I still believe, in those final few months, they did work very hard to try to turn this round,"" Ms Knight told the BBC. An employee for 13 years, she admits to still being in denial that the company no longer exists. ""But I don't feel as angry as I did."" One thing that still grates, however. Even as Mr Fankhauser explained how management had worked tirelessly, it did not sooth her anger that huge salaries and bonuses were paid out for failure. ""They should have been paid on results,"" she said. ""That's just the way it should have been."" Ms Reeves asked the former chief executive of Thomas Cook why he held on so long for a financing deal to save the company which he ""knew was never going to happen""? Mr Fankhauser said he was ""confident"" it was going to happen: ""Otherwise I would not have tried so hard and I had the backing from the banks and I had the substantive agreement on 28 August from the banks and the bondholders."" This video can not be played Fomer Thomas Cook staff back at work He told MPs that he met with transport secretary Grant Shapps on 9 September and claimed that if the government had backed Thomas Cook's rescue plan, the travel operator would have survived. ""We made an estimate how much could the collapse of Thomas cook cost, that was far higher than what we requested,"" he said, but added ""I honestly don't dare to criticise the government. ""I firmly believe that after the recapitalisation... we would have had a new start"". In the end, he said, the government did not want to set a precedent. ""I was awfully sad,"" Mr  Fankhauser. ""I knew I would have to throw in the towel"". Last week, Sunderland-based firm Hays Travel announced that it would take over 555 Thomas Cook shops, in a deal that could potentially save 2,500 jobs.

"The dedicated Harry Potter section at Primark Tottenham Court Road in London Primark has warned customers not to purchase its products from third parties online as they will be paying higher prices for them than in store. Reports had suggested Primark - which does not have an online shop - was now selling its products on Amazon. However, the High Street chain said that it did not have a commercial relationship with Amazon. ""We encourage our customers to visit us in our stores to find the best value,"" Primarksaid on Twitter,external. ""We do not have a commercial partnership with Amazon and any Primark products which appear on the site are being re-sold by third parties, at higher prices."" The BBC found popular Primark homeware and fashion products on both Amazon and eBay at a mark-up of between 50-75% in price. Many customers took to Twitter to respond to Primark, asking the retailer to reconsider its stance and open an online store as they were unable to visit a Primark store for a variety of reasons.

Primark, which is owned by Associated British Foods, is well known for its very low prices. In the last few years, the retailer has also become known for its merchandising agreements with high-profile film, TV, children's toys and video game brands including Harry Potter, Disney, Game of Thrones, Lol Surprise, Fortnite, Friends, Barbie, Stranger Things, Mean Girls, Peanuts and Garfield. The chain, which was founded in 1969, does not have an online store or offer click-and-collect services for its products. In November 2018, Primark's head of ethical trade and environmental sustainability Paul Lister was asked by MPsto justify how the retailer could afford to keep prices so low, as part of a government inquiry into the environmental impact of fast fashion. Primark's Chip teacup purse was so popular it sold out immediately when it was released He said the fact Primark did not advertise meant the retailer could save up to Â£150m a year. In March 2017, a Â£4 Chip teacup purse that was released in conjunction with the Beauty and the Beast live-action Disney film was so popular that people began bulk-buying the item and selling it on eBay for as much as Â£80. The purse was sold out,externaluntil Primark flooded its stores with the product, bringing its value back down again, and a similar situation occurred with a porcelain teacup version of the product later that year.

"Georgia, Sydney and Kassy all began using e-cigarettes aged 16 Almost 40% of sellers targeted by councils in England have been caught illegally allowing children to buy e-cigarette products, a report has found. Ninety of the 227 premises tested sold vaping goods to under-age teenagers in 2018-19, data from 34 councils showed. Trading Standards - which compiled the research - has called for greater resources to enforce the law. Public Health England said vaping was 95% healthier than smoking. It is estimated 3.6 million people in the UK now use e-cigarettes. Georgia 17, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme she had been to shops where she had been given free e-cigarette tutorials and liquids. She has been vaping for over a year and ""rarely"" been asked for ID. Asked for proof of age the first time she had tried to buy vaping products, she had been allowed to complete the purchase after telling the seller she had forgotten it, she said. The teenager now believes she has experienced negative health effects as a result of vaping. ""I went to hospital, they took my blood and they said there's too much liquid in my lungs,"" she said. ""They gave me some tablets for a course of two weeks. I'm still getting the pain today."" Vaping is seen as safer than smoking because lower levels of the harmful chemicals found in tobacco smoke are produced The Chartered Trading Standards Institute's 2018-19 Tobacco Control Survey shows the proportion of targeted sellers allowing children to buy vaping products has risen 12 percentage points in a year, from 28% to 40%. Forty-seven of the 90 illegal sales were recorded at specialist e-cigarette suppliers. Discount shops had the second most illegal sales, 11, while eight were reported at market and car-boot sales. The figures also suggest sellers are more than twice as likely to allow under-age purchases of e-cigarette products compared with traditional tobacco products, for which 18% of those tested were found to have acted illegally. E-cigarette products can also be purchased online and the Victoria Derbyshire programme has spoken to several parents whose children have bought products while under-age. One mother, whose 13-year-old son bought them on eBay, said it had been ""scarily easy"" for him to do so. She said she felt ""frustration and anger"" towards the retailer because there had not been any age-verification checks. ""We think probably there were terms and conditions he was signing up to when he opened his eBay account, but probably just a tick box, nothing more than that,"" she added. An eBay representative said its sellers ""are required to have an effective age-verification process to prevent the sale of e-cigarettes to minors"". ""Sellers who do not comply will be permanently suspended and we have banned those referenced by the BBC,"" the representative said. ""We have also launched an additional review of seller processes and practices to ensure businesses selling these products are carrying out the required age checks on buyers."" Chief executive Leon Livermore said Trading Standards needed ""appropriate funding and resources"" Leon Livermore, chief executive of the Chartered Trading Standards Institute, said it ""can only do so much"" with its current level of resources. ""I'd say to the government, 'If you want your policies delivered effectively, you need to provide appropriate funding and resources through to the front line,'"" he said. He said he was also in favour of banning flavoured products, which some say lead children who do not smoke into vaping. But this is something Public Health England (PHE) rejects. Its lead on tobacco control, Martin Dockrell, told the BBC there is ""no evidence that flavours are leading kids who don't smoke into vaping, but there is evidence that they are part of what helps smokers to switch"". PHE added: ""There is widespread academic and clinical consensus that while not without risk, vaping is far less harmful than smoking."" Sydney, 17, who began using e-cigarettes aged 16 despite not having previously smoked, told the Victoria Derbyshire programme it was the flavours she was ""mainly attracted to"" and she would ""probably"" stop were they taken away. She said she had begun to spot the signs of addiction. ""I can go days without it but then sometimes I will have that feeling of, 'Oh my God, I feel like I do need the nicotine and the vape,'"" she said. Both Georgia and Sydney also said they had been originally attracted to vaping because of images on social media. They explained it was becoming a ""trend"" led by celebrities. A recent study by King's College London, which looked at online surveys from more than 12,000 16- to 19-year-olds worldwide, found 38% of English respondents said vaping adverts made e-cigarettes seem appealing. This is despite regulations saying adverts can be targeted towards adult consumers only. The UK Vaping Industry Association (UKVIA) told the BBC: ""Products should never be marketed or sold to under-18s. ""We expect the highest standards from our members to show leadership to the rest of the industry. ""We also expect our members to make sure that products are not designed to appeal specifically to anyone under 18 years old,"" it added.

"Google's range of camera and microphone-fitted devices include the Nest Hub Max It's an admission that appears to have caught Google's devices chief by surprise. After being challenged as to whether homeowners should tell guests smart devices - such as a Google Nest speaker or Amazon Echo display - are in use before they enter the building, he concludes that the answer is indeed yes. ""Gosh, I haven't thought about this before in quite this way,"" Rick Osterloh begins. ""It's quite important for all these technologies to think about all users... we have to consider all stakeholders that might be in proximity."" And then he commits. ""Does the owner of a home need to disclose to a guest? I would and do when someone enters into my home, and it's probably something that the products themselves should try to indicate."" To be fair to Google, it hasn't completely ignored matters of 21st Century privacy etiquette until now. As Mr Osterloh points out, its Nest cameras shine an LED light when they are in record mode, which cannot be overridden. But the idea of having to run around a home unplugging or at least restricting the capabilities of all its voice- and camera-equipped kit if a visitor objects is quite the ask. Pixel 4 seeks to reclaim low-light photography crown for Google The concession came at the end of one-on-one interview given to BBC News to mark the launch of Google's Pixel 4 smartphones, a new Nest smart speaker and other products. Mr Osterloh first worked at Google when he headed its Motorola division, until it was sold in 2014 - he returned to the technology giant in 2016 The conversation below has been edited for clarity and brevity. The new Pixel phones have two cameras on their rear for the first time. But is there a risk consumers say: ""The new iPhone and Galaxy S10 have three and some others have four. I'm just going to go with the ones that have more because two doesn't sound that great""? Users are very sophisticated now about their phone purchases. They study them. They'll read the reviews. You're going to live with them for two, three or four years. A lot of people remember from just a couple of years ago, where all the OEMs [original equipment manufacturers] were touting things such as: ""We have eight cores in our device, so it's super-fast."" And then they realised the actual practical mechanics of that were almost none of them was used and it was actually just sort of a marketing specification. Google hopes to once again offer the best low-light photography of any smartphone So, my view is in this market, people don't fall for simple numbers anymore. They look for user experiences and Pixel certainly has a brand that's known for having an absolutely terrific camera experience. The Pixel phone is one of most leaked smartphones. You even tweeted details about its built-in radar in advance. Others go to great lengths to try to keep details of their devices under wraps until launch day. Presumably you don't think that matters? We definitely wanted to take a bit of a different approach in how we launch and reveal elements of the products. Several months ago, we started to disclose a little bit about how the product looked and some of the core technologies. We wanted to make sure people started to get excited about it and understood a little bit about it. Of course, there are other leaks we really would prefer did not happen. And unfortunately that shows a little bit of our adolescence in that we have to make sure we're reducing the amount of unintentional information disclosed. At some level, we're at least happy people care and desire this information. But we do want to try to reduce leaks in the future. There's been controversy over facial-recognition tests carried out on the phone's behalf. To make sure it worked better with dark skin tones, there's been reports a contractor targeted homeless people offering them $5 (Â£4) but didn't properly explain what was going on. Can you address that? Google promoted the Pixel 4's ability to use face unlock with dark skin tones, in a teaser video It was very important for us to make sure the face unlock system works for all different kinds of people, genders, races, et cetera. And as a consequence, we wanted to make sure we were able to get a large number of data points that allowed us to perfect this model in a fair way. So, we went out and did a lot of research in this area. It's come to our attention there may be some methods that were not approved, not how we would do business. So, we're investigating that. We would never find that acceptable. And so we've suspended any data collection until this is straightened out. Just to be clear about what you think is unacceptable. Was it the targeting of homeless people? Was it not explaining exactly what people were testing? Or what? All of those allegations would be different than what we would find acceptable. But do you still plan to retain the data collected in this way for 18 months? I don't know that we've discussed the length of time that we're holding data. But there have been no changes to the programme with respect to data retention. [Note: The Verge reported being briefed about the 18-month limit in July,external]. But some people are going to think if the data wasn't collected with proper consent, surely you should delete it and start again. This is all under investigation. So, I just want to be clear we do not know the full facts of what has happened. But if the investigation concludes people didn't know what they were consenting to, are you going to delete? The best approach here would be to discuss it once we've actually looked into the facts and understood what has happened. There's a lot of concern about facial recognition. You're selling camera-enabled devices that sit in people's living rooms, bedrooms, and on their front doors that use the technology. Do you accept reports about what happened with the Pixel tests help undermine confidence in Google and other big technology companies' use of facial recognition data? The Pixel 4 is the first in the series to have two cameras on the rear There's a distinction between what's being used to train a model for face unlock and facial recognition. There are specific use cases for these different technologies and it's very important to examine each one and determine if they're being used in a way appropriate for local laws and regulations. It is definitely important around the world for what is societally acceptable to be clearly defined in collaboration between tech companies and governments. We want to take a very cautious and thoughtful approach to these technologies. They are very important to debate and discuss and then together we have to clarify exactly what to do. When Amazon recently unveiled its rival Ring smart cameras many expected them to add facial recognition but it decided not to. Do you think we need politicians to act quickly to set standards because there's a growing crisis of confidence? It would be great for regulation to be clarified quickly. The approach we're taking is to try to keep all of this information on devices as much as possible and always keep it private and secure and encrypted. There's certainly a key responsibility to make sure the user's information is protected. But everyone would benefit from clarity of standards and regulation. It is a challenging space to navigate. And it's very important it's thoughtfully navigated.

"Georgia, Sydney and Kassy all began using e-cigarettes aged 16 Almost 40% of sellers targeted by councils in England have been caught illegally allowing children to buy e-cigarette products, a report has found. Ninety of the 227 premises tested sold vaping goods to under-age teenagers in 2018-19, data from 34 councils showed. Trading Standards - which compiled the research - has called for greater resources to enforce the law. Public Health England said vaping was 95% healthier than smoking. It is estimated 3.6 million people in the UK now use e-cigarettes. Georgia 17, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme she had been to shops where she had been given free e-cigarette tutorials and liquids. She has been vaping for over a year and ""rarely"" been asked for ID. Asked for proof of age the first time she had tried to buy vaping products, she had been allowed to complete the purchase after telling the seller she had forgotten it, she said. The teenager now believes she has experienced negative health effects as a result of vaping. ""I went to hospital, they took my blood and they said there's too much liquid in my lungs,"" she said. ""They gave me some tablets for a course of two weeks. I'm still getting the pain today."" Vaping is seen as safer than smoking because lower levels of the harmful chemicals found in tobacco smoke are produced The Chartered Trading Standards Institute's 2018-19 Tobacco Control Survey shows the proportion of targeted sellers allowing children to buy vaping products has risen 12 percentage points in a year, from 28% to 40%. Forty-seven of the 90 illegal sales were recorded at specialist e-cigarette suppliers. Discount shops had the second most illegal sales, 11, while eight were reported at market and car-boot sales. The figures also suggest sellers are more than twice as likely to allow under-age purchases of e-cigarette products compared with traditional tobacco products, for which 18% of those tested were found to have acted illegally. E-cigarette products can also be purchased online and the Victoria Derbyshire programme has spoken to several parents whose children have bought products while under-age. One mother, whose 13-year-old son bought them on eBay, said it had been ""scarily easy"" for him to do so. She said she felt ""frustration and anger"" towards the retailer because there had not been any age-verification checks. ""We think probably there were terms and conditions he was signing up to when he opened his eBay account, but probably just a tick box, nothing more than that,"" she added. An eBay representative said its sellers ""are required to have an effective age-verification process to prevent the sale of e-cigarettes to minors"". ""Sellers who do not comply will be permanently suspended and we have banned those referenced by the BBC,"" the representative said. ""We have also launched an additional review of seller processes and practices to ensure businesses selling these products are carrying out the required age checks on buyers."" Chief executive Leon Livermore said Trading Standards needed ""appropriate funding and resources"" Leon Livermore, chief executive of the Chartered Trading Standards Institute, said it ""can only do so much"" with its current level of resources. ""I'd say to the government, 'If you want your policies delivered effectively, you need to provide appropriate funding and resources through to the front line,'"" he said. He said he was also in favour of banning flavoured products, which some say lead children who do not smoke into vaping. But this is something Public Health England (PHE) rejects. Its lead on tobacco control, Martin Dockrell, told the BBC there is ""no evidence that flavours are leading kids who don't smoke into vaping, but there is evidence that they are part of what helps smokers to switch"". PHE added: ""There is widespread academic and clinical consensus that while not without risk, vaping is far less harmful than smoking."" Sydney, 17, who began using e-cigarettes aged 16 despite not having previously smoked, told the Victoria Derbyshire programme it was the flavours she was ""mainly attracted to"" and she would ""probably"" stop were they taken away. She said she had begun to spot the signs of addiction. ""I can go days without it but then sometimes I will have that feeling of, 'Oh my God, I feel like I do need the nicotine and the vape,'"" she said. Both Georgia and Sydney also said they had been originally attracted to vaping because of images on social media. They explained it was becoming a ""trend"" led by celebrities. A recent study by King's College London, which looked at online surveys from more than 12,000 16- to 19-year-olds worldwide, found 38% of English respondents said vaping adverts made e-cigarettes seem appealing. This is despite regulations saying adverts can be targeted towards adult consumers only. The UK Vaping Industry Association (UKVIA) told the BBC: ""Products should never be marketed or sold to under-18s. ""We expect the highest standards from our members to show leadership to the rest of the industry. ""We also expect our members to make sure that products are not designed to appeal specifically to anyone under 18 years old,"" it added.

"The UK jobs market is showing signs of slowing, after a surprise drop in the number of people in work. The unemployment rate unexpectedly rose to 3.9% in the June-to-August period from 3.8%, after the number of people in work unexpectedly fell by 56,000, official figures showed.

This was below economists' forecasts, which had predicted a 26,000 rise in employment. However, wages continued to outpace the rate of inflation, with earnings excluding bonuses growing at an annual pace of 3.8% ""The UK labour market showed signs of slowing in the three months to August 2019,"" it said. The ONS said unemployment increased by 22,000 to 1.31 million.

""Among the under-25s, the employment rate has actually started to fall on the year."" The ONS said vacancies fell again to 813,000, reaching their lowest level since the three months to November 2017. ""This is further evidence that the underlying weakness in economic growth is restraining labour market activity,"" said Thomas Pugh, UK economist at Capital Economics.

"This video can not be played David Pomphret was recorded inside an ambulance on police bodycam shortly after the killing A man who battered his wife to death with a crowbar during a row has been jailed for a minimum of 20 years. Ann Marie Pomphret, 49, was struck 30 times by her husband David at the stables they owned in Warrington, Cheshire, on 2 November. Pomphret, 51, was found guilty of her murder on Friday after a 10-day trial at Liverpool Crown Court. He hadadmitted killing his wife, but denied murder on the grounds of a temporary loss of control. Passing sentence, Judge David Aubrey told Pomphret he was ""an accomplished liar"" who had woven ""a web of deceit and lies"". He said Mrs Pomphret ""had defensive injuries to both her hands. She must have been pleading and begging for you to stop"". ""You had had enough of her, saw the opportunity that presented itself that night to kill her and did so."" David Pomphret struck his wife Ann Marie 30 times with a crowbar Pomphret told jurors his wife could go from being happy to depressed in minutes and become ""very angry, very quickly"". The couple had gone to the stables to check on their horses when Mrs Pomphret began ""ranting"" at him and he ""snapped"". Pomphret had initially protested his innocence but was ""undone"" after a speck of blood on his socks showed he was at the scene when she died. David Pomphret initially denied any involvement in his wife's death Jurors heard he dialled 999 saying he had found his wife of 22 years lying in a pool of blood, ""very dead"". ""There is brain and blood everywhere, and it looks like she has had her head beaten in,"" he added. The Barclays bank technology expert was arrested the next day and denied any involvement. Pomphret had burned his bloodstained clothes and thrown the crowbar in a nearby pond He was given bail but re-arrested four months later after police found ""airborne blood"" on his socks. Pomphret then admitted manslaughter, but blamed his ""highly volatile"" wife, whose mental health had deteriorated. and claimed a special defence of a temporary loss of control.

"This video can not be played More than seven million people were urged to leave their homes The Japanese prime minister has said typhoon shelters ""should be open to everyone"" - after two homeless people were turned away during the country's worst storm in decades. Typhoon Hagibis brought heavy rain and winds of 225km/h (140mph) to Japan at the weekend, killing 72 people. But when two homeless men tried to use a shelter in Tokyo, they were turned away as they did not have addresses. The case has caused huge debate in Japan - with not everyone sympathetic. As Hagibis took hold on Saturday morning, a 64-year-old homeless man went to a primary school, which was being used as an evacuation centre. The school was in the Taito ward of Tokyo, which includes San'ya - an area historically home to many labourers, and now homeless people. According to officials who spoke to theAsahi Shimbun,external, the man was asked to write his name and address. When he said he had no address, he was turned away. ""I told them that I have an address in Hokkaido [Japan's northern island, hundreds of miles from Tokyo], but they still denied me entry,"" he said. Cleaning up in Kawasaki, Japan, after the typhoon The man said he instead spent the night under an umbrella beneath the eaves of a building. ""I wanted them to allow me into the facility because the wind was strong and it was raining,"" he said. Another homeless man was turned away later that afternoon. As news spread on social media, there was outrage at the shelter's decision. ""Is this a country that's going to host the Olympics in Tokyo? [in 2020]"" asked one Twitter user. ""People from abroad would see this and think this is a terrible country."" The San'ya Workers' Welfare Centre, a charity, responded by opening as a shelter on Saturday night. But others were less sympathetic, suggesting ""smelly"" or ""mentally ill"" homeless people should only be allowed into shelters if there was a separate space. ""If you claim your rights, do your duties first,"" said one Twitter user. ""Can you sleep next to a stinking person?"" asked another. Shinzo Abe speaking in parliament earlier this month Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was asked about the case in parliament and said ""evacuation centres should let anyone in who has come to evacuate"". ""We will look into the facts and take appropriate measures,"" he added. The Taito ward said it would review its procedures to help people without addresses in the ward. Typhoon Hagibis: Satellites show Japan flood rivers Japan deploys 110,000 rescuers after typhoon Japan win gives reason to smile again Analysis by Yuko Kato, BBC News, Tokyo Most of 1,126 homeless people in Tokyo dwell in parks, on the streets, and by the river. Rarely do they mingle with the rest of the population - but the typhoon brought them to the forefront of our consciousness. On Saturday night, as the torrential rain and huge gusts of wind were coursing through Tokyo, word began to spread about the shelter in Taito. Many people were immediately outraged. On the other hand, some voiced concerns about hygiene, while others were concerned about the homeless people's mental condition. Some were simply scared to share the same space with them. Social media also showed up the libertarian streak that has become quite visible in Japanese public opinion. Some even said the homeless shouldn't benefit from public services because they don't pay taxes. Many rejected this - not just in terms of human decency - but also pragmatically, as the homeless do pay taxes when they buy something.  4,555around the country 85%male 1,126in Tokyo 127mpopulation Typhoon Hagibis: Satellites show Japan flood rivers Japan deploys 110,000 rescuers after typhoon Japan win gives reason to smile again LA mayor says winds and drought created 'perfect storm', while officials hit out at looters Maps and pictures chart how fires have spread Biden praises Carter's character as former president's coffin heads to Georgia The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

"The UK will continue selling arms to Turkey but will not grant new export licences for weapons which might be used in military operations in Syria, the foreign secretary has said. Dominic Raab told the Commons the UK would keep its exports to Turkey under ""very careful and continual review"". The Turkish offensive, which began last week, aims to push Kurdish-led forces from the border region. Dozens of civilians have been killed in the operation so far. Meanwhile, at least 160,000 have fled the area, according to the UN. The Turkish government wants to create a ""safe zone"" in the area, where it can resettle as many as two million Syrian refugees currently in Turkey. US imposes sanctions on Turkey over Syria attack Bowen: Trump's pullback reshapes war The people caught in the middle in northern Syria Offensive explained in four maps Mr Raab told MPs the UK government had called on Turkey to ""exercise maximum restraint and to bring an end to this unilateral military action"". ""This is not the action we expected from an ally,"" he said. ""It is reckless, it is counter-productive and it plays straight into the hands of Russia and indeed the [Syrian President] Assad regime."" He went on: ""I can tell the House that no further export licences to Turkey for items which might be used in military operations in Syria will be granted while we conduct that review."" It does not mean all UK arms sales to Turkey are suspended - exports can continue under existing licence. But it does bring the UK into line with other European powers which have already said they will block future arms deals. European and Nato allies, including Germany, which is one of Turkey's main arms suppliers, and France have made similar moves. The UK has licensed sales of military equipment to Turkey worth more than Â£1bn since 2013, according to the Campaign Against the Arms Trade. Amnesty International UK said it was the ""right decision"" but should go further. Policy head Allan Hogarth said: ""The government must be clear that this will also apply to all existing licences. ""The UK has a responsibility to minimise the risk of UK weaponry contributing to violations of international humanitarian law."" This video can not be played The BBC spoke to British orphans found trapped in an IS camp in Syria Earlier, Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg discussed the volatile situation in Syria with Prime Minister Boris Johnson in Downing Street. Speaking after the meeting, Mr Stoltenberg said the arms suspensions showed ""many Nato allies are very critical and are condemning the military operation in northern Syria"". He added that he was concerned about how Turkey's actions could escalate tensions in the region, cause ""human suffering"" and threaten the gains made in ""fighting our common enemy"" - the Islamic State group. Concerns have been raised for the future of some British orphans identified as being held in camps in Syria because their parents were supporters of, or fighters in, the so-called Islamic State group. Mr Raab said he did not want to see foreign Islamic State fighters returned to the UK but minors and orphans would be considered.

"This video can not be played Thomas Cook ex-boss on bonus: 'It's not up to me' Thomas Cook's ex-boss has been grilled over a bonus payment of Â£500,000 and said he was not the only one to blame for the holiday firm's collapse. Peter Fankhauser told a cross-party committee of MPs that he worked ""tirelessly"" for Thomas Cook. While he was sorry for the collapse, he said the reasons were ""not one-sided"". Committee chair Rachel Reeves, who asked Mr Fankhauser if he would give the bonus back, told Mr Fankhauser his apologies rang ""rather hollow"". Mr Fankhauser and other members of Thomas Cook's former management were being questioned by MPs over what led to the liquidation of the business on 23 September which cost thousands of jobs and left many holidaymakers stranded overseas. Staff back at work in former Thomas Cook shops Thomas Cook buyers pledge to save 555 shops and 2,500 jobs The former chief executive said that he did not receive a bonus in 2018 but had received a Â£750,000 bonus in 2017 - two-thirds of which was in cash, the rest was in shares. Ms Reeves asked Mr Fankhauser if he would return money to repay taxpayers for the massive repatriation programme to bring 150,000 holidaymakers back to the UK and help fund redundancy payments to staff. He said: ""I fully understand the sentiment in the public and I understand the sentiment of some of our colleagues. ""However, what I can say to that is that I worked tirelessly for the success of the company and I am deeply sorry that I was not able to secure the deal. ""But it was not one-sided that I failed. There was multiple parties who had to contribute to the deal which finally then did not succeed,"" he said. Mr Fankhauser said, on reflection, he will ""consider what is right but I'm not going to decide that today"".

Watching Peter Fankhauser being grilled by MPs brought a tear to her eye, especially when Rachel Reeves spoke of his failings and the damage done to staff and holidaymakers.

""I still believe, in those final few months, they did work very hard to try to turn this round,"" Ms Knight told the BBC. An employee for 13 years, she admits to still being in denial that the company no longer exists. ""But I don't feel as angry as I did."" One thing that still grates, however. Even as Mr Fankhauser explained how management had worked tirelessly, it did not sooth her anger that huge salaries and bonuses were paid out for failure. ""They should have been paid on results,"" she said. ""That's just the way it should have been."" Ms Reeves asked the former chief executive of Thomas Cook why he held on so long for a financing deal to save the company which he ""knew was never going to happen""?

"The UK's financial regulator has announced a crackdown on the car financing industry which it claims will save drivers Â£165m. The Financial Conduct Authority wants to ban the way that some car dealers and brokers make commission on sales. It said that some dealers make commission on the loan's interest rate, which they set. The FCA said this ""creates an incentive for brokers to act against customers' interests"". Some brokers and car retailers make a commission on the interest rate they charge customers who take out a loan to buy a car. The higher the interest rate, the higher the commission. ""We have seen evidence that customers are losing out due to the way in which some lenders are rewarding those who sell motor finance,"" said Christopher Woolard, executive director of strategy and competition at the FCA. ""By banning this type of commission, we believe we will see increased competition in the market which will ultimately save customers money."" The financial watchdog also said it was proposing to make changes to the way in which customers are told about the commission they are paying ""to ensure that they receive more relevant information"". It said: ""These changes would apply to many types of credit brokers and not just those selling motor finance."" Adrian Dally, head of motor finance at the Finance & Leasing Association, said the announcement was ""good news for the industry and consumers, as it delivers clear rules and a consistent approach to commissions"". It added: ""Many lenders have already moved to the commission models that the FCA is proposing."" The FCA will now consult on the proposals until 15 January next year and plans to publish final rules later in 2020. 'Car payments are ruining our lives' Car buyers overcharged Â£1,000 by dealers for loans Earlier this year, a report by the regulator found that the industry's practice of allowing dealers to set their own interest rates was costing consumers millions of pounds a year. The FCA also discovered that only a small number of brokers that they examined told customers that they might receive commission for arranging a loan. The regulator said at the time that its aim from conducting the investigation was to ""eliminate the harm caused by discretionary commission models"". It said: ""We have found a significant difference in the amount of interest customers pay when taking a motor finance deal arranged through a broker who benefits from a discretionary commission model compared to a flat fee model.""

"Neil Woodford's flagship fund is to be shut down, in a major humiliation for the UK's best-known stockpicker. Mr Woodford has also been removed as investment manager of the fund, which will be renamed. He has criticised the decision made by the fund's administrators, claiming it is not in the long-term interests of investors. Those investors will not get any money back until mid-January at the earliest owing to financial rules. Withdrawals from the Woodford Equity Income Fund have been frozen since early June, after rising numbers of investors asked for their money to be returned. There has been criticism that, in the meantime, Mr Woodford continued to charge management fees to customers. A stockpicker - or fund manager - analyses the potential of different stocks to try to decide whether or not they will make a good investment. Mr Woodford is unusual in that he is as close to a household name as is possible in the world of investing. Investors, ranging from big institutions such as pension funds to ordinary people with some cash set aside, put money into his UK Equity Fund. At its peak, the fund had more than Â£10bn of people's money in it. However, the performance of the fund was hit, followed by an exodus of investors - with the fund's current value now Â£3.1bn. In June, Link Fund Solutions, which runs the fund on Mr Woodford's behalf, decided to freeze the fund. That meant investors' money was locked in for months. What went wrong for Woodford and why it matters Now Link has said: ""After careful consideration, the decision has now been taken not to reopen the fund and instead to wind it up as soon as practicable. This is with a view to returning cash to investors at the earliest opportunity."" It said attempts to sell off Mr Woodford's investments in unlisted businesses had ""not been sufficient to allow reasonable certainty"" for when the fund would reopen. The winding-up is expected to begin on 17 January next year, because rules state that there must be a notice period of at least three months. This is Mr Woodford's flagship, but not only, fund. That is impossible to tell at the moment. The amount depends on how much is raised from the sale of the fund's assets, but most investors will probably get far less than they had once hoped. The initial payment is expected at the end of January, but it could be some time before the process is completed. In a letter to investors, Link said assets ""will continue to be sold over time in an orderly manner"". ""It is not currently possible to predict when the orderly sale of these remaining assets will be fully complete and when the remaining capital distributions will be paid to you and the other investors,"" the letter added. Mr Woodford. who made his name in 25 years of market-beating returns with Invesco Perpetual, clearly disagreed with the move to close the fund. ""This was Link's decision and one I cannot accept, nor believe is in the long-term interests of LF Woodford Equity Income fund investors,"" he said. But some investors say it was an inevitable decision, given the continuing difficulties at the fund which will now be renamed LF Equity Income Fund. Gus Harris-Reid says there was always a risk Gus Harris-Reid, 33, who has about Â£6,000 stuck in the suspended fund, said: ""I am not entirely surprised that this has happened. It is a lesson [to investors] not to put all your eggs in one basket. This could happen to anyone at any time. ""His biggest mistake was that he did not communicate how the fund had changed to a [riskier] strategy."" Claire Jebson and her husband had some of their money locked up in the Woodford fund, which was supposed to be used to help pay for son Sam's university education. ""We were going to sell as soon as we could and take the losses, but I know other people would have hung on thinking it would turn around,"" she said. ""Closing it is fair to everyone. It is time to draw a veil over it."" The Financial Conduct Authority - the City watchdog - said it welcomed ""the removal of uncertainty"" that Link's decision provided. ""We recognise that investors have been concerned about the state of their investment since the beginning of June,"" the FCA said. ""Winding up the fund will allow the return of money to investors through a number of distributions, likely to begin in January 2020. This means investors should receive some of their money back sooner than had the fund remained suspended for a longer period."" However, commentators have questioned whether there is any good news, other than certainty, for investors. ""The decision to close the fund is just one of several possible bad outcomes,"" said Patrick Connolly, from financial advisers Chase de Vere. He said investors should prepare themselves for the possibility of bigger financial losses as a fire sale of the Woodford fund's assets takes place. However, even if the fund had reopened in the future, the investment performance and negative publicity would have meant more investors leaving and very little left in the fund, he said. Darius McDermott, managing director of Chelsea Financial Services, said: ""More clarity from Link is required and the regulator needs to be on the ball today, this week, this month, to make sure that investors don't get hurt any more than they have already. ""This action also makes Woodford a forced seller of all stocks - stocks that the market place and short-sellers are all aware of. It may well mean that less money is returned to investors, so the jury is still out on this one.""

"This video can not be played Watch as Syrian government forces enter town of Ain Issa The US has imposed sanctions on Turkish ministries and senior government officials in response to the country's military offensive in northern Syria. President Donald Trump also phoned his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan to demand an immediate truce, Vice-President Mike Pence said. Mr Pence said he would travel to the region ""as quickly as possible"". The move comes after criticism of a US troop withdrawal from the region which some say gave Turkey a ""green light"". The Turkish offensive, which began last week, aims to push the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) from the border region. Turkey considers the biggest militia in the SDF a terrorist organisation. The Turkish government wants to create a ""safe zone"" in the area, where it can resettle up to two million Syrian refugees currently in Turkey. Many of them are not Kurds and critics warn this could lead to ethnic cleansing of the local Kurdish population. Dozens of civilians have been killed in the operation so far and at least 160,000 have fled the area, according to the UN. A Kurdish Syrian woman cries during the funeral of five Syrian Democratic Forces fighters in Ras al-Ain Some aid organisations have been forced to suspend operations and evacuate international staff over security fears. Bowen: Trump's Pullback reshapes war UK government Turkish halts arms exports The people caught in the middle in northern Syria Offensive explained in four maps Kurdish-led forces have been a key ally of the US in the fight against the Islamic State (IS) group in Syria. They described the US withdrawal, which preceded Turkish action, as a ""stab in the back"". There are fears the destabilisation could risk a resurgence of IS, as thousands of former fighters and their relatives are being detained in northern Syria. Hundreds of IS family members are said to have already escaped from one camp. Facing immense pressure, Kurdish-led forces on Sunday announced a deal with the Syrian government for military support to help repel Turkey. US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced the measures alongside Vice-President Pence in Washington DC on Monday evening. Action was taken against Turkey's defence and energy ministries,external, as well as the ministers of defence, energy and interior, the US Treasury said. The move freezes their assets in the US and bans transactions with them that involve the US financial system. ""The Turkish government's actions are endangering innocent civilians, and destabilizing the region, including undermining the campaign to defeat ISIS [Islamic State],"" the statement added. President Donald Trump has faced mounting pressure to take action against Turkey - a Nato partner - including from Republicans usually loyal to his administration. In a statement posted on Twitter, President Trump also said he would raise tariffs on Turkish steel back to 50% and ""immediately stop"" negotiations related to a ""$100 billion trade deal"" with Turkey. ""The United States and our partners have liberated 100 percent of ISIS's ruthless territorial caliphate,"" the statement said. ""Turkey must not put these gains in jeopardy."" Vice-President Pence warned that the sanctions would worsen ""unless and until Turkey embraces an immediate ceasefire"" and negotiates a long-term settlement on the border. The vice-president also reiterated that the US ""did not give a green light to Turkey to invade Syria"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who leads the Democrats, said on Twitter that the sanctions fell ""very short of reversing the humanitarian disaster brought about by [the president's] own erratic decision-making"". Earlier on Monday, European Union countries committed to suspending arms exports to Turkey but stopped short of an EU-wide arms embargo. In response, Turkey said it would examine its co-operation with the EU due to its ""unlawful and biased"" attitude. Analysis by Mark Lowen, former BBC Turkey correspondent Donald Trump is now sanctioning Turkey for an invasion that he is widely considered to have enabled. By announcing a withdrawal of US troops from northern Syria, President Erdogan was given a de facto green light to move in. The sanctions might appear hefty, targeting senior ministers and hiking steel tariffs. But in reality, they are lighter than expected - and we have been here before. In August 2018, Donald Trump lost patience with Turkey's imprisonment of an American pastor, sanctioning two ministers and imposing 50% tariffs on Turkish aluminium and steel. The Turkish lira plunged to a record low of 7.2 to the dollar. Since then, the lira has somewhat recovered - and appears to have largely shaken off today's measures. The US represents just 5% of Turkey's steel export market. President Erdogan tends to dig in his heels when he feels under pressure. There is no sign of any change of tack by him - yet. Following the deal with Kurdish-led forces, the Syrian army began to move towards the border on Monday. Syrian state media said government forces had entered the strategic town of Manbij, inside the area where Turkey wants to create its ""safe zone"". Turkish troops and pro-Turkish, anti-government fighters were gathering near the town. The deal was seen as a boost for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad as it meant his troops would return to north-eastern areas for the first time since 2012, when their withdrawal to fight rebels elsewhere allowed Kurdish militias to take control. This video can not be played The BBC's Martin Patience explains what's behind the conflict Despite disagreeing with their attempts at self-rule, Mr Assad did not seek to retake the territory, especially after the Kurds became partners in the coalition against IS with US troops on the ground. Apart from fighting IS, the Kurds were fundamental to the US in limiting the influence of rivals Russia and Iran and keeping some leverage on the ground. For now, Syrian forces will not be deployed between Tal Abyad and Ras al-Ain, where Turkey has focused its efforts. The Russian government, a key Syrian ally, said it did not want to entertain the possibility of a clash between Russian and Turkish forces in Syria, and said it was in regular contact with Turkey's authorities. Will Islamic State re-emerge? Orphaned siblings rescued from Syrian camp Turkey v Syria's Kurds explained Your questions answered 'We have no friends but the mountains' President Erdogan insists the operation will continue until Turkey's ""objectives have been achieved"" despite the involvement of Syrian government forces. ""God willing, we will quickly secure the region stretching from Manbij to our border with Iraq and ensure that, in the first stage, one million, and then two million Syrian refugees return to their homes on their own free will,"" he said in a televised speech on Tuesday. The United Nations say 160,000 have fled their homes but the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) say this number could be as high as 250,000 with 70 civilian deaths reported. The UK-based monitoring group say 135 members of the SDF have died in the military operation so far along with 122 pro-Turkish fighters and eight Turkish soldiers. Turkey's Anadolu news agency report 18 civilians have been killed over the border in southern Turkey. On Tuesday the UN Human Rights office called on Turkey to investigate suspected war crimes being carried out by pro-Turkish forces. ""Turkey could be deemed as a state responsible for violations by their affiliated groups as long as Turkey exercises effective control of these groups or the operations in the course of which those violations occurred,"" spokesman Rupert Colville said. The warning came after footage emerged over the weekend that appeared to show summary executions of Kurds, including female politician Hevrin Khalaf.

"BFU president Borislav Mihaylov (left) played 102 matches for the Bulgaria national team The president of the Bulgaria Football Union, Borislav Mihaylov, has resigned. Bulgaria Prime Minister Boyko Borissov called for him to quit on Tuesday after the racist abuse of England players in the Euro 2020 qualifier in Sofia. Monday's match, which England won 6-0, wasstopped twice because of racist behaviour by home fans, which included Nazi salutes and monkey chants. The BFU said the move ""is a consequence of the recent tensions"" but did not mention racism in their statement. 'Football family must wage war on racists' Racist abuse 'clear as day' - Mings Unsavoury and sinister - a bleak night handled with dignity by England The statement said the tensions had created ""an environment that is detrimental to Bulgarian football and the Bulgarian Football Union"". It added that ""Mihaylov expresses his firm readiness to continue helping in the development of Bulgarian football in every possible way"". Earlier on Tuesday, the Bulgaria prime minister ""strongly condemned"" the fans' behaviour and called for Mihaylov to resign ""immediately"". ""After yesterday's shameful loss of the Bulgarian National Team and given the bad results of our football, I ordered to end any relationship with BFU, including financial, until the withdrawal of Borislav Mihaylov from the post,"" he added. Before the match, Mihaylov had complained to Uefa about""unjust branding""after the build-up was overshadowed by fears England's players could be subjected to abuse. The Vasil Levski Stadium was already subject to a partial closure for the match after Bulgaria were sanctioned for racist behaviour during Euro 2020 qualifiers against Kosovo and the Czech Republic. Mihaylov, a former Reading goalkeeper, played at three World Cups for Bulgaria and has been member of Uefa's executive committee since 2011. Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin said the""football family and governments"" need to ""wage war on the racists"", after the abuse of England players. Uefa told BBC Sport any action in response to Monday's events would have to follow on from a disciplinary committee, which in turn has to wait for a referee's report. Anti-discriminatory body Fare has called for Bulgaria to be expelled from the Euro 2020 qualifying campaign. Bulgaria boss 'didn't hear' racist abuse How Bulgarian media reacted to football racism Some fans in the Bulgaria section of the stadium appeared to make Nazi salutes After making a pass in the first half, England defender Tyrone Mings glanced over his shoulder and could be heard calling towards the touchline: ""Did you hear that?"" Shortly afterwards, in the 28th minute, the game was stopped. Striker Harry Kane was in conversation with referee Ivan Bebek on the halfway line while a stadium announcement was made to condemn racist abuse and warn fans that the game could be abandoned if it continued. At the same time, England manager Southgate was talking to a number of his players. The game resumed but was stopped again just before half-time. Southgate and several England players were in discussion with match officials before the game was restarted for a second time. A group of Bulgaria supporters wearing black hooded tops - some wearing bandanas covering their faces - started to leave the stadium after the game was halted for a second time. BBC Radio 5 Live reported that some made racist gestures while heading towards the exits. After six minutes of time added at the end of the first half because of the delay, Bulgaria captain Ivelin Popov was seen in a heated debate with a section of home supporters near the tunnel while the rest of the players headed for the dressing rooms for half-time. In line with Uefa protocol, England had the option to walk off the pitch but they continued to play the full 90 minutes.

"A bill to tackle environmental priorities is to be published by the government later. It aims to improve air and water quality, tackle plastic pollution, restore wildlife, and protect the climate. Environmentalists have welcomed several of the proposals, especially on restoring nature. But they say on other green issues ministers are going backwards - and they're anxious to see details of the new policies. Under EU rules, for instance, the government has faced heavy fines for failing to meet air quality standards. With Brexit set to remove the stick of these rules, an independent watchdog, the Office for Environmental Protection, is being created to hold the government to account. Ministers say the watchdog won't be able to fine the government if it fails to uphold its commitments - but will ensure it is held to account, with the ability to stop projects and hold authorities in contempt of court if they breach environmental standards. But campaigners fear that the new watchdog could be muzzled, tamed and stripped of funding. 'Only big changes' will tackle climate change Plastic bag sales in England halved in past year Estate agents urged to tell buyers about pollution Conservative peer Lord Randall - a green adviser to former prime minister Theresa May - told BBC News that the Treasury appeared to have relaxed its objections to a powerful independent watchdog. But he said it would still be useful if the new body could fine the government for environmental transgressions. ""I can see it might look silly if one government body fines another, but it would be a very powerful weapon,"" he said. Crucially, policy details of the bill have not yet been released. Take air pollution. Many parts of the UK breach World Health Organization standards for fine pollution airborne particles. The government promises an ""ambitious, legally binding"" target to reduce small particulate matter, known as PM2.5. But so far, it hasn't stated what the standards would be, or when they would apply. Previously, it was forced to improve nitrogen oxides pollution under the threat of fines from the EU. The new watchdog won't have the power to issue fines. Also, it looks as though ministers are preparing to avoid controversial national measures by giving local councils the job of cleaning up the air. On waste, Mrs May's government signed up to the EU's ""circular economy"" directive, which would see producers pay 80% of the costs for disposing of the packaging that wraps their goods. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has told the EU that the UK will have separate ""ambitious"" standards after Brexit. Does that mean the UK will stick to, or exceed, the 80% target? On plastics, ministers are preparing to introduce charges on single-use plastics, like the plastic bag tax. But environmentalists complain that doesn't go far enough. Libby Peake, from Greener UK - a coalition of pressure groups - told the BBC: ""We have got to be smarter about this. ""People are already turning to glass and aluminium drinks containers, which have more impact on the climate. ""The government needs to take wider action to curb the throwaway society."" On wildlife, ministers will follow the advice of conservationists and create nature recovery networks across the country. In the meantime, the government has been slipping away from its legally binding targets on the emissions that are over-heating the climate. The government's climate advisers recently called for higher taxes for frequent flyers Ministers are still committed to aviation expansion, fracking, North Sea drilling, building roads that experts say will generate traffic, blocking onshore wind power, and cutting support for home insulation and solar. The government will respond later to a rebuke from the Committee on Climate Change (CCC) that they're not moving fast enough. The government's bill makes it clear that the new environmental watchdog will have more power over ministers than the CCC. The bill refers only to England, but many of its measures are designed to apply across the UK. Environment Secretary Theresa Villiers said: ""Our natural environment is a vital shared resource and the need to act to secure it for generations to come is clear. ""Our landmark Environment Bill leads a green transformation that will help our country to thrive. ""Crucially, it also ensures that after Brexit, environmental ambition and accountability are placed more clearly than ever at the heart of government."" Joan Edwards from the Wildlife Trusts broadly welcomed the bill's emphasis on nature recovery, but she raised a host of questions about the green watchdog. She asked: ""Will it be funded with multi-year budgets? Will MPs be able to vet the chairperson of the body? What duty is there on ministers from all departments to set environmental targets? Will the watchdog be fully independent of government?"" Tanya Steele, from the WWF, said: ""Public concern for the environment has never been higher as we face a nature and climate emergency. ""Legally binding targets to protect and restore nature at home are welcome, but around the world our forests are burning and wildlife is being wiped out."" She added that the bill did not address the role the UK is playing in driving the destruction of nature overseas. ""We must also reduce and reverse the UK's negative impact on nature abroad and remove deforestation from the supply chains of foods we eat and things we buy."" Commenting on the bill, shadow environment secretary Sue Hayman said: ""Boris Johnson is threatening our environment with reckless new trade agreements that would undercut Britain's environmental standards."" She called on the government to ensure ""the UK won't fall behind the EU on environmental standards"".

"This video can not be played Harry Dunn suspect ""should do the right thing"" Harry Dunn's family are asking the government to turn over all documents it has about the diplomatic immunity status of the suspect in the teenager's death. Anne Sacoolas, 42, left the UK just days after a road crash which killed the 19-year-old motorcyclist. A Dunn family spokesman said if the advice was not disclosed they would launch a judicial review. Mr Dunn, 19, died near RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire on 27 August. Family spokesman Radd Seiger said their lawyers, Mark Stephens and Geoffrey Robertson QC, were ready to launch a full investigation into the role the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) played in the decision to grant immunity to Mrs Sacoolas. Harry Dunn died in hospital after his motorbike was involved in a crash with a Volvo Mr Seiger said: ""What Mark [Stephens] and I are going to do, is we are going to write to the FCO very shortly, explaining that we don't want to do a judicial review, but to avoid that, please let us have the following documents - all e-mails, messages and notes in relation to your advice to Northamptonshire Police that this lady had it [diplomatic immunity]. ""What we don't know is whether somebody cocked up or whether they were put under pressure by the Americans to concede. ""But we want to conduct an investigation into the FCO's decision to advise Northamptonshire Police that this lady had the benefit of diplomatic immunity. ""If we're not satisfied, then we'll go to a judicial review and ask a High Court judge to review it all."" Radd Seiger (centre) is the spokesman for Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn On Monday, Harry's parents Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn gave interviews on US TV after flying to New York in a bid to publicise their case. They hope media exposure will put pressure on the US government to force Mrs Sacoolas to return to the UK. Over the weekend Mrs Sacoolas - who is reportedly married to a US intelligence official who was stationed at RAF Croughton - broke her silence over Mr Dunn's death in a letter via her lawyers. In it she said she wanted to meet his parents ""so that she can express her deepest sympathies and apologies for this tragic accident"". Anne Sacoolas, pictured on her wedding day in 2003 Mrs Sacoolas was said to be covered by diplomatic immunity as the spouse of a US intelligence official, though that protection is now in dispute. On Saturday, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab wrote to Mr Dunn's family to explain that the British and US governments now considered Mrs Sacoolas's immunity irrelevant. He said the matter was now ""in the hands"" of Northamptonshire Police and the Crown Prosecution Service. US crash suspect's return 'non-negotiable' What is diplomatic immunity? US diplomat's wife 'devastated' by death The letter was sent three days after a meeting between the Dunn family and Mr Raab, who was described as ""twitchy"" by Mr Seiger. ""He [Mr Raab] was stiff, he was cold, he was unpleasant, he was rude. Harry's parents described the meeting as ""terrible"" and said Mr Rabb was ""adamant that Mrs Sacoolas did have immunity"". ""We do not know what is going on but the matter is now in the hands of our legal team,"" they added.

"Downing Street is playing down reports of an imminent Brexit deal with the EU, saying talks are still ongoing. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure to get a fresh agreement by Thursday's EU summit, but his spokesman said there was ""more work still to do"". EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier had said the two sides must agree the details by the end of Tuesday. But the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg said it was not clear whether a text could be signed off by then. She said Mr Barnier was due to brief EU ambassadors at 1300 BST on Wednesday, after a possible European Commissioners meeting, meaning a new deal could get the ""green light"" from Brussels in the afternoon. The Guardian is reporting that a draft treaty,externalcould be published on Wednesday morning, claiming the UK has made further concessions over the issue of customs and the Irish border. What is Boris Johnson's Brexit plan? Could no-deal still happen? DUP meet prime minister again over Brexit Brexit has a new phrase - difficult but possible The prime minister's official spokesman said: ""Talks remain constructive but there is more work still to do."" Meanwhile, Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said talks were ""moving in the right direction"" but gaps between the sides remained, and it was still unclear whether a deal would be ready in time for the Brussels summit. His deputy, TÃ¡naiste Simon Coveney, said earlier that ""big steps"" were needed on Tuesday ""to build on progress that has been slow"" because there would be no haggling over the details of the text once the summit began. The two-day EU summit is crucial because, under legislation passed last month - the Benn Act - the PM must get a new deal approved by MPs by Saturday if he is to avoid asking for a delay. The UK is due to leave the EU at 23:00 GMT on 31 October and Boris Johnson says that deadline must be honoured. He is trying to hold together a coalition of Conservative Brexiteers and Democratic Unionists in support of his proposed alternative to the Irish backstop - the arrangement designed to keep an open border in Ireland. This video can not be played ""We need to deal with the facts,"" say the Irish deputy PM The DUP leader, Arlene Foster, had more than an hour of talks in Downing Street on Monday night and met the PM again on Tuesday evening for a further 90 minutes. Following that meeting, the DUP released a statement saying it would not give ""a detailed commentary"" but added ""it would be fair to indicate gaps remain and further work is required"". Earlier, Mrs Foster had told the BBC her party would ""stick with our principles"" that Northern Ireland ""must remain"" within the UK's customs union. She dismissed as ""speculation"" claims the new Brexit deal included a possible customs border in the Irish Sea - meaning Northern Ireland would be treated differently from the rest of the UK - saying the DUP could never accept that. Giving the Northern Ireland Assembly a regular vote on post-Brexit customs arrangements - which is reported to have been ditched in response to Ireland's objections - was also important to the DUP, Mrs Foster said. She said it was ""right to give space and time"" to negotiators to try to get a deal, but ""everyone knows our position"". Earlier on Tuesday, members of the pro-Brexit European Research Group attended a meeting at No 10, with chairman Steve Baker saying afterwards he was ""optimistic"" that ""a tolerable deal"" could be reached. BBC Brussels reporter Adam Fleming said the widely-held view there was that the UK was unlikely to be leaving on 31 October, and the question was whether an extension could be short in order to iron out some small issues, or had to be much longer to deal with bigger problems. After updating EU ministers on Tuesday morning, Mr Barnier signalled that he expected the UK to share the legal text of any proposed changes to the withdrawal agreement within hours. He said there was a ""narrow path"" to be trod between the EU's objective of protecting the single market and Mr Johnson's goal of keeping Northern Ireland in the UK's customs territory. While there had been progress, Mr Barnier said there was still a big disagreement about the inclusion of so-called ""level playing field"" provisionsin the political declarationsketching out the two sides' future trade relationship. These provisions would limit the UK's ability to diverge from the EU across a whole range of areas, including competition policy, employment rights, environmental standards and state aid. The UK says loosening these conditions is vital if it is to have an independent trade policy, but the EU says the UK cannot have privileged access to the single market market without following its rules as this would give it an unfair advantage. Asked whether it recognised talk of an EU deadline later on Tuesday, No 10 said Mr Johnson was ""aware of the time restraints"" and the UK was working hard to secure a deal ""as soon as possible"". This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics Regardless of what happens in Brussels, a showdown is anticipated in an emergency sitting of Parliament on Saturday - the first in 37 years, if it goes ahead. MPs will be able to back or reject any deal presented to them and there will be discussions on what to do next. Labour has threatened court action to force the PM to obey the Benn Act, amid speculation the PM could seek to sidestep it somehow. Speaking in Parliament, Leader of the House Jacob Rees-Mogg did not confirm whether the Saturday sitting would definitely go ahead, adding that it would depend on events in Brussels.

"Syria's Kurds said they would defend their territory at all costs A deal between Turkey and Russia has brought an end to a Turkish military operation in north-eastern Syria against a Kurdish-led militia alliance previously allied to the United States. We've boiled down why it matters. Turkey considers the biggest militia in the Kurdish-led alliance a terrorist organisation. It says it is an extension of a Kurdish rebel group fighting in Turkey. On 9 October, Turkish troops and allied Syrian rebels launched an offensive to create a 30km (20-mile) deep ""safe zone"" along the Syrian side of the border. Turkey's president says its aim is to ""destroy the terror corridor formed on our southern border"" It came after the withdrawal of US troops, who had relied on the Kurds to defeat the Islamic State group. The Kurds asked Syria's government and its ally, Russia, to help stop the assault. Turkey and Russia subsequently agreed to take joint control of the border area. Turkey wants to push back from its border members of a Syrian Kurdish militia called the People's Protection Units (YPG). Turkish leaders view the YPG as a terrorist organisation. They say it is an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has fought for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey for decades. The Syrian Democratic Forces alliance led the fight against the Islamic State group in Syria The YPG dominates an alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias called the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which drove IS out of a quarter of Syria with the help of a US-led multinational coalition. When the US declared the defeat of IS in March, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan pushed it to create a ""safe zone"" clear of YPG fighters in north-eastern Syria where refugees could be resettled. The US agreed to establish one together with Turkey in August and the YPG complied. But two months later, US troops pulled back from the border after Mr Erdogan decided to launch an operation to create a 440km-long ""safe zone"" unilaterally. The SDF said it had been ""stabbed in the back"" by the US and warned the defeat of IS might be reversed. On 9 October, Turkish troops and allied Syrian rebels attacked. Four days later, the SDF turned to the Syrian government and its backer, Russia, for help. They agreed to deploy Syrian soldiers to stop the advance. Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Russia's Vladimir Putin agreed a deal to end the offensive The US negotiated a 5-day ceasefire on 17 October to allow YPG fighters to withdraw from a 120km-long stretch of the frontier from Ras al-Ain to Tal Abyad where the fighting was focused. Just before the ceasefire expired, Mr Erdogan reached a deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin. They agreed Turkey could keep its forces in the area between Ras al-Ain and Tal Abyad, and that Russian and Syrian troops would take control of the rest of the border. It feels threatened by the People's Protection Units (YPG), the military wing of the Kurdish Democratic Union Party (PYD). The Turkish government insists the YPG is an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has fought for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey since 1984 and is designated as a terrorist group by the US and EU. The YPG and PKK share a similar ideology, but say they are separate entities. This is Turkey's third cross-border military operation against Syrian Kurdish-led forces The YPG is the dominant force in an alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias called the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). With the help of air strikes by a US-led multinational coalition against the jihadist group Islamic State (IS), SDF fighters captured tens of thousands of square kilometres of territory in north-eastern Syria between 2015 and 2019. The SDF set up an autonomous administration to govern the region, home to three million people. It avoided conflict with the Syrian government, but sought recognition for Kurdish autonomy. Despite being a member of Nato and the US-led coalition against IS, Turkey opposed the support the US gave the SDF. This video can not be played A young face destroyed by war: The impact of an air strike one year on In 2016, the Turkish military supported an offensive by allied Syrian rebel factions that drove IS militants out of the border area around Jarablus and stopped SDF fighters moving west, towards the Kurdish enclave of Afrin. In January 2018, after US officials said they were helping the SDF build a new ""border security force"" to prevent IS infiltration, Turkish-led forces launched an operation to expel YPG fighters from Afrin. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has long sought what he has called a ""safe zone"" clear of YPG fighters in north-east Syria. But the issue came to the fore after the SDF captured the last pocket of IS territory in Syria in March 2019. In August, the US and Turkey agreed to a ""security mechanism"" covering a predominantly Arab border area between Ras al-Ain and Tal Abyad. Turkish and US troops took part in joint patrols before the offensive US and Turkish troops carried out joint patrols and YPG began dismantling fortifications. But on 6 October, Mr Erdogan told US President Donald Trump that Turkey was about to start a unilateral operation to set up a ""safe zone"". Mr Trump ordered US troops to pull back from the area. At the start of ""Operation Peace Spring"" on 9 October, Mr Erdogan said Turkish troops and allied Syrian rebels aimed to ""neutralize terror threats against Turkey and lead to the establishment of a safe zone, facilitating the return of Syrian refugees to their homes"". SDF commanders warned that a Turkish offensive would ""spill the blood of thousands of innocent civilians"" and might pave the way for the return of IS. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, said 120 civilians were killed, along with 275 SDF fighters, 196 Turkish-backed Syrian rebels, 10 Turkish soldiers, and five Syrian soldiers. Dozens of civilians and combatants were killed in the first week of the assault President Erdogan said 775 ""terrorists"" had been ""neutralised"" and that 79 Syrian rebels and seven Turkish soldiers had been killed. He denied any civilians had been killed in Syria but said 20 had died in YPG attacks on Turkey. The UN said at least 176,000 people had been displaced by the fighting and that critical civilian infrastructure had been damaged. After four days of fighting, the US began a full withdrawal from northern Syria and the Kurds agreed a deal with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government for the Syrian army to deploy along the northern border for the first time in years to confront the Turkish-led forces. Russia, Mr Assad's staunch ally, sent military police to key locations. On 17 October, the US persuaded Mr Erdogan to ""pause"" Turkey's offensive to allow it to ""facilitate the withdrawal of YPG forces from the Turkish-controlled safe zone"". The ceasefire largely held and on 22 October the head of the SDF said the withdrawal had been completed. Residents of the town of Tal Tamer welcomed the arrival of the Syrian army That same day, Mr Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a plan to end the offensive. They agreed: Turkish forces would be allowed to remain in the 120km-long strip of territory they had captured between Ras al-Ain and Tal Abyad Russian and Syrian troops would take control of the rest of the border area and ensure YPG fighters pulled back 30km from the border Turkish and Russian troops would start joint patrols inside a 10km-deep zone along the border on 29 October There are questions about the deal, such as how long the Turkish forces can stay and what will happen to the tens of thousands of people being detained by the SDF on suspicion of links to IS. But there is no doubt it has cemented Russia's role as the pivotal player in Syria.

His deputy, TÃ¡naiste Simon Coveney, said earlier that ""big steps"" were needed on Tuesday ""to build on progress that has been slow"" because there would be no haggling over the details of the text once the summit began. The two-day EU summit is crucial because, under legislation passed last month - the Benn Act - the PM must get a new deal approved by MPs by Saturday if he is to avoid asking for a delay. The UK is due to leave the EU at 23:00 GMT on 31 October and Boris Johnson says that deadline must be honoured. He is trying to hold together a coalition of Conservative Brexiteers and Democratic Unionists in support of his proposed alternative to the Irish backstop - the arrangement designed to keep an open border in Ireland. This video can not be played ""We need to deal with the facts,"" say the Irish deputy PM The DUP leader, Arlene Foster, had more than an hour of talks in Downing Street on Monday night and met the PM again on Tuesday evening for a further 90 minutes. Following that meeting, the DUP released a statement saying it would not give ""a detailed commentary"" but added ""it would be fair to indicate gaps remain and further work is required"". Earlier, Mrs Foster had told the BBC her party would ""stick with our principles"" that Northern Ireland ""must remain"" within the UK's customs union. She dismissed as ""speculation"" claims the new Brexit deal included a possible customs border in the Irish Sea - meaning Northern Ireland would be treated differently from the rest of the UK - saying the DUP could never accept that. Giving the Northern Ireland Assembly a regular vote on post-Brexit customs arrangements - which is reported to have been ditched in response to Ireland's objections - was also important to the DUP, Mrs Foster said. She said it was ""right to give space and time"" to negotiators to try to get a deal, but ""everyone knows our position"". Earlier on Tuesday, members of the pro-Brexit European Research Group attended a meeting at No 10, with chairman Steve Baker saying afterwards he was ""optimistic"" that ""a tolerable deal"" could be reached. BBC Brussels reporter Adam Fleming said the widely-held view there was that the UK was unlikely to be leaving on 31 October, and the question was whether an extension could be short in order to iron out some small issues, or had to be much longer to deal with bigger problems. After updating EU ministers on Tuesday morning, Mr Barnier signalled that he expected the UK to share the legal text of any proposed changes to the withdrawal agreement within hours. He said there was a ""narrow path"" to be trod between the EU's objective of protecting the single market and Mr Johnson's goal of keeping Northern Ireland in the UK's customs territory. While there had been progress, Mr Barnier said there was still a big disagreement about the inclusion of so-called ""level playing field"" provisionsin the political declarationsketching out the two sides' future trade relationship. These provisions would limit the UK's ability to diverge from the EU across a whole range of areas, including competition policy, employment rights, environmental standards and state aid. The UK says loosening these conditions is vital if it is to have an independent trade policy, but the EU says the UK cannot have privileged access to the single market market without following its rules as this would give it an unfair advantage. Asked whether it recognised talk of an EU deadline later on Tuesday, No 10 said Mr Johnson was ""aware of the time restraints"" and the UK was working hard to secure a deal ""as soon as possible"". This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics Regardless of what happens in Brussels, a showdown is anticipated in an emergency sitting of Parliament on Saturday - the first in 37 years, if it goes ahead. MPs will be able to back or reject any deal presented to them and there will be discussions on what to do next. Labour has threatened court action to force the PM to obey the Benn Act, amid speculation the PM could seek to sidestep it somehow. Speaking in Parliament, Leader of the House Jacob Rees-Mogg did not confirm whether the Saturday sitting would definitely go ahead, adding that it would depend on events in Brussels.

"By the age of seven, children are already facing limits on their future aspirations in work, according to a report from the OECD international economics think tank. Andreas Schleicher, the OECD's director of education and skills, says ""talent is being wasted"" because of ingrained stereotyping about social background, gender and race. He is backing a project from the Education and Employers careers charity to give children a wider understanding of the range of jobs available. Mr Schleicher says children have begun making assumptions about what type of people will enter different types of work while they are still in primary school. There are only ""minimal changes"" in attitudes towards career options between the ages of seven and 17, says the report produced jointly by the OECD and Education and Employers. The report says that expectations about jobs are already in place by primary school The report, warning of the barriers to social mobility, says too often young people consider only the jobs that are already familiar to them, from friends and family. ""You can't be what you can't see. We're not saying seven-year-olds have to choose their careers now but we must fight to keep their horizons open,"" says Mr Schleicher. How do career dreams really work out? Lessons about the jobs market push up GCSE grades Children in poorer countries have higher career ambitions Self-promoters do nothing but still get ahead at work He is backing the Education and Employers' efforts to bring people from the world of work into schools, with the aim of widening access to the jobs market and raising aspirations. ""It's a question of social justice and common sense to tackle ingrained assumptions as early as possible or they will be very tough to unpick later on,"" says Mr Schleicher. The OECD education chief will speak at an Education and Employers event in London on Tuesday, where the charity will announce plans to double to 100,000 the network of people who go into schools and talk about their jobs and career paths. At present there are more than 50,000 volunteers, representing jobs from ""app designers to zoologists"". Young people need to hear about a wider range of jobs and employers, says the study The intention is to create ""light-bulb moments"" where young people can see a possible new direction and hear from role models. Research for the careers report shows that young people often have very narrow ideas about potential job options. The most common influences are the occupations of people in their family, the jobs they see in the media and the type of work they see as most likely for people of their gender and background. The findings show that in primary school, boys from wealthier homes are more likely to expect to become lawyers or managers while girls from deprived backgrounds are expecting to go into hairdressing or shop work. Career ambitions can often reflect the influence of family background rather than ability Boys from deprived backgrounds were particularly likely to want to go into careers such as sport or entertainment. Mr Schleicher warns of a mismatch between the limited range of aspirations and the changing demands of the jobs market. ""Too often young people's ambitions are narrowed by an innate sense of what people from their background should aspire to and what's out of reach,"" says Nick Chambers, chief executive of Education and Employers. ""The importance of exposure to the world of work at primary age cannot be overstated,"" says Paul Whiteman, leader of the National Association of Head Teachers.

"The UK will not meet its climate change targets without a revolution in home heating, a think tank says. A report from the cross-party Policy Connect says gas central heating boilers also threaten the UKâs clean air goals. But a poll conducted among MPs suggests that most do not consider pollution from home heating to be a priority. That is despite the fact 14% of UK greenhouse gases come from our homes, a similar level to emissions from cars. In major cities gas boilers are also a main source of nitrogen dioxide emissions. The government wants low-carbon heat systems to be standard for all new homes built after 2025. But that will still leave the vast majority of existing homes in the UK with polluting heat systems. Big lifestyle changes 'needed to cut emissions' Ditch cars to meet climate targets, say MPs A spokesman for the Treasury said a plan to support the move to sustainable heating systems would go out to consultation later this year. The task is huge. Policy Connect says more than 20,000 homes a week must switch to low-carbon heating between 2025 and 2050 to meet UK climate goals. The think tank says many innovations need to be pursued. They include smart systems and controls; more use of the ""internet of things""; hydrogen boilers; biogas; electric heat and direct infrared heat among others. Policy Connect said future heating systems might also need to supply home cooling as UK temperatures rise along with climate change. It recommends that the government creates an Olympic-style body to take on the challenge. The reportâs lead author, Joanna Furtado, said: âThe next five years are critical for heat decarbonisation in new and existing homes and for meeting our climate targets. âWe need to spark a national conversation on heat as MPs and consumers are still in the dark on the savings greener home heat solutions could offer."" Some argue the focus should be on improving insulation in existing homes She said investment was also needed in re-training and re-skilling the nationâs heating engineers and installers for the low carbon transition. The document highlights yet another challenge for a government that is already veering away from its medium-term climate goals under the Climate Change Act. And there's a chicken and egg problem. Ministers have not yet produced policies to insulate Britain's homes - even though well-insulated homes are essential for some low-carbon heat systems. A report from the advisory Committee on Climate Change said it would cost Â£4,800 to install low-carbon heating in a new home, and Â£26,300 in an existing house. Steve Turner from the Home Builders Federation says they accept the targets, but wonders if they've got their priorities right. He told BBC News: ""There are significantly greater emissions savings to be made from existing housing on the basis that they are considerably less efficient than new builds. ""Big energy saving could be made in inefficient older homes as opposed to the incremental gains from new builds that are already required to be built to low-carbon standards. ""The cost for retrofitting existing homes would need to be met by owners or government, as opposed to requiring builders to incorporate it into their costs on new homes."" A government spokesperson said: ""This report rightly highlights heat as one of the UK's biggest challenges in decarbonisation. ""Heat accounts for more than a third of our current carbon emissions, which is why we're spending Â£2.8bn to encourage low-carbon heating in both homes and businesses as well as investing in innovation. ""Getting the right mix of technologies to increase energy efficiency is vital. We will also require changes in consumer behaviour as we work towards net zero by 2050.""

"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: ""My call is that the referendum must happen next year"" A second referendum on Scottish independence ""must happen next year"", Nicola Sturgeon has told the SNP conference. Ms Sturgeon confirmed that she will ask the UK government for formal consent by the end of this year. She said Westminster had ""no right"" to block the request, and its opposition to indyref2 is ""not sustainable"". But she stressed any referendum had to be legal if the result was to be recognised internationally. She said this was because her aim was not merely to deliver a referendum - but to deliver independence. Could social care charges be abolished? Brian Taylor: 'A faintly surreal SNP conference' SNP conference: Three questions facing the party SNP 'winning independence economic argument' Ms Sturgeon, who is Scotland's first minister, told delegates at the conference in Aberdeen: ""My call is that the referendum must happen next year. ""And we are getting ready. By the new year, we will have completed our legislative preparations. We are already working to update the independence prospectus. ""And I can confirm today that before the end of this year, I will demand the transfer of power that puts the legality of a referendum beyond any doubt."" The UK government has repeatedly said it will not grant a Section 30 order, which was used to ensure the legality of the independence referendum in 2014 in which Scottish voters opted to remain in the UK by 55% to 45%. Delegates overwhelmingly rejected an attempt to have Plan B debated when the SNP conference opened on Sunday This has led to calls for Ms Sturgeon to outline a so-called Plan B, with some activists and elected politicians arguing that the SNP winning a majority of Scottish seats in an election would be enough for independence negotiations to begin with the UK government. Others have called for an unofficial referendum to be held, similar to the disputed one in Catalonia in 2017 - while the Scottish government's Brexit secretary, Mike Russell, has not ruled out the possibility of a legal challenge to the UK's government's position. SNP election win 'could be independence mandate' But Ms Sturgeon told the conference that the question should not be what the SNP will do if Westminster refuses to agree to a Section 30. She said: ""The question should be demanded of the Westminster parties - what gives you any right to deny people in Scotland our ability to choose our own future? ""The Westminster refusal is not sustainable. We can already see the cracks appearing. ""Just like us, they know there is going to be a referendum. And they know that when there is, Scotland will choose independence."" However, she again stressed that the process ""must be legal"" and must ""allow majority support to be expressed clearly and unambiguously"". She added: ""It must have the recognition of the international community. Why? Because our job is not just to deliver a referendum. Our job is to deliver independence."" Large pro-independence marches have been held across Scotland in recent months Analysis by polling expert Prof Sir John Curtice It is very clear that the SNP now want an early independence referendum, and they are clearly buoyed up by polls that show something of an increase of support for independence - not least among those who voted Remain. But let's just bear in mind the polls are at best saying 50% support for independence. We're still a very long way from the position that we were told not so long ago that the SNP would want to see opinion polls consistently, over a considerable period of time, saying 60% support before they would take the prospect of another referendum. Holding an early referendum is potentially a very risky project. In particular, I think there's a crucial question that the circumstance under which a second referendum might actually happen are ones that are perhaps rather different from the current political circumstances. If we accept - as Nicola Sturgeon implied - that a referendum is only to happen if we get a hung parliament, well, the hung parliament implies that Boris Johnson no longer prime minister so that reason for independence disappears. But also it probably implies that we may have had another referendum on EU membership which might have come up with a different result and therefore Brexit is no longer a potential rallying call for independence. Any Westminster party that wants SNP support if there is a hung Parliament after a general election should not pick up the phone if they ""don't respect Scotland's right to choose our own future at a time of our own choosing"". The Conservatives, Labour and Liberal Democrats should apologise for the ""broken promises"" they made ahead of the 2014 independence referendum. Brexit will ""continue to dominate Westminster for years to come"" regardless of whether the UK leaves the EU with or without a deal. SNP MPs will never vote for any Brexit deal that takes Scotland ""out of the EU, out of the single market and out of the customs union."" Ms Sturgeon said the Scottish government would introduce a new law to establish emergency protective orders which would help to ensure that it is the perpetrators of domestic violence rather than the victims who lose their homes. She said: ""We need to change the reality that for women and their children, often the only way to escape an abuser is to flee their home. For too many, that results in the victims of abuse becoming homeless."" Ms Sturgeon also announced that the SNP will scrap non-residential social care charges for all if she is still first minister after the Holyrood election in 2021. And she said her party would pledge to expand childcare into the school holidays for primary pupils from the poorest backgrounds in its election manifesto. Scottish Conservative leader Jackson Carlaw said the answer from Downing Street to Ms Sturgeon's request for a Section 30 order should be an ""unequivocal no"". And he claimed Ms Sturgeon ""simply wanted to get through what was a potentially hostile conference with a series of vacuous promises which will never be kept, and throw some red meat to the hardliners"". Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said Ms Sturgeon plan would mean ""more division and uncertainty"" and could result in a hard border between Scotland and England. And Willie Rennie, the leader of the Scottish Liberal Deomcrats, said independence would be ""bad for Scotland just like Brexit because breaking up long-term economic partnerships is very hard to do"".

Bridgend Animal Rescue Centre (Barc) in North Cornelly expects to see a 25% increase this year with owners unable to afford to keep their animals. The centre has also seen a sharp rise in demand for their pet food bank. Last year, 117 animals were rescued by the centre but in 2018-2019 that figure was reached by 1 September. Rescue puppy Dilyn arrives at Downing Street Cash crisis rescue dogs face death Animal cruelty cases reach five-year high Rebecca Lloyd, managing director of Barc, said: ""We've got animals at the centre at the moment because their owners can't afford medical treatment for them. So we've had to take them in. ""Just last night we had a call from a member of the community whose cat was very unwell during giving birth and the owner couldn't afford medical treatment so we took the cat to the vet because she was close to death. ""That ended up costing Â£600 but the owner couldn't afford that or even vet's medical insurance to cover herself. ""But it's not just medical treatment, it's also supplies such as food, baskets and blankets and we have those here too at our food bank."" Welfare officer Paula Evans with a rabbit called Willow whose teeth were overgrown The centre is one of a small number of organisations in Wales to provide the service. Mrs Lloyd said some pet owners cannot even afford to feed themselves, let alone their animals. ""People who access regular food banks can be referred to us and we can deliver to that food bank, but we also take self-referrals for short-term issues, if someone has lost their job or has fallen ill unexpectedly,"" she added. ""The economy in this area is far from great. There's a lot of unemployment, there's a lot of young people out of work here and we provide courses for them too in our training centre. ""There is a big need for this animal rescue centre."" The RSPCA said it had received 1,371 reports of abandoned or dumped animals across Wales so far this year. ""We will never truly know why people abandon animals - as every circumstance is different, and the reasons are likely to be plentiful,"" a spokesman said. ""Sadly, when owners are unable to cope, whether that be with an animal's behaviour, the costs of keeping the pet or other things in their life take over, they sometimes opt to abandon them. ""Owning an animal can be so rewarding - but the number of abandonments shows that for some, the commitment can be overbearing.""

"Georgia, Sydney and Kassy all began using e-cigarettes aged 16 Almost 40% of sellers targeted by councils in England have been caught illegally allowing children to buy e-cigarette products, a report has found. Ninety of the 227 premises tested sold vaping goods to under-age teenagers in 2018-19, data from 34 councils showed. Trading Standards - which compiled the research - has called for greater resources to enforce the law. Public Health England said vaping was 95% healthier than smoking. It is estimated 3.6 million people in the UK now use e-cigarettes. Georgia 17, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme she had been to shops where she had been given free e-cigarette tutorials and liquids. She has been vaping for over a year and ""rarely"" been asked for ID. Asked for proof of age the first time she had tried to buy vaping products, she had been allowed to complete the purchase after telling the seller she had forgotten it, she said. The teenager now believes she has experienced negative health effects as a result of vaping. ""I went to hospital, they took my blood and they said there's too much liquid in my lungs,"" she said. ""They gave me some tablets for a course of two weeks. I'm still getting the pain today."" Vaping is seen as safer than smoking because lower levels of the harmful chemicals found in tobacco smoke are produced The Chartered Trading Standards Institute's 2018-19 Tobacco Control Survey shows the proportion of targeted sellers allowing children to buy vaping products has risen 12 percentage points in a year, from 28% to 40%. Forty-seven of the 90 illegal sales were recorded at specialist e-cigarette suppliers. Discount shops had the second most illegal sales, 11, while eight were reported at market and car-boot sales. The figures also suggest sellers are more than twice as likely to allow under-age purchases of e-cigarette products compared with traditional tobacco products, for which 18% of those tested were found to have acted illegally. E-cigarette products can also be purchased online and the Victoria Derbyshire programme has spoken to several parents whose children have bought products while under-age. One mother, whose 13-year-old son bought them on eBay, said it had been ""scarily easy"" for him to do so. She said she felt ""frustration and anger"" towards the retailer because there had not been any age-verification checks. ""We think probably there were terms and conditions he was signing up to when he opened his eBay account, but probably just a tick box, nothing more than that,"" she added. An eBay representative said its sellers ""are required to have an effective age-verification process to prevent the sale of e-cigarettes to minors"". ""Sellers who do not comply will be permanently suspended and we have banned those referenced by the BBC,"" the representative said. ""We have also launched an additional review of seller processes and practices to ensure businesses selling these products are carrying out the required age checks on buyers."" Chief executive Leon Livermore said Trading Standards needed ""appropriate funding and resources"" Leon Livermore, chief executive of the Chartered Trading Standards Institute, said it ""can only do so much"" with its current level of resources. ""I'd say to the government, 'If you want your policies delivered effectively, you need to provide appropriate funding and resources through to the front line,'"" he said. He said he was also in favour of banning flavoured products, which some say lead children who do not smoke into vaping. But this is something Public Health England (PHE) rejects. Its lead on tobacco control, Martin Dockrell, told the BBC there is ""no evidence that flavours are leading kids who don't smoke into vaping, but there is evidence that they are part of what helps smokers to switch"". PHE added: ""There is widespread academic and clinical consensus that while not without risk, vaping is far less harmful than smoking."" Sydney, 17, who began using e-cigarettes aged 16 despite not having previously smoked, told the Victoria Derbyshire programme it was the flavours she was ""mainly attracted to"" and she would ""probably"" stop were they taken away. She said she had begun to spot the signs of addiction. ""I can go days without it but then sometimes I will have that feeling of, 'Oh my God, I feel like I do need the nicotine and the vape,'"" she said. Both Georgia and Sydney also said they had been originally attracted to vaping because of images on social media. They explained it was becoming a ""trend"" led by celebrities. A recent study by King's College London, which looked at online surveys from more than 12,000 16- to 19-year-olds worldwide, found 38% of English respondents said vaping adverts made e-cigarettes seem appealing. This is despite regulations saying adverts can be targeted towards adult consumers only. The UK Vaping Industry Association (UKVIA) told the BBC: ""Products should never be marketed or sold to under-18s. ""We expect the highest standards from our members to show leadership to the rest of the industry. ""We also expect our members to make sure that products are not designed to appeal specifically to anyone under 18 years old,"" it added.

"Harry Styles said he still checks ""weak spots"" in his home after he said he received notes through his letterbox A homeless man who camped outside pop star Harry Styles' house for several months has been found guilty of stalking the singer. Mr Styles, 25, offered to buy Pablo Tarazaga-Orero, 26, food after he saw him sleeping rough outside his north west London home in March. Speaking at Hendon Magistrates' Court, the singer said he locks his bedroom door every night after being followed. Mr Styles said the man's behaviour was ""erratic and frightening"". The former One Direction singer said he was ""sad to see someone so young sleeping rough"" when he first saw Tarazaga-Orero. He bought him vegan sandwiches, salads and muffins, after the rough sleeper asked for some edamame beans. After trying to cut contact, the pop star saw him nearly every day, and received notes and money in his letterbox, District Judge Nigel Deane heard. When asked whether he had stalked the celebrity, Tarazaga-Orero said: ""That was never my intention. In the end I just wanted the money he offered me. ""I don't have any feelings for him. I'm not in love with him."" Tarazaga-Orero will be sentenced on 21 October.
