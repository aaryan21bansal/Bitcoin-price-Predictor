"Nicola Sturgeon said that, based on talks she had already had, she believes that if Scotland achieved independence, it could re-enter the EU relatively quickly The SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon was the first party leader interviewed in a series of prime-time BBC One interviews by Andrew Neil Boris Johnson spent the day in Wales, campaigning - and shearing sheep - at the Royal Welsh Winter Fair Labour promised to introduce annual property ""MOT"" for private tenants in England Jeremy Corbyn also insisted his Â£58bn pledge to compensate the Waspi women was ""a moral debt we owe"" Nicky Morgan insisted Tory pledges on social care do amount to ""a clear plan"" despite criticism Lib Dems talked defence and international aid - and attacked Boris Johnson's ties with Donald Trump Former Prime Minister Tony Blair accuses both Labour and the Conservatives of offering ""fantasies"" in their general election manifestos Joseph Lee and John Hand Set your alarm for tomorrow - there's plenty more election news heading our way. Here's some of the things to expect: What's happened today? We're wrapping things up for the night, so here's a quick look back at some of the main events today: The politician formerly known as Lord Buckethead is pictured second from the right in this election count line-up Before we round up the serious headlines of the day, here's one manifesto launch you might have missed. Count Binface previously drew international attention when he stood as Lord Buckethead against Theresa May in 2017, but he has since beenforced into a rebrand because of a copyright dispute,external. Now, standing for election under his new name, he's unveiled his30-point plan for the nation,external, including policies such as making Craig Charles the official BBC commentator for all state occasions and closing down shops that play Christmas music before December. His policy on Brexit is that there should be a referendum, but only to allow voters to decide whether they want another referendum. Allow Twitter content?

As the Labour Party mentioned in its response to the Chief Rabbi, it is launching a manifesto on race and faith issues tomorrow. We have already been told that the party will set out policies on combatting anti-Semitism and it will also detail how children should be taught in schools about what the British Empire did to the rest of the world back in the days when Britain was truly a colonial superpower. The plans include creating an ""emancipation educational trust"" to ensure ""historical injustice, colonialism and role of the British empire is taught in the national curriculum"". It also says it wants new measures to tackle racial pay gaps and a race equality unit within the Treasury to examine the impact of policies on BAME communities. Read the full story Martin BashirBBC News This is a sweeping and unequivocal condemnation of Labour's leadership, its treatment of Jewish parliamentarians and its handling of allegations of anti-Semitism. It's also highly unusual for such an intervention by the leader of a religious denomination during a general election campaign. The Chief Rabbi has pastoral oversight of half the population of those who identify as Jewish in the United Kingdom. Last week. the Archbishops of Canterbury and York appealed to voters and politicians to ""honour the truth"" and ""challenge falsehoods"" but there was no specific criticism of individual candidates nor their party leaders. But the Chief Rabbi's article, to be published in the Times newspaper on Tuesday, asks if Jeremy Corbyn is fit for high office and calls on voters to consider what the result of this election ""will say about the moral compass of this country?"" Last year, three Jewish newspapers - The Jewish Chronicle, The Jewish News and The Jewish Telegraph - published exactly the same front cover on 25th July 2018 - arguing that a Labour government under the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn would prove ""an existential threat"" to British Jewry. The Chief Rabbi, in this highly critical column, is saying much the same. ""Jeremy Corbyn is a lifelong campaigner against anti-Semitism and has made absolutely clear it has no place in our party and society and that no-one who engages in it does so in his name,"" a Labour spokesman says. ""A Labour government will guarantee the security of the Jewish community, defend and support the Jewish way of life, and combat rising anti-Semitism in our country and across Europe. Our race and faith manifesto [which will be launched tomorrow], sets out our policies to achieve this."" The Chief Rabbi says it is a ""mendacious fiction"" that Labour has investigated all outstanding cases of anti-Semitism, claiming that at least 130 cases before the party are outstanding and ""thousands"" were reported but remain unresolved. But Labour says: ""The 130 figure is inaccurate and it is categorically untrue to suggest there are thousands of outstanding cases. We are taking robust action to root out anti-Semitism in the party, with swift suspensions, processes for rapid expulsions and an education programme for members."" Morte on that opinion piece from the Chief Rabbi. Ephraim Mirvis,writing in the Times,external, says that the ""Jewish community has watched with incredulity as supporters of the Labour leadership have hounded parliamentarians, members and even staff out of the party for challenging anti-Jewish racism"". He says: ""The way in which the leadership has dealt with anti-Jewish racism is incompatible with the British values of which we are so proud - of dignity and respect for all people. It has left many decent Labour members both Jewish and non-Jewish, ashamed of what has transpired."" He says it is not his place to tell people how to vote but asks what the election will say about the UK's ""moral compass"". ""When December 12 arrives, I ask every person to vote with their conscience. Be in no doubt, the very soul of our nation is at stake,"" he says. The Chief Rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, criticises the Labour Party, writing in the Times that it is not doing enough to root out anti-Semitism. He asks people to vote with their conscience in the forthcoming general election. ""Prime Ditherer"" - used as an insult towards Jeremy Corbyn and his neutral stance on Brexit - has been the Tories' attack slogan of the day. It was unveiled on a Conservative election poster (with a picture of Jeremy Corbyn) by Culture Secretary Nicky Morgan this morning. Health Secretary Matt Hancock later used the words in an interview, saying: ""So Jeremy Corbyn is the prime ditherer as demonstrated by his position, his various positions on Brexit, and his lack of a position now."" And then Boris Johnson later said of Mr Corbyn: ""He doesn't want to be prime minister, he wants to be prime ditherer. He used to be indecisive, now he's not so sure."" Nicky Morgan claimed it was Conservative Central HQ who came up with the phrase. But look at this tweet from 2016,  and the accompanying Sunday Mirror column, and it does seem that Labour's John Prescott was the one who coined the phrase - about then-PM Theresa May.

If you missed that 30-minute Andrew Neil interview of the SNP's Nicola Sturgeon and want a quick upsum, here it is:  A full report can be read here. Much of the reaction online following the interview of SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon is praise for the ""forensic"" questioning, which they said put the Scottish First Minister under pressure. Some viewers thought that Andrew Neil ""out-questioned and out-answered"" his interviewee, but a Sturgeon supporter says she was honest, articulate and had a firm command of the facts. Several posters on social media speculate how other party leaders will fare under a similar grilling. You can find out how Jeremy Corbyn gets on tomorrow at 7pm on BBC One. Allow Twitter content?

That's all from Nicola Sturgeon speaking to Andrew Neil.You can watch the full interview here. Finally, Ms Sturgeon - a former health minister - is challenged on the performance of Scotland's NHS under the SNP. Mr Neil says Scotland is failing to meet its target for the number of patients treated within 12 weeks, at only 72%. ""Itâs not good enough,"" Ms Sturgeon says. But she says they are taking steps to address it with an Â£850m plan. Mr Neil brings up ""children dying in a Glasgow hospital because the water is contaminated"", Scotland's drug problem and a new Edinburgh hospital which has not opened after nine years. Ms Sturgeon says she is increasing investment in drug services and there are inquiries into the other issues. ""Yes, we have challenges in Scotland but we are dealing with
these challenges more effectively than the rest of the UK,"" she says. Mr Neil quotes an assessment by the Institute for Fiscal Studies which says that independence would require another decade of ""restraint on public spending"", saying that austerity would continue. But Ms Sturgeon says she doesn't accept that assessment. She says if the growth commission's recommendations had been followed over the last ten years, Scotland would have escaped austerity. The SNP has warned that trade friction caused by Brexit
could mean 80,000 jobs lost in Scotland. Mr Neil asks, why wonât trade friction
with the rest of the UK harm the economy after independence? The SNP leader says we âdonât yet know the final
relationship with EUâ and adds that itâs not independence that causes the trade friction, ""itâs Brexit"". She says it's in Scotland's interests to remain in the EU, a much larger market, and draws a comparison with Ireland's success in increasing exports. Challenged on how quickly Scotland could rejoin the EU if Brexit
goes ahead and the country votes for independence, Ms Sturgeon says she is ânot
going to give a specific timescaleâ but it âcould be relatively quickâ. But Mr Neil says Scotlandâs Growth Commission says it could be
five or ten years, as the country would need to establish its own currency. Ms Sturgeon says she is âabsolutely certainâ that an independent
currency would not be a requirement. âWe would have a discussion with the EU
about the journey"" Scotland was on in terms of an independent currency, she
says. Mr Neil says Scotland would also be required to build
substantial reserves in its new currency and asks how it can do that with the
largest deficit in Europe. Ms Sturgeon says Scotland is reducing its deficit faster than
expected. âOur task is to get our deficit reducing faster. That is principally
through growing our economy faster, which remaining in the EU or returning to the
EU helps us to do,â she says. This video can not be played General election 2019: Independent Scotland joining EU? Mr Neil turns his questions to the practicalities of
securing a Scottish independence referendum and establishing Scotland as a
separate state. Ms Sturgeon previously said Brexit was a âmaterial changeâ that
justified asking the Scottish people about independence again. But Mr Neil
asks, if she blocks Brexit, doesnât that justification disappear? Ms Sturgeon says: âThe material change is the way in which
Scotland has had it completely demonstrated to it over the last three years
that our views and our voice doesnât matter.â She adds that âour future path as a country is not in our
hands, itâs in the hands of Westminster politicians like Boris Johnson with his
strings being pulled by Nigel Farageâ. The other requirement for another referendum was for âclear
and sustainedâ support for independence in opinion polls, says Mr Neil. He says
that hasnât been met either. âAlmost all opinion polls show increasing support for
independence. They show increasing support for a second referendum,â she says. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,0.21140806
"This video can not be played During a demo for the new Tesla 'Cybertruck', Elon Musk had an embarrassing moment Elon Musk has revealed why the windows of Tesla's Cybertruck broke during an embarrassing launch incident. He blamed the mishap on the order in which a demonstration had taken place. The vehicle was first struck with a sledgehammer in what appeared to be a successful demonstration of its armour body's strength. But this had caused an unseen crack, Mr Musk revealed,which had subsequently led to the windows smashingwhen they had been hit with a steel ball. The futuristic vehicle was unveiled on Thursday in Hawthorne, California, where its stainless steel, angular design drew a mixed response from the audience. Responding to a fan on Twitter, Mr Musk said the incident could have been easily avoided. The Cybertruck launch that didn't go quite as expected Tesla shares surge after unexpected profit ""Sledgehammer impact on door cracked the base of the glass, which is why the steel ball didn't bounce off,"" he wrote. ""Should have done steel ball on window, then sledgehammer the door. Next time."" Over the weekend, Mr Musk tweeted footage of an earlier demonstration, carried out behind the scenes moments before the launch, showing the windows withstanding the impact of the steel ball.

Despite the awkward mishap, Tesla announced it had received more than 200,000 ""orders"" for its Cybertruck following the demonstration. The firm is charging $100 to reserve the vehicle, but the sum is refundable if the customer later changes their mind. The success of the launch event has caused some speculation on social media the incident, viewed millions of times online, had been orchestrated to go viral. ""It's hard to say if that one infamous moment is why Tesla has been able to get 200,000 deposits on the Cybertruck but all the extra attention certainly didn't hurt,"" said Jessica Caldwell, from vehicle marketplace Edmunds. ""Moments like that are why Tesla has such a passionate fan base: while most executives are always hyper-rehearsed and polished, Elon Musk has never been afraid to show his human side, for better or worse. ""Tesla's fans are notorious for giving the company the benefit of the doubt and assume the technology will be sorted out by the time the truck actually goes on sale.""

Five teenagers, including a 13-year-old girl, were arrested in connection with the disturbance, which involved up to 100 young people in a public area of the multiplex, on Saturday night. In a statement, Vue said the film opened in 60 of its sites across the UK and Ireland on Friday. ""But during the first 24 hours of the film over 25 significant incidents were reported and escalated to senior management in 16 separate cinemas,"" it said. ""This is the biggest number we have ever seen for any film in a such a short time frame."" This video can not be played Several arrests were made at a multiplex in Birmingham on Saturday (Courtesy Rachael Allison) A spokeswoman for Vue confirmed police had been called to some of the incidents, but could not confirm exactly how many times. The chain has stressed the decision to pull the film was prompted only because of the risk of further violence. A spokeswoman for Vue said a ""significant incident"" was ""any incident that has a risk to audience members"", adding that they were awaiting clarification of the details of individual cases. The Odeon chain says it is not withdrawing the film, but ""a number of security measures are in place"" for Blue Story screenings, though it refused to elaborate on what they are. In Birmingham, a note on the door of the Odeon cinema at the Broadway Plaza said staff would be carrying out bag searches throughout the day.

In an Instagram post on Sunday, the rapper-turned-filmmaker wrote: ""Sending love to all those involved in yesterday's violence at Star City in Birmingham. ""It's truly unfortunate that a small group of people can ruin things for everybody. ""Blue Story is a film about love not violence."" On Monday, he tweeted: ""We lost nearly half of our screens on the third day but we still made history with Â£1.3m in 3 days. Blue Story is number three in the UK box office. Thank you.""

The film was released last Friday On Saturday, West Midlands Police officers drew Tasers and used a dispersal order to clear the Star City venue. Footage from inside the multiplex appeared to show fights and people on the floor screaming. The five teenagers - two girls aged 13 and 14 and three 14-year-old boys - have all now been bailed alongside a 19-year-old man. Four were held on suspicion of assaulting police and one of the boys was detained on suspicion of obstructing police. Another of the boys was arrested on suspicion of violent disorder after an image circulated on social media showing a number of youths, with one carrying a machete. Police were called to the complex, in Nechells, at about 17:30 GMT and cleared the area by 21:00. The officers hurt during the disorder suffered minor facial injuries.

"Matthew Stokes and his brother Adam were found dead at their home in Hinckley A woman says she was locked in a house, smothered and stabbed by her husband, who was found dead with their two sons. David Stokes, 43, and children Adam, 11, and Matthew, five, were discovered in their home on Welwyn Road, Hinckley, Leicestershire, on 2 November 2016. The boys were found dead under a quilt in the same bed and holding hands. An inquest heard that, hours before the bodies were discovered, Mr Stokes locked Sally Stokes in the house sparking a stand-off with police. Mrs Stokes told Rutland & North Leicestershire Coroner's Court she was stabbed before she managed to escape. Mr Stokes was later found dead from a single stab wound. A medical cause of death for both boys has been given as ""unascertained"" but a pathologist said it could have been a result of drowning or pressure to the neck. Dr Frances Hollingbury added that ""it is likely they were unconscious or already dead when they were positioned where they were found"". Latest news and stories from the East Midlands Mrs Stokes told the court she and Mr Stokes had been married since 2011 and separated three months before the deaths. In addition to problems in the marriage, Mrs Stokes said she discovered Mr Stokes had searched online for escorts and a date rape drug. She said she confronted him about this on 1 November, but the situation at the time was ""calm"" and she left just after 18:00 GMT. Sally Stokes, arriving at the inquest earlier, said David Stokes tried to smother her with a pillow Mrs Stokes told the court she returned at about 21:15 and, in the hours that followed, Mr Stokes locked her in the house, hit her on the back of the head with a rolling pin and tried to smother her with a pillow. She said she got to the back garden and screamed for help before Mr Stokes hit her head against a wall. The inquest was told police were called and there were regular phone calls between negotiators and Mr Stokes before he stabbed her and she ran out into the street. She said: ""I felt a bump in my back, felt the warmth of blood, then I realised he'd stabbed me. ""The look on his face was like satisfaction. I'll never forget it - as though he'd won."" Mrs Stokes was taken to hospital and told the following day about her sons and that Mr Stokes had killed himself. She was ruled out of the investigation as a suspect by police, the inquest heard. Finishing her evidence, Mrs Stokes said she felt police acted in the right way during the stand-off. ""If police had forced the situation, I wouldn't be here,"" she said. The inquest also heard Mr Stokes filmed a video of himself with the boys at about 19:00 on 1 November and that is the last time the boys are known to have been alive. The inquest continues.

"Tesco has temporarily withdrawn pots of its own-brand honey amid concerns that it contains adulterated ingredients. It comes after tests conducted by Richmond council in London indicated that ""Tesco Set Honey 454g"" contains syrups made from sugar. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) said it was ""[looking] into these reports"" to see if further action was necessary. The supermarket chain denied there were any problems with the product and insisted it was ""100% pure"". Concerns were raised over the honey, which costs Â£1.35 per jar, by Richmond council in south-west London, which conducted tests after it was alerted by a member of the public. ""The findings of the analysis is that there is likely to be adulteration with non-natural products,""a council spokeswoman told the Sunday Times.,external The council contacted the FSA, which confirmed it was looking into the matter, but has denied it called for Tesco to withdraw the product. ""We are continuing to look into these reports to determine whether further action is required,"" the FSA said in a statement. ""Honey is a natural but complex product and there are a number of different tests which may be used to determine authenticity."" Nevertheless, the retailer said it has temporarily taken the honey off the shelves for further examination, but insists the product is ""100% pure, natural and can be directly traced back to the beekeeper"". ""We carry out regular tests to ensure our honey meets this standard and is fully compliant with all legal requirements,"" Tesco said in a statement. ""However, as a precautionary measure, we have temporarily withdrawn the product to conduct further tests."" Chris Elliott, professor of food safety at Queen's University Belfast, who led a review of food systemsfollowing the 2013 horsemeat scandal, said it was a ""bold"" statement from Tesco. ""They are claiming they are 100% sure it is pure honey. If they are correct then the testing method is wrong. If it proves to be adulterated then Tesco doesn't have the control over their supply chain they claim,"" he said. The method used by Richmond council was nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), which he said was a relatively new technique that can be used to determine the sources of sugars. Tesco's decision to withdraw the product was a ""prudent"" step, Professor Elliott added. ""There's no food safety issue here but consumers must trust our retailers to take every precaution that they are not selling us adulterated food,"" he said.

"A helicopter and lifeboats searched for the missing aircraft The search for a missing light aircraft and its pilot off the Welsh coast has been suspended for the night, the coastguard said. North Wales Police said the plane had been flying from Caernarfon Airport to the Great Orme, Llandudno and back on Monday afternoon when it disappeared. The force added that there were no other passengers, and officers were supporting the missing pilot's family. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency said the search would resume on Tuesday. A coastguard helicopter and the RNLI searched an area around Puffin Island, near Penmon, Anglesey for the aircraft on Monday. A flight which travelled from Caernarfon towards Llandudno on Monday appeared to disappear from the radar HM Coastguard said it received a call for assistance shortly before 12:50 GMT. A spokesperson said the search was launched after a report that an aircraft had disappeared from radar contact. Lifeboats from Beaumaris, Moelfre and Llandudno, and North Wales Police all took part. North Wales Police said: ""We received a call at 12:59 reporting a possible crash involving a light aircraft in the Penmon area. ""Officers are currently assisting HM Coastguard and our enquiries are ongoing."" The Air Accidents Investigation Branch also said it had sent a team to investigate an accident involving a light aircraft near Beaumaris, Anglesey. The RNLI said two lifeboats were launched from Anglesey to assist in the search for an aircraft last seen two miles north east of Penmon.

"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon says the timescale for an independent Scotland joining the EU would be ârelatively quick"". An independent Scotland could rejoin the EU on a ""relatively quick"" timescale, Nicola Sturgeon has said. The Scottish first minister and SNP leader wants a new referendum on independence to be held in 2020, and is also opposed to the UK leaving the EU. She told the BBC that Scotland would be ""seeking a way back in"" to the EU if Brexit happened. The Conservatives have claimed that a Labour government backed by SNP votes would lead to two referendums in 2020. The SNP leader was taking part in a special interview with Andrew Neil as part of the build-up to the snap general election on 12 December. Other party leaders are also set to be quizzed by Mr Neil, with Labour's Jeremy Corbyn to follow on Tuesday. Nicola Sturgeon interview fact-checked Ms Sturgeon has said her SNP MPs could potentially help to put Mr Corbyn in Downing Street in the event of a hung parliament, but said the Labour leader must first accept the ""fundamental principle"" that an independence referendum should be ""in Scotland's hands"". She told Mr Neil that she would always back a new, UK-wide EU referendum but said there was ""no guarantee that fixes the problem for Scotland"", as ""we could end up with exactly the same result we had in 2016"" - with a majority in Scotland backing Remain, while the UK as a whole votes to Leave. Nicola Sturgeon wants to hold a new Scottish independence referendum in 2020 Questioned about how swiftly an independent Scotland could re-enter the EU, Ms Sturgeon said she did not want to set out a ""specific timescale"", but said talks she had had previously meant she thought it would be ""relatively quick"". She explained: ""We understand the conditions we would require to meet, and the discussions that would require to take place. But if we're in a position of Scotland being taken out of the European Union then we will be seeking a way back in."" The SNP currently plan to have Scotlandcontinue to use the poundin the years immediately after independence, before establishing a new currency after a series of stringent economic tests are met. Challenged on whether Scotland could join the EU while using the currency of a non-member state, Ms Sturgeon said this was possible. Watch the Andrew Neil interview with Nicola Sturgeon on the BBC iPlayer She said: ""We would be setting up a central bank, the infrastructure that is required for that, that is part of the discussion we would have with the EU, but it is not true to say we would have had to establish an independent currency before joining the European Union."" The MSP added: ""We would have a discussion with the EU about the journey an independent Scotland was on in terms of currency, and the accession if Scotland was already out of the EU to the point where we rejoined the EU. ""Scotland faces right now the uncertainty of being ripped out of the EU against our own will. It's not of our making. And we need to plot the best way forward for our country where we are in charge of the decision that we make."" The SNP's currency plan would see Scotland continue to use the pound in the years immediately after independence Ms Sturgeon also said an independent Scotland would ""aspire to run a surplus"" through faster economic growth, which she said would be aided by remaining in or returning to the EU. Pressed on trade friction if Scotland was inside the EU and the rest of the UK was not, Ms Sturgeon said it was ""a priority"" to ensure smooth movement of goods and services. Sturgeon: Scrapping Trident is SNP red line Can Nicola Stugeon deliver Scottish independence? She said: ""We don't yet know what the UK's final relationship with the EU will be. Once we have clarity on that we have to understand the implications and set out clearly how we deal with those, in order to keep trade flowing between Scotland and England, which is in our interests and in the interests of the rest of the UK. ""It is also in our interests to stay in the single market, which is eight times the size of the UK market. The experience of Ireland, albeit at a different time in history, is when they combined independence with membership of the EU, their exports to the EU grew and they became more prosperous. That's the best of both worlds I believe Scotland can attain."" Ms Sturgeon also came under pressure on her domestic record on health which has seenScotland's largest health board being placed in ""special measures""andcalls for her health secretary to resign. A recent report by Audit Scotland highlighted that just two out of eight key waiting time standards had been met and warned thatthe NHS in Scotland could face a Â£1.8bn shortfall in less than five yearsif it is not reformed. Ms Sturgeon acknowledged there were problems, adding: ""All health services everywhere face these challenges. We are not immune from that but I believe we are doing the things that are required."" The Conservatives have said a Jeremy Corbyn government at Westminster - potentiallysupported on an issue-by-issue basis by the SNP- could lead to two referendums in 2020, on Brexit and independence. Prime Minister Boris Johnson saida ""coalition of chaos"" between the two partieswould be a ""nightmare on Downing Street"". Launching his party's manifesto, he ""confidently prophesised"" that in 10 years' time ""people will be passionately proud of their Scottish identity, and their Welsh and Northern Irish, and - yes - their English identity"". Plaid Cymru leader would take Wales back into EU He added: ""We will also all be a proud strong and whole United Kingdom, more united than ever, flying that red, white and blue union flag that represents the best of our values, from democracy and the rule of law.""

Scottish leader Richard Leonard told BBC Scotland on Monday that arequest for a referendum ""would not be blocked""by a UK Labour government if there was a pro-independence majority after the Holyrood elections in 2021.

"Children will be taught about injustice and the role of the British Empire as part of the national curriculum under Labour, Jeremy Corbyn has said. At the launch of his race and faith manifesto on Tuesday, the Labour leader said a new trust will educate on how to address the legacy of slavery. He also set out policies on how to combat anti-Semitism in Britain. The Tories said it was ""staggering"" to see Labour ""lecture people"" during a probe over claims of anti-Semitism. But National Education Union joint general secretary Mary Bousted welcomed Labour's ""set of joined-up proposals to proactively tackle racism"". Meanwhile, in a letter to the Times, Ephraim Mirvis, the Orthodox chief rabbi of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,  has attacked the ""utterly inadequate"" response of the Labour leadership in dealing with anti-Semitism allegations. He said there was anxiety in the Jewish community over a Labour government and he called on the public to ""vote with their conscience"". Speaking at an event in Tottenham, north London, Mr Corbyn said: ""Anti-Semitism in any form is vile and wrong, it is an evil within our society"". ""There is no place whatsoever for anti-Semitism in any shape or form or in any place whatsoever in modern Britain and under a Labour government it will not be tolerated in any form whatsoever,"" he added. Chief Rabbi in election attack on Labour Ethnic minorities face Â£3.2bn 'pay penalty' Corbyn: Teach kids about legacy of UK empire A guide to Labour anti-Semitism claims Mr Corbyn made the comments while launching  - with shadow women and equalities secretary Dawn Butler and shadow home secretary Diane Abbott - the party's race and faith manifesto with pledges to improve social justice and human rights. If Labour wins the 12 December election, the party says an ""emancipation educational trust"" would be formed ""to ensure historical injustice, colonialism and role of the British Empire is taught in the national curriculum"". Mr Corbyn said the history of colonialism - including the ""unbelievable levels of brutality"" of the slave trade - should be ""part and parcel of what our children learn all year round"" and ""not just in Black History Month"". Labour wants to review the national curriculum The trust would educate on migration and how to address the legacy of slavery and teach how it ""interrupted a rich and powerful black history"". The national curriculum will also be reviewed by the party to ensure it teaches children about racism, anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, xenophobia and black history, and to continue education about the Holocaust. Also, the party says it wants to extend pay gap reporting to BAME (black, Asian and minority ethnic) groups for businesses with 250 employees or more. Labour's other proposals include: Creating a race equality unit within the Treasury, which will review major spending announcements for its impact on BAME communities Review ""rip-off"" charges for passports, visas and tests from the Home Office, with a view to lower the cost Review the under-representation of BAME teachers in schools An independent review of far-right extremism On guaranteeing the security of the Jewish community, Labour says it will amend the law to include attacks on places of worship as a specific aggravated offence. Labour has also pledged to work with social media platforms including Twitter, YouTube and Facebook ""to combat the rise of anti-Semitism online"". ""Labour has already been working with Facebook to take action against groups and individuals which have hijacked Labour's name to share anti-Semitic content,"" the party said. The Equality and Human Rights Commissionlaunched a formal investigation in Mayinto the Labour Party over allegations of anti-Semitism. It is formally looking into whether Labour has ""unlawfully discriminated against, harassed or victimised people because they are Jewish"". At the time, Labour said the party was ""anti-racist"" and would ""fully co-operate"" with the investigation. Ahead of his speech at the Bernie Grant Arts Centre, Mr Corbyn said Labour ""will do everything necessary to guarantee the security of the Jewish community, defend the Jewish way of life and the right to live it freely, and to combat rising anti-Semitism in our country and across Europe"". Mr Corbyn called Labour ""the party of equality and human rights"" and said it would ""tackle head-on the barriers that have unfairly held back so many people and communities"". Ms Butler said: ""Only by acknowledging the historical injustices faced by our communities can we work towards a better future that is prosperous for all, that isn't blighted by austerity and the politics of fear."" Conservative Home Secretary Priti Patel said it was ""staggering"" that Labour ""sees fit to lecture people about race and faith"" during the anti-Semitism investigation. Dr Bousted said the National Education Union welcomed the proposal for a ""new emancipation educational trust"". ""All young people benefit from learning about how human rights were won and about the struggle against colonialism and racial injustice,"" she said.

"Atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases once again reached new highs in 2018. TheWorld Meteorological Organization,external(WMO) says the increase in CO2 was just above the average rise recorded over the last decade. Levels of other warming gases, such as methane and nitrous oxide, have also surged by above average amounts. Since 1990 there's been an increase of 43% in the warming effect on the climate of long lived greenhouse gases. China coal surge threatens Paris climate targets Musicians 'have to be proactive' on climate change Climate signal links global floods and fires The WMO report looks at concentrations of warming gases in the atmosphere rather than just emissions. The difference between the two is that emissions refer to the amount of gases that go up into the atmosphere from the use of fossil fuels, such as burning coal for electricity and from deforestation. Concentrations are what's left in the air after a complex series of interactions between the atmosphere, the oceans, the forests and the land. About a quarter of all carbon emissions are absorbed by the seas, and a similar amount by land and trees. This video can not be played How to reduce your carbon footprint when you fly Using data from monitoring stations in the Arctic and all over the world, researchers say that in 2018 concentrations of CO2 reached 407.8 parts per million (ppm), up from 405.5ppm a year previously. This increase was above the average for the last 10 years and is 147% of the ""pre-industrial"" level in 1750. The WMO also records concentrations of other warming gases, including methane and nitrous oxide. About 40% of the methane emitted into the air comes from natural sources, such as wetlands, with 60% from human activities, including cattle farming, rice cultivation and landfill dumps. Methane is now at 259% of the pre-industrial level and the increase seen over the past year was higher than both the previous annual rate and the average over the past 10 years. Nitrous oxide is emitted from natural and human sources, including from the oceans and from fertiliser-use in farming. According to the WMO, it is now at 123% of the levels that existed in 1750. Last year's increase in concentrations of the gas, which can also harm the ozone layer, was bigger than the previous 12 months and higher than the average of the past decade. What concerns scientists is the overall warming impact of all these increasing concentrations. Known as total radiative forcing, this effect has increased by 43% since 1990, and is not showing any indication of stopping. ""There is no sign of a slowdown, let alone a decline, in greenhouse gases concentration in the atmosphere despite all the commitments under the Paris agreement on climate change,"" said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas. ""We need to translate the commitments into action and increase the level of ambition for the sake of the future welfare of mankind,"" he added. ""It is worth recalling that the last time the Earth experienced a comparable concentration of CO2 was three to five million years ago. Back then, the temperature was 2-3C warmer, sea level was 10-20m higher than now,"" said Mr Taalas. The UN Environment Programme will report shortly on the gap between what actions countries are taking to cut carbon and what needs to be done to keep under the temperature targets agreed in the Paris climate pact. Preliminary findings from this study, published during the UN Secretary General's special climate summit last September, indicated that emissions continued to rise during 2018. Both reports will help inform delegates from almost 200 countries who will meet in Madrid next week for COP25, the annual round of international climate talks.

"Ephraim Mirvis urged people to vote ""with their conscience"" The chief rabbi has strongly criticised Labour, claiming the party is not doing enough to root out anti-Jewish racism - and asked people to ""vote with their conscience"" in the general election. Inthe Times,external, Ephraim Mirvis said ""a new poison - sanctioned from the very top - has taken root"" in the party. Labour's claim it had investigated all cases of anti-Semitism in its ranks was a ""mendacious fiction"", he added. But Jeremy Corbyn said the party had taken ""rapid and effective"" action. At the launch of the party's""race and faith manifesto"",the Labour leader said anti-Jewish racism was ""vile and wrong"" and would not be tolerated in any form under a future Labour government. He said internal processes for dealing with anti-Semitism cases were ""constantly under review"" and his door would be open to Rabbi Mirvis and other faith leaders to discuss their concerns if he entered Downing Street. Labour has been beset by allegations of anti-Semitism for more than three years, leading to the suspension of a number of high-profile figures such as Ken Livingstone and Chris Williamson, and an unprecedented investigation by the Equality and Human Rights Commission. A number of prominent Jewish Labour politicians, including Luciana Berger and Louise Ellman, have quit the party after being the subject of anti-Semitic abuse on social media while others have accused Mr Corbyn ofpersonally endorsing anti-Semitic tropes and imagery. In his article, the Orthodox chief rabbi of Great Britain and Northern Ireland - who is the spiritual leader of the United Synagogue, the largest umbrella group of Jewish communities in the country - says raising his concerns ""ranks among the most painful moments I have experienced since taking office"". But he claims ""the overwhelming majority of British Jews are gripped by anxiety"" at the prospect of a Labour victory in 12 December's general election. Live: Latest from the campaign trail A guide to Labour anti-Semitism claims Tory candidate suspended over anti-Semitism Labour hopeful 'in controversial group in October' He writes: ""The way in which the leadership of the Labour Party has dealt with anti-Jewish racism is incompatible with the British values of which we are so proud - of dignity and respect for all people. ""It has left many decent Labour members and parliamentarians, both Jewish and non-Jewish, ashamed of what has transpired."" He adds that it was ""not my place to tell any person how they should vote"" but he urged the public to ""vote with their conscience"". The chief rabbi claimed the response of Labour's leadership to threats against parliamentarians, members and staff has been ""utterly inadequate"" and said it ""can no longer claim to be the party of equality and anti-racism"". Mike Katz, the chair of the Jewish Labour Movement group which is officially affiliated to the party, said the chief rabbi was ""absolutely right"" and there had been a failure of leadership over anti-Semitism in Labour. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, said the chief rabbi's ""unprecedented"" intervention ""ought to alert us to the deep sense of insecurity and fear felt by many British Jews"". In a statement, he said everyone should be able to ""live in accordance with their beliefs and freely express their culture and faith"". This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn says anti-Semitism is 'a poison' (07/11/19) The Labour peer Lord Dubs, the child refugee campaigner who fled Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia in the 1930s, said he regretted some of the language Mr Corbyn had used in the past about Israel and the fact he had met with groups who denied its right to exist. But he told BBC Radio 4's Today these episodes were ""quite a long time ago"" and had to be seen ""in the context"" of Mr Corbyn's support for peace in the Middle East. This video can not be played Lord Dubs responds to chief rabbi criticisms of Labour Party ""I think things have happened under his leadership which should have been stopped way back,"" he added. ""I believe the Labour party is moving forward. It is not good enough what has happened in the past."" This is a sweeping and unequivocal condemnation of Labour's leadership, its treatment of Jewish parliamentarians and its handling of allegations of anti-Semitism. It's also highly unusual for such an intervention by the leader of a religious denomination during a general election campaign. The chief rabbi has pastoral oversight for a large proportion of people who identify as Jewish in the United Kingdom. Last week, the Archbishops of Canterbury and York appealed to voters and politicians to ""honour the truth"" and ""challenge falsehoods"" but there was no specific criticism of individual candidates nor their party leaders. But the chief rabbi's article asks if Jeremy Corbyn is fit for high office and calls on voters to consider what the result of this election ""will say about the moral compass of this country?"" Last year, three Jewish newspapers, - The Jewish Chronicle, The Jewish News and The Jewish Telegraph - published exactly the same front cover on 25 July - arguing that a Labour government under the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn would prove ""an existential threat"" to British Jewry. The chief rabbi, in this highly critical column, is saying much the same. The Labour leader faced criticism from Jewish groups when he said in last week's general election ITV leader's debate that the party had ""investigated every single case"" raised by complainants. The chief rabbi takes issue with Mr Corbyn's claim, citing figures from the Jewish Labour Movement of ""at least 130 outstanding cases"". At an event in Tottenham, north London, the Labour leader did not directly address the number of outstanding cases but defended the party's disciplinary processes as being ""rapid and effective"". ""Anti-Semitism in any form is vile and wrong, it is an evil within our society,"" he said. ""There is no place whatsoever for anti-Semitism in any shape or form or in any place whatsoever in modern and Britain and under a Labour government it will not be tolerated in any form whatsoever."" He added: ""In government our door will be open to all faith leaders. Chief Rabbi welcome. Archbishop of Canterbury welcome. Those from the Hindu community are all very welcome."" South-African born Rabbi Mirvis became chief rabbi in 2013.In a Facebook post in July,external, he congratulated Boris Johnson on his election as Conservative leader, describing the new prime minister as a ""long-standing friend and champion of the Jewish community"". According to the British Board of Deputies,,externalthere are between 260,000 and 300,000 Jews in England and Wales. Around half belong to the Central Orthodox denomination which includes the United Synagogue, led by the chief rabbi. Measures to combat anti-Semitism were among a number of policies unveiled by the party, including: Changing the law to include attacks on places of worship as a specific aggravated offence Working with social media firms to combat the rise of anti-Semitism online An independent review into the threat of far-right extremism and how to tackle it Reviewing the national curriculum to ensure it teaches about racism, anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, xenophobia and black history, and to continue education about the Holocaust Ensuring coroners services meet the needs of faith communities, with ""out of hours"" services to ensure quick burials when required, allowing some Jewish and Muslim families to bury loved ones in accordance with their religious practice The Muslim Council of Britain, which has repeatedly criticised the Conservatives for failing to address anti-Muslim prejudice amongst their members, said not enough was being done to tackle racism ""whether from the left or the right"". It said British Muslims would ""agree on the importance of voting with their conscience"".

"This Hubble Space Telescope image shows Supernova 1987A within the Large Magellanic Cloud Scientists believe they've finally tracked down the dead remnant from Supernova 1987A - one of their favourite star explosions. Astronomers knew the object must exist but had always struggled to identify its location because of a shroud of obscuring dust. Now, a UK-led team thinks the remnant's hiding place can be pinpointed from the way it's been heating up that dust. The researchers refer to the area of interest as ""the blob"". ""It's so much hotter than its surroundings, the blob needs some explanation. It really stands out from its neighbouring dust clumps,"" Prof Haley Gomez from Cardiff University told BBC News. ""We think it's being heated by the hot neutron star created in the supernova."" Attenborough: World 'changing habits' on plastic New hope for trees affected by ash dieback Geologist blasts society's links with oil firms When telescopes first spotted the explosion in 1987, it caused huge excitement. Sited in the Large Magellanic Cloud, some 168,000 light-years from Earth - the blast was the nearest, brightest supernova seen in the night sky in 400 years. As such, it's become the test case for what we think we know about stars when their fuel runs out and they suffer a cataclysmic collapse. The team used the Alma facility to study the dust and gas at the heart of Supernova 1987A Three decades on, astronomers routinely observe Supernova 1987A and its constantly developing form. It is a thing of beauty: it has a series of bright rings that represent bands of gas and dust thrown out by the star in its dying phases and which have since been excited by the expanding shockwaves emitted in the end-moment explosion. One of these rings looks like a string of pearls, and it's at the centre of this celestial jewellery that the scientists reckon they've now located the star remnant. It should be a dense object composed entirely of neutron particles and measuring just a few tens of kilometres across. The thick cloud of dust in which it sits, however, is perhaps 30 times the size of our Solar System and this makes the neutron star impossible to see directly. ""We see the recycled light, if you like. The hot neutron star heats the dust grains and as they absorb that energy - they shine at sub-millimetre wavelengths. That's what we detect,"" explained Prof Gomez. The team has been probing the area of interest using data from Europe's now defunct Herschel space telescope and the international Atacama Large Millimeter Array (Alma) facility in Chile. Alma has the resolution to tease out the important details What Alma in particular reveals is that the blob also resides in a region deficient in carbon monoxide (CO) molecules. The CO is being destroyed, presumably in the same heating process that's making the dust shine. Unfortunately, it's difficult to be more descriptive about the neutron star because of its dust shroud, but the group expects this to change with time. In maybe 50 to 100 years, the dust should clear to reveal the object's true guise. A paper detailing the new findings is published in The Astrophysical Journal,external. Its lead author is Cardiff's Dr Phil Cigan. He told BBC News: ""The amazing thing about [Supernova 1987A] is that we are watching the changes in real time, seeing how it evolves over months and years. It's like watching the plot develop in the acts of a play. ""By monitoring its progress, we can compare the reality to what different models predict, and we are eagerly anticipating seeing the direct radiation from the neutron star when the dust thins out."" Astronomers are interested in supernovas because they are integral to the evolution of the Universe. The explosions stir up the environment, nudging nearby gas clouds to gravitationally fall in on themselves and birth new stars. The dust ejected in supernovas also seeds the cosmos with the heavier elements that go into building rocky planets.

"The mountain forests in Kenya and Tanzania contain many threatened and rare plant species A third of tropical African plants are on the path to extinction, according to a new assessment. Much of western Africa, Ethiopia, and parts of Tanzania and the Democratic Republic of the Congo are the hardest hit regions, standing to lose more than 40% of their richness of plants. Species at risk include trees, shrubs, herbs and woody vines. Threats include deforestation, population growth and climate change, the scientists said. ""Biodiversity provides countless benefits to humans and losing diversity jeopardises our future,"" said lead researcher Dr Thomas Couvreur of the French National Institute for Sustainable Development. Loss of biodiversity will be particularly problematic in tropical Africa, ""a region of incredible diversity but with major social and political challenges and expected rapid population growth over the next decades"", he added. An example of a critically endangered tree species from Tanzania The findings of the study, published inScience Advances,external, are based on a revised method for assessing extinction risk. Plant extinction 'bad news for all species' Ethiopia 'breaks' tree-planting record Seeds of life- The plants suited to climate change. Official assessments of extinction are recorded inThe Red List of Threatened Species,external, published by theInternational Union for Conservation of Nature - IUCN,external. Example of an endangered orchid species from Cameroon and Gabon So far, almost nine in 10 mammals and two-thirds of birds have been assessed, but less than 8% of vascular plants (flowering plants and most other plants, excluding mosses and algae). The researchers used a similar, but more speedy, method to assess the likely extinction risk of more than 20,000 plant species. They found that 33% of the species are potentially threatened with extinction, and another third of species are likely rare, potentially becoming threatened in the near future. This is mainly due to human activities such as deforestation, land-use changes, population growth, economic development, and climate change, they said.

"Atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases once again reached new highs in 2018. TheWorld Meteorological Organization,external(WMO) says the increase in CO2 was just above the average rise recorded over the last decade. Levels of other warming gases, such as methane and nitrous oxide, have also surged by above average amounts. Since 1990 there's been an increase of 43% in the warming effect on the climate of long lived greenhouse gases. China coal surge threatens Paris climate targets Musicians 'have to be proactive' on climate change Climate signal links global floods and fires The WMO report looks at concentrations of warming gases in the atmosphere rather than just emissions. The difference between the two is that emissions refer to the amount of gases that go up into the atmosphere from the use of fossil fuels, such as burning coal for electricity and from deforestation. Concentrations are what's left in the air after a complex series of interactions between the atmosphere, the oceans, the forests and the land. About a quarter of all carbon emissions are absorbed by the seas, and a similar amount by land and trees. This video can not be played How to reduce your carbon footprint when you fly Using data from monitoring stations in the Arctic and all over the world, researchers say that in 2018 concentrations of CO2 reached 407.8 parts per million (ppm), up from 405.5ppm a year previously. This increase was above the average for the last 10 years and is 147% of the ""pre-industrial"" level in 1750. The WMO also records concentrations of other warming gases, including methane and nitrous oxide. About 40% of the methane emitted into the air comes from natural sources, such as wetlands, with 60% from human activities, including cattle farming, rice cultivation and landfill dumps. Methane is now at 259% of the pre-industrial level and the increase seen over the past year was higher than both the previous annual rate and the average over the past 10 years. Nitrous oxide is emitted from natural and human sources, including from the oceans and from fertiliser-use in farming. According to the WMO, it is now at 123% of the levels that existed in 1750. Last year's increase in concentrations of the gas, which can also harm the ozone layer, was bigger than the previous 12 months and higher than the average of the past decade. What concerns scientists is the overall warming impact of all these increasing concentrations. Known as total radiative forcing, this effect has increased by 43% since 1990, and is not showing any indication of stopping. ""There is no sign of a slowdown, let alone a decline, in greenhouse gases concentration in the atmosphere despite all the commitments under the Paris agreement on climate change,"" said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas. ""We need to translate the commitments into action and increase the level of ambition for the sake of the future welfare of mankind,"" he added. ""It is worth recalling that the last time the Earth experienced a comparable concentration of CO2 was three to five million years ago. Back then, the temperature was 2-3C warmer, sea level was 10-20m higher than now,"" said Mr Taalas. The UN Environment Programme will report shortly on the gap between what actions countries are taking to cut carbon and what needs to be done to keep under the temperature targets agreed in the Paris climate pact. Preliminary findings from this study, published during the UN Secretary General's special climate summit last September, indicated that emissions continued to rise during 2018. Both reports will help inform delegates from almost 200 countries who will meet in Madrid next week for COP25, the annual round of international climate talks.

Last year, three Jewish newspapers - The Jewish Chronicle, The Jewish News and The Jewish Telegraph - published exactly the same front cover on 25th July 2018 - arguing that a Labour government under the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn would prove ""an existential threat"" to British Jewry. The Chief Rabbi, in this highly critical column, is saying much the same. ""Jeremy Corbyn is a lifelong campaigner against anti-Semitism and has made absolutely clear it has no place in our party and society and that no-one who engages in it does so in his name,"" a Labour spokesman says. ""A Labour government will guarantee the security of the Jewish community, defend and support the Jewish way of life, and combat rising anti-Semitism in our country and across Europe. Our race and faith manifesto [which will be launched tomorrow], sets out our policies to achieve this."" The Chief Rabbi says it is a ""mendacious fiction"" that Labour has investigated all outstanding cases of anti-Semitism, claiming that at least 130 cases before the party are outstanding and ""thousands"" were reported but remain unresolved. But Labour says: ""The 130 figure is inaccurate and it is categorically untrue to suggest there are thousands of outstanding cases. We are taking robust action to root out anti-Semitism in the party, with swift suspensions, processes for rapid expulsions and an education programme for members."" Morte on that opinion piece from the Chief Rabbi. Ephraim Mirvis,writing in the Times,external, says that the ""Jewish community has watched with incredulity as supporters of the Labour leadership have hounded parliamentarians, members and even staff out of the party for challenging anti-Jewish racism"".

""When December 12 arrives, I ask every person to vote with their conscience. Be in no doubt, the very soul of our nation is at stake,"" he says. The Chief Rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, criticises the Labour Party, writing in the Times that it is not doing enough to root out anti-Semitism. He asks people to vote with their conscience in the forthcoming general election. ""Prime Ditherer"" - used as an insult towards Jeremy Corbyn and his neutral stance on Brexit - has been the Tories' attack slogan of the day. It was unveiled on a Conservative election poster (with a picture of Jeremy Corbyn) by Culture Secretary Nicky Morgan this morning. Health Secretary Matt Hancock later used the words in an interview, saying: ""So Jeremy Corbyn is the prime ditherer as demonstrated by his position, his various positions on Brexit, and his lack of a position now."" And then Boris Johnson later said of Mr Corbyn: ""He doesn't want to be prime minister, he wants to be prime ditherer. He used to be indecisive, now he's not so sure."" Nicky Morgan claimed it was Conservative Central HQ who came up with the phrase. But look at this tweet from 2016,  and the accompanying Sunday Mirror column, and it does seem that Labour's John Prescott was the one who coined the phrase - about then-PM Theresa May.

Finally, Ms Sturgeon - a former health minister - is challenged on the performance of Scotland's NHS under the SNP. Mr Neil says Scotland is failing to meet its target for the number of patients treated within 12 weeks, at only 72%. ""Itâs not good enough,"" Ms Sturgeon says. But she says they are taking steps to address it with an Â£850m plan. Mr Neil brings up ""children dying in a Glasgow hospital because the water is contaminated"", Scotland's drug problem and a new Edinburgh hospital which has not opened after nine years. Ms Sturgeon says she is increasing investment in drug services and there are inquiries into the other issues. ""Yes, we have challenges in Scotland but we are dealing with
these challenges more effectively than the rest of the UK,"" she says. Mr Neil quotes an assessment by the Institute for Fiscal Studies which says that independence would require another decade of ""restraint on public spending"", saying that austerity would continue. But Ms Sturgeon says she doesn't accept that assessment. She says if the growth commission's recommendations had been followed over the last ten years, Scotland would have escaped austerity. The SNP has warned that trade friction caused by Brexit
could mean 80,000 jobs lost in Scotland. Mr Neil asks, why wonât trade friction
with the rest of the UK harm the economy after independence? The SNP leader says we âdonât yet know the final
relationship with EUâ and adds that itâs not independence that causes the trade friction, ""itâs Brexit"". She says it's in Scotland's interests to remain in the EU, a much larger market, and draws a comparison with Ireland's success in increasing exports. Challenged on how quickly Scotland could rejoin the EU if Brexit
goes ahead and the country votes for independence, Ms Sturgeon says she is ânot
going to give a specific timescaleâ but it âcould be relatively quickâ. But Mr Neil says Scotlandâs Growth Commission says it could be
five or ten years, as the country would need to establish its own currency. Ms Sturgeon says she is âabsolutely certainâ that an independent
currency would not be a requirement. âWe would have a discussion with the EU
about the journey"" Scotland was on in terms of an independent currency, she
says. Mr Neil says Scotland would also be required to build
substantial reserves in its new currency and asks how it can do that with the
largest deficit in Europe. Ms Sturgeon says Scotland is reducing its deficit faster than
expected. âOur task is to get our deficit reducing faster. That is principally
through growing our economy faster, which remaining in the EU or returning to the
EU helps us to do,â she says. This video can not be played General election 2019: Independent Scotland joining EU? Mr Neil turns his questions to the practicalities of
securing a Scottish independence referendum and establishing Scotland as a
separate state. Ms Sturgeon previously said Brexit was a âmaterial changeâ that
justified asking the Scottish people about independence again. But Mr Neil
asks, if she blocks Brexit, doesnât that justification disappear? Ms Sturgeon says: âThe material change is the way in which
Scotland has had it completely demonstrated to it over the last three years
that our views and our voice doesnât matter.â She adds that âour future path as a country is not in our
hands, itâs in the hands of Westminster politicians like Boris Johnson with his
strings being pulled by Nigel Farageâ. The other requirement for another referendum was for âclear
and sustainedâ support for independence in opinion polls, says Mr Neil. He says
that hasnât been met either. âAlmost all opinion polls show increasing support for
independence. They show increasing support for a second referendum,â she says. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,1.166669e-10
"Mo Robinson is accused of 39 counts of manslaughter A lorry driver who is accused over the deaths of 39 migrants in Essex has admitted plotting to assist illegal immigration. Maurice Robinson pleaded guilty at the Old Bailey to conspiring with others to assist illegal immigration between 1 May 2018 and 24 October 2019. The 25-year-old, from County Armagh, is accused of being part of a larger plot to bring people into the UK illegally. Mr Robinson was not asked to plead to 39 charges of manslaughter. The charges relate to the deaths of 39 Vietnamese people, including children, who were discovered in the back of a refrigerated lorry being driven by Mr Robinson in Grays on 23 October. Mr Robinson, who appeared via video-link from Belmarsh prison, also admitted acquiring criminal property - namely cash - between 1 May 2018 and 24 October 2019. As well as the manslaughter charges, Mr Robinson is accused of conspiracy to commit human trafficking offences and transferring criminal property. The defendant, of Laurel Drive, Craigavon, was remanded into custody until a further hearing on 13 December.

"This video can not be played Jamie Heywood, who manages Uber's UK operation, says the firm will appeal Uber will not be granted a new licence to operate in London after repeated safety failures, Transport for London (TfL) has said. The regulator said the taxi app was not ""fit and proper"" as a licence holder, despite having made a number of positive changes to its operations. Uber initially lost its licence in 2017 but was granted two extensions, the most recent of which expires on Monday. The firm will appeal and can continue to operate during that process. London is one of Uber's top five markets globally and it has about 45,000 drivers in the city. Overall, there are 126,000 licensed private hire and black cabs in the capital. If its appeal is unsuccessful, some think Uber drivers would move over to rival ride-sharing firms such as Bolt and Kapten.""There would be competition that would fill that void quite quickly,"" Fiona Cincotta, a market analyst at City Index told the BBC. TfL said it had identified a ""pattern of failures"" in London that placed passenger safety at risk. These included a change to Uber's systems which allowed unauthorised drivers to upload their photos to other Uber driver accounts. It meant there were at least 14,000 fraudulent trips in London in late 2018 and early 2019, TfL said. The regulator also found dismissed or suspended drivers had been able to create Uber accounts and carry passengers.  In one example, a driver was able to continue working for Uber, despite the fact his private hire licence had been revoked after he was cautioned for distributing indecent images of children. Uber's paradox: Gig work app traps and frees its drivers What do drivers think of Uber? Helen Chapman, director of licensing at TfL, said: ""While we recognise Uber has made improvements, it is unacceptable that Uber has allowed passengers to get into minicabs with drivers who are potentially unlicensed and uninsured."" London Mayor Sadiq Khan said: ""I know this decision may be unpopular with Uber users, but their safety is the paramount concern. Regulations are there to keep Londoners safe."" Donna Stevens says her experiences of using Uber in London have ""always been positive"". In her job as a carer she often works late, so regularly uses the service. ""The drivers are friendly, courteous and professional. I can't afford to get a metered taxi."" She says that if Uber were to go, she would probably have to go back to using public transport late at night, which does not make her feel safe. However, another reader, Kay, says she would not be sad to see Uber go. ""I complained a couple of months ago about a driver who made me feel so uncomfortable I abandoned the ride and walked home in the dark at 11 o'clock at night instead of staying in his cab."" She says Uber gave her a Â£5 credit but did not apologise. ""How is it OK to employ drivers that make women feel unsafe?"" she says. Uber lovers in London, fear not! The company's cars will not suddenly disappear from the capital's streets. Uber is going to appeal against this decision so a magistrate will have to decide whether Uber is fit to hold a licence in London, or not. A decision from a magistrates court could take weeks or months and unless the court decides otherwise, Uber will retain its licence during this period too. When TfL decided not to renew Uber's licence in 2017, the company addressed some of the issues raised by TfL back then and then a magistrate later granted Uber a new licence. On the face of it TfL is standing tough against perceived failings by Uber. But in effect it is letting the courts decide, at a later date, whether Uber should have a licence, or not. Uber said the decision was ""extraordinary and wrong"". It said it had audited every driver in London over the past two months and strengthened its processes. Boss Dara Khosrowshahi tweeted: ""We understand we're held to a high bar, as we should be. But this TfL decision is just wrong. Over the last 2 years we have fundamentally changed how we operate in London."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

According to Uber,external, 24% of its sales come from just five cities, including London. The others are Los Angeles, New York City, San Francisco and SÃ£o Paulo in Brazil. In a public filing, it said: ""Any inability to operate in London, as well as the publicity concerning any such termination or non-renewal, would adversely affect our business, revenue, and operating results. ""We cannot predict whether the TfL decision, or future regulatory decisions or legislation in other jurisdictions, may embolden or encourage other authorities to take similar actions even where we are operating according to the terms of an existing licence or permit."" In May, hundreds of Uber drivers in London, Birmingham, Nottingham and Glasgow staged a protest against the firm over pay and conditions Business lobby group the CBI said customers valued Uber, and encouraged both sides to find a resolution. But the Unite union - which believes Uber has unfairly taken business from black cab drivers - welcomed the news. ""Uber's DNA is about driving down standards and creating a race to the bottom which is not in the best interests of professional drivers or customers,"" said Jim Kelly, chair of Unite's London and Eastern cab section. Uber has faced pressure from regulators around the world over the way it treats its drivers, competition concerns, and fears about passenger safety. The US firmpulled out of Denmarkin 2017 because of new taxi laws that required drivers to have fare meters and seat sensors. Bulgaria and Hungary both stripped Uber's right to operate following pressure from local taxi unions. And in May, the ride-hailing firm pulled its UberXL service in Turkey without saying why. TfL first declined to renew Uber's licence in September 2017, again over safety concerns. Back then it cited Uber's approach to carrying out background checks on drivers and reporting serious criminal offences. Uber's use of secret software, called ""Greyball"", which could be used to block regulators from monitoring the app, was another factor, although Uber said it had never been used in the UK. However, TfL granted Uber a 15-month licence extension - later extended by two months - conditional on it making improvements to its business. TfL can offer licences of up to five years, but it has been more stringent of late. In July, Indian ride-hailing company Ola got a 15-month agreement for its entry into the London market, while ViaVan got a three-year licence renewal. Uber: Will it get its London licence back?

"This video can not be played Blue Story is the tale of two friends who become rivals A second cinema chain has pulled the gang-themed film Blue Story after seven police officers were injured during a brawl at an entertainment complex. It comes after youths, some armed with machetes, sparked a police operation at the Star City multiplex in Birmingham. Vue has banned the film from its 91 UK and Ireland venues and Showcase has also dropped the movie. The move has prompted a backlash on social media with somelabelling the ban as ""racist"". Five teenagers including a girl, 13, were arrested in connection with the disturbance, which involved up to 100 young people in a public area of the multiplex, on Saturday night. In a statement, Vue said the film opened in 60 of its sites across the UK and Ireland on Friday. ""But during the first 24 hours of the film over 25 significant incidents were reported and escalated to senior management in 16 separate cinemas,"" it said. ""This is the biggest number we have ever seen for any film in a such a short time frame."" A spokeswoman for Vue confirmed police had been called to some of the incidents, but could not confirm exactly how many times. The Odeon chain says it is not withdrawing the film, but ""a number of security measures are in place"" for Blue Story screenings, though it refused to elaborate on what they are. In Birmingham, a note on the door of the Odeon cinema at the Broadway Plaza said staff would be carrying out bag searches throughout the day. The film's writer and director says it is about love not violence Blue Story's writer and director, Andrew Onwubolu, said Saturday's disturbance in Birmingham was ""truly unfortunate"". In an Instagram post on Sunday, the rapper-turned-filmmaker wrote: ""Sending love to all those involved in yesterday's violence at Star City in Birmingham. ""It's truly unfortunate that a small group of people can ruin things for everybody. ""Blue Story is a film about love not violence. ""I hope that the blame is placed with the individuals and not an indictment of the film itself. ""I pray that we can all learn to live with love and treat each other with tolerance and respect."" An online petition has been launched calling for the film to be reinstated at Vue cinemas. It attracted more than 6,700 signatures in 18 hours. The film was released last Friday The Vue chain has stressed the decision to pull the film was prompted only because of the risk of further violence. ""This decision is not, as some have alleged, based on biased assumptions or concern about the content of the film itself,"" it said. On Saturday, West Midlands Police officers drew Tasers and used a dispersal order to clear the Star City venue. Footage from inside the multiplex appeared to show fights and people on the floor screaming. This video can not be played Andrew Onwubolu, known as Rapman, wrote and directed the film The five teenagers - two girls aged 13 and 14 and three 14-year-old boys - have all now been bailed alongside a 19-year-old man. Four were held on suspicion of assaulting police and one of the boys was detained on suspicion of obstructing police. A group of youths, one of whom was carrying a machete, were caught on camera Another of the boys was arrested on suspicion of violent disorder after an image circulated on social media showing a number of youths, with one carrying a machete. West Midlands police and crime commissioner David Jamieson said the unrest was ""very worrying and very disturbing"". ""Some of these children were so young,"" he said. ""I think parents have a role if they see those sorts of [weapons] in the home, to discipline their own children."" The teenagers' bail conditions ban them from leaving home at night, as well as from Star City and any cinema in the UK, police said. This video can not be played Witness Rachael Allison was at the Birmingham Star City complex when a brawl broke out Announcing it was following Vue in cancelling all screenings, Showcase said: ""Due to the recent incidents tied to screenings of the film Blue Story, after careful consideration with the film's distributor, Showcase Cinemas has immediately removed the film from all of our participating cinemas. ""Any guests that have purchased tickets in advance can receive a full refund at the cinema box office. We remain in discussions with the distributor with regards to the possibility of reintroducing the film in due course. ""We apologise for any inconvenience but guest safety remains our top priority."" Blue Story, which was developed from a YouTube mini-series, follows the life of Timmy who lives in Lewisham but goes to school in Peckham - two parts of south-east London that have a notorious rivalry. ""That part of it was based on my life - it made my school experience very difficult,""director Onwubolu told Radio 1 Newsbeat. He said he wanted the audience to see past crime statistics and headlines about knife crime, to understand how a ""good kid"" can lose their way. ""They didn't come from child abuse or neglectful mothers. What kids go through in the school playground is so intense, it all starts there."" The film was developed from a YouTube mini-series BBC Films, which developed and co-financed the film, said it was an ""outstanding, critically acclaimed debut feature which powerfully depicts the futility of gang violence"". ""It's an important film from one of the UK's most exciting new filmmakers which we're proud to be part of,"" it added. Distributor Paramount Pictures said it was ""saddened"" by events at Star City but said the movie had had an ""incredibly positive reaction and fantastic reviews"". However, Errol Lawson, a reformed gangster from Birmingham, said the film was ""stirring up"" violence. ""The spirit behind it is stirring up this undercurrent, or supporting or fuelling this undercurrent, this narrative of violence, youth violence and disregard for life,"" he said. West Midlands Police has not asked for or recommended the film be pulled following Saturday's violence. Ch Supt Steve Graham said: ""I understand there is a lot of speculation on social media and people are citing that film. ""At this stage we are not jumping to any conclusions. That will form part of our investigations as it carries on."" 'Institutionally racist': Blue Story ban faces backlash Rapman: 'When I was at school, I focused on surviving' Girl, 13, among 'machete' brawl cinema arrests Police were called to the complex, in Nechells, at about 17:30 GMT and cleared the area by 21:00. The officers hurt during the disorder suffered minor facial injuries. Supt Ian Green said: ""This was a major outbreak of trouble which left families who were just trying to enjoy a night out at the cinema understandably frightened. ""We worked quickly to move the crowds on, but were met with a very hostile response and officers had to draw Tasers to restore order. ""It's clear that some of those who went to Star City were intent on causing trouble."" In Sheffield on Sunday evening, there was an increased police presence around Centertainment on Broughton Lane ahead of the showing of the film after disorder was reported outside the Cineworld within the complex on Saturday. ""Officers carried out patrols of the area to ensure everyone's safety,"" police said in a statement, adding that they would ""be liaising with Cineworld over the coming week to discuss further screenings of this film"".

"The crash happened on Saturday A woman says she only discovered a car had crashed into the front of her house and was on fire when a police officer told her. Sylvia Walden, 61, slept through the early morning smash before being woken by the sound of shouting. Three people suffered serious injuries in the incident on the A857 at Barvas in Lewis on Saturday. The car was involved in a police chase. A 32-year-old man was arrested in connection with road traffic offences. He is due to appear in court next month. Sylvia Walden said her first concern was for her dog Ms Walden, 61, was not injured in the incident. She said: ""I believe it was about 01:30. I was fast asleep and didn't hear the car go into the house. People think it rather funny I didn't get woken up by that."" Ms Walden added: ""I could hear shouting. I got up, opened the door and there was a police officer with a torch saying 'hello, hello this is the police. You need to get out of the house'."" She said her first concern was for her dog, but was told by the police officer that it was fine before adding that there was a car on fire in her garden. ""It was up against the house on fire,"" she said. The car had ended up upright on its bonnet, leaning against Ms Walden's property. Three people were seriously injured in the crash The driver and two passengers of the blue Vauxhall Zafira were taken to Western Isles Hospital in Stornoway for treatment to serious injuries. The incident has been referred to the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner (Pirc) by Police Scotland. It is thought the actions of officers in the lead-up to the crash will be looked into. A Pirc spokesman said: ""As is standard procedure, Police Scotland have referred to the Pirc the circumstances of an incident in the early hours of Saturday 23 November 2019 on the Isle of Lewis.

"Labour would not block indyref2 if pro-independence parties win a majority at the next Holyrood election, according to Scottish leader Richard Leonard. Mr Leonard said a Labour-led UK government would grant the powers to hold a second independence referendum in this scenario. However, he also said he still opposed breaking up the UK. Mr Leonard also promised ""further consultation"" on controversial plans for an oil and gas windfall tax. The Scottish Labour leader was speaking in a live interview and phone-in session on BBC Radio Scotland, which all of the country's main party leaders will take part in during the election campaign. Look back on the Richard Leonard interview and phone-in Scottish Labour calls for free school meals for all pupils Labour pledges Â£100bn investment in Scotland Labour's position on a second independence referendum has been thesubject of much focusduring the election campaign. Nicola Sturgeon has claimed Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn willhave little choice but to back a second independence referendumif he wants to be prime minister and Boris Johnson has ruled outgiving permission for another votewhile he is prime minister. Mr Leonard said his opposition to independence had not changed but added: ""If the SNP or other parties put in their manifesto that they wanted to hold a second independence referendum and they got a mandate for that, either in 2021 or at some future point, then of course what we are saying is that would not be blocked by a UK Labour Westminster government."" The Central Scotland MSP said that the independence question is a ""battle that will be won or lost in Scotland"" but an issue that could be reframed by the election of a Labour UK government. He said: ""The terms of the debate on the constitutional position in Scotland would change because, instead of a UK government which is embarking upon a programme of austerity, you would see a UK government embarking upon a programme of significant investment in both the economy and public services."" Mr Leonard also claimed the prospect of asecond Brexit vote under Labourand the chance of the UK staying in the EU would also weaken the SNP's argument for a second independence referendum. At the Scottish Labour general election manifesto launch Mr Leonard said the party's free school meals pledge was part of Labour's plan for ""transformational change"" across Scotland and the UK TheScottish Labour manifesto,externalpromised a windfall tax of the profits of the oil and gas industry. The idea has been controversial, especially in the north east of Scotland where many people are employed in the sector, and Mr Leonard used his interview to suggest it would be subject to consultation in the event of a UK Labour government being elected. He said:  ""We think there ought to be a windfall tax on the profits of the oil and gas sector; the level at which that is pitched, when that is introduced, is a matter of consultation and negotiation. ""It will form a fund to enable those currently employed in the oil and gas sector to change their occupation and roles into other part of the economy."" Mr Leonard also said the money raised from the levy is not an ""intrinsic part"" of Labour's spending plans. Concerns over Labour's proposed windfall tax on the oil and gas industry have been raised given the sector is still recovering from a recent downturn in fortunes On Brexit, Mr Leonard said he would again campaign to remain if there was a second Brexit referendum, in contrast to Jeremy Corbyn who said hewould remain neutralon the issue if prime minister. Elsewhere, Mr Leonard suggested a Labour promise to compensate more than three million women who lost out on years of state pension payments when their retirement age was raised could be funded by borrowing. It has been estimated this policy would cost Â£58bn and the Scottish Labour leader said governments can borrow money to pay for ""exceptional items"", insisting it is ""the right thing to do"". On a second independence referendum, Nicola Sturgeon said Labour would not ""walk away"" from a deal with the SNP if it allowed the party to get the keys to Number 10. Boris Johnson has ruled out granting a ""section 30 order"" - which grants permission for a new referendum from the UK government - while he is prime minister, arguing the issue is settled as, ""the people of Scotland, were told in 2014 that that was a once-in-a-generation event"". The Liberal Democrats have said a second referendum on the future of the UK is unnecessary and would be ""divisive"" with Scottish leader Willie Rennie claiminghis party was ""unique"" in this electionby opposing both Brexit and independence.

"This video can not be played Security camera footage showed figures with torches and tools smashing one of the cabinets Burglars have stolen three diamond jewellery sets from one of Europe's largest treasure collections - the Dresden Green Vault in eastern Germany. The historic sets consist of 37 parts each, and there are fears the thieves may try to break them up. Officials are still trying to establish exactly how much was stolen in the break-in early on Monday. Saxony's ruler, Augustus the Strong, created the collection in 1723 in what is one of the world's oldest museums. ""Three out of 10 diamond sets have gone,"" said Marion Ackermann, head of the Dresden state museums. Jewellery thefts that shocked the world Jewels seized in armed raid on luxury Paris hotel The stolen sets from the Green Vault (GrÃ¼nes GewÃ¶lbe) are reported to also include some rubies, emeralds and sapphires. The thieves - still on the run - removed part of an iron grille on a ground-floor window, then smashed the glass. The Green Vault is a world-famous treasure collection At about 05:00 (04:00 GMT) on Monday, firefighters were called to tackle a blaze in a nearby electricity junction box. There is speculation that the fire disabled the museum's alarm system. It put out some of the street lights. Police are examining CCTV footage which shows two suspects in the dark. But more people may have been involved in the robbery. A car found burning in Dresden early on Monday may have been the getaway vehicle used by the burglars, police say. Giant gold coin trial opens in Berlin The museum had guards on duty at night, Ms Ackermann said. Dozens of police cars are at the scene and the Green Vault in central Dresden is now shut. ""Three out of 10 diamond sets have gone,"" said Ms Ackermann. However, Dresden police and museum officials did not provide any further details. Ms Ackermann described them as ""priceless - we can't put a figure on it"". ""The items cannot be sold on the art market legally - they're too well known,"" she said. The baroque palace was hit in World War Two air raids, but Dresden restored it Ms Ackermann stressed that the cultural value of the unique collection was far greater than its material value. The popular German daily Bild saidthe thieves had grabbed jewels,externalworth â¬1bn (Â£855m). The collection is housed in eight ornate rooms in the Residenzschloss - a former royal palace. Three rooms were destroyed by Allied bombing in World War Two, but after the war, the museum was restored to its previous glory. It is called the Green Vault because some rooms were decorated with malachite-green paint. The Green Vault houses treasured items such as this 16th-Century Indian mother-of-pearl box The most valuable items are in the palace's historic section on the ground floor. There are about 3,000 items of jewellery and other treasures decorated with gold, silver, ivory and pearl. They include a figure of a moor studded with emeralds and a 648-carat sapphire - a royal gift from Russia's Tsar Peter the Great. One of the most valuable jewels is a 41-carat green diamond currently on show in New York. The collection was founded by Augustus the Strong. He was Elector of Saxony (a German prince entitled to take part in the election of the emperor) and later king of Poland. Saxony's minister-president, Michael Kretschmer, voiced outrage at the crime, saying ""not only were the state art collections burgled, but the people of Saxony too"". ""The valuables housed in the Green Vault and Residenzschloss were acquired by people in the Saxony Free State with difficulty, over many centuries."" He said the collection was an integral part of Saxony's history.

"Amanda White said she wants to warn others about the potential dangers of surgery abroad A 29-year-old Belfast woman had to have her left breast removed after contracting an infection following breast reduction surgery in Turkey. Amanda White travelled to a clinic in the country on 6 November, but when she returned she became ill and had to have surgery at the Ulster Hospital. Despite doctors' efforts to save her breast, she had to have a mastectomy. Ms White has spoken out because she wants to warn others of the potential dangers of having surgery abroad. The mother of two young boys, who lives in south Belfast, spoke to BBC News NI from her hospital bed. ""I had always wanted surgery from I was about 18,"" she said. ""My chest made me very uncomfortable and I had severe back pain but I had no idea it would turn out like this. ""The doctor told me if I'd left it any later before getting treatment I wouldn't be here."" Amanda White has been recovering in the Ulster Hospital Ms White said alarm bells began to ring as soon as she arrived at the clinic in Turkey. ""They just wanted my passport and cash,"" she said. ""I had to sign a consent form which wasn't in English and the surgeon was only in the room for a few seconds."" A few hours after surgery, she was taken to a villa where she stayed for three nights in a sparsely-furnished room with no windows. ""The beds weren't changed and when I asked for the corset they gave me to wear to be washed, it came back and it was still stained,"" Ms White said. She is far from alone. The Ulster Hospital has recently treated six other patients who travelled to foreign countries for their operations with terrible consequences. Alastair Brown, a consultant plastic surgeon at the Ulster Hospital, said there had been a worrying increase in what he described as cosmetic surgery tourism. Alastair Brown said the NHS is dealing with ""disastrous consequences"" in some cases ""To me it's just ludicrous. I don't know why someone would subject their body to that sort of thing, I just can't understand it,"" he said. ""I can understand them trying to save a little bit of money and the cost saving, but really over the long term, is that cost saving? ""If it goes well then brilliant and some of the cases do go well, but when it goes wrong it goes very wrong and that's where we're just seeing these disastrous consequences. ""And we cannot emphasise enough the importance of getting this message across to the public - please be very, very careful before subjecting yourself to this."" Ms White did her research before going abroad and said she was heavily influenced by a number of celebrities who said they had used the same clinic. ""All the celebrities are saying 'this place is great' and you trust that,"" she said. The surgery would have cost about Â£7,000 in Northern Ireland but Ms White spent Â£3,250 to have the operation in Turkey and that included flights and the extra cost of hotels. When she came home the wound on her left side became infected and when she went to her doctor she was told to go to the emergency department. Then, last Wednesday, she had to have more surgery. ""When they opened me up they realised they had to remove my nipple and then had to remove most of my left breast, there was nothing they could do."" Ms White told reporter Tara Mills that celebrity endorsements had influenced her choice of clinic She will be able to have reconstruction surgery in about nine months. ""The doctors here have been amazing but it's not okay to go away and I think we have to let girls know - don't go away, save the extra couple of pound and get it done at home."" Mr Brown also wants the public to be aware of the dangers. ""Think about the establishment and the aftercare,"" he said. ""Anybody can get complications but what is in place if something does go wrong? ""Our surgeons are highly skilled and trained and have ongoing assessment. Does that happen in other countries?  We just don't know. ""We had another case today but from what I'm told it wasn't so severe but it will require a lengthy period of care in the NHS."" BBC News NI contacted the Comfort Zone Surgery in Turkey where Amanda had the operation. In a statement, they said: ""As with any surgical procedure, the biggest risk is infection and this can happen to anyone in any country. ""We are obviously very sad to hear this and are more than happy to make any free corrections that she may need in the short near future.""

"Allan Hyrons and his wife, Wilma, were captured from a beach resort by four armed men last month A British businessman and his Filipino wife have been rescued from their abductors in the southern Philippines, the country's army has said. Allan and Wilma Hyrons were taken from a beach resort on Mindanao island by four armed men on 4 October. Their kidnappers - thought to belong to the IS-loyal militant group Abu Sayaff - fled after a gun battle in the nearby Sulu region on Sunday. UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the couple were ""safe and well"". Mr Hyrons, 70, who is a dual national, has lived in Mindanao's Zamboanga del Sur region with his wife since 2013. The Hyrons were taken to a military base in Sulu after they were rescued On the day they were captured, the couple had reportedly been celebrating Teachers' Day at a nearby college. Witnesses reported seeing them being taken from a hut and dragged to a motorboat. They were given medical checks after their ordeal ended with the operation by Philippine forces at approximately 17:00 GMT on Sunday. BBC News has been told that the UK military was involved in the rescue operation. A small team of British special forces personnel provided advice and planning support to help the search, a military source told BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale. The MoD has not commented. Ch Lt Gen Cirilito Sobejana (seen here with the couple) told AFP that soldiers ""overwhelmed"" the kidnappers Mr Raab thanked the Philippine authorities' ""tremendous efforts"". ""We are in particular grateful to their armed forces for their courage throughout a difficult operation which resulted in Alan and Wilma's release,"" he said. ""Foreign Office officials have been in close contact with Alan and Wilma's family throughout this ordeal. We request their privacy during this emotional time."" British Ambassador to the Philippines Daniel Pruce has spoken to the couple by telephone since their release, the Foreign Office said. He tweeted: ""Fantastic news! My sincerest thanks to all involved."" Abu Sayyaf is one of several groups in the Philippines to have pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group Abu Sayyaf is one of the smallest and most violent jihadist groups in the southern Philippines. Its name means ""bearer of the sword"" and it is notorious for kidnapping for ransom, and for attacks on civilians and the army. The group is believed to have an estimated 400 members and, since 2014, several of its factions have declared their allegiance to the so-called Islamic State (IS). In 2016, Isnilon Tontoni Hapilon, one of Abu Sayyaf's most prominent leaders, was recognised as the leader of all IS-aligned groups in the Philippines. Read the full story The UK government advises Britons against all travel to the area where Mr Hyrons was taken. BBC Philippines correspondent Howard Johnson says the island has ""several militant groups"" operating on it. In May, a 59-year-old Dutch hostage was reportedly killed by his captors on the nearby island of Jolo in May. The Philippine army said Ewold Horn, who had been kidnapped in 2012, wasshot as his captors fled a confrontation with troops. Who are the Abu Sayyaf group?

"This video can not be played Blue Story is the tale of two friends who become rivals A second cinema chain has pulled the gang-themed film Blue Story after seven police officers were injured during a brawl at an entertainment complex. It comes after youths, some armed with machetes, sparked a police operation at the Star City multiplex in Birmingham. Vue has banned the film from its 91 UK and Ireland venues and Showcase has also dropped the movie. The move has prompted a backlash on social media with somelabelling the ban as ""racist"". Five teenagers including a girl, 13, were arrested in connection with the disturbance, which involved up to 100 young people in a public area of the multiplex, on Saturday night. In a statement, Vue said the film opened in 60 of its sites across the UK and Ireland on Friday. ""But during the first 24 hours of the film over 25 significant incidents were reported and escalated to senior management in 16 separate cinemas,"" it said. ""This is the biggest number we have ever seen for any film in a such a short time frame."" A spokeswoman for Vue confirmed police had been called to some of the incidents, but could not confirm exactly how many times. The Odeon chain says it is not withdrawing the film, but ""a number of security measures are in place"" for Blue Story screenings, though it refused to elaborate on what they are. In Birmingham, a note on the door of the Odeon cinema at the Broadway Plaza said staff would be carrying out bag searches throughout the day. The film's writer and director says it is about love not violence Blue Story's writer and director, Andrew Onwubolu, said Saturday's disturbance in Birmingham was ""truly unfortunate"". In an Instagram post on Sunday, the rapper-turned-filmmaker wrote: ""Sending love to all those involved in yesterday's violence at Star City in Birmingham. ""It's truly unfortunate that a small group of people can ruin things for everybody. ""Blue Story is a film about love not violence. ""I hope that the blame is placed with the individuals and not an indictment of the film itself. ""I pray that we can all learn to live with love and treat each other with tolerance and respect."" An online petition has been launched calling for the film to be reinstated at Vue cinemas. It attracted more than 6,700 signatures in 18 hours. The film was released last Friday The Vue chain has stressed the decision to pull the film was prompted only because of the risk of further violence. ""This decision is not, as some have alleged, based on biased assumptions or concern about the content of the film itself,"" it said. On Saturday, West Midlands Police officers drew Tasers and used a dispersal order to clear the Star City venue. Footage from inside the multiplex appeared to show fights and people on the floor screaming. This video can not be played Andrew Onwubolu, known as Rapman, wrote and directed the film The five teenagers - two girls aged 13 and 14 and three 14-year-old boys - have all now been bailed alongside a 19-year-old man. Four were held on suspicion of assaulting police and one of the boys was detained on suspicion of obstructing police. A group of youths, one of whom was carrying a machete, were caught on camera Another of the boys was arrested on suspicion of violent disorder after an image circulated on social media showing a number of youths, with one carrying a machete. West Midlands police and crime commissioner David Jamieson said the unrest was ""very worrying and very disturbing"". ""Some of these children were so young,"" he said. ""I think parents have a role if they see those sorts of [weapons] in the home, to discipline their own children."" The teenagers' bail conditions ban them from leaving home at night, as well as from Star City and any cinema in the UK, police said. This video can not be played Witness Rachael Allison was at the Birmingham Star City complex when a brawl broke out Announcing it was following Vue in cancelling all screenings, Showcase said: ""Due to the recent incidents tied to screenings of the film Blue Story, after careful consideration with the film's distributor, Showcase Cinemas has immediately removed the film from all of our participating cinemas. ""Any guests that have purchased tickets in advance can receive a full refund at the cinema box office. We remain in discussions with the distributor with regards to the possibility of reintroducing the film in due course. ""We apologise for any inconvenience but guest safety remains our top priority."" Blue Story, which was developed from a YouTube mini-series, follows the life of Timmy who lives in Lewisham but goes to school in Peckham - two parts of south-east London that have a notorious rivalry. ""That part of it was based on my life - it made my school experience very difficult,""director Onwubolu told Radio 1 Newsbeat. He said he wanted the audience to see past crime statistics and headlines about knife crime, to understand how a ""good kid"" can lose their way. ""They didn't come from child abuse or neglectful mothers. What kids go through in the school playground is so intense, it all starts there."" The film was developed from a YouTube mini-series BBC Films, which developed and co-financed the film, said it was an ""outstanding, critically acclaimed debut feature which powerfully depicts the futility of gang violence"". ""It's an important film from one of the UK's most exciting new filmmakers which we're proud to be part of,"" it added. Distributor Paramount Pictures said it was ""saddened"" by events at Star City but said the movie had had an ""incredibly positive reaction and fantastic reviews"". However, Errol Lawson, a reformed gangster from Birmingham, said the film was ""stirring up"" violence. ""The spirit behind it is stirring up this undercurrent, or supporting or fuelling this undercurrent, this narrative of violence, youth violence and disregard for life,"" he said. West Midlands Police has not asked for or recommended the film be pulled following Saturday's violence. Ch Supt Steve Graham said: ""I understand there is a lot of speculation on social media and people are citing that film. ""At this stage we are not jumping to any conclusions. That will form part of our investigations as it carries on."" 'Institutionally racist': Blue Story ban faces backlash Rapman: 'When I was at school, I focused on surviving' Girl, 13, among 'machete' brawl cinema arrests Police were called to the complex, in Nechells, at about 17:30 GMT and cleared the area by 21:00. The officers hurt during the disorder suffered minor facial injuries. Supt Ian Green said: ""This was a major outbreak of trouble which left families who were just trying to enjoy a night out at the cinema understandably frightened. ""We worked quickly to move the crowds on, but were met with a very hostile response and officers had to draw Tasers to restore order. ""It's clear that some of those who went to Star City were intent on causing trouble."" In Sheffield on Sunday evening, there was an increased police presence around Centertainment on Broughton Lane ahead of the showing of the film after disorder was reported outside the Cineworld within the complex on Saturday. ""Officers carried out patrols of the area to ensure everyone's safety,"" police said in a statement, adding that they would ""be liaising with Cineworld over the coming week to discuss further screenings of this film"". Cineworld has confirmed that it will not be pulling the film.

"Nicola Sturgeon said that, based on talks she had already had, she believes that if Scotland achieved independence, it could re-enter the EU relatively quickly The SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon was the first party leader interviewed in a series of prime-time BBC One interviews by Andrew Neil Boris Johnson spent the day in Wales, campaigning - and shearing sheep - at the Royal Welsh Winter Fair Labour promised to introduce annual property ""MOT"" for private tenants in England Jeremy Corbyn also insisted his Â£58bn pledge to compensate the Waspi women was ""a moral debt we owe"" Nicky Morgan insisted Tory pledges on social care do amount to ""a clear plan"" despite criticism Lib Dems talked defence and international aid - and attacked Boris Johnson's ties with Donald Trump Former Prime Minister Tony Blair accuses both Labour and the Conservatives of offering ""fantasies"" in their general election manifestos Joseph Lee and John Hand Set your alarm for tomorrow - there's plenty more election news heading our way. Here's some of the things to expect: What's happened today? We're wrapping things up for the night, so here's a quick look back at some of the main events today: The politician formerly known as Lord Buckethead is pictured second from the right in this election count line-up Before we round up the serious headlines of the day, here's one manifesto launch you might have missed. Count Binface previously drew international attention when he stood as Lord Buckethead against Theresa May in 2017, but he has since beenforced into a rebrand because of a copyright dispute,external. Now, standing for election under his new name, he's unveiled his30-point plan for the nation,external, including policies such as making Craig Charles the official BBC commentator for all state occasions and closing down shops that play Christmas music before December. His policy on Brexit is that there should be a referendum, but only to allow voters to decide whether they want another referendum. Allow Twitter content?

As the Labour Party mentioned in its response to the Chief Rabbi, it is launching a manifesto on race and faith issues tomorrow. We have already been told that the party will set out policies on combatting anti-Semitism and it will also detail how children should be taught in schools about what the British Empire did to the rest of the world back in the days when Britain was truly a colonial superpower. The plans include creating an ""emancipation educational trust"" to ensure ""historical injustice, colonialism and role of the British empire is taught in the national curriculum"". It also says it wants new measures to tackle racial pay gaps and a race equality unit within the Treasury to examine the impact of policies on BAME communities. Read the full story Martin BashirBBC News This is a sweeping and unequivocal condemnation of Labour's leadership, its treatment of Jewish parliamentarians and its handling of allegations of anti-Semitism. It's also highly unusual for such an intervention by the leader of a religious denomination during a general election campaign. The Chief Rabbi has pastoral oversight of half the population of those who identify as Jewish in the United Kingdom. Last week. the Archbishops of Canterbury and York appealed to voters and politicians to ""honour the truth"" and ""challenge falsehoods"" but there was no specific criticism of individual candidates nor their party leaders. But the Chief Rabbi's article, to be published in the Times newspaper on Tuesday, asks if Jeremy Corbyn is fit for high office and calls on voters to consider what the result of this election ""will say about the moral compass of this country?"" Last year, three Jewish newspapers - The Jewish Chronicle, The Jewish News and The Jewish Telegraph - published exactly the same front cover on 25th July 2018 - arguing that a Labour government under the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn would prove ""an existential threat"" to British Jewry. The Chief Rabbi, in this highly critical column, is saying much the same. ""Jeremy Corbyn is a lifelong campaigner against anti-Semitism and has made absolutely clear it has no place in our party and society and that no-one who engages in it does so in his name,"" a Labour spokesman says. ""A Labour government will guarantee the security of the Jewish community, defend and support the Jewish way of life, and combat rising anti-Semitism in our country and across Europe. Our race and faith manifesto [which will be launched tomorrow], sets out our policies to achieve this."" The Chief Rabbi says it is a ""mendacious fiction"" that Labour has investigated all outstanding cases of anti-Semitism, claiming that at least 130 cases before the party are outstanding and ""thousands"" were reported but remain unresolved. But Labour says: ""The 130 figure is inaccurate and it is categorically untrue to suggest there are thousands of outstanding cases. We are taking robust action to root out anti-Semitism in the party, with swift suspensions, processes for rapid expulsions and an education programme for members."" Morte on that opinion piece from the Chief Rabbi. Ephraim Mirvis,writing in the Times,external, says that the ""Jewish community has watched with incredulity as supporters of the Labour leadership have hounded parliamentarians, members and even staff out of the party for challenging anti-Jewish racism"". He says: ""The way in which the leadership has dealt with anti-Jewish racism is incompatible with the British values of which we are so proud - of dignity and respect for all people. It has left many decent Labour members both Jewish and non-Jewish, ashamed of what has transpired."" He says it is not his place to tell people how to vote but asks what the election will say about the UK's ""moral compass"". ""When December 12 arrives, I ask every person to vote with their conscience. Be in no doubt, the very soul of our nation is at stake,"" he says. The Chief Rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, criticises the Labour Party, writing in the Times that it is not doing enough to root out anti-Semitism. He asks people to vote with their conscience in the forthcoming general election. ""Prime Ditherer"" - used as an insult towards Jeremy Corbyn and his neutral stance on Brexit - has been the Tories' attack slogan of the day. It was unveiled on a Conservative election poster (with a picture of Jeremy Corbyn) by Culture Secretary Nicky Morgan this morning. Health Secretary Matt Hancock later used the words in an interview, saying: ""So Jeremy Corbyn is the prime ditherer as demonstrated by his position, his various positions on Brexit, and his lack of a position now."" And then Boris Johnson later said of Mr Corbyn: ""He doesn't want to be prime minister, he wants to be prime ditherer. He used to be indecisive, now he's not so sure."" Nicky Morgan claimed it was Conservative Central HQ who came up with the phrase. But look at this tweet from 2016,  and the accompanying Sunday Mirror column, and it does seem that Labour's John Prescott was the one who coined the phrase - about then-PM Theresa May.

Much of the reaction online following the interview of SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon is praise for the ""forensic"" questioning, which they said put the Scottish First Minister under pressure. Some viewers thought that Andrew Neil ""out-questioned and out-answered"" his interviewee, but a Sturgeon supporter says she was honest, articulate and had a firm command of the facts. Several posters on social media speculate how other party leaders will fare under a similar grilling. You can find out how Jeremy Corbyn gets on tomorrow at 7pm on BBC One. Allow Twitter content?

That's all from Nicola Sturgeon speaking to Andrew Neil.You can watch the full interview here. Finally, Ms Sturgeon - a former health minister - is challenged on the performance of Scotland's NHS under the SNP. Mr Neil says Scotland is failing to meet its target for the number of patients treated within 12 weeks, at only 72%. ""Itâs not good enough,"" Ms Sturgeon says. But she says they are taking steps to address it with an Â£850m plan. Mr Neil brings up ""children dying in a Glasgow hospital because the water is contaminated"", Scotland's drug problem and a new Edinburgh hospital which has not opened after nine years. Ms Sturgeon says she is increasing investment in drug services and there are inquiries into the other issues. ""Yes, we have challenges in Scotland but we are dealing with
these challenges more effectively than the rest of the UK,"" she says. Mr Neil quotes an assessment by the Institute for Fiscal Studies which says that independence would require another decade of ""restraint on public spending"", saying that austerity would continue. But Ms Sturgeon says she doesn't accept that assessment. She says if the growth commission's recommendations had been followed over the last ten years, Scotland would have escaped austerity. The SNP has warned that trade friction caused by Brexit
could mean 80,000 jobs lost in Scotland. Mr Neil asks, why wonât trade friction
with the rest of the UK harm the economy after independence? The SNP leader says we âdonât yet know the final
relationship with EUâ and adds that itâs not independence that causes the trade friction, ""itâs Brexit"". She says it's in Scotland's interests to remain in the EU, a much larger market, and draws a comparison with Ireland's success in increasing exports. Challenged on how quickly Scotland could rejoin the EU if Brexit
goes ahead and the country votes for independence, Ms Sturgeon says she is ânot
going to give a specific timescaleâ but it âcould be relatively quickâ. But Mr Neil says Scotlandâs Growth Commission says it could be
five or ten years, as the country would need to establish its own currency. Ms Sturgeon says she is âabsolutely certainâ that an independent
currency would not be a requirement. âWe would have a discussion with the EU
about the journey"" Scotland was on in terms of an independent currency, she
says. Mr Neil says Scotland would also be required to build
substantial reserves in its new currency and asks how it can do that with the
largest deficit in Europe. Ms Sturgeon says Scotland is reducing its deficit faster than
expected. âOur task is to get our deficit reducing faster. That is principally
through growing our economy faster, which remaining in the EU or returning to the
EU helps us to do,â she says. This video can not be played General election 2019: Independent Scotland joining EU? Mr Neil turns his questions to the practicalities of
securing a Scottish independence referendum and establishing Scotland as a
separate state. Ms Sturgeon previously said Brexit was a âmaterial changeâ that
justified asking the Scottish people about independence again. But Mr Neil
asks, if she blocks Brexit, doesnât that justification disappear? Ms Sturgeon says: âThe material change is the way in which
Scotland has had it completely demonstrated to it over the last three years
that our views and our voice doesnât matter.â She adds that âour future path as a country is not in our
hands, itâs in the hands of Westminster politicians like Boris Johnson with his
strings being pulled by Nigel Farageâ. The other requirement for another referendum was for âclear
and sustainedâ support for independence in opinion polls, says Mr Neil. He says
that hasnât been met either. âAlmost all opinion polls show increasing support for
independence. They show increasing support for a second referendum,â she says. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.9339569
"Boris Johnson appeared in a special edition of Question Time on Friday The BBC has said editing footage of Prime Minister Boris Johnson for a news bulletin was ""a mistake on our part"". The Prime Minister appeared on Question Time: Leaders Special on BBC One on Friday evening. The audience laughed when he was asked a question about how important it is for people in power to tell the truth. But the laughter and subsequent applause was absent from a cut-down version of the exchange on a lunchtime news bulletin the following day. ""This clip from the BBC's Question Time special, which was played out in full on the News at Ten on Friday evening and on other outlets, was shortened for timing reasons on Saturday's lunchtime bulletin, to edit out a repetitious phrase from Boris Johnson,"" the BBC said in a statement. ""However, in doing so we also edited out laughter from the audience. Although there was absolutely no intention to mislead, we accept this was a mistake on our part, as it didn't reflect the full reaction to Boris Johnson's answer. ""We did not alter the soundtrack or image in any way apart from this edit, contrary to some claims on social media."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

On the original programme, an audience member asked the prime minister: ""How important is it for someone in your position of power to always tell the truth?"" There was laughter and applause from the audience as Mr Johnson answered: ""I think it's absolutely vital."" Mr Johnson then repeated the sentence once the laughter and applause had died down. The second version was the one used in the BBC's News at One bulletin on Saturday. The BBC originally explained that the Saturday edit was ""shortened for time reasons"" in reply to a tweet later the same day, although did not acknowledge it was a mistake at that point.

UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the couple were ""safe and well"". Mr Hyrons, 70, who is a dual national, has lived in Mindanao's Zamboanga del Sur region with his wife since 2013. The Hyrons were taken to a military base in Sulu after they were rescued On the day they were captured, the couple had reportedly been celebrating Teachers' Day at a nearby college. Witnesses reported seeing them being taken from a hut and dragged to a motorboat. They were given medical checks after their ordeal ended with the operation by Philippine forces at approximately 17:00 GMT on Sunday. BBC News has been told that the UK military was involved in the rescue operation.

"This video can not be played Security camera footage showed figures with torches and tools smashing one of the cabinets Burglars have stolen three diamond jewellery sets from one of Europe's largest treasure collections - the Dresden Green Vault in eastern Germany. The historic sets consist of 37 parts each, and there are fears the thieves may try to break them up. Officials are still trying to establish exactly how much was stolen in the break-in early on Monday. Saxony's ruler, Augustus the Strong, created the collection in 1723 in what is one of the world's oldest museums. ""Three out of 10 diamond sets have gone,"" said Marion Ackermann, head of the Dresden state museums. Jewellery thefts that shocked the world Jewels seized in armed raid on luxury Paris hotel The stolen sets from the Green Vault (GrÃ¼nes GewÃ¶lbe) are reported to also include some rubies, emeralds and sapphires. The thieves - still on the run - removed part of an iron grille on a ground-floor window, then smashed the glass. The Green Vault is a world-famous treasure collection At about 05:00 (04:00 GMT) on Monday, firefighters were called to tackle a blaze in a nearby electricity junction box. There is speculation that the fire disabled the museum's alarm system. It put out some of the street lights. Police are examining CCTV footage which shows two suspects in the dark. But more people may have been involved in the robbery. A car found burning in Dresden early on Monday may have been the getaway vehicle used by the burglars, police say. Giant gold coin trial opens in Berlin The museum had guards on duty at night, Ms Ackermann said. Dozens of police cars are at the scene and the Green Vault in central Dresden is now shut. ""Three out of 10 diamond sets have gone,"" said Ms Ackermann. However, Dresden police and museum officials did not provide any further details. Ms Ackermann described them as ""priceless - we can't put a figure on it"". ""The items cannot be sold on the art market legally - they're too well known,"" she said. The baroque palace was hit in World War Two air raids, but Dresden restored it Ms Ackermann stressed that the cultural value of the unique collection was far greater than its material value. The popular German daily Bild saidthe thieves had grabbed jewels,externalworth â¬1bn (Â£855m). The collection is housed in eight ornate rooms in the Residenzschloss - a former royal palace. Three rooms were destroyed by Allied bombing in World War Two, but after the war, the museum was restored to its previous glory. It is called the Green Vault because some rooms were decorated with malachite-green paint. The Green Vault houses treasured items such as this 16th-Century Indian mother-of-pearl box The most valuable items are in the palace's historic section on the ground floor. There are about 3,000 items of jewellery and other treasures decorated with gold, silver, ivory and pearl. They include a figure of a moor studded with emeralds and a 648-carat sapphire - a royal gift from Russia's Tsar Peter the Great. One of the most valuable jewels is a 41-carat green diamond currently on show in New York. The collection was founded by Augustus the Strong. He was Elector of Saxony (a German prince entitled to take part in the election of the emperor) and later king of Poland. Saxony's minister-president, Michael Kretschmer, voiced outrage at the crime, saying ""not only were the state art collections burgled, but the people of Saxony too"". ""The valuables housed in the Green Vault and Residenzschloss were acquired by people in the Saxony Free State with difficulty, over many centuries."" He said the collection was an integral part of Saxony's history.

"A helicopter and lifeboats searched for the missing aircraft The search for a missing light aircraft and its pilot off the Welsh coast has been suspended for the night, the coastguard said. North Wales Police said the plane had been flying from Caernarfon Airport to the Great Orme, Llandudno and back on Monday afternoon when it disappeared. The force added that there were no other passengers, and officers were supporting the missing pilot's family. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency said the search would resume on Tuesday. A coastguard helicopter and the RNLI searched an area around Puffin Island, near Penmon, Anglesey for the aircraft on Monday. A flight which travelled from Caernarfon towards Llandudno on Monday appeared to disappear from the radar HM Coastguard said it received a call for assistance shortly before 12:50 GMT. A spokesperson said the search was launched after a report that an aircraft had disappeared from radar contact. Lifeboats from Beaumaris, Moelfre and Llandudno, and North Wales Police all took part. North Wales Police said: ""We received a call at 12:59 reporting a possible crash involving a light aircraft in the Penmon area. ""Officers are currently assisting HM Coastguard and our enquiries are ongoing."" The Air Accidents Investigation Branch also said it had sent a team to investigate an accident involving a light aircraft near Beaumaris, Anglesey.

"Nicola Sturgeon said that, based on talks she had already had, she believes that if Scotland achieved independence, it could re-enter the EU relatively quickly The SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon was the first party leader interviewed in a series of prime-time BBC One interviews by Andrew Neil Boris Johnson spent the day in Wales, campaigning - and shearing sheep - at the Royal Welsh Winter Fair Labour promised to introduce annual property ""MOT"" for private tenants in England Jeremy Corbyn also insisted his Â£58bn pledge to compensate the Waspi women was ""a moral debt we owe"" Nicky Morgan insisted Tory pledges on social care do amount to ""a clear plan"" despite criticism Lib Dems talked defence and international aid - and attacked Boris Johnson's ties with Donald Trump Former Prime Minister Tony Blair accuses both Labour and the Conservatives of offering ""fantasies"" in their general election manifestos Joseph Lee and John Hand Set your alarm for tomorrow - there's plenty more election news heading our way. Here's some of the things to expect: What's happened today? We're wrapping things up for the night, so here's a quick look back at some of the main events today: The politician formerly known as Lord Buckethead is pictured second from the right in this election count line-up Before we round up the serious headlines of the day, here's one manifesto launch you might have missed. Count Binface previously drew international attention when he stood as Lord Buckethead against Theresa May in 2017, but he has since beenforced into a rebrand because of a copyright dispute,external. Now, standing for election under his new name, he's unveiled his30-point plan for the nation,external, including policies such as making Craig Charles the official BBC commentator for all state occasions and closing down shops that play Christmas music before December. His policy on Brexit is that there should be a referendum, but only to allow voters to decide whether they want another referendum. Allow Twitter content?

As the Labour Party mentioned in its response to the Chief Rabbi, it is launching a manifesto on race and faith issues tomorrow. We have already been told that the party will set out policies on combatting anti-Semitism and it will also detail how children should be taught in schools about what the British Empire did to the rest of the world back in the days when Britain was truly a colonial superpower. The plans include creating an ""emancipation educational trust"" to ensure ""historical injustice, colonialism and role of the British empire is taught in the national curriculum"". It also says it wants new measures to tackle racial pay gaps and a race equality unit within the Treasury to examine the impact of policies on BAME communities. Read the full story Martin BashirBBC News This is a sweeping and unequivocal condemnation of Labour's leadership, its treatment of Jewish parliamentarians and its handling of allegations of anti-Semitism. It's also highly unusual for such an intervention by the leader of a religious denomination during a general election campaign. The Chief Rabbi has pastoral oversight of half the population of those who identify as Jewish in the United Kingdom. Last week. the Archbishops of Canterbury and York appealed to voters and politicians to ""honour the truth"" and ""challenge falsehoods"" but there was no specific criticism of individual candidates nor their party leaders. But the Chief Rabbi's article, to be published in the Times newspaper on Tuesday, asks if Jeremy Corbyn is fit for high office and calls on voters to consider what the result of this election ""will say about the moral compass of this country?"" Last year, three Jewish newspapers - The Jewish Chronicle, The Jewish News and The Jewish Telegraph - published exactly the same front cover on 25th July 2018 - arguing that a Labour government under the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn would prove ""an existential threat"" to British Jewry. The Chief Rabbi, in this highly critical column, is saying much the same. ""Jeremy Corbyn is a lifelong campaigner against anti-Semitism and has made absolutely clear it has no place in our party and society and that no-one who engages in it does so in his name,"" a Labour spokesman says. ""A Labour government will guarantee the security of the Jewish community, defend and support the Jewish way of life, and combat rising anti-Semitism in our country and across Europe. Our race and faith manifesto [which will be launched tomorrow], sets out our policies to achieve this."" The Chief Rabbi says it is a ""mendacious fiction"" that Labour has investigated all outstanding cases of anti-Semitism, claiming that at least 130 cases before the party are outstanding and ""thousands"" were reported but remain unresolved. But Labour says: ""The 130 figure is inaccurate and it is categorically untrue to suggest there are thousands of outstanding cases. We are taking robust action to root out anti-Semitism in the party, with swift suspensions, processes for rapid expulsions and an education programme for members."" Morte on that opinion piece from the Chief Rabbi. Ephraim Mirvis,writing in the Times,external, says that the ""Jewish community has watched with incredulity as supporters of the Labour leadership have hounded parliamentarians, members and even staff out of the party for challenging anti-Jewish racism"". He says: ""The way in which the leadership has dealt with anti-Jewish racism is incompatible with the British values of which we are so proud - of dignity and respect for all people. It has left many decent Labour members both Jewish and non-Jewish, ashamed of what has transpired."" He says it is not his place to tell people how to vote but asks what the election will say about the UK's ""moral compass"". ""When December 12 arrives, I ask every person to vote with their conscience. Be in no doubt, the very soul of our nation is at stake,"" he says. The Chief Rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, criticises the Labour Party, writing in the Times that it is not doing enough to root out anti-Semitism. He asks people to vote with their conscience in the forthcoming general election. ""Prime Ditherer"" - used as an insult towards Jeremy Corbyn and his neutral stance on Brexit - has been the Tories' attack slogan of the day. It was unveiled on a Conservative election poster (with a picture of Jeremy Corbyn) by Culture Secretary Nicky Morgan this morning. Health Secretary Matt Hancock later used the words in an interview, saying: ""So Jeremy Corbyn is the prime ditherer as demonstrated by his position, his various positions on Brexit, and his lack of a position now."" And then Boris Johnson later said of Mr Corbyn: ""He doesn't want to be prime minister, he wants to be prime ditherer. He used to be indecisive, now he's not so sure."" Nicky Morgan claimed it was Conservative Central HQ who came up with the phrase. But look at this tweet from 2016,  and the accompanying Sunday Mirror column, and it does seem that Labour's John Prescott was the one who coined the phrase - about then-PM Theresa May.

Much of the reaction online following the interview of SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon is praise for the ""forensic"" questioning, which they said put the Scottish First Minister under pressure. Some viewers thought that Andrew Neil ""out-questioned and out-answered"" his interviewee, but a Sturgeon supporter says she was honest, articulate and had a firm command of the facts. Several posters on social media speculate how other party leaders will fare under a similar grilling. You can find out how Jeremy Corbyn gets on tomorrow at 7pm on BBC One. Allow Twitter content?

That's all from Nicola Sturgeon speaking to Andrew Neil.You can watch the full interview here. Finally, Ms Sturgeon - a former health minister - is challenged on the performance of Scotland's NHS under the SNP. Mr Neil says Scotland is failing to meet its target for the number of patients treated within 12 weeks, at only 72%. ""Itâs not good enough,"" Ms Sturgeon says. But she says they are taking steps to address it with an Â£850m plan. Mr Neil brings up ""children dying in a Glasgow hospital because the water is contaminated"", Scotland's drug problem and a new Edinburgh hospital which has not opened after nine years. Ms Sturgeon says she is increasing investment in drug services and there are inquiries into the other issues. ""Yes, we have challenges in Scotland but we are dealing with
these challenges more effectively than the rest of the UK,"" she says. Mr Neil quotes an assessment by the Institute for Fiscal Studies which says that independence would require another decade of ""restraint on public spending"", saying that austerity would continue. But Ms Sturgeon says she doesn't accept that assessment. She says if the growth commission's recommendations had been followed over the last ten years, Scotland would have escaped austerity. The SNP has warned that trade friction caused by Brexit
could mean 80,000 jobs lost in Scotland. Mr Neil asks, why wonât trade friction
with the rest of the UK harm the economy after independence? The SNP leader says we âdonât yet know the final
relationship with EUâ and adds that itâs not independence that causes the trade friction, ""itâs Brexit"". She says it's in Scotland's interests to remain in the EU, a much larger market, and draws a comparison with Ireland's success in increasing exports. Challenged on how quickly Scotland could rejoin the EU if Brexit
goes ahead and the country votes for independence, Ms Sturgeon says she is ânot
going to give a specific timescaleâ but it âcould be relatively quickâ. But Mr Neil says Scotlandâs Growth Commission says it could be
five or ten years, as the country would need to establish its own currency. Ms Sturgeon says she is âabsolutely certainâ that an independent
currency would not be a requirement. âWe would have a discussion with the EU
about the journey"" Scotland was on in terms of an independent currency, she
says. Mr Neil says Scotland would also be required to build
substantial reserves in its new currency and asks how it can do that with the
largest deficit in Europe. Ms Sturgeon says Scotland is reducing its deficit faster than
expected. âOur task is to get our deficit reducing faster. That is principally
through growing our economy faster, which remaining in the EU or returning to the
EU helps us to do,â she says. This video can not be played General election 2019: Independent Scotland joining EU? Mr Neil turns his questions to the practicalities of
securing a Scottish independence referendum and establishing Scotland as a
separate state. Ms Sturgeon previously said Brexit was a âmaterial changeâ that
justified asking the Scottish people about independence again. But Mr Neil
asks, if she blocks Brexit, doesnât that justification disappear? Ms Sturgeon says: âThe material change is the way in which
Scotland has had it completely demonstrated to it over the last three years
that our views and our voice doesnât matter.â She adds that âour future path as a country is not in our
hands, itâs in the hands of Westminster politicians like Boris Johnson with his
strings being pulled by Nigel Farageâ. The other requirement for another referendum was for âclear
and sustainedâ support for independence in opinion polls, says Mr Neil. He says
that hasnât been met either. âAlmost all opinion polls show increasing support for
independence. They show increasing support for a second referendum,â she says. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.9999994
"Naomi Long launched her party's general election manifesto on Monday Alliance leader Naomi Long has said the current general election campaign is ""one of the worst"" she has ever fought in terms of ""smears and lies"". She was speaking as she helped launch her party's manifesto at a Belfast hotel. In recent weeks, banners attacking a variety of politicians and parties have appeared in North and South Belfast and in North Down. The party is standing candidates in all 18 seats in Northern Ireland. It had no MPs in the last Parliament. General Election 2019: NI candidates Mrs Long told BBC News NI: ""I think it is one of the worst elections that I have ever fought in terms of the levels of smears, the levels of lies. The levels of discrimination. ""I think it is just a fact now of the kind of culture that we see in politics where we treat people with disrespect where people are not allowed to differ and have a disagreement."" Mrs Long, who won East Belfast in 2010 but lost it in 2015, refused to be drawn on what her target was in terms of winning seats. She said: ""Of course I want to win seats and of course we are ambitious to be represented at Westminster. ""It is the only level of government where we don't have an elected representative."" The party remains confident that it can win parliamentary seats next month. Earlier this year, Mrs Long became the party's first MEP and Alliance secured gains in the local council elections. The 40-page manifesto, entitled Demand Better, examines Brexit, Stormont, governance and transparency, work and welfare and climate action. The party wants a fresh EU referendum with the option to remain in the EU. It says there should be a special deal for Northern Ireland and that the whole of the UK should remain in the single market and the customs union. ""Brexit must not become an orange and green issue,"" Mrs Long said. The Alliance leader added that her party was pro-Remain. ""Our future lies at the heart of the EU,"" she said. In relation to restoring devolution in Northern Ireland, Alliance say any future inter-party talks should be ""time-bound"" and should be chaired by an ""independent mediator"". Mrs Long said that if there is no agreement by 13 January 2020, there should be ""fresh elections"". On the issue of securing local political agreement, the Alliance leader said ""the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in must compromise"". Alliance would like to see a new civic forum made up of local politicians and citizens. The party says there should be ""full transparency of political donations"" and it would like to see proportional representation for elections to the House of Commons and a directly elected House of Lords. Alliance would also like to see 16-year-olds allowed to vote in elections. On work and welfare issues, Alliance would like to see the repeal of the bedroom tax and an overhaul of bereavement benefits.

"TSB is to close 82 branches next year as part of a plan by new chief executive Debbie Crosbie to make Â£100m of cost cuts by 2022. The Spanish-owned bank has 540 branches and is trying to restore its reputation after last year's huge IT failure, which hit 1.9 million customers. The outlets to be shut will be named on 28 November after staff have been told. TSB would not comment on job numbers, but it is thought that between 300 and 400 positions will be affected. Ms Crosbie replaced Paul Pester,who stepped down in September last yearfollowing the IT debacle that began in April 2018 when an attempt to move data to a new computer system went wrong. Last week,customers again faced problems, this time with wages and other payments being paid into their accounts. Announcing the new strategy, Ms Crosbie said: ""The plan we're sharing today involves some difficult decisions, but it sets TSB up to succeed in the future. ""Our new strategy positions TSB to succeed in a challenging environment at a time when we know customers want something different and better from their bank."" TSB lacked common sense before IT meltdown, says report Reduced opening hours announced at 93 TSB branches The bank - which was spun out of Lloyds Banking Group - will spend Â£180m closing the branches and on other restructuring costs. TSB was created in 2013 under the instruction of the European Commission after Lloyds was bailed out by UK taxpayers in 2008. It started with 631 branches, which included those that were branded Cheltenham & Gloucester as well as all Lloyds branches in Scotland. That network has already been reduced in size and it is thought that under this latest reduction the staff affected will be offered redeployment opportunities where possible. Lloyds floated TSB as a stand-alone bank on the London stock market, but it was then bought by Sabadell of Spain in 2015. As well as closing branches, Ms Crosbie said the bank would spend Â£120m on improving its digital offering and automating some of its branches. By 2022, it expects 90% of transactions to be self-service. The bank also wants to speed up the time it takes to open and start using a current account from seven days to 10 minutes. In April, TSB had already announced that 71 branches in Scotland and 22 in England would open for only two or three days a week. Dominic Hook, national officer at union Unite, urged Ms Crosbie to rethink the latest branch closures. ""With over 3,300 bank branches having closed since 2015 this TSB news will hit High Streets extremely hard,"" he said. Last year's IT failure drove the bank to a loss in 2018, although in the first half of this year it reported a profit of Â£21.1m. Ms Crosbie is aiming for profits of between Â£130m and Â£140m in 2022. The humiliation of last year's catastrophic breakdown has forced TSB to abandon grandiose promises. When it was hived off from Lloyds six years ago, it pledged to be a bank you could trust, without the ""funny stuff"" that tainted other scandal-ridden banks. It wowed people with a current account paying 5% interest. Its then chief executive, Paul Pester, attacked rivals for ""savagely cutting branches"" and made a firm commitment to his outlets, promising to expand the network. The IT failure knocked a deep dent in customer trust, and then TSB cut its flagship interest rate. And now Debbie Crosbie, the boss brought in to steady the ship, is targeting branches. It is true that the rise of the internet is forcing the industry to change. But that's the point. TSB promised it would be something different. Now we see it is just another bank.

"This video can not be played During a demo for the new Tesla 'Cybertruck', Elon Musk had an embarrassing moment Elon Musk has revealed why the windows of Tesla's Cybertruck broke during an embarrassing launch incident. He blamed the mishap on the order in which a demonstration had taken place. The vehicle was first struck with a sledgehammer in what appeared to be a successful demonstration of its armour body's strength. But this had caused an unseen crack, Mr Musk revealed,which had subsequently led to the windows smashingwhen they had been hit with a steel ball. The futuristic vehicle was unveiled on Thursday in Hawthorne, California, where its stainless steel, angular design drew a mixed response from the audience. Responding to a fan on Twitter, Mr Musk said the incident could have been easily avoided. The Cybertruck launch that didn't go quite as expected Tesla shares surge after unexpected profit ""Sledgehammer impact on door cracked the base of the glass, which is why the steel ball didn't bounce off,"" he wrote. ""Should have done steel ball on window, then sledgehammer the door. Next time."" Over the weekend, Mr Musk tweeted footage of an earlier demonstration, carried out behind the scenes moments before the launch, showing the windows withstanding the impact of the steel ball.

Despite the awkward mishap, Tesla announced it had received more than 200,000 ""orders"" for its Cybertruck following the demonstration. The firm is charging $100 to reserve the vehicle, but the sum is refundable if the customer later changes their mind. The success of the launch event has caused some speculation on social media the incident, viewed millions of times online, had been orchestrated to go viral. ""It's hard to say if that one infamous moment is why Tesla has been able to get 200,000 deposits on the Cybertruck but all the extra attention certainly didn't hurt,"" said Jessica Caldwell, from vehicle marketplace Edmunds. ""Moments like that are why Tesla has such a passionate fan base: while most executives are always hyper-rehearsed and polished, Elon Musk has never been afraid to show his human side, for better or worse.

"Pro-democracy voters celebrating in Hong Kong Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam has said the government will ""seriously reflect"" after local elections saw massive gains by pro-democracy candidates. Seventeen of the 18 district councils are now controlled by pro-democracy councillors, according to local media. The election, the first since the wave of anti-Beijing protests began, saw an unprecedented turnout of more than 71%. It is being seen as a stinging rebuke of Ms Lam's leadership and a show of support for the protest movement. Hong Kong's young winners and the veterans they toppled Hong Kong has seen months of increasingly violent protests since Ms Lam tried to introduce a controversial bill enabling extradition to China. Carrie Lam has become increasingly unpopular in Hong Kong In a statement released online,externalon Monday, Ms Lam said the government respected the results. She said many felt the results reflected ""people's dissatisfaction with the current situation and the deep-seated problems in society"". The government would ""listen to the opinions of members of the public humbly and seriously reflect"", she said. Some 2.94 million people voted in the election, compared with 1.4 million in 2015. Pro-democracy candidates won close to 60% of the total vote on Sunday, but achieved a landslide in terms of seats because of the first-past-the-post system, local media report. Pro-democracy contenders were victorious in 347 of the 452 district council seats up for grabs; pro-Beijing candidates won 60 seats; while independents - many of them pro-democracy - got 45, according to the South China Morning Post. In the last election four years ago, pro-Beijing councillors won 298 seats, but the distribution of these seats meant they took control of all 18 district councils. They retained control of only the Islands District Council after Sunday's vote. The territory's district councillors have little political power and mainly deal with local issues such as bus routes and rubbish collection, so the district elections do not normally generate such interest. This video can not be played A winner and a loser in Hong Kong's historic poll result But the councillors also get to choose 117 of their number to sit on the 1,200-member committee that selects Hong Kong's chief executive, who is then formally appointed by the Chinese government.

"Pro-democracy voters celebrating in Hong Kong Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam has said the government will ""seriously reflect"" after local elections saw massive gains by pro-democracy candidates. Seventeen of the 18 district councils are now controlled by pro-democracy councillors, according to local media. The election, the first since the wave of anti-Beijing protests began, saw an unprecedented turnout of more than 71%. It is being seen as a stinging rebuke of Ms Lam's leadership and a show of support for the protest movement. Hong Kong's young winners and the veterans they toppled Hong Kong has seen months of increasingly violent protests since Ms Lam tried to introduce a controversial bill enabling extradition to China. Carrie Lam has become increasingly unpopular in Hong Kong In a statement released online,externalon Monday, Ms Lam said the government respected the results. She said many felt the results reflected ""people's dissatisfaction with the current situation and the deep-seated problems in society"". The government would ""listen to the opinions of members of the public humbly and seriously reflect"", she said. Some 2.94 million people voted in the election, compared with 1.4 million in 2015. Pro-democracy candidates won close to 60% of the total vote on Sunday, but achieved a landslide in terms of seats because of the first-past-the-post system, local media report. Pro-democracy contenders were victorious in 347 of the 452 district council seats up for grabs; pro-Beijing candidates won 60 seats; while independents - many of them pro-democracy - got 45, according to the South China Morning Post. In the last election four years ago, pro-Beijing councillors won 298 seats, but the distribution of these seats meant they took control of all 18 district councils. They retained control of only the Islands District Council after Sunday's vote. The territory's district councillors have little political power and mainly deal with local issues such as bus routes and rubbish collection, so the district elections do not normally generate such interest. This video can not be played A winner and a loser in Hong Kong's historic poll result But the councillors also get to choose 117 of their number to sit on the 1,200-member committee that selects Hong Kong's chief executive, who is then formally appointed by the Chinese government. The landslide results mean all of those 117 seats are now likely to go to pro-democracy candidates, so they will have a greater influence over that decision, which is set to be made in 2022.

"This video can not be played Security camera footage showed figures with torches and tools smashing one of the cabinets Burglars have stolen three diamond jewellery sets from one of Europe's largest treasure collections - the Dresden Green Vault in eastern Germany. The historic sets consist of 37 parts each, and there are fears the thieves may try to break them up. Officials are still trying to establish exactly how much was stolen in the break-in early on Monday. Saxony's ruler, Augustus the Strong, created the collection in 1723 in what is one of the world's oldest museums. ""Three out of 10 diamond sets have gone,"" said Marion Ackermann, head of the Dresden state museums. Jewellery thefts that shocked the world Jewels seized in armed raid on luxury Paris hotel The stolen sets from the Green Vault (GrÃ¼nes GewÃ¶lbe) are reported to also include some rubies, emeralds and sapphires. The thieves - still on the run - removed part of an iron grille on a ground-floor window, then smashed the glass. The Green Vault is a world-famous treasure collection At about 05:00 (04:00 GMT) on Monday, firefighters were called to tackle a blaze in a nearby electricity junction box. There is speculation that the fire disabled the museum's alarm system. It put out some of the street lights. Police are examining CCTV footage which shows two suspects in the dark. But more people may have been involved in the robbery. A car found burning in Dresden early on Monday may have been the getaway vehicle used by the burglars, police say. Giant gold coin trial opens in Berlin The museum had guards on duty at night, Ms Ackermann said. Dozens of police cars are at the scene and the Green Vault in central Dresden is now shut. ""Three out of 10 diamond sets have gone,"" said Ms Ackermann. However, Dresden police and museum officials did not provide any further details. Ms Ackermann described them as ""priceless - we can't put a figure on it"". ""The items cannot be sold on the art market legally - they're too well known,"" she said. The baroque palace was hit in World War Two air raids, but Dresden restored it Ms Ackermann stressed that the cultural value of the unique collection was far greater than its material value. The popular German daily Bild saidthe thieves had grabbed jewels,externalworth â¬1bn (Â£855m). The collection is housed in eight ornate rooms in the Residenzschloss - a former royal palace. Three rooms were destroyed by Allied bombing in World War Two, but after the war, the museum was restored to its previous glory. It is called the Green Vault because some rooms were decorated with malachite-green paint. The Green Vault houses treasured items such as this 16th-Century Indian mother-of-pearl box The most valuable items are in the palace's historic section on the ground floor. There are about 3,000 items of jewellery and other treasures decorated with gold, silver, ivory and pearl. They include a figure of a moor studded with emeralds and a 648-carat sapphire - a royal gift from Russia's Tsar Peter the Great. One of the most valuable jewels is a 41-carat green diamond currently on show in New York. The collection was founded by Augustus the Strong. He was Elector of Saxony (a German prince entitled to take part in the election of the emperor) and later king of Poland. Saxony's minister-president, Michael Kretschmer, voiced outrage at the crime, saying ""not only were the state art collections burgled, but the people of Saxony too"". ""The valuables housed in the Green Vault and Residenzschloss were acquired by people in the Saxony Free State with difficulty, over many centuries."" He said the collection was an integral part of Saxony's history.

"Secondary ticketing firm Viagogo has announced a $4bn (Â£3.1bn) deal to buy its rival StubHub, in a move it said would create more choice for customers. Viagogo is buying its rival from eBay, which bought StubHub in 2007 for $310m. It means Viagogo's boss Eric Baker will be reunited with StubHub, which he co-founded but left before the eBay sale. The deal comes after the UK's competition authority suspended legal action against Viagogo after it made changes to the way it operates. In September, Viagogo amended the way it presents information to customers which the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said meant the website was now ""worlds apart"" from the one that prompted the legal action. Viagogo sidesteps legal action with website fixes The CMA had asked operators such as Viagogo to improve the information they provided about tickets, such as the risk a buyer would be turned away at the door, which ticket they were getting, and the availability and popularity of tickets. In May 2018,the then Digital Minister Margot James told the BBCthat if fans had to use a secondary site to buy tickets, ""don't choose Viagogo - they are the worst"". Mr Baker, who is co-founder and chief executive of Viagogo, said that it had ""long been my wish to unite the two companies"". ""I am so proud of how StubHub has grown over the years and excited about the possibilities for our shared futures. ""Buyers will have a wider choice of tickets, and sellers will have a wider network of buyers. Bringing these two companies together creates a win-win for fans - more choice and better pricing."" StubHub has a bigger presence in the US than Viagogo, which is better known in the UK and other parts of the world. They are ""pretty perfect complementary businesses,"" Cris Miller, Viagogo's managing director, told the BBC. Viagogo says the deal will mean more choice and better prices for ticket buyers He acknowledged the controversies surrounding Viagogo - which two years ago did not turn up to a hearing with MPs -  and did not rule out StubHub becoming the preferred brand. ""The reality is we don't know quite yet,"" Mr Miller said. ""We, at Viagogo, have made a considerable amount of changes to the website, have addressed a considerable amount of the concerns that regulators have seen over the world... so it remains to be seen. Certainly we have a lot to learn from them [StubHub]."" The takeover is subject to regulatory approval. Mr Miller said he expected that ""steps would be required for us to adhere to"" and added that Viagogo would work with regulators to ensure the deal was  approved. He said the deal was good for ticket buyers as sellers had to compete on price on the website. ""The sellers are required to compete with each other, so the more sellers that are on the platform the more ticket inventory that is up there. That puts pressure on the prices and brings prices down, which is ultimately better for the customers"" Shares in eBay rose 3% after the deal was announced. It comes after the company faced pressure from activist investors - Elliott Management Corp and Starboard Value - to sell off parts of its operations, including StubHub. Scott Schenkel, interim chief executive at eBay, said the deal was a ""great outcome and maximises long-term value for eBay shareholders"".

"Naomi Long launched her party's general election manifesto on Monday Alliance leader Naomi Long has said the current general election campaign is ""one of the worst"" she has ever fought in terms of ""smears and lies"". She was speaking as she helped launch her party's manifesto at a Belfast hotel. In recent weeks, banners attacking a variety of politicians and parties have appeared in North and South Belfast and in North Down. The party is standing candidates in all 18 seats in Northern Ireland. It had no MPs in the last Parliament. General Election 2019: NI candidates Mrs Long told BBC News NI: ""I think it is one of the worst elections that I have ever fought in terms of the levels of smears, the levels of lies. The levels of discrimination. ""I think it is just a fact now of the kind of culture that we see in politics where we treat people with disrespect where people are not allowed to differ and have a disagreement."" Mrs Long, who won East Belfast in 2010 but lost it in 2015, refused to be drawn on what her target was in terms of winning seats. She said: ""Of course I want to win seats and of course we are ambitious to be represented at Westminster. ""It is the only level of government where we don't have an elected representative."" The party remains confident that it can win parliamentary seats next month. Earlier this year, Mrs Long became the party's first MEP and Alliance secured gains in the local council elections. The 40-page manifesto, entitled Demand Better, examines Brexit, Stormont, governance and transparency, work and welfare and climate action. The party wants a fresh EU referendum with the option to remain in the EU. It says there should be a special deal for Northern Ireland and that the whole of the UK should remain in the single market and the customs union. ""Brexit must not become an orange and green issue,"" Mrs Long said. The Alliance leader added that her party was pro-Remain. ""Our future lies at the heart of the EU,"" she said. In relation to restoring devolution in Northern Ireland, Alliance say any future inter-party talks should be ""time-bound"" and should be chaired by an ""independent mediator"". Mrs Long said that if there is no agreement by 13 January 2020, there should be ""fresh elections"". On the issue of securing local political agreement, the Alliance leader said ""the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in must compromise"". Alliance would like to see a new civic forum made up of local politicians and citizens. The party says there should be ""full transparency of political donations"" and it would like to see proportional representation for elections to the House of Commons and a directly elected House of Lords. Alliance would also like to see 16-year-olds allowed to vote in elections. On work and welfare issues, Alliance would like to see the repeal of the bedroom tax and an overhaul of bereavement benefits.

"Tiffany is known for its signature robin's-egg blue packaging The world's biggest luxury goods company is buying US-based jeweller Tiffany & Co for more than $16bn (Â£12.5bn). The largest luxury goods deal to date gives LVMH's billionaire owner Bernard Arnault a bigger slice of one of the fastest growing upmarket sectors. He said Tiffany had an ""unparalleled heritage"" and fitted with his other brands. Tiffany has been hit by lower spending by tourists and a strong US dollar. Tiffany is something of a New York institution and its flagship store is next to Trump Tower on 5th Avenue. The company hit global fame after being featured in the 1961 Audrey Hepburn film Breakfast at Tiffany's. Founded in 1837, it employs more than 14,000 people and operates about 300 stores - 12 of them in the UK. Mr Arnault has coveted the business since buying the Bulgari brand in 2011 for $5.2bn. The Breakfast at Tiffany's film starring Audrey Hepburn made the store famous ""We have an immense respect and admiration for Tiffany and intend to develop this jewel with the same dedication and commitment that we have applied to each and every one of our Maisons [brand houses],"" he said. LVMH has 75 brands, 156,000 employees and a network of more than 4,590 stores. Its other brands include Kenzo, Tag Heuer, Dom PÃ©rignon, Moet & Chandon, and Christian Dior. ""We will be proud to have Tiffany sit alongside our iconic brands and look forward to ensuring that Tiffany continues to thrive for centuries to come,"" Mr Arnault said. Known for its signature robin's-egg blue packaging, Tiffany rebuffed LVMH's initial advance made just five weeks ago, arguing it significantly undervalued the company. The new deal values each Tiffany share at $135 in cash and is higher than the initial offer of $120 a share - which valued the business at $14.5bn. Tiffany chairman Roger Farah said the board had concluded this deal ""provides an exciting path forward with a group that appreciates and will invest in Tiffany's unique assets and strong human capital"". Tiffany is trying to appeal to younger customers through influencers such as Kendall Jenner The brand is associated with diamond rings but it has lost its appeal in recent years, according to Fiona Cincotta, market analyst at City Index. She told the BBC's Today programme that there had been a ""changing of the times"". ""It's not quite keeping up with millennials so it just needs a re-boost and a re-brand,"" she said. LVMH has experience of revitalising businesses. Ms Cincotta cited jeweller Bulgari, which when LVMH took it over in 2011 had operating margins of 8%. These have now widened to 25% on double the sales. ""This something that LVMH appears to do very well... this is a real turnaround story,"" Ms Cincotta said. Step through the doors of the Tiffany & Co flagship store on Fifth Avenue in New York and you go back in time to the 1960s. You don't quite expect Audrey Hepburn to be gazing longingly at one of the glass display cases, but the shop's atmosphere is redolent of the eponymous film that did so much to make the jewellery chain an international name. That ready association is an asset - everyone knows what Tiffany does - but is also a weakness. Millennials don't want to shop where their parents did, which is why Tiffany has been struggling in recent years and has now given up the fight to remain an independent company. LVMH is paying a decent price - $135 a share is not far off its all-time high - but it's worth bearing in mind that luxury brands are notoriously difficult to value. Tiffany's staff will be hoping that LVMH can repeat what it did with Bulgari, turning a rather old-fashioned brand into something more cutting edge, and doubling sales in the process. Investment bankers, ever eager for the sniff of a deal, will also be wondering whether this move by LVMH might trigger a reshuffle of its sprawling empire. One obvious deal - which has been touted many times but never made it off the drawing board - would be the sale of its majority holding in Moet-Hennessy to Diageo, the drinks giant that currently owns a one-third share. Diageo would be an eager buyer, but over the years LVMH has shown itself reluctant to sell. Tiffany has attempted to broaden its appeal to younger customers. Last year, actor Elle Fanning was named as the face of the brand and fronted an advertising campaign to the strains of Moon River - the theme tune to the film Breakfast at Tiffany's - but remixed and featuring the rapper A$AP Ferg. It also secured Kendall Jenner, one of the biggest ""influencers"" on Instagram with 119 million followers, as one of the models for this year's spring and summer collection. In 2018, it brought in Reed Krakoff, widely credited for transforming the US handbag brand Coach into a multi-billion dollar business, as its chief artistic officer. One of his first collections when he joined Tiffany was called ""Everyday Objects"" and features products such as a sterling silver ball of yarn for Â£8,750 and a set of 10 Lego-like silver and walnut building blocks which cost Â£1,550. Its main focus, though, is jewellery which was one of the strongest performing areas of the luxury industry in 2018.  Consultancy Bain & Co forecast that comparable sales in the $20bn global market were expected to rise by 7% this year. This has encouraged firms to expand in the sector.  Luxury goods firm Kering has launched high-end jewellery lines for its fashion brand Gucci, while Switzerland's Richemont - a sector leader with labels such as Cartier - recently bought Italy's Buccellati.

"Labour has pledged to bring in rent controls in Englandif it wins the general election. It is an idea that has been tried in many cities worldwide, but what is rent control and how does it work? There are a number of different ways to control rent. They can include setting a cap on the amount landlords can charge, or even freezing rents. Berlin recently backed a five-year rent freeze Rent increases once a new tenancy is agreed could also be limited, and it could be made easier for people to stay on in a property. Rent controls can vary hugely in how they are implemented. For example, officials might choose to cap rent prices at the current market rate, or to set a lower limit if prices are high. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is calling for rent increases to be capped at the national inflation rate. He says areas with high rents would be able to make the case for more controls. The Conservatives have promised to ban Section 21 notices, which allow landlords to evict tenants without a reason after their fixed-term tenancy ends. The cost of renting a property has been increasing in the UK, but wages have been struggling to keep up. In London,average monthly private rents increased by 35% from Â£1,095 in 2011 to Â£1,473 in 2018.,externalMany young people in the capital are spending more than half of their income on rent,a study by PwC suggested.,external Allow Twitter content?

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. Young people have been particularly affected across the country, because 25 to 34-year-olds make up the largest proportion of the rental market. There is concern that young adults are being priced out of areas where they want to work, and are unable to save enough for a deposit towards their first property. Rent controls have been suggested as a way of limiting how much people are spending. There is no official measure of what an ""unaffordable"" rent is, but several housing organisations suggest rent should be no more than 30% of income. The private rental sector was regulated for a lot of the 20th Century. In 1915 rent controls were introduced in the UK, capping prices at August 1914 levels. Costs had been driven up by an increased demand for housing. Rules were relaxed before the outbreak of World War Two, but reintroduced in 1939 as housebuilding slowed. They stayed in place until 1968. The regulation of rent for new private tenancies was only abolished in 1989. Rent control: Does it work? Rent controls: Who might gain, who might lose and how might it work? Berlin recently approved a planto freeze rents for the next five years,on top of its existing rent controls. The German capital saw protests urging the authorities to keep housing affordable. The average monthly rent for a furnished Berlin flat is about â¬1,100 (Â£940). A fair rent march in Berlin: The top banner reads ""My home is not your profit"" The plan still needs to be approved by the state parliament. It could apply to 1.4 million properties, but not to social housing - which has separate rules - or new-builds. Across Germany, one-fifth of tenants in the private rented sector say they spend more than 40% of their disposable income on rent. In Paris, average rents are assigned to different areas,,externalwith landlords unable to charge more than 20% above that price. And in New York City new laws were introduced in June,,externalestablishing permanent rent controls. Cities in the rest of the state can also adopt controls. Rent controls introduced in San Francisco may have had an unexpected knock-on effect. A Stanford University study in 2017,externalfound that measures introduced there led some landlords to convert their properties into expensive apartments. That was because these were classed as new-builds, which were exempt from the restrictions. Researchers found that between 1994 and 2010, people in rent-controlled properties paid about $2.9bn (Â£2.3bn) less in rent. But they also found that renters who came to the city later paid an extra $2.9bn over the same period, largely because of a shortage of housing. The Labour Party says it would introduce rent controls to help tenants in the private sector. It has also pledged to introduce open-ended tenancies to protect them from unfair evictions. In Scotland, more than 12,000 people signed a petition calling on the Scottish government to introduce ""proper rent controls"". In December 2017,changes to Scottish law brought an end to fixed-term tenancies.Rent increases can now only be made once every 12 months. The current Welsh governmenthas not indicated an intention to pursue such a policy.,external In Northern Ireland, there is rent control on unfit private tenancies that began after 1 April 2007,externaland some other types of tenancy. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has voiced support for rent control in New York But some people have questioned what rent controls could mean for the housing market. A 2015 survey of private landlords by University of Cambridge,externalsuggested that a three-year freeze on existing private rents would not make much difference to affordability. More radical measures, like setting rents at two-thirds of the current market value, could lead landlords to sell their properties. Jonathan Cribb, an economist for the Institute for Fiscal Studies, previously suggested rent controls could affect the quality of housing. Landlords could look for other ways to save costs, he said, ""and a key way to do that is to not maintain the property"". London mayor calls for rent control powers Where does rent hit young people the hardest? Berlin backs rent freeze amid housing pressure High rents 'make young people less mobile' Rent control: Does it work?

"The Conservative manifesto pledges to add 50,000 nurses to the workforce in England by 2024-25. How realistic is this target, particularly given that nurse numbers have gone up by only about 5,000 since 2010? Workforce is one of the main concerns for the NHS in England right now.  Health employers talk of difficulties filling rotas and worries about how future staff can be recruited at a time of rising patient demand. In an attempt to address that, the Conservatives have said that if re-elected they would take action to address the problem. This will be achieved, according to the party, by training more staff, international recruitment and better retention of existing nurses. Measured by full-time equivalent posts, there are currently around 280,000 nurses in England. This does not include the more than 40,000 vacancies for nursing roles. The Conservatives' pledge implies a net increase to around 330,000 by 2024-25 - that is nurses in posts and not including vacancies. Staff shortages 'abusing good will of nurses' NHS 'no chance of training enough staff' The party says 14,000 more nurses will be trained with extra clinical placements funded in the NHS. A maintenance grant (scrapped by the Conservative Government in 2017,external) will be reintroduced. This will range between Â£5,000 and Â£8,000, depending on clinical areas with most need for new nurses. But tuition fees for nurses - not levied before 2017, but currently up to Â£9,250 a year - will not be scrapped. The party refers to ""reducing attrition during the course"", in other words persuading more students to finish their training for example by raising the quality of clinical placements. Another 5,000 more nursing staff will come from apprenticeships which are designed to allow recruits to be trained in the workplace without the need to pay tuition fees and study at university. Some of these, it is assumed, would be existing nursing associates who would gain additional qualifications. Nursing associates bridge the gap between health and care assistants and registered nurses, who are    freed up to focus on more complex clinical care. But the Nuffield Trust think tank notes that the nurse apprenticeship scheme is relatively new and by the middle of 2018, only 300 people had started. That 19,000 total compares with Labour's promise of 24,000 more trained nurses (Labour wants to scrap tuition fees and reintroduce maintenance grants). The Conservatives want to see 12,500 more nurses recruited from overseas. According toresearch by the House of Commons library,external, 16% of nurses in England are non-British nurses.  In modern times the NHS has always required international recruitment. The question is whether the extra 12,500 on top of existing efforts is achievable. The Conservatives argue that halving the cost of visas will help attract more staff from outside the UK. But the health surcharge (levied to cover a foreign worker's care needs should they arise) will increase under the party's plans. What is more, EU recruits who currently can work in the UK without any additional cost burden, will have to pay these fees after Brexit. The Conservatives' target looks ambitious. The Conservatives say that 18,500 extra nurses can be found by using policies to ensure fewer leave the NHS. The aim is to lower the proportion of staff who leave each year, known as the turnover rate.  In other words the aim is to ensure that 18,500 nurses who might otherwise have left remain in their jobs. NHS England is already addressing this issue by promoting more flexible working, enhancing continuing professional development and encouraging highly qualified staff who have left in recent years to return to the NHS. Internal projections suggest that as many as 20,000 nursing staff who might have otherwise quit could still be working for the NHS in five years' time. But much will depend on the money allocated in the spending review after the election for public sector pay, a key factor in retaining staff. Both inside the NHS and among independent health commentators there is agreement that around 50,000 more nurses than now will need to be working in the service in five years' time. The Health Foundation, Nuffield Trust and King's Fund think tanks, ina joint report,external, argued that 5,000 nurses will have to be recruited annually from overseas over four years to avoid staff shortages even if other initiatives are pursued to boost the workforce such as reintroducing maintenance grants. That would mean 20,000 more internationally recruited nurses by 2023, considerably more than the Conservative plan. Training, they argue is essential, but it is not an immediate solution as it takes three years for nurses to qualify. Culture Secretary Nicky Morgan, in broadcast interviews, said the party pledge for 50,000 was over 10 years. This caused confusion as there was no specific date in the manifesto. However, briefing notes issued alongside the document referred to the target being reached by 2024-25, at the end of the next Parliament. Conservative sources have indicated that Ms Morgan was wrong to refer to 10 years and that the pledge is a five-year one. What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

"At your service: The prime minister visits the Royal Welsh Winter Fair at Llanelwedd Boris Johnson has launched the Welsh Conservatives' manifesto for the general election. The prime minister, speaking at Bangor-on-Dee racecourse, Wrexham, has promised to ""unleash a tide of investment"". Mr Johnson had returned to the Clwyd South constituency, which he contested in 1997. It follows thepublication of the Conservatives' UK-wide manifestoin Telford, Shropshire, on Sunday. ""I started this project 22 years ago,"" he told the audience, adding that it was ""absolutely vital that we get a Conservative elected here"". Mr Johnson said the Tories had high ambitions in Wales, including resolving the long delays at the Brynglas Tunnels along the M4 at Newport. He said the tunnels were blocked ""like the nostrils of the Welsh dragon"", adding his party would be the ""Vicks inhaler"". The visit to Wales began in Powys with a bid to court the farming vote at the Royal Welsh Winter Fair in Llanelwedd, joking how Jeremy Corbyn and Labour would ""fleece the entire country"". He said the Brexit deal he had secured with the European Union would keep farming ""absolutely protected"" and enabled his party to find more markets. Mr Johnson said his party would also back the Welsh steel industry. TheMarches Growth Deal,externalincludes a specific focus on improving cross-border road infrastructure. In October, the UK government announced Â£55m over 15 years for aMid Wales Growth Deal, which followed the Â£500m Cardiff City Deal, the Â£115m Swansea City Deal and the Â£120m North Wales Growth Deal. Speaking before the visit, Mr Johnson repeated his plan ""to get Brexit done"" in order to ""unleash this domestic agenda and deliver our exciting plans for Wales"". The party's UK manifesto included a specific section on Wales, which promised the country ""major investments"" in infrastructure and industry if the Tories win the general election. It included some previous announcements, such as plans for aWest Wales Parkway stationoutside Swansea,  and promises on devolved issues that are the responsibility of the Welsh Government, such as delivering a new M4 relief road. Other policies that apply to Wales include: 20,000 more police officers across Wales and England A ""triple tax lock"", ruling out increases in the UK rate of income tax and National Insurance, as well as VAT, for five years Raising the National Insurance threshold to Â£9,500 in 2020, with an ambition to raise it further to Â£12,500 Tighter immigration controls In a statement released ahead of the Conservatives' Welsh manifesto launch, Mr Johnson said: ""With a Conservative majority government, we will improve connectivity and infrastructure across the whole of our country."" He said the Marches Growth Deal would ""make a real difference for people on both sides of the border"". He added: ""Labour has a rotten record in Wales and has let down people across Wales badly, from healthcare services to a lack of investment in transport networks. The Conservative party will put that right. ""The Welsh dragon will roar louder than ever before."" And the most common name of those seeking election is...

"This video can not be played ""We shouldn't have to be out here doing this again"" Staff at Welsh universities are beginning an eight-day strike over pay, conditions and pensions. Cardiff University and Bangor University will be affected by the strikes which involve members of the University and College Union (UCU) at 60 UK universities. They object to increases to pension contributions, casual contracts and a squeeze on wages. Universities said they had taken steps to protect pensions and pay. University workers vote for eight-day strike Lectures cancelled in university strike Some non-teaching staff at the University of Wales will also be striking, but it will not involve academics teaching students on campuses, the university said. Pickets are expected outside university buildings on Monday, and there are plans for ""teach-outs"" in Cardiff and Bangor where public talks are held off campus. Some Open University staff in Wales are also on strike. Staff will be striking for eight days This is the second time in two years UCU members have taken strike action, after a14-day walk-out over pensions in February 2018. The union said universities had continued to support increased staff contributions to the universities' superannuation scheme pensions system. The other strike ballot focused on casual contracts in universities, the gender pay gap and a squeeze on wages. Union officials said the decision to strike had not been taken lightly. ""Teach-outs"" - public talks off-campus - are being held in both Bangor and Cardiff Doris Merkl-Davies, vice-president of Bangor UCU, said: ""A lot of members, including those on permanent full-time contracts, are feeling the squeeze of declining salaries and increasing living costs, but are prepared to fight for fair wages by going on strike and taking a one-off financial hit."" But Universities UK and the Universities and Colleges Employers Association urged staff to reconsider in an open letter. ""In recent months employers have taken significant steps to protect the value of both pensions and pay because we care about our dedicated and talented staff,"" the letter said. ""We are very sorry that the industrial action called by UCU is likely to cause unwelcome disruption to students"". In open letters to students and staff, Cardiff's vice-chancellor Colin Riordan offered ""sincere apologies"" for inconvenience, adding: ""My priority throughout the strike period is to ensure that any disruption to education and the student experience is minimised."" Colin Riordan wrote an open letter to staff and students He said most teaching would go ahead but in some areas there would be a ""significant impact"". ""I am keen to see this situation resolved as soon as possible, and to avoid further strike action this academic session,"" he added. ""As a university we cannot solve these issues on our own."" He told those striking he ""fully respects"" their decision, adding: ""I also appreciate how difficult this situation is for staff, especially given your commitment and loyalty to your students."" ""I want a solution that meets the needs of employees and employers alike and I will continue to advocate for such an outcome. ""We all know from previous periods of industrial action that emotions can and do run high. ""However, I hope that we will be able to treat one another with dignity, courtesy and respect.""

"Staff at Leicester University have joined the strike Students across the UK face disruption as lecturers and support staff in 60 universities start an eight-day strike. Members of the University and Colleges Union (UCU) are taking action in two separate disputes, one on pensions and one on pay and conditions. The strikes will affect almost half of all UK universities. The universities say strikes are not the way forward and promise to do all they can to minimise the impact of industrial action on students. In addition to striking, union members are taking other forms of industrial action, including working strictly to contract, not covering for absent colleagues and refusing to reschedule lectures lost during the strikes. This latest action follows strikes in February and March last year, meaning some students are being affected for the second time. Staff taking action will walk out between 25 November and 4 December and the union has not ruled out further action next term. 'We want our lecturers to be there and be happy' University workers vote for eight-day strike 2018: Strike action suspended in pension truce Has the strike affected you? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external UCU says staff have reached ""breaking point"" over a number of issues, including workloads, real-terms cuts in pay, a 15% gender pay gap and changes to pensions for staff in the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS), which the union says will leave members paying in more and receiving less in retirement. UCU general secretary Jo Grady said about 43,600 members would be taking strike action for ""systemic change"". Dr Grady said the higher education sector had ""made a lot of money over the past 10 years"" but that spending on staff in that period had gone down and that there had been ""an attack on working conditions in the sector"". The UCU is angry that members are now having to pay 9.6% in pension contributions, up from 8% and wants universities to pay the full increase instead. The union estimates that, overall, changes to the pension could leave lecturers about Â£240,000 worse off in retirement, rising to Â£730,000 for professors. This video can not be played Newcastle University students conflicted over strike But the University and Colleges Employers Association and Universities UK say employers have increased their pension contributions from 18% to 21.1% of salary, paying in an extra Â£250m each year. The employers say even increasing their contributions to 22.7% of salary would cost them Â£373m a year. They have warned that in order to meet the union's current demands, employers ""would have to divert unsustainable amounts of money from other budgets with potential consequences including for jobs, student support, course closures and larger class sizes"". For the employers, Carol Costello of Liverpool University, acknowledged the union's concerns but said recent rises both in staff pay and in employers' contributions to staff pensions were at the limit of affordability. ""It's important that the... pension scheme trustees secure the benefits for the future of the 230,000 staff in the scheme,"" Ms Costello told the BBC. ""They've got to meet the legal requirements that the Pensions Regulator sets out. ""We believe that what the Pensions Regulator has said is that ultimately the level of contributions that we're putting in is at the limit."" Dr Claire Marris is a food policy expert at City University At London's City University, the employers' arguments do not convince staff like Dr Claire Marris. ""I'm going on strike because I really care about the education that we deliver to our students and I feel our working conditions are being eroded,"" Dr Marris told BBC news. She says that although she loves her teaching and research she feels her pay and pension ""which is essentially deferred pay"" are being whittled away. ""By giving us less money and expecting us to do more and more work, they're making it really hard for us to deliver the quality education and the quality research which we want to do and that we want to contribute to society. ""I want parents out there who are paying the fees for their children to know that 50% of the staff in universities today are casual staff, they are on short-term contracts, they are on hourly contracts and yet that's the money they are paying those fees for and I think that money should be invested in staff."" Master's student Lucy is conflicted about the strike Lucy, a master's broadcast journalism student, is conflicted. ""I'm angry because I've paid all this money for this course... it makes it seem that this course is not important. ""Obviously I do understand why they striking... I do understand but there are different ways of going about it... I just don't think that's fair."" Grace, another trainee journalist, said losing a week out of such a short course was ""really frustrating"". She believes strikes during her undergraduate course affected her final mark: ""I had no dissertation tutor for six weeks... so for it to be happening again is just really annoying."" A young man in the first year of his undergraduate degree said while he supported the staff in terms of workers' rights ""the timing isn't the best"". He has an assignment presentation due before the end of term but, with his seminar leader out on strike, he's not sure when or if it will take place. ""It is disturbing the rhythm of studying... it's a very pivotal time,"" he said. The action involves members of theUniversities Superannuation Scheme,externalwhich covers staff in pre-1992 universities - those which had university status before former polytechnics became universities. In total, the UCU says 43 universities are taking industrial action over both pensions and pay and conditions: Aston University Bangor University Cardiff University University of Durham Heriot-Watt University Loughborough University Newcastle University Open University University of Aberdeen University of Bath University of Dundee University of Leeds University of Manchester University of Sheffield University of Nottingham University of Stirling University College London University of Birmingham University of Bradford University of Bristol University of Cambridge University of Edinburgh University of Exeter University of Essex University of Glasgow University of Lancaster University of Leicester City University Goldsmiths College Queen Mary University of London Royal Holloway University of Reading University of Southampton University of St Andrews Courtauld Institute of Art University of Strathclyde University of Wales University of Warwick University of York University of Liverpool University of Sussex University of Ulster Queen's University Belfast Staff at a further 14 institutions are striking over pay and conditions only: Bishop Grosseteste University Bournemouth University Edge Hill University Glasgow Caledonian University Glasgow School of Art Liverpool Hope University Liverpool Institute of Performing Arts Queen Margaret University, Edinburgh St Mary's University College, Belfast Roehampton University Sheffield Hallam University University of Brighton University of Kent University of Oxford And staff at three universities are walking out in a dispute over pensions alone: Scottish Association of Marine Science University of East Anglia Institute of Development Studies LA mayor says winds and drought created 'perfect storm', while officials hit out at looters Biden praises Carter's character as former president's coffin heads to Georgia Henry Zeffman: Market trouble threatens Labour's economic plans The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

"What are the parties offering voters on health and social care? Here are our answers to a selection of readers' questions. The Conservativeshave pledged an additional Â£2.3bn in real terms by 2023-24 for mental health. This is roughly a 20% increase on the current mental health budget. They plan to launch regional pilot health schemes focusing on eating disorders, alcohol addiction, psychosis and bipolar disorder. 11 charts on why the NHS matters in this election Why more people are talking about the issue of social care Could the NHS be 'up for sale'? Laboursays it will provide an additional Â£1.6bn a year for mental health by 2023-24 on top of the government's Â£2.3bn pledge. It would spend more on services for people with eating disorders, and on upgrading hospital facilities. The Liberal Democratswant a 1% income tax increase, to go to the NHS and social care. Of that, 30% would be spent on mental health. This represents an additional Â£2.2bn a year, mostly for England. They want to improve waiting times, and increase access to talking therapies. Laboursays it will set up a national care service. Personal care - help with washing and dressing - will be provided free. This seems bold, but much will depend on how frail an individual is expected to be before they get help - the impact could be limited. Both theConservativesandLib Demspromise more investment in the social care system. They say they will work with other political parties to find a solution to the problems with the care system. Only a fifth of older people who need help get support from the state. TheTorieshave also explicitly committed to ensuring people do not have to sell their homes to pay for care. But how this will be achieved is not yet clear. In government theConservativeshave set out afive-year funding planwhich started this year. It will see the budget rise by 3.4% a year on average, so that by 2023-24, Â£149bn will be spent on front-line services. They have promised 50,000 more nurses in England and the creation of 50 million more GP appointments. Labour has said it will spend more: another Â£6bn extra a year by 2023-24,which the Lib Dems have pledged to match. But the gap could be smaller, as theTorieshave promised to provide extra support to the NHS to cover its rising pension bill. The parties' priorities for spending are remarkably similar - more staff, reduced waiting times and renovation of buildings. Both theLib DemsandLabourhave promised to re-introduce bursaries to help nurses fund their studies. Health is devolved, so Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland can make their own decisions. Private firms are already involved in providing NHS care. Just over 7% of the budget goes on private providers, up from just over 5% in 2011-12. Under current rules, foreign firms with a European subsidiary can bid for NHS contracts. A few US companies work in the NHS, particularly in England, on a fairly small scale. The UK currently allows competition in its markets - including public services - as part of the EU single market. Under EU law, there are explicit protections for health services (which a judge has to take into consideration if a dispute between a foreign company and a member state gets to court). It is possible that the US government would want to negotiate a trade deal that didn't include these kinds of protections, or which could allow US companies to cherry-pick the most lucrative cases. But it is not clear that any UK government would agree to such terms. CONFUSED?Our simple election guide,external POLICY GUIDE:Who should I vote for?,external POLLS:How are the parties doing?,external A TO Z:Our tool to explain election words,external REGISTER:What you need to do to vote IN-DEPTH:More general election explainers and features In absolute terms, this is correct - there are 89,000 more people working for NHS England than when the Conservative-led coalition took office in May 2010. That represents about a 9% increase, and a record amount of doctors and nurses in England. Yet current vacancies are close to 100,000, representing the number of extra nurses, doctors and health assistants the NHS says it needs to run its services. This is partly down to growing pressure on the health service as the population grows and ages. In A&E, for example, attendances have increased by over 20% in the same period. Health think-tanks expect these vacancies to increase as the social care system struggles to keep up with an ageing population. The NHS is mainly funded from taxes. The NHS budget was Â£114bn in 2018-19. On top of this there are National Insurance contributions, a compulsory payment made by employers and workers. In addition, a small proportion of NHS funding - 1.1% in 2018-19 - comes from patient charges, including those for prescriptions and dental treatment.

"Labour has vowed to ""put bad landlords out of business"" and bring in rent controls in England, if it wins power. Private rents would not be allowed to go up by more than inflation - and landlords would be fined for letting out sub-standard property. A Labour government would also bring in ""open-ended"" tenancies, to protect tenants from unfair evictions. The Tories have also set out plans to help tenants - including scrapping ""no fault"" evictions. Under Labour's ""private renters' charter"", landlords would face an annual ""property MOT"", with fines of up to Â£100,000 or forced repayment of rent if their properties are found to be sub-standard. Live: Latest from election campaign trail How rent controls could change the way we live What is Labour offering to Waspi women? If the party wins the general election on 12 December, rent increases would be capped at the national inflation rate. Areas with high rents would be able to make the case for further controls, local councils would get beefed-up enforcement powers and renters unions would be given government funding. The BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith said the policy reflected a wider view within Labour that the private sector could not be trusted in many areas and the state had to step in - a major dividing line with the Conservatives. The private rented sector accounts for 21% of households in England - a figure that has doubled since 1997,according to the Office for National Statistics.,external Labour said its research has found that tenants collectively pay more than Â£10bn a year in rent to landlords letting out sub-standard homes. The party claims one-in-four private rented homes in England are classed as ""non-decent"", meaning they are damp, cold, in disrepair or unsafe to live in. Labour plans tax on foreign firms buying property Tories plan stamp duty hike on non-UK residents Housing spokesman John Healey told BBC Breakfast ""these are standards that cannot be allowed to go on for longer"". While most landlords provided decent and secure accommodation, he said successive governments had allowed ""rogue landlords to flourish"", while tenants had fewer rights and protections than if they were hiring a car or household goods. ""This is about making all properties and all landlords operate to the sort of standards that the better ones already do. When one in four kids are growing up in private rented accommodation, this is the type of home which must be better, more secure and more affordable,"" he said. Under Labour's ""open-ended"" tenancies plan, tenants will only be able to be evicted on tightly-defined grounds, such as non-payment of rent or criminal behaviour in the property, or if the landlord plans to move back into the property. The Conservatives have also vowed to outlaw Section 21 notices, which allow landlords to evict renters without a reason after their fixed-term tenancy period ends. A Conservative spokesman said Labour's plans would ""hurt the renters they claim to want to help by hiking up rents"". Polly Neate, chief executive of housing charity Shelter, said: ""For decades renters have had to live with the fear of being evicted from their home for no reason, with damaging consequences particularly for families with children and the elderly. ""This election marks a major step forward in the battle to secure basic protections for those who rent, as Labour and the Conservatives have made clear that they will scrap this outrageous practice, and give renters the security and stability they deserve."" The Residential Landlords Association claimed Labour's proposals would ""lead to a serious rental housing crisis"". Policy director David Smith said: ""The sector does not need new obligations, but better enforcement of those that already exist."" In addition to ending ""no fault"" evictions, the Conservatives say they would bring in ""lifetime deposits"", which would allow an initial lump sum to be transferred from one home to the next. The party says in its manifesto these measures will protect tenants ""from revenge evictions and rogue landlords"". It also says it will strengthen rights of possession for ""the many good landlords"". The Liberal Democrats say they will introduce longer-term tenancies and bring in controls on annual rent increases, linked to inflation. The Green Party proposes rent controls, more secure tenancy agreements and an end to ""no fault"" evictions. Housing policy is devolved to the UK's national parliaments. In December 2017, changes to Scottish law brought an end to fixed-term tenancies. Rent increases can now only be made once every 12 months. The current Welsh governmenthas not indicated an intention to pursue such a policy,external. In Northern Ireland, there is rent control on unfit private tenancies that began after 1 April 2007 and some other types of tenancy. Do you have any questions about the election?

"This video can not be played Security camera footage showed figures with torches and tools smashing one of the cabinets Burglars have stolen three diamond jewellery sets from one of Europe's largest treasure collections - the Dresden Green Vault in eastern Germany. The historic sets consist of 37 parts each, and there are fears the thieves may try to break them up. Officials are still trying to establish exactly how much was stolen in the break-in early on Monday. Saxony's ruler, Augustus the Strong, created the collection in 1723 in what is one of the world's oldest museums. ""Three out of 10 diamond sets have gone,"" said Marion Ackermann, head of the Dresden state museums. Jewellery thefts that shocked the world Jewels seized in armed raid on luxury Paris hotel The stolen sets from the Green Vault (GrÃ¼nes GewÃ¶lbe) are reported to also include some rubies, emeralds and sapphires. The thieves - still on the run - removed part of an iron grille on a ground-floor window, then smashed the glass. The Green Vault is a world-famous treasure collection At about 05:00 (04:00 GMT) on Monday, firefighters were called to tackle a blaze in a nearby electricity junction box. There is speculation that the fire disabled the museum's alarm system. It put out some of the street lights. Police are examining CCTV footage which shows two suspects in the dark. But more people may have been involved in the robbery. A car found burning in Dresden early on Monday may have been the getaway vehicle used by the burglars, police say. Giant gold coin trial opens in Berlin The museum had guards on duty at night, Ms Ackermann said. Dozens of police cars are at the scene and the Green Vault in central Dresden is now shut. ""Three out of 10 diamond sets have gone,"" said Ms Ackermann. However, Dresden police and museum officials did not provide any further details. Ms Ackermann described them as ""priceless - we can't put a figure on it"". ""The items cannot be sold on the art market legally - they're too well known,"" she said. The baroque palace was hit in World War Two air raids, but Dresden restored it Ms Ackermann stressed that the cultural value of the unique collection was far greater than its material value. The popular German daily Bild saidthe thieves had grabbed jewels,externalworth â¬1bn (Â£855m). The collection is housed in eight ornate rooms in the Residenzschloss - a former royal palace. Three rooms were destroyed by Allied bombing in World War Two, but after the war, the museum was restored to its previous glory. It is called the Green Vault because some rooms were decorated with malachite-green paint. The Green Vault houses treasured items such as this 16th-Century Indian mother-of-pearl box The most valuable items are in the palace's historic section on the ground floor. There are about 3,000 items of jewellery and other treasures decorated with gold, silver, ivory and pearl. They include a figure of a moor studded with emeralds and a 648-carat sapphire - a royal gift from Russia's Tsar Peter the Great. One of the most valuable jewels is a 41-carat green diamond currently on show in New York. The collection was founded by Augustus the Strong. He was Elector of Saxony (a German prince entitled to take part in the election of the emperor) and later king of Poland. Saxony's minister-president, Michael Kretschmer, voiced outrage at the crime, saying ""not only were the state art collections burgled, but the people of Saxony too"". ""The valuables housed in the Green Vault and Residenzschloss were acquired by people in the Saxony Free State with difficulty, over many centuries."" He said the collection was an integral part of Saxony's history.

As the Labour Party mentioned in its response to the Chief Rabbi, it is launching a manifesto on race and faith issues tomorrow. We have already been told that the party will set out policies on combatting anti-Semitism and it will also detail how children should be taught in schools about what the British Empire did to the rest of the world back in the days when Britain was truly a colonial superpower. The plans include creating an ""emancipation educational trust"" to ensure ""historical injustice, colonialism and role of the British empire is taught in the national curriculum"". It also says it wants new measures to tackle racial pay gaps and a race equality unit within the Treasury to examine the impact of policies on BAME communities. Read the full story Martin BashirBBC News This is a sweeping and unequivocal condemnation of Labour's leadership, its treatment of Jewish parliamentarians and its handling of allegations of anti-Semitism. It's also highly unusual for such an intervention by the leader of a religious denomination during a general election campaign. The Chief Rabbi has pastoral oversight of half the population of those who identify as Jewish in the United Kingdom. Last week. the Archbishops of Canterbury and York appealed to voters and politicians to ""honour the truth"" and ""challenge falsehoods"" but there was no specific criticism of individual candidates nor their party leaders. But the Chief Rabbi's article, to be published in the Times newspaper on Tuesday, asks if Jeremy Corbyn is fit for high office and calls on voters to consider what the result of this election ""will say about the moral compass of this country?"" Last year, three Jewish newspapers - The Jewish Chronicle, The Jewish News and The Jewish Telegraph - published exactly the same front cover on 25th July 2018 - arguing that a Labour government under the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn would prove ""an existential threat"" to British Jewry. The Chief Rabbi, in this highly critical column, is saying much the same. ""Jeremy Corbyn is a lifelong campaigner against anti-Semitism and has made absolutely clear it has no place in our party and society and that no-one who engages in it does so in his name,"" a Labour spokesman says. ""A Labour government will guarantee the security of the Jewish community, defend and support the Jewish way of life, and combat rising anti-Semitism in our country and across Europe. Our race and faith manifesto [which will be launched tomorrow], sets out our policies to achieve this."" The Chief Rabbi says it is a ""mendacious fiction"" that Labour has investigated all outstanding cases of anti-Semitism, claiming that at least 130 cases before the party are outstanding and ""thousands"" were reported but remain unresolved. But Labour says: ""The 130 figure is inaccurate and it is categorically untrue to suggest there are thousands of outstanding cases. We are taking robust action to root out anti-Semitism in the party, with swift suspensions, processes for rapid expulsions and an education programme for members."" Morte on that opinion piece from the Chief Rabbi. Ephraim Mirvis,writing in the Times,external, says that the ""Jewish community has watched with incredulity as supporters of the Labour leadership have hounded parliamentarians, members and even staff out of the party for challenging anti-Jewish racism"". He says: ""The way in which the leadership has dealt with anti-Jewish racism is incompatible with the British values of which we are so proud - of dignity and respect for all people. It has left many decent Labour members both Jewish and non-Jewish, ashamed of what has transpired."" He says it is not his place to tell people how to vote but asks what the election will say about the UK's ""moral compass"". ""When December 12 arrives, I ask every person to vote with their conscience. Be in no doubt, the very soul of our nation is at stake,"" he says. The Chief Rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, criticises the Labour Party, writing in the Times that it is not doing enough to root out anti-Semitism. He asks people to vote with their conscience in the forthcoming general election. ""Prime Ditherer"" - used as an insult towards Jeremy Corbyn and his neutral stance on Brexit - has been the Tories' attack slogan of the day. It was unveiled on a Conservative election poster (with a picture of Jeremy Corbyn) by Culture Secretary Nicky Morgan this morning. Health Secretary Matt Hancock later used the words in an interview, saying: ""So Jeremy Corbyn is the prime ditherer as demonstrated by his position, his various positions on Brexit, and his lack of a position now."" And then Boris Johnson later said of Mr Corbyn: ""He doesn't want to be prime minister, he wants to be prime ditherer. He used to be indecisive, now he's not so sure."" Nicky Morgan claimed it was Conservative Central HQ who came up with the phrase. But look at this tweet from 2016,  and the accompanying Sunday Mirror column, and it does seem that Labour's John Prescott was the one who coined the phrase - about then-PM Theresa May.

If you missed that 30-minute Andrew Neil interview of the SNP's Nicola Sturgeon and want a quick upsum, here it is:  A full report can be read here. Much of the reaction online following the interview of SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon is praise for the ""forensic"" questioning, which they said put the Scottish First Minister under pressure. Some viewers thought that Andrew Neil ""out-questioned and out-answered"" his interviewee, but a Sturgeon supporter says she was honest, articulate and had a firm command of the facts. Several posters on social media speculate how other party leaders will fare under a similar grilling. You can find out how Jeremy Corbyn gets on tomorrow at 7pm on BBC One. Allow Twitter content?

That's all from Nicola Sturgeon speaking to Andrew Neil.You can watch the full interview here. Finally, Ms Sturgeon - a former health minister - is challenged on the performance of Scotland's NHS under the SNP. Mr Neil says Scotland is failing to meet its target for the number of patients treated within 12 weeks, at only 72%. ""Itâs not good enough,"" Ms Sturgeon says. But she says they are taking steps to address it with an Â£850m plan. Mr Neil brings up ""children dying in a Glasgow hospital because the water is contaminated"", Scotland's drug problem and a new Edinburgh hospital which has not opened after nine years. Ms Sturgeon says she is increasing investment in drug services and there are inquiries into the other issues. ""Yes, we have challenges in Scotland but we are dealing with
these challenges more effectively than the rest of the UK,"" she says. Mr Neil quotes an assessment by the Institute for Fiscal Studies which says that independence would require another decade of ""restraint on public spending"", saying that austerity would continue. But Ms Sturgeon says she doesn't accept that assessment. She says if the growth commission's recommendations had been followed over the last ten years, Scotland would have escaped austerity. The SNP has warned that trade friction caused by Brexit
could mean 80,000 jobs lost in Scotland. Mr Neil asks, why wonât trade friction
with the rest of the UK harm the economy after independence? The SNP leader says we âdonât yet know the final
relationship with EUâ and adds that itâs not independence that causes the trade friction, ""itâs Brexit"". She says it's in Scotland's interests to remain in the EU, a much larger market, and draws a comparison with Ireland's success in increasing exports. Challenged on how quickly Scotland could rejoin the EU if Brexit
goes ahead and the country votes for independence, Ms Sturgeon says she is ânot
going to give a specific timescaleâ but it âcould be relatively quickâ. But Mr Neil says Scotlandâs Growth Commission says it could be
five or ten years, as the country would need to establish its own currency. Ms Sturgeon says she is âabsolutely certainâ that an independent
currency would not be a requirement. âWe would have a discussion with the EU
about the journey"" Scotland was on in terms of an independent currency, she
says. Mr Neil says Scotland would also be required to build
substantial reserves in its new currency and asks how it can do that with the
largest deficit in Europe. Ms Sturgeon says Scotland is reducing its deficit faster than
expected. âOur task is to get our deficit reducing faster. That is principally
through growing our economy faster, which remaining in the EU or returning to the
EU helps us to do,â she says. This video can not be played General election 2019: Independent Scotland joining EU? Mr Neil turns his questions to the practicalities of
securing a Scottish independence referendum and establishing Scotland as a
separate state. Ms Sturgeon previously said Brexit was a âmaterial changeâ that
justified asking the Scottish people about independence again. But Mr Neil
asks, if she blocks Brexit, doesnât that justification disappear? Ms Sturgeon says: âThe material change is the way in which
Scotland has had it completely demonstrated to it over the last three years
that our views and our voice doesnât matter.â She adds that âour future path as a country is not in our
hands, itâs in the hands of Westminster politicians like Boris Johnson with his
strings being pulled by Nigel Farageâ. The other requirement for another referendum was for âclear
and sustainedâ support for independence in opinion polls, says Mr Neil. He says
that hasnât been met either. âAlmost all opinion polls show increasing support for
independence. They show increasing support for a second referendum,â she says. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.999997

"This video can not be played ""We shouldn't have to be out here doing this again"" Staff at Welsh universities are beginning an eight-day strike over pay, conditions and pensions. Cardiff University and Bangor University will be affected by the strikes which involve members of the University and College Union (UCU) at 60 UK universities. They object to increases to pension contributions, casual contracts and a squeeze on wages. Universities said they had taken steps to protect pensions and pay. University workers vote for eight-day strike Lectures cancelled in university strike Some non-teaching staff at the University of Wales will also be striking, but it will not involve academics teaching students on campuses, the university said. Pickets are expected outside university buildings on Monday, and there are plans for ""teach-outs"" in Cardiff and Bangor where public talks are held off campus. Some Open University staff in Wales are also on strike. Staff will be striking for eight days This is the second time in two years UCU members have taken strike action, after a14-day walk-out over pensions in February 2018. The union said universities had continued to support increased staff contributions to the universities' superannuation scheme pensions system. The other strike ballot focused on casual contracts in universities, the gender pay gap and a squeeze on wages. Union officials said the decision to strike had not been taken lightly. ""Teach-outs"" - public talks off-campus - are being held in both Bangor and Cardiff Doris Merkl-Davies, vice-president of Bangor UCU, said: ""A lot of members, including those on permanent full-time contracts, are feeling the squeeze of declining salaries and increasing living costs, but are prepared to fight for fair wages by going on strike and taking a one-off financial hit."" But Universities UK and the Universities and Colleges Employers Association urged staff to reconsider in an open letter. ""In recent months employers have taken significant steps to protect the value of both pensions and pay because we care about our dedicated and talented staff,"" the letter said. ""We are very sorry that the industrial action called by UCU is likely to cause unwelcome disruption to students"". In open letters to students and staff, Cardiff's vice-chancellor Colin Riordan offered ""sincere apologies"" for inconvenience, adding: ""My priority throughout the strike period is to ensure that any disruption to education and the student experience is minimised."" Colin Riordan wrote an open letter to staff and students He said most teaching would go ahead but in some areas there would be a ""significant impact"". ""I am keen to see this situation resolved as soon as possible, and to avoid further strike action this academic session,"" he added. ""As a university we cannot solve these issues on our own."" He told those striking he ""fully respects"" their decision, adding: ""I also appreciate how difficult this situation is for staff, especially given your commitment and loyalty to your students."" ""I want a solution that meets the needs of employees and employers alike and I will continue to advocate for such an outcome. ""We all know from previous periods of industrial action that emotions can and do run high. ""However, I hope that we will be able to treat one another with dignity, courtesy and respect.""

"The crash happened on Saturday A woman says she only discovered a car had crashed into the front of her house and was on fire when a police officer told her. Sylvia Walden, 61, slept through the early morning smash before being woken by the sound of shouting. Three people suffered serious injuries in the incident on the A857 at Barvas in Lewis on Saturday. The car was involved in a police chase. A 32-year-old man was arrested in connection with road traffic offences. He is due to appear in court next month. Sylvia Walden said her first concern was for her dog Ms Walden, 61, was not injured in the incident. She said: ""I believe it was about 01:30.

She said her first concern was for her dog, but was told by the police officer that it was fine before adding that there was a car on fire in her garden.

"Atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases once again reached new highs in 2018. TheWorld Meteorological Organization,external(WMO) says the increase in CO2 was just above the average rise recorded over the last decade. Levels of other warming gases, such as methane and nitrous oxide, have also surged by above average amounts. Since 1990 there's been an increase of 43% in the warming effect on the climate of long lived greenhouse gases. China coal surge threatens Paris climate targets Musicians 'have to be proactive' on climate change Climate signal links global floods and fires The WMO report looks at concentrations of warming gases in the atmosphere rather than just emissions. The difference between the two is that emissions refer to the amount of gases that go up into the atmosphere from the use of fossil fuels, such as burning coal for electricity and from deforestation. Concentrations are what's left in the air after a complex series of interactions between the atmosphere, the oceans, the forests and the land. About a quarter of all carbon emissions are absorbed by the seas, and a similar amount by land and trees. This video can not be played How to reduce your carbon footprint when you fly Using data from monitoring stations in the Arctic and all over the world, researchers say that in 2018 concentrations of CO2 reached 407.8 parts per million (ppm), up from 405.5ppm a year previously. This increase was above the average for the last 10 years and is 147% of the ""pre-industrial"" level in 1750. The WMO also records concentrations of other warming gases, including methane and nitrous oxide. About 40% of the methane emitted into the air comes from natural sources, such as wetlands, with 60% from human activities, including cattle farming, rice cultivation and landfill dumps. Methane is now at 259% of the pre-industrial level and the increase seen over the past year was higher than both the previous annual rate and the average over the past 10 years. Nitrous oxide is emitted from natural and human sources, including from the oceans and from fertiliser-use in farming. According to the WMO, it is now at 123% of the levels that existed in 1750. Last year's increase in concentrations of the gas, which can also harm the ozone layer, was bigger than the previous 12 months and higher than the average of the past decade. What concerns scientists is the overall warming impact of all these increasing concentrations. Known as total radiative forcing, this effect has increased by 43% since 1990, and is not showing any indication of stopping. ""There is no sign of a slowdown, let alone a decline, in greenhouse gases concentration in the atmosphere despite all the commitments under the Paris agreement on climate change,"" said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas. ""We need to translate the commitments into action and increase the level of ambition for the sake of the future welfare of mankind,"" he added. ""It is worth recalling that the last time the Earth experienced a comparable concentration of CO2 was three to five million years ago. Back then, the temperature was 2-3C warmer, sea level was 10-20m higher than now,"" said Mr Taalas. The UN Environment Programme will report shortly on the gap between what actions countries are taking to cut carbon and what needs to be done to keep under the temperature targets agreed in the Paris climate pact. Preliminary findings from this study, published during the UN Secretary General's special climate summit last September, indicated that emissions continued to rise during 2018. Both reports will help inform delegates from almost 200 countries who will meet in Madrid next week for COP25, the annual round of international climate talks.

"The crash happened on Saturday A woman says she only discovered a car had crashed into the front of her house and was on fire when a police officer told her. Sylvia Walden, 61, slept through the early morning smash before being woken by the sound of shouting. Three people suffered serious injuries in the incident on the A857 at Barvas in Lewis on Saturday. The car was involved in a police chase. A 32-year-old man was arrested in connection with road traffic offences. He is due to appear in court next month. Sylvia Walden said her first concern was for her dog Ms Walden, 61, was not injured in the incident. She said: ""I believe it was about 01:30. I was fast asleep and didn't hear the car go into the house. People think it rather funny I didn't get woken up by that."" Ms Walden added: ""I could hear shouting. I got up, opened the door and there was a police officer with a torch saying 'hello, hello this is the police. You need to get out of the house'."" She said her first concern was for her dog, but was told by the police officer that it was fine before adding that there was a car on fire in her garden. ""It was up against the house on fire,"" she said. The car had ended up upright on its bonnet, leaning against Ms Walden's property. Three people were seriously injured in the crash The driver and two passengers of the blue Vauxhall Zafira were taken to Western Isles Hospital in Stornoway for treatment to serious injuries. The incident has been referred to the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner (Pirc) by Police Scotland. It is thought the actions of officers in the lead-up to the crash will be looked into. A Pirc spokesman said: ""As is standard procedure, Police Scotland have referred to the Pirc the circumstances of an incident in the early hours of Saturday 23 November 2019 on the Isle of Lewis.

"At your service: The prime minister visits the Royal Welsh Winter Fair at Llanelwedd Boris Johnson has launched the Welsh Conservatives' manifesto for the general election. The prime minister, speaking at Bangor-on-Dee racecourse, Wrexham, has promised to ""unleash a tide of investment"". Mr Johnson had returned to the Clwyd South constituency, which he contested in 1997. It follows thepublication of the Conservatives' UK-wide manifestoin Telford, Shropshire, on Sunday. ""I started this project 22 years ago,"" he told the audience, adding that it was ""absolutely vital that we get a Conservative elected here"". Mr Johnson said the Tories had high ambitions in Wales, including resolving the long delays at the Brynglas Tunnels along the M4 at Newport. He said the tunnels were blocked ""like the nostrils of the Welsh dragon"", adding his party would be the ""Vicks inhaler"". The visit to Wales began in Powys with a bid to court the farming vote at the Royal Welsh Winter Fair in Llanelwedd, joking how Jeremy Corbyn and Labour would ""fleece the entire country"". He said the Brexit deal he had secured with the European Union would keep farming ""absolutely protected"" and enabled his party to find more markets. Mr Johnson said his party would also back the Welsh steel industry. TheMarches Growth Deal,externalincludes a specific focus on improving cross-border road infrastructure. In October, the UK government announced Â£55m over 15 years for aMid Wales Growth Deal, which followed the Â£500m Cardiff City Deal, the Â£115m Swansea City Deal and the Â£120m North Wales Growth Deal. Speaking before the visit, Mr Johnson repeated his plan ""to get Brexit done"" in order to ""unleash this domestic agenda and deliver our exciting plans for Wales"". The party's UK manifesto included a specific section on Wales, which promised the country ""major investments"" in infrastructure and industry if the Tories win the general election. It included some previous announcements, such as plans for aWest Wales Parkway stationoutside Swansea,  and promises on devolved issues that are the responsibility of the Welsh Government, such as delivering a new M4 relief road. Other policies that apply to Wales include: 20,000 more police officers across Wales and England A ""triple tax lock"", ruling out increases in the UK rate of income tax and National Insurance, as well as VAT, for five years Raising the National Insurance threshold to Â£9,500 in 2020, with an ambition to raise it further to Â£12,500 Tighter immigration controls In a statement released ahead of the Conservatives' Welsh manifesto launch, Mr Johnson said: ""With a Conservative majority government, we will improve connectivity and infrastructure across the whole of our country."" He said the Marches Growth Deal would ""make a real difference for people on both sides of the border"". He added: ""Labour has a rotten record in Wales and has let down people across Wales badly, from healthcare services to a lack of investment in transport networks. The Conservative party will put that right. ""The Welsh dragon will roar louder than ever before."" And the most common name of those seeking election is...

"A record breaking number of people turned out to vote Hong Kong's district elections have delivered an unprecedented landslide victory for the city's pro-democracy movement, leaving the government reeling. For months, young people have visibly been at the helm of demonstrations, protests and clashes, sparked by a now-withdrawn extradition bill which morphed into a broader cry for democracy and police accountability. These elections saw many young and novice candidates take on political heavyweights - in the name of Hong Kong's democracy movement - and emerge victorious. Here are four of their stories. Jimmy Sham has been attacked twice this year In the months since the protest movement began, Jimmy Sham has been beaten up twice - by unknown hammer and bat-wielding assailants for reasons that still remain unclear. Nevertheless the 32-year-old leader of the Civil Human Rights Front (CHRF), one of Hong Kong's largest pro-democracy groups which has organised several major rallies, has emerged one of the biggest winners. He won his seat in the Lek Yuen constituency by almost 1,000 votes over the incumbent Michael Wong of the pro-Beijing Civil Force. Mr Sham  might have risen to prominence as leader of the CHRF but he has been an active LGBT rights campaigner for years and even in the last few months his gay identity became the focus of attacks on him on social media. The most recent physical assault on Mr Sham in Octoberleft him lying in the street and covered in blood. The CHRF linked that attack to government supporters. Why are there protests in Hong Kong? What is the Basic Law and how does it work? HK leader will 'seriously reflect' after election He persisted with his vocal campaign and is quoted as saying after his victory:  ""No matter how strong Carrie Lam is I hope she can comply with the wishes of the people, fulfil the five demands [and] give the youngsters a chance."" Karrine Fu won her Fort Street constituency by the smallest of margins - just 59 votes. The 23-year-old was born and bred in the Fortress Hill area. She is a third-generation Fujianese  Hong Konger - so is part of a community who came over from China's Fujian province and which is known to be more conservative and pro-Beijing. It makes her victory all the more remarkable. She defeated the incumbent, 45-year-old Hung Lin Cham, a secondary school teacher representing the main pro-Beijing Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong (DAB), who won the past three elections without contest. He is also of Fujianese descent and has held sway over this relatively conservative pro-Beijing  stronghold since 2007. According to news outlet HK01, Ms Fu,  an arts graduate from the University of Hong Kong, decided to run in the district elections precisely because of the anti-government protests. She told the news outlet that she felt ""encouraged"" to do more for Hong Kong as a result of the movement. Reports say she was offered a job in a school but turned it down because of the protests. The university leader beat ""triple councillor"" Horace Cheung By winning the Sai Wan constituency last night, a fourth-year politics and public administration student took out one of the biggest political scalps of the election: Horace Cheung. Mr Cheung is the vice-chairman of the DAB - Hong Kong's largest pro-Beijing party. Jordan Pang made his name with his articulacy and passionate advocacy of the protesters' cause as leader of the Hong Kong University Students' Union. He defeated Mr Cheung, a 45-year-old solicitor who had represented Sai Wan since 2011, by almost 800 votes: a man who was known as a ""triple councillor"" having held positions in the district council, Legislative Council and Executive Council. His opponent said the results of the elections were ""not much to do with local district work"". In a statement on Facebook, Mr Pang said he was ""humbled"" by the victory but added that there was ""still a long road ahead"". The 21-year-old is one of several high-profile student leaders who have received threatening anonymous messages. Mr Pang said he was told to surrender to the police, or face death - but he continued with his campaign. ""The victory today and record-shattering turnout rate reflects exactly the voice of the people amidst this critical plight,"" he told supporters. Cary Lo of the Democratic Party won by around 1,200 votes In what is being celebrated as perhaps the most unexpected victory by pro-democracy activists, Cary Lo of the Democratic Party unseated pro-Beijing politician Junius Ho. The 37-year-old compliance officer beat Mr Ho - one of the city's most controversial politicians - by around 1,200 votes in the Lok Tsui constituency. Mr Ho, a 57-year-old lawyer, became a member of Hong Kong's Legislative Council in 2016 and so he remains a lawmaker. This video can not be played A winner and a loser in Hong Kong's historic poll result But he has recently become a hate-figure among pro-democracy activists, who accused him of helping orchestrate an attack on activists and passers-by in the district of Yuen Long. He denies such links but the anger persisted and earlier this month he was stabbed while campaigning by a man who pretended to be one of his supporters. After the results came out, images of crowds apparently cheering his defeat were circulated on social media. ""I'm moved, the opposition overwhelmed me with congratulations,"" said Mr Ho on social media. ""It is not a bad things to transform their brutality to harmony."" As far as the man who defeated him goes, his Facebook campaign page features footage of him jogging along Hong Kong's waterfront amid friendly exchanges with residents. For all his campaign cunning, many analysts would argue that simply being an alternative to Junius Ho was Cary Lo's major advantage. HK leader will 'reflect' after election rout How is Hong Kong run?

"Clashes between police and protesters have grown increasingly violent Anti-government protests have rocked Hong Kong for months and the situation shows no sign of dying down. Here's all the background you need to know in 100 or 500 words - you can read each individually or in turn. Hong Kong's protests started in June against plans to allow extradition to mainland China. Critics feared this could undermine judicial independence and endanger dissidents. Until 1997, Hong Kong was ruled by Britain as a colony but then returned to China. Under the ""one country, two systems"" arrangement, it has some autonomy, and its people more rights. The bill was withdrawn in September but demonstrations continue and now demand full democracy and an inquiry into police actions. Clashes between police and activists have become increasingly violent, with police firing live bullets and protesters attacking officers and throwing petrol bombs. The extradition bill which triggered the first protest was introduced in April. It would have allowed for criminal suspects to be extradited to mainland China under certain circumstances. Opponents said this risked exposing Hongkongers to unfair trials and violent treatment. They also argued the bill would give China greater influence over Hong Kong and could be used to target activists and journalists. Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets. After weeks of protests, leader Carrie Lam eventually said the bill would be suspended indefinitely. Protesters feared the bill could be revived, so demonstrations continued, calling for it to be withdrawn completely. By then clashes between police and protesters had become more frequent and violent. In September,the bill was finally withdrawn, but protesters said this was ""too little, too late"". On 1 October, while China was celebrating 70 years of Communist Party rule,Hong Kong experienced one of its most ""violent and chaotic days"". An 18-year-old was shot in the chest with a live bullet as protesters fought officers with poles, petrol bombs and other projectiles. The government thenbanned protesters wearing face masks, and in early Novembera pro-Beijing lawmaker was stabbedin the street by a man pretending to be a supporter. One week later,a policeman shot one protesterat close range when activists were trying to set up a road block. Later that day another man was set on fire by anti-government protesters. In November, a standoff between police and students barricaded on the campus of Hong Kong's Polytechnic University becameanother defining moment. Later that month, the territory held local council elections that were seen as a barometer of public opinion. The vote saw a landslide victory for the pro-democracy movement, with 17 of the 18 councils now controlled by pro-democracy councillors. Some protesters have adopted the motto: ""Five demands, not one less!"" These are: For the protests not to be characterised as a ""riot"" Amnesty for arrested protesters An independent inquiry into alleged police brutality Implementation of complete universal suffrage The fifth demand, the withdrawal of the bill, has already been met. Protests supporting the Hong Kong movement have spread across the globe, with rallies taking place in the UK, France, US, Canada and Australia. In many cases, people supporting the demonstrators were confronted by pro-Beijing rallies. Chinese president Xi Jinping has warned against separatism, saying any attempt to divide China would end in ""bodies smashed and bones ground to powder"". Hong Kong is a former British colony handed back to China in 1997. It has its own judiciary and a separate legal system from mainland China. Those rights include freedom of assembly and freedom of speech. But those freedoms - the Basic Law - expire in 2047 and it is not clear what Hong Kong's status will then be.

"Hong Kong is a special administrative region of China When Hong Kong was handed back to China following more than 150 years of British control, the ""one country, two systems"" principle was established as the foundation of the relationship. While Hong Kong is part of China, the policy has given the Special Administrative Region (SAR) a high degree of autonomy. Here is a breakdown of how this unique system works. The ""one country, two systems"" principle is enshrined in a document called the Basic Law - Hong Kong's mini constitution. It was created from an agreement between Britain and China and came into effect on 1 July 1997, the day Hong Kong returned to China. The Basic Law protects rights such as freedom of assembly and freedom of speech - which do not exist in mainland China - and also sets out the structure of governance for the territory. These protections for Hong Kong's way of life are only valid for 50 years - although Chinese officials have recently indicated they could potentially be extended beyond 2047. Hong Kong is ruled by a chief executive with support from a formal body of advisers called the Executive Council. The chief executive is responsible for implementing the Basic Law, signing bills and budgets, promulgating laws - declaring them as in effect - and issuing executive orders. The city also has a two-tiered semi-representative system of government: the law-making Legislative Council and district councils, as well as an independent judiciary. Currently, the chief executive is elected by an Election Committee of 1,500 people, who are in turn chosen by representatives of various sectors in Hong Kong - who only make up a small percentage of the electorate. After the election, the chief executive must be formally appointed to the role by the central Chinese government. The Basic Law states that the ""ultimate aim"" is for the chief executive to be selected by ""universal suffrage upon nomination by a broadly representative nominating committee"". LegCo, as it is widely known, makes and amends Hong Kong's laws. It is currently made up of 90 seats. Of these, 40 seats go to MPs chosen by the Election Committee while another 20 seats are directly voted for by the public. Another 30 seats represent ""functional constituencies"" - these are voted for by smaller groups representing special interests, primarily businesses, banking and trade. Each of Hong Kong's 18 districts has its own local council, whose members are voted in by the public. Elections take place every four years. In the 2020-23 cycle, there are a total of 479 seats - 452 of which are directly elected, and the remaining 27 automatically going to the elected representatives of Hong Kong's tiny rural populations. The district councils have very little actual political power. They're primarily advisory, acting as the eyes and ears of the government at a local level, passing on information about public facilities and services and how funds should be used. They also have access to some funds to spend on environmental improvements or community and cultural projects. But because they give the Hong Kong public a rare chance to vote directly, they can sometimes be seen as a litmus test of public sentiment towards the ruling government. For instance, in 2019 pro-democracy candidates won by a landslide victory, in what was seen as a sign of public unhappiness with the Hong Kong government. Besides controlling Hong Kong's defence and foreign affairs, Beijing has wielded increasing political power over the city. It has introduced various restrictions to Hong Kong's electoral processes over the years. The latest round was in 2021 withreforms aimed at ensuring only ""patriots"" could runfor the chief executive and LegCo elections. The Election Committee, which has immense power in deciding who gets to lead Hong Kong and enter its parliament, is also stacked with pro-Beijing loyalists. In addition, a separate screening committee vets any prospective MP, member of the Election Committee or chief executive candidate, making it easy to bar anyone deemed as being critical of Beijing. Under the Basic Law, Hong Kong's courts are responsible - ""within the limits of [its] autonomy"" - for determining whether the government's actions are legal. But the National People's Congress Standing Committee (NPCSC) - China's top law-making body - holds the ultimate ""power of interpretation"". In 2020, the NPCSC passedthe controversial national security lawfor Hong Kong which criminalises any act of secession, subversion, terrorism, or collusion with foreign forces. This came about after the widespread 2019 protests which saw violent clashes between protesters and police. Critics say the law has hushed political dissent. Following all these changes, some say that China has breached the ""one country, two systems"" principle for Hong Kong. The British government has said, for instance, that the national security law was a ""clear and serious"" violation of their agreement with China. But China has rejected such charges and accused others of ""interference in China's internal affairs"".

"Navy Secretary Richard Spencer said he and Trump did not have the same view of ""discipline"" US Navy chief Richard Spencer has been fired over his handling of the case of a Navy Seal demoted for misconduct. The case of Edward Gallagher, who was convicted for posing with a corpse, had sparked tensions between US President Donald Trump and military officials. The navy officer had been due to face a disciplinary review where he could have been stripped of his Seals membership. There have been differing accounts as to why Richard Spencer was asked to resign. US Defence Secretary Mark Esper said,externalhe had lost confidence in the navy secretary because his private conversations with the White House contradicted his public position. However, Mr Trump said he was not happy with ""cost overruns"" and how Chief Petty Officer Gallagher's trial was run, and suggested this was why Mr Spencer was fired. The White House revolving door: Who's gone? Meanwhile, in a strongly worded letter, Mr Spencer said it was apparent that he and Mr Trump did not have the same view of ""good order and discipline"". ""The lives of our Sailors, Marines and civilian teammates quite literally depend on the professional execution of our many missions,"" he said. Mr Trump has drawn criticism from parts of the military after pardoning army officers convicted of war crimes. Gallagher was accused of stabbing an unarmed 17-year-old Islamic State group prisoner to death and randomly shooting civilians while serving in Iraq in 2017. He was acquitted of those charges and convicted only of the lesser charge of posing with the IS prisoner's corpse. A murder trial that tore band of brothers apart For that, he was demoted, but President Trump later reinstated his rank. Gallagher was formally notified by navy leaders last week that he would face a disciplinary review which could result in his being stripped of his membership of the Seals. Mr Trump tweeted his disapproval of this on Thursday, saying the navy would ""NOT be taking away Warfighter and Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher's Trident Pin"". On Sunday, the defence department said Mr Esper had asked Mr Spencer to resign due to ""his lack of candour"". Mr Spencer had made private proposals to the White House, which he did not share with Mr Esper, and had contradicted his public position, Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffmann said in a statement. According to the Washington Post,,externalMr Spencer had privately suggested to White House officials that if they did not interfere with proceedings against Edward Gallagher, he would ensure that the officer retired as a Navy Seal. However, the New York Times quoted defence officials as saying Mr Trump had been angered by reports that Mr Spencer had threatened to resign if the president intervened in the case. US Navy Seal accused of killing IS teen US war crimes accused wins pre-trial release Mr Trump tweeted on Sunday he was not happy with how the navy had handled Gallagher's trial, and high costs in the navy's contracting procedures. ""Therefore, Secretary of the Navy Richard Spencer's services have been terminated,"" he said, adding: ""Eddie will retire peacefully with all of the honours that he has earned, including his Trident pin."" In his resignation letter to President Trump, Mr Spencer wrote: ""The rule of law is what sets us apart from our adversaries. Good order and discipline is what has enabled our victory against foreign tyranny time and again."" ""Unfortunately, it has become apparent that in this respect, I no longer share the same understanding with the Commander in Chief who appointed me, in regards to the key principle of good order and discipline. ""I cannot in good conscience obey an order that I believe violates the sacred oath I took."" Senior Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer commended Richard Spencer for ""standing up to President Trump when he was wrong, something too many in this administration and the Republican Party are scared to do"". Navy Seal Special Operations Chief Edward Gallagher was accused of war crimes in Iraq Mr Esper has instructed that Gallagher be allowed to retire as a Navy Seal, retaining his Trident pin which symbolises membership of the elite unit. While Mr Esper had wanted the disciplinary process to ""play itself out objectively"", he had decided to let Gallagher keep his pin ""given the events of the last few days"", defence spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said in a statement. He had concluded Gallagher could not receive fair treatment in his case from the navy, AP news reported. ""Secretary Esper will meet with Navy Under Secretary (now Acting Secretary) Thomas Modley and the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Michael Gilday, on Monday morning to discuss the way ahead,"" the statement said. Gallagher told the conservative Fox News channel on Sunday that he intends to retire next Saturday. This video can not be played Trump and the US military: Friends or foe?

"This video can not be played Sir Tim Berners-Lee said it was ""really brazen"". The inventor of the World Wide Web has accused the Conservatives of spreading misinformation during the general election campaign. Sir Tim Berners-Lee described the renaming of a Tory Twitter account as a fact checking body as ""impersonation"". ""That was really brazen,"" he told the BBC. ""It was unbelievable they would do that."" During a live TV leaders' debate on Tuesday the Tory press office account @CCHQ was rebranded ""factcheckuk"". The renaming remained for the duration of the hour-long debate between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn. The Conservatives have said ""no one will have been fooled"" by the move. But Sir Tim said the renaming ""was impersonation. Don't do that. Don't trust people who do that."" He went on to compare what happened with someone impersonating a friend for the purpose of defrauding them. ""What the Conservative Party has done is obviously a no no. That's amazingly blatant,"" Sir Tim said. Tories reject criticism in debate 'fact-check' row Corbyn v Johnson fact-checked The Conservative Party has yet to respond to a BBC request for comment on Sir Tim's criticism, but has previously insisted that it was clear at all times that the Twitter account belonged to the party. The Tories have said ""no-one will have been fooled"" by the renaming The web's creator also called on Facebook to stop allowing targeted political adverts. He issued a personal appeal to the company's founder, Mark Zuckerberg, to ban them before the election. Sir Tim said: ""It's not fair to risk democracy by allowing all these very subtle manipulations with targeted ads which promote completely false ideas. They do it just before the election, and then disappear."" He was speaking as he unveiledContract For The Web,external, an attempt to bring governments, companies and individuals together to shape a better future for the online world. The contract sets out nine principles to halt the misuse of the web and protect it as a force for good. They include making the internet freely available and affordable, and respecting consumers' privacy and their data. A handful of countries have been involved in drawing up the contract, along with companies including Google, Facebook and Microsoft. . Sir Tim admitted that countries such as China and Russia were unlikely to sign up to the project. He also conceded that the US might not be too keen on a document which stresses the importance of net neutrality, the principle that internet providers should treat all net traffic equally. The Trump administration has sought to overturn net neutrality rules brought in under President Obama. ""The current administration hasn't shown any interest in signing up to those kinds of principles,"" he said. But he pointed out that elections were coming up in the UK and the US and urged people to talk to candidates about the Contract for the Web. Thirty years after he created the World Wide Web at the CERN particle physics lab near Geneva, Sir Tim admits that he is concerned about the way it has developed in recent years. As for any optimism about what comes next, he is uncertain: ""If optimism is seeing a place where it could be, which is very empowering to individuals and to humanity. Yes. I am very optimistic. If optimism is being very confident that we will get there - I'm not."" The Web Foundation, which has spent the last year drawing up the detailed clauses behind the Contract for the Web, will now work to get more governments and companies to sign up to it.

"Atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases once again reached new highs in 2018. TheWorld Meteorological Organization,external(WMO) says the increase in CO2 was just above the average rise recorded over the last decade. Levels of other warming gases, such as methane and nitrous oxide, have also surged by above average amounts. Since 1990 there's been an increase of 43% in the warming effect on the climate of long lived greenhouse gases. China coal surge threatens Paris climate targets Musicians 'have to be proactive' on climate change Climate signal links global floods and fires The WMO report looks at concentrations of warming gases in the atmosphere rather than just emissions. The difference between the two is that emissions refer to the amount of gases that go up into the atmosphere from the use of fossil fuels, such as burning coal for electricity and from deforestation. Concentrations are what's left in the air after a complex series of interactions between the atmosphere, the oceans, the forests and the land. About a quarter of all carbon emissions are absorbed by the seas, and a similar amount by land and trees. This video can not be played How to reduce your carbon footprint when you fly Using data from monitoring stations in the Arctic and all over the world, researchers say that in 2018 concentrations of CO2 reached 407.8 parts per million (ppm), up from 405.5ppm a year previously. This increase was above the average for the last 10 years and is 147% of the ""pre-industrial"" level in 1750. The WMO also records concentrations of other warming gases, including methane and nitrous oxide. About 40% of the methane emitted into the air comes from natural sources, such as wetlands, with 60% from human activities, including cattle farming, rice cultivation and landfill dumps. Methane is now at 259% of the pre-industrial level and the increase seen over the past year was higher than both the previous annual rate and the average over the past 10 years. Nitrous oxide is emitted from natural and human sources, including from the oceans and from fertiliser-use in farming. According to the WMO, it is now at 123% of the levels that existed in 1750. Last year's increase in concentrations of the gas, which can also harm the ozone layer, was bigger than the previous 12 months and higher than the average of the past decade. What concerns scientists is the overall warming impact of all these increasing concentrations. Known as total radiative forcing, this effect has increased by 43% since 1990, and is not showing any indication of stopping. ""There is no sign of a slowdown, let alone a decline, in greenhouse gases concentration in the atmosphere despite all the commitments under the Paris agreement on climate change,"" said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas. ""We need to translate the commitments into action and increase the level of ambition for the sake of the future welfare of mankind,"" he added. ""It is worth recalling that the last time the Earth experienced a comparable concentration of CO2 was three to five million years ago. Back then, the temperature was 2-3C warmer, sea level was 10-20m higher than now,"" said Mr Taalas. The UN Environment Programme will report shortly on the gap between what actions countries are taking to cut carbon and what needs to be done to keep under the temperature targets agreed in the Paris climate pact. Preliminary findings from this study, published during the UN Secretary General's special climate summit last September, indicated that emissions continued to rise during 2018. Both reports will help inform delegates from almost 200 countries who will meet in Madrid next week for COP25, the annual round of international climate talks.

"Australia says it has been ""actively investigating"" the alleged plot Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison says allegations of a plot to plant a Chinese spy in Canberra's parliament are ""deeply disturbing"". The allegations - first aired by local network Nine - assert that a suspected Chinese espionage ring approached a Chinese-Australian man to run as an MP. The 32-year-old man has since died in unexplained circumstances. China has denied the allegations, which Australia's domestic spy agency has confirmed it is investigating. In a rare public statement, the agency said it was taking the allegations seriously. Mr Morrison said he found the reports troubling, but warned against ""leaping to conclusions"". On Sunday, Nine's 60 Minutes programme reported thatsuspected Chinese agents approached a luxury car dealer, Bo ""Nick"" Zhao,,externalahead of Australia's general election - which took place in May. They allegedly offered him A$1m (Â£520,000; $680,000) to fund his run for a Melbourne seat as a candidate for the ruling Liberal Party, of which Mr Zhao was already a member. 'I'm in Australia but I feel censored by Chinese students' Why China's rise exposes Australian vulnerabilities Mr Zhao gave information about the alleged approach to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (Asio) last year, Nine reported. He was found dead in a hotel room in Melbourne in March. Police have not been able to establish how or why he died, and his death has prompted a coroner's inquiry. Nine has also reported that a man claiming to be a Chinese spy has applied for asylum in Australia, in an unrelated case. Wang ""William"" Liqiang has reportedly given authorities informationabout operations in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Australia, saying he was ""personally involved"" in espionage work. Wang Liqiang told Australian media on Saturday he had been a spy for China Mr Wang also told 60 Minutes that he was aware of several Chinese spies operating in Australia and attempting to influence politics. Chinese officials have dismissed Mr Wang's claim, and say that he is an unemployed fugitive who was convicted of fraud before fleeing his homeland on a fake passport. In a statement, Asio director-general Mike Burgess said: ""Australians can be reassured that Asio was previously aware of matters that have been reported today, and has been actively investigating them."" He said he would not comment further in line with ""long-standing practice"", but added: ""Hostile foreign intelligence activity continues to pose a real threat to our nation and its security."" Mr Morrison said his government was determined to keep Australians ""free and safe"", but urged people not to draw conclusions while an investigation took place. ""Australia is not naive to the threats that it faces more broadly,"" he told reporters on Monday. This video can not be played Is China trying to exert influence in Australia? MP Andrew Hastie, who heads the parliament's intelligence and security committee, told 60 Minutes he had been aware of the ""very, very concerning"" allegations for months. ""[It is] like something out of a spy novel happening in Melbourne with impunity,"" he said. Critical Australian politicians banned from China 'China influence' book divisive in Australia debate But Chinese officials have dismissed the allegations, saying Beijing does not meddle in the internal politics of other countries.  Foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang accused people and media outlets of having ""become seized with imaginary fears"". ""They constantly fabricate cases of so-called Chinese spies infiltrating Australia,"" he told reporters on Monday. There is an ongoing debate about Chinese influence in Australian politics and society. Some politicians have accused Beijing of trying to infiltrate Canberra through donations and other means. Others, however, believe the allegations are fuelling xenophobia and putting at risk the nation's prosperity because China is Australia's largest trading partner. Australia passed new laws last yearaimed at countering foreign interference. At the time, then Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull acknowledged ""disturbing reports about Chinese influence"" - an assertion that has been consistently denied by Beijing, which has sometimes accused Australia of having a ""Cold War mentality"".

"Mo Robinson is accused of 39 counts of manslaughter A lorry driver who is accused over the deaths of 39 migrants in Essex has admitted plotting to assist illegal immigration. Maurice Robinson pleaded guilty at the Old Bailey to conspiring with others to assist illegal immigration between 1 May 2018 and 24 October 2019. The 25-year-old, from County Armagh, is accused of being part of a larger plot to bring people into the UK illegally. Mr Robinson was not asked to plead to 39 charges of manslaughter. The charges relate to the deaths of 39 Vietnamese people, including children, who were discovered in the back of a refrigerated lorry being driven by Mr Robinson in Grays on 23 October. Mr Robinson, who appeared via video-link from Belmarsh prison, also admitted acquiring criminal property - namely cash - between 1 May 2018 and 24 October 2019. As well as the manslaughter charges, Mr Robinson is accused of conspiracy to commit human trafficking offences and transferring criminal property.

"Children exposed to roadside air pollution could have their lung growth stunted by up to 14%, a study suggests. Living within 50m of a major road could increase the risk of lung cancer by up to 10%, the paper also found. The study of 13 cities in the UK and Poland found air pollution contributes to a higher chance of heart disease, strokes, heart failure and bronchitis. Campaigners called on the government to commit to tackling ""dangerous"" air pollution in the UK. The report written by King's College London analysed 13 health conditions in people living in high pollution areas and compared them to the general population. It focused not just on hospital admissions and deaths but also symptoms such as chest infections. The study found roadside air pollution stunted lung growth in children by approximately 14% in Oxford, 13% in London, 8% in Birmingham, 5% in Liverpool, 3% in Nottingham and 4% in Southampton. Researchers also said if air pollution was cut by a fifth, there would be thousands fewer cases of children with symptoms of bronchitis across those UK cities. ""Air pollution makes us, and especially our children, sick from cradle to the grave, but is often invisible,"" said Dr Rob Hughes, senior fellow at the Clean Air Fund. ""This impressive research makes this public health crisis - which affects people all across the UK - visible, and shows the urgency with which all political parties must prioritise cleaning up our air."" Dr Penny Woods, chief executive of the British Lung Foundation, called on the UK government to legally commit to the World Health Organisation's targets to clean up the country's ""dangerous"" air. WHO's clean air targetis for 40 Âµg/m3 - 40 micrograms of annual nitrogen dioxide per cubic metre of air,external. ""It seems as if every day we see more and more evidence of the terrible health effects air pollution is having on our lungs,"" Dr Woods said. ""It's the most vulnerable that are hit hardest,"" she added. ""We know air pollution stunts our children's still-developing lungs and those with a lung condition can find their symptoms are made far worse by poor air quality.""

"Navy Secretary Richard Spencer said he and Trump did not have the same view of ""discipline"" US Navy chief Richard Spencer has been fired over his handling of the case of a Navy Seal demoted for misconduct. The case of Edward Gallagher, who was convicted for posing with a corpse, had sparked tensions between US President Donald Trump and military officials. The navy officer had been due to face a disciplinary review where he could have been stripped of his Seals membership. There have been differing accounts as to why Richard Spencer was asked to resign. US Defence Secretary Mark Esper said,externalhe had lost confidence in the navy secretary because his private conversations with the White House contradicted his public position. However, Mr Trump said he was not happy with ""cost overruns"" and how Chief Petty Officer Gallagher's trial was run, and suggested this was why Mr Spencer was fired. The White House revolving door: Who's gone? Meanwhile, in a strongly worded letter, Mr Spencer said it was apparent that he and Mr Trump did not have the same view of ""good order and discipline"". ""The lives of our Sailors, Marines and civilian teammates quite literally depend on the professional execution of our many missions,"" he said. Mr Trump has drawn criticism from parts of the military after pardoning army officers convicted of war crimes. Gallagher was accused of stabbing an unarmed 17-year-old Islamic State group prisoner to death and randomly shooting civilians while serving in Iraq in 2017. He was acquitted of those charges and convicted only of the lesser charge of posing with the IS prisoner's corpse. A murder trial that tore band of brothers apart For that, he was demoted, but President Trump later reinstated his rank. Gallagher was formally notified by navy leaders last week that he would face a disciplinary review which could result in his being stripped of his membership of the Seals. Mr Trump tweeted his disapproval of this on Thursday, saying the navy would ""NOT be taking away Warfighter and Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher's Trident Pin"". On Sunday, the defence department said Mr Esper had asked Mr Spencer to resign due to ""his lack of candour"". Mr Spencer had made private proposals to the White House, which he did not share with Mr Esper, and had contradicted his public position, Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffmann said in a statement. According to the Washington Post,,externalMr Spencer had privately suggested to White House officials that if they did not interfere with proceedings against Edward Gallagher, he would ensure that the officer retired as a Navy Seal. However, the New York Times quoted defence officials as saying Mr Trump had been angered by reports that Mr Spencer had threatened to resign if the president intervened in the case. US Navy Seal accused of killing IS teen US war crimes accused wins pre-trial release Mr Trump tweeted on Sunday he was not happy with how the navy had handled Gallagher's trial, and high costs in the navy's contracting procedures. ""Therefore, Secretary of the Navy Richard Spencer's services have been terminated,"" he said, adding: ""Eddie will retire peacefully with all of the honours that he has earned, including his Trident pin."" In his resignation letter to President Trump, Mr Spencer wrote: ""The rule of law is what sets us apart from our adversaries. Good order and discipline is what has enabled our victory against foreign tyranny time and again."" ""Unfortunately, it has become apparent that in this respect, I no longer share the same understanding with the Commander in Chief who appointed me, in regards to the key principle of good order and discipline. ""I cannot in good conscience obey an order that I believe violates the sacred oath I took."" Senior Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer commended Richard Spencer for ""standing up to President Trump when he was wrong, something too many in this administration and the Republican Party are scared to do"". Navy Seal Special Operations Chief Edward Gallagher was accused of war crimes in Iraq Mr Esper has instructed that Gallagher be allowed to retire as a Navy Seal, retaining his Trident pin which symbolises membership of the elite unit. While Mr Esper had wanted the disciplinary process to ""play itself out objectively"", he had decided to let Gallagher keep his pin ""given the events of the last few days"", defence spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said in a statement. He had concluded Gallagher could not receive fair treatment in his case from the navy, AP news reported. ""Secretary Esper will meet with Navy Under Secretary (now Acting Secretary) Thomas Modley and the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Michael Gilday, on Monday morning to discuss the way ahead,"" the statement said.

"Prime Minister Boris Johnson spoke at the launch in Telford, Shropshire Wales would get ""major investments"" in infrastructure and industry if the Conservative Party wins the general election, its manifesto claims. The document, launched in Telford, Shropshire, on Sunday, promises to ""deliver"" on the decision of the Welsh people to leave the European Union. It says the party is ""ambitious"" for the Welsh economy and the union. The59-page manifesto,externalcomes 18 days before the general election. General election 2019: Boris Johnson vows to 'forge a new Britain' A really simple guide to the UK general election Who should I vote for? Election policy guide The manifesto also says if there was a Welsh Conservative government in Cardiff Bay it would deliver an M4 relief road. Road transport decisions are devolved to Wales' National Assembly, and are not the responsibility of the UK government. First Minister Mark Drakefordaxed the M4 relief roadin June because of its cost and impact on the environment. This video can not be played What does devolution mean for voters? The manifesto says the Conservative government worked to bringIneos Automotive to Bridgend in September, which is expected to create 500 new jobs, and it would ""continue to back Welsh car manufacturing"". It also states: ""Conservatives are proud of Welsh language and culture. ""We will support Welsh institutions such as S4C, the national library and museum, the Urdd and the National Eisteddfod. ""We will support the ambition for one million people in Wales to be able to speak Welsh by 2050."" Election translator: Key words explained Who hasn't yet registered to vote in the election? Other policies that apply to Wales include: 20,000 more police officers across Wales and England A ""triple tax lock"", ruling out increases in the UK rate of income tax and National Insurance, as well as VAT, for five years Raising the National Insurance threshold to Â£9,500 in 2020, with an ambition to raise it further to Â£12,500 Tighter immigration controls Speaking at the launch, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the choice facing the UK in this ""closely fought"" contest had ""never been starker"". ""Get Brexit done and we can focus our hearts and minds on the priorities of the British people,"" he added. Responding to the launch, Plaid Cymru candidate for Dwyfor Meirionnydd Liz Saville Roberts said: ""Unsurprisingly Wales is just an afterthought in this manifesto, with a handful of mentions. ""Boris Johnson and the Conservatives care little and know even less about what our nation needs... he wants to force Brexit through despite the fact that it would be disastrous for Wales."" And Welsh Labour's Economy and Transport Minister Ken Skates said: ""The Tories have absolutely nothing to be proud about when it comes to transport investment. ""Not only have they starved the Welsh Labour government of funding, they have historically underinvested in Welsh rail infrastructure which is their clear responsibility."" If you were looking for a long list of sparkling new projects for Wales, then look elsewhere. The section of the manifesto dedicated to Wales is mostly a list of platitudes (""we are ambitious for the Welsh economy""), previous announcements (West Wales Parkway station), and devolved issues that are not relevant to this election (develop an M4 relief road). Of course, many of the Tories' UK-wide tax and benefit proposals will have a major impact on people in Wales - the ""triple lock"" on the state pension; no increases in income tax, National Insurance and VAT; the continued roll-out of Universal Credit. But Boris Johnson's main election pitch is summed up in just a few lines: ""Only the Welsh Conservatives can end the current uncertainty by delivering on the democratic decision of the Welsh people to Leave"" the European Union.

"This video can not be played ""An electric baton to the back of the head"" - a former inmate described conditions at a secret camp to the BBC Leaked documents detail for the first time China's systematic brainwashing of hundreds of thousands of Muslims in a network of high-security prison camps. The Chinese government has consistently claimed the camps in the far western Xinjiang region offer voluntary education and training. But official documents, seen byBBC Panorama, show how inmates are locked up, indoctrinated and punished. China's UK ambassador dismissed the documents as fake news. The leak was made to theInternational Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ),external, which has worked with 17 media partners, including BBC Panorama and The Guardian newspaper in the UK. The investigation has found new evidence which undermines Beijing's claim that the detention camps, which have been built across Xinjiang in the past three years, are for voluntary re-education purposes to counter extremism. About a million people - mostly from the Muslim Uighur community - are thought to have been detained without trial. 'I spent seven days of hell in Chinese camps' The leading Uighur geographer who vanished in China The leaked Chinese government documents, which the ICIJ have labelled ""The China Cables"", include a nine-page memo sent out in 2017 by Zhu Hailun, then deputy-secretary of Xinjiang's Communist Party and the region's top security official, to those who run the camps. The instructions make it clear that the camps should be run as high security prisons, with strict discipline, punishments and no escapes. The Chinese government says the camps are for voluntary re-education The memo includes orders to: ""Never allow escapes"" ""Increase discipline and punishment of behavioural violations"" ""Promote repentance and confession"" ""Make remedial Mandarin studies the top priority"" ""Encourage students to truly transform"" ""[Ensure] full video surveillance coverage of dormitories and classrooms free of blind spots"" The documents reveal how every aspect of a detainee's life is monitored and controlled: ""The students should have a fixed bed position, fixed queue position, fixed classroom seat, and fixed station during skills work, and it is strictly forbidden for this to be changed. ""Implement behavioural norms and discipline requirements for getting up, roll call, washing, going to the toilet, organising and housekeeping, eating, studying, sleeping, closing the door and so forth."" Other documents confirm the extraordinary scale of the detentions. One reveals that 15,000 people from southern Xinjiang were sent to the camps over the course of just one week in 2017. Sophie Richardson, the China director at Human Rights Watch, said the leaked memo should be used by prosecutors. ""This is an actionable piece of evidence, documenting a gross human rights violation,"" she said. ""I think it's fair to describe everyone being detained as being subject at least to psychological torture, because they literally don't know how long they're going to be there. The memo details how detainees will only be released when they can demonstrate they have transformed their behaviour, beliefs and language. ""Promote the repentance and confession of the students for them to understand deeply the illegal, criminal and dangerous nature of their past activity,"" it says. ""For those who harbour vague understandings, negative attitudes or even feelings of resistanceâ¦ carry out education transformation to ensure that results are achieved."" Ben Emmerson QC, a leading human rights lawyer and an adviser to the World Uighur Congress, said the camps were trying to change people's identity. ""It is very difficult to view that as anything other than a mass brainwashing scheme designed and directed at an entire ethnic community. ""It's a total transformation that is designed specifically to wipe the Muslim Uighurs of Xinjiang as a separate cultural group off the face of the Earth."" The long read: China's hidden camps Explainer: China's Muslim 'crackdown' Searching for truth in China's 're-education' camps China denies Muslim children separation campaign Detainees are awarded points for their ""ideological transformation, study and training, and compliance with discipline"", the memo says. The punishment-and-reward system helps determine whether inmates are allowed contact with family and when they are released. They are only considered for release once four Communist Party committees have seen evidence they have been transformed. The leaked documents also reveal how the Chinese government uses mass surveillance and a predictive-policing programme that analyses personal data. One document shows how the system flagged 1.8m people simply because they had a data sharing app called Zapya on their phone. The authorities then ordered the investigation of 40,557 of them ""one by one"". The document says ""if it is not possible to eliminate suspicion"" they should be sent for ""concentrated training"". The documents include explicit directives to arrest Uighurs with foreign citizenship and to track Uighurs living abroad. They suggest that China's embassies and consulates are involved in the global dragnet. Chinese ambassador to the UK Liu Xiaoming said the measures had safeguarded local people and there had not been a single terrorist attack in Xinjiang in the past three years. ""The region now enjoys social stability and unity among ethnic groups. People there are living a happy life with a much stronger sense of fulfilment and security. ""In total disregard of the facts, some people in the West have been fiercely slandering and smearing China over Xinjiang in an attempt to create an excuse to interfere in China's internal affairs, disrupt China's counter-terrorism efforts in Xinjiang and thwart China's steady development.""

"This video can not be played England in New Zealand: Joe Root denies he's under pressure after losing first Test First Test, Bay Oval, Mount Maunganui, day five of five: England 353 & 197: Denly 35, Burns 31, Wagner 5-44 New Zealand 615-9 dec:Watling 205, Santner 126, De Grandhomme 65 New Zealand won by innings & 65 runs Scorecard England were crushed by New Zealand as the tourists lost the first Test by an innings and 65 runs at the Bay Oval. Resuming on 55-3, England needed to bat through the day to save the Test but were bowled out for 197 with 21.4 overs remaining in Mount Maunganui. Joe Denly made 35 from 142 balls and Ben Stokes 28 from 84 but no batsman could produce a defining innings. Pace bowler Neil Wagner took a superb 5-44 and Mitchell Santner 3-53 as the Black Caps secured a 1-0 series lead. The second and final Test begins at 22:00 GMT on Thursday. New Zealand could be without Trent Boult, who was absent for much of the day with a rib injury, but the performance of his other bowlers will offer captain Kane Williamson some reassurance. England were let down by their shot making and will be left to rue the collapse on the second day that prevented them posting a substantial total. It is perhaps fortunate for England the series is not part of theWorld Test Championship,,externalmeaning that they have not lost out on any points in defeat. But it was a fine all-round performance from New Zealand, and leaves England with plenty to ponder before they travel to Hamilton. England cannot panic after NZ loss - Root NZ showed England how to play Tests - Agnew TMS podcast: I don't feel under pressure - Root NZ bowler Boult doubtful for second Test How day five unfolded Ben Stokes was furious after dragging a wide Tim Southee delivery on to his stumps Stuart Broad said before play on day five that England ""don't just believe we can save this game, we expect to"". At times, it looked as though they might. Joe Root and Denly batted serenely in the first hour of the day and Stokes and Denly showed real grit in their 52-run stand. While New Zealand were disciplined with the ball, limiting England's scoring options, the tourists were largely architects of their own downfall. They were passive and, when they did decide to hit out, they picked the wrong shot to the wrong ball. Root was caught tamely at gully off a Colin de Grandhomme short ball, Stokes dragged a wide delivery on to his stumps, Ollie Pope thrashed another wide ball to short cover, where Santner took a superb diving catch, and Jos Buttler was bowled leaving a yorker. Only Denly could really claim to have fallen to a good ball, a rising short delivery from Wagner that caught his glove as he tried to shoulder arms. Much of England's pre-series talk was about patience, and they had the perfect template to follow after watching BJ Watling's lengthy double century over the previous two days. On this evidence, it will be a long learning process. Neil Wagner has a Test bowling average of 27.04 for New Zealand New Zealand are second in the Test rankings and in this victory they demonstrated why - this was a complete performance, grinding England down with the bat before preying on the tourists' long-held batting weaknesses. With strike bowler Boult only able to bowl one over before walking off with a rib injury, New Zealand had to rely on their change bowlers to take the wickets. A superb spell from Wagner, who switched to round the wicket after becoming frustrated with the footholes, did the damage. Known as a bowler who favours short-pitched bowling, he instead used his variations with the old ball and found movement with the new one in Boult's absence. Sam Curran and Jofra Archer provided some late entertainment but it never felt as though New Zealand were panicked, and Wagner wrapped up the innings in consecutive balls to dismiss Archer and Broad. Left-arm spinner Santner did not add to his three wickets from overnight, but he found enough turn and bounce to keep England's batsmen wary. Should Boult miss the next Test, New Zealand could call on extra pace, in the form of Lockie Ferguson - the second highest wicket taker at this summer's World Cup - or Matt Henry. They have plenty of options - something which England will be wary of. Joe Root (left) and Joe Denly shared a 14-run stand in the first hour on Sunday England captain Joe Root:""We did a lot of good stuff - we just need to do it for longer. It's different to the style of cricket we've had to play in our home conditions. ""We can't panic and think it's the end of the world. We are working hard behind the scenes and if we come back strong, we'll hopefully level it up."" Ex-England batsman Mark Ramprakash on TMS:""England didn't quite get their mentality right. ""Stokes said runs would be important, but they didn't bat normally. England went nowhere. It's that indecision that cost Root his wicket."" New Zealand captain Kane Williamson:""It feels great to win a Test match and it took a huge amount of work to get past their total. ""It was huge heart from our middle order to get over 600 and that gave us the only chance of winning."" England bowler Steven Finn on TMS:""There are lessons for England to learn. ""If you look at England's first innings, they'd laid a platform after day one but didn't capitalise on day two, and that's probably the difference.""

"More than one in 10 cancer patients die from heart and blood vessel problems, rather than their initial illness, a study says. The European Heart Journal looked at three million US patients, with 28 different cancers, over 40 years. The researchers say the increase in the numbers surviving cancer means more attention should be focused on cardiovascular risk. UK experts say doctors should be more aware and monitor patients accordingly. Among the 3.23 million cancer patients studied, 38% died from cancer and 11% from cardiovascular diseases (CVD) - of which, three-quarters were from heart disease. The proportion of cancer survivors dying from CVD was highest in those with disease of the bladder, larynx, prostate, womb, bowel and breast. The risk in the first year could be explained by the effects of chemotherapy or radiation treatment on people's bodies. But rates continued to be higher than those in the general population. The study said cancer patients were ""perpetually at elevated risk"". Dr Nicholas Zaorsky, a radiation oncologist, from Penn State Cancer Institute, who led the study, said knowing about the risk could help patients live more healthily in the long term. ""Increasing awareness of this risk may spur cancer survivors to implement healthy lifestyle behaviours that not only decrease their risk of cardiovascular disease, but also the risk of cancer recurrence."" Martin Ledwick, head cancer information nurse at Cancer Research UK, said: ""Doctors should be aware of this research as it suggests cancer patients need to be monitored more closely after treatment, for heart disease and stroke. ""But it doesn't tell us why some cancer patients may be at higher risk of dying from cardiovascular disease. ""For some, it might be treatment-related - radiotherapy to the chest and some chemotherapy drugs can lead to a higher risk of heart disease. ""But some of the cancers included in the study share lifestyle risk factors with cardiovascular disease - for example, obesity and smoking, which might also explain the increased risk. ""This is another reason why it's important for everyone to have a healthy lifestyle."" Prof Metin Avkiran, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said the study offered further evidence that, compared with the general population, cancer survivors are at much greater risk of death from heart and circulatory diseases. He added: ""We need more research to understand why this is, and whether factors other than the known damaging effects of some anti-cancer treatments on the heart and blood vessels are at play. ""What is becoming increasingly clear is that cancer doctors and cardiologists need to work together from an early stage to try and minimise the risk of patients surviving cancer but succumbing to heart and circulatory diseases.""

"Supporters of a pro-democracy candidate celebrate as results in the district election were announced Hong Kong's opposition pro-democracy movement has made unprecedented gains in the Chinese territory's district council elections, early results show. According to local media counts, 17 of the 18 councils are now controlled by pro-democracy councillors. Despite fears the vote could be disrupted or cancelled over the unrest, it went ahead peacefully. The election was seen as a test of support for the government after months of unrest, protests and clashes. The government and Beijing had been hoping the election would bring a show of support from the so-called ""silent majority"", but that did not materialise. Instead some significant pro-Beijing candidates lost council seats. One controversial pro-Beijing lawmaker, who lost his seat, Junius Ho, said ""heaven and earth have been turned upside down"". Protests explained in 100 and 500 words How is Hong Kong run and how much control does China have? The twists and turns in Hong Kong so far Hong Kong's district councillors have little political power and mainly deal with local issues such as bus routes and rubbish collection, so the district elections don't normally generate such interest. But these polls were the first time people could express at the ballot box their opinion on embattled Chief Executive Carrie Lam's handling of the crisis, which was sparked by a now withdrawn extradition law. Also, 117 of the district councillors will also sit on the 1,200-member committee that votes for the chief executive, so a pro-democracy district win could translate eventually to a bigger share, and say, in who becomes the city's next leader. The vote was seen as a referendum on Chief Executive Carrie Lam A record 4.1 million people had registered to vote - more than half the population - and more than 2.9m people cast votes. That's a turnout of more than 71%, against 47% in 2015. The weekend was also the first in months without any clashes between protesters and police. Over the past months,demonstrations and unrest had been gradually escalating. Police have at times used live rounds, wounding several protesters. Activists in turn have attacked police or in one case set alight a government supporter. It was unclear how much of the general population still supported the protesters, and authorities had been hoping the election would identify the protesters as a small group of fringe extremists. But in many districts, young first-time candidates, many who had explicitly aligned themselves with the protesters, unseated established politicians backing the government. The hope from activists is that the overwhelming victory of anti-establishment parties will force the government to take protesters' demands more seriously. This video can not be played The history behind Hong Kong's identity crisis and protests - first broadcast November 2019 Stephen McDonell, BBC China correspondent, in Hong Kong Outside the Yau Ma Tei North polling station, local residents lined up to gain entry so they could watch the vote count. The doors opened and they poured into the public viewing area. Six months into an ongoing political crisis, people have lost faith in government institutions. They wanted to make sure that this process was fair and transparent. As they waited for the total in their own district council to be tallied, they could see the numbers coming in from elsewhere on their mobile phones. By their facial expressions it was clear they couldn't believe what was unfolding, and people cheered in astonishment as one surprising result came in after another. Nobody imagined such a comprehensive wipeout, and Carrie Lam's administration will no doubt come under renewed pressure to listen to the demands of protestors following such an overwhelming defeat for her and her allies. More than 1,000 candidates ran for 452 district council seats which, for the first time, were all contested. A further 27 district seats are allocated to representatives of rural districts. Pro-Beijing parties held the majority of these seats ahead of the election. In one of the biggest losses for the pro-Beijing camp, lawmaker Junius Ho - one of Hong Kong's most controversial politicians - suffered a shock defeat. He was stabbed earlier this monthby a man pretending to be a supporter. The lawmaker has openly voiced his support for Hong Kong's police force on multiple occasions. He was in July filmed shaking hands with a group of men - suspected of being triad gangsters - who later assaulted pro-democracy protesters. As results were announced, pro-democracy supporters were in high spirits in Tuen Mun district Jimmy Sham, a political activist who has recently risen to prominence as the leader of the Civil Human Rights Front - a campaign group responsible for organising some of the mass protest marches - won a seat after running for the first time. Mr Sham has also been attacked twice, once apparently with hammers. Photographs at the time showed him lying on the street covered in blood. After the vote, Mr Sham said ""we have to be leaders of the community that listens to people's voices and opinions"". This video can not be played Joshua Wong says Beijing can't keep him down Pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong was barred from running in the elections, a move he referred to as ""political screening"", but the pro-democracy candidate who replaced him has won. In a tweet, Mr Wong said the ""historic"" results showed that public opinion had not turned against the pro-democracy movement. Allow Twitter content?

Reflecting on her reported defeat, pro-Beijing lawmaker Alice Mak suggested Ms Lam's administration was partly to blame. ""In the election campaign, pro-government candidates have been unfairly treated. This is a very important reason,"" she said. Starry Lee Wai-king, chairwoman of the city's largest pro-Beijing party, was among the few establishment candidates to secure her seat.

"Pro-democracy voters celebrating in Hong Kong Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam has said the government will ""seriously reflect"" after local elections saw massive gains by pro-democracy candidates. Seventeen of the 18 district councils are now controlled by pro-democracy councillors, according to local media. The election, the first since the wave of anti-Beijing protests began, saw an unprecedented turnout of more than 71%. It is being seen as a stinging rebuke of Ms Lam's leadership and a show of support for the protest movement. Hong Kong's young winners and the veterans they toppled Hong Kong has seen months of increasingly violent protests since Ms Lam tried to introduce a controversial bill enabling extradition to China. Carrie Lam has become increasingly unpopular in Hong Kong In a statement released online,externalon Monday, Ms Lam said the government respected the results. She said many felt the results reflected ""people's dissatisfaction with the current situation and the deep-seated problems in society"". The government would ""listen to the opinions of members of the public humbly and seriously reflect"", she said. Some 2.94 million people voted in the election, compared with 1.4 million in 2015. Pro-democracy candidates won close to 60% of the total vote on Sunday, but achieved a landslide in terms of seats because of the first-past-the-post system, local media report. Pro-democracy contenders were victorious in 347 of the 452 district council seats up for grabs; pro-Beijing candidates won 60 seats; while independents - many of them pro-democracy - got 45, according to the South China Morning Post. In the last election four years ago, pro-Beijing councillors won 298 seats, but the distribution of these seats meant they took control of all 18 district councils. They retained control of only the Islands District Council after Sunday's vote. The territory's district councillors have little political power and mainly deal with local issues such as bus routes and rubbish collection, so the district elections do not normally generate such interest. This video can not be played A winner and a loser in Hong Kong's historic poll result But the councillors also get to choose 117 of their number to sit on the 1,200-member committee that selects Hong Kong's chief executive, who is then formally appointed by the Chinese government. The landslide results mean all of those 117 seats are now likely to go to pro-democracy candidates, so they will have a greater influence over that decision, which is set to be made in 2022. Read more on how Hong Kong is run But the result is also highly symbolic, as it was the first opportunity for people to express at the ballot box their view of Ms Lam's handling of the crisis. The government, and China's leaders in Beijing, had been hoping the election would bring a show of support from the so-called ""silent majority"" which they say disapproves of the protests. But that did not materialise - instead some high-profile pro-Beijing candidates lost their seats as voters  backed pro-democracy candidates. The hope from activists is that the overwhelming victory of anti-establishment parties will force the government to take their demands more seriously. This video can not be played The history behind Hong Kong's identity crisis and protests - first broadcast November 2019 UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said he welcomed the holding of the elections, which he described as ""an important opportunity for the people of Hong Kong to make their voices heard"". ""There is now an opportunity to find a way through the crisis with political dialogue that reflects the legitimate aspirations of the people of Hong Kong and respects the one country two systems model,"" he said. By Jonathan Head, BBC News, Hong Kong So what now? Will the protests resume? It seems almost certain they will, unless the government starts responding to protesters' demands. Carrie Lam has acknowledged that the results show dissatisfaction with her administration, and promised to listen in a spirit of humility. But she can only make concessions if China agrees. Beijing may prefer to see her replaced by a less toxic figure. But there are challenges too for the opposition. The new intake of young councillors will have to take on the responsibility of addressing local concerns, like public transport and other amenities, rather than the grander ideals of democracy. They will need to work together more effectively than they have in the past, and work out how the demands and tactics of more radical protesters can most effectively be channelled to get concessions from a Chinese central government unnerved by yet another show of defiance in Hong Kong. There has been no official comment from Beijing. But Foreign Minister Wang Yi, speaking in Japan, reiterated that ""no matter what happens, Hong Kong is a part of China"". ""Any attempt to mess up Hong Kong, or even damage its prosperity and stability, will not succeed,"" he said. State media outlets have been cautious in reporting the results. State news agency Xinhua reported the votes had been counted, but did not detail the results. It said ""some rioters harassed patriotic candidates"" on election day, and that the ""most pressing task for Hong Kong at present is still to bring the violence and chaos to an end and restore order"". Meanwhile, the English edition of state-backed tabloid Global Times attributed the result to the ""abnormal"" circumstances which made it easier for the pro-democracy camp to mobilise their voters. It also alleged that ""Western forces"" have been supporting the opposition. Ahead of the vote, state media had been urging people to vote for stability and against the unrest. Hong Kong, once a British colony, is part of China, butit has some autonomy and people have more rightsthan on the mainland That special status is set to expire in 2047, and many in Hong Kong do not want to become ""another Chinese city"". The current protests started in June against a planned law which would have cleared the way for criminal suspects to be extradited to the mainland. Many feared this would undermine the city's freedoms or be used to silence anti-Beijing voices. The bill was withdrawn in September,but demonstrations continued. Clashes between police and activists have become increasingly violent, with police firing live bullets and protesters attacking officers with bows and arrows or throwing petrol bombs. The demands of the protesters, mostly young people, have expanded to include genuine universal suffrage and an inquiry into allegations of police brutality.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says ""prevarication and procrastination"" over Brexit have undermined trust in politics The Conservatives will ""get Brexit done"" and ""forge a new Britain"", Boris Johnson has said as he launched the party's election manifesto. He promised 50,000 more nurses in England and the creation of 50 million more GP appointments. Other pledges include tighter immigration controls and not to increase rates of income tax, national insurance and VAT. The59-page manifesto,externalcomes 18 days before the general election. Speaking at its launch in Telford, Shropshire, the prime minister said the choice facing the country in this ""closely fought"" contest had ""never been starker"". What's in the Conservative Party manifesto? What does 'Get Brexit done' mean? Kuenssberg: Tories seek to avoid manifesto calamity As it happened: Boris Johnson unveils Tory manifesto ""Get Brexit done and we can focus our hearts and minds on the priorities of the British people,"" he added. The manifesto, which the PM described as a ""partial blueprint"" for the future of the country, promises20,000 more police officersand to ""level up"" schools funding. Other policies include: A ""triple tax lock"", ruling out increases in the headline rate of income tax and National Insurance, as well as VAT, for five years Raising the National Insurance threshold to Â£9,500 in 2020, with an ambition to raise it further to Â£12,500 Childcare: Â£250m a year, for at least three years, plus a Â£250m capital spending boost, for ""wraparound"" childcare - meaning after school or during holidays Environment: Â£6.3bn for upgrades to homes, such as grants for improving boilers and insulation Â£500m a year for four years for filling potholes - almost 10 times the amount promised by the party in anannouncement in March,external A new National Skills Fund of Â£600m a year for five years.Labourand theLiberal Democratshave announced similar plans Building ""Northern Powerhouse Rail"" between Leeds and Manchester and investing Â£28.8bn in strategic and local roads A review of the ""relationship between the government, Parliament and courts"" There are no plans to repeal the Hunting Act, which bans the hunting of foxes and others wild mammals with dogs in England and Wales. BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said it was a pared-back, ""take-no-chances"" manifesto. A plan to lift income tax thresholds for middle-earners to Â£80,000, announced during the Tory leadership campaign, has been dropped, with Mr Johnson saying this ""was not the time"" for such a move. There is a pledge to increase the number of nurses in the NHS England workforce by 50,000 by 2024-5. The aim is to train 14,000 new graduates and undergraduates. It is hoped that expanded nurse apprenticeship schemes will bring 5,000 more recruits. Nursing maintenance grants scrapped in 2017 will be restored. These will fund student living costs up to Â£8,000 at an estimated cost of Â£760m in 2020-21, rising to Â£880m in 2023-4. A further 12,500 nurses will be recruited from abroad, through a new NHS visa. Finally, it is hoped that 18,500 nurses will stay in the profession or return to work through because of career development opportunities and an enhanced retention programme. The Conservatives' target for 50,000 more nurses in England by 2024 is an ambitious one. Around 19,000, according to the party, will come from extra training places and the incentive of reintroduced maintenance grants for students. This is something of a U-turn, as it was the Conservative government which scrapped the grants in 2017 after which the number of applicants for nursing degrees fell. The policy, though, involves retaining tuition fees - before 2017 nursing students did not have to pay these costs. That leaves more than half the target to come from overseas recruitment and better retention. The Conservative policy is to cut the cost of visas for foreign health staff but the surcharge to cover their healthcare costs will rise. The outlook for recruitment outside the UK looks uncertain. The party says there will be more effective retention of existing staff through continuing professional development and there will be measures to encourage nurses who have left the NHS to return to the workforce. Once again, that sounds fine in principle but achieving it is another matter. The prime minister promised to bring back theWithdrawal Agreement Billto Parliament before 25 December. The Conservatives want MPs to ratify the prime minister's Brexit deal before the UK is due to leave the EU on 31 January. After this there would be a ""transition period"" - during which the UK would continue to follow EU rules while the two sides try to work out a permanent trade deal. The manifesto rules out extending the transition period beyond the 31 December 2020 deadline. The House of Commons approved the Withdrawal Agreement Bill in principle in October. But it has to be reintroduced because Parliament was dissolved ahead of the election on 12 December. The Conservatives promise to negotiate a trade deal with the EU next year, and have confirmed as a written manifesto pledge that they will not extend the post-Brexit transition period beyond December 2020. That is an incredibly short amount of time to finalise a trade deal of any significant ambition, and it means the EU knows in advance what the UK's negotiating deadlines are. The Conservatives say the UK will be outside the EU single market, and any form of customs union. There will be no political alignment with the EU, the manifesto says, and it promises that the UK will be in full control of its fishing waters. But until we know the terms of a new relationship with the EU, business uncertainty will continue. And it will be hard to argue that Brexit has really been done. The manifesto promises free hospital parking in England for people with disabilities, frequent patients, the gravely ill, families of long-stay patients, carers and NHS staff working night shifts. The Conservative Party says Â£78m per year will be provided, which it claims is new funding for extra parking capacity, or compensation for lost fees.Labour wants to make hospital parking free for everyone in England, in line with Wales and Scotland. The manifesto promises Â£1bn per year in extra funding for care for the elderly over the next five years. The PM said he was willing to talk to other parties to come up with a long-term solution for funding the system. The ""triple lock"" on the UK state pension - meaning it will rise by the rate of average earnings, inflation or 2.5%, whichever is higher - will be retained as will the older person's free bus pass. The government says free TV licences for all over-75s should be maintained. The BBC - which is now responsible for administering them - has said only those on pension credit will get them free in the future. Despite their big spending commitments, the Conservatives say they are committed to fiscal discipline and all their proposals are costed. Anaccompanying document,external- setting out how the plans will be paid for - says there will be no borrowing to pay for day-to-day spending and the budget will remain in balance. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank, said the party's pledge not to raise taxes could ""come back to bite"" it, as it could limit the ability to deal with costs to the NHS from an ageing society. And Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the manifesto was ""paid for by billionaires, written by billionaires and delivered by billionaires - the problem is the rest of us will end up paying for it"". Here's a concise guide to where the parties stand on key issues like Brexit, education and the NHS. General election policy guide Brexit:Labour is promising to negotiate a new Brexit deal within three months, based on close alignment with the EU. This would then be put to the public in a legally binding referendum, alongside the option of staying in the EU. The Liberal Democrats have vowed to cancel Brexit if elected as a majority government, or otherwise campaign for a referendum with the option of staying in the EU. The SNP wants Scotland to stay in the EU and the Brexit Party says the UK should leave immediately without an exit deal, but negotiate a free trade agreement with the EU. Taxes:Labour has set out plans to raise income tax for the top 5% of earners and reverse cuts to corporation tax in order to increase public spending. The Liberal Democrats would bring in a 1p rise in income tax to spend on health and social care. The Brexit Party wants to scrap corporation tax for companies earning less than Â£10,000 a year, ditch VAT for fuel bills and abolish inheritance tax. Childcare:Labour has pledged that within five years two, three and four-year-olds will be entitled to 30 hours of free pre-school education per week. The Lib Dems are offering to fund 35 hours of childcare, 48 weeks a year for children aged two to four. Do you have any questions about the election?

"Navy Secretary Richard Spencer said he and Trump did not have the same view of ""discipline"" US Navy chief Richard Spencer has been fired over his handling of the case of a Navy Seal demoted for misconduct. The case of Edward Gallagher, who was convicted for posing with a corpse, had sparked tensions between US President Donald Trump and military officials. The navy officer had been due to face a disciplinary review where he could have been stripped of his Seals membership. There have been differing accounts as to why Richard Spencer was asked to resign. US Defence Secretary Mark Esper said,externalhe had lost confidence in the navy secretary because his private conversations with the White House contradicted his public position. However, Mr Trump said he was not happy with ""cost overruns"" and how Chief Petty Officer Gallagher's trial was run, and suggested this was why Mr Spencer was fired. The White House revolving door: Who's gone? Meanwhile, in a strongly worded letter, Mr Spencer said it was apparent that he and Mr Trump did not have the same view of ""good order and discipline"". ""The lives of our Sailors, Marines and civilian teammates quite literally depend on the professional execution of our many missions,"" he said. Mr Trump has drawn criticism from parts of the military after pardoning army officers convicted of war crimes. Gallagher was accused of stabbing an unarmed 17-year-old Islamic State group prisoner to death and randomly shooting civilians while serving in Iraq in 2017. He was acquitted of those charges and convicted only of the lesser charge of posing with the IS prisoner's corpse. A murder trial that tore band of brothers apart For that, he was demoted, but President Trump later reinstated his rank. Gallagher was formally notified by navy leaders last week that he would face a disciplinary review which could result in his being stripped of his membership of the Seals. Mr Trump tweeted his disapproval of this on Thursday, saying the navy would ""NOT be taking away Warfighter and Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher's Trident Pin"". On Sunday, the defence department said Mr Esper had asked Mr Spencer to resign due to ""his lack of candour"". Mr Spencer had made private proposals to the White House, which he did not share with Mr Esper, and had contradicted his public position, Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffmann said in a statement. According to the Washington Post,,externalMr Spencer had privately suggested to White House officials that if they did not interfere with proceedings against Edward Gallagher, he would ensure that the officer retired as a Navy Seal. However, the New York Times quoted defence officials as saying Mr Trump had been angered by reports that Mr Spencer had threatened to resign if the president intervened in the case. US Navy Seal accused of killing IS teen US war crimes accused wins pre-trial release Mr Trump tweeted on Sunday he was not happy with how the navy had handled Gallagher's trial, and high costs in the navy's contracting procedures. ""Therefore, Secretary of the Navy Richard Spencer's services have been terminated,"" he said, adding: ""Eddie will retire peacefully with all of the honours that he has earned, including his Trident pin."" In his resignation letter to President Trump, Mr Spencer wrote: ""The rule of law is what sets us apart from our adversaries. Good order and discipline is what has enabled our victory against foreign tyranny time and again."" ""Unfortunately, it has become apparent that in this respect, I no longer share the same understanding with the Commander in Chief who appointed me, in regards to the key principle of good order and discipline. ""I cannot in good conscience obey an order that I believe violates the sacred oath I took."" Senior Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer commended Richard Spencer for ""standing up to President Trump when he was wrong, something too many in this administration and the Republican Party are scared to do"". Navy Seal Special Operations Chief Edward Gallagher was accused of war crimes in Iraq Mr Esper has instructed that Gallagher be allowed to retire as a Navy Seal, retaining his Trident pin which symbolises membership of the elite unit. While Mr Esper had wanted the disciplinary process to ""play itself out objectively"", he had decided to let Gallagher keep his pin ""given the events of the last few days"", defence spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said in a statement. He had concluded Gallagher could not receive fair treatment in his case from the navy, AP news reported. ""Secretary Esper will meet with Navy Under Secretary (now Acting Secretary) Thomas Modley and the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Michael Gilday, on Monday morning to discuss the way ahead,"" the statement said.

"This video can not be played Bloomberg to BBC in 2018: 'I'd like to make a difference' Billionaire former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg has officially announced he is standing to be the Democratic Party presidential nominee. In a statement,the 77-year-old said he was standing ""to defeat Donald Trump and rebuild America"",external. ""The stakes could not be higher. We must win this election,"" Mr Bloomberg wrote. He joins 17 other candidates vying for the Democratic nomination to take on Mr Trump in 2020. As things stand, former Vice-President Joe Biden, Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are the party's front-runners. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Bloomberg is said to be concerned the current field is not strong enough to challenge the president. Who will take on Trump in 2020? How  Bloomberg could shake up 2020 race He enters the race after months of debate over wealth inequality in the US, with Mr Sanders and Ms Warren announcing plans for steep tax rises for billionaires. Unveiling his tax proposals in September,Mr Sanders said: ""Billionaires should not exist."",external President Trump taunted Mr Bloomberg earlier in November, saying there was ""nobody I'd rather run against than little Michael"". This video can not be played 'Little Michael' Bloomberg will hurt Biden - Trump The same day, Mr Bloomberg filed paperwork for the Democratic primary election in Alabama. Michael Bloomberg is the eighth richest American with a net-worth of $54.4bn (Â£42bn), according to Forbes. Born in Massachusetts, he started out in business as a Wall Street banker before going on to create the financial publishing empire that bears his name. Over the years he has given millions of dollars to educational, medical and other causes - including political ones. He staged a successful campaign to become New York mayor in 2001 and remained in office for three consecutive terms until 2013. Rumours of presidential ambitions have surrounded him for more than a decade. Mr Bloomberg is a very data-driven businessman. But it doesn't take an advanced degree in quantitative analysis to realise that the Democratic field, even at this (relatively) late date is still in flux. There are four candidates at or near the top of early state and national primary polls - all with their strengths, of course, but also obvious weaknesses. His strategy appears to be to let the other candidates fight it out in the early voting states, then take on a diminished field later in the process, where his near unlimited resources will allow him to compete in the dozens of states that vote in March. It's a risky play that only someone of Mr Bloomberg's vast wealth can afford to make. Even so, it takes quite a leap of faith to imagine that Democrats these days are ready to jump over to a New York City plutocrat ex-Republican with a smorgasbord of a record that's business friendly, fiscally conservative and includes opposition to government-run health insurance and legalised marijuana, and past support for aggressive policing measures. At the very least, however, his entry will provide him a means to push a party that he sees drifting dangerous leftward back to the pro-business centre.

"More than one in 10 cancer patients die from heart and blood vessel problems, rather than their initial illness, a study says. The European Heart Journal looked at three million US patients, with 28 different cancers, over 40 years. The researchers say the increase in the numbers surviving cancer means more attention should be focused on cardiovascular risk. UK experts say doctors should be more aware and monitor patients accordingly. Among the 3.23 million cancer patients studied, 38% died from cancer and 11% from cardiovascular diseases (CVD) - of which, three-quarters were from heart disease. The proportion of cancer survivors dying from CVD was highest in those with disease of the bladder, larynx, prostate, womb, bowel and breast. The risk in the first year could be explained by the effects of chemotherapy or radiation treatment on people's bodies. But rates continued to be higher than those in the general population. The study said cancer patients were ""perpetually at elevated risk"". Dr Nicholas Zaorsky, a radiation oncologist, from Penn State Cancer Institute, who led the study, said knowing about the risk could help patients live more healthily in the long term. ""Increasing awareness of this risk may spur cancer survivors to implement healthy lifestyle behaviours that not only decrease their risk of cardiovascular disease, but also the risk of cancer recurrence."" Martin Ledwick, head cancer information nurse at Cancer Research UK, said: ""Doctors should be aware of this research as it suggests cancer patients need to be monitored more closely after treatment, for heart disease and stroke. ""But it doesn't tell us why some cancer patients may be at higher risk of dying from cardiovascular disease. ""For some, it might be treatment-related - radiotherapy to the chest and some chemotherapy drugs can lead to a higher risk of heart disease. ""But some of the cancers included in the study share lifestyle risk factors with cardiovascular disease - for example, obesity and smoking, which might also explain the increased risk. ""This is another reason why it's important for everyone to have a healthy lifestyle."" Prof Metin Avkiran, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said the study offered further evidence that, compared with the general population, cancer survivors are at much greater risk of death from heart and circulatory diseases. He added: ""We need more research to understand why this is, and whether factors other than the known damaging effects of some anti-cancer treatments on the heart and blood vessels are at play. ""What is becoming increasingly clear is that cancer doctors and cardiologists need to work together from an early stage to try and minimise the risk of patients surviving cancer but succumbing to heart and circulatory diseases.""
